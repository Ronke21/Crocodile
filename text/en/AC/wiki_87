<text>HOTOL, for Horizontal Take-Off and Landing, was a 1980s British design for a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) spaceplane that was to be powered by an airbreathing jet engine. Development was being conducted by a consortium led by Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace (BAe).

Designed as a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) reusable winged launch vehicle, HOTOL was to be fitted with a unique air-breathing engine, the RB545 or Swallow, that was under development by British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce. The propellant for the engine technically consisted of a combination of liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen; however, it was to employ a new means of dramatically reducing the amount of oxidizer needed to be carried on board by utilising atmospheric oxygen as the spacecraft climbed through the lower atmosphere. Since the oxidizer typically represents the majority of the takeoff weight of a rocket, HOTOL was to be considerably smaller than normal pure-rocket designs, roughly the size of a medium-haul airliner such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-9/MD-80.

While HOTOL&#x27;s proof-of-concept design study was being carried out, attempts were made by both industry and the British government to establish international cooperation to develop, produce, and deploy the spacecraft. In spite of American interest in the programme, there was little appetite amongst the members of the European Space Agency (ESA), and the British government was not prepared to depart from ESA cooperation. Additionally, technical issues were encountered, and there were allegations that comparisons with alternative launch systems such as conventional rocket vehicle using similar construction techniques failed to show much advantage to HOTOL. In 1989, funding for the project ended. The termination of development work on HOTOL led to the formation of Reaction Engines Limited (REL) to develop and produce Skylon, a proposed spacecraft based on HOTOL technologies, including its air-breathing engine.

==Development==
===Origins===
The ideas behind HOTOL originated from work done by British engineer Alan Bond in the field of pre-cooled jet engines. Bond had specifically performed this research with the intention of producing a viable engine for powering a space launch system. In 1982, British Aerospace (BAe), which was Europe&#x27;s principal satellite-builder, began studying a prospective new launch system with the aim of providing launch costs that were 20 per cent of the American Space Shuttle operated by NASA. BAe became aware of work by British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce on a suitable engine, and soon conceived of an unmanned, fully reusable single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) winged spaceplane as a launch vehicle.

Thus, the project had soon become a joint venture between BAe and Rolls-Royce, led by John Scott-Scott and Bob Parkinson. Early on, there was an ambition to &#x27;Europeanise&#x27; the project and to involve other nations in its development and manufacture as it was recognised that an estimated £4 billion would be needed to fund full-scale development. In August 1984, BAe unveiled a public display of the HOTOL satellite launcher project and released details on its proposed operations.

In December 1984, a Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) memorandum noted that West Germany was interested in the programme, while France had adopted a critical attitude towards HOTOL, which the ministry viewed as potentially due to it being seen as a competitor to French-led projects. According to Minister of Trade and Industry Geoffrey Pattie, French diplomatic pressure to gather support for its own proposed Hermes space vehicle had inadvertently generated support and interest amongst European Space Agency (ESA) members in the HOTOL project. Despite this climate of tentative interest and possible European support, there was a general attitude of reluctance within the British government to take the lead on a new space launcher.

===American interest and design study===
In March 1985, there were claims that Rolls-Royce was in the process of conducting licensing talks for HOTOL engine technology with American propulsion company Rocketdyne. In April 1985, Pattie wrote to Secretary of State for Defence Michael Heseltine to propose a two-year £3 million proof of concept study be performed under a public-private partnership arrangement, consisting of £1 million provided by the UK government and the remainder being financed by Rolls-Royce and BAe themselves. Pattie reasoned that the project would serve Britain&#x27;s &quot;strategic capability&quot;, and that tests of key technologies could foster international collaboration. According to aerospace publication &quot;Flight International&quot;, the support of the Ministry of Defense (MoD) was critical as the design of HOTOL&#x27;s engine had been classified.

In July 1985, Rolls-Royce&#x27;s technical director Gordon Lewis stated that the firm sought the involvement of the Royal Aircraft Establishment&#x27;s (RAE) propulsion group, and that Rolls-Royce was not prepared to invest its own funds into engine development for HOTOL. By the second half of 1985, work had commenced on the two-year concept-of-proof study. Early on, there was considerable pressure to demonstrate the project&#x27;s feasibility and credibility in advance of final decisions being taken by ESA on the Hermes and what would become the Ariane 5 launch system, thus the work concentrated on the validation of critical technologies involved.

By November 1985, DTI and RAE discussions noted that Rolls-Royce were seeking American data on ramjet technology to support their work on the engine, which it referred to by the name &quot;Swallow&quot;. Reportedly, the United States Air Force were interested in the technology used in the Swallow engine for its own purposes. In November 1985, discussions between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Minister without portfolio David Young and US President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s scientific advisor George Keyworth noted American interest in collaboration on developing hypersonic vehicles such as HOTOL, and that a prototype could be flying as early as 1990.

According to British government files, neither BAe nor the MoD were enthusiastic for the prospects of American involvement in the programme, expressing reluctance out of a belief that the outcome of such a move could result in the UK becoming a junior member in a project that it once led. There was also a belief that if Britain chose to pair up with the United States, it would find itself frozen out of work on future European launchers. However, Rolls-Royce viewed transatlantic cooperation as necessary. BAe&#x27;s head of future business, Peter Conchie, stated that, if possible, HOTOL should become a part of the European space framework. In early 1986, the British government formally approved the two-year study.

===Problems and criticism===
In December 1984, project management consultant David Andrews issued an eight-page critique of the programme, noting that the design was optimised for the ascent while exposing itself to extended thermal loads during descent due to a low level of drag. He also claimed that the vehicle offered no capability that was not already available; BAe responded that the criticisms made had been answered. In April 1985, the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s research and development department deputy controller James Barnes claimed that HOTOL lacked a justification, and that there was no defence requirement for such vehicles. He also noted that the &quot;engineering problems are considerable&quot; and that it was unlikely to enter service until the 2020s; Barnes also observed the HOTOL engine to be &quot;ingenious&quot;.

In November 1985, the RAE issued an assessment of HOTOL&#x27;s study proposal; the organisation believed that HOTOL would take up to 20 years to develop, rather than the 12-year timetable that had been envisioned by industry. The RAE also projected that the project would have an estimated total cost of £5 billion (as of its value in 1985), £750 million of which would be required in a six-year definition phase and an estimated £25 million in a pre-definition feasibility study.

During development, it was found that the comparatively heavy rear-mounted engine moved the centre of mass of the vehicle rearwards. This meant that the vehicle had to be designed to push the centre of drag as far rearward as possible to ensure stability during the entire flight regime. Redesign of the vehicle to do this required a large mass of hydraulic systems, which cost a significant proportion of the payload, and made the economics unclear. In particular, some of the analysis seemed to indicate that similar technology applied to a pure rocket approach would give approximately the same performance at less cost.

===Shutdown===
By 1989, the outlook for HOTOL had become bleak; from the onset of the project, support between the British government and industrial partners had been uneven, while the United States had emerged as the only foreign nation that showed willingness to contribute to the programme, in part because of the secrecy surrounding it. There was little prospect for European involvement, ESA having elected to pursue development of what would become the Ariane 5, a conventional space launch system. Rolls-Royce withdrew from the project, judging the eventual market for the engine was unlikely to be large enough to repay the development costs. The British government declined to offer further funding for HOTOL. The project was almost at the end of its design phase while much of the plans remained in a speculative state; the craft was reportedly still dogged with aerodynamic problems and operational disadvantages at this point.

===Successors===
A cheaper redesign, Interim HOTOL or HOTOL 2, which was to be launched from the back of a modified Antonov An-225 transport aircraft, specifically was promoted by BAe in 1991; however, this proposal was rejected as well. The design for Interim HOTOL was to have dispensed with an air-breathing engine cycle and was designed to use a more conventional mix of LOX and liquid hydrogen as fuel instead.

In 1989, HOTOL co-creator Alan Bond and engineers John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill formed Reaction Engines Limited (REL) which worked on a new air-breathing engine, SABRE, which used alternative designs to work around (and improve upon) the Rolls-Royce patents, and the Skylon vehicle intended to solve the problems of HOTOL. They first published these engine and spacecraft concepts in 1993, and continued developing the core technologies, particularly the engine and its frost-controlled pre-cooler; initially supported by private funding, but latterly with support from the European Space Agency, the British National Space Centre, the United Kingdom Space Agency, BAe, and the Air Force Research Laboratory. REL planned to demonstrate a flight-ready pre-cooler operating under simulated flight conditions in 2018, and statically test a demonstration engine core in 2020. REL fell into administration in 2024, ceasing all operations. Neither SABRE (a full-scale working engine; partial prototypes and components for testing not counted) nor Skylon were ever built.

==Design==
===Overview===
HOTOL was envisioned as an unmanned, fully reusable single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) winged spaceplane. The unmanned craft was intended to put a payload of around 7 to 8 tonnes in orbit, at 300 km altitude. It was intended to take off from a runway, mounted on the back of a large rocket-boosted trolley that would help get the craft up to &quot;working speed&quot;. The engine was intended to switch from jet propulsion to pure rocket propulsion at 26–32 km high, by which time the craft would be travelling at Mach 5 to 7. After reaching low Earth orbit (LEO), HOTOL was intended to re-enter the atmosphere and glide down to land on a conventional runway (approx 1,500 metres minimum). Only a single payload would have been carried at a time as BAe had judged this to be more economic as it removed any need for satellite interfacing and allowed for missions to be tailored to individual requirements.

During its high-altitude phase, its flight control system would have been linked to ground stations and to space-based global navigation system navigation, while radar would have been used during the take-off and landing phases. In addition to the placing of satellites into geosynchronous orbit or LOE, HOTOL was also projected as being able to also perform the retrieval of satellites and hardware from LOE. BAe promotional material depicts HOTOL docking with the International Space Station (ISS), a feat that the company claimed would have required manned operation as automated systems were not capable of performing such docking manoeuvres at that time. HOTOL was designed to conduct fully automated unmanned flights; however, it had been intended at a later stage to potentially re-introduce a pilot. Manned operations would have required the installation of a dedicated pressurised module within the payload bay.

As designed, HOTOL would have been 62 metres long, 12.8 metres high, a fuselage diameter of 5.7 metres and a wingspan of 19.7 metres. It featured a wing design that had been derived from that of Concorde; its large area resulted in relatively low wing loading, which would have resulted in lower reentry temperatures (never rising above 1,400 °C). Built out of carbon composite materials, there would have been no need for the use of insulating tiles akin to those that comprised the Space Shuttle thermal protection system. The internally stowed landing gear would have been too small to carry the weight of the fully fuelled rocket, so emergency landings would have required the fuel to be dumped.

===Engine===
The RB545, which was given the name &quot;Swallow&quot; by its manufacturer, British engine maker Rolls-Royce, was an air-breathing rocket engine. It would have functioned as an integrated dual-role powerplant, having been capable of air-breathing while operating within the atmosphere and operating in a similar manner to that of a rocket when having attained close to and within LEO. This engine would have also been capable of powering the spacecraft to hypersonic speeds. It was a crucial element of the programme, having been publicly attributed as &quot;the heart of Hotol&#x27;s very low launch costs&quot;.

The exact details of this engine were covered by the Official Secrets Act of the United Kingdom; consequently, there is relatively little public information about its development and on its operation. However, material was later declassified when government policy changed to prevent the keeping of secret patents without an attributed justification.

Within the atmosphere, air would be taken in through two vertically mounted intake ramps, then the flow would be split, passing the correct amount to the pre-coolers, and the excess to spill ducts. Hydrogen from the fuel tanks would be passed through two heat exchangers to pre-cool the air prior to entering a high overall pressure-ratio turbojet-like engine cycle — the heated hydrogen driving a compressor to compress and feed the cooled air into the rocket engine, where it was combusted with some of the hydrogen used to cool the air. The majority of the remaining hot hydrogen was released from the back of the engine, with a small amount drawn off to reheat the air in the spill ducts in a ramjet arrangement to produce &quot;negative intake momentum drag&quot;.

To prevent the pre-coolers from icing up, the first pre-cooler cooled the air to around 10 degrees above freezing point, to liquefy the water vapour in the air. Then liquid oxygen (LOX) would have been injected into the airflow to drop the temperature to flash freezing the water into microscopic ice crystals, sufficiently cold that they wouldn&#x27;t melt due to kinetic heating if they struck the second pre-cooler elements. A water trap could have been added after the first pre-cooler if operating conditions resulted in an excess of moisture.

When it was no longer possible to use the atmosphere for combustion, the RB545 would switch to using on-board LOX to burn with the hydrogen as a high-efficiency hydrogen/oxygen rocket.

<doc id="14306" wikidata="Q208490" url="?curid=14306" title="Hammerhead shark">
<text>The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks that form the family Sphyrnidae, named for the unusual and distinctive form of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a cephalofoil (a T-shape or &quot;hammer&quot;). The shark&#x27;s eyes are placed one on each end of this T-shaped structure, with their small mouths directly centered and underneath. Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus &quot;Sphyrna&quot;, while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, &quot;Eusphyra&quot;. Many different—but not necessarily mutually exclusive—functions have been postulated for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. The cephalofoil gives the shark superior binocular vision and depth perception.

Hammerheads are found worldwide, preferring life in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. Unlike most sharks, some hammerhead species will congregate and swim in large schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night.

==Description==
The known species vary in size, ranging from in length and weighing from 3 to 580 kg (6.6 to 1,300 lb). One specimen caught off the Florida coast in 1906 weighed over . They are usually light gray and have a greenish tint. Their bellies are white, which allows them to blend into the background when viewed from below and sneak up to their prey. Their heads have lateral projections that give them a hammer-like shape. While overall similar, this shape differs somewhat between species; examples are: a distinct T-shape in the great hammerhead, a rounded head with a central notch in the scalloped hammerhead, and an unnotched rounded head in the smooth hammerhead.

Hammerheads have disproportionately small mouths compared to other shark species. Some species are also known to form schools. In the evening, like most other sharks, they become solitary hunters. &quot;National Geographic&quot; explained that hammerheads can be found in warm, tropical waters, but during the summer, they begin a mass migration period in search of colder waters.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

Since sharks do not have mineralized bones and rarely fossilize, only their teeth are commonly found as fossils. Their closest relatives are the requiem sharks (Carcharinidae). Based on DNA studies and fossils, the ancestor of the hammerheads probably lived in the Early Miocene epoch about 20 million years ago.

Using mitochondrial DNA, a phylogenetic tree of the hammerhead sharks showed the winghead shark as sister to the rest of the hammerhead sharks. As the winghead shark has proportionately the largest &quot;hammer&quot; of the hammerhead sharks, this suggests that the first ancestral hammerhead sharks also had large hammers.

The hammer-like shape of the head may have evolved at least in part to enhance the animal&#x27;s vision. The positioning of the eyes, mounted on the sides of the shark&#x27;s distinctive hammer head, allows 360° of vision in the vertical plane, meaning the animals can see above and below them at all times. They also have an increased binocular vision and depth of visual field as a result of the cephalofoil. The shape of the head was previously thought to help the shark find food, aiding in close-quarters maneuverability, and allowing sharp turning movement without losing stability. The unusual structure of its vertebrae, though, has been found to be instrumental in making the turns correctly, more often than the shape of its head, though it would also shift and provide lift. From what is known about the winghead shark, the shape of the hammerhead apparently has to do with an evolved sensory function. Like all sharks, hammerheads have electroreceptory sensory pores called ampullae of Lorenzini. The pores on the shark&#x27;s head lead to sensory tubes, which detect electric fields generated by other living creatures. By distributing the receptors over a wider area, like a larger radio antenna, hammerheads can sweep for prey more effectively.

==Reproduction==
Reproduction occurs only once a year for hammerhead sharks, and usually occurs with the male shark biting the female shark violently until she agrees to mate with him. The hammerhead sharks exhibit a viviparous mode of reproduction with females giving birth to live young. Like other sharks, fertilization is internal, with the male transferring sperm to the female through one of two intromittent organs called claspers. The developing embryos are at first sustained by a yolk sac. When the supply of yolk is exhausted, the depleted yolk sac transforms into a structure analogous to a mammalian placenta (called a &quot;yolk sac placenta&quot; or &quot;pseudoplacenta&quot;), through which the mother delivers sustenance until birth. Once the baby sharks are born, they are not taken care of by the parents in any way. Usually, a litter consists of 12 to 15 pups, except for the great hammerhead, which gives birth to litters of 20 to 40 pups. These baby sharks huddle together and swim toward warmer water until they are old and large enough to survive on their own.

In 2007, the bonnethead shark was found to be capable of asexual reproduction via automictic parthenogenesis, in which a female&#x27;s ovum fuses with a polar body to form a zygote without the need for a male. This was the first shark known to do this.

==Diet==
Hammerhead sharks eat a large range of prey such as fish (including other sharks), squid, octopus, and crustaceans. Stingrays are a particular favorite, with the positioning of their (comparatively) smaller, crescent-shaped mouths underneath their T-shaped heads allowing for skilled skate, ray, and flounder hunting, among other seafloor-dwellers. These sharks will often be found swimming above the sand along the bottom of the ocean, stalking their prey. Their unique heads are further utilized as a tool (or weapon) if hunting rays and flatfishes; the shark uses its head to pin down and briefly stun the prey, and only eats once their quarry is clearly weakened and in shock. The great hammerhead, tending to be larger and more aggressive to its own kind than other hammerheads, occasionally engages in cannibalism, eating other hammerhead sharks, including mothers consuming their own young. In addition to the typical animal prey, bonnetheads have been found to feed on seagrass, which sometimes makes up as much as half their stomach contents. They may swallow it unintentionally, but they are able to partially digest it. At the time of discovery, this was the only known case of a potentially omnivorous species of shark (since then, whale sharks were also found to be omnivorous).

== Species ==
There are ten distinct species of Hammerhead shark in the wild:

==Relationship with humans==
According to the International Shark Attack File, humans have been subjects of 17 documented, unprovoked attacks by hammerhead sharks within the genus &quot;Sphyrna&quot; since AD 1580. No human fatalities have been recorded. Most hammerhead shark species are too small to inflict serious damage to humans.

The great and the scalloped hammerheads are listed on the World Conservation Union&#x27;s (IUCN) 2008 Red List as endangered, whereas the smalleye hammerhead is listed as vulnerable. The status given to these sharks is as a result of overfishing and demand for their fins, an expensive delicacy. Among others, scientists expressed their concern about the plight of the scalloped hammerhead at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Boston. The young swim mostly in shallow waters along shores all over the world to avoid predators.

Shark fins are prized as a delicacy in certain countries in Asia (such as China), and overfishing is putting many hammerhead sharks at risk of extinction. Fishermen who harvest the animals typically cut off the fins and toss the remainder of the fish, which is often still alive, back into the sea. This practice, known as finning, is lethal to the shark.

=== In captivity ===
The relatively small bonnethead is regular at public aquariums, as it has proven easier to keep in captivity than the larger hammerhead species, and it has been bred at a handful of facilities. Nevertheless, at up to in length and with highly specialized requirements, very few private aquarists have the experience and resources necessary to maintain a bonnethead in captivity. The larger hammerhead species can reach more than twice that size and are considered difficult, even compared to most other similar-sized sharks (such as &quot;Carcharhinus&quot; species, lemon shark, and sand tiger shark) regularly kept by public aquariums. They are particularly vulnerable during transport between facilities, may rub on surfaces in tanks, and may collide with rocks, causing injuries to their heads, so they require very large, specially adapted tanks. As a consequence, relatively few public aquaria have kept them for long periods. The scalloped hammerhead is the most frequently maintained large species, and it has been kept long term at public aquaria in most continents, but primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia. In 2014, fewer than 15 public aquaria in the world kept scalloped hammerheads. Great hammerheads have been kept at a few facilities in North America, including Atlantis Paradise Island Resort (Bahamas), Adventure Aquarium (New Jersey), Georgia Aquarium (Atlanta), Mote Marine Laboratory (Florida), and the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay (Las Vegas). Smooth hammerheads have also been kept in the past.

==Protection==

Humans are the main threat to hammerhead sharks. Although they are not usually the primary target, hammerhead sharks are caught in fisheries all over the world. Tropical fisheries are the most common place for hammerheads to be caught because of their preference to reside in warm waters. The total number of hammerheads caught in fisheries is recorded in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Global Capture Production dataset. The number steadily increased from 75 metric tons in 1990, to 6,313 metric tons by 2010.

Shark fin traders say that hammerheads have some of the best quality fin needles which makes them good to eat when prepared properly. Hong Kong is the world&#x27;s largest fin trade market and accounts for about 1.5% of the total annual amount of fins traded. It is estimated that around 375,000 great hammerhead sharks alone are traded per year which is equivalent to 21,000 metric tons of biomass. However, most sharks that are caught are only used for their fins and then discarded. The meat of hammerheads is generally unwanted. Consumption of hammerhead meat has been recorded in Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Kenya and Japan.

In March 2013, three endangered, commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip, and porbeagle, were added to Appendix II of CITES, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.

==Cultural significance==
Among Torres Strait Islanders, the hammerhead shark, known as the &quot;beizam&quot;, is a common family totem and often represented in cultural artefacts such as the elaborate headdresses worn for ceremonial dances, known as dhari (dari). They are associated with law and order. Renowned artist Ken Thaiday Snr is known for his representations of&quot; beizam&quot; in his sculptural &quot;dari&quot; and other works.

In native Hawaiian culture, sharks are considered to be gods of the sea, protectors of humans, and cleaners of excessive ocean life. Some of these sharks are believed to be family members who died and have been reincarnated into shark form, but others are considered man-eaters, also known as &quot;niuhi&quot;. These sharks include great white sharks, tiger sharks, and bull sharks. The hammerhead shark, also known as &quot;mano kihikihi&quot;, is not considered a man-eater or &quot;niuhi&quot;; it is considered to be one of the most respected sharks of the ocean, an &quot;aumakua&quot;. Many Hawaiian families believe that they have an &quot;aumakua&quot; watching over them and protecting them from the &quot;niuhi&quot;. The hammerhead shark is thought to be the birth animal of some children. Hawaiian children who are born with the hammerhead shark as an animal sign are believed to be warriors and are meant to sail the oceans. Hammerhead sharks rarely pass through the waters of Maui, but many Maui natives believe that their swimming by is a sign that the gods are watching over the families, and the oceans are clean and balanced.

<doc id="14307" wikidata="Q10656" url="?curid=14307" title="Hall effect">
<text>The Hall effect is the production of a potential difference (the Hall voltage) across an electrical conductor that is to an electric current in the conductor and to an applied magnetic field to the current. It was discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.

The &quot;Hall coefficient&quot; is defined as the ratio of the induced electric field to the product of the current density and the applied magnetic field. It is a characteristic of the material from which the conductor is made, since its value depends on the type, number, and properties of the charge carriers that constitute the current.

==Discovery==

Wires carrying current in a magnetic field experience a mechanical force perpendicular to both the current and magnetic field. 

In the 1820s, André-Marie Ampère observed this underlying mechanism that led to the discovery of the Hall effect. However it was not until a solid mathematical basis for electromagnetism was systematized by James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot; (published in 1861–1862) that details of the interaction between magnets and electric current could be understood.

Edwin Hall then explored the question of whether magnetic fields interacted with the conductors &quot;or&quot; the electric current, and reasoned that if the force was specifically acting on the current, it should crowd current to one side of the wire, producing a small measurable voltage. In 1879, he discovered this &quot;Hall effect&quot; while he was working on his doctoral degree at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Eighteen years before the electron was discovered, his measurements of the tiny effect produced in the apparatus he used were an experimental , published under the name &quot;On a New Action of the Magnet on Electric Currents&quot;.

==Theory==
The Hall effect is due to the nature of the current in a conductor. Current consists of the movement of many small charge carriers, typically electrons, holes, ions (see Electromigration) or all three. When a magnetic field is present, these charges experience a force, called the Lorentz force. When such a magnetic field is absent, the charges follow approximately straight paths between collisions with impurities, phonons, etc. However, when a magnetic field with a perpendicular component is applied, their paths between collisions are curved; thus, moving charges accumulate on one face of the material. This leaves equal and opposite charges exposed on the other face, where there is a scarcity of mobile charges. The result is an asymmetric distribution of charge density across the Hall element, arising from a force that is perpendicular to both the straight path and the applied magnetic field. The separation of charge establishes an electric field that opposes the migration of further charge, so a steady electric potential is established for as long as the charge is flowing.

In classical electromagnetism electrons move in the opposite direction of the current (by convention &quot;current&quot; describes a theoretical &quot;hole flow&quot;). In some metals and semiconductors it &quot;appears&quot; &quot;holes&quot; are actually flowing because the direction of the voltage is opposite to the derivation below.

For a simple metal where there is only one type of charge carrier (electrons), the Hall voltage can be derived by using the Lorentz force and seeing that, in the steady-state condition, charges are not moving in the -axis direction. Thus, the magnetic force on each electron in the -axis direction is cancelled by a -axis electrical force due to the buildup of charges. The term is the drift velocity of the current which is assumed at this point to be holes by convention. The term is negative in the -axis direction by the right hand rule.

formula_1

In steady state, , so , where is assigned in the direction of the -axis, (and not with the arrow of the induced electric field as in the image (pointing in the direction), which tells you where the field caused by the electrons is pointing).

In wires, electrons instead of holes are flowing, so and . Also . Substituting these changes gives

formula_2

The conventional &quot;hole&quot; current is in the negative direction of the electron current and the negative of the electrical charge which gives where is charge carrier density, is the cross-sectional area, and is the charge of each electron. Solving for formula_3 and plugging into the above gives the Hall voltage:

formula_4

If the charge build up had been positive (as it appears in some metals and semiconductors), then the assigned in the image would have been negative (positive charge would have built up on the left side).

The Hall coefficient is defined as
formula_5
or
formula_6
where is the current density of the carrier electrons, and is the induced electric field. In SI units, this becomes
formula_7

(The units of are usually expressed as m3/C, or Ω·cm/G, or other variants.) As a result, the Hall effect is very useful as a means to measure either the carrier density or the magnetic field.

One very important feature of the Hall effect is that it differentiates between positive charges moving in one direction and negative charges moving in the opposite. In the diagram above, the Hall effect with a negative charge carrier (the electron) is presented. But consider the same magnetic field and current are applied but the current is carried inside the Hall effect device by a positive particle. The particle would of course have to be moving in the opposite direction of the electron in order for the current to be the same—down in the diagram, not up like the electron is. And thus, mnemonically speaking, your thumb in the Lorentz force law, representing (conventional) current, would be pointing the &quot;same&quot; direction as before, because current is the same—an electron moving up is the same current as a positive charge moving down. And with the fingers (magnetic field) also being the same, interestingly &quot;the charge carrier gets deflected to the left in the diagram regardless of whether it is positive or negative.&quot; But if positive carriers are deflected to the left, they would build a relatively &quot;positive voltage&quot; on the left whereas if negative carriers (namely electrons) are, they build up a negative voltage on the left as shown in the diagram. Thus for the same current and magnetic field, the electric polarity of the Hall voltage is dependent on the internal nature of the conductor and is useful to elucidate its inner workings.

This property of the Hall effect offered the first real proof that electric currents in most metals are carried by moving electrons, not by protons. It also showed that in some substances (especially p-type semiconductors), it is contrarily more appropriate to think of the current as positive &quot;holes&quot; moving rather than negative electrons. A common source of confusion with the Hall effect in such materials is that holes moving one way are really electrons moving the opposite way, so one expects the Hall voltage polarity to be the same as if electrons were the charge carriers as in most metals and n-type semiconductors. Yet we observe the opposite polarity of Hall voltage, indicating positive charge carriers. However, of course there are no actual positrons or other positive elementary particles carrying the charge in p-type semiconductors, hence the name &quot;holes&quot;. In the same way as the oversimplistic picture of light in glass as photons being absorbed and re-emitted to explain refraction breaks down upon closer scrutiny, this apparent contradiction too can only be resolved by the modern quantum mechanical theory of quasiparticles wherein the collective quantized motion of multiple particles can, in a real physical sense, be considered to be a particle in its own right (albeit not an elementary one).

Unrelatedly, inhomogeneity in the conductive sample can result in a spurious sign of the Hall effect, even in ideal van der Pauw configuration of electrodes. For example, a Hall effect consistent with positive carriers was observed in evidently n-type semiconductors. Another source of artefact, in uniform materials, occurs when the sample&#x27;s aspect ratio is not long enough: the full Hall voltage only develops far away from the current-introducing contacts, since at the contacts the transverse voltage is shorted out to zero.

===Hall effect in semiconductors===
When a current-carrying semiconductor is kept in a magnetic field, the charge carriers of the semiconductor experience a force in a direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current. At equilibrium, a voltage appears at the semiconductor edges.

The simple formula for the Hall coefficient given above is usually a good explanation when conduction is dominated by a single charge carrier. However, in semiconductors and many metals the theory is more complex, because in these materials conduction can involve significant, simultaneous contributions from both electrons and holes, which may be present in different concentrations and have different mobilities. For moderate magnetic fields the Hall coefficient is

formula_8
or equivalently
formula_9
with
formula_10
Here is the electron concentration, the hole concentration, the electron mobility, the hole mobility and the elementary charge.

For large applied fields the simpler expression analogous to that for a single carrier type holds.

===Relationship with star formation===
Although it is well known that magnetic fields play an important role in star formation, research models indicate that Hall diffusion critically influences the dynamics of gravitational collapse that forms protostars.

===Quantum Hall effect===

For a two-dimensional electron system which can be produced in a MOSFET, in the presence of large magnetic field strength and low temperature, one can observe the quantum Hall effect, in which the Hall conductance undergoes quantum Hall transitions to take on quantized values.

===Spin Hall effect===

The spin Hall effect consists in the spin accumulation on the lateral boundaries of a current-carrying sample. No magnetic field is needed. It was predicted by Mikhail Dyakonov and V. I. Perel in 1971 and observed experimentally more than 30 years later, both in semiconductors and in metals, at cryogenic as well as at room temperatures.

The quantity describing the strength of the Spin Hall effect is known as Spin Hall angle, and it is defined as:

formula_11

Where formula_12 is the spin current generated by the applied current density formula_13.

===Quantum spin Hall effect===

For mercury telluride two dimensional quantum wells with strong spin-orbit coupling, in zero magnetic field, at low temperature, the quantum spin Hall effect has been observed in 2007.

===Anomalous Hall effect===
In ferromagnetic materials (and paramagnetic materials in a magnetic field), the Hall resistivity includes an additional contribution, known as the anomalous Hall effect (or the extraordinary Hall effect), which depends directly on the magnetization of the material, and is often much larger than the ordinary Hall effect. (Note that this effect is &quot;not&quot; due to the contribution of the magnetization to the total magnetic field.) For example, in nickel, the anomalous Hall coefficient is about 100 times larger than the ordinary Hall coefficient near the Curie temperature, but the two are similar at very low temperatures. Although a well-recognized phenomenon, there is still debate about its origins in the various materials. The anomalous Hall effect can be either an &quot;extrinsic&quot; (disorder-related) effect due to spin-dependent scattering of the charge carriers, or an &quot;intrinsic&quot; effect which can be described in terms of the Berry phase effect in the crystal momentum space (-space).

=== Hall effect in ionized gases ===
The Hall effect in an ionized gas (plasma) is significantly different from the Hall effect in solids (where the Hall parameter is always much less than unity). In a plasma, the Hall parameter can take any value. The Hall parameter, , in a plasma is the ratio between the electron gyrofrequency, , and the electron-heavy particle collision frequency, :
formula_14
where
* is the elementary charge (approximately )
* is the magnetic field (in teslas)
* is the electron mass (approximately ).

The Hall parameter value increases with the magnetic field strength.

Physically, the trajectories of electrons are curved by the Lorentz force. Nevertheless, when the Hall parameter is low, their motion between two encounters with heavy particles (neutral or ion) is almost linear. But if the Hall parameter is high, the electron movements are highly curved. The current density vector, , is no longer collinear with the electric field vector, . The two vectors and make the Hall angle, , which also gives the Hall parameter:
formula_15

=== Other Hall effects ===
The Hall Effects family has expanded to encompass other quasi-particles in semiconductor nanostructures. Specifically, a set of Hall Effects has emerged based on excitons and exciton-polaritons in 2D materials and quantum wells.

== Applications ==

Hall sensors amplify and use the Hall effect for a variety of sensing applications.

==Corbino effect==
The Corbino effect, named after its discoverer Orso Mario Corbino, is a phenomenon involving the Hall effect, but a disc-shaped metal sample is used in place of a rectangular one. Because of its shape the Corbino disc allows the observation of Hall effect–based magnetoresistance without the associated Hall voltage.

A radial current through a circular disc, subjected to a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the disc, produces a &quot;circular&quot; current through the disc. The absence of the free transverse boundaries renders the interpretation of the Corbino effect simpler than that of the Hall effect.

<doc id="14308" wikidata="Q172822" url="?curid=14308" title="Hoover Dam">
<text>Hoover Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, on the border between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. Constructed between 1931 and 1936, during the Great Depression, it was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over 100 lives. Bills passed by Congress during its construction referred to it as Hoover Dam (after President Herbert Hoover), but the Roosevelt administration named it Boulder Dam. In 1947, Congress restored the name Hoover Dam.

Since about 1900, the Black Canyon and nearby Boulder Canyon had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water, and produce hydroelectric power. In 1928, Congress authorized the project. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium named Six Companies, Inc., which began construction in early 1931. Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, and some of the techniques used were unproven. The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned the dam over to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.

Hoover Dam impounds Lake Mead and is located near Boulder City, Nevada, a municipality originally constructed for workers on the construction project, about southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. The dam&#x27;s generators provide power for public and private utilities in Nevada, Arizona, and California. Hoover Dam is a major tourist attraction, with 7 million tourists a year. The heavily traveled U.S. Route 93 (US 93) ran along the dam&#x27;s crest until October 2010, when the Hoover Dam Bypass opened.

== Background ==
=== Search for resources ===

As the United States developed the Southwest, the Colorado River was seen as a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the Alamo Canal just north of the Mexican border; the canal dipped into Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the Imperial Valley. Though water from the Alamo Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to operate. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the Salton Sea, the Southern Pacific Railroad spent $3 million in 1906–07 to stabilize the waterway, an amount it hoped in vain that it would be reimbursed for by the federal government. Even after the waterway was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border.

As the technology of electric power transmission improved, the Lower Colorado was considered for its hydroelectric-power potential. In 1902, the Edison Electric Company of Los Angeles surveyed the river in the hope of building a rock dam which could generate . However, at the time, the limit of transmission of electric power was , and there were few customers (mostly mines) within that limit. Edison allowed land options it held on the river to lapse—including an option for what became the site of Hoover Dam.

In the following years, the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), known as the Reclamation Service at the time, also considered the Lower Colorado as the site for a dam. Service chief Arthur Powell Davis proposed using dynamite to collapse the walls of Boulder Canyon, north of the eventual dam site, into the river. The river would carry off the smaller pieces of debris, and a dam would be built incorporating the remaining rubble. In 1922, after considering it for several years, the Reclamation Service finally rejected the proposal, citing doubts about the unproven technique and questions as to whether it would, in fact, save money.

=== Planning and agreements ===

In 1922, the Reclamation Service presented a report calling for the development of a dam on the Colorado River for flood control and electric power generation. The report was principally authored by Davis and was called the Fall-Davis report after Interior Secretary Albert Fall. The Fall-Davis report cited use of the Colorado River as a federal concern because the river&#x27;s basin covered several states, and the river eventually entered Mexico. Though the Fall-Davis report called for a dam &quot;at or near Boulder Canyon&quot;, the Reclamation Service (which was renamed the Bureau of Reclamation the following year) found that canyon unsuitable. One potential site at Boulder Canyon was bisected by a geologic fault; two others were so narrow there was no space for a construction camp at the bottom of the canyon or for a spillway. The Service investigated Black Canyon and found it ideal; a railway could be laid from the railhead in Las Vegas to the top of the dam site. Despite the site change, the dam project was referred to as the &quot;Boulder Canyon Project&quot;.

With little guidance on water allocation from the Supreme Court, proponents of the dam feared endless litigation. Delph Carpenter, a Colorado attorney, proposed that the seven states which fell within the river&#x27;s basin (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming) form an interstate compact, with the approval of Congress. Such compacts were authorized by Article I of the United States Constitution but had never been concluded among more than two states. In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the &quot;Wyoming v. Colorado&quot; decision undermining the claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement. The resulting Colorado River Compact was signed on November 24, 1922.

Legislation to authorize the dam was introduced repeatedly by two California Republicans, Representative Phil Swing and Senator Hiram Johnson, but representatives from other parts of the country considered the project as hugely expensive and one that would mostly benefit California. The 1927 Mississippi flood made Midwestern and Southern congressmen and senators more sympathetic toward the dam project. On March 12, 1928, the failure of the St. Francis Dam, constructed by the city of Los Angeles, caused a disastrous flood that killed up to 600 people. As that dam was a curved-gravity type, similar in design to the arch-gravity as was proposed for the Black Canyon dam, opponents claimed that the Black Canyon dam&#x27;s safety could not be guaranteed. Congress authorized a board of engineers to review plans for the proposed dam. The Colorado River Board found the project feasible, but warned that should the dam fail, every downstream Colorado River community would be destroyed, and that the river might change course and empty into the Salton Sea. The Board cautioned: &quot;To avoid such possibilities, the proposed dam should be constructed on conservative if not ultra-conservative lines.&quot;

On December 21, 1928, President Coolidge signed the bill authorizing the dam. The Boulder Canyon Project Act appropriated $165 million for the project along with the downstream Imperial Dam and All-American Canal, a replacement for Beatty&#x27;s canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border. It also permitted the compact to go into effect when at least six of the seven states approved it. This occurred on March 6, 1929, with Utah&#x27;s ratification; Arizona did not approve it until 1944.

=== Design, preparation and contracting ===

Even before Congress approved the Boulder Canyon Project, the Bureau of Reclamation was considering what kind of dam should be used. Officials eventually decided on a massive concrete arch-gravity dam, the design of which was overseen by the Bureau&#x27;s chief design engineer John L. Savage. The monolithic dam would be thick at the bottom and thin near the top and would present a convex face towards the water above the dam. The curving arch of the dam would transmit the water&#x27;s force into the abutments, in this case the rock walls of the canyon. The wedge-shaped dam would be thick at the bottom, narrowing to at the top, leaving room for a highway connecting Nevada and Arizona.

On January 10, 1931, the Bureau made the bid documents available to interested parties, at five dollars a copy. The government was to provide the materials, and the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam. The dam was described in minute detail, covering 100 pages of text and 76 drawings. A $2 million bid bond was to accompany each bid; the winner would have to post a $5 million performance bond. The contractor had seven years to build the dam, or penalties would ensue.

The Wattis Brothers, heads of the Utah Construction Company, were interested in bidding on the project, but lacked the money for the performance bond. They lacked sufficient resources even in combination with their longtime partners, Morrison-Knudsen, which employed the nation&#x27;s leading dam builder, Frank Crowe. They formed a joint venture to bid for the project with Pacific Bridge Company of Portland, Oregon; Henry J. Kaiser &amp; W. A. Bechtel Company of San Francisco; MacDonald &amp; Kahn Ltd. of Los Angeles; and the J.F. Shea Company of Portland, Oregon. The joint venture was called Six Companies, Inc. as Bechtel and Kaiser were considered one company for purposes of Six in the name. The name was descriptive and was an inside joke among the San Franciscans in the bid, where &quot;Six Companies&quot; was also a Chinese benevolent association in the city. There were three valid bids, and Six Companies&#x27; bid of $48,890,955 was the lowest, within $24,000 of the confidential government estimate of what the dam would cost to build, and five million dollars less than the next-lowest bid.

The city of Las Vegas had lobbied hard to be the headquarters for the dam construction, closing its many speakeasies when the decision maker, Secretary of the Interior Ray Wilbur, came to town. Instead, Wilbur announced in early 1930 that a model city was to be built in the desert near the dam site. This town became known as Boulder City, Nevada. Construction of a rail line joining Las Vegas and the dam site began in September 1930.

== Construction ==

=== Labor force ===

Soon after the dam was authorized, increasing numbers of unemployed people converged on southern Nevada. Las Vegas, then a small city of some 5,000, saw between 10,000 and 20,000 unemployed descend on it. A government camp was established for surveyors and other personnel near the dam site; this soon became surrounded by a squatters&#x27; camp. Known as McKeeversville, the camp was home to men hoping for work on the project, together with their families. Another camp, on the flats along the Colorado River, was officially called Williamsville, but was known to its inhabitants as &quot;Ragtown&quot;. When construction began, Six Companies hired large numbers of workers, with more than 3,000 on the payroll by 1932 and with employment peaking at 5,251 in July 1934. &quot;Mongolian&quot; (Chinese) labor was prevented by the construction contract, while the number of black people employed by Six Companies never exceeded thirty, mostly lowest-pay-scale laborers in a segregated crew, who were issued separate water buckets.

As part of the contract, Six Companies, Inc. was to build Boulder City to house the workers. The original timetable called for Boulder City to be built before the dam project began, but President Hoover ordered work on the dam to begin in March 1931 rather than in October. The company built bunkhouses, attached to the canyon wall, to house 480 single men at what became known as River Camp. Workers with families were left to provide their own accommodations until Boulder City could be completed, and many lived in Ragtown. The site of Hoover Dam endures extremely hot weather, and the summer of 1931 was especially torrid, with the daytime high averaging . Sixteen workers and other riverbank residents died of heat prostration between June 25 and July 26, 1931.

The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or &quot;Wobblies&quot;), though much-reduced from their heyday as militant labor organizers in the early years of the century, hoped to unionize the Six Companies workers by capitalizing on their discontent. They sent eleven organizers, several of whom were arrested by Las Vegas police. On August 7, 1931, the company cut wages for all tunnel workers. Although the workers sent the organizers away, not wanting to be associated with the &quot;Wobblies&quot;, they formed a committee to represent them with the company. The committee drew up a list of demands that evening and presented them to Crowe the following morning. He was noncommittal. The workers hoped that Crowe, the general superintendent of the job, would be sympathetic; instead, he gave a scathing interview to a newspaper, describing the workers as &quot;malcontents&quot;.

On the morning of the 9th, Crowe met with the committee and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5 p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments. Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off. While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.

A second labor action took place in July 1935, as construction on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike. Emboldened by Crowe&#x27;s reversal of the lunch decree, workers raised their demands to include a $1-per-day raise. The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but no money was forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.

=== River diversion ===

Before the dam could be built, the Colorado River needed to be diverted away from the construction site. To accomplish this, four diversion tunnels were driven through the canyon walls, two on the Nevada side and two on the Arizona side. These tunnels were in diameter. Their combined length was nearly 16,000 ft, or more than . The contract required these tunnels to be completed by October 1, 1933, with a $3,000-per-day fine to be assessed for any delay. To meet the deadline, Six Companies had to complete work by early 1933, since only in late fall and winter was the water level in the river low enough to safely divert.

Tunneling began at the lower portals of the Nevada tunnels in May 1931. Shortly afterward, work began on two similar tunnels in the Arizona canyon wall. In March 1932, work began on lining the tunnels with concrete. First the base, or invert, was poured. Gantry cranes, running on rails through the entire length of each tunnel were used to place the concrete. The sidewalls were poured next. Movable sections of steel forms were used for the sidewalls. Finally, using pneumatic guns, the overheads were filled in. The concrete lining is thick, reducing the finished tunnel diameter to . The river was diverted into the two Arizona tunnels on November 13, 1932; the Nevada tunnels were kept in reserve for high water. This was done by exploding a temporary cofferdam protecting the Arizona tunnels while at the same time dumping rubble into the river until its natural course was blocked.

Following the completion of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels&#x27; outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.

=== Groundworks, rock clearance and grout curtain ===
To protect the construction site from the Colorado River and to facilitate the river&#x27;s diversion, two cofferdams were constructed. Work on the upper cofferdam began in September 1932, even though the river had not yet been diverted. The cofferdams were designed to protect against the possibility of the river&#x27;s flooding a site at which two thousand men might be at work, and their specifications were covered in the bid documents in nearly as much detail as the dam itself. The upper cofferdam was high, and thick at its base, thicker than the dam itself. It contained of material.

When the cofferdams were in place and the construction site was drained of water, excavation for the dam foundation began. For the dam to rest on solid rock, it was necessary to remove accumulated erosion soils and other loose materials in the riverbed until sound bedrock was reached. Work on the foundation excavations was completed in June 1933. During this excavation, approximately of material was removed. Since the dam was an arch-gravity type, the side-walls of the canyon would bear the force of the impounded lake. Therefore, the side-walls were also excavated to reach virgin rock, as weathered rock might provide pathways for water seepage. Shovels for the excavation came from the Marion Power Shovel Company.

The men who removed this rock were called &quot;high scalers&quot;. While suspended from the top of the canyon with ropes, the high-scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with jackhammers and dynamite. Falling objects were the most common cause of death on the dam site; the high scalers&#x27; work thus helped ensure worker safety. One high scaler was able to save a life in a more direct manner: when a government inspector lost his grip on a safety line and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death, a high scaler was able to intercept him and pull him into the air. The construction site had become a magnet for tourists. The high scalers were prime attractions and showed off for the watchers. The high scalers received considerable media attention, with one worker dubbed the &quot;Human Pendulum&quot; for swinging co-workers (and, at other times, cases of dynamite) across the canyon. To protect themselves against falling objects, some high scalers dipped cloth hats in tar and allowed them to harden. When workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws, they sustained no skull damage. Six Companies ordered thousands of what initially were called &quot;hard boiled hats&quot; (later &quot;hard hats&quot;) and strongly encouraged their use.

The cleared, underlying rock foundation of the dam site was reinforced with grout, forming a grout curtain. Holes were driven into the walls and base of the canyon, as deep as into the rock, and any cavities encountered were to be filled with grout. This was done to stabilize the rock, to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock, and to limit &quot;uplift&quot;—upward pressure from water seeping under the dam. The workers were under severe time constraints due to the beginning of the concrete pour. When they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill, they moved on without resolving the problem. A total of 58 of the 393 holes were incompletely filled. After the dam was completed and the lake began to fill, large numbers of significant leaks caused the Bureau of Reclamation to examine the situation. It found that the work had been incompletely done, and was based on less than a full understanding of the canyon&#x27;s geology. New holes were drilled from inspection galleries inside the dam into the surrounding bedrock. It took nine years (1938–47) under relative secrecy to complete the supplemental grout curtain.

=== Concrete ===

The first concrete was poured into the dam on June 6, 1933, 18 months ahead of schedule. Since concrete heats and contracts as it cures, the potential for uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete posed a serious problem. Bureau of Reclamation engineers calculated that if the dam were to be built in a single continuous pour, the concrete would take 125 years to cool, and the resulting stresses would cause the dam to crack and crumble. Instead, the ground where the dam would rise was marked with rectangles, and concrete blocks in columns were poured, some as large as and high. Each five-foot form contained a set of steel pipes; cool river water would be poured through the pipes, followed by ice-cold water from a refrigeration plant. When an individual block had cured and had stopped contracting, the pipes were filled with grout. Grout was also used to fill the hairline spaces between columns, which were grooved to increase the strength of the joints.

The concrete was delivered in huge steel buckets and almost 7 feet in diameter; Crowe was awarded two patents for their design. These buckets, which weighed when full, were filled at two massive concrete plants on the Nevada side, and were delivered to the site in special railcars. The buckets were then suspended from aerial cableways which were used to deliver the bucket to a specific column. As the required grade of aggregate in the concrete differed depending on placement in the dam (from pea-sized gravel to stones), it was vital that the bucket be maneuvered to the proper column. When the bottom of the bucket opened up, disgorging of concrete, a team of men worked it throughout the form. Although there are myths that men were caught in the pour and are entombed in the dam to this day, each bucket deepened the concrete in a form by only , and Six Companies engineers would not have permitted a flaw caused by the presence of a human body.

A total of of concrete was used in the dam before concrete pouring ceased on May 29, 1935. In addition, were used in the power plant and other works. More than of cooling pipes were placed within the concrete. Overall, there is enough concrete in the dam to pave a two-lane highway from San Francisco to New York. Concrete cores were removed from the dam for testing in 1995; they showed that &quot;Hoover Dam&#x27;s concrete has continued to slowly gain strength&quot; and the dam is composed of a &quot;durable concrete having a compressive strength exceeding the range typically found in normal mass concrete&quot;. Hoover Dam concrete is not subject to alkali–silica reaction (ASR), as the Hoover Dam builders happened to use nonreactive aggregate, unlike that at downstream Parker Dam, where ASR has caused measurable deterioration.

=== Dedication and completion ===

With most work finished on the dam itself (the powerhouse remained uncompleted), a formal dedication ceremony was arranged for September 30, 1935, to coincide with a western tour being made by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The morning of the dedication, it was moved forward three hours from 2 p.m. Pacific time to 11 a.m.; this was done because Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes had reserved a radio slot for the President for 2 p.m. but officials did not realize until the day of the ceremony that the slot was for 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Despite the change in the ceremony time, and temperatures of , 10,000 people were present for the President&#x27;s speech, in which he avoided mentioning the name of former President Hoover, who was not invited to the ceremony. To mark the occasion, a three-cent stamp was issued by the United States Post Office Department—bearing the name &quot;Boulder Dam&quot;, the official name of the dam between 1933 and 1947. After the ceremony, Roosevelt made the first visit by any American president to Las Vegas.

Most work had been completed by the dedication, and Six Companies negotiated with the government through late 1935 and early 1936 to settle all claims and arrange for the formal transfer of the dam to the Federal Government. The parties came to an agreement and on March 1, 1936, Secretary Ickes formally accepted the dam on behalf of the government. Six Companies was not required to complete work on one item, a concrete plug for one of the bypass tunnels, as the tunnel had to be used to take in irrigation water until the powerhouse went into operation.

=== Construction deaths ===
There were 112 deaths reported as associated with the construction of the dam. The first was Bureau of Reclamation employee Harold Connelly who died on May 15, 1921, after falling from a barge while surveying the Colorado River for an ideal spot for the dam. Surveyor John Gregory (&quot;J.G.&quot;) Tierney, who drowned on December 20, 1922, in a flash flood while looking for an ideal spot for the dam was the second person. The official list&#x27;s final death occurred on December 20, 1935, when Patrick Tierney, electrician&#x27;s helper and the son of J.G. Tierney, fell from one of the two Arizona-side intake towers. Included in the fatality list are three workers who took their own lives on site, one in 1932 and two in 1933. Of the 112 fatalities, 91 were Six Companies employees, three were Bureau of Reclamation employees, and one was a visitor to the site; the remainder were employees of various contractors not part of Six Companies.

Ninety-six of the deaths occurred during construction at the site. Not included in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning (brought on by the use of gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims. The site&#x27;s diversion tunnels frequently reached , enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases. A total of 42 workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia and were not included in the above total; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.

=== Architectural style ===
The initial plans for the facade of the dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and ornaments clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam&#x27;s functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors. Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculpted turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona—both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe daylight saving time, the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.


At Kaufmann&#x27;s request, Denver artist Allen Tupper True was hired to handle the design and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam. True&#x27;s design scheme incorporated motifs of the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of the region. Although some were initially opposed to these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist. With the assistance of the National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles, baskets and ceramics. The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animals—lizards, serpents, birds—and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas. In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True also reflected on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.

With the agreement of Kaufmann and the engineers, True also devised for the pipes and machinery an innovative color-coding which was implemented throughout all BOR projects. True&#x27;s consulting artist job lasted through 1942; it was extended so he could complete design work for the Parker, Shasta and Grand Coulee dams and power plants. True&#x27;s work on the Hoover Dam was humorously referred to in a poem published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, part of which read, &quot;lose the spark, and justify the dream; but also worthy of remark will be the color scheme&quot;.

Complementing Kaufmann and True&#x27;s work, sculptor Oskar J. W. Hansen designed many of the sculptures on and around the dam. His works include the monument of dedication plaza, a plaque to memorialize the workers killed and the bas-reliefs on the elevator towers. In his words, Hansen wanted his work to express &quot;the immutable calm of intellectual resolution, and the enormous power of trained physical strength, equally enthroned in placid triumph of scientific accomplishment&quot;, because &quot;[t]he building of Hoover Dam belongs to the sagas of the daring.&quot; Hansen&#x27;s dedication plaza, on the Nevada abutment, contains a sculpture of two winged figures flanking a flagpole.
Surrounding the base of the monument is a terrazzo floor embedded with a &quot;star map&quot;. The map depicts the Northern Hemisphere sky at the moment of President Roosevelt&#x27;s dedication of the dam. This is intended to help future astronomers, if necessary, calculate the exact date of dedication. The bronze figures, dubbed &quot;Winged Figures of the Republic&quot;, were both formed in a continuous pour. To put such large bronzes into place without marring the highly polished bronze surface, they were placed on ice and guided into position as the ice melted. Hansen&#x27;s bas-relief on the Nevada elevator tower depicts the benefits of the dam: flood control, navigation, irrigation, water storage, and power. The bas-relief on the Arizona elevator depicts, in his words, &quot;the visages of those Indian tribes who have inhabited mountains and plains from ages distant.&quot;

== Operation ==
=== Power plant and water demands ===

Excavation for the powerhouse was carried out simultaneously with the excavation for the dam foundation and abutments. The excavation of this U-shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933. Filling of Lake Mead began February 1, 1935, even before the last of the concrete was poured that May. The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted at the time of the formal dedication on September 30, 1935; a crew of 500 men remained to finish it and other structures. To make the powerhouse roof bombproof, it was constructed of layers of concrete, rock, and steel with a total thickness of about , topped with layers of sand and tar.

In the latter half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three Allis Chalmers built Francis turbine-generators, all on the Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada generator went online and the first Arizona generator by August. By September 1939, four more generators were operating, and the dam&#x27;s power plant became the largest hydroelectricity facility in the world. The final generator was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1,345 megawatts at the time. Original plans called for 16 large generators, eight on each side of the river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam&#x27;s total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable.

Before water from Lake Mead reaches the turbines, it enters the intake towers and then four gradually narrowing penstocks which funnel the water down towards the powerhouse. The intakes provide a maximum hydraulic head (water pressure) of as the water reaches a speed of about . The entire flow of the Colorado River usually passes through the turbines. The spillways and outlet works (jet-flow gates) are rarely used. The jet-flow gates, located in concrete structures above the river and also at the outlets of the inner diversion tunnels at river level, may be used to divert water around the dam in emergency or flood conditions, but have never done so, and in practice are used only to drain water from the penstocks for maintenance. Following an uprating project from 1986 to 1993, the total gross power rating for the plant, including two 2.4-megawatt Pelton turbine-generators that power Hoover Dam&#x27;s own operations is a maximum capacity of 2080 megawatts. The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies. The maximum net generation was 10.348 TWh in 1984, and the minimum since 1940 was 2.648 TWh in 1956. The average power generated was 4.2 TWh/year for 1947–2008. In 2015, the dam generated 3.6 TWh.

The amount of electricity generated by Hoover Dam has been decreasing along with the falling water level in Lake Mead due to the prolonged drought since year 2000 and high demand for the Colorado River&#x27;s water. By 2014 its generating capacity was downrated by 23% to 1592 MW and was providing power only during periods of peak demand. Lake Mead fell to a new record low elevation of on July 1, 2016, before beginning to rebound slowly. Under its original design, the dam would no longer be able to generate power once the water level fell below , which might have occurred in 2017 had water restrictions not been enforced. To lower the minimum power pool elevation from , five wide-head turbines, designed to work efficiently with less flow, were installed. Water levels were maintained at over in 2018 and 2019, but fell to a new record low of on June 10, 2021 and were projected to fall below by the end of 2021.

Control of water was the primary concern in the building of the dam. Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds from the sale of power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power is generated in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands.

Lake Mead and downstream releases from the dam also provide water for both municipal and irrigation uses. Water released from the Hoover Dam eventually reaches several canals. The Colorado River Aqueduct and Central Arizona Project branch off Lake Havasu while the All-American Canal is supplied by the Imperial Dam. In total, water from Lake Mead serves 18 million people in Arizona, Nevada, and California and supplies the irrigation of over of land.

In 2018, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) proposed a $3 billion pumped-storage hydroelectricity project—a &quot;battery&quot; of sorts—that would use wind and solar power to recirculate water back up to Lake Mead from a pumping station downriver.

==== Power distribution ====
Electricity from the dam&#x27;s powerhouse was originally sold pursuant to a fifty-year contract, authorized by Congress in 1934, which ran from 1937 to 1987. In 1984, Congress passed a new statute which set power allocations to southern California, Arizona, and Nevada from the dam from 1987 to 2017. The powerhouse was run under the original authorization by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Southern California Edison; in 1987, the Bureau of Reclamation assumed control. In 2011, Congress enacted legislation extending the current contracts until 2067, after setting aside 5% of Hoover Dam&#x27;s power for sale to Native American tribes, electric cooperatives, and other entities. The new arrangement began on October 1, 2017.

The Bureau of Reclamation reports that the energy generated under the contracts ending in 2017 was allocated as follows:
=== Spillways ===

The dam is protected against over-topping by two spillways. The spillway entrances are located behind each dam abutment, running roughly parallel to the canyon walls. The spillway entrance arrangement forms a classic side-flow weir with each spillway containing four and steel-drum gates. Each gate weighs and can be operated manually or automatically. Gates are raised and lowered depending on water levels in the reservoir and flood conditions. The gates cannot entirely prevent water from entering the spillways but can maintain an extra of lake level.

Water flowing over the spillways falls dramatically into , spillway tunnels before connecting to the outer diversion tunnels and reentering the main river channel below the dam. This complex spillway entrance arrangement combined with the approximate elevation drop from the top of the reservoir to the river below was a difficult engineering problem and posed numerous design challenges. Each spillway&#x27;s capacity of was empirically verified in post-construction tests in 1941.

The large spillway tunnels have only been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. Both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock. The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused cavitation, a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and the surface of the concrete was polished mirror-smooth. The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway&#x27;s effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways. Tests at Grand Coulee Dam showed that the technique worked, in principle.

=== Roadway and tourism ===


There are two lanes for automobile traffic across the top of the dam, which formerly served as the Colorado River crossing for U.S. Route 93. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, authorities expressed security concerns and the Hoover Dam Bypass project was expedited. Pending the completion of the bypass, restricted traffic was permitted over Hoover Dam. Some types of vehicles were inspected prior to crossing the dam while semi-trailer trucks, buses carrying luggage, and enclosed-box trucks over long were not allowed on the dam at all, and were diverted to U.S. Route 95 or Nevada State Routes 163/68. The four-lane Hoover Dam Bypass opened on October 19, 2010. It includes a composite steel and concrete arch bridge, the Mike O&#x27;Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge, downstream from the dam.
With the opening of the bypass, through traffic is no longer allowed across Hoover Dam; dam visitors are allowed to use the existing roadway to approach from the Nevada side and cross to parking lots and other facilities on the Arizona side.

Hoover Dam opened for tours in 1937 after its completion but following Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, it was closed to the public when the United States entered World War II, during which only authorized traffic, in convoys, was permitted. After the war, it reopened September 2, 1945, and by 1953, annual attendance had risen to 448,081. The dam closed on November 25, 1963, and March 31, 1969, days of mourning in remembrance of Presidents Kennedy and Eisenhower. In 1995, a new visitors&#x27; center was built, and the following year, visits exceeded one million for the first time. The dam closed again to the public on September 11, 2001; modified tours were resumed in December and a new &quot;Discovery Tour&quot; was added the following year. Today, nearly a million people per year take the tours of the dam offered by the Bureau of Reclamation. The government&#x27;s increased security concerns have led to the exclusion of visitors from most of the interior structures. As a result, few of True&#x27;s decorations can now be seen by visitors. Visitors can only purchase tickets on-site and have the options of a guided tour of the whole facility or only the power plant area. The only self-guided tour option is for the visitor center itself, where visitors can view various exhibits and enjoy a 360-degree view of the dam.

== Environmental impact ==
The changes in water flow and use caused by Hoover Dam&#x27;s construction and operation have had a large impact on the Colorado River Delta. The construction of the dam has been implicated in causing the decline of this estuarine ecosystem. For six years after the construction of the dam, while Lake Mead filled, virtually no water reached the mouth of the river. The delta&#x27;s estuary, which once had a freshwater-saltwater mixing zone stretching south of the river&#x27;s mouth, was turned into an inverse estuary where the level of salinity was higher close to the river&#x27;s mouth.

The Colorado River had experienced natural flooding before the construction of the Hoover Dam. The dam eliminated the natural flooding, threatening many species adapted to the flooding, including both plants and animals. The construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river downstream from the dam. Four species of fish native to the Colorado River, the Bonytail chub, Colorado pikeminnow, Humpback chub, and Razorback sucker, are listed as endangered.

== Naming controversy ==

During the years of lobbying leading up to the passage of legislation authorizing the dam in 1928, the press generally referred to the dam as &quot;Boulder Dam&quot; or as &quot;Boulder Canyon Dam&quot;, even though the proposed site had shifted to Black Canyon. The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 (BCPA) never mentioned a proposed name or title for the dam. The BCPA merely allows the government to &quot;construct, operate, and maintain a dam and incidental works in the main stream of the Colorado River at Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon&quot;.

When Secretary of the Interior Ray Wilbur spoke at the ceremony starting the building of the railway between Las Vegas and the dam site on September 17, 1930, he named the dam &quot;Hoover Dam&quot;, citing a tradition of naming dams after Presidents, though none had been so honored during their terms of office. Wilbur justified his choice on the ground that Hoover was &quot;the great engineer whose vision and persistence ... has done so much to make [the dam] possible&quot;. One writer complained in response that &quot;the Great Engineer had quickly drained, ditched, and dammed the country.&quot;

After Hoover&#x27;s election defeat in 1932 and the accession of the Roosevelt administration, Secretary Ickes ordered on May 13, 1933, that the dam be referred to as Boulder Dam. Ickes stated that Wilbur had been imprudent in naming the dam after a sitting president, that Congress had never ratified his choice, and that it had long been referred to as Boulder Dam. Unknown to the general public, Attorney General Homer Cummings informed Ickes that Congress had indeed used the name &quot;Hoover Dam&quot; in five different bills appropriating money for construction of the dam. The official status this conferred to the name &quot;Hoover Dam&quot; had been noted on the floor of the House of Representatives by Congressman Edward T. Taylor of Colorado on December 12, 1930, but was likewise ignored by Ickes.

When Ickes spoke at the dedication ceremony on September 30, 1935, he was determined, as he recorded in his diary, &quot;to try to nail down for good and all the name Boulder Dam.&quot; At one point in the speech, he spoke the words &quot;Boulder Dam&quot; five times within thirty seconds. Further, he suggested that if the dam were to be named after any one person, it should be for California Senator Hiram Johnson, a lead sponsor of the authorizing legislation. Roosevelt also referred to the dam as Boulder Dam, and the Republican-leaning &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, which at the time of Ickes&#x27; name change had run an editorial cartoon showing Ickes ineffectively chipping away at an enormous sign &quot;HOOVER DAM&quot;, reran it showing Roosevelt reinforcing Ickes, but having no greater success.

In the following years, the name &quot;Boulder Dam&quot; failed to fully take hold, with many Americans using both names interchangeably and mapmakers divided as to which name should be printed. Memories of the Great Depression faded, and Hoover to some extent rehabilitated himself through good works during and after World War II. In 1947, a bill passed both Houses of Congress unanimously restoring the name &quot;Hoover Dam.&quot; Ickes, who was by then a private citizen, opposed the change, stating, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know Hoover was that small a man to take credit for something he had nothing to do with.&quot;

==Recognition==
Hoover Dam was recognized as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1984. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985, cited for its engineering innovations.

<text>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a picaresque novel by American author Mark Twain that was first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885.

Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry &quot;Huck&quot; Finn, the narrator of two other Twain novels (&quot;Tom Sawyer Abroad&quot; and &quot;Tom Sawyer, Detective&quot;) and a friend of Tom Sawyer. It is a direct sequel to &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;.

The book is noted for &quot;changing the course of children&#x27;s literature&quot; in the United States for the &quot;deeply felt portrayal of boyhood&quot;. It is also known for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in a Southern antebellum society that had ceased to exist over 20 years before the work was published, &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; is an often scathing satire on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism.

Perennially popular with readers, &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; has also been the continued object of study by literary critics since its publication. The book was widely criticized upon release because of its extensive use of coarse language and racial epithets. Throughout the 20th century, and despite arguments that the protagonist and the tenor of the book are anti-racist, criticism of the book continued due to both its perceived use of racial stereotypes and its frequent use of the racial slur &quot;nigger&quot;.

== Plot ==

In St. Petersburg, Missouri, during the 1840s, Huckleberry Finn has received a considerable sum of money following &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;, and the Widow Douglas and her sister Miss Watson become his guardians. Despite preferring life as an errant boy, Huck stays so he can be part of Tom Sawyer&#x27;s gang. Huck’s father, &quot;Pap&quot;, an abusive alcoholic, tries to appropriate Huck&#x27;s fortune. When this fails, Pap imprisons him in a remote cabin.

After a delirium tremens crisis in which Pap tries to kill Huck, Huck fakes his own murder and settles on Jackson&#x27;s Island, where he reunites with Miss Watson&#x27;s slave Jim, who ran away after overhearing she was planning to sell him. Huck and Jim decide to go down the Mississippi River to Cairo, in the free state of Illinois. After a flood, they find a timber raft and a house floating downstream. Inside the house, Jim finds a man who was shot to death but prevents Huck from seeing. Huck sneaks into town and discovers there is a reward for Jim&#x27;s capture and he is suspected of killing Huck; they flee on their raft.

Huck and Jim come across a grounded steamboat on which two thieves discuss murdering a third. Finding their raft has drifted away, they flee in the thieves&#x27; boat. They find their raft and sink the thieves&#x27; boat, then Huck tricks a night watchman into a rescue attempt, which fails when the steamboat sinks. Huck and Jim are separated in a fog. When they reunite, Huck tricks Jim into thinking he dreamed the event. Jim is disappointed in Huck when Huck admits the truth. Huck is surprised by Jim&#x27;s strong feelings and apologizes.
Huck is conflicted about supporting a runaway slave, but when two white men seeking runaways come upon the raft, his lies convince them to leave. Jim and Huck realize they have passed Cairo. With no way to go upriver, they decide to continue downriver. The raft is struck by a passing steamship, again separating them. On the riverbank, Huck meets the Grangerfords, who are engaged in a 30-year feud with the Shepherdsons. After a Grangerford daughter elopes with a Shepherdson boy, all of the Grangerford men are killed in a Shepherdson ambush. Huck escapes and is reunited with Jim, who has recovered and repaired the raft.

Jim and Huck are joined by two confidence men claiming to be a King and a Duke, and they rope Huck and Jim into aiding in several scams. In one town, the King and the Duke cheat the townsfolk over two nights with a short, overpriced stage performance. On the third, the grifters collect the admission fee from previous audience members bent on revenge, then flee the town. In the next town, the swindlers impersonate the brothers of the recently deceased Peter Wilks and attempt to steal his estate. Huck tries to retrieve the money for Wilks&#x27;s orphaned nieces. Two other men claiming to be Wilks&#x27; brothers arrive, causing an uproar. Huck flees but is caught by the King and the Duke. He escapes but finds they sold Jim to the Phelpses. Huck vows to free Jim, despite believing he will go to hell for it.

The Phelpses mistake Huck for their nephew Tom, who is expected for a visit, and Huck plays along. Their nephew is Tom Sawyer, and when he arrive he pretends to be his brother Sid, and develops a theatrical plan to free Jim. Huck attempts to warn the King and the Duke that Jim alerted the local residents to their scam but sees them tarred and feathered and being run out of town on a rail.

Tom is wounded during Jim&#x27;s escape. Instead of fleeing, Jim stays to tend to him and is arrested and returned to the Phelpses. Tom&#x27;s Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck&#x27;s and Tom&#x27;s true identities. She explains that Miss Watson has died, and that she freed Jim in her will. Tom admits he knew but wanted to &quot;rescue&quot; Jim in style. Jim tells Huck Pap was the dead man in the floating house. Huck declares he will flee to Indian Territory to escape adoption by the Phelpses.

== Characters ==


In order of appearance:
*Tom Sawyer is Huck&#x27;s best friend and peer, the main character of other Twain novels and the leader of the town boys in adventures. He is mischievous, good-hearted, and &quot;the best fighter and the smartest kid in town&quot;.
* Huckleberry Finn, &quot;Huck&quot; to his friends, is a boy about &quot;thirteen or fourteen or along there&quot; years old (Chapter 17). He has been brought up by his father, the town drunk, and has a difficult time fitting into society. Huck&#x27;s good nature offers a contrast to the inadequacies and inequalities in society.
* Widow Douglas is the kind woman who takes Huck in after he helps save her from a violent home invasion. She tries her best to &quot;sivilize&quot; (civilize) Huck, believing it is her Christian duty to do so.
* Miss Watson is the widow&#x27;s sister, a tough old spinster who also lives with them. She is fairly hard on Huck, causing him to resent her a good deal. Mark Twain may have drawn inspiration for this character from several people he knew in his life.
* Jim is Miss Watson&#x27;s physically large but mild-mannered slave. Huck becomes very close to Jim when they reunite after Jim flees Miss Watson&#x27;s household to seek refuge from slavery, and Huck and Jim become fellow travelers on the Mississippi River. Jim is shown to be honorable, perceptive, and intelligent, despite his lack of education and prejudice he faces. 
* &quot;Pap&quot; Finn is Huck&#x27;s father, a brutal alcoholic drifter. He resents Huck getting any kind of education. His only genuine interest in his son involves begging or extorting money to feed his alcohol addiction.
* Judith Loftus plays a small part in the novel — as the kind and perceptive woman whom Huck talks to in order to find out about the search for Jim — but many critics believe her to be the best drawn female character in the novel.
* The Grangerfords, an aristocratic Kentuckian family headed by the Colonel Saul Grangerford, take Huck in after he is separated from Jim on the Mississippi. Huck becomes close friends with the youngest male of the family, Buck Grangerford, who is Huck&#x27;s age. By the time Huck meets them, the Grangerfords have been engaged in an age-old blood feud with another local family, the Shepherdsons.
* The Duke and the King are two otherwise unnamed con artists whom Huck and Jim take aboard their raft just before the start of their Arkansas adventures. They pose as the long-lost Duke of Bridgewater and the long dead Lost Dauphin of France in an attempt to over-awe Huck and Jim, who quickly recognize their con but pretend to accept their claims to avoid conflict.
* Doctor Robinson is the only one who recognizes the King and Duke are phonies when they pretend to be British. He warns the townspeople, but they ignore him.
* Mary Jane, Joanna, and Susan Wilks are the three young nieces of their wealthy guardian, Peter Wilks, who has recently died. The Duke and the King try to steal their inheritance by posing as Peter&#x27;s estranged brothers from England but are eventually thwarted.
* Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas Phelps buy Jim from the Duke and the King. She is a loving, high-strung &quot;farmer&#x27;s wife&quot;, and he a plodding old man, both a farmer and a preacher.

== Themes ==
&quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; explores themes of race and identity; what it means to be free and civilized; and the ideas of humanity and social responsibility in the changing landscape of America. A complexity exists concerning Jim&#x27;s character. While some scholars point out that Jim is good-hearted and moral, and he is not unintelligent (in contrast to several of the more negatively depicted white characters), others have criticized the novel as racist, citing the use of the word &quot;nigger&quot; and emphasizing the stereotypically &quot;comic&quot; treatment of Jim&#x27;s lack of education, superstition and ignorance. This argument is supported by incidents early in the novel where Huck deliberately &quot;tricks&quot; Jim, taking advantage of his gullibility and Jim still remains loyal to him.

But this novel is also Huck&#x27;s &#x27;coming of age&#x27; story where he overcomes his initial biases and forms a deeper bond with Jim. Throughout the story, Huck is in moral conflict with the received values of the society in which he lives. Huck is unable consciously to rebut those values even in his thoughts, but he makes a moral choice based on his own valuation of Jim&#x27;s friendship and human worth, a decision in direct opposition to the things he has been taught. Twain, in his lecture notes, proposes that &quot;a sound heart is a surer guide than an ill-trained conscience&quot; and goes on to describe the novel as &quot;a book of mine where a sound heart and a deformed conscience come into collision and conscience suffers defeat&quot;.

To highlight the hypocrisy required to condone slavery within an ostensibly moral system, Twain has Huck&#x27;s father enslave his son, isolate him and beat him. When Huck escapes, he immediately encounters Jim &quot;illegally&quot; doing the same thing. The treatments both of them receive are radically different, especially in an encounter with Mrs. Judith Loftus who takes pity on who she presumes to be a runaway apprentice, Huck, yet boasts about her husband sending the hounds after a runaway slave, Jim.

Some scholars discuss Huck&#x27;s own character, and the novel itself, in the context of its relation to African-American culture as a whole. John Alberti quotes Shelley Fisher Fishkin, who writes in her 1990s book &quot;Was Huck Black?: Mark Twain and African-American Voices&quot;, &quot;by limiting their field of inquiry to the periphery, [white scholars] have missed the ways in which African-American voices shaped Twain&#x27;s creative imagination at its core.&quot; It is suggested that the character of Huckleberry Finn illustrates the correlation, and even interrelatedness, between white and Black culture in the United States.

== Illustrations ==
The original illustrations were done by E. W. Kemble, at the time a young artist working for &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Kemble was hand-picked by Twain, who admired his work. Hearn suggests that Twain and Kemble had a similar skill, writing that:
Whatever he may have lacked in technical grace ... Kemble shared with the greatest illustrators the ability to give even the minor individual in a text his own distinct visual personality; just as Twain so deftly defined a full-rounded character in a few phrases, so too did Kemble depict with a few strokes of his pen that same entire personage.

As Kemble could afford only one model, most of his illustrations produced for the book were done by guesswork. When the novel was published, the illustrations were praised even as the novel was harshly criticized. E.W. Kemble produced another set of illustrations for Harper&#x27;s and the American Publishing Company in 1898 and 1899 after Twain lost the copyright.

== Publication&#x27;s effect on literary climate ==
Twain initially conceived of the work as a sequel to &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled &quot;Huckleberry Finn&#x27;s Autobiography.&quot; Twain worked on the manuscript off and on for the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck&#x27;s development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress and set it aside for several years. After making a trip down the Hudson River, Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel&#x27;s title closely paralleled its predecessor&#x27;s: &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer&#x27;s Comrade)&quot;.

Mark Twain composed the story in pen on notepaper between 1876 and 1883. Paul Needham, who supervised the authentication of the manuscript for Sotheby&#x27;s books and manuscripts department in New York in 1991, stated, &quot;What you see is [Clemens&#x27;] attempt to move away from pure literary writing to dialect writing&quot;. For example, Twain revised the opening line of &quot;Huck Finn&quot; three times. He initially wrote, &quot;You will not know about me&quot;, which he changed to, &quot;You do not know about me&quot;, before settling on the final version, &quot;You don&#x27;t know about me, without you have read a book by the name of &#x27;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&#x27;; but that ain&#x27;t no matter.&quot; The revisions also show how Twain reworked his material to strengthen the characters of Huck and Jim, as well as his sensitivity to the then-current debate over literacy and voting.

A later version was the first typewritten manuscript delivered to a printer.

Demand for the book spread outside of the United States. &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; was eventually published on December 10, 1884, in Canada and the United Kingdom, and on February 18, 1885, in the United States. The illustration on page 283 became a point of issue after an engraver, whose identity was never discovered, made a last-minute addition to the printing plate of Kemble&#x27;s picture of old Silas Phelps, which drew attention to Phelps&#x27; groin. Thirty thousand copies of the book had been printed before the obscenity was discovered. A new plate was made to correct the illustration and repair the existing copies.

In 1885, the Buffalo Public Library&#x27;s curator, James Fraser Gluck, approached Twain to donate the manuscript to the library. Twain did so. Later it was believed that half of the pages had been misplaced by the printer. In 1991, the missing first half turned up in a steamer trunk owned by descendants of Gluck&#x27;s. The library successfully claimed possession and, in 1994, opened the Mark Twain Room to showcase the treasure.

In relation to the literary climate at the time of the book&#x27;s publication in 1885, Henry Nash Smith describes the importance of Mark Twain&#x27;s already established reputation as a &quot;professional humorist&quot;, having already published over a dozen other works. Smith suggests that while the &quot;dismantling of the decadent Romanticism of the later nineteenth century was a necessary operation,&quot; &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; illustrated &quot;previously inaccessible resources of imaginative power, but also made vernacular language, with its new sources of pleasure and new energy, available for American prose and poetry in the twentieth century.&quot;

== Critical reception and banning ==
While it is clear that &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; was controversial from the outset, Norman Mailer, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1984, concluded that Twain&#x27;s novel was not initially &quot;too unpleasantly regarded.&quot; In fact, Mailer writes: &quot;the critical climate could hardly anticipate T. S. Eliot and Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s encomiums 50 years later,&quot; reviews that would remain longstanding in the American consciousness.

Alberti suggests that the academic establishment responded to the book&#x27;s challenges both dismissively and with confusion. During Twain&#x27;s time and today, defenders of &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; &quot;lump all nonacademic critics of the book together as extremists and &#x27;censors&#x27;, thus equating the complaints about the book&#x27;s &#x27;coarseness&#x27; from the genteel bourgeois trustees of the Concord Public Library in the 1880s with more recent objections based on race and civil rights.&quot;

Upon issue of the American edition in 1885, several libraries banned it from their shelves. The early criticism focused on what was perceived as the book&#x27;s crudeness. One incident was recounted in the newspaper the &quot;Boston Transcript&quot;:

The Concord (Mass.) Public Library committee has decided to exclude Mark Twain&#x27;s latest book from the library. One member of the committee says that, while he does not wish to call it immoral, he thinks it contains but little humor, and that of a very coarse type. He regards it as the veriest trash. The library and the other members of the committee entertain similar views, characterizing it as rough, coarse, and inelegant, dealing with a series of experiences not elevating, the whole book being more suited to the slums than to intelligent, respectable people.
Writer Louisa May Alcott criticized the book&#x27;s publication as well, saying that if Twain &quot;[could not] think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them&quot;.

In 1905, New York&#x27;s Brooklyn Public Library also banned the book due to &quot;bad word choice&quot; and Huck&#x27;s having &quot;not only itched but scratched&quot; within the novel, which was considered obscene. When asked by a Brooklyn librarian about the situation, Twain sardonically replied: I am greatly troubled by what you say. I wrote &#x27;Tom Sawyer&#x27; &amp; &#x27;Huck Finn&#x27; for adults exclusively, &amp; it always distressed me when I find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them. The mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be washed clean. I know this by my own experience, &amp; to this day I cherish an unappeased bitterness against the unfaithful guardians of my young life, who not only permitted but compelled me to read an unexpurgated Bible through before I was 15 years old. None can do that and ever draw a clean sweet breath again on this side of the grave.

Many subsequent critics, Ernest Hemingway among them, have deprecated the final chapters, claiming the book &quot;devolves into little more than minstrel-show satire and broad comedy&quot; after Jim is detained. Although Hemingway declared, &quot;All modern American literature comes from&quot; &quot;Huck Finn&quot;, and hailed it as &quot;the best book we&#x27;ve had&quot;, he cautioned, &quot;If you must read it you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys. That is the real end. The rest is just cheating.&quot; The African-American writer Ralph Ellison argued that &quot;Hemingway completely missed the structural, symbolic and moral necessity for that part of the plot in which the boys rescue Jim. Yet it is precisely this part which gives the novel its significance.&quot; Pulitzer Prize winner Ron Powers states in his Twain biography (&quot;Mark Twain: A Life&quot;) that &quot;Huckleberry Finn endures as a consensus masterpiece despite these final chapters&quot;, in which Tom Sawyer leads Huck through elaborate machinations to rescue Jim.

== Controversy ==
In his introduction to &quot;The Annotated Huckleberry Finn&quot;, Michael Patrick Hearn writes that Twain &quot;could be uninhibitedly vulgar&quot;, and quotes critic William Dean Howells, a Twain contemporary, who wrote that the author&#x27;s &quot;humor was not for most women&quot;. However, Hearn continues by explaining that &quot;the reticent Howells found nothing in the proofs of Huckleberry Finn so offensive that it needed to be struck out&quot;.

=== Racial stereotyping ===
Much of modern scholarship of &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; has focused on its treatment of race. Many Twain scholars have argued that the book, by humanizing Jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery, is an attack on racism. Others have argued that the book falls short on this score, especially in its depiction of Jim. According to Professor Stephen Railton of the University of Virginia, Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of Black people that White readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim&#x27;s expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late 19th-century racist stereotypes.

In one instance, the controversy caused a drastically altered interpretation of the text: in 1955, CBS tried to avoid controversial material in a televised version of the book, by deleting all mention of slavery and omitting the character of Jim entirely.

=== Use of the word &quot;nigger&quot; ===

Because of this controversy over whether &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is racist or anti-racist, and because the word &quot;nigger&quot; is frequently used in the novel (a commonly used word in Twain&#x27;s time that has since become vulgar and taboo), many have questioned the appropriateness of teaching the book in the U.S. public school system—this questioning of the word &quot;nigger&quot; is illustrated by a school administrator of Virginia in 1982 calling the novel the &quot;most grotesque example of racism I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life&quot;. According to the American Library Association, &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; was the fifth-most frequently challenged book in the United States during the 1990s.

There have been several more recent cases involving protests for the banning of the novel. In 2003, high school student Calista Phair and her grandmother, Beatrice Clark, in Renton, Washington, proposed banning the book from classroom learning in the Renton School District, though not from any public libraries, because of the word &quot;nigger&quot;. The two curriculum committees that considered her request eventually decided to keep the novel on the 11th grade curriculum, though they suspended it until a panel had time to review the novel and set a specific teaching procedure for the novel&#x27;s controversial topics.

In 2009, a white Washington state high school teacher, John Foley, called for replacing &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; with a more modern novel. In an opinion column that Foley wrote in the &quot;Seattle Post Intelligencer&quot;, he states that all &quot;novels that use the &#x27;N-word&#x27; repeatedly need to go.&quot; He states that teaching the novel is not only unnecessary, but difficult due to the offensive language within the novel with many students becoming uncomfortable at &quot;just hear[ing] the N-word.&quot;

In 2016, &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; was removed from a public school district in Virginia, along with the novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, due to their use of racial slurs.

==== Expurgated editions ====

Publishers have made their own attempts at easing the controversy by way of releasing editions of the book with the word &quot;nigger&quot; replaced by less controversial words. A 2011 edition of the book, published by NewSouth Books, employed the word &quot;slave&quot; (although the word is not properly applied to a freed man). Their argument for making the change was to offer the reader a choice of reading a &quot;sanitized&quot; version if they were not comfortable with the original. Mark Twain scholar Alan Gribben said he hoped the edition would be more friendly for use in classrooms, rather than have the work banned outright from classroom reading lists due to its language.

According to publisher Suzanne La Rosa, &quot;At NewSouth, we saw the value in an edition that would help the works find new readers. If the publication sparks good debate about how language impacts learning or about the nature of censorship or the way in which racial slurs exercise their baneful influence, then our mission in publishing this new edition of Twain&#x27;s works will be more emphatically fulfilled.&quot; Another scholar, Thomas Wortham, criticized the changes, saying the new edition &quot;doesn&#x27;t challenge children to ask, &#x27;Why would a childlike Huck use such reprehensible language?&#x27;&quot;

<text>A harpsichord is a musical instrument played by means of a keyboard. Depressing a key raises its back end within the instrument, which in turn raises a mechanism with a small plectrum made from quill or plastic that plucks one or more strings. The strings are under tension on a soundboard, which is mounted in a wooden case; the soundboard amplifies the vibrations from the strings so that the listeners can hear it. Like a pipe organ, a harpsichord may have more than one keyboard manual and even a pedal board. Harpsichords may also have stop levers which add or remove additional octaves. Some harpsichords may have a buff stop, which brings a strip of buff leather or other material in contact with the strings, muting their sound to simulate the sound of a plucked lute.

The term denotes the whole family of similar plucked-keyboard instruments, including the smaller virginals, muselar, and spinet. The harpsichord was widely used in Renaissance and Baroque music, both as an accompaniment instrument and as a soloing instrument. During the Baroque era, the harpsichord was a standard part of the continuo group. The basso continuo part acted as the foundation for many musical pieces in this era. During the late 18th century, with the development of the fortepiano (and then the increasing use of the piano in the 19th century) the harpsichord gradually disappeared from the musical scene (except in opera, where it continued to be used to accompany recitative). In the 20th century, it made a resurgence, being used in historically informed performances of older music, in new compositions, and, in rare cases, in certain styles of popular music (e.g., Baroque pop).

==History==

The harpsichord was most likely invented in the late Middle Ages. By the 16th century, harpsichord makers in Italy were making lightweight instruments with low tension brass stringing. A different approach was taken in the Southern Netherlands starting in the late 16th century, notably by the Ruckers family. Their harpsichords used a heavier construction and produced a more powerful and distinctive tone with higher tension steel treble stringing. These included the first harpsichords with two keyboards, used for transposition.

The Flemish instruments served as the model for 18th-century harpsichord construction in other nations. In France, the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs of strings, making a more musically flexible instrument (so-called &#x27;expressive doubles&#x27;). Instruments from the peak of the French tradition, by makers such as the Blanchet family and Pascal Taskin, are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords, and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments. In England, the Kirkman and Shudi firms produced sophisticated harpsichords of great power and sonority. German builders such as Hieronymus Albrecht Hass extended the sound repertoire of the instrument by adding sixteen-foot and two-foot choirs; these instruments have recently served as models for modern builders.

Around the year 1700 the first fortepiano was built by Bartolomeo Cristofori. The early fortepiano uses percussion, the strings being struck with leathered paper hammers instead of being plucked. Unlike the harpsichord, the fortepiano is capable of changes in dynamic volume, giving it its name. By the late 18th century the harpsichord was supplanted by the piano and almost disappeared from view for most of the 19th century: an exception was its continued use in opera for accompanying recitative, but the piano sometimes displaced it even there.

Twentieth-century efforts to revive the harpsichord began with instruments that used piano technology, with heavy strings and metal frames. Starting in the middle of the 20th century, ideas about harpsichord making underwent a major change, when builders such as Frank Hubbard, William Dowd, and Martin Skowroneck sought to re-establish the building traditions of the Baroque period. Harpsichords of this type of historically informed building practice dominate the current scene.

==Mechanism==

Harpsichords vary in size and shape, but all have the same basic mechanism. The player depresses a key that rocks over a pivot in the middle of its length. The other end of the key lifts a jack (a long strip of wood) that holds a small plectrum (a wedge-shaped piece of quill, often made of plastic in the 21st century), which plucks the string. When the player releases the key, the far end returns to its rest position, and the jack falls back; the plectrum, mounted on a tongue mechanism that can swivel backwards away from the string, passes the string without plucking it again. As the key reaches its rest position, a felt damper atop the jack stops the string&#x27;s vibrations. These basic principles are explained in detail below. 
* The &quot;keylever&quot; is a simple pivot, which rocks on a &quot;balance pin&quot; that passes through a hole drilled through the keylever.
* The &quot;jack&quot; is a thin, rectangular piece of wood that sits upright on the end of the keylever. The jacks are held in place by the &quot;registers&quot;. These are two long strips of wood (the upper movable, the lower fixed), which run in the gap between pinblock and bellyrail. The registers have rectangular mortises (holes) through which the jacks pass as they can move up and down. The registers hold the jacks in the precise location needed to pluck the string.
* In the jack, a &quot;plectrum&quot; juts out almost horizontally (normally the plectrum is angled upwards a tiny amount) and passes just under the string. Historically, plectra were made of bird quill or leather; many modern harpsichords have plastic (delrin or celcon) plectra.
* When the front of the key is pressed, the back of the key rises, the jack is lifted, and the plectrum plucks the string.
* The vertical motion of the jack is then stopped by the &quot;jackrail&quot; (also called the &quot;upper rail&quot;), which is covered with soft felt to muffle the impact.
* When the key is released, the jack falls back down under its own weight, and the plectrum passes back under the string. This is made possible by having the plectrum held in a tongue attached with a pivot and a spring to the body of the jack. The bottom surface of the plectrum is cut at a slant; thus when the descending plectrum touches the string from above, the angled lower surface provides enough force to push the tongue backward.
* When the jack arrives in fully lowered position, the felt damper touches the string, causing the note to cease.

==Strings, tuning, and soundboard==
Each string is wound around a &quot;tuning pin&quot; (also known as a &quot;wrest pin&quot;) at the end nearest the player. When rotated with a wrench or tuning hammer, the tuning pin adjusts the tension so that the string sounds the correct pitch. Tuning pins are held tightly in holes drilled in the &quot;pinblock&quot; or &quot;wrestplank&quot;, an oblong hardwood plank. Proceeding from the tuning pin, a string next passes over the &quot;nut&quot;, a sharp edge that is made of hardwood and is normally attached to the wrestplank. The section of the string beyond the nut forms its &quot;vibrating length&quot;, which is plucked and creates sound.

At the other end of its vibrating length, the string passes over the bridge, another sharp edge made of hardwood. As with the nut, the horizontal position of the string along the bridge is determined by a vertical metal pin inserted into the bridge, against which the string rests. The bridge itself rests on a &quot;soundboard&quot;, a thin panel of wood usually made of spruce, fir or—in some Italian harpsichords—cypress. The soundboard efficiently transmits the vibrations of the strings into vibrations in the air; without a soundboard, the strings would produce only a very feeble sound. A string is attached at its far end by a loop to a &quot;hitchpin&quot; that secures it to the case.

==Multiple manuals and choirs of strings==
While many harpsichords have one string per note, more elaborate harpsichords can have two or more strings for each note. When there are multiple strings for each note, these additional strings are called &quot;choirs&quot; of strings. This provides two advantages: the ability to vary volume and ability to vary tonal quality. Volume is increased when the mechanism of the instrument is set up by the player (see below) so that the press of a single key plucks more than one string. Tonal quality can be varied in two ways. First, different choirs of strings can be designed to have distinct tonal qualities, usually by having one set of strings plucked closer to the nut, which emphasizes the higher harmonics, and produces a &quot;nasal&quot; sound quality. The mechanism of the instrument, called &quot;stops&quot; (following the use of the term in pipe organs) permits the player to select one choir or the other. Second, having one key pluck two strings at once changes not just volume but also tonal quality; for instance, when two strings tuned to the same pitch are plucked simultaneously, the note is not just louder but also richer and more complex.

A particularly vivid effect is obtained when the strings plucked simultaneously are an octave apart. This is normally heard by the ear not as two pitches but as one: the sound of the higher string is blended with that of the lower one, and the ear hears the lower pitch, enriched in tonal quality by the additional strength in the upper harmonics of the note sounded by the higher string.

When describing a harpsichord it is customary to specify its choirs of strings, often called its disposition. To describe the pitch of the choirs of strings, pipe organ terminology is used. Strings at eight-foot pitch (8&#x27;) sound at the normal expected pitch, strings at four-foot pitch (4&#x27;) sound an octave higher. Harpsichords occasionally include a sixteen-foot (16&#x27;) choir (one octave lower than eight-foot) or a two-foot (2&#x27;) choir (two octaves higher; quite rare). When there are multiple choirs of strings, the player is often able to control which choirs sound. This is usually done by having a set of jacks for each choir, and a mechanism for &quot;turning off&quot; each set, often by moving the upper register (through which the jacks slide) sideways a short distance, so that their plectra miss the strings. In simpler instruments this is done by manually moving the registers, but as the harpsichord evolved, builders invented levers, knee levers and pedal mechanisms to make it easier to change registration.

Harpsichords with more than one keyboard (this usually means two keyboards, stacked one on top of the other in a step-wise fashion, as with pipe organs) provide flexibility in selecting which strings play, since each manual can be set to control the plucking of a different set of strings. This means that a player can have, for instance, an 8&#x27; manual and a 4&#x27; manual ready for use, making it possible to switch between them to obtain higher (or lower) pitches or different tone. In addition, such harpsichords often have a mechanism (the &quot;coupler&quot;) that couples manuals together, so that a single manual plays both sets of strings.

The most flexible system is the French &quot;shove coupler&quot;, in which the lower manual slides forward and backward. In the backward position, &quot;dogs&quot; attached to the upper surface of the lower manual engage the lower surface of the upper manual&#x27;s keys. Depending on choice of keyboard and coupler position, the player can select any of the sets of jacks labeled in &quot;figure 4&quot; as A, or B and C, or all three.

The English &quot;dogleg&quot; jack system (also used in Baroque Flanders) does not require a coupler. The jacks labeled A in Figure 5 have a &quot;dogleg&quot; shape that permits either keyboard to play A. If the player wishes to play the upper 8&#x27; from the upper manual only and not from the lower manual, a stop handle disengages the jacks labeled A and engages instead an alternative row of jacks called &quot;lute stop&quot; (not shown in the Figure). A lute stop is used to imitate the gentle sound of a plucked lute.
 The use of multiple manuals in a harpsichord was not originally provided for the flexibility in choosing which strings would sound, but rather for transposition of the instrument to play in different keys (see &quot;History of the harpsichord&quot;).
Some early harpsichords used a short octave for the lowest register. The rationale behind this system was that the low notes F and G are seldom needed in early music. Deep bass notes typically form the root of the chord, and F and G chords were seldom used at this time. In contrast, low C and D, both roots of very common chords, are sorely missed if a harpsichord with lowest key E is tuned to match the keyboard layout. When scholars specify the pitch range of instruments with this kind of short octave, they write &quot;C/E&quot;, meaning that the lowest note is a C, played on a key that normally would sound E. In another arrangement, known as &quot;G/B&#x27;, the apparent lowest key B is tuned to G, and apparent C-sharp and D-sharp are tuned to A and B respectively.

==Case==
The wooden case holds in position all of the important structural members: pinblock, soundboard, hitchpins, keyboard, and the jack action. It usually includes a solid bottom, and also internal bracing to maintain its form without warping under the tension of the strings. Cases vary greatly in weight and sturdiness: Italian harpsichords are often of light construction; heavier construction is found in the later Flemish instruments and those derived from them.
The case also gives the harpsichord its external appearance and protects the instrument. A large harpsichord is, in a sense, a piece of furniture, as it stands alone on legs and may be styled in the manner of other furniture of its place and period. Early Italian instruments, on the other hand, were so light in construction that they were treated rather like a violin: kept for storage in a protective outer case, and played after taking it out of its case and placing it on a table. Such tables were often quite high – until the late 18th century people usually played standing up. Eventually, harpsichords came to be built with just a single case, though an intermediate stage also existed: the &quot;false inner–outer&quot;, which for purely aesthetic reasons was built to look as if the outer case contained an inner one, in the old style. Even after harpsichords became self-encased objects, they often were supported by separate stands, and some modern harpsichords have separate legs for improved portability.

Many harpsichords have a lid that can be raised, a cover for the keyboard, and a music stand for holding sheet music and scores.

Harpsichords have been decorated in a great many different ways: with plain buff paint (e.g. some Flemish instruments), with paper printed with patterns, with leather or velvet coverings, with chinoiserie, or occasionally with highly elaborate painted artwork.

==Variants==

===Virginals===
The virginal is a smaller and simpler rectangular form of the harpsichord having only one string per note; the strings run parallel to the keyboard, which is on the long side of the case.

===Spinet===

A spinet is a harpsichord with the strings set at an angle (usually about 30 degrees) to the keyboard. The strings are too close together for the jacks to fit between them. Instead, the strings are arranged in pairs, and the jacks are in the larger gaps between the pairs. The two jacks in each gap face in opposite directions, and each plucks a string adjacent to the gap.

The English diarist Samuel Pepys mentions his &quot;tryangle&quot; several times. This was not the percussion instrument that we call triangle today; rather, it was a name for octave-pitched spinets, which were triangular in shape.

===Clavicytherium===

A clavicytherium is a harpsichord with the soundboard and strings mounted vertically facing the player, the same space-saving principle as an upright piano. In a clavicytherium, the jacks move horizontally without the assistance of gravity, so that clavicytherium actions are more complex than those of other harpsichords.

===Ottavino===
Ottavini are small spinets or virginals at four-foot pitch. Harpsichords at octave pitch were more common in the early Renaissance, but lessened in popularity later on. However, the ottavino remained very popular as a domestic instrument in Italy until the 19th century. In the Low Countries, an ottavino was commonly paired with an 8&#x27; virginals, encased in a small cubby under the soundboard of the larger instrument. The ottavino could be removed and placed on top of the virginal, making, in effect, a double manual instrument. These are sometimes called &#x27;mother-and-child&#x27; or &#x27;double&#x27; virginals.

===Pedal harpsichord===
Occasionally, harpsichords were built which included another set or sets of strings underneath and played by foot-operated pedal keyboard which trigger the plucking of the lowest-pitched keys of the harpsichord. Although there are no known extant pedal harpsichords from the 18th century or before, from Adlung (1758): the lower set of usually 8&#x27; strings &quot;...is built like an ordinary harpsichord, but with an extent of two octaves only. The jacks are similar, but they will benefit from being arranged back to back, since the two [bass] octaves take as much space as four in an ordinary harpsichord Prior to 1980 when Keith Hill introduced his design for a pedal harpsichord, most pedal harpsichords were built based on the designs of extant pedal pianos from the 19th century, in which the instrument is as wide as the pedalboard. While these were mostly intended as practice instruments for organists, a few pieces are believed to have been written specifically for the pedal harpsichord. However, the set of pedals can augment the sound from any piece performed on the instrument, as demonstrated on several albums by E. Power Biggs.

===Other variants===
The archicembalo, built in the 16th century, had an unusual keyboard layout, designed to accommodate variant tuning systems demanded by compositional practice and theoretical experimentation. More common were instruments with split sharps, also designed to accommodate the tuning systems of the time.

The folding harpsichord was an instrument that could be folded up to make it more compact, thus facilitating travelling with it.

==Compass and pitch range==
On the whole, earlier harpsichords have smaller ranges than later ones, although there are many exceptions. The largest harpsichords have a range of just over five octaves, and the smallest have under four. Usually, the shortest keyboards were given extended range in the bass with a &quot;short octave&quot;. The traditional pitch range for a 5-octave instrument is F1–F6 (FF–f‴).

Tuning pitch is often taken to be A4 = 415 Hz, roughly a semitone lower than the modern standard concert pitch of A4 = 440 Hz. An accepted exception is for French baroque repertoire, which is often performed with a = 392 Hz, approximately a semitone lower again. See Jean-Philippe Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Harmony&quot; (1722) [Dover Publications], Book One, chapter five, for insight into French baroque tuning; &quot;Since most of these semitones are absolutely necessary in the tuning of organs and other similar instruments, the following chromatic system has been drawn up.&quot; Tuning an instrument nowadays usually starts with setting an A; historically it would commence from a C or an F. The harpsichord uses the bass clef (F clef).

Some modern instruments are built with keyboards that can shift sideways, allowing the player to align the mechanism with strings at either A = 415 Hz or A = 440 Hz. If a tuning other than equal temperament is used, the instrument requires retuning once the keyboard is shifted.

==Decoration==
Throughout the historical period, the harpsichord was characteristically decorated; for extensive discussion and illustration see Kottick (2003). Cases were painted in bright colors (especially in 18th century France), or covered with elaborate wood veneer (18th century England), or adorned with sculptural moldings and knobs (Italy). Soundboards bore paintings, either of individual items such as flowers and animals (Flanders, also France), or even (in expensive instruments), full-scale paintings of the kind usually executed on canvas. Keyboards could have the same &quot;white keys&quot; and &quot;black keys&quot; that pianos have today, but builders frequently employed the opposite pattern, with white sharps and black naturals. The study of harpsichord decoration became an important scholarly field in the 20th century, notably with the work of Sheridan Germann (2002), whose knowledge extended to the point of being able to pin down the particular anonymous artists who worked with particular builders.

==Music==

The great bulk of the standard repertoire for the harpsichord was written during its first historical flowering, the Renaissance and Baroque eras.

===Renaissance===
The first music written specifically for solo harpsichord was published around the early 16th century. Composers who wrote solo harpsichord music were numerous during the whole Baroque era in European countries including Italy, Germany, England and France. Solo harpsichord compositions included dance suites, fantasias, and fugues. Among the most famous composers who wrote for the harpsichord were the members of English virginal school of the late Renaissance, notably William Byrd ( 1540–1623). 

===Baroque era===
In France, a great number of highly characteristic solo works were created and compiled into four books of &quot;ordres&quot; by François Couperin (1668–1733). Domenico Scarlatti (1685–1757) began his career in Italy but wrote most of his solo harpsichord works in Spain; his most famous work is his series of 555 harpsichord sonatas. Perhaps the most celebrated composers who wrote for the harpsichord were Georg Friedrich Händel (1685–1759), who composed numerous suites for harpsichord, and especially J. S. Bach (1685–1750), whose solo works (for instance, &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; and the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;), continue to be performed very widely, often on the piano. Bach was also a pioneer of the harpsichord concerto, both in works designated as such, and in the harpsichord part of his Fifth Brandenburg Concerto.

===Classical period===
Two of the most prominent composers of the Classical era, Joseph Haydn (1732–1809) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791), wrote harpsichord music. For both, the instrument featured in the earlier period of their careers, and was largely supplanted by the piano starting roughly in the late 1770s.

===Music of the harpsichord revival===
Through the 19th century, the harpsichord was almost completely supplanted by the piano. In the 20th century, composers returned to the instrument, as they sought out variation in the sounds available to them. Under the influence of Arnold Dolmetsch, the harpsichordists Violet Gordon-Woodhouse (1872–1951) and in France, Wanda Landowska (1879–1959), were at the forefront of the instrument&#x27;s renaissance. Concertos for the instrument were written by Francis Poulenc (the &quot;Concert champêtre&quot;, 1927–28), and Manuel de Falla. Elliott Carter&#x27;s &quot;Double Concerto&quot; is scored for harpsichord, piano and two chamber orchestras. For a detailed account of music composed for the revived harpsichord, see Contemporary harpsichord.

<text>Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals.
The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types, and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably alpha-keratin.

Attitudes towards different forms of hair, such as hairstyles and hair removal, vary widely across different cultures and historical periods, but it is often used to indicate a person&#x27;s personal beliefs or social position, such as their age, gender, or religion.

==Overview==
===Meaning===

The word &quot;hair&quot; usually refers to two distinct structures: 
#the part beneath the skin, called the hair follicle, or, when pulled from the skin, the bulb or root. This organ is located in the dermis and maintains stem cells, which not only re-grow the hair after it falls out, but also are recruited to regrow skin after a wound.
# the hair shaft, which is the hard filamentous part that extends above the skin surface. It is made of multi-layered keratinized (dead) flat cells whose rope-like filaments provide structure and strength to it. The protein called keratin makes up most of its volume. A cross section of the hair shaft may be divided roughly into three zones.

Hair fibers have a structure consisting of several layers, starting from the outside:
# the cuticle, which consists of several layers of flat, thin cells laid out overlapping one another as roof shingles
# the cortex, which contains the keratin bundles in cell structures that remain roughly rod-like
# the medulla, a disorganized and open area at the fiber&#x27;s center

===Etymology===
The word &quot;hair&quot; is derived from and , in turn derived from and , with influence from . Both the Old English and Old Norse words derive from and are related to terms for hair in other Germanic languages such as , Dutch and , and . The now broadly obsolete word &quot;fax&quot; refers specifically to head hair and is found in compounds such as Fairfax and Halifax. It is derived from and is cognate with terms such as Old Norse and .

== Description ==
Each strand of hair is made up of the medulla, cortex, and cuticle. The innermost region, the medulla, is an open and unstructured region that is not always present. The highly structural and organized cortex, or second of three layers of the hair, is the primary source of mechanical strength and water uptake. The cortex contains melanin, which colors the fiber based on the number, distribution and types of melanin granules. The melanin may be evenly spaced or cluster around the edges of the hair. The shape of the follicle determines the shape of the cortex, and the shape of the fiber is related to how straight or curly the hair is. People with straight hair have round hair fibers. Oval and other shaped fibers are generally more wavy or curly. The cuticle is the outer covering. Its complex structure slides as the hair swells and is covered with a single molecular layer of lipid that makes the hair repel water. The diameter of human hair varies from . Some of these characteristics in humans&#x27; head hair vary by race: people of mostly African ancestry tend to have hair with a diameter of 60–90 μm and a flat cross-section, while people of mostly European or Middle Eastern ancestry tend to have hair with a diameter of 70–100 μm and an oval cross-section, and people of mostly Asian or Native American ancestry tend to have hair with a diameter of 90–120 μm and a round cross-section. There are roughly two million small, tubular glands and sweat glands that produce watery fluids that cool the body by evaporation. The glands at the opening of the hair produce a fatty secretion that lubricates the hair.

Hair growth begins inside the hair follicle. The only &quot;living&quot; portion of the hair is found in the follicle. The hair that is visible is the hair shaft, which exhibits no biochemical activity and is considered &quot;dead&quot;. The base of a hair&#x27;s root (the &quot;bulb&quot;) contains the cells that produce the hair shaft. Other structures of the hair follicle include the oil producing sebaceous gland which lubricates the hair and the arrector pili muscles, which are responsible for causing hairs to stand up. In humans with little body hair, the effect results in goose bumps.

===Root of the hair===

The &quot;root of the hair&quot; ends in an enlargement, the &quot;hair bulb&quot;, which is whiter in color and softer in texture than the shaft and is lodged in a follicular involution of the epidermis called the hair follicle. The bulb of hair consists of fibrous connective tissue, glassy membrane, external root sheath, internal root sheath composed of epithelium stratum (Henle&#x27;s layer) and granular stratum (Huxley&#x27;s layer), cuticle, cortex and medulla.

===Natural color===

All natural hair colors are the result of two types of hair pigments. Both of these pigments are melanin types, produced inside the hair follicle and packed into granules found in the fibers. Eumelanin is the dominant pigment in brown hair and black hair, while pheomelanin is dominant in red hair. Blond hair is the result of having little pigmentation in the hair strand. Gray hair occurs when melanin production decreases or stops, while poliosis is white hair (and often the skin to which the hair is attached), typically in spots that never possessed melanin at all, or ceased for natural reasons, generally genetic, in the first years of life.

===Human hair growth===

Hair grows everywhere on the external body except for mucous membranes and glabrous skin, such as that found on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips.

The body has different types of hair, including vellus hair and androgenic hair, each with its own type of cellular construction. The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly, warmth and protection.


The three stages of hair growth are the anagen, catagen, and telogen phases. Each strand of hair on the human body is at its own stage of development. Once the cycle is complete, it restarts and a new strand of hair begins to form. The growth rate of hair varies from individual to individual depending on their age, genetic predisposition and a number of environmental factors. It is commonly stated that hair grows about 1 cm per month on average; however reality is more complex, since not all hair grows at once. Scalp hair was reported to grow between 0.6 cm and 3.36 cm per month. The growth rate of scalp hair somewhat depends on age (hair tends to grow more slowly with age), sex, and ethnicity. Thicker hair (&gt;60 μm) grows generally faster (11.4 mm per month) than thinner (20-30 μm) hair (7.6 mm per month).

It was previously thought that Caucasian hair grew more quickly than Asian hair and that the growth rate of women&#x27;s hair was faster than that of men. However, more recent research has shown that the growth rate of hair in men and women does not significantly differ and that the hair of Chinese people grew more quickly than the hair of French Caucasians and West and Central Africans. The quantity of hair hovers in a certain range depending on hair colour. An average blonde person has 150,000 hairs, a brown-haired person has 110,000, a black-haired person has 100,000, and a redhead has 90,000. Hair growth stops after a human&#x27;s death. Visible growth of hair on the dead body happens only because of skin drying out due to water loss.

The world record for longest hair on a living person stands with Smita Srivastava of Uttar Pradesh, India. At 7 feet and 9 inches long, she broke a Guinness World Record in November 2023, having grown her hair for 32 years.

===Texture===

Hair exists in a variety of textures. Three main aspects of hair texture are the curl pattern, volume, and consistency. All mammalian hair is composed of keratin, so the make-up of hair follicles is not the source of varying hair patterns. There are a range of theories pertaining to the curl patterns of hair. Scientists have come to believe that the shape of the hair shaft has an effect on the curliness of the individual&#x27;s hair. A very round shaft allows for fewer disulfide bonds to be present in the hair strand. This means the bonds present are directly in line with one another, resulting in straight hair.
The flatter the hair shaft becomes, the curlier hair gets, because the shape allows more cysteines to become compacted together resulting in a bent shape that, with every additional disulfide bond, becomes curlier in form. As the hair follicle shape determines curl pattern, the hair follicle size determines thickness. While the circumference of the hair follicle expands, so does the thickness of the hair follicle. An individual&#x27;s hair volume, as a result, can be thin, normal, or thick. The consistency of hair can almost always be grouped into three categories: fine, medium, and coarse. This trait is determined by the hair follicle volume and the condition of the strand. Fine hair has the smallest circumference, coarse hair has the largest circumference, and medium hair is anywhere between the other two. Coarse hair has a more open cuticle than thin or medium hair causing it to be the most porous.

====Classification systems====
There are various systems that people use to classify their curl patterns. Being knowledgeable of an individual&#x27;s hair type is a good start to knowing how to take care of one&#x27;s hair. There is not just one method to discovering one&#x27;s hair type. Additionally it is possible, and quite normal to have more than one kind of hair type, for instance having a mixture of both type 3a &amp; 3b curls.

=====Andre Walker system=====
The Andre Walker Hair Typing System is the most widely used system to classify hair. The system was created by Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s hairstylist, Andre Walker. According to this system there are four types of hair: straight, wavy, curly, kinky.

* Type 1 is straight hair, which reflects the most sheen and also the most resilient hair of all of the hair types. It is hard to damage and immensely difficult to curl this hair texture. Because the sebum easily spreads from the scalp to the ends without curls or kinks to interrupt its path, it is the most oily hair texture of all.
* Type 2 is wavy hair, whose texture and sheen ranges somewhere between straight and curly hair. Wavy hair is also more likely to become frizzy than straight hair. While type A waves can easily alternate between straight and curly styles, type B and C wavy hair is resistant to styling.
* Type 3 is curly hair known to have an S-shape. The curl pattern may resemble a lowercase &quot;s&quot;, uppercase &quot;S&quot;, or sometimes an uppercase &quot;Z&quot; or lowercase &quot;z&quot;. Lack of proper care causes less defined curls.
* Type 4 is kinky hair, which features a tightly coiled curl pattern (or no discernible curl pattern at all) that is often fragile with a very high density. This type of hair shrinks when wet and because it has fewer cuticle layers than other hair types it is more susceptible to damage.

=====FIA system=====
This is a method which classifies the hair by curl pattern, hair-strand thickness and overall hair volume.

== Composition ==
Hair is mainly composed of keratin proteins and keratin-associated proteins (KRTAPs). The human genome encodes 54 different keratin proteins which are present in various amounts in hair. Similarly, humans encode more than 100 different KRTAPs which crosslink keratins in hair. The content of KRTAPs ranges from less than 3% in human hair to 30–40% in echidna quill.

==Functions==
Many mammals have fur and other hairs that serve different functions. Hair provides thermal regulation and camouflage for many animals; for others it provides signals to other animals such as warnings, mating, or other communicative displays; and for some animals hair provides defensive functions and, rarely, even offensive protection. Hair also has a sensory function, extending the sense of touch beyond the surface of the skin. Guard hairs give warnings that may trigger a recoiling reaction.

===Warmth===
While humans have developed clothing and other means of keeping warm, the hair found on the head serves primarily as a source of heat insulation and cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair) as well as protection from ultra-violet radiation exposure. The function of hair in other locations is debated. Hats and coats are still required while doing outdoor activities in cold weather to prevent frostbite and hypothermia, but the hair on the human body does help to keep the internal temperature regulated. When the body is too cold, the arrector pili muscles found attached to hair follicles stand up, causing the hair in these follicles to do the same. These hairs then form a heat-trapping layer above the epidermis. This process is formally called piloerection, derived from the Latin words &#x27;pilus&#x27; (&#x27;hair&#x27;) and &#x27;erectio&#x27; (&#x27;rising up&#x27;), but is more commonly known as &#x27;having goose bumps&#x27; in English. This is more effective in other mammals whose fur fluffs up to create air pockets between hairs that insulate the body from the cold. The opposite actions occur when the body is too warm; the arrector muscles make the hair lie flat on the skin which allows heat to leave.

===Protection===
In some mammals, such as hedgehogs and porcupines, the hairs have been modified into hard spines or quills. These are covered with thick plates of keratin and serve as protection against predators. Thick hair such as that of the lion&#x27;s mane and grizzly bear&#x27;s fur do offer some protection from physical damages such as bites and scratches.

===Touch sense===
Displacement and vibration of hair shafts are detected by hair follicle nerve receptors and nerve receptors within the skin. Hairs can sense movements of air as well as touch by physical objects and they provide sensory awareness of the presence of ectoparasites. Some hairs, such as eyelashes, are especially sensitive to the presence of potentially harmful matter.

====Eyebrows and eyelashes====
The eyebrows provide moderate protection to the eyes from dirt, sweat and rain. They also play a key role in non-verbal communication by displaying emotions such as sadness, anger, surprise and excitement. In many other mammals, they contain much longer, whisker-like hairs that act as tactile sensors.

The eyelash grows at the edges of the eyelid and protects the eye from dirt. The eyelash is to humans, camels, horses, ostriches etc., what whiskers are to cats; they are used to sense when dirt, dust, or any other potentially harmful object is too close to the eye. The eye reflexively closes as a result of this sensation.

Eyebrows and eyelashes do not grow beyond a certain length (eyelashes are rarely more than 10 mm long). However, trichomegaly can cause the lashes to grow remarkably long and prominent (in some cases the upper lashes grow to 15 mm long).

==Evolution==
Hair has its origins in the common ancestor of mammals, the synapsids, about 300 million years ago. It is currently unknown at what stage the synapsids acquired mammalian characteristics such as body hair and mammary glands, as the fossils only rarely provide direct evidence for soft tissues. Skin impression of the belly and lower tail of a pelycosaur, possibly &quot;Haptodus&quot; shows the basal synapsid stock bore transverse rows of rectangular scutes, similar to those of a modern crocodile, so the age of acquirement of hair logically could not have been earlier than ≈299 ma, based on the current understanding of the animal&#x27;s phylogeny. An exceptionally well-preserved skull of &quot;Estemmenosuchus&quot;, a therapsid from the Upper Permian, shows smooth, hairless skin with what appears to be glandular depressions, though as a semi-aquatic species it might not have been particularly useful to determine the integument of terrestrial species. The oldest undisputed known fossils showing unambiguous imprints of hair are the Callovian (late middle Jurassic) &quot;Castorocauda&quot; and several contemporary haramiyidans, both near-mammal cynodonts, giving the age as no later than ≈220 ma based on the modern phylogenetic understanding of these clades. More recently, studies on terminal Permian Russian coprolites may suggest that non-mammalian synapsids from that era had fur. If this is the case, these are the oldest hair remnants known, showcasing that fur occurred as far back as the latest Paleozoic.

Some modern mammals have a special gland in front of each orbit used to preen the fur, called the harderian gland. Imprints of this structure are found in the skull of the small early mammals like &quot;Morganucodon&quot;, but not in their cynodont ancestors like &quot;Thrinaxodon&quot;.

The hairs of the fur in modern animals are all connected to nerves, and so the fur also serves as a transmitter for sensory input. Fur could have evolved from sensory hair (whiskers). The signals from this sensory apparatus is interpreted in the neocortex, a section of the brain that expanded markedly in animals like &quot;Morganucodon&quot; and &quot;Hadrocodium&quot;. The more advanced therapsids could have had a combination of naked skin, whiskers, and scutes. A full pelage likely did not evolve until the therapsid-mammal transition. The more advanced, smaller therapsids could have had a combination of hair and scutes, a combination still found in some modern mammals, such as rodents and the opossum.

The high interspecific variability of the size, color, and microstructure of hair often enables the identification of species based on single hair filaments.

In varying degrees most mammals have some skin areas without natural hair. On the human body, glabrous skin is found on the ventral portion of the fingers, palms, soles of feet and lips, which are all parts of the body most closely associated with interacting with the world around us, as are the labia minora and glans penis. There are four main types of mechanoreceptors in the glabrous skin of humans: Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner&#x27;s corpuscles, Merkel&#x27;s discs, and Ruffini corpuscles.

The naked mole-rat (&quot;Heterocephalus glaber&quot;) has evolved skin lacking in general, pelagic hair covering, yet has retained long, very sparsely scattered tactile hairs over its body. Glabrousness is a trait that may be associated with neoteny.

===Evolutionary variation===
Primates are relatively hairless compared to other mammals, and Hominini such as chimpanzees, have less dense hair than would be expected given their body size for a primate. Evolutionary biologists suggest that the genus &quot;Homo&quot; arose in East Africa approximately 2 million years ago. Part of this evolution was the development of endurance running and venturing out during the hot times of the day that required efficient thermoregulation through perspiration. The loss of heat through heat of evaporation by means of sweat glands is aided by air currents next to the skin surface, which are facilitated by the loss of body hair.

Another factor in human evolution that also occurred in the prehistoric past was a preferential selection for neoteny, particularly in females. The idea that adult humans exhibit certain neotenous (juvenile) features, not evinced in the other great apes, is about a century old. Louis Bolk made a long list of such traits, and Stephen Jay Gould published a short list in &quot;Ontogeny and Phylogeny&quot;. In addition, paedomorphic characteristics in women are often acknowledged as desirable by men in developed countries. For instance, vellus hair is a juvenile characteristic. However, while men develop longer, coarser, thicker, and darker terminal hair through sexual differentiation, women do not, leaving their vellus hair visible.
===Texture===

====Curly hair====


Jablonski asserts head hair was evolutionarily advantageous for pre-humans to retain because it protected the scalp as they walked upright in the intense African (equatorial) UV light. While some might argue that, by this logic, humans should also express hairy shoulders because these body parts would putatively be exposed to similar conditions, the protection of the head, the seat of the brain that enabled humanity to become one of the most successful species on the planet (and which also is very vulnerable at birth) was arguably a more urgent issue (axillary hair in the underarms and groin were also retained as signs of sexual maturity). Sometime during the gradual process by which &quot;Homo erectus&quot; began a transition from furry skin to the naked skin expressed by &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, hair texture putatively gradually changed from straight hair (the condition of most mammals, including humanity&#x27;s closest cousins—chimpanzees) to Afro-textured hair or &#x27;kinky&#x27; (i.e. tightly coiled). This argument assumes that curly hair better impedes the passage of UV light into the body relative to straight hair (thus curly or coiled hair would be particularly advantageous for light-skinned hominids living at the equator).

It is substantiated by Iyengar&#x27;s findings (1998) that UV light can enter into straight human hair roots (and thus into the body through the skin) via the hair shaft. Specifically, the results of that study suggest that this phenomenon resembles the passage of light through fiber optic tubes (which do not function as effectively when kinked or sharply curved or coiled). In this sense, when hominids (i.e. &quot;Homo erectus&quot;) were gradually losing their straight body hair and thereby exposing the initially pale skin underneath their fur to the sun, straight hair would have been an adaptive liability. By inverse logic, later, as humans traveled farther from Africa and/or the equator, straight hair may have (initially) evolved to aid the entry of UV light into the body during the transition from dark, UV-protected skin to paler skin.

Jablonski&#x27;s assertions suggest that the adjective &quot;woolly&quot; in reference to Afro-hair is a misnomer in connoting the high heat insulation derivable from the true wool of sheep. Instead, the relatively sparse density of Afro-hair, combined with its springy coils actually results in an airy, almost sponge-like structure that in turn, Jablonski argues, more likely facilitates an increase in the circulation of cool air onto the scalp. Further, wet Afro-hair does not stick to the neck and scalp unless totally drenched and instead tends to retain its basic springy puffiness because it less easily responds to moisture and sweat than straight hair does. In this sense, the trait may enhance comfort levels in intense equatorial climates more than straight hair (which, on the other hand, tends to naturally fall over the ears and neck to a degree that provides slightly enhanced comfort levels in cold climates relative to tightly coiled hair).

Further, it is notable that the most pervasive expression of this hair texture can be found in sub-Saharan Africa; a region of the world that abundant genetic and paleo-anthropological evidence suggests, was the relatively recent (≈200,000-year-old) point of origin for modern humanity. In fact, although genetic findings (Tishkoff, 2009) suggest that sub-Saharan Africans are the most genetically diverse continental group on Earth, Afro-textured hair approaches ubiquity in this region. This points to a strong, long-term selective pressure that, in stark contrast to most other regions of the genomes of sub-Saharan groups, left little room for genetic variation at the determining loci. Such a pattern, again, does not seem to support human sexual aesthetics as being the sole or primary cause of this distribution.

==== The EDAR locus ====
A group of studies have recently shown that genetic patterns at the EDAR locus, a region of the modern human genome that contributes to hair texture variation among most individuals of East Asian descent, support the hypothesis that (East Asian) straight hair likely developed in this branch of the modern human lineage subsequent to the original expression of tightly coiled natural afro-hair. Specifically, the relevant findings indicate that the EDAR mutation coding for the predominant East Asian &#x27;coarse&#x27; or thick, straight hair texture arose within the past ≈65,000 years, which is a time frame that covers from the earliest of the &#x27;Out of Africa&#x27; migrations up to now.

==Disease==

Ringworm is a fungal disease that targets hairy skin.

Premature greying of hair is another condition that results in greying before the age of 20 years in Europeans, before 25 years in Asians, and before 30 years in Africans.

== Hair care ==

Hair care involves the hygiene and cosmetology of hair including hair on the scalp, facial hair (beard and moustache), pubic hair and other body hair. Hair care routines differ according to an individual&#x27;s culture and the physical characteristics of one&#x27;s hair. Hair may be colored, trimmed, shaved, plucked, or otherwise removed with treatments such as waxing, sugaring, and threading.

===Removal practices===
Depilation is the removal of hair from the surface of the skin. This can be achieved through methods such as shaving. Epilation is the removal of the entire hair strand, including the part of the hair that has not yet left the follicle. A popular way to epilate hair is through waxing.

====Shaving====
Shaving is accomplished with bladed instruments, such as razors. The blade is brought close to the skin and stroked over the hair in the desired area to cut the terminal hairs and leave the skin feeling smooth. Depending upon the rate of growth, one can begin to feel the hair growing back within hours of shaving. This is especially evident in men who develop a five o&#x27;clock shadow after having shaved their faces. This new growth is called stubble. Stubble typically appears to grow back thicker because the shaved hairs are blunted instead of tapered off at the end, although the hair never actually grows back thicker.

====Waxing====
Waxing involves using a sticky wax and strip of paper or cloth to pull hair from the root. Waxing is the ideal hair removal technique to keep an area hair-free for long periods of time. It can take three to five weeks for waxed hair to begin to resurface again. Hair in areas that have been waxed consistently is known to grow back finer and thinner, especially compared to hair that has been shaved with a razor.

====Laser removal====
Laser hair removal is a cosmetic method where a small laser beam pulses selective heat on dark target matter in the area that causes hair growth without harming the skin tissue. This process is repeated several times over the course of many months to a couple of years with hair regrowing less frequently until it finally stops; this is used as a more permanent solution to waxing or shaving. Laser removal is practiced in many clinics along with many at-home products.

====Cutting and trimming====
Because the hair on one&#x27;s head is normally longer than other types of body hair, it is cut with scissors or clippers. People with longer hair will most often use scissors to cut their hair, whereas shorter hair is maintained using a trimmer. Depending on the desired length and overall health of the hair, periods without cutting or trimming the hair can vary.

Cut hair may be used in wigs. Global imports of hair in 2010 was worth $US 1.24 billion.

==Social role==
Hair has great social significance for human beings. It can grow on most external areas of the human body, except on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (among other areas). Hair is most noticeable on most people in a small number of areas, which are also the ones that are most commonly trimmed, plucked, or shaved. These include the face, ears, head, eyebrows, legs, and armpits, as well as the pubic region. The highly visible differences between male and female body and facial hair are a notable secondary sex characteristic.

The world&#x27;s longest documented hair belongs to Xie Qiuping (in China), at 5.627 m (18 ft 5.54 in) when measured on 8 May 2004. She has been growing her hair since 1973, from the age of 13.

===Indication of status===
Healthy hair indicates health and youth (important in evolutionary biology). Hair color and texture can be a sign of ethnic ancestry. Facial hair is a sign of puberty in men. White or gray hair is a sign of age or genetics, which may be concealed with hair dye (not easily for some), although many prefer to assume it (especially if it is a poliosis characteristic of the person since childhood). Pattern baldness in men is usually seen as a sign of aging that may be concealed with a toupee, hats, or religious and cultural adornments; however, the condition can be triggered by various hormonal factors at any age following puberty and is not uncommon in younger men. Although pattern baldness can be slowed down by drugs such as Finasteride and Minoxidil or treated with hair transplants, many men see this as unnecessary effort for the sake of vanity and instead shave their heads. In early modern China, the queue was a male hairstyle in which the hair at the front and top was shaved every 10 days in a style mimicking pattern baldness, while the remaining hair at the back was braided into a long pigtail.

A hairstyle may be an indicator of group membership. During the English Civil War, followers of Oliver Cromwell cropped their hair close to their head in an act of defiance against the curls and ringlets of the king&#x27;s men, which led to them being nicknamed Roundheads. Recent isotopic analysis of hair is helping to shed further light on sociocultural interaction, giving information on food procurement and consumption in the 19th century. Having bobbed hair was popular among the flappers in the 1920s as a sign of rebellion against traditional roles for women. Female art students known as the Cropheads also adopted the style, notably at the Slade School in London. Regional variations in hirsutism has caused practices regarding hair on the arms and legs to differ. Some religious groups may follow certain rules regarding hair as part of religious observance. The rules often differ for men and women.

Many subcultures have hairstyles which may indicate an unofficial membership. Many hippies, metalheads, and Indian sadhus have long hair, as well many older hipsters. Many punks wear a hairstyle known as a mohawk or other spiked and dyed hairstyles, while skinheads have short-cropped or completely shaved heads. Long stylized bangs were very common for emos, scene kids, and younger hipsters in the 2000s and early 2010s.

Heads were shaved in concentration camps, and head-shaving has been used as punishment, especially for women with long hair. The shaven head is common in military haircuts, while Western monks are known for the tonsure. By contrast, among some Indian holy men, the hair is worn extremely long.

In the time of Confucius (5th century BCE), the Chinese grew out their hair and often tied it, as a symbol of filial piety. Regular hairdressing in some cultures is considered a sign of wealth or status. The dreadlocks of the Rastafari movement were despised early in the movement&#x27;s history. In some cultures, having one&#x27;s hair cut can symbolize a liberation from one&#x27;s past, usually after a trying time in one&#x27;s life. Cutting the hair also may be a sign of mourning.

Tightly coiled hair in its natural state may be worn in an Afro. This hairstyle was once worn among African Americans as a symbol of racial pride. Given that the coiled texture is the natural state of some African Americans&#x27; hair, or perceived as being more &quot;African&quot;, this simple style is now often seen as a sign of self-acceptance and an affirmation that the beauty norms of the (eurocentric) dominant culture are not absolute. African Americans as a whole have a variety of hair textures, as they are not an ethnically homogeneous group, but an ad-hoc of different racial admixtures.

The film &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969) includes the assumption that the two main characters could have their long hairs forcibly shaved with a rusty razor when jailed, symbolizing the intolerance of some conservative groups toward members of the counterculture. At the conclusion of England&#x27;s 1971 &quot;Oz&quot; trials, the defendants had their heads shaved by the police, causing public outcry. During the appeal trial, they appeared in the dock wearing wigs. A case where a 14-year-old student was expelled from school in Brazil in the mid-2000s, allegedly because of his fauxhawk haircut, sparked national debate and legal action resulting in compensation.

===Religious practices===
Women&#x27;s hair may be hidden using headscarves, a common part of the &quot;hijab&quot; in Islam and a symbol of modesty required for certain religious rituals in Eastern Orthodoxy. The Russian Orthodox Church requires all married women to wear headscarves inside the church; this tradition is often extended to all women, regardless of marital status. Orthodox Judaism also commands the use of scarves and other head coverings for married women for modesty reasons. Certain Hindu sects also wear head scarves for religious reasons. Sikhs have an obligation not to cut hair (a Sikh cutting hair becomes &#x27;apostate&#x27; which means fallen from religion) and men keep it tied in a bun on the head, which is then covered appropriately using a turban. Multiple religions, both ancient and contemporary, require or advise one to allow their hair to become dreadlocks, though people also wear them for fashion. For men, Islam, Orthodox Judaism, Orthodox Christianity, Roman Catholicism, and other religious groups have at various times recommended or required the covering of the head and sections of the hair of men, and some have dictates relating to the cutting of men&#x27;s facial and head hair. Some Christian sects throughout history and up to modern times have also religiously proscribed the cutting of women&#x27;s hair. For some Sunni madhabs, the donning of a kufi or topi is a form of sunnah. Brahmin males are prescribed to shave their heads, but leave a tuft of hair unshaved, worn in the form of a topknot.

===In Arabic poetry===
Since ancient times, women&#x27;s long, thick, wavy hair has featured prominently in Arabic poetry. Pre-Islamic poets used only limited imagery to describe women&#x27;s hair. For example, al-A&#x27;sha wrote a verse comparing a lover&#x27;s hair to &quot;a garden whose grapes dangle down upon me&quot;, but Bashshar ibn Burd considered this unusual. One comparison used by early poets, such as Imru al-Qays, was to bunches of dates. In Abbasid times, however, the imagery for hair expanded significantly - particularly for the then-fashionable &quot;love-locks&quot; (&quot;sudgh&quot;) framing the temples, which came into style at the court of the caliph al-Amin. Hair curls were compared to hooks and chains, letters (such as &quot;fa&quot;, &quot;waw&quot;, &quot;lam&quot;, and &quot;nun&quot;), scorpions, annelids, and polo sticks. An example was the poet Ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz, who compared a lock of hair and a birthmark to a polo stick driving a ball.

<text>The Hawker Siddeley Harrier is a British jet-powered attack aircraft designed and produced by the British aerospace company Hawker Siddeley. It was the first operational ground attack and reconnaissance aircraft with vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of its era.

It was the first of the Harrier series of aircraft, being developed directly from the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel prototype aircraft following the cancellation of a more advanced supersonic aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154. In the mid 1960s, the &quot;Harrier GR.1&quot; and &quot;GR.3&quot; variants were ordered by the British government for the Royal Air Force (RAF). The Harrier GR.1 made its first flight on 28 December 1967, and entered RAF service in April 1969. During the 1970s, the United States opted to procure the aircraft as the &quot;AV-8A&quot;; it was operated by the US Marine Corps (USMC).

Introduced to service amid the Cold War, the RAF positioned the bulk of their Harriers across West Germany to defend against a potential invasion of Western Europe by the Warsaw Pact forces; the unique abilities of the Harrier allowed the RAF to disperse their forces away from vulnerable airbases. The USMC used their Harriers primarily for close air support, operating from amphibious assault ships, and, if needed, forward operating bases. Harrier squadrons saw several deployments overseas. Its ability to operate with minimal ground facilities and very short runways allowed it to be used at locations unavailable to other fixed-wing aircraft. The Harrier received criticism for having a high accident rate and for a time-consuming maintenance process.

In the 1970s, the British Aerospace Sea Harrier was developed from the Harrier for use by the Royal Navy (RN) on s. Both the Sea Harrier and the Harrier fought in the 1982 Falklands War, in which the aircraft proved to be crucial and versatile. The RN Sea Harriers provided fixed-wing air defence while the RAF Harriers focused on ground-attack missions in support of the advancing British land force. The Harrier was also extensively redesigned as the AV-8B Harrier II and British Aerospace Harrier II by the team of McDonnell Douglas and British Aerospace. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the first-generation aircraft were gradually replaced by the newer Harrier IIs.

==Development==

===Origins===

The Harrier&#x27;s design was derived from the Hawker P.1127. Prior to developing the P.1127, Hawker Aircraft had been working on a replacement for the Hawker Hunter, the Hawker P.1121. The P.1121 was cancelled after the release of the British Government&#x27;s 1957 Defence White Paper, which advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. This policy resulted in the termination of the majority of aircraft development projects then underway for the British military. Hawker sought to quickly move on to a new project and became interested in Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) aircraft, which did not need runways. According to Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine this interest may have been stimulated by the presence of Air Staff Requirement 345, which sought a V/STOL ground attack fighter for the Royal Air Force.

Design work on the P.1127 was formally started in 1957 by Sir Sydney Camm, Ralph Hooper of Hawker Aircraft, and Stanley Hooker (later Sir Stanley Hooker) of the Bristol Engine Company. The close cooperation between Hawker, the airframe company, and Bristol, the engine company, was viewed by project engineer Gordon Lewis as one of the key factors that allowed the development of the Harrier to continue in spite of technical obstacles and political setbacks. Rather than using rotors or a direct jet thrust, the P.1127 had an innovative vectored thrust turbofan engine, the Pegasus. The Pegasus I was rated at of thrust and first ran in September 1959. A contract for two development prototypes was signed in June 1960 and the first flight followed in October 1960. Of the six prototypes built, three crashed, including one during an air display at the 1963 Paris Air Show.

===Tripartite evaluation===
In 1961, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany jointly agreed to purchase nine aircraft developed from the P.1127, for the evaluation of the performance and potential of V/STOL aircraft. These aircraft were built by Hawker Siddeley and were designated &quot;Kestrel FGA.1&quot; by the UK. The Kestrel was strictly an evaluation aircraft and to save money the Pegasus 5 engine was not fully developed as intended, only having of thrust instead of the projected . The Tripartite Evaluation Squadron numbered ten pilots; four each from the UK and US and two from West Germany. The Kestrel&#x27;s first flight took place on 7 March 1964.

A total of 960 sorties had been made during the trials, including 1,366 takeoffs and landings, by the end of evaluations in November 1965. One aircraft was destroyed in an accident and six others were transferred to the United States, assigned the US designation &quot;XV-6A Kestrel&quot;, and underwent further testing. The two remaining British-based Kestrels were assigned to further trials and experimentation at RAE Bedford with one being modified to use the uprated Pegasus 6 engine.

===P.1154===
At the time of the development of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a supersonic version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to meet a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft. The design used a single Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine with four swivelling nozzles, in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of plenum chamber burning (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds. The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as Dassault Aviation&#x27;s Mirage IIIV. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.

The Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy planned to develop and introduce the supersonic P.1154 independently of the cancelled NATO requirement. This ambition was complicated by the conflicting requirements between the two services—while the RAF wanted a low-level supersonic strike aircraft, the Navy sought a twin-engine air defence fighter. Following the election of the Labour Government of 1964 the P.1154 was cancelled, as the Royal Navy had already begun procurement of the McDonnell Douglas Phantom II and the RAF placed a greater importance on the BAC TSR-2&#x27;s ongoing development. Work continued on elements of the project, such as a supersonic PCB-equipped Pegasus engine, with the intention of developing a future Harrier variant for the decades following cancellation.

===Production===
Following the collapse of the P.1154&#x27;s development the RAF began considering a simple upgrade of the existing subsonic Kestrel and issued Requirement ASR 384 for a V/STOL ground attack jet. Hawker Siddeley received an order for six pre-production aircraft in 1965, designated &quot;P.1127 (RAF)&quot;, of which the first made its maiden flight on 31 August 1966. An order for 60 production aircraft, designated as Harrier GR.1, was received in early 1967. The aircraft was named after the Harrier, a small bird of prey.

The Harrier GR.1 made its first flight on 28 December 1967, and it officially entered service with the RAF on 1 April 1969. The aircraft was built in two factories—one in Kingston upon Thames, southwest London, and the other at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey—and underwent initial testing at Dunsfold. The ski-jump technique for launching Harriers from Royal Navy aircraft carriers was extensively trialled at RNAS Yeovilton from 1977. Following these tests ski-jumps were added to the flight decks of all RN carriers from 1979 onwards, in preparation for the new variant for the navy, the Sea Harrier.

In the late 1960s the British and American governments held talks on producing Harriers in the United States. Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas formed a partnership in 1969 in preparation for American production, but Congressman Mendel Rivers and the House Appropriations Committee held that it would be cheaper to produce the AV-8A on the pre-existing production lines in the United Kingdom—hence all AV-8A Harriers were purchased from Hawker Siddeley. Improved Harrier versions with better sensors and more powerful engines were developed in later years. The USMC received 102 AV-8A and 8 TAV-8A Harriers between 1971 and 1976.
==Design==

===Overview===
The Harrier was typically used as a ground attack aircraft, though its manoeuvrability also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges. The Harrier is powered by a single Pegasus turbofan engine mounted in the fuselage. The engine is fitted with two air intakes and four vectoring nozzles for directing the thrust generated: two for the bypass flow and two for the jet exhaust. Several small reaction nozzles are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, for the purpose of balancing during vertical flight. It has two landing gear units on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gear units, one near each wing tip. The Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying a variety of weapons and external fuel tanks.
The Kestrel and the Harrier were similar in appearance, though approximately 90 per cent of the Kestrel&#x27;s airframe was redesigned for the Harrier. The Harrier was powered by the more powerful Pegasus 6 engine; new air intakes with auxiliary blow-in doors were added to produce the required airflow at low speed. Its wing was modified to increase area and the landing gear was strengthened. Several hardpoints were installed, two under each wing and one underneath the fuselage; two ADEN cannon gun pods could also be fitted to the underside of the fuselage. The Harrier was outfitted with updated avionics to replace the basic systems used in the Kestrel; a navigational-attack system incorporating an inertial navigation system, originally for the P.1154, was installed and information was presented to the pilot by a head-up display and a moving map display.

The Harrier&#x27;s VTOL abilities allowed it to be deployed from very small prepared clearings or helipads as well as normal airfields. It was believed that, in a high-intensity conflict, air bases would be vulnerable and likely to be quickly knocked out. The capability to scatter Harrier squadrons to dozens of small &quot;alert pads&quot; on the front lines was highly prized by military strategists and the USMC procured the aircraft because of this ability. Hawker Siddeley noted that STOL operation provided additional benefits over VTOL operation, saving fuel and allowing the aircraft to carry more ordnance.

The Harrier, while serving for many decades in various forms, has been criticised on multiple issues; in particular a high accident rate, though Nordeen notes that several conventional single-engine strike aircraft like the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and LTV A-7 Corsair II had worse accident rates. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported in 2003 that the Harrier &quot;...has amassed the highest major accident rate of any military plane now in service. Forty-five Marines have died in 148 noncombat accidents&quot;. Colonel Lee Buland of the USMC declared the maintenance of a Harrier to be a &quot;challenge&quot;; the need to remove the wings before performing most work upon the engine, including engine replacements, meant the Harrier required considerable man-hours in maintenance, more than most aircraft. Buland noted however that the maintenance difficulties were unavoidable in order to create a V/STOL aircraft.

===Engine===

The Pegasus turbofan jet engine, developed in tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus turbofan engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine&#x27;s thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles. The engine is equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. Water injection was necessary in order to generate maximum thrust, if only for a limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.

The aircraft was initially powered by the Pegasus 6 engine which was replaced by the more powerful Pegasus 11 during the Harrier GR.1 to GR.3 upgrade process. The primary focus throughout the engine&#x27;s development was on achieving high performance with as little weight as possible, tempered by the amount of funding that was available. Following the Harrier&#x27;s entry to service the focus switched to improving reliability and extending engine life; a formal joint US–UK Pegasus Support Program operated for many years and spent a £3-million annual budget to develop engine improvements. Several variants have been released; the latest is the Pegasus 11–61 (Mk 107), which provides 23,800 lbf (106 kN) thrust, more than any previous engine.

===Controls and handling===

The Harrier has been described by pilots as &quot;unforgiving&quot;. The aircraft is capable of both forward flight (where it behaves in the manner of a typical fixed-wing aircraft above its stall speed), as well as VTOL and STOL manoeuvres (where the traditional lift and control surfaces are useless) requiring skills and technical knowledge usually associated with helicopters. Most services demand great aptitude and extensive training for Harrier pilots, as well as experience in piloting both types of aircraft. Trainee pilots are often drawn from highly experienced and skilled helicopter pilots.

In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling the direction of the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft&#x27;s vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.

The Harrier has two control elements not found in conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.

The wind direction is a critical factor in VTOL manoeuvres. The procedure for vertical takeoff involves facing the aircraft into the wind. The thrust vector is set to 90° and the throttle is brought up to maximum, at which point the aircraft leaves the ground. The throttle is trimmed until a hover state is achieved at the desired altitude. The short-takeoff procedure involves proceeding with normal takeoff and then applying a thrust vector (less than 90°) at a runway speed below normal takeoff speed; usually the point of application is around . For lower takeoff speeds the thrust vector is greater. The reaction control system involves a thrusters at key points in the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage and nose, also the wingtips. Thrust from the engine can be temporarily syphoned to control and correct the aircraft&#x27;s pitch and roll during vertical flight.

Rotating the vectored thrust nozzles into a forward-facing position during normal flight is called vectoring in forward flight, or &quot;VIFFing&quot;. This is a dog-fighting tactic, allowing for more sudden braking and higher turn rates. Braking could cause a chasing aircraft to overshoot and present itself as a target for the Harrier it was chasing, a combat technique formally developed by the USMC for the Harrier in the early 1970s.

===Differences between versions===
The two largest users of the Harrier were the Royal Air Force and the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The exported model of the aircraft operated by the USMC was designated the AV-8A Harrier, which was broadly similar to the RAF&#x27;s Harrier GR.1. Changes included the removal of all magnesium components, which corroded quickly at sea, and the integration of American radios and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems; furthermore the outer pylons, unlike the RAF aircraft, were designed from delivery to be equipped with self-defence AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking air-to-air missiles. Most of the AV-8As had been delivered with the more powerful Pegasus engine used in the GR.3 instead of the one used in the earlier GR.1. Two-seat Harriers were operated for training purposes; the body was stretched and a taller tail fin added. The RAF trained in the T.2 and T.4 versions, while T.4N and T.8 were training versions the Navy&#x27;s Sea Harrier, with appropriate fittings. The US and Spain flew the TAV-8A and TAV-8S, respectively.

All RAF GR.1s and the initial AV-8As were fitted with the Ferranti FE541 inertial navigation/attack suite, but these were replaced in the USMC Harriers by a simpler Interface/Weapon Aiming Computer to aid quick turnaround between missions. The Martin-Baker ejection seats were also replaced by the Stencel SEU-3A in the American aircraft. The RAF had their GR.1 aircraft upgraded to the GR.3 standard, which featured improved sensors, a nose-mounted laser tracker, the integration of electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems and a further upgraded Pegasus Mk 103. The USMC upgraded their AV-8As to the AV-8C configuration; this programme involved the installation of ECM equipment and adding a new inertial navigation system to the aircraft&#x27;s avionics. Substantial changes were the Lift Improvement Devices, to increase VTOL performance; at the same time several airframe components were restored or replaced to extend the life of the aircraft. Spain&#x27;s Harriers, designated AV-8S or VA.1 Matador for the single-seater and TAV-8S or VAE.1 for the two-seater, were almost identical to USMC Harriers differing only in the radios fitted.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm (FAA) operated a substantially modified variant of the Harrier, the British Aerospace Sea Harrier. The Sea Harrier was intended for multiple naval roles and was equipped with radar and Sidewinder missiles for air combat duties as part of fleet air defence. The Sea Harrier was also fitted with navigational aids for carrier landings, modifications to reduce corrosion by seawater and a raised bubble-canopy covered cockpit for better visibility. The aircraft were later equipped to use AIM-120 AMRAAM beyond-visual-range anti-aircraft missiles and the more advanced Blue Vixen radar for longer range air-to-air combat, as well as Sea Eagle missiles for conducting anti-ship missions.

The McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II is the latest Harrier variant, a second-generation series to replace the first generation of Harrier jets already in service; all the above variants of the Harrier have mainly been retired with the Harrier II taking their place in the RAF, USMC and FAA. In the 1970s the United Kingdom considered two options for replacing their existing Harriers: joining McDonnell Douglas (MDC) in developing the BAE Harrier II, or the independent development of a &quot;Big Wing&quot; Harrier. This proposal would have increased the wing area from , allowing for significant increases in weapons load and internal fuel reserves. The option of cooperation with MDC was chosen in 1982 over the more risky isolated approach. The original Harrier served as the basis for the British Aerospace Sea Harrier as it was required to fill the fighter role.

==Operational history==

===Royal Air Force===
The first RAF squadron to be equipped with the Harrier GR.1, No. 1 Squadron, started to convert to the aircraft at RAF Wittering in April 1969. An early demonstration of the Harrier&#x27;s capabilities was the participation of two aircraft in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; Transatlantic Air Race in May 1969, flying between St Pancras railway station, London and central Manhattan with the use of aerial refuelling. The overall journey between the Post Office Tower and Empire State Building took 6 hours 11 minutes; the Harrier had a flight time of 5 hours 57 minutes. Two Harrier squadrons were established in 1970 at the RAF&#x27;s air base in Wildenrath to be part of its air force in Germany; another squadron was formed there two years later. In 1977, these three squadrons were moved forward to the air base at Gütersloh, closer to the prospective front line in the event of an outbreak of a European war. One of the squadrons was disbanded and its aircraft distributed between the other two.
In RAF service, the Harrier was used in close air support (CAS), reconnaissance, and other ground-attack roles. The flexibility of the Harrier led to a long-term heavy deployment in West Germany as a conventional deterrent and potential strike weapon against Soviet aggression; from camouflaged rough bases the Harrier was expected to launch attacks on advancing armour columns from East Germany. Harriers were also deployed to bases in Norway and Belize, a former British colony. No. 1 Squadron was specifically earmarked for Norwegian operations in the event of war, operating as part of Allied Forces Northern Europe. The Harrier&#x27;s capabilities were necessary in the Belize deployment, as it was the only RAF combat aircraft capable of safely operating from the airport&#x27;s short runway; British forces had been stationed in Belize for several years due to tensions over a Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory; the forces were withdrawn in 1993, two years after Guatemala recognized the independence of Belize.

In the Falklands War () in 1982, 10 Harrier GR.3s of No. 1 Squadron operated from the aircraft carrier . As the RAF Harrier GR.3 had not been designed for naval service, the 10 aircraft had to be rapidly modified prior to the departure of the task force. Special sealants against corrosion were applied and a new deck-based inertial guidance aid was devised to allow the RAF Harrier to land on a carrier as easily as the Sea Harrier. Transponders to guide aircraft back to the carriers during night-time operations were also installed, along with flares and chaff dispensers.

As there was little space on the carriers, two requisitioned merchant container ships, and , were modified with temporary flight decks and used to carry Harriers and helicopters to the South Atlantic. The Harrier GR.3s focused on providing close air support to the ground forces on the Falklands and attacking Argentine positions; suppressing enemy artillery was often a high priority. Sea Harriers were also used in the war, primarily conducting fleet air defence and combat air patrols against the threat of attacking Argentine fighters. However, both Sea Harriers and Harrier GR.3s were used in ground-attack missions against the main airfield and runway at Stanley.

If most of the Sea Harriers had been lost, the GR.3s would have replaced them in air patrol duties, even though the Harrier GR.3 was not designed for air defence operations; as such the GR.3s quickly had their outboard weapons pylons modified to take air-to-air Sidewinder missiles. From 10 to 24 May 1982, prior to British forces landing in the Falklands, a detachment of three GR.3s provided air defence for Ascension Island until three F-4 Phantom IIs arrived to take on this responsibility. During the Falklands War, the greatest threats to the Harriers were deemed to be surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and small arms fire from the ground. In total, four Harrier GR.3s and six Sea Harriers were lost to ground fire, accidents, or mechanical failure. More than 2,000 Harrier sorties were conducted during the conflict—equivalent to six sorties per day per aircraft.
Following the Falklands War, British Aerospace explored the Skyhook, a new technique to operate Harriers from smaller ships. Skyhook would have allowed the launching and landing of Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re-arming. This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas. The system was marketed to foreign customers, and it was speculated that Skyhook could be applied to large submarines such as the Russian , but the system attracted no interest.

The first generation of Harriers did not see further combat with the RAF after the Falklands War, although they continued to serve for years afterwards. As a deterrent against further Argentine invasion attempts, No. 1453 Flight RAF was deployed to the Falkland Islands from August 1983 to June 1985. However the second generation Harrier IIs saw action in Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The first generation Hawker Siddeley airframes were replaced by the improved Harrier II, which had been developed jointly between McDonnell Douglas and British Aerospace.

===United States Marine Corps===
The United States Marine Corps began showing a significant interest in the aircraft around the time the first RAF Harrier squadron was established in 1969, and this motivated Hawker Siddeley to further develop the aircraft to encourage a purchase. Although there were concerns in Congress about multiple coinciding projects in the close air support role, the Marine Corps were enthusiastic about the Harrier and managed to overcome efforts to obstruct its procurement.

The Marine Corps accepted its first AV-8A on 6 January 1971, at Dunsfold Aerodrome, England and began testing it at Naval Air Station Patuxent River on 26 January. The AV-8A entered service with the Marine Corps in 1971, replacing other aircraft in the Marines&#x27; attack squadrons. The service became interested in performing ship-borne operations with the Harrier. Admiral Elmo Zumwalt promoted the concept of a Sea Control Ship, a 15,000-ton light carrier equipped with Harriers and helicopters, to supplement the larger aircraft carriers of the US Navy. An amphibious assault ship, , was converted into the &quot;Interim Sea Control Ship&quot; and operated as such between 1971 and 1973 with the purpose of studying the limits and possible obstacles for operating such a vessel. Since then the Sea Control Ship concept has been subject to periodic re-examinations and studies, often in the light of budget cuts and questions over the use of supercarriers.
Other exercises were performed to demonstrate the AV-8A&#x27;s suitability for operating from various amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers, including a deployment of 14 Harriers aboard for six months in 1976. The tests showed, amongst other things, that the Harrier was capable of performing in weather where conventional carrier aircraft could not. In support of naval operations, the USMC devised and studied several methods to further integrate the Harrier. One result was &quot;Arapaho&quot;, a stand-by system to rapidly convert civilian cargo ships into seagoing platforms for operating and maintaining a handful of Harriers, to be used to augment the number of available ships to deploy upon.

When the reactivation of the s was under consideration, a radical design for a battleship-carrier hybrid emerged that would have replaced the ship&#x27;s rear turret with a flight deck, complete with a hangar and two ski jumps, for operating several Harriers. However, the USMC considered the need for naval gunfire support to be a greater priority than additional platforms for carrier operations, while the cost and delay associated with such elaborate conversions was significant, and the concept was dropped.

The Marines Corps&#x27; concept for deploying the Harriers in a land-based expeditionary role focused on aggressive speed. Harrier forward bases and light maintenance facilities were to be set up in under 24 hours on any prospective battle area. The forward bases, containing one to four aircraft, were to be located from the forward edge of battle (FEBA), while a more established permanent airbase would be located around from the FEBA. The close proximity of forward bases allowed for a far greater sortie rate and reduced fuel consumption.
The AV-8A&#x27;s abilities in air-to-air combat were tested by the Marine Corps by conducting mock dogfights with McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs; these exercises trained pilots to use the vectoring-in-forward-flight (VIFF) capability to outmanoeuvre their opponents and showed that the Harriers could act as effective air-to-air fighters at close range. The success of Harrier operations countered scepticism of V/STOL aircraft, which had been judged to be expensive failures in the past. Marine Corps officers became convinced of the military advantages of the Harrier and pursued extensive development of the aircraft.

Starting in 1979, the USMC began upgrading their AV-8As to the AV-8C configuration—the work focused mainly on extending useful service lives and improving VTOL performance. The AV-8C and the remaining AV-8A Harriers were retired by 1987. These were replaced by the Harrier II, designated as the AV-8B, which was introduced into service in 1985. The performance of the Harrier in USMC service led to calls for the United States Air Force to procure Harrier IIs in addition to the USMC&#x27;s own plans, but these never resulted in Air Force orders. Since the late 1990s, the AV-8B has been slated to be replaced by the F-35B variant of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, a more modern V/STOL jet aircraft.

Like the next generation AV-8Bs, nevertheless, the AV-8A/C Harriers suffered many accidents, with around 40 aircraft lost and some 30 pilots killed during the 1970s and 1980s.

===Other operators===
Due to the Harrier&#x27;s unique characteristics it attracted a large amount of interest from other nations, often as attempts to make their own V/STOL jets were unsuccessful, such as in the cases of the American XV-4 Hummingbird and the German VFW VAK 191B. Operations by the USMC aboard in 1981 and by British Harriers and Sea Harriers in the Falklands War proved that the aircraft was highly effective in combat. These operations also demonstrated that &quot;Harrier Carriers&quot; provided a powerful presence at sea without the expense of big deck carriers.

Following the display of Harrier operations from small carriers, the navies of Spain and later Thailand bought the Harrier for use as their main carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft. Spain&#x27;s purchase of Harriers was complicated by long-standing political friction between the British and Spanish governments of the era; even though the Harriers were manufactured in the UK they were sold to Spain with the US acting as an intermediary. During tests in November 1972, the British pilot John Farley showed that the wooden deck of their aircraft carrier was able to withstand the temperature of the gases generated by the Harrier. Since 1976, the Spanish Navy operated the AV-8S Matador from their aircraft carrier &quot;Dédalo&quot;; the aircraft provided both air defence and strike capabilities for the Spanish fleet. Spain later purchased five Harriers directly from the British government mainly to replace losses.

Spain sold seven single-seat and two twin-seat Harriers to Thailand in 1998. The Royal Thai Navy&#x27;s AV-8S Matadors were delivered as part of the air wing deployed on the new light aircraft carrier . The Thai Navy had from the start significant logistical problems keeping the Harriers operational due to a shortage of funds for spare parts and equipment, leaving only a few Harriers serviceable at a time. In 1999, two years after being delivered, only one airframe was in airworthy condition. Around 2003, Thailand considered acquiring former Royal Navy Sea Harriers, which were more suitable for maritime operations and better equipped for air defence, to replace their AV-8S Harriers; this investigation did not progress to a purchase. The last first-generation Harriers were retired by Thailand in 2006.
=== Potential operators ===
Some countries almost purchased Harriers. British Aerospace held talks with Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Switzerland and Japan.

==== Argentina ====
When the Argentinian Navy looked for newer fighters in 1968 the US government only offered old A-4A planes instead of the A-4Fs Argentina wanted. Argentina contacted the British government in 1969 and expressed interest in buying from six to twelve Harrier GR.1s. In 1969 the Argentinian Navy received its second carrier, ARA &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot;, from the Netherlands. On her voyage home, Hawker Siddeley demonstrated a RAF Harrier GR.Mk.1 (XV757) but Argentina opted for the A-4Q Skyhawk instead. There were several problems to supply Argentina with Harrier jets and engines that prevented the deal from being closed, and when the US learned of the Harrier negotiations they quickly offered a better deal to Argentina. Some years later, before the 1982 war, British officials again offered Argentina an aircraft carrier and Sea Harrier aircraft.

==== Australia ====
Planning for a &quot;HMAS Melbourne&quot; aircraft carrier replacement began in 1981. After considering American, Italian, and Spanish designs, the Australian government accepted a British offer to sell , which would be operated with Harriers and helicopters. However, the Royal Navy withdrew the offer after the Falklands War, and the 1983 election of the Australian Labor Party led to the cancellation of plans to replace &quot;Melbourne&quot;.

==== China ====
As early as 1972 the Chinese government started negotiating a purchase of up to 200 Harrier aircraft. Due to internal political issues, China put the negotiations on hold. In 1977 Li Chiang, the Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade, visited the UK and British Aerospace organised a Harrier flying demonstration. In November 1978, the Harrier-demonstration was repeated for the Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Chen during his UK visit. The Harrier deal would have meant British Government ignored United States laws that prohibited such sales to communist countries. British Prime Minister James Callaghan noted significant hostility from the USSR over the sales bid. In spite of that, British Aerospace convinced China that the Harrier was an effective close-support fighter and was good enough to act in a defensive role. In 1979, the Anglo-Sino deal was nearly finalised before being cancelled by the Sino-Vietnamese War.

==== Switzerland ====
The Swiss Air Force was interested in purchasing some Harriers as its doctrine was to operate in hidden and dispersed locations during the Cold War. British Aerospace held talks with Switzerland offering AV-8s to replace De Havilland Venoms. A demonstration was made by test pilot John Farley and XV742/G-VSTO in 1971.

<text>The Hawker Harrier was a British experimental biplane torpedo bomber aircraft built by Hawker Aircraft to a specification issued in the 1920s for the Royal Air Force.

==Development==
In 1925, the British Air Ministry laid down specifications for a high altitude bomber to replace the Hawker Horsley and for a coastal torpedo bomber (Specifications 23/25 and 24/25). As these specifications were similar, the Air Ministry announced that a single competition would be held to study aircraft submitted for both specifications.

Sydney Camm of Hawker Aircraft designed the Harrier to meet the requirements of Specification 23/25, with the prototype (&quot;J8325&quot;) first flying in February 1927, the first of the competitors for the two specifications to fly. The Harrier was a two-seat biplane with single-bay wings powered by a geared Bristol Jupiter VIII radial engine. It was armed with one .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun and one .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis gun carrying a maximum of of bombs.

The prototype Harrier was tested at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A &amp; AEE) at Martlesham Heath in November 1927, where, while it met the requirements of Specification 23/25 and had satisfactory handling, the geared engine meant that it was underpowered, and it had an inferior bombload to the Hawker Horsley, the aircraft it was meant to replace. It was therefore modified to carry a torpedo. On testing the modified aircraft, however, it was found to still be underpowered, being incapable of taking off with a torpedo, gunner and full fuel load. It was therefore not considered further, the competition ultimately being won by the Vickers Vildebeest.

The prototype was used by Bristol as an engine testbed, flying with the Bristol Hydra and the Bristol Orion engines.

<doc id="14317" wikidata="Q52985" url="?curid=14317" title="Hergé">
<text>Georges Prosper Remi (; 22 May 1907 – 3 March 1983), known by the pen name Hergé ( , ), from the French pronunciation of his reversed initials &quot;RG&quot;, was a Belgian comic strip artist. He is best known for creating &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, &quot;Quick &amp; Flupke&quot; (1930–1940) and &quot;The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko&quot; (1936–1957). His works were executed in his distinctive &quot;ligne claire&quot; drawing style.

Born to a lower-middle-class family in Etterbeek, Brussels, Hergé began his career by contributing illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, &quot;The Adventures of Totor&quot;, for &quot;Le Boy-Scout Belge&quot; in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot;, he created &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; in 1929 on the advice of its editor Norbert Wallez. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, the series&#x27; early instalments – &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, and &quot;Tintin in America&quot; – were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Hergé continuing the series and also developing both the &quot;Quick &amp; Flupke&quot; and &quot;Jo, Zette and Jocko&quot; series for &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot;. Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren, from 1934 Hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; onward. Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940, &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot; was closed, but Hergé continued his series in &quot;Le Soir&quot;, a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.

After the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, &quot;Le Soir&quot; was shut down and its staff – including Hergé – accused of having been collaborators. An official investigation was launched, and although no charges were brought against Hergé, in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator. With Raymond Leblanc he established &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine in 1946, through which he serialised new &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; stories. As the magazine&#x27;s artistic director, he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series, such as Edgar P. Jacobs&#x27; &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot;. In 1950 he established Studios Hergé as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects; prominent staff members Jacques Martin and Bob de Moor greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. Amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage, he produced &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, his personal favourite of his works. In later years he became less prolific, and unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as an abstract artist.

Hergé&#x27;s works have been widely acclaimed for their clarity of draughtsmanship and meticulous, well-researched plots. They have been the source of a wide range of adaptations, in theatre, radio, television, cinema, and computer gaming. He remains a strong influence on the comic book medium, particularly in Europe. He is widely celebrated in Belgium: a Hergé Museum was established in Louvain-la-Neuve in 2009.

== Early life ==
=== Childhood and youth: 1907–1925 ===

Georges Prosper Remi was born on 22 May 1907 in his parental home in Etterbeek, a central suburb in Brussels, the capital city of Belgium. His was a lower-middle-class family. His Walloon father, Alexis Remi, worked in a confectionery factory, whilst his Flemish mother, Elisabeth Dufour, was a housewife. Married on 18 January 1905, they moved into a house at 25 rue Cranz (now 33 rue Philippe Baucq), where Georges was born, although a year later they moved to a house at 34 rue de Theux. His primary language was his father&#x27;s French, but growing up in the bilingual Brussels, he also learned Dutch, developing a Marollien accent from his maternal grandmother. A younger brother, Paul, was born five years after Georges. Like most Belgians, his family belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, though they were not particularly devout. He later characterised his life in Etterbeek as dominated by a monochrome grey, considering it extremely boring. Biographer Benoît Peeters suggested that this childhood melancholy might have been exacerbated through being sexually abused by a maternal uncle, Charles Arthur Dufour.

Remi developed a love of cinema, favouring Winsor McCay&#x27;s &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; and the films of Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from them in style and content. Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and US authors, such as &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, as well as the novels of Frenchman Alexandre Dumas. Drawing as a hobby, he sketched out scenes from daily life along the edges of his school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of primary schooling at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with World War I, during which Brussels was occupied by the German army. In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in Ixelles, but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests. Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 at the top of his class.

Aged 12, Remi joined the Boy Scout brigade attached to Saint-Boniface School, becoming troop leader of the Squirrel Patrol and earning the name &quot;Curious Fox&quot; (&quot;Renard curieux&quot;). With the Scouts, he travelled to summer camps in Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Spain, and in the summer of 1923 his troop hiked 200 miles across the Pyrenees. His experiences with Scouting would have a significant influence on the rest of his life, sparking his love of camping and the natural world, and providing him with a moral compass that stressed personal loyalty and keeping one&#x27;s promises.

His Scoutmaster, Rene Weverbergh, encouraged his artistic ability, and published one of Remi&#x27;s drawings in the newsletter of the Saint-Boniface Scouts, &quot;Jamais Assez&quot; (&quot;Never Enough&quot;): his first published work. When Weverbergh became involved in the publication of &quot;Boy-Scout&quot;, the newsletter of the Federation of Scouts, he published more of Remi&#x27;s illustrations, the first of which appeared in the fifth issue, from 1922. Remi continued publishing cartoons, drawings and woodcuts in subsequent issues of the newsletter, which was soon renamed &quot;Le Boy-Scout Belge&quot; (&quot;The Belgian Boy Scout&quot;). During this time, he experimented with different pseudonyms, using &quot;Jérémie&quot; and &quot;Jérémiades&quot; before settling on &quot;Hergé&quot;, the French pronunciation of his reversed initials (R.G.) His work was first published under this name in December 1924.

=== &quot;Totor&quot; and early career: 1925–1928 ===

Alongside his stand-alone illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began production of a comic strip for &quot;Le Boy-Scout Belge&quot;, &quot;Les Aventures de Totor&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of Totor&quot;), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech balloons. Illustrations were also published in &quot;Le Blé qui lève&quot; (&quot;The Wheat That Grows&quot;) and other publications of the (&quot;Action catholique de la jeunesse belge&quot;), and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Soul of the Sea&quot;. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived &quot;Atelier de la Fleur de Lys&quot; (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.

After graduating from secondary school in 1925, Hergé enrolled in the École Saint-Luc art school, but finding the teaching boring, he left after one lesson. He hoped for a job as an illustrator alongside Ickx at &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot; (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;) – a conservative &quot;Catholic Newspaper of Doctrine and Information&quot; – but no positions were available. Instead he got a job in the paper&#x27;s subscriptions department, starting in September 1925. Despising the boredom of this position, he enlisted for military service before he was called up, and in August 1926 was assigned to the Dailly barracks at Schaerbeek. Joining the first infantry regiment, he was also bored by his military training, but continued sketching and producing episodes of &quot;Totor&quot;.

Toward the end of his military service, in August 1927, Hergé met the editor of &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot;, the Abbé Norbert Wallez, a vocal fascist who kept a signed photograph of the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini on his desk. Impressed by Hergé&#x27;s repertoire, Wallez agreed to give him a job as a photographic reporter and cartoonist for the paper, something for which Hergé always remained grateful, coming to view the Abbé as a father figure. Supplemented by commissions for other publications, Hergé illustrated a number of texts for &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; and the literary pages; the illustrations of this period show his interest in woodcuts and the early prototype of his &quot;ligne claire&quot; style.

=== Founding &quot;Tintin&quot; and &quot;Quick &amp; Flupke&quot;: 1929–1932 ===
Beginning a series of newspaper supplements in late 1928, Wallez founded a supplement for children, &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; (&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;), which subsequently appeared in &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot; every Thursday. Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly anti-semitic. For this new venture, Hergé illustrated &quot;L&#x27;Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet&quot; (&quot;The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet&quot;), a comic strip authored by one of the paper&#x27;s sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig. Hergé was unsatisfied, and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium – such as the systematic use of speech bubbles – found in such US comics as George McManus&#x27; &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, George Herriman&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; and Rudolph Dirks&#x27;s &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper&#x27;s reporter Léon Degrelle, stationed there to report on the Cristero War.

Hergé developed a character named Tintin as a Belgian boy reporter who could travel the world with his fox terrier, Snowy – &quot;Milou&quot; in the original French – basing him in large part on his earlier character of Totor and also on his own brother, Paul. Degrelle later falsely claimed that Tintin had been based on him, while he and Hergé fell out when Degrelle used one of his designs without permission; they settled out-of-court. Although Hergé wanted to send his character to the United States, Wallez instead ordered him to set his adventure in the Soviet Union, acting as a work of anti-socialist propaganda for children. The result, &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, began serialisation in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; on 10 January 1929, and ran until 8 May 1930. Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organized a publicity stunt at the Gare de Nord station, following which he organized the publication of the story in book form. The popularity of the story led to an increase in sales, and so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants, Eugène Van Nyverseel and Paul &quot;Jam&quot; Jamin.

In January 1930, Hergé introduced &quot;Quick &amp; Flupke&quot; (&quot;Quick et Flupke&quot;), a new comic strip about two street kids from Brussels, in the pages of &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;. At Wallez&#x27;s direction, in June he began serialisation of the second Tintin adventure, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it would be accused of racism; however, at the time it was un-controversial and popular, with further publicity stunts held to increase sales. For the third adventure, &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, serialised from September 1931 to October 1932, Hergé finally got to deal with a scenario of his own choice, although he used the work to push an anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper&#x27;s ultra-conservative ideology. Although the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; had been serialised in the French Catholic &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot; (&quot;Brave Hearts&quot;) since 1930, he was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers too. Though wealthier than most Belgians at his age, and despite increasing success, he remained an unfazed &quot;conservative young man&quot; dedicated to his work.

Hergé sought work elsewhere too, creating &quot;The Lovable Mr. Mops&quot; cartoon for the Bon Marché department store, and &quot;The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel Out West&quot; for the rival L&#x27;Innovation department store.

=== First marriage ===

At the offices of in 1928, Hergé met the woman who would become his first wife, Germaine Kieckens (1906 – 26 October 1995). A redhead described by Pierre Assouline as &quot;elegant and popular&quot;, she had obtained work as the secretary for Norbert Wallez. At the time of her birth, her parents were relatively elderly and, having lost an earlier child, they were particularly overprotective of her. Greatly admiring Wallez, whom she looked up to as a father figure, she adopted his fascist political beliefs. She was appointed editor of , a supplement for women for which Hergé sometimes drew the cover. She also began writing articles for using the pseudonym Tantine. The first 500 copies of &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; were numbered and signed by Hergé using Tintin&#x27;s signature, with Snowy&#x27;s paw print being drawn next to it by Kieckens.

In 1930, Hergé escorted her home from work almost every night, though she expressed little romantic interest in him at the time. Instead she desired an older, or more mature man, such as the Abbé himself. Wallez however encouraged the two to enter into a relationship, and one evening at the Taverne du Palace she indicated to Hergé that she would be interested in a relationship.

On 20 July 1932 Hergé and Kieckens were married; although neither of them was entirely happy with the union, they had been encouraged to do so by Wallez, who insisted that all his single staff married and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony at the Saint-Roch Church in Laeken. Spending their honeymoon in Vianden, Luxembourg, the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, Schaerbeek.

== Rising fame ==
=== &quot;Tintin in the Orient&quot; and &quot;Jo, Zette &amp; Jocko&quot;: 1932–1939 ===

In November 1932 Hergé announced that the following month he would send Tintin on an adventure to Asia. Although initially titled &quot;The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter, in the Orient&quot;, it would later be renamed &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;. A mystery story, the plot began in Egypt before proceeding to Arabia and India, during which the recurring characters of Thomson and Thompson and Rastapopoulos were introduced. Through his friend Charles Lesne, Hergé was hired to produce illustrations for the company Casterman, and in late 1933 they proposed taking over the publication of both &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and &quot;Quick and Flupke&quot; in book form, to which Hergé agreed; the first Casterman book was the collected volume of &quot;Cigars&quot;. Continuing to subsidise his comic work with commercial advertising, in January 1934 he also founded the &quot;Atelier Hergé&quot; advertising company with two partners, but it was liquidated after six months.

After Wallez was removed from the paper&#x27;s editorship in August 1933 following a scandal, Hergé became despondent; in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;.

From February to August 1934 Hergé serialised &quot;Popol Out West&quot; in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;, a story using animal characters that was a development of the earlier &quot;Tim the Squirrel&quot; comic.

From August 1934 to October 1935, &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; serialised Tintin&#x27;s next adventure, &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, which was set in China and dealt with the recent Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Hergé had been greatly influenced in the production of the work by his friend Zhang Chongren, a Catholic Chinese student studying at Brussels&#x27; Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts, to whom he had been introduced in May 1934. Zhang gave him lessons in Taoist philosophy, Chinese art and Chinese calligraphy, influencing not only his artistic style, but also his general outlook on life. As a token of appreciation Hergé added a fictional &quot;Chang Chong-Chen&quot; to &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, a young Chinese boy who meets and befriends Tintin. For &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, Hergé devoted far more attention to accuracy, resulting in a largely realistic portrayal of China. As a result, &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; has been widely hailed as &quot;Hergé&#x27;s first masterpiece&quot; and a benchmark in the series&#x27; development. Casterman published it in book form, also insisting that Hergé include colour plates in both the volume and in reprints of &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Cigars&quot;. In 1936, they also began production of Tintin merchandise, something Hergé supported, having ideas of an entire shop devoted to &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, something that would come to fruition 50 years later. Nevertheless, while his serialised comics proved lucrative, the collected volumes sold less well, something Hergé blamed on Casterman, urging them to do more to market his books.
Hergé&#x27;s next Tintin story, &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; (1935–1937), was the first for which the plot synopsis had been outlined from the start, being a detective story that took Tintin to South America. It introduced the character of General Alcazar, and also saw Hergé introduce the first fictional countries into the series, San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico, two republics based largely on Bolivia and Paraguay. The violent elements within &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; upset the publishers of &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot;, who asked Hergé to create a more child-appropriate story for them. The result was &quot;The Adventures of Jo, Zette, and Jocko&quot;, a series about a young brother and sister, plus their pet monkey and the parents. The series began with &quot;The Secret Ray&quot;, which was serialised in &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot; and then &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;, and continued with &quot;The Stratoship H-22&quot; and finally &quot;The Valley of the Cobras&quot;. Hergé nevertheless disliked the series, commenting that the characters &quot;bored me terribly.&quot; Now writing three series simultaneously, Hergé was working every day of the year, and felt stressed.

The next Tintin adventure was &quot;The Black Island&quot; (1937–1938), which saw the character travel to Britain to battle counterfeiters and introduced a new antagonist, the German Dr. Müller. Hergé followed this with &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; (1938–1939), in which Tintin saves the fictional Eastern European country of Syldavia from being invaded by its expansionist neighbour, Borduria; the event was an anti-fascist satire of Nazi Germany&#x27;s expansion into Austria and Czechoslovakia. In May 1939, Hergé moved to a new house in Watermael-Boitsfort, although following the German invasion of Poland, he was conscripted into the Belgian army and temporarily stationed in Herenthout. Demobbed within the month, he returned to Brussels and adopted a more explicit anti-German stance when beginning his next Tintin adventure, &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, which was set in the Middle East and featured Dr. Müller sabotaging oil lines.

During this period, Hergé also contributed to &quot;L&#x27;Ouest&quot; (&quot;The West&quot;), a newspaper run by his friend Raymond De Becker. &quot;L&#x27;Ouest&quot; urged Belgium to remain neutral in World War II, a stance Hergé supported, creating the &quot;Mr Bellum&quot; strip to argue this position. Hergé was invited to visit China by Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who had enjoyed &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, although due to the political situation in Europe, this was not possible. He was re-mobilized in December, and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;. However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for military service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium. &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot; was shut down, part way through the serialisation of &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;.

=== German occupation and &quot;Le Soir&quot;: 1939–1945 ===

As the Belgian Army clashed with the invading Germans, Hergé and his wife fled by car to France along with tens of thousands of other Belgians, first staying in Paris and then heading south to Puy-de-Dôme, where they remained for six weeks. On 28 May, King Leopold III of the Belgians surrendered the country to the German army to prevent further killing; a move that Hergé supported. He followed the king&#x27;s request that all of those Belgians who had fled the country return, arriving back in Brussels on 30 June. There, he found that his house had been occupied as an office for the German army&#x27;s &quot;Propagandastaffel&quot;, and also faced financial trouble, as he owed back taxes yet was unable to access his financial reserves. All Belgian publications were now under the control of the German occupying force, who refused permission to continue publication. Instead, Hergé was offered employment as a cartoonist for by its editor, the Rexist Victor Matthys, but Hergé perceived as an explicitly political publication, and thus declined the position.

Instead, he took up a position with , Belgium&#x27;s largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities had permitted &quot;Le Soir&quot; to be re-opened under the directorship of De Becker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. After joining the &quot;Le Soir&quot; team on 15 October, Hergé was involved in the creation of a children&#x27;s supplement, &quot;Soir-Jeunesse&quot;, aided by Jamin and Jacques Van Melkebeke. He relaunched &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with a new story, &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;, in which Tintin pursued drug smugglers in North Africa; the story was a turning point in the series for its introduction of Captain Haddock, who would become a major character in the rest of the &quot;Adventures&quot;. This story, like the subsequent &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; published in &quot;Le Soir&quot;, would reject the political themes present in earlier stories, instead remaining firmly neutral. Hergé also included new &quot;Quick &amp; Flupke&quot; gags in the supplement, as well as illustrations for serialised stories by Edgar Allan Poe and the Brothers Grimm.

In May 1941, a paper shortage led to the &quot;Soir-Jeunesse&quot; being reduced to four pages, with the length of the Tintin strip being cut by two thirds. Several weeks later the supplement disappeared altogether, with &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; being moved into &quot;Le Soir&quot; itself, where it became a daily strip. While some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration, he was heavily enticed by the size of &#x27;s readership, which reached 600,000. With Van Melkebeke, Hergé put together two Tintin plays. The first, &quot;Tintin in the Indies&quot;, appeared at Brussels&#x27; Theatre des Galeries in April 1941, while the second, &quot;Mr Boullock&#x27;s Disappearance&quot;, was performed there in December. From October 1941 to May 1942, &quot;Le Soir&quot; serialised Hergé&#x27;s next Tintin adventure, &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, followed by publication as a single volume by Casterman. In keeping with &quot;Le Soir&quot;″s editorial standpoint, &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; espoused an anti-Semitic and anti-American attitude, with the antagonist being a wealthy Jewish American businessman; it would thus prove particularly controversial in the post-war period, although Hergé denied any malicious anti-Semitic intention.

Casterman felt that the black-and-white volumes of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942. For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, and that it would not be used for shading. To cope with this additional workload, Hergé approached a friend whom he had met through Van Melkebeke, Edgar P. Jacobs, to aid him as a cartoonist and colourist. Jacobs could only work on the project part-time, and so in March 1942, Hergé also employed a woman named Alice Devos to aid him. In July 1942, Hergé then procured an agent, Bernard Thièry, who took 40% of his commissions; their working relationship would be strained. With their assistance, from 1942 to 1947, Hergé adapted most of his previous &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; into 62-page colour versions.

Hergé&#x27;s next &quot;Adventure of Tintin&quot; would be &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, serialised in &quot;Le Soir&quot; from June 1942. He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had introduced many elements from the work of Jules Verne into the detective story, in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure. &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; marked the first half of a story arc that was completed in &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, serialised in &quot;Le Soir&quot; from February 1943; in this story, Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate&#x27;s treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of Professor Calculus being introduced to the series. Following &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, Hergé drew illustrations for a serialised story titled &quot;Dupont et Dupond, détectives&quot; (&quot;Thomson and Thompson, Detectives&quot;), authored by the newspaper&#x27;s crime editor, Paul Kinnet.

In September 1943, De Becker was removed as editor of &quot;Le Soir&quot; for stating that although the Nazis were motivated &quot;by undoubted good will, [they were also] extremely out of touch with reality&quot;. Although Hergé was close to De Becker, he decided to remain at the newspaper, which came under the editorship of Max Hodeige. In autumn 1943, Hergé had decided that he wanted Jacobs to collaborate with him on &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. Jacobs and Hergé became close collaborators and greatly influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next &quot;Adventure of Tintin&quot;, &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;, which began serialisation in &quot;Le Soir&quot; in December 1943.

=== Post-war controversy: 1944–1946 ===

As the Allied troops liberated Brussels from German occupation, &quot;Le Soir&quot; ceased publication on 2 September 1944, partway through its serialisation of &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;. Hergé was arrested on 3 September, having been named as a collaborator in a Resistance document known as the &quot;Gallery of Traitors&quot;. This would be the first of four incidents in which Hergé was arrested – by the State Security, the Judiciary Police, the Belgian National Movement, and the Front for Independence respectively – during the course of which he spent one night in jail. On 5 September the entire staff of &quot;Le Soir&quot; were fired and a new editorial team introduced, while on 8 September the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) issued a proclamation announcing that &quot;any journalist who had helped produce a newspaper during the occupation was for the time being barred from practising his profession.&quot; Blacklisted, Hergé was now unemployed. Further, he was publicly lampooned as a collaborator by a newspaper closely associated with the Belgian Resistance, &quot;La Patrie&quot;, which issued a satirical strip titled &quot;The Adventures of Tintin in the Land of the Nazis&quot;.

The period witnessed widespread recriminations against accused collaborators, with military courts condemning 30,000 on minor charges and 25,000 on more serious charges; of those, 5,500 were sentenced to life imprisonment or capital punishment. A judiciary inquiry into Hergé&#x27;s case was launched by the deputy public prosecutor, Mr Vinçotte, although in his report he urged lenience, stating that &quot;I am inclined to close the case. I believe it would bring ridicule on the judicial system to go after an inoffensive children&#x27;s book author and illustrator. On the other hand, Hergé worked for &quot;Le Soir&quot; during the war, and his illustrations are what made people buy the newspaper.&quot; Although unable to work for the press, Hergé continued to re-draw and colour the older &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; for publication in book form by Casterman, completing the second version of &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; and starting on &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;. Casterman supported Hergé throughout his ordeal, for which he always remained grateful. Attempting to circumvent his blacklisting, with Jacobs he began producing comics under the anonymous pseudonym of &quot;Olav&quot;, but upon sending them to publishers found none who would accept them. Although this period allowed him an escape from the pressure of daily production which had affected most of his working life, he also had to deal with family problems: His brother Paul returned to Brussels from a German prisoner-of-war camp, while their mother had become highly delusional and was moved to a psychiatric hospital.

In October 1945, Hergé was approached by Raymond Leblanc, a former member of a conservative Resistance group, the National Royalist Movement, and his associates André Sinave and Albert Debaty. The trio were planning on launching a weekly magazine for children, and Leblanc – who had fond childhood memories of &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; – thought Hergé would be ideal for it. Hergé agreed, and Leblanc obtained clearance papers for him, allowing him to work. Concerned about the judicial investigation into Hergé&#x27;s wartime affiliations, Leblanc convinced William Ugeux, a leader of the Belgian Resistance who was now in charge of censorship and certificates of good citizenship, to look into the comic creator&#x27;s file. Ugeux concluded that Hergé had been &quot;a blunderer rather than a traitor&quot; for his work at &quot;Le Soir&quot;. The decision as to whether Hergé would stand trial belonged to the general auditor of the Military Tribunal, Walter Jean Ganshof van der Meersch. He closed the case on 22 December 1945, declaring that &quot;in regard to the particularly inoffensive character of the drawings published by Remi, bringing him before a war tribunal would be inappropriate and risky&quot;.

Now free from threat of prosecution, Hergé continued to support his colleagues at &quot;Le Soir&quot; who were being charged as collaborators; six of them were sentenced to death, and others to lengthy prison sentences. Among those sentenced to death was Hergé&#x27;s friend, Jamin, although his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In May 1946, Hergé was issued a certificate of good citizenship, which became largely necessary to obtain employment in post-war Belgium. Celebrations were marred by his mother&#x27;s death in April 1946; she was aged 60. Harry Thompson has described this post-war period as the &quot;greatest upheaval&quot; of Hergé&#x27;s life. Hergé later described it as &quot;an experience of absolute intolerance. It was horrible, horrible!&quot; He considered the post-war trials of alleged collaborators a great injustice inflicted upon many innocent people, and never forgave Belgian society for the way that he had been treated, although he hid this from his public persona.

== Later life ==
=== Establishing &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine: 1946–1949 ===

Sinave devised the idea of naming their new magazine &quot;Tintin&quot;, believing that this would attract a wide audience. The Dutch-language edition produced for release in Belgium&#x27;s Flemish north was titled &quot;Kuifje&quot; after the character&#x27;s Dutch-language name. Adopting the slogan of &quot;The Newspaper for the Young Aged 7 to 77&quot;, the magazine also used a logo featuring the Tintin character himself. The capital for the project had been put up by those involved: as executive director, Leblanc provided 50%, while its managing director Georges Lallemand provided 40% and Hergé, its artistic director, provided 10%. Hergé assembled a group of associates to aid him, including Van Melkebeke, Jacobs, Paul Cuvelier, and Jacques Laudy. Van Melkebeke was initially appointed editor-in-chief, although he was arrested for having worked for the collaborationist &quot;Le Nouveau journal&quot; shortly after, with his involvement in the project thus being kept secret so as to avoid further controversy. Van Melkebeke continued to provide work for the magazine under pseudonyms, although this ceased during his imprisonment from December 1947 to October 1949.

The first issue of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine was published on 26 September 1946. Hergé was assigned to produce a two-page spread each week, and began by concluding &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; before embarking on its successor story, &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;. Alongside Hergé&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the magazine also included Laudy&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of the Four Aymon Brothers&quot; and Jacobs&#x27; &quot;The Secret of the Swordfish&quot;, the first in his new &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; series. While the magazine was in competition with a number of rivals, most notably &quot;Spirou&quot;, famous for serialising the &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; and &quot;Buck Danny&quot; comics, it proved an immediate success, with 60,000 copies being sold in three days of its release. Its publication resulted in a massive boost to Hergé&#x27;s book sales too.

In 1947 a Belgian film adaptation of &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; was produced, and believing that cinematic adaptations were a good way to proceed, Hergé contacted Disney Studios in the United States; they declined his offer to adapt &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; for the silver screen. In May 1947 the artistic collaboration between Hergé and Jacobs ended after an argument. Hergé had been jealous of the immediate success of Jacobs&#x27; &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; series, and had turned down Jacobs&#x27; request that he be credited as co-creator of the new &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;. That same month, Hergé broke from his manager, Thiery, after discovering that the latter had been siphoning off money for himself.

Many Belgians were highly critical of the magazine due to its connections with Hergé, who was still deemed a collaborator and traitor by many; &quot;La Soir&quot; and &quot;La Cité&quot; publicly criticised the decision without referring to him by name while &quot;Le Quotidien&quot; and &quot;Le Drapeau Rouge&quot; specifically singled him out for denunciation. Hergé believed that the children&#x27;s author Jeanne Cappe was behind many of these accusations, and threatened her with a lawsuit. Unhappy with life in Belgium, Hergé made plans to emigrate to Argentina, a nation that was welcoming many Europeans who had supported the defeated Axis powers and which had a thriving comic book scene. Ultimately, he changed his mind, for reasons that have remained unknown; it is possible that he was unable to secure any promise of work in the South American country.

In May, Hergé and Germaine holidayed near to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland, where they were accompanied by a friend of theirs, a young woman named Rosane. During the holiday, Hergé and Rosane embarked on an extra-marital affair. He felt guilty, and returned to Brussels in June. Privately, he expressed the view that he had been led to commit such an act, which he viewed as immoral, through the influence of &quot;amoral friends&quot; with whom he was associating. Hoping to reignite the passion and stability of his marriage, he arranged to return to Switzerland with Germaine soon after; here they argued and embarked on a temporary separation. Remaining in Switzerland, he visited King Leopold III, who was then holidaying in Prégny, before briefly returning to Brussels in July. Back in Switzerland, he embarked on an affair with a married woman, although again informed Germaine before setting off to spend time in the Ardennes. In August, the couple sought to reunite by holidaying together in Brittany, but there they broke up again and Hergé returned to his lover in Switzerland. In September he finally returned to Brussels, but he then spent time with his close friend Marcel Dehaye in a retreat at the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont. That month, he revived &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; – the &quot;Adventure of Tintin&quot; that had been interrupted by the German invasion of 1940 – and began serialising it in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. However, the story was again interrupted, this time for 12 weeks as Hergé took a further unannounced holiday to Gland, greatly annoying many of his colleagues.

Although they retained respect for each other, Hergé&#x27;s repeated absences had created a tense situation between himself and Leblanc. After a lengthy search, Leblanc had found a publisher willing to produce an edition of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine in France: Georges Dargaud&#x27;s Le Lombard, which began production of a French edition in October 1948. However, Hergé was unhappy that Leblanc had appointed André Frenez as Van Melkebeke&#x27;s replacement as editor-in-chief, describing Frenez as &quot;a cold functionary&quot;. Hergé was stubborn and uncompromising as the magazine&#x27;s artistic director, known for strongly criticising the work of old friends like Pierre Ickx if he felt that they did not meet his exacting standards. He was particularly critical of the work of two of the newly hired staff at &quot;Tintin&quot; and &quot;Kuifje&quot;, Jacques Martin and Willy Vandersteen, encouraging them to change their artistic style to better reflect his own preferences. To Leblanc, he expressed the concern that most of those working at &quot;Tintin&quot; were better illustrators than storytellers. He also opined that &quot;Tintin&quot; was not keeping up with the times and what he perceived as the increased maturity of children, encouraging the magazine to better reflect current events and scientific developments.

=== Studios Hergé and Fanny Vlamynck: 1950–1965 ===
On 6 April 1950 Hergé established Studios Hergé as a public company. The Studios were based in his Avenue Delleur house in Brussels, with Hergé making a newly purchased country house in Céroux-Mousty his and Germaine&#x27;s main residence. The Studios would provide both personal support to Hergé and technical support for his ongoing work. The Studio initially had only three employees; the staff would increase to 15, all of whom were working on Hergé&#x27;s projects. He hired Bob de Moor as his primary apprentice at the Studios in March 1951. Impressed by Jacques Martin&#x27;s work on &quot;The Golden Sphinx&quot;, Hergé persuaded Martin to join the Studios in January 1954; Martin insisted on bringing with him his own two assistants, Roger Leloup and Michel Demarets. During the early 1950s, a number of those convicted for collaborating with the Nazi occupiers were freed from prison. Sympathetic to their plight, Hergé lent money to some and aided others in getting jobs at &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine, much to Leblanc&#x27;s annoyance. For instance, as well as lending him money, Hergé used his connections to secure Raymond de Becker a job in Switzerland as a book shop sales inspector. He also hired those associated with collaboration for his Studios; his new colourist, Josette Baujot, was the wife of a recently assassinated member of the Walloon Legion, and his new secretary, Baudouin van der Branden de Reeth, had served a prison sentence for working at &quot;Le Nouveau Journal&quot; during the occupation.

Hergé had developed the idea of setting an &quot;Adventure of Tintin&quot; on the moon while producing &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;. He began serialisation of &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, the first of a two part arc followed by &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;, in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine in March 1950. In September 1950, Hergé broke off the story, feeling the need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and Germaine went on holiday to Gland before returning to Brussels in late September. Many readers sent letters to &quot;Tintin&quot; asking why &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Hergé had died. &quot;Explorers of the Moon&quot; would resume after an eighteen-month hiatus, returning in April 1952. Alongside his work on the new stories, Hergé also made use of the Studios in revising more of his early works.

In February 1952, Hergé was involved in a car crash in which Germaine&#x27;s leg was shattered; she had to have a steel rod implanted in it, and was confined to a wheelchair for several months. Their relationship was further strained when they received news of Wallez&#x27; death in September 1952. His friendship with Van Melkebeke also broke apart in this period, in part due to advice gained from an alleged clairvoyant, Bertje Janueneau, upon whom both Hergé and Germaine were increasingly relying for guidance. In January 1955 a young woman named Fanny Vlamynck (fr) was hired as a colourist at the Studios. Hergé embarked on an extramarital affair with her in November 1956, with the rest of the studio staff soon finding out. Germaine grew suspicious of her husband&#x27;s affections for Fanny, but was also experiencing a strong romantic attraction to her ballroom dance partner. Hergé and Germaine went on a cruise for the former&#x27;s 50th birthday in May 1957, during which they visited Casablanca, Rabat, Palermo, and Rome. They went on a second holiday to Ostend in October. Following the trip to Ostend, he revealed his affair with Fanny to Germaine. He began experiencing traumatic dreams dominated by the colour white and, seeking to explain them, he visited Franz Ricklin, a psychoanalyst who was a student of Carl Jung in Zürich in May 1959. In February 1960 he returned to Switzerland, and upon his return to Brussels he began renting an apartment in Uccle, away from Germaine. His relationship with Germaine had ended, although due to restrictions under Belgian law he was unable to obtain a divorce until 17 years later.
In September 1958, &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine moved its headquarters to a newly constructed building near the Gare du Midi. Hergé continued to feud with Leblanc over the direction of the magazine; his constant absences had led to him being replaced as artistic director, and he demanded that he be reinstated. Leblanc relented in early 1965, although Hergé soon departed to Sardinia for six weeks. In October 1965 Leblanc appointed the cartoonist Greg to be editor-in-chief of the magazine, believing him capable of reforming the paper to remain relevant to the youth of the day. By this point, &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine was at its commercial peak, with sales of 600,000 a week, although Hergé had lost much of his interest in it.

Supported by his studio, Hergé produced &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; in 1954–1956 and &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; in 1956–1957. Hergé&#x27;s book sales were higher than ever, and translations were being produced for the British, Spanish, and Scandinavian markets. He was receiving international press attention, with articles on his work appearing in &quot;France-Observateur&quot;, &quot;The Listener&quot;, and &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. Paul Vandromme authored an uncritical book on Hergé, &quot;Le Monde de Tintin&quot; (&quot;The World of Tintin&quot;), published by Éditions Gallimard in 1959; Hergé vetoed the inclusion of a proposed preface by Roger Nimier after finding its praise for his own work too embarrassing. Radio adaptations of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; were produced, as was an animated cartoon series produced by Belvision Studios, &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;. Two live-action films were also produced, &quot;Tintin and the Golden Fleece&quot; (1961) and &quot;Tintin and the Blue Oranges&quot; (1964), the former of which Hergé had been closely involved with.

Developing an interest in modern art, in the early 1960s Hergé befriended the art dealer Marcel Stal, owner of the Carrefour gallery in Brussels. He was a particular fan of the work of Constant Permeke, Jakob Smits, Lucio Fontana, and Jean-Pierre Raynaurd, as well as the pop art movement, in particular the work of Roy Lichtenstein. He built up his own personal collection, which consisted of both modern paintings as well as African art and Chinese ceramics. In 1962, Hergé decided he wanted to paint. He chose Louis Van Lint, one of the most respected Belgian abstract painters at the time, whose work he liked a lot, to be his private teacher. Hergé took up painting as a hobby, producing abstract art works which were influenced by the styles of Joan Miró and Serge Poliakoff. He showed his work to the art historian Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Musées des Beaux-Arts, who believed that they showed promise, but that Hergé&#x27;s real talent lay with cartooning. Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all. Spending less time on new &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, from June to December 1965 &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine serialised a redrawn and newly coloured version of &quot;The Black Island&quot; prepared by staff at Studios Hergé.

=== Final years: 1966–1983 ===

In the 1960s, Hergé became increasingly annoyed at the success of René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo&#x27;s &quot;Asterix&quot; comic book series, which various commentators had described as eclipsing &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; as the foremost comic in the Franco-Belgian tradition. Hoping to imitate the success of the recent animated films &quot;Asterix the Gaul&quot; (1967) and &quot;Asterix and Cleopatra&quot; (1968), Hergé agreed to the production of two animated Belvision films based on the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;. The first, &quot;Tintin and the Temple of the Sun&quot; (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, &quot;Tintin and the Lake of Sharks&quot; (1972) was an original story written by Greg. In 1982, the US filmmaker Steven Spielberg requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, a prospect that excited Hergé, but the project would not come to fruition until long after his death.

In a wide-ranging interview with the journalist Numa Sadoul in October 1971, Hergé opened up about many of the problems he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Hergé made many alterations to the transcript, both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him in a negative light. Editors at Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Hergé expressed a negative view of Catholicism. The interview was published as &quot;Tintin et moi&quot; (&quot;Tintin and Me&quot;) in 1975. Hergé followed this by agreeing to be the subject of a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, &quot;Moi, Tintin&quot; (&quot;I, Tintin&quot;), which premiered in 1975. In January 1977 he attended an early comic book convention at Angoulême, where he was widely heralded as one of the masters of the discipline. To mark the fiftieth anniversary of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; in 1979, a celebratory event was held at Brussels&#x27; Hilton hotel, while an exhibit on &quot;Le Musée imaginaire de Tintin&quot; (&quot;The Imaginary Museum of Tintin&quot;) was held at the Palais de Beaux-Arts.

In April 1971 Hergé visited the U.S. for the first time, primarily to visit a liver specialist in Rochester, Minnesota; however, on the trip he also visited a Sioux reservation in South Dakota, but was shocked at the conditions in which their inhabitants lived. On this visit he also spent time in Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Kansas City. In April 1972 he travelled to New York City for an international conference on the strip cartoon, and there presented Mayor John Lindsay with a cartoon of Tintin visiting the city and also met with the pop artist Andy Warhol. Several years later, in 1977, Warhol visited Europe, where he produced a pop art portrait of Hergé. In April 1973, Hergé took up an invitation to visit Taiwan by the nation&#x27;s government, in recognition of his promotion of Chinese culture in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;. During the visit he also spent time in Thailand and Bali.

Hergé had long sought to regain contact with his old friend Zhang Chongren, with whom he had lost contact. He regularly asked any Chinese people that he met if they knew of Zhang, and in 1979 had some success when a staff member in a Brussels Chinese restaurant revealed that he was Zhang&#x27;s godson. Hergé was thus able to re-establish contact with his old friend. The journalist Gérard Valet organised for Zhang to visit Brussels so that he and Hergé could be re-united. The event took place in March 1981, and was heavily publicised; Hergé, however, found the situation difficult, disliking the press attention and finding that he and Zhang had grown distant during the intervening years.

In June 1970, Hergé&#x27;s father died, and after the funeral he holidayed near Lake Geneva. In 1974, his assistant Branden suffered a stroke and was left unable to write, with Hergé replacing him with a young man, Alain Baran, who Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline later termed Hergé&#x27;s &quot;surrogate son&quot;. In March 1977, Hergé&#x27;s divorce with Germaine was finalised; although Hergé continued to visit her and financially support her, Germaine took the divorce badly, viewing it as a further betrayal. Hergé was then able to marry Fanny several weeks later, in a low-key ceremony on 20 May; he was 70 years old and she was 42.

==== Death ====

In 1979, Hergé was diagnosed with osteomyelofibrosis, necessitating a complete blood transfusion. His need for blood transfusions had increased, as he came to require them every two weeks, and then every week.

On 25 February 1983, Hergé suffered cardiac arrest and was hospitalised in intensive care at Brussels&#x27; Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc. He had been scheduled to meet with Steven Spielberg, who later made &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011). He died at Saint-Luc on 3 March, at the age of 75. His death received front page coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including &quot;Libération&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot;. In his will, he had left Fanny as his sole heir.

In November 1986, Fanny closed Studios Hergé, replacing it with the Hergé Foundation.

In 1988, &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine was discontinued.

== Personal life ==
Hergé was a highly private person, being described by biographer Harry Thompson as &quot;reserved [and] unostentatious&quot;. According to his biographer Pierre Sterckx, Hergé appeared &quot;very conventional&quot; in public, but in reality was &quot;extremely erudite, with an insatiable curiosity, constantly on the watch&quot;. He greatly enjoyed walking in the countryside, gardening, and art collecting, and he was a fan of jazz music. Although he disliked making public or press appearances, Hergé insisted on personally responding to all fan mail received, which took up a considerable part of his time. He stated that &quot;not replying to children&#x27;s letters would be to betray their dreams.&quot; Friends described him as a humorous man, known particularly for his self-deprecating jokes. Colleagues described Hergé as egocentric, an assessment he agreed with. He was known to be authoritarian in dealing with his assistants and refused to share credit with them for their part in his work. Sterckx noted that &quot;on the one hand he could be distant, even frosty, but on the other he was affectionate&quot;.

Throughout his first marriage he had a number of affairs with other women. He had no children, having been rendered sterile by radiation treatment, but in the 1950s offered to adopt his brother Paul&#x27;s two children, Denise and George, when their parents were experiencing trouble in their relationship. Paul declined the offer, with Denise and George later noting that they had no great affection for their uncle, deeming him awkward around children. Hergé was raised as a Catholic, although he was never a devout practitioner of the religion. His adherence to Catholicism declined in later life as he developed a keen interest in Taoism, and became an agnostic. He was a fan of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and Arnaud Desjardins&#x27; &quot;The Path to Wisdom&quot;, as well as Fritjof Capra&#x27;s &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot; and the work of Jean-Émile Charon.

=== Political views ===
Politically, Hergé was a fervent royalist, and remained so throughout his life, also believing in the unity of Belgium. In his early life, Hergé was &quot;close to the traditional right-wing&quot; of Belgian society, with Sterckx noting that through his work he was &quot;plunged into rightist, even extreme right-wing circles&quot;. According to Harry Thompson, such political ideas were not unusual in middle-class circles in Belgium of the 1920s and early 1930s, where &quot;patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline and naivety were so inextricably bound together in everyone&#x27;s lives that right-wing politics were an almost inevitable by-product. It was a world view shared by everyone, distinguished principally by its complete ignorance of the world.&quot; When Hergé took responsibility for , he followed Wallez&#x27;s instruction and allowed the newspaper to contain explicitly pro-fascist and anti-semitic sentiment. Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès noted that the character of Tintin was a personification of the &quot;New Youth&quot; concept which was promoted by the European far-right. Under Wallez&#x27;s guidance, the early &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; contained explicit political messages for its young readership. &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; was a work of anti-socialist propaganda, while &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; was designed to encourage colonialist sentiment toward the Belgian Congo, and &quot;Tintin in America&quot; was designed as a work of anti-Americanism heavily critical of capitalism, commercialism, and industrialisation.

In contrast to Hergé&#x27;s involvement in Belgium&#x27;s right-wing, Sterckx thought the cartoonist to have been &quot;a liberal and independent spirit&quot;, someone who was &quot;the very opposite of a conservative [or] a reactionary of the right&quot;. Michael Farr asserted that Hergé had &quot;an acute political conscience&quot; during his earlier days, as exemplified by his condemnation of racism in the United States evident in &quot;Tintin in America&quot;. Literary critic Tom McCarthy went further, remarking that &quot;Tintin in America&quot; represented the emergence of a &quot;left-wing counter tendency&quot; in Hergé&#x27;s work that rebelled against his right-wing milieu and which was particularly critical of wealthy capitalists and industrialists. This was furthered in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, in which Hergé rejected his &quot;classically right-wing&quot; ideas to embrace an anti-imperialist stance, and in a contemporary &quot;Quick &amp; Flupke&quot; strip in which he lampooned the far-right leaders of Germany and Italy, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Although many of his friends and colleagues did so in the mid-1930s, Hergé did not join the far-right Rexist Party, later asserting that he &quot;had always had an aversion to it&quot; and commenting that &quot;to throw my heart and soul into an ideology is the opposite of who I am.&quot;

=== Accusations of racism ===

Hergé faced repeated accusations of racism due to his portrayal of diverse ethnic groups throughout &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. According to McCarthy, in &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; Hergé represented the Congolese as &quot;good at heart, but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery&quot;. Thompson argued that Hergé had not written the book to be &quot;deliberately racist&quot; and that it reflected the average early 20th-century Belgian view of the Congolese, which was more patronising than malevolent. The book provoked no controversy at the time, coming to be perceived as racist only in the latter half of the 20th century.

In the following adventure, &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, Hergé depicted members of the Blackfoot tribe of Native Americans as &quot;gullible, even naive&quot;, though it was nevertheless &quot;broadly sympathetic&quot; to their culture and plight, depicting their oppression at the hands of the United States Army. &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; received both criticism for depicting the Japanese as militaristic and buck-toothed and praise for representing a less stereotypical vision of China than was the norm in Europe at the time.

Hergé has also been accused of utilising anti-semitic stereotypes, despite Hergé&#x27;s protestations that the character of Rastapopoulos was Greek, and not Jewish.

From his early years, Hergé was openly critical of racism. He lambasted the pervasive racism of U.S. society in a prelude comment to &quot;Tintin in America&quot; published in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; on 20 August 1931, and ridiculed racist attitudes toward the Chinese in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;. Peeters asserted that &quot;Hergé was no more racist than the next man&quot;, an assessment shared by Farr, who after meeting Hergé in the 1980s commented that &quot;you couldn&#x27;t have met someone who was more open and less racist&quot;. In contrast, Laurence Grove, president of the International &quot;Bande Dessinée&quot; Society, opined that Hergé adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work, noting, &quot;When it was fashionable to be a Nazi, he was a Nazi. When it was fashionable to be a colonial racist, that&#x27;s what he was.&quot; Discussing Tintin&#x27;s racist elements, the Vietnamese-American novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen observed that &quot;Hergé&#x27;s work is deeply flawed, and yet riveting narratively and aesthetically. I have forgotten all the well-intentioned, moralistic children&#x27;s literature that I have read, but I haven&#x27;t forgotten Hergé.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Assouline described Hergé as &quot;the personification of Belgium&quot;.

He also had an asteroid, 1652 Hergé, within the main belt, named after him in 1953.

=== In popular culture ===

A cartoon version of Hergé makes a number of cameo appearances in the 1990s animated television series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. An animated version of Hergé also makes a cameo appearance at the start of the 2011 motion capture film, &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson, where he is depicted as a street cartoonist drawing a portrait of Tintin in the style of the comic at the start of the film.

=== Hergé Museum ===

The Musée Hergé is located in the centre of Louvain-la-Neuve, a city to the south of Brussels. This location was originally chosen for the museum in 2001. The futuristic building was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning French architect Christian de Portzamparc and cost €15 million to build. On the centenary of the birth of Hergé, 22 May 2007, the museum&#x27;s first stone was laid. The museum opened its doors in June 2009.

The idea of a museum dedicated to the work of Hergé can be traced back to the end of the 1970s, when Hergé was still alive. After his death in 1983, Hergé&#x27;s widow, Fanny, led the efforts, undertaken at first by the Hergé Foundation and then by the new Studios Hergé, to catalogue and choose the artwork and elements that would become part of the museum&#x27;s exhibitions.

The Hergé Museum contains eight permanent galleries displaying original artwork by Hergé, and telling the story of his life and career which had not previously been visible to the public. The museum also houses a temporary exhibition gallery. Although Tintin features prominently in the museum, Hergé&#x27;s other comic strip characters, such as Jo, Zette and Jocko, and Quick and Flupke, as well as his work as a graphic designer, are also present.

<text>The Horned God is one of the two primary deities found in Wicca and some related forms of Neopaganism. 
The term &quot;Horned God&quot; itself predates Wicca, and is an early 20th-century syncretic term for a horned or antlered anthropomorphic god partly based on historical horned deities.

The Horned God represents the male part of the religion&#x27;s duotheistic theological system, the consort of the female Triple goddess of the Moon or other Mother goddess. 
In common Wiccan belief, he is associated with nature, wilderness, sexuality, hunting, and the life cycle. Whilst depictions of the deity vary, he is always shown with either horns or antlers upon his head, often depicted as being theriocephalic (having a beast&#x27;s head), in this way emphasizing &quot;the union of the divine and the animal&quot;, the latter of which includes humanity.

In traditional Wicca (British Traditional Wicca), he is generally regarded as a dualistic god of twofold aspects: bright and dark, night and day, summer and winter, the Oak King and the Holly King. In this dualistic view, his two horns symbolize, in part, his dual nature. (The use of horns to symbolize duality is also reflected in the phrase &quot;on the horns of a dilemma.&quot;) The three aspects of the Goddess and the two aspects of the Horned god are sometimes mapped on to the five points of the Pentagram or Pentacle, although which points correspond to which deity aspects varies. In some other systems, he is represented as a triune god, split into three aspects that reflect those of the Triple goddess: the (Warrior), the , and the Sage.

The Horned God has been explored within several psychological theories and has become a recurrent theme in fantasy literature.

==In Wicca==

In traditional and mainstream Wicca, the Horned God is viewed as the divine male principality, being both equal and opposite to the Goddess. The Wiccan god himself can be represented in many forms, including as the Sun God, the Sacrificed God and the Vegetation God, although the Horned God is the most popular representation. The pioneers of the various Wiccan or Witchcraft traditions, such as Gerald Gardner, Doreen Valiente and Robert Cochrane, all claimed that their religion was a continuation of the pagan religion of the Witch-Cult following historians who had purported the Witch-Cult&#x27;s existence, such as Jules Michelet and Margaret Murray.

For Wiccans, the Horned God is &quot;the personification of the life force energy in animals and the wild&quot; and is associated with the wilderness, virility and the hunt. Doreen Valiente writes that the Horned God also carries the souls of the dead to the underworld.

Wiccans generally, as well as some other neopagans, tend to conceive of the universe as polarized into gender opposites of male and female energies. In traditional Wicca, the Horned God and the Goddess are seen as equal and opposite in gender polarity. However, in some of the newer traditions of Wicca, and especially those influenced by feminist ideology, there is more emphasis on the Goddess, and consequently the symbolism of the Horned God is less developed than that of the Goddess.
In Wicca the cycle of the seasons is celebrated during eight sabbats called The Wheel of the Year. The seasonal cycle is imagined to follow the relationship between the Horned God and the Goddess. The Horned God is born in winter, impregnates the Goddess and then dies during the autumn and winter months and is then reborn by the Goddess at Yule. The different relationships throughout the year are sometimes distinguished by splitting the god into aspects, the Oak King and the Holly King. The relationships between the Goddess and the Horned God are mirrored by Wiccans in seasonal rituals. There is some variation between Wiccan groups as to which sabbat corresponds to which part of the cycle. Some Wiccans regard the Horned God as dying at Lammas, August 1; also known as Lughnasadh, which is the first harvest sabbat. Others may see him dying at Mabon, the autumn equinox, or the second harvest festival. Still other Wiccans conceive of the Horned God dying on October 31, which Wiccans call Samhain, the ritual of which is focused on death. He is then reborn on Winter Solstice, December 21.

Other important dates for the Horned God include Imbolc when, according to Valiente, he leads a wild hunt. In Gardnerian Wicca, the Dryghten prayer recited at the end of every ritual meeting contains the lines referring to the Horned God:

According to Sabina Magliocco, Gerald Gardner says (in 1959&#x27;s &quot;The Meaning of Witchcraft&quot;) that The Horned God is an Under-god, a mediator between an unknowable supreme deity and the people. (In Wiccan liturgy in the Book of Shadows, this conception of an unknowable supreme deity is referred to as &quot;Dryghtyn.&quot; It is not a personal god, but rather an impersonal divinity similar to the Tao of Taoism.)

Whilst the Horned God is the most common depiction of masculine divinity in Wicca, he is not the only representation. Other examples include the Green Man and the Sun God. In traditional Wicca, however, these other representations of the Wiccan god are subsumed or amalgamated into the Horned God, as aspects or expressions of him. Sometimes this is shown by adding horns or antlers to the iconography. The Green Man, for example, may be shown with branches resembling antlers; and the Sun God may be depicted with a crown or halo of solar rays, that may resemble horns. These other conceptions of the Wiccan god should not be regarded as displacing the Horned God, but rather as elaborating on various facets of his nature. Doreen Valiente has called the Horned God &quot;the eldest of gods&quot; in both The Witches Creed and also in her Invocation To The Horned God.

Wiccans believe that The Horned God, as Lord of Death, is their &quot;comforter and consoler&quot; after death and before reincarnation; and that he rules the Underworld or Summerland where the souls of the dead reside as they await rebirth. Some, such as Joanne Pearson, believe that this is based on the Mesopotamian myth of Inanna&#x27;s descent into the underworld, though this has not been confirmed.

===Names===
Doreen Valiente, a former High Priestess of the Gardnerian tradition, claimed that Gerald Gardner&#x27;s Bricket Wood coven referred to the god as Cernunnos, or Kernunno, which is a Latin word, discovered on a stone carving found in France, meaning &quot;the Horned One&quot;. Valiente claimed that the coven also referred to the god as Janicot, which she theorised was of Basque origin, and Gardner also used this name in his novel &quot;High Magic&#x27;s Aid&quot;.

Stewart Farrar, a High Priest of the Alexandrian tradition referred to the Horned God as Karnayna, which he believed was a corruption of &quot;Cernunnos&quot;. The historian Ronald Hutton suggests the term derived instead from the Arabic &quot;Dhul-Qarnayn&quot; meaning &quot;Horned One&quot;, as Murray offered in her 1931 book &quot;The God of the Witches&quot;, a source that likely influenced Alex Sanders. Prudence Jones has suggested that the name may instead derive from Karneios, a Spartan deity conflated with Apollo as a subordinate consort to Diana.

In the writings of Charles Cardell and Raymond Howard, the god was referred to as Atho. Howard had a wooden statue of Atho&#x27;s head which he claimed was 2200 years old, but the statue was stolen in April 1967. Howard&#x27;s son later admitted that his father had carved the statue himself.

In Cochrane&#x27;s Craft, which was founded by Robert Cochrane, the Horned God was often referred to by a Biblical name; Tubal-cain, who, according to the Bible was the first blacksmith. In this neopagan concept, the god is also referred to as Brân, a Welsh mythological figure, Wayland, the smith in Germanic mythology, and Herne, a horned figure from English folklore.

In the neopagan tradition of Stregheria, founded by Raven Grimassi and loosely inspired by the works of Charles Godfrey Leland, the Horned God goes by several names, including Dianus, Faunus, Cern, and Actaeon.

In the Hinduism, the Horned God is referred to Pashupati, See Pashupati seal.

==In psychology==

===Jungian analysis===
Sherry Salman considers the image of the Horned God in Jungian terms, as an archetypal protector and mediator of the outside world to the objective psyche. In her theory the male psyche&#x27;s &#x27;Horned God&#x27; frequently compensates for inadequate fathering.

When first encountered, the figure is a dangerous, &#x27;hairy chthonic wildman&#x27; possessed of kindness and intelligence. If repressed, later in life The Horned God appears as the lord of the Otherworld, or Hades. If split off entirely, he leads to violence, substance abuse and sexual perversion. When integrated he gives the male an ego &quot;in possession of its own destructiveness&quot; and for the female psyche gives an effective animus relating to both the physical body and the psyche.

In considering the Horned God as a symbol recurring in women&#x27;s literature, Richard Sugg suggests the Horned God represents the &#x27;natural Eros&#x27;, a masculine lover subjugating the social-conformist nature of the female shadow, thus encompassing a combination of the shadow and animus. One such example is Heathcliff from Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Sugg goes on to note that female characters who are paired with this character usually end up socially ostracised, or worse—in an inverted ending to the male hero-story.

===Humanistic psychology===
Following the work of Robert Bly in the Mythopoetic men&#x27;s movement, John Rowan proposes the Horned God as a &quot;Wild Man&quot; be used as a fantasy image or &quot;sub-personality&quot; helpful to men in humanistic psychology, and escaping from &quot;narrow societal images of masculinity&quot; encompassing excessive deference to women and paraphillia.

==Theories of historical origins==
Many horned deities are known to have been worshipped in various cultures throughout history. Evidence for horned gods appear very early in the human record. The so-called Sorcerer dates from perhaps 13,000 BCE. Twenty-one red deer headdresses, made from the skulls of the red deer and likely fitted with leather laces, have been uncovered at the Mesolithic site of Star Carr. They are thought to date from roughly 9,000 BCE. Several theories have been created to establish historical roots for modern Neopagan worship of a Horned God.

===Margaret Murray===
Following the writings of suffragist Matilda Joslyn Gage and others, Margaret Murray, in her 1921 book &quot;The Witch-Cult in Western Europe&quot;, proposed the theory that the witches of the early-modern period were remnants of a pagan cult and that the Christian Church had declared the god of the witches was in fact the Devil. Without recourse to any specific representation of this deity, Murray speculates that the head coverings common in inquisition-derived descriptions of the devil &quot;may throw light on one of the possible origins of the cult.&quot;
In 1931 Murray published a sequel, &quot;The God of the Witches&quot;, which tries to gather evidence in support of her witch-cult theory. In Chapter 1 &quot;The Horned God&quot;. Murray claims that various depictions of humans with horns from European and Indian sources, ranging from the paleolithic French cave painting of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; to the Indic Pashupati to the modern English Dorset Ooser, are evidence for an unbroken, Europe-wide tradition of worship of a singular Horned God. Murray derived this model of a horned god cult from James Frazer and Jules Michelet.

In dealing with &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, the earliest evidence claimed, Murray based her observations on a drawing by Henri Breuil, which some modern scholars such as Ronald Hutton claim is inaccurate. Hutton states that modern photographs show the original cave art lacks horns, a human torso or any other significant detail on its upper half. However, others, such as celebrated prehistorian Jean Clottes, assert that Breuil&#x27;s sketch is indeed accurate. Clottes stated that &quot;I have seen it myself perhaps 20 times over the years&quot;.

Breuil considered his drawing to represent a shaman or magician—an interpretation which gives the image its name. Murray having seen the drawing called Breuil&#x27;s image &quot;the first depiction of a deity&quot;, an idea which Breuil and others later adopted.

Murray also used an inaccurate drawing of a mesolithic rock-painting at Cogul in northeast Spain as evidence of group religious ceremony of the cult, although the central male figure is not horned. The illustration she used of the Cogul painting leaves out a number of figures, human and animal, and the original is more likely a sequence of superimposed but unrelated illustrations, rather than a depiction of a single scene.

Despite widespread criticism of Murray&#x27;s scholarship some minor aspects of her work continued to have supporters.

====Influences from literature====
The popular image of the Greek god Pan was removed from its classical context in the writings of the Romantics of the 18th century and connected with their ideals of a pastoral England. This, along with the general public&#x27;s increasing lack of familiarity of Greek mythology at the time led to the figure of Pan becoming generalised as a &#x27;horned god&#x27;, and applying connotations to the character, such as benevolence that were not evident in the original Greek myths which in turn gave rise to the popular acceptance of Murray&#x27;s hypothetical horned god of the witches.

The reception of &quot;Aradia&quot; amongst Neopagans has not been entirely positive. Clifton suggests that modern claims of revealing an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition, for example those of Leo Martello and Raven Grimassi, must be &quot;match[ed] against&quot;, and compared with the claims in &quot;Aradia&quot;. He further suggests that a lack of comfort with &quot;Aradia&quot; may be due to an &quot;insecurity&quot; within Neopaganism about the movement&#x27;s claim to authenticity as a religious revival.

Valiente offers another explanation for the negative reaction of some neopagans; that the identification of Lucifer as the god of the witches in &quot;Aradia&quot; was &quot;too strong meat&quot; for Wiccans who were used to the gentler, romantic paganism of Gerald Gardner and were especially quick to reject any relationship between witchcraft and Satanism.
In 1985 Classical historian Georg Luck, in his &quot;Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds&quot;, theorised that the origins of the Witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of Cernunnos, a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman Pan/Faunus, a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the Devil, and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.

====Influences from occultism====
Eliphas Levi&#x27;s image of &quot;Baphomet&quot; serves as an example of the transformation of the Devil into a benevolent fertility deity and provided the prototype for Murray&#x27;s horned god. Murray&#x27;s central thesis that images of the Devil were actually of deities and that Christianity had demonised these worshippers as following Satan, is first recorded in the work of Levi in the fashionable 19th-century Occultist circles of England and France. Levi created his image of Baphomet, published in his &quot;Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie&quot; (1855), by combining symbolism from diverse traditions, including the &quot;Diable&quot; card of the 16th and 17th century Tarot of Marseille. Lévi called his image &quot;The Goat of Mendes&quot;, possibly following Herodotus&#x27; account that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat&#x27;s face and legs. Herodotus relates how all male goats were held in great reverence by the Mendesians, and how in his time a woman publicly copulated with a goat. E. A. Wallis Budge writes,

Historically, the deity that was venerated at Egyptian Mendes was a ram deity Banebdjedet (literally Ba of the lord of djed, and titled &quot;the Lord of Mendes&quot;), who was the soul of Osiris. Lévi combined the images of the Tarot of Marseilles Devil card and refigured the ram &quot;Banebdjed&quot; as a he-goat, further imagined by him as &quot;copulator in Anep and inseminator in the district of Mendes&quot;.

===Gerald Gardner and Wicca===
Margaret Murray&#x27;s theory of the historical origins of the Horned God has been used by Wiccans to create a myth of historical origins for their religion. There is no verifiable evidence to support claims that the religion originates earlier than the mid-20th century.

Modern scholarship has disproved Margaret Murray&#x27;s theory. However, various horned gods and mother goddesses were indeed worshipped in the British Isles during the ancient and early medieval periods.

The &quot;father of Wicca&quot;, Gerald Gardner, who adopted Margaret Murray&#x27;s thesis, claimed Wicca was a modern survival of an ancient pan-European pagan religion. Gardner states that he had reconstructed elements of the religion from fragments, incorporating elements from Freemasonry, the Occult, and Theosophy, which came together in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, where Gardner met Aleister Crowley.

Gerald Gardner was initiated into the O.T.O. by Aleister Crowley and subsequently went on to found the Neopagan religion of Wicca. Various scholars on early Wiccan history, such as Ronald Hutton, Philip Heselton, and Leo Ruickbie concur that witchcraft&#x27;s early rituals, as devised by Gardner, contained much from Crowley&#x27;s writings such as the Gnostic Mass.

===Romano-Celtic fusion===
Georg Luck, repeats part of Murray&#x27;s theory, stating that the Horned God may have appeared in late antiquity, stemming from the merging of Cernunnos, an antlered god of the Continental Celts, with the Greco-Roman Pan/Faunus, a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the devil, and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.

==Art, fantasy and science fiction==
In 1908&#x27;s &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; by Kenneth Grahame, in Chapter 7, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, Ratty and Mole meet a mystical horned being, powerful, fearsome and kind. Grahame&#x27;s work was a significant part of the cultural milieu which stripped the Greek god Pan of his cultural identity in favor of an unnamed, generic horned deity which led to Murray&#x27;s thesis of historical origins.

Outside of works that predate the publication of Murray&#x27;s thesis, horned god motifs and characters appear in fantasy literature that draws upon her work and that of her followers.

The 1947 short story &quot;Cwm Garon&quot; by L. T. C. Rolt (published in Rolt&#x27;s collection &quot;Sleep No More&quot;) describes a traveller encountering a remote Welsh village, where the inhabitants worship a demonic entity that appears as a horned god.

In the novel &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; (1953) by Arthur C. Clarke, all humans have a collective premonition, also described as a memory of the future, of horned aliens which arrive to usher in a new phase of human evolution. The collective subconscious image of the horned aliens is what accounts for mankind&#x27;s image of the devil or Satan. This theme is also explored in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Dæmons&quot; in 1971, where the local superstitions around a landmark known as The Devil&#x27;s Hump prove to be based on reality, as aliens from the planet Dæmos have been affecting man&#x27;s progress over the millennia and the Hump actually contains a spacecraft. The only Dæmon to appear is a classic interpretation of a horned satyr-like being with hooves.

In the 1950s TV series created by Nigel Kneale, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, depictions of supernatural horned entities, with specific reference to prehistoric cave-art and shamanistic horned head-dress are revealed to be a &quot;race-memory&quot; of psychic Martian grasshoppers, manifested at the climax of the film by a fiery horned god.

The 1956 novel &quot;The Golden Strangers&quot; by Henry Treece features a &quot;Hornman&quot;, a priest of the &quot;Children of the Sun&quot; tribe. The Hornman performs numerous human sacrifices while wearing a hood with stag&#x27;s horns attached to it. According to historian Marion Gibson, Treece based the Hornman character on Murray&#x27;s conception of the Horned God.

The Philip José Farmer novel &quot;Flesh&quot; depicts a future society where the protagonist, Peter Stagg, adopts the role of the &quot;Horned King&quot;. The Horned King serves as a figure of male fertility to a goddess-worshipping female priesthood, and resembles Murray&#x27;s conception of the Horned God. 

In some of Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s novels, including the medieval-set novel &quot;Knight&#x27;s Fee&quot; (1960) and the Arthurian novel &quot;Sword at Sunset&quot; (1963), several of the heroes worship a stag-antlered deity called the Horned One. The depiction of this deity is similar to that given in Murray&#x27;s writings.
Murray&#x27;s theories have been seen to have had influence on the horror film &quot;The Blood on Satan&#x27;s Claw&quot; (1971), where a murderous female-led cult worships a horned deity named Behemoth.

In the fantasy novel &quot;Too Long A Sacrifice&quot; by Mildred Downey Broxon (1981), a male character, Tadhg, is an avatar of a benevolent Horned God.

Marion Zimmer Bradley, who acknowledges the influence of Murray, uses the figure of the &quot;horned god&quot; in her feminist fantasy transformation of Arthurian myth, &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; (1984), and portrays ritualistic incest between King Arthur as the representative of the horned god and his sister Morgaine as the &quot;spring maiden&quot;.

In the Richard Carpenter television series &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; (1984), Robin Hood is taught and guided by a shaman-like figure called Herne the Hunter (a figure from English legend). Herne wears a headdress of a horned stag&#x27;s head. Carpenter stated in an interview that Herne was based on the Pagan idea of the Horned God.

In June 1986, the comic book &quot;2000 AD&quot; published the first part of a serial story called &quot;Sláine and the Horned God&quot;, written by Pat Mills and illustrated by Simon Bisley. Based in Celtic mythology, the Horned God is identified with Cernunnos and is the primary antagonist in a story rich with antagonists. He presents as a Fertility God who has largely lost his mind and become nihilistic. 

The titular smith of the Fay Sampson novel &quot;Black Smith&#x27;s Telling&quot; (1990) is depicted as the leader of a benevolent &quot;Old Religion&quot; that worships a Horned God.
The 1992 &quot;Discworld&quot; novel &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;, by Terry Pratchett, features a King of the Elves who is strongly reminiscent of the Horned God. Although not worshipped by the witches who are the heroines of the book (indeed, quite the reverse), they temporarily ally themselves with him out of necessity.

The 1995 fantasy novel &quot;The Wild Hunt&quot; by Jane Yolen features a supernatural being named the Horned King, who resembles the Horned God, as the novel&#x27;s antagonist.

In the popular video game &quot;Morrowind&quot;, its expansion &quot;Bloodmoon&quot; (2003) has a plot enemy known as Hircine, the Daedric god of the Hunt, who appears as a horned man with the face of a deer skull. He condemned his &quot;hounds&quot; (werewolves) to walk the mortal ground during the Bloodmoon until a champion defeats him or Bloodmoon falls. When in combat, Hircine appears as a horned wolf or bear.

The historical novel &quot;The White Mare&quot; (2004) by Jules Watson, set in Scotland in the year 79 CE, features a scene where the heroine is partnered with a priest of the Horned God during a religious ceremony.

The historical novel &quot;Outlaw&quot; (2009) by Angus Donald, has Robin Hood take part in a violent pagan ceremony where Robin plays the part of Cernunnos, here named as the Horned God. 

Tim Powers&#x27; novella &quot;Salvage and Demolition&quot; (2013) involves a quest for a manuscript written by a being called Aker, who is also designated as the Horned God. 

The 2015 film &quot;The Witch&quot;, which takes place in 17th century New England during the latter end of the early modern inquisition against witchcraft that swept across Europe, deals with an interpretation of the Horned God, which takes the form of Black Phillip, the family goat.

<doc id="14320" wikidata="Q209500" url="?curid=14320" title="Haggis">
<text>Haggis ( ) is a savoury pudding containing sheep&#x27;s pluck (heart, liver, and lungs), minced with chopped onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and cooked while traditionally encased in the animal&#x27;s stomach though now an artificial casing is often used instead. According to the 2001 English edition of the &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot;: &quot;Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour&quot;.

It is believed that food similar to haggis — perishable offal quickly cooked inside an animal&#x27;s stomach, all conveniently available after a hunt — was eaten from ancient times.

Although the name &quot;hagws&quot; or &quot;hagese&quot; was first recorded in England c. 1430, the dish is considered traditionally of Scottish origin. It is even the national dish, as a result of Scots poet Robert Burns&#x27; poem &quot;Address to a Haggis&quot; of 1786. Haggis is traditionally served with &quot;neeps and tatties&quot;, boiled and mashed separately, and a dram (a glass of Scotch whisky), especially as the main course of a Burns supper.

==History and etymology==
Haggis is popularly assumed to be of Scottish origin, but many countries have produced similar dishes with different names. However, the recipes as known and standardised now are distinctly Scottish. The first known written recipes for a dish of the name, made with offal and herbs, are as &quot;hagese&quot;, in the verse cookbook &quot;Liber Cure Cocorum&quot; dating from around 1430 in Lancashire, north west England, and, as &quot;hagws of a schepe&quot; from an English cookbook also of c. 1430.

The earlier (1390) book &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; by Richard II&#x27;s master cooks includes a dish of grated meat in a pig&#x27;s caul, without using such a name. 

The Scottish poem &quot;Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy&quot;, which is dated before 1520 (the generally accepted date prior to the death of William Dunbar, one of the composers), refers to &quot;haggeis&quot;.

An early printed recipe for haggis appears in 1615 in &quot;The English Huswife&quot; by Gervase Markham. It contains a section entitled &quot;Skill in Oate meale&quot;: &quot;The use and vertues of these two severall kinds of Oate-meales in maintaining the Family, they are so many (according to the many customes of many Nations) that it is almost impossible to recken all&quot;; and then proceeds to give a description of &quot;oat-meale mixed with blood, and the Liver of either Sheepe, Calfe or Swine, maketh that pudding which is called the Haggas or Haggus, of whose goodnesse it is in vaine to boast, because there is hardly to be found a man that doth not affect them.&quot; (Gervase Markham, &quot;The English Huswife&quot;)

Food writer Alan Davidson suggests that the ancient Romans were the first known to have made products of the haggis type. Haggis was &quot;born of necessity, as a way to utilize the least expensive cuts of meat and the innards as well&quot;.

Clarissa Dickson Wright says that it &quot;came to Scotland in a longship [i.e., from Scandinavia] even before Scotland was a single nation&quot;. She cites etymologist Walter William Skeat as further suggestion of possible Scandinavian origins: Skeat claimed that the &quot;hag–&quot; element of the word is derived from the Old Norse or the Old Icelandic &quot;hoggva&quot; ( meaning &#x27;to chop&#x27; in modern Icelandic), Modern Scots &quot;hag&quot;, meaning &#x27;to hew&#x27; or strike with a sharp weapon, relating to the chopped-up contents of the dish.

In her book &quot;The Haggis: A Little History&quot;, Dickson Wright suggests that haggis was invented as a way of cooking quick-spoiling offal near the site of a hunt, without the need to carry along an additional cooking vessel. The liver and kidneys could be grilled directly over a fire, but this treatment was unsuitable for the stomach, intestines, or lungs. Chopping up the lungs and stuffing the stomach with them and whatever fillers might have been on hand, then boiling the assembly – probably in a vessel made from the animal&#x27;s hide – was one way to make sure these parts were not wasted.

==Folklore==
In the absence of hard facts as to haggis&#x27; origins, popular folklore has provided some notions. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish cattle drovers. When the men left the Highlands to drive their cattle to market in Edinburgh, the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the glens. They used the ingredients that were most readily available in their homes and conveniently packaged them in a sheep&#x27;s stomach allowing for easy transport during the journey. Other speculations have been based on Scottish slaughtering practices. When a chieftain or laird required an animal to be slaughtered for meat (whether sheep or cattle) the workmen were allowed to keep the offal as their share.

A joke sometimes maintained is that a haggis is a small Scottish animal with longer legs on one side, so that it can run around the steep hills of the Scottish highlands without falling over. According to one poll, 33 percent of American visitors to Scotland believed haggis to be an animal.

==Modern use==
Haggis is traditionally served as part of the Burns supper on or near January 25, the birthday of Scotland&#x27;s national poet Robert Burns. Burns wrote the poem &quot;Address to a Haggis&quot;, which starts &quot;Fair fa&#x27; your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o&#x27; the puddin-race!&quot; In Burns&#x27;s lifetime haggis was a common dish of the poor as it was nourishing yet very cheap, being made from leftover parts of sheep otherwise discarded.

Haggis is widely available in supermarkets in Scotland all year, with cheaper brands normally packed in artificial casings, rather than stomachs. Sometimes haggis is sold in tins or a container which can be cooked in a microwave or conventional oven. Some commercial haggis is largely made from pig, rather than sheep, offal. Kosher haggis, not only pork-free but fully conformant to Jewish dietary laws, is produced.

Haggis is often served in Scottish fast-food establishments, in the shape of a large sausage and deep fried in batter. Together with chips, this comprises a &quot;haggis supper&quot;. A &quot;haggis burger&quot; is a patty of fried haggis served on a bun. A &quot;haggis pakora&quot; is another deep fried variant, available in some Indian restaurants in Scotland. Haggis can be used as an ingredient in other dishes, even pizza, rather than the main part of a dish.

A traditional haggis recipe describes haggis as &quot;sheep&#x27;s &#x27;pluck&#x27; (heart, liver, and lungs), minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and traditionally encased in the animal&#x27;s stomach and boiled&quot;. Ingredients are sheep stomach, heart and lungs of one lamb, onions, oatmeal, salt, pepper, stock, and water, with optional ingredients dried coriander, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It can be boiled, baked, or deep fried.

In the north-east of Scotland, from Aberdeen northwards, in addition to the customary neeps and tatties, haggis is commonly served with mince.

===Vegetarian===
Vegetarian haggis was first available commercially in 1984, and now can account for between 25% and 40% of haggis sales. It substitutes various pulses, nuts and vegetables for the meat. Oats and barley may be included as may different types of lentils, split peas, adzuki beans, kidney beans, borlotti beans, peanuts, other nuts and mushrooms, onions, and carrots.

==Outside Scotland==
Haggis remains popular with Scottish immigrants in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, owing to the strong influence of Scottish culture, especially for Burns Suppers. It can be made in any country, but is sometimes imported from Scotland.

=== Legality ===
In 1971, it became illegal to import haggis into the US from the UK due to a ban on food containing sheep lung, which constitutes 10–15% of the traditional recipe. The ban encompasses all lungs, as fluids such as stomach acid and phlegm may enter the lung during slaughter. The situation was further complicated in 1989 when all UK beef and lamb was banned from importation to the US due to a BSE crisis. The ban on importing British lamb to the US was lifted in 2022 but the ban on food containing sheep lung remained in force. 

As haggis cannot be exported to the United States, it is instead made there, sometimes by Scottish companies. In one such use, which is stated to be otherwise the same 150-year-old recipe having the same ingredients as in Scotland, sheep lung is not used and the casing is artificial rather than stomach.

<doc id="14321" wikidata="Q215777" url="?curid=14321" title="Hank Aaron">
<text>Henry Louis Aaron (February 5, 1934 – January 22, 2021), nicknamed &quot;Hammer&quot; or &quot;Hammerin&#x27; Hank&quot;, was an American professional baseball right fielder who played 23 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 1954 through 1976. Considered one of the greatest baseball players in history, he spent 21 seasons with the Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves in the National League (NL) and two seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers in the American League (AL). At the time of his retirement, Aaron held most of the game&#x27;s key career power-hitting records. He broke the long-standing MLB record for career home runs held by Babe Ruth and remained the career leader for 33 years, until Barry Bonds surpassed his famous total of 755 in 2007. He hit 24 or more home runs every year from 1955 through 1973 and is one of only two players to hit 30 or more home runs in a season at least fifteen times.

Aaron holds the MLB records for the most career runs batted in (RBIs) (2,297), extra base hits (1,477), and total bases (6,856). Aaron is also third all-time for career hits (3,771) and fifth in runs scored (2,174). He is one of only four players to have at least 17 seasons with 150 or more hits. Aaron&#x27;s ability as a hitter can be illustrated by his still having over 3,000 hits even without counting any of his home runs. He was an NL All-Star for 20 seasons and an AL All-Star for one season, and he holds the record for the most All-Star selections (25), while sharing the record for most All-Star Games played (24) with Willie Mays and Stan Musial. He was a three-time Gold Glove winner, and in 1957, he won the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award when the Milwaukee Braves won the World Series.

Aaron was born and raised in and around Mobile, Alabama, one of eight children. He appeared briefly in the Negro American League and in minor league baseball before starting his major league career. By his final MLB season, Aaron was the last former Negro league baseball player on a major league roster. During his time in Major League Baseball, and especially during his run for the home run record, Aaron and his family endured extensive racist threats. His experiences fueled his activism during the civil rights movement.

Aaron was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1982 and Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1988. In 1999, MLB introduced the Hank Aaron Award to recognize the top offensive players in each league. That same year, he was one of 30 baseball players elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. After his retirement, Aaron held front office roles with the Atlanta Braves, including the senior vice president. He resided near Atlanta until his death in 2021.

==Early life==
Aaron was born in Mobile, Alabama, to Herbert Aaron Sr. and Estella (Pritchett) Aaron. He had seven siblings. Tommie Aaron, one of his brothers, also went on to play Major League Baseball. By the time Aaron retired, he and his brother held the record for most career home runs by a pair of siblings (768).

While he was born in a section of Mobile referred to as &quot;Down the Bay&quot;, he spent most of his youth in Toulminville. Aaron grew up in a poor family. His family could not afford baseball equipment, so he practiced by hitting bottle caps with sticks. He would create his own bats and balls out of materials he found on the streets. His boyhood idol was baseball star Jackie Robinson. Aaron attended Central High School as a freshman and a sophomore. Like most high schools, they did not have organized baseball, so he played outfield and third base for the Mobile Black Bears, a semipro team. Aaron was a member of the Boy Scouts of America.

Although he batted cross-handed (as a right-handed hitter, with his left hand above his right), Aaron established himself as a power hitter. As a result, in 1949, at the age of 15, Aaron had his first tryout with an MLB franchise, the Brooklyn Dodgers; however, he did not make the team. After this, Aaron returned to school to finish his secondary education, attending the Josephine Allen Institute, a private high school in Alabama. During his junior year, Aaron joined the Prichard Athletics, an independent Negro league team, followed by the Mobile Black Bears, another independent Negro league team. While on the Bears, Aaron earned $3 per game ($ today), which was a dollar more than he got while on the Athletics.

==Professional career==
===Negro and minor leagues===
On November 20, 1951, baseball scout Ed Scott signed Aaron to a contract on behalf of the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro American League, where he played for three months.

He started play as a , shortstop, and earned $200 per month. As a result of his standout play with the Indianapolis Clowns, Aaron received two offers from MLB teams via telegram, one from the New York Giants and the other from the Boston Braves. Years later, Aaron remembered:

I had the Giants&#x27; contract in my hand. But the Braves offered fifty dollars a month more. That&#x27;s the only thing that kept Willie Mays and me from being teammates – fifty dollars.

While with the Clowns he experienced racism. Of a time his team was in Washington, D.C. Aaron recalled:
We had breakfast while we were waiting for the rain to stop, and I can still envision sitting with the Clowns in a restaurant behind Griffith Stadium and hearing them break all the plates in the kitchen after we finished eating. What a horrible sound. Even as a kid, the irony of it hit me: here we were in the capital in the land of freedom and equality, and they had to destroy the plates that had touched the forks that had been in the mouths of black men. If dogs had eaten off those plates, they&#x27;d have washed them.

The Howe Sports Bureau credits Aaron with a .366 batting average in 26 official Negro league games, with five home runs, 33 runs batted in (RBIs), 41 hits, and nine stolen bases.

The Braves purchased Aaron&#x27;s contract from the Clowns for $10,000, which GM John Quinn thought was a steal, as he stated that he felt that Aaron was a $100,000 property. On June 12, 1952, Aaron signed with Braves&#x27; scout Dewey Griggs. During this time, he picked up the nickname &quot;pork chops&quot; because it &quot;was the only thing I knew to order off the menu&quot;. A teammate later said, &quot;the man ate pork chops three meals a day, two for breakfast&quot;.

The Braves assigned Aaron to the Eau Claire Bears, the Braves&#x27; Northern League Class-C farm team. The 1952 season proved to be very beneficial for Aaron. Playing in the infield, Aaron continued to develop as a ballplayer and made the Northern League&#x27;s All-Star team. He broke his habit of hitting cross-handed and adopted the standard hitting technique. By the end of the season, he had performed so well that the league made him the unanimous choice for Rookie of the Year. Although he appeared in just 87 games, he scored 89 runs, had 116 hits, nine home runs, and 61 RBI. In addition, Aaron hit for a .336 batting average. During his minor league experience, he was very homesick and faced constant racism, but his brother, Herbert Jr., told him not to give up the opportunity.

In 1953, the Braves promoted him to the Jacksonville Braves, their Class-A affiliate in the South Atlantic League. Helped by Aaron&#x27;s performance, the Braves won the league championship that year. Aaron led the league in runs (115), hits (208), doubles (36), RBIs (125), total bases (338), and batting average (.362). He won the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award, and had such a dominant year that one sportswriter was prompted to say, &quot;Henry Aaron led the league in everything except hotel accommodations.&quot; Aaron&#x27;s time with the Braves did not come without problems. He was one of the first African Americans to play in the league. The 1950s were a period of racial segregation in parts of the United States, especially the southeastern portion of the country. When Aaron traveled around Jacksonville, Florida, and the surrounding areas, he was often separated from his team because of Jim Crow laws. In most circumstances, the team was responsible for arranging housing and meals for its players, but Aaron often had to make his own arrangements. The Braves&#x27; manager, Ben Geraghty, tried his best to help Aaron on and off the field. Former Braves minor league player and sportswriter Pat Jordan said, &quot;Aaron gave [Geraghty] much of the credit for his own swift rise to stardom.&quot;

That same year, Aaron met his future wife, Barbara Lucas. The night they met, Lucas decided to attend the Braves&#x27; game. Aaron singled, doubled, and hit a home run in the game. On October 6, Aaron and Lucas married. In 1958, Aaron&#x27;s wife noted that during the off-season he liked &quot;to sit and watch those shooting westerns&quot;. He also enjoyed cooking and fishing.

Aaron spent the winter of 1953 playing in Puerto Rico. Mickey Owen, the team&#x27;s manager, helped Aaron with his batting stance. Until then, Aaron had hit most pitches to left field or center field, but after working with Owen, Aaron was able to hit the ball more effectively all over the field. During his stay in Puerto Rico, Owen also helped Aaron transition from second base to the outfield. Aaron had not played well at second base, but Owen noted that Aaron could catch fly balls and throw them well from the outfield to the infield.

The stint in Puerto Rico also allowed Aaron to avoid being drafted into military service. Though the Korean War was over, people were still being drafted. The Braves were able to speak to the draft board, making the case that Aaron could be the player to integrate the Southern Association the following season with the Atlanta Crackers. The board appears to have been convinced, as Aaron was not drafted.

===Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves (1954–1974)===
In 1954, Aaron attended spring training with the major league club. Although he was on the roster of its farm club, Milwaukee manager Charley Grimm later stated, &quot;From the start, he did so well I knew we were going to have to carry him.&quot; On March 13, 1954, Milwaukee Braves left fielder Bobby Thomson fractured his ankle while sliding into second base during a spring training game. The next day, Aaron made his first spring training start for the Braves major league team, playing in left field and hitting a home run. This led Aaron to a major league contract, signed on the final day of spring training, and a Braves uniform with the number five. On April 13, he made his major league debut and was hitless in five at-bats against the Cincinnati Redlegs. In the same game, Eddie Mathews hit two home runs, the first of a record 863 home runs the pair would hit as teammates. On April 15, Aaron collected his first major league hit, a double off St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Vic Raschi. Aaron hit his first major league home run on April 23, also off Raschi. In 122 games, Aaron batted .280 with 13 home runs before he suffered a fractured ankle on September 5. He then changed his number to 44, which would turn out to look like a &quot;lucky number&quot; for the slugger. Aaron would hit 44 home runs in four different seasons, and he hit his record-breaking 715th career home run off Dodgers pitcher Al Downing, who coincidentally also wore number 44.

At this point, Aaron was known to family and friends primarily as &quot;Henry&quot;. Braves&#x27; public relations director Don Davidson, observing Aaron&#x27;s quiet, reserved nature, began referring to him publicly as &quot;Hank&quot; in order to suggest more accessibility. The nickname quickly gained currency, but &quot;Henry&quot; continued to be cited frequently in the media, both sometimes appearing in the same article, and Aaron would answer to either one. During his rookie year, his other well-known nicknames, &quot;Hammerin&#x27; Hank&quot; (by teammates) and &quot;Bad Henry&quot; (by opposing pitchers) are reported to have arisen.

While living in Milwaukee, Aaron resided in the Prinz House in Historic Brewers Hill.

Considerably later in his career, Aaron coined &quot;Stone-fingers&quot;, which would prove a popular handle for one of baseball&#x27;s more colorful characters, the famously distance-hitting but defensively challenged first baseman Dick Stuart, reportedly &quot;delight[ing]&quot; even its recipient.

Sal Maglie recommended throwing low curveballs to Aaron. &quot;He&#x27;s going to swing and he&#x27;ll go after almost anything,&quot; Maglie said of the Braves&#x27; slugger. &quot;And he&#x27;ll hit almost anything, so you have to be careful.&quot;

====Prime of his career====

Aaron hit .314 with 27 home runs and 106 RBI in 153 games in 1955. He was named to the NL All-Star roster for the first time; it was the first of a record 21 All-Star selections and first of a record 25 All-Star Game appearances. In 1956, Aaron hit .328 and captured the first of two NL batting titles. He was also named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; NL Player of the Year. In 1957, Aaron won his only NL MVP Award, as he had his first brush with the triple crown. He batted .322, placing third, and led the league in home runs and runs batted in. On September 23, 1957, in Milwaukee, Aaron hit a two-run walk-off home run against the St. Louis Cardinals, clinching the pennant for the Braves. After touching home plate he was carried off the field by his teammates. It is as of yet the only pennant-clinching walk-off home run in major league history in a non-playoff regular-season game. Milwaukee went on to win the World Series against the New York Yankees, the defending champions, four games to three. Aaron did his part by hitting .393 with three homers and seven RBIs. On December 15, 1957, his wife Barbara gave birth to twins. Two days later, one of the children died. In 1958, Aaron hit .326 with 30 home runs and 95 RBI in 153 games. He led the Braves to another pennant, but this time they lost a seven-game World Series to the Yankees. Aaron finished third in the MVP race and he received his first of three Gold Glove Awards. During the next several years, Aaron had some of his best games and best seasons as a major league player. On June 21, 1959, against the San Francisco Giants, he hit three two-run home runs. It was the only time in his career that he hit three home runs in a game.

In 1963, Aaron nearly won the triple crown. He led the league with 44 home runs and 130 RBI and finished third in batting average (.319). In that season, Aaron became the third player to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in a single season, and the first player to record 40 home runs and 30 steals in a season. He again finished third in National League MVP voting. The Braves moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta after the 1965 season. On May 10, 1967, he hit an inside-the-park home run against Jim Bunning in Philadelphia. It was the only inside-the-park home run of his career. In 1968, Aaron was the first Atlanta Braves player to hit his 500th career home run, and in 1970, he was the first Atlanta Brave to reach 3,000 career hits.

====Home run milestones and 3,000th hit====
During his days in Atlanta, Aaron reached several milestones; he was only the eighth player ever to hit 500 career home runs, with his 500th coming against Mike McCormick of the San Francisco Giants on July 14, 1968—exactly one year after former Milwaukee Braves teammate Eddie Mathews had hit his 500th. Aaron was, at the time, the second-youngest player to reach the milestone. On July 31, 1969, Aaron hit his 537th home run, passing Mickey Mantle&#x27;s total; this moved Aaron into third place on the career home run list, after Willie Mays and Babe Ruth. At the end of the 1969 season, Aaron again finished third in the MVP voting.

In 1970, Aaron reached two more career milestones. On May 17, Aaron collected his 3,000th hit, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, the team against which he played in his first major-league game. Aaron established the record for most seasons with thirty or more home runs in the National League. On April 27, 1971, Aaron hit his 600th career home run, the third major league player ever to do so. On July 13, Aaron hit a home run in the All-Star Game (played at Detroit&#x27;s Tiger Stadium) for the first time. He hit his 40th home run of the season against the Giants&#x27; Jerry Johnson on September 10, which established a National League record for most seasons with 40 or more home runs (seven). At age 37, he hit a career-high 47 home runs during the season (along with a career-high .669 slugging percentage) and finished third in MVP voting for the sixth time. During the strike-shortened season of 1972, Aaron tied and then surpassed Willie Mays for second place on the career home run list. Aaron also drove in the 2,000th run of his career and hit a home run in the first All-Star game played in Atlanta. As the year came to a close, Aaron broke Stan Musial&#x27;s major-league record for total bases (6,134). He finished the season with 673 career home runs.

====Breaking Ruth&#x27;s career home run record====

Aaron himself downplayed the &quot;chase&quot; to surpass Babe Ruth, while baseball enthusiasts and the national media grew increasingly excited as he closed in on the 714 career home runs record. Aaron received thousands of letters every week during the summer of 1973, including hate mail; he ended up asking a secretary working for the Braves, Carla Koplin, to help him sort through it.

Aaron (then age 39) hit 40 home runs in 392 at-bats, ending the 1973 season one home run short of the record. He hit home run number 713 on September 29, 1973, and with one day remaining in the season, many expected him to tie the record. But in his final game that year, playing against the Houston Astros (managed by Leo Durocher, who had once roomed with Babe Ruth), he was unable to achieve this. After the game, Aaron said his only fear was that he might not live to see the 1974 season.

He was the recipient of death threats and a large assortment of hate mail during the 1973–1974 offseason from people who did not want to see Aaron break Ruth&#x27;s nearly home run record. The threats extended to those providing positive press coverage of Aaron. Lewis Grizzard, then-executive sports editor of &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot;, reported receiving numerous phone calls calling journalists &quot;nigger lovers&quot; for covering Aaron&#x27;s chase. While preparing the massive coverage of the home run record, Grizzard quietly had an obituary written, afraid that Aaron might be murdered.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; pointedly summarized the racist vitriol that Aaron was forced to endure:

At the end of the 1973 season, Aaron received a plaque from the U.S. Postal Service for receiving more mail (930,000 pieces) than any person excluding politicians. Aaron received an outpouring of public support in response to the bigotry. In August 1973, &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoonist Charles Schulz drew a series of strips in which Snoopy attempts to break Babe Ruth&#x27;s record, only to be besieged with hate mail. In the strip published August 11, Lucy remarked to Snoopy: &quot;Hank Aaron is a great player... but you! If you break Babe Ruth&#x27;s record, it&#x27;ll be a disgrace!&quot; Coincidentally, Snoopy was only one home run short of tying the record (and finished the season as such when Charlie Brown got picked off second base during Snoopy&#x27;s last at-bat), and as it turned out, Aaron finished the 1973 season one home run short of Ruth. Babe Ruth&#x27;s widow, Claire, denounced the racism and declared that her husband would have enthusiastically cheered Aaron&#x27;s attempt at the record. As the 1974 season began, Aaron&#x27;s pursuit of the record caused a small controversy. The Braves opened the season on the road in Cincinnati with a three-game series against the Cincinnati Reds. Braves management wanted him to break the record in Atlanta and was therefore going to have Aaron sit out the first three games of the season. But Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn ruled that he had to play two games in the first series. He played two out of three and tied Babe Ruth&#x27;s record on April 4, 1974, in his first at-bat on his first swing of the season—off Reds pitcher Jack Billingham, but did not hit another home run in the series.

The Braves returned to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, a crowd of 53,775 people showed up for the game—a Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally on NBC. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home run number 715 off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Al Downing. Although Dodgers outfielder Bill Buckner nearly went over the outfield fence trying to catch it, the ball flew into the Braves&#x27; bullpen and the First National Bank advertisement sign in left-center field, where relief pitcher Tom House caught it. While cannons were fired in celebration, two college students sprinted onto the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the bases, temporarily startling him. As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron&#x27;s parents ran onto the field as well. Afterwards, Aaron remarked how &quot;I never knew my mother could hug so tight,&quot; though he later learned that Aaron&#x27;s mother kept hugging him because she was worried someone could try to shoot Aaron, and she thought nobody would try to shoot him if she was hugging him. Braves announcer Milo Hamilton, calling the game on WSB radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record:

Henry Aaron, in the second inning, walked and scored. He&#x27;s sittin&#x27; on 714. Here&#x27;s the pitch by Downing. Swinging. There&#x27;s a drive into left-center field. That ball is gonna be-eee... Outta here! It&#x27;s gone! It&#x27;s 715! There&#x27;s a new home run champion of all time, and it&#x27;s Henry Aaron! The fireworks are going. Henry Aaron is coming around third. His teammates are at home plate. And listen to this crowd!

Meanwhile, Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully addressed the racial tension—or apparent lack thereof—in his call of the home run:

===Milwaukee Brewers (1975–1976)===

On October 2, 1974, Aaron hit his 733rd home run in his last at-bat as a Braves player. Aaron commented after the game that it was his last time as a player in Atlanta as his contract had expired. While he considered retirement, he said that he was willing to return to baseball for another year. He had also said that he would be interested in serving as a team&#x27;s general manager, someone who would make decisions and not a &quot;house boy&quot;. The Braves offered Aaron a position with the team when he retired, but the role would be more in public relations, rather than one where he could evaluate talent.

At the end of the season, Aaron, who had a prior relationship with Brewers owner Bud Selig, requested a trade to Milwaukee. He was acquired by the Milwaukee Brewers for Dave May thirty-one days later on November 2. Minor league right-handed pitcher Roger Alexander was sent to the Braves to complete the transaction at the Winter Meetings one month later on December 2. The trade re-united Aaron with former teammate Del Crandall, who was now managing the Brewers. He signed a two-year contract with the Brewers for $240,000 per year. Playing in the American League allowed Aaron to serve as a designated hitter rather than play in the field.

On May 1, 1975, Aaron broke baseball&#x27;s all-time RBI record, previously held by Ruth with 2,213. That year, he also played in his last and 24th All-Star Game (25th All-Star Game selection); he lined out to Dave Concepción as a pinch-hitter in the second inning. This All-Star Game, like the first one he played in 1955, was before a home crowd at Milwaukee County Stadium.

Aaron hit his 755th and final home run on July 20, 1976, at Milwaukee County Stadium off Dick Drago of the California Angels, which stood as the MLB career home run record for 31 years until it was broken in 2007 by Barry Bonds. Over the course of his record-breaking 23-year career, Aaron had a batting average of .305 and 164 hits a season, while averaging nearly 33 home runs and 100 RBIs a year. He had 100+ RBIs in a season 11 times, including 5 years in a row between 1959-63.

In 17 postseason games, including 2 World Series (1957, &#x27;58) and the 1969 NLCS, Aaron batted a strong .362 (25-for-69) with 11 runs scored, 4 doubles, 1 triple, 6 home runs, 16 RBI, 5 walks, on-base percentage of .405, slugging percentage of .710, and on-base plus slugging percentage of 1.116.

==Post-playing career==
After the 1976 season, Aaron rejoined the Braves as an executive. On August 1, 1982, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, having received votes on 97.8 percent of the ballots, second only to Ty Cobb, who had received votes on 98.2% of the ballot in the inaugural 1936 Hall of Fame election. Aaron was then named the Braves&#x27; vice president and director of player development. This made him one of the first minorities in Major League Baseball upper-level management.

In December 1980, Aaron became senior vice president and assistant to the Braves&#x27; president. He was the corporate vice president of community relations for Turner Broadcasting System, a member of the company&#x27;s board of directors, and the vice president of business development for The Airport Network. On January 21, 2007, Major League Baseball announced the sale of the Atlanta Braves. In that announcement, Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig also announced that Aaron would be playing a major role in the management of the Braves, forming programs through major league baseball that will encourage the influx of minorities into baseball. Aaron founded the Hank Aaron Rookie League program.

Shortly before the start of the 2002 baseball season, Aaron joined San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds—on the heels of his record-shattering performance the season before—to make a television commercial that aired during Super Bowl XXXVI, in which Aaron jokingly tried to persuade Bonds to retire before breaking the record.

As Bonds began to close in on the record during the 2007 season, Aaron let it be known that, although he recognized Bonds&#x27; achievements, he would not be present when Bonds broke the record. There was considerable speculation that this was a snubbing of Bonds based on the widespread belief that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs and steroids to aid his achievement. However, some observers looked back on Aaron&#x27;s personal history, pointing out that he had downplayed his own breaking of Babe Ruth&#x27;s all-time record and suggesting Aaron was simply treating Bonds in a similar fashion. In a later interview with Atlanta sportscasting personality Chris Dimino, Aaron made it clear his reluctance to attend any celebration of a new home run record was based upon his personal conviction that baseball is not about breaking records, but simply playing to the best of one&#x27;s potential. After Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run on August 7, 2007, Aaron made a surprise appearance on the JumboTron video screen at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco to congratulate Bonds on his accomplishment:

Aaron&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;I Had A Hammer&quot;, co-written with the help of writer Lonnie Wheeler, was published in 1990 and was a finalist for the Casey Award. The book&#x27;s title is a play on his nickname, &quot;The Hammer&quot; or &quot;Hammerin&#x27; Hank&quot;, and the title of the folk song &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot;. Aaron owned Hank Aaron BMW of south Atlanta in Union City, Georgia, where he included an autographed baseball with every car sold. Aaron also owned Mini, Land Rover, Toyota, Hyundai, and Honda dealerships throughout Georgia, as part of the Hank Aaron Automotive Group. Aaron sold all but the Toyota dealership in McDonough in 2007. Additionally, Aaron owned a chain of 30 restaurants around the country.

==Personal life==

Aaron&#x27;s first marriage was to Barbara Lucas in 1953. They had five children: Gary, Lary, Dorinda, Gaile, and Hank Jr. He divorced Barbara in 1971 and married Billye Suber Williams on November 13, 1973. Aaron adopted Billye&#x27;s daughter, Ceci, from her first marriage to civil rights activist Samuel Woodrow Williams.

Despite being publicly and professionally known as &quot;Hank,&quot; Aaron preferred to go by his given name, &quot;Henry.&quot; The former name came around when Don Davidson, the public relations director for the Milwaukee Braves, began to refer to him as such in an effort to make the quiet, soft-spoken player seem more accessible to the fans and the press.

Aaron&#x27;s great–nephew, Kimani Vidal, was selected by the Los Angeles Chargers in the 2024 NFL draft.

=== Religion ===
Born and raised a Baptist, Aaron converted to Catholicism in 1959 at age 25, together with his family. He and his wife first became interested in the faith after the birth of their first child, whom they baptized immediately. A friendship with a priest later helped lead to Hank and his wife&#x27;s conversion. Aaron was known to frequently read Thomas à Kempis&#x27; 15th-century book &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;, which he kept in his locker.

In an interview in 1991, Aaron credited the priest, Fr. Michael Sablica, with helping him grow as a person in the 1950s. &quot;He taught me what life was all about. But he was more than just a religious friend of mine, he was a friend because he talked as if he was not a priest sometimes.&quot; Active in the civil rights movement, the priest encouraged Aaron to be more publicly vocal about causes he believed in.

Sablica also encouraged him to &quot;attend Mass every Sunday&quot; during Spring Training, to which he responded with the racist realities of the day: &quot;[In Bradenton], they won&#x27;t let me go to Mass.&quot; Sablica said in an interview that he wouldn&#x27;t have blamed Aaron if he stopped practicing. Aaron indeed attended Friendship Baptist Church toward the end of his life, noting in his autobiography that he didn&#x27;t remain a practicing Catholic for very long after converting.

=== Hobbies and health ===
Aaron was a long-time fan of the Cleveland Browns, having attended many games in disguise in their &quot;Dawg Pound&quot; seating section.

In 1986, Hank Aaron made a guest appearance in &quot;Just Another Fox in the Crowd&quot;, episode 30 of &quot;Crazy Like a Fox&quot;.

In 1994, Aaron and his wife established the Chasing the Dream Foundation which awarded the Hank Aaron Chasing The Dream Scholarship to members of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America.

Aaron lived in the Atlanta area. In July 2013, media reported that his home was burglarized with jewelry and two BMW vehicles having been stolen. The cars were later recovered.

Aaron suffered from arthritis and had a partial hip replacement after a fall in 2014.

On January 5, 2021, Aaron publicly received a COVID-19 vaccination with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at the Morehouse School of Medicine at Atlanta, Georgia. He and several other African American public figures, including activist Joe Beasley, Andrew Young, and Louis Sullivan, did so to demonstrate the safety of the vaccine and encourage other black Americans to do the same.

== Death ==
Aaron died in his sleep in his Atlanta residence on January 22, 2021, at the age of 86. The manner of death was listed as natural causes.

His funeral was held on January 27 at the Friendship Baptist Church. Amongst the attendees were former President Bill Clinton, former baseball commissioner Bud Selig, and former Atlanta mayor Andrew Young. After the funeral, Aaron&#x27;s body was interred at South-View Cemetery in Atlanta.

=== Tributes ===
Upon Aaron&#x27;s death, the sports world expressed their condolences to him. Many current or former athletes and team owners such as MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, Magic Johnson, David Ortiz, Dusty Baker, Eduardo Pérez, Mike Trout, and Baseball Hall of Fame chairman Jane Forbes Clark paid tribute to him. Fans paid tribute to Aaron by placing flowers in front of the home run wall where he hit his 715th home run at the former site of Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and in front of his statue at Truist Park.

Politicians also paid tribute to him. The Mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms released the following statement on his death:

Georgia governor Brian Kemp ordered flags in the state of Georgia to be lowered half-staff in honor of him.

U.S. President Joe Biden paid tribute to Aaron by releasing a statement calling him &quot;an American hero&quot;. He also received tributes from former presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.

The Atlanta Braves honored Hank Aaron during the 2021 season by including his jersey number 44 on the back of the team caps along with Phil Niekro&#x27;s jersey number, 35 (who died one month earlier in December 2020). They also painted 44 in the midfield at Truist Park.

At Game 3 of the 2021 World Series in Truist Park, a pregame ceremony was held honoring Aaron where his son Hank Aaron Jr. threw out a ceremonial first pitch. After the Braves won the 2021 World Series, Aaron was honored in the design of the team&#x27;s World Series championship ring, which includes 755 total diamonds to commemorate Aaron&#x27;s career home runs, and 44 emerald-cut diamonds to represent Aaron&#x27;s jersey number with the Braves.

==Awards and honors==

In 1982, Aaron was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame during his first year of eligibility.

Aaron was awarded the Spingarn Medal in 1976, from the NAACP. In 1977, Aaron received the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award. In 1988, Aaron was inducted into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame for his time spent on the Eau Claire Bears, Milwaukee Braves, and Milwaukee Brewers.

In 1999, Major League Baseball created the Hank Aaron Award, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Aaron&#x27;s surpassing of Babe Ruth&#x27;s career home run mark of 714 home runs and to honor Aaron&#x27;s contributions to baseball. The award is given annually to the baseball hitters voted the most effective in each respective league. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Aaron on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.

When the city of Atlanta was converting Centennial Olympic Stadium into a new baseball stadium, many local residents hoped the stadium would be named for Aaron. When the stadium was instead named Turner Field (after Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner), a section of Capitol Avenue running past the stadium was renamed Hank Aaron Drive. The stadium&#x27;s street number is 755, after Aaron&#x27;s total number of home runs; the 755 street number was retained for Turner Field&#x27;s replacement, Truist Park. In April 1997, a new baseball facility for the AA Mobile Bay Bears constructed in Aaron&#x27;s hometown of Mobile, Alabama was named Hank Aaron Stadium. Georgia State University acquired Turner Field and has since rebuilt it as Center Parc Stadium, in 2017, and university officials plan to build a new baseball park on the former Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium site, incorporating the left field wall where Aaron hit his record-breaking home run.

On February 5, 1999, at his 65th birthday celebration, Major League Baseball announced the introduction of the Hank Aaron Award. The award honors the best overall offensive performer in the American and National League. It was the first major award to be introduced in more than thirty years and had the distinction of being the first award named after a player who was still alive. Later that year, he ranked fifth on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

In June 2000, Tufts University awarded Aaron an honorary Doctor of Public Service. In July 2000 and again in July 2002, Aaron threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, played at Turner Field and Miller Park now named American Family Field, respectively.

On January 8, 2001, Aaron was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor, from President George W. Bush in June 2002. In 2001, a recreational trail in Milwaukee connecting American Family Field with Lake Michigan along the Menomonee River was dedicated as the Hank Aaron State Trail. Aaron attended the dedication. Aaron was on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.

In 2002, Aaron was honored with the &quot;Lombardi Award of Excellence&quot; from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Vince Lombardi&#x27;s legacy and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the coach.

Aaron dedicated the new exhibit &quot;Hank Aaron: Chasing the Dream&quot; at the Baseball Hall of Fame on April 25, 2009. Statues of Aaron stand outside the front entrance of both Turner Field and American Family Field. There is also a statue of him as an 18-year-old shortstop outside Carson Park in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, where he played his first season in the Braves&#x27; minor league system.

He was named a 2010 Georgia Trustee by the Georgia Historical Society, in conjunction with the Governor of Georgia, to recognize accomplishments and community service that reflect the ideals of the founding body of Trustees, which governed the Georgia colony from 1732 to 1752.

In 2011, the President of Princeton University Shirley M. Tilghman awarded an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree to Aaron.

In November 2015, Aaron was one of the five inaugural recipients of the Portrait of a Nation Prize, an award granted by the National Portrait Gallery in recognition of &quot;exemplary achievements in the fields of civil rights, business, entertainment, science, and sports.&quot;

In January 2016, Aaron received the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Rosette from Akihito, the Emperor of Japan.

The Elite Development Invitational, a youth baseball tournament organized by the Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association to increase diversity in the sport, was renamed the Hank Aaron Invitational for the 2019 season.

After Aaron&#x27;s death, the Atlanta Falcons of the NFL and Atlanta United of MLS retired his No. 44 for the 2021 season (the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA had already retired No. 44 for Pete Maravich). Additionally, Gwinnett County minor league baseball teams, the Triple-A Gwinnett Stripers (2021 season) and Double-A Atlanta Gladiators (2021–22 season), also temporarily retired No. 44 in Aaron&#x27;s honor, as did the Braves&#x27; other minor league affiliates.

In April 2021, the Forrest Hill Academy was renamed the Hank Aaron New Beginnings Academy. The alternative high school had been named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, a general in the Confederate Army and the Ku Klux Klan&#x27;s first Grand Wizard.

In 2022, a recording of the WSB broadcast of the April 8, 1974, Braves–Dodgers game in which Aaron hit his 715th home run was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry. In May of the same year, Tulane University gave Aaron a posthumous honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, the first posthumous honorary degree ever awarded by the university. It was presented during the university&#x27;s unified commencement ceremony and was accepted on his behalf by his widow Billye.

On July 31, 2024 USPS released stamp honoring Aaron.

<doc id="14322" wikidata="Q162808" url="?curid=14322" title="Holy Grail">
<text>The Holy Grail (, , , ) is a treasure that serves as an important motif in Arthurian literature. Various traditions describe the Holy Grail as a cup, dish, or stone with miraculous healing powers, sometimes providing eternal youth or sustenance in infinite abundance, often guarded in the custody of the Fisher King and located in the hidden Grail castle. By analogy, any elusive object or goal of great significance may be perceived as a &quot;holy grail&quot; by those seeking such.

A mysterious &quot;grail&quot; (Old French: &quot;graal&quot; or &quot;greal&quot;), wondrous but not unequivocally holy, first appears in &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, an unfinished chivalric romance written by Chrétien de Troyes around 1190. Chrétien&#x27;s story inspired many continuations, translators and interpreters in the later-12th and early-13th centuries, including Wolfram von Eschenbach, who portrayed the Grail as a stone in &quot;Parzival&quot;. The Christian, Celtic or possibly other origins of the Arthurian grail trope are uncertain and have been debated among literary scholars and historians.

Writing soon after Chrétien, Robert de Boron in &quot;&quot; portrayed the Grail as Jesus&#x27;s vessel from the Last Supper, which Joseph of Arimathea used to catch Christ&#x27;s blood at the crucifixion. Thereafter, the Holy Grail became interwoven with the legend of the Holy Chalice, the Last Supper cup, an idea continued in works such as the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; cycle, and subsequently the 15th-century &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. In this form, it is now a popular theme in modern culture, and has become the subject of folklore studies, pseudohistorical writings, works of fiction, and conspiracy theories.

==Etymology==
The word , as it is spelled in its earliest appearances, comes from Old French or , cognate with Old Occitan and Old Catalan , meaning &quot;a cup or bowl of earth, wood, or metal&quot; (or other various types of vessels in different Occitan dialects). The most commonly accepted etymology derives it from Latin or via an earlier form, , a derivative of or , which was, in turn, borrowed from Ancient Greek (, a large wine-mixing vessel). Alternative suggestions include a derivative of , a name for a type of woven basket that came to refer to a dish, or a derivative of Latin meaning by degree&#x27;, &#x27;by stages&#x27;, applied to a dish brought to the table in different stages or services during a meal&quot;.

In the 15th century, English writer John Hardyng invented a fanciful new etymology for Old French (or ), meaning &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, by parsing it as , meaning &quot;royal blood&quot;. This etymology was used by some later medieval British writers such as Thomas Malory, and became prominent in the conspiracy theory developed in the book &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;, in which refers to the Jesus bloodline.

==Medieval literature==
The literature surrounding the Grail can be divided into two groups. The first concerns King Arthur&#x27;s knights visiting the Grail castle or questing after the object. The second concerns the Grail&#x27;s earlier history in the time of Joseph of Arimathea.

The nine works from the first group are:
* &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, a chivalric romance poem by Chrétien de Troyes.
*The Four Continuations of Chrétien&#x27;s unfinished poem, by authors of differing vision, designed to bring the story to a close.
* The , purportedly a prosification of Robert de Boron&#x27;s sequel to his romance poems &quot;&quot; and &quot;Merlin&quot;.
* &quot;Parzival&quot; by Wolfram von Eschenbach, which adapted at least the holiness of Robert&#x27;s Grail into the framework of Chrétien&#x27;s story.
* Welsh romance &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot;, a loose translation of Chrétien&#x27;s poem and the Continuations, with some influence from native Welsh literature. 
* &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, called the &quot;least canonical&quot; Grail romance because of its very different character.
* German poem &quot;Diu Crône&quot; (&quot;The Crown&quot;), in which Gawain, rather than Perceval, achieves the Grail.
* The Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; section of the vast Lancelot-Grail cycle introduced the new Grail hero, Galahad. The &quot;Queste del Saint Graal&quot;, a follow-up part of the cycle, concerns Galahad&#x27;s eventual achievement of the Grail.

Of the second group there are:
*Robert de Boron&#x27;s &quot;Joseph d&#x27;Arimathie&quot;.
* The &quot;Estoire del Saint Graal&quot;, the first part of the Lancelot-Grail cycle (but written after &quot;Lancelot&quot; and the &quot;Queste&quot;), based on Robert&#x27;s tale but expanding it greatly with many new details.
* Verses by Rigaut de Barbezieux, a late 12th or early 13th-century Provençal troubador, where mention is made of Perceval, the lance, and the Grail served.

The Grail was considered a bowl or dish when first described by Chrétien de Troyes. There, it is a processional salver, a tray, used to serve at a feast. Hélinand of Froidmont described a grail as a &quot;wide and deep saucer&quot; (&quot;scutella lata et aliquantulum profunda&quot;); other authors had their own ideas. Robert de Boron portrayed it as the vessel of the Last Supper. &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot; had no Grail as such, presenting the hero instead with a platter containing his kinsman&#x27;s bloody, severed head.

===Chrétien de Troyes===
The Grail is first featured in &quot;Perceval, le Conte du Graal&quot; (&quot;The Story of the Grail&quot;) by Chrétien de Troyes, who claims he was working from a source book given to him by his patron, Count Philip of Flanders. In this incomplete poem, dated sometime between 1180 and 1191, the object has not yet acquired the implications of holiness it would have in later works. While dining in the magical abode of the Fisher King, Perceval witnesses a wondrous procession in which youths carry magnificent objects from one chamber to another, passing before him at each course of the meal. First comes a young man carrying a bleeding lance, then two boys carrying candelabras. Finally, a beautiful young girl emerges bearing an elaborately decorated &quot;graal&quot;, or &quot;grail&quot;. Chrétien&#x27;s Perceval does not achieve the quest, but different authors completed his unfinished story in their own poems known as &quot;Perceval Continuations&quot;, including two alternative endings to the initial successive continuations.

Chrétien refers to this object not as &quot;The Grail&quot; but as &quot;a grail&quot; (&quot;un graal&quot;), showing the word was used, in its earliest literary context, as a common noun. For Chrétien, a grail was a wide, somewhat deep, dish or bowl, interesting because it contained not a pike, salmon, or lamprey, as the audience may have expected for such a container, but a single Communion wafer which provided sustenance for the Fisher King&#x27;s crippled father. Perceval, who had been warned against talking too much, remains silent through all of this and wakes up the next morning alone. He later learns that if he had asked the appropriate questions about what he saw, he would have healed his maimed host, much to his honour. The story of the Wounded King&#x27;s mystical fasting is not unique; several saints were said to have lived without food besides communion, for instance Saint Catherine of Genoa. This may imply that Chrétien intended the Communion wafer to be the significant part of the ritual, and the Grail to be a mere prop. The &quot;First Continuation&quot; seemingly features two grails: a floating dish and a carved head of Jesus.

===Robert de Boron===
Though Chrétien&#x27;s account is the earliest and most influential of all Grail texts, it was in the work of Robert that the Grail truly became the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; and assumed the form most familiar to modern readers in its Christian context. In his verse romance &quot;Joseph d&#x27;Arimathie&quot;, composed between 1191 and 1202, Robert tells the story of Joseph of Arimathea acquiring the chalice of the Last Supper to collect Christ&#x27;s blood upon his removal from the cross. Joseph is thrown in prison, where Christ visits him and explains the mysteries of the blessed cup. Upon his release, Joseph gathers his in-laws and other followers and travels to the west. He founds a dynasty of Grail keepers that eventually includes Perceval.

Perceval himself is the subject of the &quot;Didot-Perceval&quot; (&quot;Perceval en prose&quot;), a prose work presenting a revised and completed version of Chrétien&#x27;s story, but replacing him with Galahad (Galaad) as the principle Grail hero while simultaneously also serving as a continuation to &quot;Joseph&quot; and &quot;Merlin&quot; by Robert de Boron. In &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, another markedly different anonymous prose continuation of Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot;, the Grail is a holy blood relic creating mystical visions and appearing in the form of a hovering chalice, apparently as inspired by de Boron.

===Wolfram von Eschenbach===
In &quot;Parzival&quot;, the author Wolfram von Eschenbach, citing the authority of a certain (probably fictional) Kyot the Provençal, claimed the Grail was a gemstone, the sanctuary of the neutral angels who took neither side during Lucifer&#x27;s rebellion. It is called &quot;Lapis exillis&quot;, which in alchemy is the name of the philosopher&#x27;s stone. In Wolfram&#x27;s telling, the Grail was kept safe at the castle of Munsalvaesche (&quot;mons salvationis&quot;), entrusted to Titurel, the first Grail King. The stone grants eternal life to its guardian; in the end, Parzival replaces the maimed and long suffering Anfortas as the new Grail King, having finally released him by correctly answering his question.

=== Lancelot-Grail ===
The authors of the &quot;Vulgate Cycle&quot; (&quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot;) used the Grail as a symbol of divine grace; the virgin Galahad, illegitimate son of Lancelot and Elaine, the world&#x27;s greatest knight and the Grail Bearer at the castle of Corbenic, is destined to achieve the Grail, his spiritual purity making him a greater warrior than even his illustrious father. The &quot;Queste del Saint Graal&quot; (&quot;The Quest of The Holy Grail&quot;), continuing directly from the expanded prose versions of Robert de Boron&#x27;s stories of &quot;Joseph&quot; and &quot;Merlin&quot;, tells also of the adventures of various Knights of the Round Table in their eponymous quest. Some of them, including Perceval and Bors the Younger, eventually join Galahad as his companions near the successful end of the Grail Quest and are witnesses of his ascension to Heaven.

Alternative versions of the Grail Quest based on that from the &quot;Vulgate Cycle&quot; were included in the &quot;Prose Tristan&quot; and the &quot;Post-Vulgate Cycle&quot;. Galahad and the interpretation of the Grail involving him were picked up in the 15th century by Thomas Malory in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, and remain popular today. Based closely on the &quot;Vulgate Cycle&quot; in an abridged form, Malory&#x27;s telling accordingly elevates Galahad above Perceval (Percivale), the latter reduced to a secondary role in the Quest. Uniquely, Malory described the Grail as invisible, apparently confused by his French source text&#x27;s mention of an invisible Grail bearer.

===Scholarly hypotheses===
Scholars have long speculated on the origins of the Holy Grail before Chrétien, suggesting that it may contain elements of the trope of magical cauldrons from Celtic mythology and later Welsh mythology, combined with Christian legend surrounding the Eucharist, the latter found in Eastern Christian sources, conceivably in that of the Byzantine Mass, or even Persian sources. The view that the &quot;origin&quot; of the Grail legend should be seen as deriving from Celtic mythology was championed by Roger Sherman Loomis (&quot;The Grail: From Celtic Myth to Christian Symbol&quot;), Alfred Nutt (&quot;Studies on the Legend of the Holy Grail&quot;, available at Wikisource), and Jessie Weston (&quot;From Ritual to Romance&quot; and &quot;The Quest of the Holy Grail&quot;). Loomis traced a number of parallels between medieval Welsh literature and Irish material, and the Grail romances, including similarities between the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;″s Bran the Blessed and the Arthurian Fisher King, and between Bran&#x27;s life-restoring cauldron and the Grail.

The opposing view dismissed the &quot;Celtic&quot; connections as spurious, and interpreted the legend as essentially Christian in origin. Joseph Goering identified sources for Grail imagery in 12th-century wall paintings from churches in the Catalan Pyrenees (now mostly moved to the Museu Nacional d&#x27;Art de Catalunya), which present unique iconic images of the Virgin Mary holding a bowl that radiates tongues of fire, images that predate the first literary account by Chrétien de Troyes. Goering argues that they were the original inspiration for the Grail legend.

Psychologists Emma Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz used analytical psychology to interpret the Grail as a series of symbols in their book &quot;The Grail Legend&quot;. They directly expanded on interpretations by Carl Jung, which were later invoked by Joseph Campbell. Philosopher Henry Corbin, a member of the Eranos circle founded by Jung, also commented on the esoteric significance of the grail, relating it to the Iranian Islamic symbols that he studied.

Richard Barber (2004) argued that the Grail legend is connected to the introduction of &quot;more ceremony and mysticism&quot; surrounding the sacrament of the Eucharist in the high medieval period, proposing that the first Grail stories may have been connected to the &quot;renewal in this traditional sacrament&quot;. Daniel Scavone (1999, 2003) has argued that the &quot;Grail&quot; originally referred to the Image of Edessa. Goulven Peron (2016) suggested that the Holy Grail may reflect the horn of the river-god Achelous, as described by Ovid in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

==Later traditions==
===Relics===


In the wake of the Arthurian romances, several artifacts came to be identified as the Holy Grail in medieval relic veneration. These artifacts are said to have been the vessel used at the Last Supper, but other details vary. Despite the prominence of the Grail literature, traditions about a Last Supper relic remained rare in contrast to other items associated with Jesus&#x27; last days, such as the True Cross and Holy Lance.

One tradition predates the Grail romances: in the 7th century, the pilgrim Arculf reported that the Last Supper chalice was displayed near Jerusalem. In the wake of Robert de Boron&#x27;s Grail works, several other items came to be claimed as the true Last Supper vessel. In the late 12th century, one was said to be in Byzantium; Albrecht von Scharfenberg&#x27;s Grail romance &quot;Der Jüngere Titurel&quot; associated it explicitly with the Arthurian Grail, but claimed it was only a copy. This item was said to have been looted in the Fourth Crusade and brought to Troyes in France, but it was lost during the French Revolution.

Two relics associated with the Grail survive today. The &quot;Sacro Catino&quot; (Sacred Basin, also known as the Genoa Chalice) is a green glass dish held at the Genoa Cathedral said to have been used at the Last Supper. Its provenance is unknown, and there are two divergent accounts of how it was brought to Genoa by Crusaders in the 12th century. It was not associated with the Last Supper until later, in the wake of the Grail romances; the first known association is in Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s chronicle of Genoa in the late 13th century, which draws on the Grail literary tradition. The Catino was moved and broken during Napoleon&#x27;s conquest in the early 19th century, revealing that it is glass rather than emerald.

The Holy Chalice of Valencia is an agate dish with a mounting for use as a chalice. The bowl may date to Greco-Roman times, but its dating is unclear, and its provenance is unknown before 1399, when it was gifted to Martin I of Aragon. By the 14th century, an elaborate tradition had developed that this object was the Last Supper chalice. This tradition mirrors aspects of the Grail material, with several major differences, suggesting a separate tradition entirely. It is not associated with Joseph of Arimathea or Jesus&#x27; blood; it is said to have been taken to Rome by Saint Peter and later entrusted to Saint Lawrence. Early references do not call the object the &quot;Grail&quot;; the first evidence connecting it to the Grail tradition is from the 15th century. The monarchy sold the cup in the 15th century to Valencia Cathedral, where it remains a significant local icon.

Several objects were identified with the Holy Grail in the 17th century. In the 20th century, a series of new items became associated with it. These include the Nanteos Cup, a medieval wooden bowl found near Rhydyfelin, Wales; a glass dish found near Glastonbury, England; the Antioch chalice, a 6th-century silver-gilt object that became attached to the Grail legend in the 1930s; and the Chalice of Doña Urraca, a cup made between 200 BC and 100 AD, kept in León’s Basilica of Saint Isidore.

===Locations associated with the Holy Grail===
In the modern era, a number of places have become associated with the Holy Grail. One of the most prominent is Glastonbury in Somerset, England. Glastonbury was associated with King Arthur and his resting place of Avalon by the 12th century. In the 13th century, a legend arose that Joseph of Arimathea was the founder of Glastonbury Abbey. Early accounts of Joseph at Glastonbury focus on his role as the evangelist of Britain rather than as the custodian of the Holy Grail, but from the 15th century, the Grail became a more prominent part of the legends surrounding Glastonbury. Interest in Glastonbury resurged in the late 19th century, inspired by renewed interest in the Arthurian legend and contemporary spiritual movements centered on ancient sacred sites. In the late 19th century, John Goodchild hid a glass bowl near Glastonbury; a group of his friends, including Wellesley Tudor Pole, retrieved the cup in 1906 and promoted it as the original Holy Grail. Glastonbury and its Holy Grail legend have since become a point of focus for various New Age and Neopagan groups.

Some, not least the Benedictine monks, have identified the castle from &quot;Parzival&quot; with their real sanctuary of Montserrat in Catalonia. In the early 20th century, esoteric writers identified Montségur, a stronghold of the heretical Cathar sect in the 13th century, as the Grail castle. Similarly, the 14th-century Rosslyn Chapel in Midlothian, Scotland, became attached to the Grail legend in the mid-20th century when a succession of conspiracy books identified it as a secret hiding place of the Grail.

==Modern interpretations==
===Pseudohistory and conspiracy theories===
Since the 19th century, the Holy Grail has been linked to various conspiracy theories. In 1818, Austrian pseudohistorical writer Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall connected the Grail to contemporary myths surrounding the Knights Templar that cast the order as a secret society dedicated to mystical knowledge and relics. In Hammer-Purgstall&#x27;s work, the Grail is not a physical relic, but a symbol of the secret knowledge that the Templars sought. There is no historical evidence linking the Templars to a search for the Grail, but subsequent writers have elaborated on the Templar theories.

Starting in the early 20th century, writers, particularly in France, further connected the Templars and Grail to the Cathars. In 1906, French esoteric writer Joséphin Péladan identified the Cathar castle of Montségur with Munsalväsche or Montsalvat, the Grail castle in Wolfram&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot;. This identification has inspired a wider legend asserting that the Cathars possessed the Holy Grail. According to these stories, the Cathars guarded the Grail at Montségur, and smuggled it out when the castle fell in 1244.

Beginning in 1933, German writer Otto Rahn published a series of books tying the Grail, Templars, and Cathars to modern German nationalist mythology. According to Rahn, the Grail was a symbol of a pure Germanic religion repressed by Christianity. Rahn&#x27;s books inspired interest in the Grail within Nazi occultist circles, and led to the SS chief Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s abortive sponsorship of Rahn&#x27;s search for the Grail, as well as many subsequent conspiracy theories and fictional works about the Nazis searching for the Grail.

In the late 20th century, writers Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln created one of the most widely known conspiracy theories about the Holy Grail. The theory first appeared on the BBC documentary series &quot;Chronicle&quot; in the 1970s, and was elaborated upon in the bestselling 1982 book &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot;. The theory combines myths about the Templars and Cathars with various other legends, and a prominent hoax about a secret order called the Priory of Sion. According to this theory, the Holy Grail is not a physical object, but a symbol of the bloodline of Jesus. The blood connection is based on the etymological reading of &quot;san greal&quot; (holy grail) as &quot;sang real&quot; (royal blood), which dates to the 15th century. The narrative developed is that Jesus was not divine, and had children with Mary Magdalene, who took the family to France where their descendants became the Merovingian dynasty. Supposedly, while the Catholic Church worked to destroy the dynasty, they were protected by the Priory of Sion and their associates, including the Templars, Cathars, and other secret societies. The book, its arguments, and its evidence have been widely dismissed by scholars as pseudohistorical, but it has had a vast influence on conspiracy and alternate history books. It has also inspired fiction, most notably Dan Brown&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and its 2006 film adaptation.

===Music and painting===
The combination of hushed reverence, chromatic harmonies and sexualized imagery in Richard Wagner&#x27;s final music drama &quot;Parsifal&quot;, premiered in 1882, developed this theme, associating the Grail – now periodically producing blood – directly with female fertility. The high seriousness of the subject was also epitomized in Dante Gabriel Rossetti&#x27;s painting in which a woman modeled by Alexa Wilding holds the Grail with one hand, while adopting a gesture of blessing with the other.

A major mural series depicting the Quest for the Holy Grail was done by the artist Edwin Austin Abbey during the first decade of the 20th century for the Boston Public Library. Other artists, including George Frederic Watts and William Dyce, also portrayed grail subjects.

===Literature===
The story of the Grail and of the quest to find it became increasingly popular in the 19th century, referred to in literature such as Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s Arthurian cycle &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;. A sexualised interpretation of the grail, now identified with female genitalia, appeared in 1870 in Hargrave Jennings&#x27; book &quot;The Rosicrucians, Their Rites and Mysteries&quot;.

* T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922) loosely follows the legend of the Holy Grail and the Fisher King combined with vignettes of contemporary British society. In his first note to the poem, Eliot attributes the title to Jessie Weston&#x27;s book on the Grail legend, &quot;From Ritual to Romance&quot;. The allusion is to the wounding of the Fisher King and the subsequent sterility of his lands. A poem of the same title, though otherwise dissimilar, written by Madison Cawein, was published in 1913 in &quot;Poetry&quot;.
* In John Cowper Powys&#x27;s &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; (1932), the &quot;heroine is the Grail,&quot; and its central concerns are with the various myths and legends, along with the history associated with Glastonbury. It is also possible to see most of the main characters as undertaking a Grail quest.
* The Grail is central in Charles Williams&#x27; novel &quot;War in Heaven&quot; (1930) and his two collections of poems about Taliessin, &quot;Taliessin Through Logres&quot; and &quot;Region of the Summer Stars&quot; (1938).
*&quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; (1952) is a non-Arthurian historical Grail novel by Thomas B. Costain.
* A quest for the Grail appears in Nelson DeMille&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;The Quest&quot; (1975), set during the 1970s.
* Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s Arthurian revisionist fantasy novel &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; (1983) presented the Grail as a symbol of water, part of a set of objects representing the four classical elements. 
* The main theme of Rosalind Miles&#x27; &quot;Child of the Holy Grail&quot; (2000) in her &quot;Guenevere&quot; series is the story of the Grail quest by the 14-year-old Galahad.
* The Grail motif features heavily in Umberto Eco&#x27;s 2000 novel &quot;Baudolino&quot;, set in the 12th century.
* It is the subject of Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s historical fiction series of books &quot;The Grail Quest&quot; (2000–2012), set during the Hundred Years War. In his earlier series &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot;, an adaptation of the Arthurian legend, Cornwell also reimagines the Grail quest as a quest for a cauldron that is one of the Thirteen Treasures of Britain from Celtic mythology.
* Influenced by the 1982 publication of the ostensibly non-fiction &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;, Dan Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2003) has the &quot;grail&quot; taken to refer to Mary Magdalene as the &quot;receptacle&quot; of Jesus&#x27; bloodline (playing on the &quot;sang real&quot; etymology). In Brown&#x27;s novel, it is hinted that this Grail was long buried beneath Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, but that in recent decades, its guardians had it moved to a secret chamber embedded in the floor beneath the Inverted Pyramid in the entrance of the Louvre museum.
* Michael Moorcock&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The War Hound and the World&#x27;s Pain&quot; (1981) depicts a supernatural Grail quest set in the era of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.
*German history and fantasy novel author Rainer M. Schröder wrote the trilogy &quot;Die Bruderschaft vom Heiligen Gral&quot; (&quot;The Brotherhood of the Holy Grail&quot;) about a group of four Knights Templar who save the Grail from the Fall of Acre in 1291 and go through an odyssey to bring it to the Temple in Paris in the first two books, &quot;Der Fall von Akkon&quot; (2006) and &quot;Das Amulett der Wüstenkrieger&quot; (2006), while defending the holy relic from the attempts of a Satanic sect called Iscarians to steal it. In the third book, &quot;Das Labyrinth der schwarzen Abtei&quot; (2007), the four heroes must reunite to smuggle the Holy Grail out of the Temple in Paris after the trials of the Knights Templar in 1307, again pursued by the Iscarians. Schröder indirectly addresses the Cathar theory by letting the four heroes encounter Cathars – among them old friends from their flight from Acre – on their way to Portugal to seek refuge with the King of Portugal and travel further west.
* The 15th novel in &quot;The Dresden Files&quot; series by Jim Butcher, &quot;Skin Game&quot; (2014), features Harry Dresden being recruited by Denarian and longtime enemy Nicodemus into a heist team seeking to retrieve the Holy Grail from the vault of Hades, the lord of the Underworld. The properties of the item are not explicit, but the relic itself makes an appearance and is in the hands of Nicodemus by the end of the novel&#x27;s events.
* The Holy Grail features prominently in Jack Vance&#x27;s &quot;Lyonesse Trilogy&quot;, where it is the subject of an earlier quest, several generations before the birth of King Arthur. However, in contrast to the Arthurian canon, Vance&#x27;s Grail is a common object lacking any magical or spiritual qualities, and the characters finding it derive little benefit.
* &quot;Grails: Quests of the Dawn&quot; (1994), edited by Richard Gilliam, Martin H. Greenberg, and Edward E. Kramer is a collection of 25 short stories about the grail by various science fiction and fantasy writers.
* In Robert Bruton&#x27;s &quot;Empire in Apocalypse&quot; (2023), the Holy Grail appears as General Belisarius&#x27;s Vandal chalice, recovered with other treasures the Vandals had stolen during the sacking of Rome.

===Film and other media===
In the cinema, the Holy Grail debuted in the 1904 silent film &quot;Parsifal&quot;, an adaptation of Wagner&#x27;s opera by Edwin S. Porter. More recent cinematic adaptations include Costain&#x27;s &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; made into a 1954 film by Victor Saville and Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; turned into a 2006 film by Ron Howard.

* The silent drama film &quot;The Light in the Dark&quot; (1922) involves discovery of the Grail in modern times.
* Robert Bresson&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;Lancelot du Lac&quot; (1974) includes a more realistic version of the Grail quest from Arthurian romances.
* &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975) is a comedic take on the Arthurian Grail quest, adapted in 2004 as the stage production &quot;Spamalot&quot;. 
* John Boorman, in his fantasy film &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981), attempted to restore a more traditional heroic representation of an Arthurian tale, in which the Grail is revealed as a mystical means to revitalise Arthur and the barren land to which his depressive sickness is connected.
* Steven Spielberg&#x27;s adventure film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989) features Indiana Jones and his father in a race for the Grail against the Nazis.
* In a pair of fifth-season episodes (September 1989), entitled &quot;Legend of the Holy Rose,&quot; MacGyver undertakes a quest for the Grail.
* Terry Gilliam&#x27;s comedy-drama film &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991) features the Grail quest in the modern New York City.
* In the season one episode &quot;Grail&quot; (1994) of the television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, a man named Aldous Gajic visits Babylon 5 in his continuing quest to find the Holy Grail. His quest is primarily a plot device, as the episode&#x27;s action revolves not around the quest but rather around his presence and impact on the life of a station resident.
* The video game &quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot; (1999) features an alternate version of the Grail, interwoven with the mythology of the Knights Templar. The Holy Grail is revealed in the story to be the blood of Jesus Christ that contains his power, only accessible to those descended from him, with the vessel of the Grail being defined as his body itself which the Templars uncovered in the Holy Lands.
* In &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon,&quot; the Holy Grail (Sehai in the anime, or Rainbow Moon Chalice) is the magical object with which Sailor Moon transforms in her Super form.
* A science fiction version of the Grail Quest is central theme in the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; season 10 episode &quot;The Quest&quot; (2006).
* The song &quot;Holy Grail&quot; by Jay-Z featuring Justin Timberlake was released in 2013.
* In the video game &quot;Persona 5&quot; (2016), the Holy Grail is the Treasure of the game&#x27;s final Palace, representing the combined desires of all of humanity for a higher power to take control of their lives and make a world that has no sense of individuality.
* In the television series &quot;Knightfall&quot; (2017), the search for the Holy Grail by the Knights Templar is a major theme of the series&#x27; first season. The Grail, which appears as a simple earthenware cup, is coveted by various factions including the Pope, who thinks that possession of it will enable him to ignite another Crusade.
* In the &quot;Fate&quot; franchise, the Holy Grail serves as the prize of the Holy Grail War, granting a single wish to the victor of the battle royale. However, it is hinted at throughout the series that this Grail is not the real chalice of Christ, but is actually an item of uncertain nature created by mages some generations ago.
* In the &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; video game franchise the Holy Grail is mentioned. In the original game, one Templar refers to the main relic of the game as the Holy Grail, although it was later discovered to be one of many Apples of Eden. The Holy Grail was mentioned again in Templar Legends, ending up in either Scotland or Spain by different accounts. The Holy Grail appears again in &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Altaïr&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;, by the name of the Chalice, however this time not as an object but as a woman named Adha, similar to the sang rael, or royal blood, interpretation.
* In the fourth series of &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;, the trio goes to Nosy Boraha where they accidentally find the Holy Grail while searching for La Buse&#x27;s buried treasure.
* In the 17th episode of &quot;Little Witch Academia&quot;, &quot;Amanda O&#x27;Neill and the Holy Grail&quot;, the Holy Grail is used as a plot device in which witches Amanda O&#x27;Neill and Akko Kagari set out to find the item itself at Appleton School.
* In the 12th episode of season 9 of the American show &quot;The Office&quot;, Jim Halpert sends Dwight Schrute on a wild goose chase to find the Holy Grail. After Dwight completing all the clues to find it, but coming up empty handed, the camera cuts to Glenn drinking out of it in his office.
* In the 2022 Christmas special episode of the British TV series &quot;Detectorists&quot;, &quot;Special&quot;, Lance finds a crockery cup, eyes only, in a field that turns out to be where a historic battle took place and a reliquary containing the Holy Grail was lost. A montage shows how the same crockery cup went from the hands of Jesus at the Last Supper (implied) to being lost in the field.
* The 2023 limited television series &quot;Mrs. Davis&quot; revolves around Sister Simone&#x27;s quest to find and destroy the Holy Grail, both as the central plot device and also as metacommentary on quests for the Holy Grail, which one character observes might be the &quot;most overused MacGuffin ever&quot;.

<text>Hunt the Wumpus is a text-based adventure game developed by Gregory Yob in 1973. In the game, the player moves through a series of connected caves, arranged as the vertices of a dodecahedron, as they hunt a monster named the Wumpus. The turn-based game has the player trying to avoid fatal bottomless pits and &quot;super bats&quot; that will move them around the cave system; the goal is to fire one of their &quot;crooked arrows&quot; through the caves to kill the Wumpus. Yob created the game in early 1973 due to his annoyance at the multiple hide-and-seek games set in caves in a grid pattern, and multiple variations of the game were sold via mail order by Yob and the People&#x27;s Computer Company. The source code to the game was published in &quot;Creative Computing&quot; in 1975 and republished in &quot;The Best of Creative Computing&quot; the following year.

The game sparked multiple variations and expanded versions and was ported to several systems, including the TI-99/4A home computer. It has been cited as an early example of the survival horror genre, and was listed in 2012 on &quot;Time&quot;″s All-Time 100 greatest video games list. The Wumpus monster has appeared in several forms in media since 1973, including other video games, a novella, and &quot;&quot; cards.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot; is a text-based adventure game set in a series of caves connected by tunnels. In one of the twenty caves is a &quot;Wumpus&quot;, which the player is attempting to kill. Additionally, two of the caves contain bottomless pits, while two others contain &quot;super bats&quot; which will pick up the player and move them to a random cave. The game is turn-based; each cave is given a number by the game, and each turn begins with the player being told which cave they are in and which caves are connected to it by tunnels. The player then elects to either move to one of those connected caves or shoot one of their five &quot;crooked arrows&quot;, named for their ability to change direction while in flight. Each cave is connected to three others, and the system as a whole is equivalent to a dodecahedron.

The caves are in complete darkness, so the player cannot see into adjacent caves; instead, upon moving to a new empty cave, the game describes if they can smell a Wumpus, hear a bat, or feel a draft from a pit in one of the connected caves. Entering a cave with a pit ends the game due to the player falling in, while entering the cave with the Wumpus startles it; the Wumpus will either move to another cave or remain and kill the player. If the player chooses to fire an arrow, they first select how many caves, up to five, that the arrow will travel through, and then enters each cave that the arrow moves through. If the player enters a cave number that is not connected to where the arrow is, the game picks a valid option at random. If the arrow hits the player while it is travelling, the player loses; if it hits the Wumpus, they win. If the arrow does not hit anything, then the Wumpus is startled and may move to a new cave; unlike the player, the Wumpus is not affected by super bats or pits. If the Wumpus moves to the player&#x27;s location, they lose.

==Development==

In early 1973, Gregory Yob was looking through some of the games published by the People&#x27;s Computer Company (PCC), and grew annoyed that there were multiple games, including &quot;Hurkle&quot; and &quot;Mugwump&quot;, that had the player &quot;hide and seek&quot; in a 10 by 10 grid. Yob was inspired to make a game that used a non-grid pattern, where the player would move through points connected through some other type of topology. Yob came up with the name &quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot; that afternoon, and decided from there that the player would traverse through rooms arranged in a non-grid pattern, with a monster called a Wumpus somewhere in them.

Yob chose a dodecahedron because it was his favorite platonic solid, and because he had once made a kite shaped like one. From there, Yob added the arrows to shoot between rooms, terming it the &quot;crooked arrow&quot; as it would need to change directions to go through multiple caves, and decided that the player could only sense nearby caves by smell, as a light would wake the Wumpus up. He then added the bottomless pits, and a couple days later the super bats. Finally, feeling that players would want to create a map, he made the cave map fixed and gave each cave a number. Yob later claimed that, to his knowledge, most players did not create maps of the cave system, nor follow his expected strategy of carefully moving around the system to determine exactly where the Wumpus was before firing an arrow. While playtesting the game, Yob found it unexciting that the Wumpus always stayed in one place, and so changed it to be able to move. He then delivered a copy of the game, written in BASIC, to the PCC.

In May 1973, one month after he had finished coding the game, Yob went to a conference at Stanford University and discovered that in the section of the conference where the PCC had set up computer terminals, multiple players were engrossed in playing &quot;Wumpus&quot;, making it, in his opinion, a hit game. The PCC first mentioned the game in its newsletter in September as a &quot;cave game&quot; that would be available to order through them soon, and gave it a full two-page description in its next issue in November of the same year. Tapes containing &quot;Wumpus&quot; were sold via mail order by both the PCC and Yob himself. The PCC description was republished along with source code in its book &quot;What to Do After You Hit Return&quot; in 1977, while a description of the game and its source code was published in &quot;Creative Computing&quot; in its October 1975 issue, and republished in &quot;The Best of Creative Computing&quot; the following year. It also appeared in other books of BASIC games, such as &quot;Computer Programs in BASIC&quot; in 1981.

==Legacy==
Multiple versions of &quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot; were created and distributed after the game&#x27;s release. Yob made &quot;Wumpus 2&quot; and &quot;Wumpus 3&quot;, beginning immediately after finishing the original game, with &quot;Wumpus 2&quot; adding different cave arrangements and &quot;Wumpus 3&quot; adding more hazards. The source code for &quot;Wumpus 2&quot; was published in &quot;Creative Computing&quot; and republished in &quot;The Best of Creative Computing 2&quot; (1977), along with a description of &quot;Wumpus 3&quot;. The PCC announced in the same November 1973 newsletter issue as it discussed the original game that a version from them titled &quot;Super Wumpus&quot; would be available soon, and listed it in its order catalog in its January 1974 issue under both that name and &quot;Wumpus 3&quot;. In 1978, a book titled &quot;Superwumpus&quot;, by Jack Emmerichs, was published containing source code for both BASIC and assembly language versions of his unrelated version of &quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot;.

In addition to the original BASIC games, versions of &quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot; have been created for numerous other systems. Yob had seen or heard of versions in several languages, such as IBM RPG and Fortran, by 1975. A version in C, written in November 1973 by Ken Thompson, creator of the Unix operating system, was released in 1974; a later C version can still be found in the bsdgames package on modern BSD and Linux operating systems. In 1978, Danny Hillis, working as a summer intern on the TMS9918 graphics chip, wrote a graphical version of the game as a demonstration with the pattern of caves displayed as a torus instead of a dodecahedron, which was later published as a commercial game for the TI-99/4A. In 1981, a version was released for the HP-41C calculator. 

&quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot; has been cited as an early example of a survival horror game; the book &quot;Vampires and Zombies&quot; claims that it was an early example of the genre, while the paper &quot;Restless dreams in Silent Hill&quot; states that &quot;from a historical perspective the genre&#x27;s roots lie in &quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot;&quot;. Other sources, however, such as the book &quot;The World of Scary Video Games&quot;, claim that the game lacks elements needed for a &quot;horror&quot; game, as the player hunts rather than is hunted by the Wumpus, and nothing in the game is explicitly intended to frighten the player, making it more of an early adventure or puzzle game. Kevin Cogger of 1Up.com claimed that &quot;Wumpus&quot;, whether or not it is an adventure game, &quot;introduced a number of concepts that would come to define the adventure genre&quot;, such as presenting the game from the perspective of the player-character, and non-grid-based map design. In 2012, &quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot; was listed on &quot;Time&quot;″s All-Time 100 greatest video games list.

The Wumpus monster has appeared in several different forms of media, such as several &quot;Wumpus&quot; creature cards in &quot;&quot; including a &quot;Hunted Wumpus&quot;, video games such as &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; (1983), and Cory Doctorow&#x27;s 2011 novella &quot;The Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot;. The textbook &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot;, with editions published since 1995, uses a version of this game as one of the examples. An interactive audio-only version of the game was displayed by Jared Bendis as &quot;Treasure of the Wumpus in the Azimuth Cave&quot; at festivals in Ohio from 2011 to 2018, and an interactive touch screen version of the game, &quot;Return to Wumpus Cave&quot;, was presented in 2022.

<text>Hearst Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiary Hearst Holdings Inc., and HHI&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary Hearst Communications Inc. comprise a constitutional American multinational mass media and business information conglomerate owned by the Hearst family and based in Hearst Tower in Midtown Manhattan in New York City.

Hearst owns newspapers, magazines, television channels, and television stations, including the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot;. It owns 50% of the A&amp;E Networks cable network group and 20% of the Walt Disney Company’s sports division ESPN Inc..

The conglomerate also owns several business-information companies, including Fitch Group and First Databank. The company was founded by William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper owner most well known for use of yellow journalism. The Hearst family remains involved in its ownership and management.

== History ==
=== Formative years ===
In 1880, George Hearst, mining entrepreneur and U.S. senator, bought the &quot;San Francisco Daily Examiner.&quot; In 1887, he turned the &quot;Examiner&quot; over to his son, William Randolph Hearst, who that year founded the Hearst Corporation. The younger Hearst eventually built readership for Hearst-owned newspapers and magazines from 15,000 to over 20 million. Hearst began to purchase and launched other newspapers, including the &quot;New York Journal&quot; in 1895 and the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; in 1903.

In 1903, Hearst created &quot;Motor&quot; magazine, the first title in his company&#x27;s magazine division. He acquired &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in 1905, and &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; in 1911. The company entered the book publishing business in 1913 with the formation of Hearst&#x27;s International Library. Hearst began producing film features in the mid-1910s, creating one of the earliest animation studios: the International Film Service, turning characters from Hearst newspaper strips into film characters.

Hearst bought the &quot;Atlanta Georgian&quot; in 1912, the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; and the &quot;San Francisco Post&quot; in 1913, the &quot;Boston Advertiser&quot; and the &quot;Washington Times&quot; (unrelated to the present-day paper) in 1917, and the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot; in 1918 (resulting in the &quot;Herald-Examiner&quot;).

In 1919, Hearst&#x27;s book publishing division was renamed Cosmopolitan Book.

=== Peak era ===

In the 1920s and 1930s, Hearst owned the biggest media conglomerate in the world, which included a number of magazines and newspapers in major cities. Hearst also began acquiring radio stations to complement his papers. Hearst saw financial challenges in the early 1920s, when he was using company funds to build Hearst Castle in San Simeon and support movie production at Cosmopolitan Productions. This eventually led to the merger of the magazine &quot;Hearst International&quot; with &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in 1925.

Despite some financial troubles, Hearst began extending its reach in 1921, purchasing the &quot;Detroit Times&quot;, &quot;The Boston Record,&quot; and the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer.&quot; Hearst then added the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot; and &quot;Washington Herald,&quot; as well as the &quot;Oakland Post-Enquirer&quot;, the &quot;Syracuse Telegram&quot; and the &quot;Rochester Journal-American&quot; in 1922. He continued his buying spree into the mid-1920s, purchasing the &quot;Baltimore News&quot; (1923), the &quot;San Antonio Light&quot; (1924), the &quot;Albany Times Union&quot; (1924), and &quot;The Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; (1924). In 1924, Hearst entered the tabloid market in New York City with &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot;, meant to compete with the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

In addition to print and radio, Hearst established Cosmopolitan Pictures in the early 1920s, distributing his films under the newly created Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In 1929, Hearst and MGM created the Hearst Metrotone newsreels.

=== Retrenching after the Great Depression ===
The Great Depression hurt Hearst and his publications. Cosmopolitan Book was sold to Farrar &amp; Rinehart in 1931. After two years of leasing them to Eleanor &quot;Cissy&quot; Patterson (of the McCormick-Patterson family that owned the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;), Hearst sold her &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and &quot;Herald&quot; in 1939; she merged them to form the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot;. That year he also bought the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; from Paul Block (who bought it from the Pfisters in 1929), absorbing his afternoon &quot;Wisconsin News&quot; into the morning publication. Also in 1939, he sold the &quot;Atlanta Georgian&quot; to Cox Newspapers, which merged it with the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot;.

Following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in Germany, the Nazis received positive press coverage by Hearst presses and paid ten times the standard subscription rate for the INS wire service belonging to Hearst. William Randolph Hearst personally instructed his reporters in Germany to only give positive coverage to Hitler and the Nazis, and fired journalists who refused to write stories favourable of German fascism. During this time, high ranking Nazis were given space to write articles in Hearst press newspapers, including Hermann Göring and Alfred Rosenberg.

Hearst, with his chain now owned by his creditors after a 1937 liquidation, also had to merge some of his morning papers into his afternoon papers. In Chicago, he combined the morning &quot;Herald-Examiner&quot; and the afternoon &quot;American&quot; into the &quot;Herald-American&quot; in 1939. This followed the 1937 combination of the New York &quot;Evening Journal&quot; and the morning &quot;American&quot; into the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;, the sale of the &quot;Omaha Daily Bee&quot; to the &quot;World-Herald&quot;.

Afternoon papers were a profitable business in pre-television days, often outselling their morning counterparts featuring stock market information in early editions, while later editions were heavy on sporting news with results of baseball games and horse races. Afternoon papers also benefited from continuous reports from the battlefront during World War II. After the war, however, both television news and suburbs experienced explosive growth; thus, evening papers were more affected than those published in the morning, whose circulation remained stable while their afternoon counterparts&#x27; sales plummeted.

In 1947, Hearst produced an early television newscast for the DuMont Television Network: &quot;I.N.S. Telenews&quot;, and in 1948 he became the owner of one of the first television stations in the country, WBAL-TV in Baltimore.

The earnings of Hearst&#x27;s three morning papers, the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot;, and &quot;The Milwaukee Sentinel&quot;, supported the company&#x27;s money-losing afternoon publications such as the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot;, the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;, and the &quot;Chicago American&quot;. The company sold the latter paper in 1956 to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s o wners, who changed it to the tabloid-size &quot;Chicago Today&quot; in 1969 and ceased publication in 1974. In 1960, Hearst also sold the &quot;Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph&quot; to the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Detroit Times&quot; to &quot;The Detroit News&quot;. After a lengthy strike it sold the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; to the afternoon &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; in 1962. The same year Hearst&#x27;s Los Angeles papers – the morning &quot;Examiner&quot; and the afternoon &quot;Herald-Express&quot; – merged to become the evening &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot;. The 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike left the city with no papers for over three months, with the &quot;Journal-American&quot; one of the earliest strike targets of the Typographical Union. The &quot;Boston Record&quot; and the &quot;Evening American&quot; merged in 1961 as the &quot;Record-American&quot; and in 1964, the &quot;Baltimore News-Post&quot; became the &quot;Baltimore News-American&quot;.

In 1953, Hearst Magazines bought &quot;Sports Afield&quot; magazine, which it published until 1999 when it sold the journal to Robert E. Petersen. In 1958, Hearst&#x27;s International News Service merged with E.W. Scripps&#x27; United Press, forming United Press International as a response to the growth of the Associated Press and Reuters. The following year Scripps-Howard&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco News&quot; merged with Hearst&#x27;s afternoon &quot;San Francisco Call-Bulletin&quot;. Also in 1959, Hearst acquired the paperback book publisher Avon Books.

In 1965, the Hearst Corporation began pursuing joint operating agreements (JOAs). It reached the first agreement with the DeYoung family, proprietors of the afternoon &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, which began to produce a joint Sunday edition with the &quot;Examiner&quot;. In turn, the &quot;Examiner&quot; became an evening publication, absorbing the &quot;News-Call-Bulletin&quot;. The following year, the &quot;Journal-American&quot; reached another JOA with another two landmark New York City papers: the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and Scripps-Howard&#x27;s &quot;World-Telegram and Sun&quot; to form the &quot;New York World Journal Tribune&quot; (recalling the names of the city&#x27;s mid-market dailies), which collapsed after only a few months.

The 1962 merger of the &quot;Herald-Express&quot; and &quot;Examiner&quot; in Los Angeles led to the termination of many journalists who began to stage a 10-year strike in 1967. The effects of the strike accelerated the pace of the company&#x27;s demise, with the &quot;Herald Examiner&quot; ceasing publication November 2, 1989.

=== Newspaper shifts ===
Hearst moved into hardcover publishing by acquiring Arbor House in 1978 and William Morrow and Company in 1981.

In 1982, the company sold the &quot;Boston Herald American&quot; — the result of the 1972 merger of Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Record-American &amp; Advertiser&quot; with the &quot;Herald-Traveler&quot; — to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, which renamed the paper as &quot;The Boston Herald&quot;, competing to this day with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

In 1986, Hearst bought the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; and that same year closed the 213-year-old &quot;Baltimore News-American&quot; after a failed attempt to reach a JOA with A.S. Abell Company, the family who published &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; since its founding in 1837. Abell sold the paper several days later to the Times-Mirror syndicate of the Chandlers&#x27; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, also competitor to the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot;, which folded in 1989. In 1990, both King Features Entertainment and King Phoenix Entertainment were rebranded under the collective Hearst Entertainment umbrella. King Features Entertainment was renamed to Hearst Entertainment Distribution, while King Phoenix Entertainment was renamed to Hearst Entertainment Productions.

In 1993, Hearst closed the &quot;San Antonio Light&quot; after it purchased the rival &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; from Murdoch.

On November 8, 1990, Hearst Corporation acquired 20% stake of ESPN, Inc. from RJR Nabisco (now a subsidiary of Mondelez International) for a price estimated between $165 million and $175 million. The other 80% has been owned by The Walt Disney Company since 1996. Over the last 25 years, the ESPN investment is said to have accounted for at least 50% of total Hearst Corp profits and is worth at least $13 billion.

On July 31, 1996, Hearst and the Cisneros Group of Companies of Venezuela announced its plans to launch Locomotion, a Latin American animation cable television channel.

On March 27, 1997, Hearst Broadcasting announced that it would merge with Argyle Television Holdings II for $525 million, the merger was completed in August to form Hearst-Argyle Television (later renamed as Hearst Television in 2009).

In 1999, Hearst sold its Avon and Morrow book publishing activities to HarperCollins.

In 2000, the Hearst Corp. sold its flagship and &quot;Monarch of the Dailies&quot;, the afternoon &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, and acquiring the long-time competing, but now larger morning paper, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; from the Charles de Young family. The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; is now published as a daily freesheet.

In December 2003, Marvel Entertainment acquired &quot;Cover Concepts&quot; from Hearst, to extend Marvel&#x27;s demographic reach among public school children.

In 2009, A&amp;E Networks acquired Lifetime Entertainment Services, with Hearst ownership increasing to 42%.

In 2010, Hearst acquired digital marketing agency iCrossing.

In 2011, Hearst absorbed more than 100 magazine titles from the Lagardère Group for more than $700 million and became a challenger of Time Inc ahead of Condé Nast. In December 2012, Hearst Corporation partnered again with NBCUniversal to launch Esquire Network.

On February 20, 2014, Hearst Magazines International appointed Gary Ellis to the new position, Chief Digital Officer. That December, DreamWorks Animation sold a 25% stake in AwesomenessTV for $81.25 million to Hearst.

In January 2017, Hearst announced that it had acquired a majority stake in Litton Entertainment. Its CEO, Dave Morgan, was a former employee of Hearst.

On January 23, 2017, Hearst announced that it had acquired the business operations of The Pioneer Group from fourth-generation family owners Jack and John Batdorff. The Pioneer Group was a Michigan-based communications network that circulates print and digital news to local communities across the state. In addition to daily newspapers, &quot;The Pioneer&quot; and &quot;Manistee News Advocate&quot;, Pioneer published three weekly papers and four local shopper publications, and operated a digital marketing services business. The acquisition brought Hearst Newspapers to publishing 19 daily and 61 weekly papers.

Other 2017 acquisitions include the &quot;New Haven Register&quot; and associated papers from Digital First Media, and the Alton, Illinois, &quot;Telegraph&quot; and Jacksonville, Illinois, &quot;Journal-Courier&quot; from Civitas Media.

In October 2017, Hearst announced it would acquire the magazine and book businesses of Rodale in Emmaus, Pennsylvania with some sources reporting the purchase price as about $225 million. The transaction was expected to close in January following government approvals.

In 2018, Hearst acquired the global health and wellness magazine brands owned by Rodale, Inc.

In April 2023, Hearst bought WBBH-TV, an NBC-affiliated television station in Fort Myers, Florida, from Waterman Broadcasting Corporation. In June 2023, Hearst acquired the &quot;Journal Inquirer&quot; and later in October 2023 bought &quot;San Antonio Magazine.&quot; The company paid $150,000 in cash plus an amount equal to 90% of the magazine&#x27;s accounts receivable 

In November 2023, Hearst acquired all print and digital operations owned by RJ Media Group, including the &quot;Record-Journal&quot;, seven weekly newspapers and a digital advertising agency. In December 2023, Hearst bought Puzzmo, a puzzle games website.

== Trustees of William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s will ==
Under William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s will, a common board of thirteen trustees (its composition fixed at five family members and eight outsiders) administers the Hearst Foundation, the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, and the trust that owns (and selects the 26-member board of) the Hearst Corporation (parent of Hearst Communications which shares the same officers). The foundations shared ownership until tax law changed to prevent this.

In 2009, it was estimated to be the largest private company managed by trustees in this way. As of 2017, the trustees are:

=== Family members ===
* Anissa Boudjakdji Balson, granddaughter of fifth son, David Whitmire Hearst Sr.
* Lisa Hearst Hagerman, granddaughter of third son, John Randolph Hearst Sr.
* George Randolph Hearst III, grandson of Hearst&#x27;s eldest son, George Randolph Hearst Sr., and publisher of the &quot;Albany Times Union&quot;
* William Randolph Hearst III, son of second son, William Randolph Hearst Jr., and chairman of the board of the corporation
* Virginia Hearst Randt, daughter of late former chairman and fourth son, Randolph Apperson Hearst

=== Non-family members ===
* James M. Asher, chief legal and development officer of the corporation
* David J. Barrett, former chief executive officer of Hearst Television, Inc.
* Frank A. Bennack Jr., former chief executive officer and executive vice chairman of the corporation
* John G. Conomikes, former executive of the corporation, preceded Barrett at Hearst-Argyle Television
* Gilbert C. Maurer, former chief operating officer of the corporation and former president of Hearst Magazines
* Mark F. Miller, former executive vice president of Hearst Magazines
* Mitchell Scherzer, executive vice president and chief financial officer of the corporation
* Steven R. Swartz, president and chief executive officer of the corporation

The trust dissolves when all family members alive at the time of Hearst&#x27;s death in August 1951 have died.

<doc id="14328" wikidata="Q219780" url="?curid=14328" title="Hunter S. Thompson">
<text>Hunter Stockton Thompson (July 18, 1937 – February 20, 2005) was an American journalist and author, regarded as one of the principal pioneers of New Journalism, along with Gay Talese, Truman Capote, Norman Mailer, Joan Didion, and Tom Wolfe. He rose to prominence with the publication of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1967), a book for which he spent a year living with the Hells Angels motorcycle club to write a first-hand account of their lives and experiences. In 1970, he wrote an unconventional article titled &quot;The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved&quot; for &quot;Scanlan&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, which further raised his profile as a countercultural figure. It also set him on the path to establishing his own subgenre of New Journalism that he called &quot;Gonzo&quot;, a journalistic style in which the writer becomes a central figure and participant in the events of the narrative.

Thompson remains best known for &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1972), a book first serialized in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in which he grapples with the implications of what he considered the failure of the 1960s counterculture movement. It was adapted for film twice: loosely in 1980 in &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot; and explicitly in 1998 in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;.

Thompson ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado in 1970 on the Freak Power ticket. He became known for his intense dislike of Richard Nixon, who he claimed represented &quot;that dark, venal, and incurably violent side of the American character&quot;. He covered George McGovern&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and later collected the stories in book form as &quot;Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail &#x27;72&quot; (1973).

Starting in the mid-1970s, Thompson&#x27;s output declined, as he struggled with the consequences of fame and substance abuse, and failed to complete several high-profile assignments for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. For much of the late 1980s and early 1990s, he worked as a columnist for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;. Most of his work from 1979 to 1994 was collected in &quot;The Gonzo Papers&quot;. He continued to write sporadically for various outlets, including &quot;Rolling Stone,&quot; &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Esquire,&quot; and ESPN.com until the end of his life.

Thompson was known for his lifelong use of alcohol and illegal drugs, his love of firearms, and his iconoclastic contempt for authority. He often remarked: &quot;I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they&#x27;ve always worked for me.&quot; Thompson died by suicide at the age of 67, following a series of health problems. Hari Kunzru wrote, &quot;The true voice of Thompson is revealed to be that of American moralist ... one who often makes himself ugly to expose the ugliness he sees around him.&quot;

==Early life==
Thompson was born into a middle-class family in Louisville, Kentucky, the first of three sons of Virginia Davison Ray (1908, Springfield, Kentucky – March 20, 1998, Louisville), who worked as head librarian at the Louisville Free Public Library and Jack Robert Thompson (September 4, 1893, Horse Cave, Kentucky – July 3, 1952, Louisville), a public insurance adjuster and World War I veteran. His parents were introduced by a friend from Jack&#x27;s fraternity at the University of Kentucky in September 1934, and married on November 2, 1935. Journalist Nicholas Lezard of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that Thompson&#x27;s first name, Hunter, came from an ancestor on his mother&#x27;s side, the Scottish surgeon John Hunter. A more direct attribution is that Thompson&#x27;s first and middle name, Hunter Stockton, came from his maternal grandparents, Prestly Stockton Ray and Lucille Hunter.

In December 1943, when Thompson was six years old, the family settled in the affluent Cherokee Triangle neighborhood of The Highlands. On July 3, 1952, when Thompson was 14, his father died of myasthenia gravis at age 58. Hunter and his brothers were raised by their mother. Virginia worked as a librarian to support her children and was described as a &quot;heavy drinker&quot; following her husband&#x27;s death.

===Education===

Interested in sports and athletically inclined from a young age, Thompson co-founded the Hawks Athletic Club while attending I.N. Bloom Elementary School, which led to an invitation to join Louisville&#x27;s Castlewood Athletic Club for adolescents that prepared them for high-school sports. Ultimately, he never joined a sports team in high school. He grew up in the same neighborhood as mystery novelist Sue Grafton, who was a few years behind him in school.

Thompson attended I.N. Bloom Elementary School, Highland Middle School, and Atherton High School, before transferring to Louisville Male High School in fall 1952. Also in 1952, he was accepted as a member of the Athenaeum Literary Association, a school-sponsored literary and social club that dated to 1862. Its members at the time came from Louisville&#x27;s upper-class families, and included Porter Bibb, who later became the first publisher of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; at Thompson&#x27;s behest. During this time, Thompson read and admired J. P. Donleavy&#x27;s &quot;The Ginger Man&quot;.

As an Athenaeum member, Thompson contributed articles to and helped produce the club&#x27;s yearbook &quot;The Spectator&quot; until the group ejected Thompson in 1955 for criminal activity. Charged as an accessory to robbery after being in a car with the perpetrator, Thompson was sentenced to 60 days in Kentucky&#x27;s Jefferson County Jail. He served 31 days and, during his incarceration, was refused permission to take final exams, preventing his graduation. He enlisted in the United States Air Force upon release.

===Military service===

Thompson completed basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas and transferred to Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, Illinois to study electronics. He applied to become an aviator, but the Air Force&#x27;s aviation-cadet program rejected his application. In 1956, he transferred to Eglin Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach, Florida. While serving at Eglin, he took evening classes at Florida State University. At Eglin, he landed his first professional writing job as sports editor of &quot;The Command Courier&quot; by lying about his job experience. As sports editor, Thompson traveled around the United States with the Eglin Eagles football team, covering its games. In early 1957, he wrote a sports column for &quot;The Playground News&quot;, a local newspaper in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. His name did not appear on the column because Air Force regulations forbade outside employment.

In 1958, while he was an airman first class, his commanding officer recommended him for an early honorable discharge. &quot;In summary, this airman, although talented, will not be guided by policy,&quot; chief of information services Colonel William S. Evans wrote to the Eglin personnel office. &quot;Sometimes his rebel and superior attitude seems to rub off on other airmen staff members.&quot;

===Early journalism career===
After leaving the Air Force, Thompson worked as sports editor for a newspaper in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania, before relocating to New York City. There he audited several courses at the Columbia University School of General Studies. During this time he worked briefly for &quot;Time&quot; as a copy boy for $51 a week. At work, he typed out parts of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; to learn the authors&#x27; rhythms and writing styles. In 1959, &quot;Time&quot; fired him for insubordination. Later that year, he worked as a reporter for &quot;The Middletown Daily Record&quot; in Middletown, New York. He was fired from this job after damaging an office candy machine and arguing with the owner of a local restaurant who happened to be an advertiser with the paper.

In 1960, Thompson moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to take a job with the sporting magazine &quot;El Sportivo&quot;, which ceased operations soon after his arrival. Thompson applied for a job with the Puerto Rican English-language daily &quot;The San Juan Star&quot;, but its managing editor, future novelist William J. Kennedy, turned him down. Nonetheless, the two became friends. After the demise of &quot;El Sportivo&quot;, Thompson worked as a stringer for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and a few other stateside papers on Caribbean issues, with Kennedy working as his editor.

After returning to mainland United States in 1961, Thompson visited San Francisco and eventually lived in Big Sur, where he spent eight months as security guard and caretaker at Slates Hot Springs, just before it became the Esalen Institute. At the time, Big Sur was a Beat outpost and home of Henry Miller and the screenwriter Dennis Murphy, both of whom Thompson admired. During this period, he published his first magazine feature in &quot;Rogue&quot; about the artisan and bohemian culture of Big Sur and worked on &quot;The Rum Diary&quot;. He managed to publish one short story, &quot;Burial at Sea,&quot; which also appeared in &quot;Rogue&quot;. It was his first piece of published fiction. &quot;The Rum Diary&quot;, based on Thompson&#x27;s experiences in Puerto Rico, was finally published in and in 2011 was adapted as a motion picture. Paul Perry notes that Thompson exhibited extreme homophobia while at Big Sur, making violent threats to expel gay bathers from local hot springs.

In May 1962, Thompson traveled to South America for a year as a correspondent for the Dow Jones-owned weekly paper, the &quot;National Observer&quot;. In Brazil, he spent several months as a reporter for the Rio de Janeiro-based &quot;Brazil Herald&quot;, the country&#x27;s only English-language daily. His longtime girlfriend Sandra Dawn Conklin (subsequently Sondi Wright) joined him in Rio. They married on May 19, 1963, shortly after returning to the United States, and lived briefly in Aspen, Colorado. Sandy was eight months pregnant when they relocated to Glen Ellen, California. Their son, Juan Fitzgerald Thompson, was born in March 1964. During the summer of that same year, Hunter began taking Dexedrine, which is what he would predominantly use for writing up until around 1974 when he began to write mostly under the influence of cocaine.

Thompson continued to write for the &quot;National Observer&quot; on an array of domestic subjects during the early 60s. One story told of his 1964 visit to Ketchum, Idaho, to investigate the reasons for Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s suicide. While there, he stole a pair of elk antlers hanging above the front door of Hemingway&#x27;s cabin. Later that year, Thompson moved to San Francisco, where he attended the 1964 GOP Convention at the Cow Palace. Thompson severed his ties with the &quot;Observer&quot; after his editor refused to print his review of Tom Wolfe&#x27;s 1965 essay-collection &quot;The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby&quot;. He later immersed himself in the drug and hippie culture taking root in the area, and soon began writing for the Berkeley underground paper &quot;Spider&quot;.

===&quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;===


In 1965, Carey McWilliams, editor of &quot;The Nation&quot;, hired Thompson to write a story about the Hells Angels motorcycle club in California. At the time, Thompson was living in a house near San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, where the Hells Angels lived across from the Grateful Dead. His article appeared on May 17, 1965, after which he received several book offers and spent the next year living and riding with the club. The relationship broke down when the bikers perceived that Thompson was exploiting them for personal gain and demanded a share of his profits. An argument at a party resulted in Thompson suffering a savage beating (or &quot;stomping&quot;, as the Angels referred to it) when Thompson intervened to protect a dog and a woman from physical abuse by a punk. Random House published the hard cover &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs&quot; in 1966, and the fight between Thompson and the Angels was well-marketed. CBC Television even broadcast an encounter between Thompson and Hells Angel Skip Workman before a live studio audience.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; review praised the work as an &quot;angry, knowledgeable, fascinating, and excitedly written book&quot;, that shows the Hells Angels &quot;not so much as dropouts from society but as total misfits, or unfits—emotionally, intellectually and educationally unfit to achieve the rewards, such as they are, that the contemporary social order offers&quot;. The reviewer also praised Thompson as a &quot;spirited, witty, observant, and original writer; his prose crackles like motorcycle exhaust&quot;.

Thompson also aided Danny Lyon in his role as photographer with the Outlaws Motorcycle Club, telling Lyon that he should not join the club unless &quot;it was absolutely necessary for photo action&quot;.

==Late 1960s==
Following the success of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Thompson sold stories to several national magazines, including &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Pageant&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;.

In 1967, shortly before the Summer of Love, Thompson wrote &quot;The &#x27;Hashbury&#x27; is the Capital of the Hippies&quot; for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. He criticized San Francisco&#x27;s hippies as devoid of both the political convictions of the New Left and the artistic core of the Beats, resulting in a culture overrun with young people who spent their time in the pursuit of drugs. &quot;The thrust is no longer for &#x27;change&#x27; or &#x27;progress&#x27; or &#x27;revolution&#x27;, but merely to escape, to live on the far perimeter of a world that might have been – perhaps should have been – and strike a bargain for survival on purely personal terms,&quot; he wrote.

Later that year, Thompson and his family moved back to Colorado and rented a house in Woody Creek, a small mountain hamlet outside Aspen. In early 1969, Thompson received a $15,000 royalty check for the paperback sales of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; and used a portion of the proceeds on a down payment on a home and property where he would live for the rest of his life. It was a 110-acre piece of land that cost him $75,000. He named the house Owl Farm and often described it as his &quot;fortified compound&quot;.

In early 1968, Thompson signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. According to Thompson&#x27;s letters from the period, he planned to write a book called &quot;The Joint Chiefs&quot; about &quot;the death of the American Dream.&quot; He used a $6,000 advance from Random House to travel the country covering the 1968 United States presidential election and attend the Democratic National Convention in Chicago for research. He watched the clashes between police and anti-war protesters from his hotel, and later claimed that events had a significant effect on his political views, saying &quot;I went to the Democratic convention as a journalist and returned a raving beast.&quot; While Thompson never completed the book, he carried its theme into later work. He also signed a deal with Ballantine Books in 1968 to write a satirical book called &quot;The Johnson File&quot; about President Lyndon B. Johnson. A few weeks later, the deal fell through after Johnson withdrew from the election.

Thompson was impressed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s coverage of the disastrous Altamont Free Concert in December 1969. After writing to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s editor, Jann Wenner, Thompson accepted an invitation to submit his work to the magazine, which soon became his primary outlet.

==Middle years==
===Aspen sheriff campaign===


In 1970, Thompson ran for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado, as part of a group of citizens running for local offices on the &quot;Freak Power&quot; ticket. The platform included promoting the decriminalization of drugs (for personal use only, not trafficking, as he disapproved of profiteering), tearing up the streets and turning them into grassy pedestrian malls, banning any building so tall as to obscure the view of the mountains, disarming all police forces, and renaming Aspen &quot;Fat City&quot; to deter investors. Thompson, having shaved his head, referred to the crew cut-wearing Republican candidate as &quot;my long-haired opponent&quot;.

With polls showing him with a slight lead in a three-way race, Thompson appeared at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine headquarters in San Francisco with a six-pack of beer in hand, and declared to editor Jann Wenner that he was about to be elected sheriff of Aspen, Colorado, and wished to write about the &quot;Freak Power&quot; movement. &quot;The Battle of Aspen&quot; was Thompson&#x27;s first feature for the magazine carrying the byline &quot;By: Dr. Hunter S. Thompson (Candidate for Sheriff)&quot;. (Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Dr&quot; certification was obtained from a mail-order church while he was in San Francisco in the sixties.) Despite the publicity, Thompson lost the election. While carrying the city of Aspen, he garnered only 44% of the county-wide vote in what had become, after the withdrawal of the Republican candidate, a two-way race. Thompson later said that the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article mobilized more opposition to the Freak Power ticket than supporters. The episode was the subject of the 2020 documentary film &quot;Freak Power: The Ballot or the Bomb.&quot; Writing of the episode more than fifty years later, Wenner wrote &quot;Aspen didn&#x27;t get a new sheriff, but I realized that, in Hunter, I had a fellow traveller.&quot;

===Birth of Gonzo===

Also in 1970, Thompson wrote an article entitled &quot;The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved&quot; for the short-lived new journalism magazine &quot;Scanlan&#x27;s Monthly&quot;. For that article, editor Warren Hinckle paired Thompson with illustrator Ralph Steadman, who drew expressionist illustrations with lipstick and eyeliner. Thompson&#x27;s story virtually ignored the race and focused instead on the drunken revelry surrounding the annual event in his hometown. Writing in the first person, he sets the debauchery against the backdrop of the American political scene of the moment: President Richard Nixon had ordered bombing of Cambodia and four students had been killed by Ohio National Guard troops at Kent State University, in a massacre which occurred only two days later.

Thompson and Steadman collaborated regularly after that. Although it was not widely read, the article was the first to use the techniques of Gonzo journalism, a style Thompson later employed in almost every literary endeavor. The manic first-person subjectivity of the story was reportedly the result of sheer desperation; he was facing a looming deadline and started sending the magazine pages ripped out of his notebook.

The first use of the word &quot;Gonzo&quot; to describe Thompson&#x27;s work is credited to the journalist Bill Cardoso, who first met Thompson on a bus full of journalists covering the 1968 New Hampshire primary. In 1970, Cardoso (who was then the editor of &quot;The Boston Globe Sunday Magazine&quot;) wrote to Thompson praising the &quot;Kentucky Derby&quot; piece as a breakthrough: &quot;This is it, this is pure Gonzo. If this is a start, keep rolling.&quot; According to Steadman, Thompson took to the word right away and said, &quot;Okay, that&#x27;s what I do. Gonzo.&quot; Thompson&#x27;s first published use of the word appears in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;: &quot;Free Enterprise. The American Dream. Horatio Alger gone mad on drugs in Las Vegas. Do it &quot;now&quot;: pure Gonzo journalism.&quot;

===&quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;===

The book for which Thompson gained most of his fame began during the research for &quot;Strange Rumblings in Aztlan,&quot; an exposé for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on the 1970 killing of the Mexican American television journalist Rubén Salazar. Salazar had been shot in the head at close range with a tear-gas canister fired by officers of the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War. One of Thompson&#x27;s sources for the story was Oscar Zeta Acosta, a prominent Mexican American activist and attorney. Finding it difficult to talk in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles, Thompson and Acosta decided to travel to Las Vegas, and take advantage of an assignment by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; to write a 250-word photograph caption on the Mint 400 motorcycle race held there.

What was to be a short caption quickly grew into something else entirely. Thompson first submitted to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; a manuscript of 2,500 words, which was, as he later wrote, &quot;aggressively rejected&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; publisher Jann Wenner liked &quot;the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication — which gave me the push I needed to keep working on it&quot;, Thompson wrote. Wenner, describing his first impression of it years later, called it &quot;Sharp and insane&quot;.

To develop the story, Thompson and Acosta returned to Las Vegas to attend a drug enforcement conference. The two trips became the basis for &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, which Rolling Stone serialized in two parts in November 1971. Random House published a book version the following year. It is written as a first-person account by a journalist named Raoul Duke with Dr. Gonzo, his &quot;300-pound Samoan attorney&quot;, During the trip, Duke and his companion (always referred to as &quot;my attorney&quot;) become sidetracked by a search for the American Dream, with &quot;two bags of grass, 75 pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers ... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls.&quot;

Coming to terms with the failure of the 1960s countercultural movement is a major theme of the novel, and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised it as &quot;the best book yet written on the decade of dope&quot;. &quot;The Vegas Book&quot;, as Thompson referred to it, was a mainstream success and introduced his Gonzo journalism techniques to a wide public.

===&quot;Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail &#x27;72&quot;===


In 1971 Wenner agreed to assign Thompson to cover the 1972 United States presidential election for &quot;Rolling Stone.&quot; Thompson was paid a retainer of $1,000 per month () and rented a house near Rock Creek Park in Washington D.C. at the magazine&#x27;s expense. He was also given a deal to publish a book on the campaign after its conclusion, which subsequently appeared as &quot;Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail &#x27;72&quot; in early 1973. Insider books on presidential politics had become popular during the prior decade starting with Theodore H. White&#x27;s &quot;Making of the President&quot; series, the first of which appeared in 1961, with additional volumes in 1965 and 1969. Their success raised the overall profile of journalists assigned to cover the quadrennial presidential election in the U.S., and it became a common phrase among them to say they were &quot;...Doing a Teddy White,&quot; meaning they planned to write their own insider book on the campaign.

Wenner had decided that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; would cover the presidential election in part because of the passage in 1971 of the 26th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States which lowered the legal voting age from 21 to 18, making a large part of its mostly young readership suddenly eligible to vote. &quot;We intended to politicize our generation and wrest this stirring force away from the fake politics of the revolutionary,&quot; Wenner wrote in his memoirs of the plan to collaborate with Thompson.

Thompson&#x27;s first campaign piece for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; appeared as &quot;Fear and Loathing in Washington: Is This Trip Really Necessary?&quot; in the January 6, 1972, issue. The 14th and final installment appeared in the November 9 issue under the headline &quot;Ask Not For Whom The Bell Tolls...&quot;

Throughout the year, Thompson traveled with candidates running in the 1972 Democratic Party presidential primaries for the right to challenge the incumbent president, Republican Richard Nixon in the general election. Thompson&#x27;s coverage focused mainly on Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota, Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine, the early leader, and former vice-president Hubert Humphrey. Thompson supported McGovern and wrote critical coverage of the rival campaigns.

In the April 13 installment entitled &quot;Fear and Loathing: The Banshee Screams in Florida,&quot; Thompson relates how someone having apparently lifted his press credential, terrorized Muskie and his staff on a campaign train. The incident was later revealed to be an elaborate prank. In another installment, Thompson relates rumors — rumors he later admitted he had originated — that Muskie had become addicted to the psychoactive drug Ibogaine. The story damaged Muskie&#x27;s reputation and played a role in his loss of the nomination to McGovern. In another, he tracked down McGovern in a restroom to get a reaction quote after a senator from Iowa had switched his endorsement from McGovern to Muskie.

The series, and later, the book were both praised for breaking boundaries with a new approach to political journalism. The literary critic Morris Dickstein, wrote that Thompson had learned to &quot;approximate the effect of mind-blasting drugs in his prose style,&quot; and that he &quot;recorded the nuts and bolts of a presidential campaign with all the contempt and incredulity that other reporters must feel but censor out.&quot;

Frank Mankiewicz, McGovern&#x27;s campaign director, often described it as the &quot;most accurate and least factual&quot; account of the 1972 campaign. In one vivid, yet invented anecdote, Thompson describes how Mankiewicz had leapt out from behind a bush to attack him with a hammer. To an uninitiated reader, it might have been unclear at first if the action Thompson described was fanciful or factual, and that seemed to be part of the point. As biographer William McKeen wrote &quot;He wrote for his own amusement, and if others came along for the ride, that was all right.&quot;

==Fame and its consequences==
Thompson&#x27;s journalistic work began to seriously suffer after his trip to Africa to cover the Rumble in the Jungle—the world heavyweight boxing match between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali—in 1974. He missed the match while intoxicated at his hotel and did not submit a story to the magazine. As Wenner put it to the film critic Roger Ebert in the 2008 documentary &quot;Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson&quot;, &quot;After Africa, he just couldn&#x27;t write. He couldn&#x27;t piece it together&quot;. It was in 1973 that Thompson tried cocaine for the first time and various friends, family members, and editors remarked that its impact upon his productivity and creativity was devastating.

In 1975, Wenner assigned Thompson to travel to Vietnam to cover what appeared to be the end of the Vietnam War. Thompson arrived in Saigon just as South Vietnam was collapsing and as other journalists were leaving the country. Wenner allegedly canceled Thompson&#x27;s medical insurance, which strained Thompson&#x27;s relationship with &quot;Rolling Stone.&quot; He soon fled the country and refused to file his report until the ten-year anniversary of the Fall of Saigon. Wenner, writing in 2022, denied the claims that he canceled Thompson&#x27;s insurance, saying that Thompson spent most of his time in Saigon obsessing over evacuation plans. Thompson filed an unfinished dispatch that Wenner described &quot;strong and promising, but nothing substantial.&quot; He then took a commercial flight to Bangkok where he met his wife for what Wenner described as a few weeks of &quot;totally undeserved rest and recreation.&quot; While in Thailand, Thompson had a custom brass door plaque made that read &quot;Rolling Stone: Global Affairs Suite. Dr. Hunter S. Thompson&quot; marked with a map of the world and two lightning bolts. &quot;That was it,&quot; Wenner wrote. &quot;No story. Just that plaque.&quot; Thompson later finished the story in time for the 10-year anniversary of the Fall of Saigon.

Plans for Thompson to cover the 1976 presidential campaign for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and later publish a book fell through as Wenner dissolved Straight Arrow Press&#x27; book publishing division. Thompson claimed Wenner canceled the project without informing him. In his memoirs, Wenner told a different story: &quot;The issue wasn&#x27;t money ... The real issue was whether he had the discipline to spend so much time on the campaign trail and whether he had that much to say about the same subject again.&quot; Thompson went on to spend a day with Jimmy Carter at the Georgia Governor&#x27;s Mansion and write a 10,000-word cover story endorsing Carter for president. &quot;After that, we were virtually an official part of the Carter campaign, and they treated us as such,&quot; Wenner wrote of the episode.

From the late 1970s on, most of Thompson&#x27;s literary output appeared as a four-volume series of books entitled &quot;The Gonzo Papers&quot;. Beginning with &quot;The Great Shark Hunt&quot; in 1979 and ending with &quot;Better Than Sex&quot; in 1994, the series is largely a collection of rare newspaper and magazine pieces from the pre-Gonzo period, along with almost all of his &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; pieces.

Starting around 1980, Thompson became less active by his standards. Aside from paid appearances, he largely retreated to his compound in Woody Creek, rejecting projects and assignments or failing to complete them. Despite a lack of new material, Wenner kept Thompson on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; masthead as chief of the &quot;National Affairs Desk&quot;, a position he held until his death.

In 1980, Thompson divorced his wife, Sandra Conklin. The same year marked the release of &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot;, a loose film adaptation based on Thompson&#x27;s early 1970s work, starring Bill Murray as the writer. Murray eventually became one of Thompson&#x27;s trusted friends. Later that year, Thompson relocated to Hawaii to research and write &quot;The Curse of Lono&quot;, a Gonzo-style account of the 1980 Honolulu Marathon. Extensively illustrated by Ralph Steadman, an iteration of the work first appeared in &quot;Running&quot; in 1981 as &quot;The Charge of the Weird Brigade&quot; and was later excerpted in &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1983. The book was a disappointment, with its editor calling it &quot;disorganized and incoherent.&quot; It was poorly reviewed, and sales were disappointing.

In 1983, he covered the U.S. invasion of Grenada but did not write or discuss the experiences until the publication of &quot;Kingdom of Fear&quot; in 2003. Also in 1983, at the behest of Terry McDonell, he wrote &quot;A Dog Took My Place&quot;, an exposé for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; of the scandalous Roxanne Pulitzer divorce case and what he called the &quot;Palm Beach lifestyle&quot;. The story included dubious insinuations of bestiality. Wenner described it as one of Thompson&#x27;s &quot;least-known but best pieces.&quot; In 1985, Thompson accepted an advance to write about &quot;feminist pornography&quot; for &quot;Playboy&quot;. As part of his research, he spent evenings at the Mitchell Brothers O&#x27;Farrell Theatre striptease club in San Francisco. The experience evolved into an as-yet-unpublished novel tentatively entitled &quot;The Night Manager&quot;.

Thompson next accepted a role as weekly media columnist and critic for &quot;The San Francisco Examiner.&quot; The position was arranged by former editor and fellow &quot;Examiner&quot; columnist Warren Hinckle. As his editor at &quot;The Examiner&quot;, David McCumber described, &quot;One week it would be acid-soaked gibberish with a charm of its own. The next week it would be incisive political analysis of the highest order.&quot;

Many of these columns were collected in &quot;Gonzo Papers, Vol. 2: Generation of Swine: Tales of Shame and Degradation in the &#x27;80s&quot; (1988) and &quot;Gonzo Papers, Vol. 3: Songs of the Doomed: More Notes on the Death of the American Dream&quot; (1990), a collection of autobiographical reminiscences, articles, and previously unpublished material.

==Later years==
Thompson faced a sexual assault charge in March 1990 when former pornographic film director Gail Palmer claimed that after she denied his sexual advances while at his home, Thompson threw a drink at her and twisted her left breast. He was tried for five felonies and three misdemeanors owing to the assault charge and allegations of drug abuse after the police raided his home. The charges were dropped two months later.

Throughout the early 1990s, Thompson claimed to be at work on a novel entitled &quot;Polo Is My Life&quot;. It was briefly excerpted in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1994. Wenner described it as &quot;Hunter&#x27;s last big piece of feature writing,&quot; and described Thompson as abusive toward two editorial assistants assigned to him. Thompson himself described it in 1996 as &quot;a sex book—you know, sex, drugs, and rock and roll. It&#x27;s about the manager of a sex theater who&#x27;s forced to leave and flee to the mountains. He falls in love and gets in even more trouble than he was in the sex theater in San Francisco.&quot; The novel was slated to be released by Random House in 1999, and was even assigned , but was never published.

Thompson continued to publish irregularly in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, ultimately contributing 17 pieces to the magazine between 1984 and 2004. &quot;Fear and Loathing in Elko,&quot; published in 1992, was a well-received fictional rallying cry against the nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the Supreme Court of the United States. &quot;Trapped in Mr. Bill&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot; was a largely factual account of an interview with Bill Clinton at a Little Rock, Arkansas, steakhouse. Rather than traveling the campaign trail as he had done in previous presidential elections, Thompson monitored the proceedings on cable television; &quot;Better Than Sex: Confessions of a Political Junkie&quot;, his account of the 1992 presidential campaign, is composed of reactive faxes to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 1994, the magazine published &quot;He Was a Crook&quot;, a &quot;scathing&quot; obituary of Richard Nixon.

In November 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published Thompson&#x27;s final magazine feature &quot;The Fun-Hogs in the Passing Lane: Fear and Loathing, Campaign 2004&quot;, a brief account of the 2004 presidential election in which he compared the outcome of the &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; court case to the Reichstag fire and formally endorsed Senator John Kerry, a longtime friend, for president.

===&quot;Fear and Loathing&quot; redux===
In 1996, Modern Library reissued &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; along with &quot;Strange Rumblings in Aztlan,&quot; &quot;The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved,&quot; and &quot;Jacket Copy for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&quot; Two years later, the film &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; generated new interest in Thompson and his work, and a paperback edition was published as a tie-in. The same year, an early novel, &quot;The Rum Diary&quot;, was published. Two volumes of collected letters also appeared during this time. 
Thompson&#x27;s next, and penultimate, collection, &quot;Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star-Crossed Child in the Final Days of the American Century&quot;, was widely publicized as Thompson&#x27;s first memoir. Published in 2003, it combined new material (including reminiscences of the O&#x27;Farrell Theater), selected newspaper and digital clippings, and other older works.

Thompson finished his journalism career in the same way it had begun: writing about sports. From 2000 until his death in 2005, he wrote a weekly column for ESPN.com&#x27;s Page 2 entitled &quot;Hey, Rube.&quot; In 2004, Simon &amp; Schuster collected some of the columns from the first few years and released them in mid-2004 as &quot;Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness&quot;.

Thompson married assistant Anita Bejmuk on April 23, 2003.

==Death==
At 5:42 pm on February 20, 2005, Thompson died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at Owl Farm, his &quot;fortified compound&quot; in Woody Creek, Colorado. His son Juan, daughter-in-law Jennifer, and grandson were visiting for the weekend. His wife Anita, who was at the Aspen Club, was on the phone with him as he cocked the gun. According to the &quot;Aspen Daily News&quot;, Thompson asked her to come home to help him write his ESPN column, then set the receiver on the counter. Anita said she mistook the cocking of the gun for the sound of his typewriter keys and hung up as he fired. Will, his grandson, and Jennifer were in the next room when they heard the gunshot, but mistook the sound for a book falling and did not check on Thompson immediately. Juan Thompson found his father&#x27;s body. According to the police report and Anita&#x27;s cell phone records, he called the sheriff&#x27;s office half an hour later, then walked outside and fired three shotgun blasts into the air to &quot;mark the passing of his father.&quot; The police report stated that in Thompson&#x27;s typewriter was a piece of paper with the date &quot;Feb. 22 &#x27;05&quot; and a single word, &quot;counselor.&quot;

Years of alcohol and cocaine abuse contributed to his problem with depression. Thompson&#x27;s inner circle told the press that he had been depressed and always found February a &quot;gloomy&quot; month, with football season over and the harsh Colorado winter weather. He was also upset over his advancing age and chronic medical problems, including a hip replacement; he would frequently mutter &quot;This kid is getting old.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published what Douglas Brinkley described as a suicide note written by Thompson to his wife, titled &quot;Football Season Is Over.&quot; It read:

Thompson&#x27;s collaborator and friend Ralph Steadman wrote:

===Funeral===
On August 20, 2005, in a private funeral at Owl Farm, Thompson&#x27;s ashes were fired from a cannon. This was accompanied by red, white, blue, and green fireworks—all to the tune of Norman Greenbaum&#x27;s &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. The cannon was placed atop a tower which had the shape of a double-thumbed fist clutching a peyote button, a symbol originally used in his 1970 campaign for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado. The plans for the monument were initially drawn by Thompson and Steadman, and were shown as part of an &quot;Omnibus&quot; program on the BBC titled &quot;Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision&quot; (1978). It is included as a special feature on the second disc of the 2004 Criterion Collection DVD release of &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, and labeled as &quot;Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood&quot;.

According to his widow, Anita, the $3 million funeral was funded by actor Johnny Depp, who was a close friend of Thompson&#x27;s. Depp told the Associated Press, &quot;All I&#x27;m doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true. I just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out.&quot; An estimated 280 people attended, including Steadman; U.S. Senators John Kerry and George McGovern; &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondents Ed Bradley and Charlie Rose; actors Jack Nicholson, John Cusack, Bill Murray, Benicio del Toro, Sean Penn, and Josh Hartnett; and musicians Lyle Lovett, John Oates and David Amram.

==Legacy==
===Writing style===

Thompson is often credited as the creator of Gonzo journalism, a style of writing that blurs distinctions between fiction and nonfiction. His work and style are considered to be a major part of the New Journalism literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to break free from the purely objective style of mainstream reportage of the time. Thompson almost always wrote in the first person, while extensively using his own experiences and emotions to color &quot;the story&quot; he was trying to follow.

Despite him having personally described his work as &quot;Gonzo&quot;, it fell to later observers to articulate what the phrase actually meant. While Thompson&#x27;s approach clearly involved injecting himself as a participant in the events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. Thompson, in a 1974 interview in &quot;Playboy&quot; addressed the issue himself, saying, &quot;Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They&#x27;re both much better reporters than I am, but then, I don&#x27;t think of myself as a reporter.&quot; Tom Wolfe would later describe Thompson&#x27;s style as &quot;... part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric.&quot; Or as one description of the differences between Thompson and Wolfe&#x27;s styles would elaborate, &quot;While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a fly in the ointment.&quot;

The majority of Thompson&#x27;s most popular and acclaimed work appeared within the pages of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. Publisher Jan Wenner said Thompson was &quot;in the DNA of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&quot;. Along with Joe Eszterhas and David Felton, Thompson was instrumental in expanding the focus of the magazine past music criticism; indeed, Thompson was the only staff writer of the epoch never to contribute a music feature to the magazine. Nevertheless, his articles were always peppered with a wide array of pop music references ranging from Howlin&#x27; Wolf to Lou Reed. Armed with early fax machines wherever he went, he became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazine&#x27;s San Francisco offices as an issue was about to go to press.

Wenner said Thompson tended to work &quot;in long bursts of energy, awake until dawn or, too often, two dawns.&quot; He said keeping Thompson on track when finishing a piece required &quot;...companionship, or what editors call hand-holding, but in Hunter&#x27;s case it was more like being a junior officer in his war. He required his creature comforts, which meant the right kind of typewriter and a certain color paper, Wild Turkey, the right drugs, and the proper music.&quot;

Robert Love, Thompson&#x27;s editor of 23 years at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, wrote in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; that &quot;the dividing line between fact and fancy rarely blurred, and we didn&#x27;t always use italics or some other typographical device to indicate the lurch into the fabulous. But if there were living, identifiable humans in a scene, we took certain steps ... Hunter was a close friend of many prominent Democrats, veterans of the ten or more presidential campaigns he covered, so when in doubt, we&#x27;d call the press secretary. &#x27;People will believe almost any twisted kind of story about politicians or Washington,&#x27; he once said, and he was right.&quot;

Discerning the line between the fact and fiction of Thompson&#x27;s work presented a practical problem for editors and fact-checkers. Love called fact-checking Thompson&#x27;s work &quot;one of the sketchiest occupations ever created in the publishing world&quot;, and &quot;for the first-timer ... a trip through a journalistic fun house, where you didn&#x27;t know what was real and what wasn&#x27;t. You knew you had better learn enough about the subject at hand to know when the riff began and reality ended. Hunter was a stickler for numbers, for details like gross weight and model numbers, for lyrics and caliber, and there was no faking it.&quot;

===Persona===
Thompson often used a blend of fiction and fact when portraying himself in his writing, too, sometimes using the name Raoul Duke as an author surrogate whom he generally described as a callous, erratic, self-destructive journalist, constantly drinking and taking hallucinogenics. In the early 1980s, Wenner spoke with Thompson about his alcoholism and addiction to cocaine, and offered to pay for drug treatment. &quot;Hunter was polite and firm;&quot; Wenner wrote in 2022. &quot;He had thought about it and didn&#x27;t feel he could or would change. He felt that [his drug abuse] was a key to his talent. He said that if he didn&#x27;t do drugs, he would have the mind of an accountant. The abuse was already taking a toll on his gifts... It was just too late, and he knew it.&quot;

In the late 1960s, Thompson acquired the title of &quot;Doctor&quot; from the Church of the New Truth.

A number of critics have commented that as he grew older, the line that distinguished Thompson from his literary self became increasingly blurred. Thompson admitted during a 1978 BBC interview that he sometimes felt pressured to live up to the fictional self that he had created, adding, &quot;I&#x27;m never sure which one people expect me to be. Very often, they conflict—most often, as a matter of fact. ... I&#x27;m leading a normal life and right alongside me there is this myth, and it is growing and mushrooming and getting more and more warped. When I get invited to, say, speak at universities, I&#x27;m not sure if they are inviting Duke or Thompson. I&#x27;m not sure who to be.&quot;

Thompson&#x27;s writing style and eccentric persona gave him a cult following in both literary and drug circles, and his cult status expanded into broader areas after being portrayed three times in major motion pictures. Hence, both his writing style and persona have been widely imitated, and his likeness has even become a popular costume choice for Halloween.

===Political beliefs===
Thompson was a firearms and explosives enthusiast (in his writing and in life) and owned a large collection of handguns, rifles, shotguns, and various automatic and semiautomatic weapons, along with numerous forms of gaseous crowd-control and many homemade devices. He was a proponent of the right to bear arms and privacy rights. A member of the National Rifle Association of America, Thompson was also co-creator of the Fourth Amendment Foundation, an organization to assist victims in defending themselves against unwarranted search and seizure.

Part of his work with the Fourth Amendment Foundation centered around support of Lisl Auman, a Colorado woman who was sentenced for life in 1997 under felony murder charges for the death of police officer Bruce VanderJagt, despite contradictory statements and dubious evidence. Thompson organized rallies, provided legal support, and co-wrote an article in the June 2004 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; outlining the case. The Colorado Supreme Court eventually overturned Auman&#x27;s sentence in March 2005, shortly after Thompson&#x27;s death, and Auman is now free. Auman&#x27;s supporters claim Thompson&#x27;s support and publicity resulted in the successful appeal.

Thompson was also an ardent supporter of drug legalization and became known for his detailed accounts of his own drug use. He was an early supporter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and served on the group&#x27;s advisory board for over 30 years, until his death. He told an interviewer in 1997 that drugs should be legalized &quot;[a]cross the board. It might be a little rough on some people for a while, but I think it&#x27;s the only way to deal with drugs. Look at Prohibition; all it did was make a lot of criminals rich.&quot;

In a 1965 letter to his friend Paul Semonin, Thompson explained an affection for the Industrial Workers of the World, &quot;I have in recent months come to have a certain feeling for Joe Hill and the Wobbly crowd who, if nothing else, had the right idea. But not the right mechanics. I believe the IWW was probably the last human concept in American politics.&quot; In another letter to Semonin, Thompson wrote that he agreed with Karl Marx, and compared him to Thomas Jefferson. In a letter to William Kennedy, Thompson confided that he was &quot;coming to view the free enterprise system as the single greatest evil in the history of human savagery.&quot; In the documentary &quot;Breakfast with Hunter&quot;, Thompson is seen in several scenes wearing different Che Guevara T-shirts. Additionally, actor and friend Benicio del Toro has stated that Thompson kept a &quot;big&quot; picture of Che in his kitchen. Thompson wrote on behalf of African-American rights and the civil rights movement. He strongly criticized the dominance in American society of what he called &quot;white power structures&quot;.

After the September 11 attacks, Thompson voiced skepticism regarding the official story on who was responsible for the attacks. He speculated to several interviewers that it had been conducted by the U.S. government or with the government&#x27;s assistance, though readily admitting he had no way to prove his theory.

In 2004, Thompson wrote: &quot;[Richard] Nixon was a professional politician, and I despised everything he stood for—but if he were running for president this year against the evil Bush–Cheney gang, I would happily vote for him.&quot;

=== Scholarships ===
Thompson&#x27;s widow established two scholarship funds at Columbia University School of General Studies for U.S. military veterans and the University of Kentucky for journalism students.
Colorado NORML created the Hunter S. Thompson Scholarship to pay all expenses for a lawyer or law student to attend the NORML Legal Committee Conference in Aspen, generally the first few days of June each year. The funding from a silent auction has paid for two winners for some years. Many winners have gone on to become important cannabis lawyers on state and national levels.

==Works==
==Awards, accolades, and tributes==
* Thompson was named a Kentucky Colonel by the governor of Kentucky in a December 1996 tribute ceremony where he also received keys to the city of Louisville.
* Dale Gribble, a main character on Fox&#x27;s animated sitcom &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, is based on Thompson in terms of appearance and lifestyle.
*Uncle Duke of the comic strip Doonesbury began as a straightforward parody of Thompson&#x27;s alter ego Raoul Duke. Though he has morphed over time into having his own history and traits, his core persona of being a drug- and gun- loving trickster is clearly rooted in Thompson&#x27;s Duke. While the character initially annoyed Thompson a great deal, he later said that &quot;it no longer bothers me.&quot;
* Author Tom Wolfe has called Thompson the greatest American comic writer of the 20th century.
* Asked in an interview with Jody Denberg on KGSR Studio, in 2000, whether he would ever consider writing a book &quot;like [his] buddy Hunter S. Thompson&quot;, the musician Warren Zevon responded: &quot;Let&#x27;s remember that Hunter S. Thompson is the finest writer of our generation; he didn&#x27;t just toss off a book the other day...&quot;
* Thompson appeared on the cover of the 1,000th issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, May 18 – June 1, 2006, as a devil playing the guitar next to the two &quot;L&quot;&#x27;s in the word &quot;Rolling&quot;. Johnny Depp also appeared on the cover.
* Many have suggested that General Hunter Gathers in the Adult Swim animated series &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; is a tribute to Thompson, as they have a similar name, mannerisms, and physical appearance.
*In the Cameron Crowe film &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, based on Crowe&#x27;s experiences writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; while on the road with the fictional band Stillwater&quot;, the writer is on the phone with an actor portraying Jann Wenner. Wenner tells the young journalist that he &quot;is not there to join the party, we already have one Hunter Thompson&quot; after the young writer amassed large hotel and traveling expenses and is overheard to be sharing his room with several young women.
*Eric C. Shoaf donated a cache of approximately 800 items (in librarian terms, about 35–40 linear feet of material on a shelf) pertaining to the life and career of Thompson to the University of California at Santa Cruz. Shoaf also published a descriptive bibliography, &quot;Gonzology: A Hunter Thompson Bibliography&quot;, of the works of Hunter S. Thompson with over 1,000 entries, many never before documented appearances in print, hundreds of biographical entries about Thompson&#x27;s life, full descriptions of all his primary works, preface by William McKeen, Phd, and photo section with rare and exclusive items depicted.
*An imaginary version of Thompson, played by P.J. Sosko, is a recurring character in the television series &quot;The Girls on the Bus&quot; (2024). He turns up to advise the young journalist Sadie McCarthy, who is a great admirer of Thompson and the only person who sees and hears him.

<text>Historicism is an approach to explaining the existence of phenomena, especially social and cultural practices (including ideas and beliefs), by studying the process or history by which they came about. The term is widely used in philosophy, anthropology, and sociology.

This historical approach to explanation differs from and complements the approach known as functionalism, which seeks to explain a phenomenon, such as for example a social form, by providing reasoned arguments about how that social form fulfills some function in the structure of a society. In contrast, rather than taking the phenomenon as a given and then seeking to provide a justification for it from reasoned principles, the historical approach asks &quot;Where did this come from?&quot; and &quot;What factors led up to its creation?&quot;; that is, historical explanations often place a greater emphasis on the role of process and contingency.

Historicism is often used to help contextualize theories and narratives, and may be a useful tool to help understand how social and cultural phenomena came to be.

The historicist approach differs from individualist theories of knowledge such as strict empiricism and rationalism, which does not take into account traditions. Historicism can be reductionist, often tends to be, and is usually contrasted with theories that posit that historical changes occur entirely at random.

David Summers, building on the work of E. H. Gombrich, defines historicism negatively, writing that it posits &quot;that laws of history are formulatable and that in general the outcome of history is predictable,&quot; adding &quot;the idea that history is a universal matrix prior to events, which are simply placed in order within that matrix by the historian.&quot; This approach, he writes, &quot;seems to make the ends of history visible, thus to justify the liquidation of groups seen not to have a place in the scheme of history&quot; and that it has led to the &quot;fabrication of some of the most murderous myths of modern times.&quot;

== History of the term ==
The term &quot;historicism&quot; (&quot;Historismus&quot;) was coined by German philosopher Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel. Over time, what historicism is and how it is practiced have developed different and divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher G. B. Vico (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the dialectic of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of Karl Marx, influenced by Hegel, also occasionally include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of Franz Boas. Historicism tends to be hermeneutic because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or relativist, because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.

==Variants==
===Hegelian===
Hegel viewed the realization of human freedom as the ultimate purpose of history, which could be achieved only through the creation of the perfect state. Historical progress toward this state would occur through a dialectical process: the tension between the purpose of humankind (freedom) and humankind&#x27;s current condition would produce the attempt by humankind to change its condition to one more in accord with its nature. However, because humans are often not aware of the goal of humanity and history, the process of achieving freedom is necessarily one of self-discovery.

Hegel saw progress toward freedom as conducted by the &quot;spirit&quot; (Geist), a seemingly supernatural force that directs all human actions and interactions. Yet Hegel makes clear that the spirit is a mere abstraction that comes into existence &quot;through the activity of finite agents&quot;. Thus, Hegel&#x27;s determining forces of history may not have a metaphysical nature, though many of his opponents and interpreters have understood him as holding metaphysical and determinist views.

Hegel&#x27;s historicism also suggests that any human society and all human activities such as science, art, or philosophy, are defined by their history. Consequently, their essence can be sought only by understanding said history. The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only continues but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel&#x27;s famous dialectic teaching usually summarized by the slogan &quot;thesis, antithesis, and synthesis&quot;. (Hegel did not use these terms, although Johann Fichte did.) Hegel&#x27;s famous aphorism, &quot;Philosophy is the history of philosophy&quot;, describes it bluntly.

Hegel&#x27;s position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist opinion of human societies and social activities self-defining on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a social contract. Hegel considers the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by language, and language is based on etymology and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten metaphors. To understand why a person is the way he is, you must examine that person in his society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that influenced it. The &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;, the &quot;Spirit of the Age&quot;, is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a tabula rasa, or blank slate, opinion, such that individuals are defined by their interactions.

These ideas can be interpreted variously. The Right Hegelians, working from Hegel&#x27;s opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, interpreted Hegel&#x27;s historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions. Hegel&#x27;s conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth-century romantic nationalism and its twentieth-century excesses. The Young Hegelians, by contrast, interpreted Hegel&#x27;s thoughts on societies influenced by social conflict for a doctrine of social progress, and attempted to manipulate these forces to cause various results. Karl Marx&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;historical inevitabilities&quot; and historical materialism is one of the more influential reactions to this part of Hegel&#x27;s thought. Significantly, Karl Marx&#x27;s theory of alienation argues that capitalism disrupts traditional relationships between workers and their work.

Hegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the dialectic and his conception of logic as representing the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the &quot;modern&quot; need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:
In modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order — worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.
This opinion that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would become an influential question in philosophy, namely, the requirements for individuality. It would be considered by Nietzsche, John Dewey and Michel Foucault directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel&#x27;s challenge. The Romantic period emphasized the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke&#x27;s infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might emphasize a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.

===Anthropological===
In the context of anthropology and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. Historical Particularism is associated with the work of Franz Boas. His theory used the diffusionist concept that there were a few &quot;cradles of civilization&quot; which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances. The school of historicism grew in response to unilinear theories that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by Charles Darwin and many of his students, their application as applied in social Darwinism and general evolution characterized in the theories of Herbert Spencer and Leslie White, historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. Julian Steward refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the cultural ecology, by specific evolution. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.

The primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by emphasizing the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this opinion, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named &quot;historicism&quot;.

This opinion would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.

===New Historicism===
Since the 1950s, when Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, within which individuals are inexorably entangled, many post-structuralists have used &quot;historicism&quot; to describe the opinion that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised. Answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question. This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought is sometimes given the name of &quot;New Historicism&quot;. The same term, &quot;new historicism&quot; is also used for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a poem, drama, etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of its society. Stephen Greenblatt is an example of this school.

===Modern Historicism===
Within the context of 20th-century philosophy, debates continue as to whether ahistorical and immanent methods were sufficient to understand the meaning (that is to say, &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; positivism) or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation—that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference—a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This opinion is often seen as deriving from the work of Benedetto Croce. Recent historians using this tradition include Thomas Kuhn.

Talcott Parsons criticized historicism as a case of idealistic fallacy in &quot;The Structure of Social Action&quot; (1937). Post-structuralism uses the term &quot;new historicism&quot;, which has some associations with both anthropology and Hegelianism.

===Christian Historicism===

====Eschatological====
In Christianity, the term &quot;historicism&quot; refers to the confessional Protestant form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of biblical prophecy has occurred throughout history and continues to occur; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.

====Dogmatic and ecclesiastic====
There is also a particular opinion in ecclesiastical history and in the history of dogmas which has been described as historicist by Pope Pius XII in the encyclical &quot;Humani generis&quot;. &quot;They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries.&quot; &quot;There is also a certain historicism, which attributing value only to the events of man&#x27;s life, overthrows the foundation of all truth and absolute law, both on the level of philosophical speculations and especially to Christian dogmas.&quot;

==Critics==

===Marxism===
Western Marxists such as Karl Korsch, Antonio Gramsci and the early Georg Lukacs emphasise the roots of Marx&#x27;s thought in Hegel. They interpret Marxism as a historically relativist philosophy, which views ideas (including Marxist theory) as products of the historical epochs that create them. In this view, Marxism is not an objective social science, but rather a theoretical expression of the class consciousness of the working class within a historical process. This understanding of Marxism is strongly criticised by the structural Marxist Louis Althusser, who affirms that Marxism is an objective science, autonomous from interests of society and class. Marxism is, therefore, often associated with deterministic claims of future historical development, but these are not structural parts of Marxism as a style of critique which requires distinction between various critical registers, which at once develops an understanding of broad historical-geographical tensions without prophesying a specific outcome.

===Karl Popper===

Karl Popper used the term &quot;historicism&quot; in his influential books &quot;The Poverty of Historicism&quot; and &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;, to mean: &quot;an approach to the social sciences which assumes that &quot;historical prediction&quot; is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the &#x27;rhythms&#x27; or the &#x27;patterns&#x27;, the &#x27;laws&#x27; or the &#x27;trends&#x27; that underlie the evolution of history&quot;. Popper condemned historicism along with the determinism and holism which he argued formed its basis, claiming that historicism had the potential to inform dogmatic, ideological beliefs not predicated upon facts that were falsifiable. In &quot;The Poverty of Historicism&quot;, he identified historicism with the opinion that there are &quot;inexorable laws of historical destiny&quot;, an opinion he warned against. If this seems to contrast with what proponents of historicism argue for, in terms of contextually relative interpretation, this happens, according to Popper, only because such proponents are unaware of the type of causality they ascribe to history. Popper wrote with reference to Hegel&#x27;s theory of history, which he criticized extensively.

In &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;, Popper attacks &quot;historicism&quot; and its proponents, among whom he identifies and singles out Hegel, Plato and Marx—calling them all &quot;enemies of the open society&quot;. The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and deterministic pattern to history, evade the responsibility of the individual to make free contributions to the evolution of society, hence leading to totalitarianism. Throughout this work, he defines his conception of historicism as: &quot;The central historicist doctrine—the doctrine that history is controlled by specific historical or evolutionary laws whose discovery would enable us to prophesy the destiny of man.&quot; As mentioned above, such characterizations of Marx in particular are not entirely accurate to Marx in his own right, and has drawn criticism from philosophers such as Lakatos for mischaracterizing the defense of induction in historical materialism. Other philosophers such as Walter Kaufmann have also been critical of Popper, calling his reading of Hegel a “myth,” “known largely through secondary sources…”

Another of his targets is what he terms &quot;moral historicism&quot;, the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel&#x27;s words, that &quot;history is the world&#x27;s court of justice&quot;. Popper says that he does not believe &quot;that success proves anything or that history is our judge&quot;. Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.

He also attacks what he calls &quot;Historism&quot;, which he regards as distinct from historicism. By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits.

===Leo Strauss===
Leo Strauss used the term &quot;historicism&quot; and reportedly termed it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom insofar as it denies any attempt to address injustice-pure-and-simple (such is the significance of historicism&#x27;s rejection of &quot;natural right&quot; or &quot;right by nature&quot;). Strauss argued that historicism &quot;rejects political philosophy&quot; (insofar as this stands or falls by questions of permanent, trans-historical significance) and is based on the belief that &quot;all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch.&quot; Strauss further identified R. G. Collingwood as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language. Countering Collingwood&#x27;s arguments, Strauss warned against historicist social scientists&#x27; failure to address real-life problems—most notably that of tyranny—to the extent that they relativize (or &quot;subjectivize&quot;) all ethical problems by placing their significance strictly in function of particular or ever-changing socio-material conditions devoid of inherent or &quot;objective&quot; &quot;value&quot;. Similarly, Strauss criticized Eric Voegelin&#x27;s abandonment of ancient political thought as guide or vehicle in interpreting modern political problems.

In his books, &quot;Natural Right and History&quot; and &quot;On Tyranny&quot;, Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of Hegel, Marx, and Heidegger. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in Edmund Burke, Tocqueville, Augustine, and John Stuart Mill. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that historicism grew out of and against Christianity and was a threat to civic participation, belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of progress that results from it, expose us to tyranny, totalitarianism, and democratic extremism. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled &quot;Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity&quot;, he argues that Islam, traditional Judaism, and ancient Greece, share a concern for sacred law that makes them especially susceptible to historicism, and therefore to tyranny.

<text>Hunter College is a public university in New York City, United States. It is one of the constituent colleges of the City University of New York and offers studies in more than one hundred undergraduate and postgraduate fields across five schools. It also administers Hunter College High School and Hunter College Elementary School.

Hunter was founded in 1870 as a women&#x27;s college; it first admitted male freshmen in 1946. The main campus has been located on Park Avenue since 1873. In 1943, Eleanor Roosevelt dedicated Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s and her former townhouse to the college; the building was reopened in 2010 as the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College. The institution has a 57% undergraduate graduation rate within six years.

==History==

===Founding===

Hunter College originates from the 19th-century movement for normal school training for teachers which swept across the United States. Hunter descends from the Female Normal and High School, established in New York City in 1870. It was founded by Thomas Hunter from Ardglass in County Down, who was an exile from Ireland because of his nationalist beliefs. The Normal School was one of several institutions occupying a site that the New York City government had reserved for &quot;institutions serving a public purpose&quot;. Hunter was president of the school during the first 37 years. It was originally a women&#x27;s college for training teachers. The school, which was housed in an armory and saddle store at Broadway and East Fourth Street in Manhattan, was open to all qualified women, irrespective of race, religion or ethnic background. At the time most women&#x27;s colleges had racial or ethno-religious admissions criteria.

Created by the New York State Legislature, Hunter was deemed the only approved institution for those seeking to teach in New York City. The school incorporated an elementary and high school for gifted children, where students practiced teaching. In 1887, a kindergarten was established as well. (Today, the elementary school and the high school still exist at a different location, and are now called the Hunter College Campus Schools.)

During Thomas Hunter&#x27;s tenure as president of the school, Hunter became known for its impartiality regarding race, religion, ethnicity, financial or political favoritism; its pursuit of higher education for women; its high entry requirements; and its rigorous academics. The first female professor at the school, Helen Gray Cone, was elected to the position in 1899. The college&#x27;s student population quickly expanded, and the college subsequently moved uptown, in 1873, into a new red brick Gothic structure facing Park Avenue between 68th and 69th Streets. It was one of several public institutions built at the time on a Lenox Hill lot that had been set aside by the city for a park, before the creation of Central Park. After the park in Lenox Hill was canceled, the plots were leased to institutions like Hunter College.

In 1888, the school was incorporated as a college under the statutes of New York State, taking on the name Normal College of the City of New York, with the power to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees. This led to the separation of the school into two &quot;camps&quot;: the &quot;Normals&quot;, who pursued a four-year course of study to become licensed teachers, and the &quot;Academics&quot;, who sought non-teaching professions and the Bachelor of Arts degree. After 1902 when the &quot;Normal&quot; course of study was abolished, the &quot;Academic&quot; course became standard across the student body.

===Expansion===
In 1913 the east end of the building, housing the elementary school, was replaced by Thomas Hunter Hall, a new limestone Tudor building facing Lexington Avenue and designed by C. B. J. Snyder. The following year the Normal College became Hunter College in honor of its first president. At the same time, the college was experiencing a period of great expansion as increasing student enrollments necessitated more space. The college reacted by establishing branches in the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. By 1920, Hunter College had the largest enrollment of women of any municipally financed college in the United States. In 1930, Hunter&#x27;s Brooklyn campus merged with City College&#x27;s Brooklyn campus, and the two were spun off to form Brooklyn College.

In February 1936 a fire destroyed the 1873 Gothic building facing Park Avenue. Plans for a new building were announced in 1937, and by 1940 the Public Works Administration replaced it with the Modernist north building, designed by Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon along with Harrison &amp; Fouilhoux.

The late 1930s saw the construction of Hunter College in the Bronx (later known as the Bronx Campus). During the Second World War, Hunter leased the Bronx Campus buildings to the United States Navy who used the facilities to train 95,000 women volunteers for military service as WAVES and SPARS. When the Navy vacated the campus, the site was briefly occupied by the nascent United Nations, which held its first Security Council sessions at the Bronx Campus in 1946, giving the school an international profile.

In 1943, Eleanor Roosevelt dedicated a town house at 47–49 East 65th Street in Manhattan to the college. The house had been a home for Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt prior to the latter&#x27;s presidency. The Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College opened at that location in fall 2010 as an academic center hosting prominent speakers.

===CUNY era===
Hunter became the women&#x27;s college of the municipal system, and in the 1950s, when City College became coeducational, Hunter started admitting men to its Bronx campus. In 1964, the Manhattan campus began admitting men also. The Bronx campus subsequently became Lehman College in 1968.

In 1968–1969, Black and Puerto Rican students struggled to get a department that would teach about their history and experience. These and supportive students and faculty expressed this demand through building take-overs, rallies, etc. In Spring 1969, Hunter College established Black and Puerto Rican Studies (now called Africana/Puerto Rican and Latino Studies). An &quot;open admissions&quot; policy initiated in 1970 by the City University of New York opened the school&#x27;s doors to historically underrepresented groups by guaranteeing a college education to any and all who graduated from NYC high schools. Many African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Puerto Ricans, and students from the developing world made their presence felt at Hunter, and even after the end of &quot;open admissions&quot; still comprise a large part of the school&#x27;s student body. As a result of this increase in enrollment, Hunter opened new buildings on Lexington Avenue during the early 1980s. In further advancing Puerto Rican studies, Hunter became home to the Centro de Estudios Puertorriqueños (&quot;Center for Puerto Rican Studies&quot; or simply &quot;Centro&quot;) in 1982.

In 2006, Hunter became home to the Bella Abzug Leadership Institute, which has training programs for young women to build their leadership, public speaking, business and advocacy skills.

==Campuses==

===Main campus===
Hunter College is anchored by its main campus at East 68th Street and Lexington Avenue, a modern complex of three towers – the East, West, and North Buildings – and Thomas Hunter Hall, all interconnected by skywalks. The institution&#x27;s official street address is 695 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10065. The address is based on the North Building, which stretches from 68th to 69th Streets along Park Avenue.

The main campus is situated two blocks east of Central Park, near many New York cultural institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Asia Society Museum, and the Frick Collection. The New York City Subway&#x27;s 68th Street–Hunter College station () on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line is directly underneath, and serves the entire campus. Adjacent to the staircase to the station, in front of the West Building, sat an iconic Hunter sculpture, &quot;Tau&quot;, created by late Hunter professor and artist Tony Smith.

The main campus is home to the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education. It features numerous facilities that serve not only Hunter, but the surrounding community, and is well known as a center for the arts. The Assembly Hall, which seats more than 2,000, is a major performance site; the Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse, a 675-seat proscenium theatre, has over 100,000 visitors annually and hosts over 200 performances each season; the Ida K. Lang Recital Hall is a fully equipped concert space with 148 seats; the Frederick Loewe Theatre, a 50 x black box performance space is the site of most department performances; and the Bertha and Karl Leubsdorf Art Gallery hosts professionally organized art exhibits.

Students have access to specialized learning facilities at the main campus, including the Dolciani Mathematics Learning Center, the Leona and Marcy Chanin Language Center, and the Physical Sciences Learning Center. Hunter has numerous research laboratories in the natural and biomedical sciences. These labs accommodate post-docs, PhD students from the CUNY Graduate School, and undergraduate researchers.

College sports and recreational programs are served by the Hunter Sportsplex, located below the West Building.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Hunter: In Brief, 12/1/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite campuses===
Hunter has two satellite campuses. The Silberman School of Social Work Building, located on Third Avenue between East 118th and East 119th Streets, houses the School of Social Work, the School of Urban Public Health, and the Brookdale Center on Aging. The Brookdale Campus, located at East 25th Street and First Avenue, houses the Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing, the Schools of the Health Professions, the Health Professions Library and several research centers and computer labs.

The Brookdale Campus is the site of the Hunter dormitory, which is home to over 600 undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a limited number of nurses employed at Bellevue Hospital. Prior to the opening of City College&#x27;s new &quot;Towers,&quot; the Brookdale complex was the City University&#x27;s only dormitory facility. In October 2022, New York Governor Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced that the Brookdale Campus would be replaced by the CUNY Science Park and Research Campus (SPARC), with construction set to begin in 2026. The campus is planned to contain space for Hunter College, Borough of Manhattan Community College, and the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health &amp; Health Policy.

===Other facilities===
The institution owns and operates property outside of its main campuses, including the MFA Building at 205 Hudson, Roosevelt House, Baker Theatre Building, Silberman School of Social Work, and the Hunter College Campus Schools. The MFA Studio Art program was formerly run out of a building on West 41st Street between 9th and 10th Avenues. It was a industrial space that students converted to studio space for the college&#x27;s BFA and MFA program. The current building in Tribeca now houses the Studio Art and Integrated Media Arts MFA program, and Art History MA program. Roosevelt House, located on East 65th Street, is the historic family home of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. Hunter&#x27;s Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute is now located there, honoring the public policy commitments of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. Baker Theatre Building located on 149 East 67th Street, New York, NY 10065 is the home of Hunter&#x27;s Department of Theatre thanks to the extraordinary generosity of Hunter trustee Patty Baker ’82 and her husband, Jay. The Silberman School of Social Work is located between 118th and 119th streets on 3rd Avenue. The Hunter Campus Schools—Hunter College High School and Hunter College Elementary School—are publicly funded schools for the intellectually gifted. Located at East 94th Street, the Campus Schools are among the nation&#x27;s oldest and largest elementary and secondary schools of their kind.

===Libraries===
The Leon &amp; Toby Cooperman Library entrance is located on the third-floor walkway level of the East Building. The Cooperman Library has individual and group study rooms, special facilities for students with disabilities, networked computer classrooms and labs for word processing and internet access.

The Social Work &amp; Urban Public Health Library, located on the main floor of the Silberman Building, (SWUPHL) serves the academic and research needs of the Silberman School of Social Work as well as Hunter’s Urban Public Health, Community Health Education, and Nutrition programs. 

Silberman patrons have remote access to the Hunter Libraries electronic collections which include 250,000 full-text eBooks, 100,000 eJournals, and over 300 electronic databases.  SWUPHL is a pick-up/drop-off site for the CUNY intra-library loan system (CLICS) that facilitates the sharing of books between all the CUNY libraries.  In addition, SWUPHL participates in the national interlibrary loan program for academic libraries. These reciprocal agreements allow the patrons of SWUPHL extensive access to a multitude of collections. 

The SWUPHL Faculty provide drop-in and by-appointment reference services, research consultations, classroom and individual instruction.  The library has 6 group study rooms, group and silent study areas, desktop computers, a laptop computer loan program, photocopiers, printing stations, and a book scanner. 

The Judith and Stanley Zabar Art Library, dedicated in December 2008, was made possible through the support of Judith Zabar, a member of the Hunter College Class of 1954, and her husband Stanley Zabar.  

==Academics==
Hunter is organized into four schools: The School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Education, the School of the Health Professions, and the School of Social Work. The institution had an undergraduate admissions acceptance rate of 36% in Fall 2018. Hunter offers over 120 undergraduate programs. These include 5 undergraduate certificates, 73 BA degree programs, 10 BS degree programs, and 25 bachelor&#x27;s-to-master&#x27;s joint degree programs.

<text>Harry Julius Shearer (born December 23, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, musician, radio host, writer, and producer. Born in Los Angeles, California, Shearer began his career as a child actor. From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of The Credibility Gap, a radio comedy group. Following the breakup of the group, Shearer co-wrote the film &quot;Real Life&quot; (1979) with Albert Brooks and worked as a writer on Martin Mull&#x27;s television series &quot;Fernwood 2 Night&quot;.

Shearer was a cast member on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; between 1979 and 1980, and 1984 and 1985. Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in the film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984), a satirical rockumentary, which became a hit. In 1989, he joined the cast of the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; he provides voices for characters including Mr. Burns, Waylon Smithers, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Lenny Leonard, Scratchy, Principal Skinner, Kent Brockman, Otto Mann, and formerly Dr. Hibbert. Shearer has appeared in films including &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998) and &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (2003), and has directed two, &quot;Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Big Uneasy&quot; (2010). Since 1983, Shearer has been the host of the public radio comedy/music program &quot;Le Show&quot;, incorporating satire, music, and sketch comedy. He has written three books.

Shearer has won a Primetime Emmy Award and has received several other Emmy and Grammy Award nominations. He has been married to singer-songwriter Judith Owen since 1993. He became an artist in residence at Loyola University, New Orleans in 2013.

==Early life and career==
Shearer was born December 23, 1943, in Los Angeles, California, the son of Dora, a bookkeeper, and Mack Shearer, a trained opera singer who ran a gas station. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland and Austria respectively. His parents escaped Nazi-occupied Europe and met in Havana, Cuba. As a child, Shearer and his family often listened to radio programs such as Bob and Ray and the weekly show for the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. His father died when he was 12 and he had his Bar Mitzvah the following year. Shearer grew up in the neighborhood of West Adams. Starting when Shearer was four years old, he had a piano teacher whose daughter worked as a child actress. The piano teacher later decided to make a career change and become a children&#x27;s agent, since she knew people in the business through her daughter&#x27;s work. The teacher asked Shearer&#x27;s parents for permission to take him to an audition. Several months later, she called Shearer&#x27;s parents and told them that she had gotten Shearer an audition for the radio show &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;. Shearer received the role when he was seven years old. He described Jack Benny as &quot;very warm and approachable ... He was a guy who dug the idea of other people on the show getting laughs, which sort of spoiled me for other people in comedy.&quot; Shearer has stated that one person who took him &quot;under his wing&quot; and was his mentor during his early days in show business was voice actor Mel Blanc, who voiced many animated characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Barney Rubble; Blanc was a regular on &quot;The Jack Benny Show&quot;. He also befriended Blanc&#x27;s son Noel. Shearer made his film debut in the film &quot;Abbott and Costello Go to Mars&quot; (1953), in which he had a small part, and appeared in &quot;The Robe&quot; (also 1953). Throughout his childhood and teenage years, he worked in television, film, and radio.

In 1957, Shearer played the precursor to the Eddie Haskell character in the pilot episode of the television series &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;. After the filming, Shearer&#x27;s parents said they did not want him to be a regular in a series. Instead they wanted him to just do occasional work so that he could have a normal childhood. Shearer and his parents made the decision not to accept the role in the series if it was picked up by a television network.

In the summer of 1960, Shearer volunteered as a driver for the Democratic National Convention during the 1960 U.S. Presidential election where he was regularly assigned trips to Disneyland. 

Shearer graduated from Los Angeles High School and attended UCLA as a political science major in the early 1960s. He decided to quit show business to become a &quot;serious person&quot;. However, he says this lasted approximately a month, and he joined the staff of the &quot;Daily Bruin&quot;, UCLA&#x27;s school newspaper, during his first year. He was editor of the college humor magazine (&quot;Satyr&quot;), including the June 1964 parody &quot;Preyboy&quot;. He also worked as a newscaster at KRLA, a top 40 radio station in Pasadena, during this period. According to Shearer, after graduating, he had &quot;a very serious agenda going on, and it was &#x27;Stay Out of the Draft&#x27;.&quot; He attended graduate school at Harvard University for one year and worked at the state legislature in Sacramento. From 1967 to 1968, he was a high school teacher, teaching English and social studies. He left teaching following &quot;disagreements with the administration&quot;.

From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of The Credibility Gap, a radio comedy group that included David Lander, Richard Beebe, and Michael McKean. The group consisted of &quot;a bunch of newsmen&quot; at KRLA 1110, &quot;the number two station&quot; in Los Angeles. They wanted to do more than just straight news, so they hired comedians who were talented vocalists. Shearer heard about the group from a friend, so he brought over a tape to the station and nervously gave it to the receptionist. He found out he was hired that same day. The group&#x27;s radio show was canceled in 1970 by KRLA and in 1971 by KPPC-FM, so they started performing in various clubs and concert venues. While at KRLA, Shearer also interviewed Creedence Clearwater Revival for the &quot;Pop Chronicles&quot; music documentary.

In 1973, Shearer appeared as Jim Houseafire on &quot;How Time Flys&quot;, an album by The Firesign Theatre&#x27;s David Ossman. The Credibility Gap broke up in 1976 when Lander and McKean left to perform in the sitcom &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;. Shearer started working with Albert Brooks, producing one of Brooks&#x27; albums and co-writing the film &quot;Real Life&quot; (1979). Shearer also started writing for Martin Mull&#x27;s television series &quot;Fernwood 2 Night&quot;. In the mid-1970s, he started working with Rob Reiner on a pilot for ABC. The show, which starred Christopher Guest, Tom Leopold and McKean, was not picked up.

==Career==
===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
====Initial run under Lorne Michaels====
In August 1979, Shearer was hired as a writer and cast member on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, one of the first additions to the show&#x27;s original 1975 cast. Recommended by Al Franken to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; creator Lorne Michaels, the acquisition of Shearer was seen as an unofficial replacement for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, who were both leaving the show.

Shearer describes his experience on the show as a &quot;living hell&quot; and &quot;not a real pleasant place to work.&quot; He did not get along well with the other writers and cast members and states that he was not included with the cast in the opening montage (although he was added to the montage for later episodes of the 1979–80 season) and that Michaels had told the rest of the cast that he was &quot;just a writer&quot;.

Michaels left &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the end of the fifth season, taking the entire cast with him. Shearer told new executive producer Jean Doumanian that he was &quot;not a fan of Lorne&#x27;s&quot; and offered to stay with the show if he was given the chance to overhaul the program and bring in experienced comedians, like Christopher Guest. However, Doumanian turned him down, so he decided to leave with the rest of the cast.

====Return in 1984 under Dick Ebersol====
In 1984, while promoting the film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, Shearer, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean performed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. All three members were offered the chance to join the show in the 1984–1985 season. Shearer accepted because he was treated well by the producers and he thought the backstage environment had improved but later stated that he &quot;didn&#x27;t realize that guests are treated better than the regulars.&quot; Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it, although he would join the cast in 1994.

Dick Ebersol, who replaced Lorne Michaels as the show&#x27;s producer, said that Shearer was &quot;a gifted performer but a pain in the butt. He&#x27;s just so demanding on the preciseness of things and he&#x27;s very, very hard on the working people. He&#x27;s just a nightmare-to-deal-with person.&quot; In January 1985, Shearer left the show for good, partially because he felt he was not being used enough. Martin Short said Shearer &quot;wanted to be creative and Dick [Ebersol] wanted something else. ... I think he felt his voice wasn&#x27;t getting represented on the show. When he wouldn&#x27;t get that chance, it made him very upset.&quot;

===Spinal Tap===
Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in Rob Reiner&#x27;s film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984). Shearer, Reiner, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest received a deal to write a first draft of a screenplay for a company called Marble Arch. They decided that the film could not be written and instead filmed a 20-minute demo of what they wanted to do. It was eventually greenlighted by Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio at Embassy Pictures. The film satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of hard rock and heavy metal bands, as well as the hagiographic tendencies of rockumentaries of the time. The three core members of the band Spinal Tap—David St. Hubbins, Derek Smalls and Nigel Tufnel—were portrayed by McKean, Shearer and Guest respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the film. There was no script, although there was a written breakdown of most of the scenes, and many of the lines were ad-libbed. It was filmed in 25 days.

Shearer said in an interview that &quot;The animating impulse was to do rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll right. The four of us had been around rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right.&quot; When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, &quot;No, this is a story that&#x27;s pretty familiar to people. We&#x27;re not introducing them to anything they don&#x27;t really know,&quot; so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and developed a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.
Shearer, Guest and McKean have since worked on several projects as their Spinal Tap characters. They released three albums: &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984), &quot;Break Like the Wind&quot; (1992) and &quot;Back from the Dead&quot; (2009). In 1992, Spinal Tap appeared in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; called &quot;The Otto Show&quot;. The band has played several concerts, including at Live Earth in London on July 7, 2007. In anticipation of the show, Rob Reiner directed a short film entitled &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;. In 2009, the band released &quot;Back from the Dead&quot; to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the release of the film. The album features re-recorded versions of songs featured in &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; and its soundtrack, and five new songs. The band performed a one-date &quot;world tour&quot; at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena on June 30, 2009. The Folksmen, a mock band featured in the film &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; that is also made up of characters played by Shearer, McKean and Guest, was the opening act for the show.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot;===
Shearer is known for his work as a voice actor on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Matt Groening, the creator of the show, was a fan of Shearer&#x27;s work, while Shearer was a fan of a column Groening used to write. When approached by Groening to be in the series, Shearer was initially reluctant because he thought the recording sessions would be too much trouble. He felt that voice acting was &quot;not a lot of fun&quot; as, traditionally, voice actors record their parts separately. He was told that the actors would record their lines together, and after three phone calls for executive producer James L. Brooks, Shearer was convinced to join the cast of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Shearer&#x27;s first impression of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was that it was funny. He – who thought it was a &quot;pretty cool&quot; way to work – found it peculiar that his fellow cast members were adamant about not being known to the public as the people behind the voices.

Shearer provides voices for Principal Skinner, Kent Brockman, Mr. Burns, Waylon Smithers, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, formerly Dr. Hibbert until 2021, Lenny Leonard, Otto Mann, Rainier Wolfcastle, Scratchy, Kang, Dr. Marvin Monroe, and Judge Snyder, among others. He has described all of his regular characters&#x27; voices as &quot;easy to slip into. ... I wouldn&#x27;t do them if they weren&#x27;t easy.&quot; Shearer modeled Mr. Burns&#x27;s voice on the two actors Lionel Barrymore and Ronald Reagan. Shearer says that Burns is the most difficult character for him to voice because it is rough on his vocal cords and he often needs to drink tea and honey to soothe his voice. He describes Burns as his favorite character, saying he &quot;like[s] Mr. Burns because he is pure evil. A lot of evil people make the mistake of diluting it. Never adulterate your evil.&quot; Shearer is also the voice of Burns&#x27; assistant Smithers, and is able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. In the episode &quot;Bart&#x27;s Inner Child&quot;, Shearer said &quot;wow&quot; in the voice of Otto, which was then used when Otto was seen jumping on a trampoline. Ned Flanders had been meant to be just a neighbor that Homer Simpson was jealous of, but because Shearer used &quot;such a sweet voice&quot; for him, Flanders was broadened to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would prefer to live next to over Homer. Dr. Marvin Monroe&#x27;s voice was based on psychiatrist David Viscott. Monroe has been largely retired since the seventh season barring a few cameo appearances because voicing the character strained Shearer&#x27;s throat.

In 2004, Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show&#x27;s declining quality: &quot;I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now.&quot; Shearer has also been vocal about &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; (season nine, episode two, 1997), one of the most controversial episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Principal Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, &quot;That&#x27;s &quot;so&quot; wrong. You&#x27;re taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we&#x27;ve done before with other characters. It&#x27;s so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it&#x27;s disrespectful to the audience.&quot; In a December 2006 interview, Shearer added, &quot;Now, [the writers] refuse to talk about it. They realize it was a horrible mistake. They never mention it. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re punishing [the audience] for paying attention.&quot;

Due to scheduling and availability conflicts, Shearer decided not to participate in &quot;The Simpsons Ride&quot;, which opened in 2008, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all. In a 2010 interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Shearer alluded that the reason he was not part of the ride was because he would not be getting paid for it. Similarly, Shearer was unable to appear in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; crossover episode &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot; due to further scheduling conflicts. Therefore, his characters are again mute. When asked about how he felt about the crossover, Shearer replied, &quot;Matter and anti-matter.&quot;

Until 1998, Shearer was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute, however, was resolved and Shearer received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode. The dispute was resolved a month later, and Shearer&#x27;s pay rose to $250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors received $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Shearer and the other cast members accepted a 30% pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode. On May 14, 2015, Shearer announced he was leaving the show. After the other voice actors signed a contract for the same pay, Shearer refused, stating it was not enough. Al Jean made a statement from the producers saying &quot;the show must go on,&quot; but did not elaborate on what might happen to the characters Shearer voiced. On July 7, 2015, Shearer agreed to continue with the show, on the same terms as the other voice actors.

===&quot;Le Show&quot; and radio work===
Since 1983, Shearer has been the host of the public radio comedy/music program &quot;Le Show&quot;. The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy that takes aim at the &quot;mega morons of the mighty media&quot;. It is carried on many National Public Radio and other public radio stations throughout the United States. Since the merger of SIRIUS and XM satellite radio services the program is no longer available on either. The show has also been made available as a podcast on iTunes and by WWNO. On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on the news of the day after the manner of Mort Sahl, and performing original (mostly political) comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called &quot;Songs of the Bushmen&quot;, consisting of his satirical numbers about former President George W. Bush on &quot;Le Show&quot;. Shearer says he criticizes both Republicans and Democrats equally, and also says that &quot;the iron law of doing comedy about politics is you make fun of whoever is running the place&quot; and that &quot;everyone else is just running around talking. They are the ones who are actually doing something, changing people&#x27;s lives for better or for worse. Other people the media calls &#x27;satirists&#x27; don&#x27;t work that way.&quot;

Since encountering satellite news feeds when he worked on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Shearer has been fascinated with the contents of the video that does not air. Shearer refers to these clips as found objects. &quot;I thought, wow, there is just an unending supply of this material, and it&#x27;s wonderful and fascinating and funny and sometimes haunting – but it&#x27;s always good,&quot; said Shearer. He collects this material and uses it on &quot;Le Show&quot; and on his website. In 2008, he assembled video clips of newsmakers from this collection into an art installation titled &quot;The Silent Echo Chamber&quot; which was exhibited at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut. The exhibit was also displayed in 2009 at Institut Valencià d&#x27;Art Modern (IVAM) in Valencia, Spain and in 2010 at the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center.

In 2006 Shearer appeared with Brian Hayes in four episodes of the BBC Radio 4 sitcom &quot;Not Today, Thank You&quot;, playing Nostrils, a man so ugly he cannot stand to be in his own presence. He was originally scheduled to appear in all six episodes but had to withdraw from recording two due to a problem with his work permit. On June 19, 2008, it was announced that Shearer would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the radio category.

===Further career===

Shearer&#x27;s first feature film as director, &quot;Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot;, which he also wrote, was released in 2002. The plot is based on Bohemian Grove, which hosts a three-week encampment of some of the most powerful men in the world. The film was not well received by critics. It garnered a 0% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with all 19 reviews being determined as negative and received a rating of 32 out of 100 (signifying &quot;generally negative reviews&quot;) on Metacritic from 10 reviews. In 2003, he co-wrote &quot;J. Edgar! The Musical&quot; with Tom Leopold, which spoofed J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s relationship with Clyde Tolson. It premiered at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado and starred Kelsey Grammer and John Goodman.

Shearer, Guest and McKean starred in the folk music mockumentary &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (2003), portraying a band called The Folksmen. The film was written by Guest and Eugene Levy, and directed by Guest. Shearer had a major role in the Guest-directed parody of Oscar politicking &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; released in 2006. He played Victor Allan Miller, a veteran actor who is convinced that he is going to be nominated for an Academy Award. He also appeared as a news anchor in &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998) with fellow &quot;The Simpsons&quot; cast members Hank Azaria and Nancy Cartwright. His other film appearances include &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983), &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991), &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998), &quot;Small Soldiers&quot; (also 1998), and &quot;EdTV&quot; (1999). He also directed and appeared in the television program &quot;Portrait of a White Marriage&quot; (1988), a sequel to &quot;The History of White People in America&quot;.

Shearer has also worked as a columnist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot;, but decided that it &quot;became such a waste of time to bother with it.&quot; His columns have also been published in &quot;Slate&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;. Since May 2005 he has been a contributing blogger at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. Shearer has written three books. &quot;Man Bites Town&quot;, published in 1993, is a collection of columns that he wrote for &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; between 1989 and 1992. Published in 1999, &quot;It&#x27;s the Stupidity, Stupid&quot; analyzed the hatred some people had for then-President Bill Clinton. Shearer believes that Clinton became disliked because he had an affair with &quot;the least powerful, least credentialed woman cleared into his official compound.&quot; His most recent book is &quot;Not Enough Indians&quot;, his first novel. Published in 2006, it is a comic novel about Native Americans and gambling. Without the &quot;pleasures of collaboration&quot; and &quot;spontaneity and improvisation which characterize his other projects&quot;, &quot;Not Enough Indians&quot; was a &quot;struggle&quot; for Shearer to write. He said that &quot;the only fun thing about it was having written it. It was lonely, I had no deal for it and it took six years to do. It was a profoundly disturbing act of self-discipline.&quot;

Shearer has released five solo comedy albums: &quot;It Must Have Been Something I Said&quot; (1994), &quot;Dropping Anchors&quot; (2006), &quot;Songs Pointed and Pointless&quot; (2007), &quot;Songs of the Bushmen&quot; (2008) and &quot;Greed and Fear&quot; (2010). His most recent CD, &quot;Greed and Fear&quot; is mainly about Wall Street economic issues, rather than politics like his previous albums. Shearer decided to make the album when he&quot;started getting amused by the language of the economic meltdown – when &#x27;toxic assets&#x27; suddenly became &#x27;troubled assets,&#x27; going from something poisoning the system to just a bunch of delinquent youth with dirty faces that needed not removal from the system but just ... understanding.&quot; In May 2006, Shearer received an honorary doctorate from Goucher College.

===&quot;The Big Uneasy&quot;===

Shearer is the director of &quot;The Big Uneasy&quot; (2010), a documentary film about the impacts of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. Narrated by actor John Goodman, the film describes levee failures and catastrophic flooding in the New Orleans metropolitan area, and includes extended interviews with former LSU professor Ivor Van Heerden, Robert Bea, an engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and Maria Garzino, an engineer and contract specialist for the Los Angeles district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The film is critical of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its management of flood protection projects in Southern Louisiana. Shearer draws on numerous technical experts to maintain that Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s &quot;... tragic floods creating widespread damage were caused by manmade errors in engineering and judgment.&quot; On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 71% based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 6.85/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Big Uneasy&quot; offers an admittedly uneven – yet still worthy and well-intentioned – look at a horrific disaster&#x27;s aftermath.&quot;

==Personal life==
Shearer married folk singer Penelope Nichols in 1974. They divorced in 1977. He has been married to Welsh singer-songwriter Judith Owen since 1993. In 2005, the couple launched their own record label called Courgette Records. Shearer primarily resides in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana, but has homes in Santa Monica, California and Notting Hill, London. He first went to New Orleans in 1988 and has attended every New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival since.

Shearer often speaks and writes about the failure of the Federal levee system which flooded New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, blasting the coverage of it in the mainstream media and criticizing the role of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Prior to the DVD release of his film, &quot;The Big Uneasy&quot;, Shearer would hold screenings of the film at different venues and take questions from audience members.

<text>High fantasy, or epic fantasy, is a subgenre of fantasy defined by the epic nature of its setting or by the epic stature of its characters, themes, or plot. High fantasy is usually set in an alternative, fictional (&quot;secondary&quot;) world, rather than the &quot;real&quot; or &quot;primary&quot; world. This secondary world is usually internally consistent, but its rules differ from those of the primary world. By contrast, low fantasy is characterized by being set on Earth, the primary or real world, or a rational and familiar fictional world with the inclusion of magical elements.

==Characteristics==
The romances of William Morris, such as &quot;The Well at the World&#x27;s End&quot;, set in an imaginary medieval world, are sometimes regarded as the first examples of high fantasy. The works of J. R. R. Tolkien—especially &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;—are regarded as archetypal works of high fantasy. The term &quot;high fantasy&quot; was coined by Lloyd Alexander in a 1971 essay, &quot;High Fantasy and Heroic Romance&quot;, which was originally given at the New England Round Table of Children&#x27;s Librarians in October 1969.

Many high fantasy stories are told from the viewpoint of one main hero. Often, much of the plot revolves around their heritage or mysterious nature, along with a world-threatening problem. In many novels the hero is an orphan or unusual sibling, and frequently portrayed with an extraordinary talent for magic or combat. They begin the story young, if not as an actual child, or are portrayed as being very weak and/or useless.

The hero often begins as a childlike figure, but matures rapidly, experiencing a considerable gain in fighting/problem-solving abilities along the way.

The progress of the story leads to the character&#x27;s learning the nature of the unknown forces against them, that they constitute a force with great power and malevolence. The villains in such stories are usually completely evil and unrelatable.

&quot;High fantasy&quot; often serves as a broad term to include a number of different flavors of the fantasy genre, including epic fantasy, mythic fantasy, dark fantasy, and wuxia. It typically is not considered to include the sword and sorcery genre.

==Themes==
High fantasy has often been defined by its themes and messages. &quot;Good versus evil&quot; is a common one in high fantasy, and defining the character of evil is often an important theme in a work of high fantasy, such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The importance of the concept of good and evil can be regarded as the distinguishing mark between high fantasy and sword and sorcery. In many works of high fantasy, this conflict marks a deep concern with moral issues; in other works, the conflict is a power struggle, with, for instance, wizards behaving irresponsibly whether they are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;.

==Game settings==
Role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; with campaign settings like &quot;Dragonlance&quot; by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis and &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; by Ed Greenwood are a common basis for many fantasy books and many other authors continue to contribute to the settings.
