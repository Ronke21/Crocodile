<text>Project Mercury was the first human spaceflight program of the United States, running from 1958 through 1963. An early highlight of the Space Race, its goal was to put a man into Earth orbit and return him safely, ideally before the Soviet Union. Taken over from the US Air Force by the newly created civilian space agency NASA, it conducted 20 uncrewed developmental flights (some using animals), and six successful flights by astronauts. The program, which took its name from Roman mythology, cost $ (adjusted for inflation). The astronauts were collectively known as the &quot;Mercury Seven&quot;, and each spacecraft was given a name ending with a &quot;7&quot; by its pilot.

The Space Race began with the 1957 launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1. This came as a shock to the American public, and led to the creation of NASA to expedite existing US space exploration efforts, and place most of them under civilian control. After the successful launch of the Explorer 1 satellite in 1958, crewed spaceflight became the next goal. The Soviet Union put the first human, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, into a single orbit aboard Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961. Shortly after this, on May 5, the US launched its first astronaut, Alan Shepard, on a suborbital flight. Soviet Gherman Titov followed with a day-long orbital flight in August 1961. The US reached its orbital goal on February 20, 1962, when John Glenn made three orbits around the Earth. When Mercury ended in May 1963, both nations had sent six people into space, but the Soviets led the US in total time spent in space.

The Mercury space capsule was produced by McDonnell Aircraft, and carried supplies of water, food and oxygen for about one day in a pressurized cabin. Mercury flights were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, on launch vehicles modified from the Redstone and Atlas D missiles. The capsule was fitted with a launch escape rocket to carry it safely away from the launch vehicle in case of a failure. The flight was designed to be controlled from the ground via the Manned Space Flight Network, a system of tracking and communications stations; back-up controls were outfitted on board. Small retrorockets were used to bring the spacecraft out of its orbit, after which an ablative heat shield protected it from the heat of atmospheric reentry. Finally, a parachute slowed the craft for a water landing. Both astronaut and capsule were recovered by helicopters deployed from a US Navy ship.

The Mercury project gained popularity, and its missions were followed by millions on radio and TV around the world. Its success laid the groundwork for Project Gemini, which carried two astronauts in each capsule and perfected space docking maneuvers essential for crewed lunar landings in the subsequent Apollo program announced a few weeks after the first crewed Mercury flight.

==Creation==
Project Mercury was officially approved on October 7, 1958, and publicly announced on December 17. Originally called Project Astronaut, President Dwight Eisenhower felt that gave too much attention to the pilot. Instead, the name &quot;Mercury&quot; was chosen from classical mythology, which had already lent names to rockets like the Greek &quot;Atlas&quot; and Roman &quot;Jupiter&quot; for the SM-65 and PGM-19 missiles. It absorbed military projects with the same aim, such as the Air Force Man in Space Soonest.

=== Background ===
Following the end of World War II, a nuclear arms race evolved between the US and the Soviet Union (USSR). Since the USSR did not have bases in the western hemisphere from which to deploy bomber planes, Joseph Stalin decided to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles, which drove a missile race. The rocket technology in turn enabled both sides to develop Earth-orbiting satellites for communications, and gathering weather data and intelligence. Americans were shocked when the Soviet Union placed the first satellite into orbit in October 1957, leading to a growing fear that the US was falling into a &quot;missile gap&quot;. A month later, the Soviets launched Sputnik 2, carrying a dog into orbit. Though the animal was not recovered alive, it was obvious their goal was human spaceflight. Unable to disclose details of military space projects, President Eisenhower ordered the creation of a civilian space agency in charge of civilian and scientific space exploration. Based on the federal research agency National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), it was named the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The agency achieved its first goal of launching a satellite into space, the Pioneer 1, in 1958. The next goal was to put a man there.

The limit of space (also known as the Kármán line) was defined at the time as a minimum altitude of , and the only way to reach it was by using rocket-powered boosters. This created risks for the pilot, including explosion, high g-forces and vibrations during lift off through a dense atmosphere, and temperatures of more than from air compression during reentry.

In space, pilots would require pressurized chambers or space suits to supply fresh air. While there, they would experience weightlessness, which could potentially cause disorientation. Further potential risks included radiation and micrometeoroid strikes, both of which would normally be absorbed in the atmosphere. All seemed possible to overcome: experience from satellites suggested micrometeoroid risk was negligible, and experiments in the early 1950s with simulated weightlessness, high g-forces on humans, and sending animals to the limit of space, all suggested potential problems could be overcome by known technologies. Finally, reentry was studied using the nuclear warheads of ballistic missiles, which demonstrated a blunt, forward-facing heat shield could solve the problem of heating.

===Organization===
T. Keith Glennan had been appointed the first Administrator of NASA, with Hugh L. Dryden (last Director of NACA) as his Deputy, at the creation of the agency on October 1, 1958. Glennan would report to the president through the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The group responsible for Project Mercury was NASA&#x27;s Space Task Group, and the goals of the program were to orbit a crewed spacecraft around Earth, investigate the pilot&#x27;s ability to function in space, and to recover both pilot and spacecraft safely. Existing technology and off-the-shelf equipment would be used wherever practical, the simplest and most reliable approach to system design would be followed, and an existing launch vehicle would be employed, together with a progressive test program. Spacecraft requirements included: a launch escape system to separate the spacecraft and its occupant from the launch vehicle in case of impending failure; attitude control for orientation of the spacecraft in orbit; a retrorocket system to bring the spacecraft out of orbit; drag braking blunt body for atmospheric reentry; and landing on water. To communicate with the spacecraft during an orbital mission, an extensive communications network had to be built. In keeping with his desire to keep from giving the US space program an overtly military flavor, President Eisenhower at first hesitated to give the project top national priority (DX rating under the Defense Production Act), which meant that Mercury had to wait in line behind military projects for materials; however, this rating was granted in May 1959, a little more than a year and a half after Sputnik was launched.

===Contractors and facilities===

Twelve companies bid to build the Mercury spacecraft on a $20 million ($ adjusted for inflation) contract. In January 1959, McDonnell Aircraft Corporation was chosen to be prime contractor for the spacecraft. Two weeks earlier, North American Aviation, based in Los Angeles, was awarded a contract for Little Joe, a small rocket to be used for development of the launch escape system. The World Wide Tracking Network for communication between the ground and spacecraft during a flight was awarded to the Western Electric Company. Redstone rockets for suborbital launches were manufactured in Huntsville, Alabama, by the Chrysler Corporation and Atlas rockets by Convair in San Diego, California. For crewed launches, the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was made available by the USAF. This was also the site of the Mercury Control Center while the computing center of the communication network was in Goddard Space Center, Maryland. Little Joe rockets were launched from Wallops Island, Virginia. Astronaut training took place at Langley Research Center in Virginia, Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, Ohio, and Naval Air Development Center Johnsville in Warminster, PA. Langley wind tunnels together with a rocket sled track at Holloman Air Force Base at Alamogordo, New Mexico were used for aerodynamic studies. Both Navy and Air Force aircraft were made available for the development of the spacecraft&#x27;s landing system, and Navy ships and Navy and Marine Corps helicopters were made available for recovery. South of Cape Canaveral the town of Cocoa Beach boomed. From here, 75,000 people watched the first American orbital flight being launched in 1962.

== Spacecraft ==
The Mercury spacecraft&#x27;s principal designer was Maxime Faget, who started research for human spaceflight during the time of the NACA. It was long and wide; with the launch escape system added, the overall length was . With of habitable volume, the capsule was just large enough for a single crew member. Inside were 120 controls: 55 electrical switches, 30 fuses and 35 mechanical levers. The heaviest spacecraft, Mercury-Atlas 9, weighed fully loaded. Its outer skin was made of René 41, a nickel alloy able to withstand high temperatures.

The spacecraft was cone shaped, with a neck at the narrow end. It had a convex base, which carried a heat shield (Item 2 in the diagram below) consisting of an aluminum honeycomb covered with multiple layers of fiberglass. Strapped to it was a retropack (1) consisting of three rockets deployed to brake the spacecraft during reentry. Between these were three posigrade rockets: minor rockets for separating the spacecraft from the launch vehicle at orbital insertion. The straps that held the package could be severed when it was no longer needed. Next to the heat shield was the pressurized crew compartment (3). Inside, an astronaut would be strapped to a form-fitting seat with instruments in front of him and with his back to the heat shield. Underneath the seat was the environmental control system supplying oxygen and heat, scrubbing the air of CO2, vapor and odors, and (on orbital flights) collecting urine. The recovery compartment (4) at the narrow end of the spacecraft contained three parachutes: a drogue to stabilize free fall and two main chutes, a primary and reserve. Between the heat shield and inner wall of the crew compartment was a landing skirt, deployed by letting down the heat shield before landing. On top of the recovery compartment was the antenna section (5) containing both antennas for communication and scanners for guiding spacecraft orientation. Attached was a flap used to ensure the spacecraft was faced heat shield first during reentry. A launch escape system (6) was mounted to the narrow end of the spacecraft containing three small solid-fueled rockets which could be fired briefly in a launch failure to separate the capsule safely from its booster. It would deploy the capsule&#x27;s parachute for a landing nearby at sea. (See also Mission profile for details.)

The Mercury spacecraft did not have an on-board computer, instead relying on all computation for reentry to be calculated by computers on the ground, with their results (retrofire times and firing attitude) then transmitted to the spacecraft by radio while in flight. All computer systems used in the Mercury space program were housed in NASA facilities on Earth. (See Ground control for details.)

===Pilot accommodations===
The astronaut lay in a sitting position with his back to the heat shield, which was found to be the position that best enabled a human to withstand the high g-forces of launch and reentry. A fiberglass seat was custom-molded from each astronaut&#x27;s space-suited body for maximum support. Near his left hand was a manual abort handle to activate the launch escape system if necessary prior to or during liftoff, in case the automatic trigger failed.

To supplement the onboard environmental control system, he wore a pressure suit with its own oxygen supply, which would also cool him. A cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at a low pressure of (equivalent to an altitude of ) was chosen, rather than one with the same composition as air (nitrogen/oxygen) at sea level. This was easier to control, avoided the risk of decompression sickness (&quot;the bends&quot;), and also saved on spacecraft weight. Fires (which never occurred during the course of Project Mercury) would have to be extinguished by emptying the cabin of oxygen. In such case, or failure of the cabin pressure for any reason, the astronaut could make an emergency return to Earth, relying on his suit for survival. The astronauts normally flew with their visor up, which meant that the suit was not inflated. With the visor down and the suit inflated, the astronaut could only reach the side and bottom panels, where vital buttons and handles were placed.

The astronaut also wore electrodes on his chest to record his heart rhythm, a cuff that could take his blood pressure, and a rectal thermometer to record his temperature (this was replaced by an oral thermometer on the last flight). Data from these was sent to the ground during the flight. The astronaut normally drank water and ate food pellets.

Despite the lessons learnt from the U2 program, which also utilized a pressure suit, initially no urine collection device was included for the Mercury astronauts. An inquiry on the subject was made in February 1961 by a student, but NASA responded by stating that &quot;the first space man is not expected to have &#x27;to go&quot;. The expected short flight times meant that this was overlooked, although after Alan Shepard had a launch delay of four hours, he was forced to urinate in his suit, short-circuiting some of the electrodes monitoring his vital signs. Gus Grissom wore two rubber pants on the second Mercury flight as a crude workaround. It would take until the third flight in February 1962 before a dedicated urine collection device was installed.

Once in orbit, the spacecraft could be rotated in yaw, pitch, and roll: along its longitudinal axis (roll), left to right from the astronaut&#x27;s point of view (yaw), and up or down (pitch). Movement was created by rocket-propelled thrusters which used hydrogen peroxide as a fuel. For orientation, the pilot could look through the window in front of him or he could look at a screen connected to a periscope with a camera which could be turned 360°.

The Mercury astronauts had taken part in the development of their spacecraft, and insisted that manual control, and a window, be elements of its design. As a result, spacecraft movement and other functions could be controlled three ways: remotely from the ground when passing over a ground station, automatically guided by onboard instruments, or manually by the astronaut, who could replace or override the two other methods. Experience validated the astronauts&#x27; insistence on manual controls. Without them, Gordon Cooper&#x27;s manual reentry during the last flight would not have been possible.

===Development and production===

The Mercury spacecraft design was modified three times by NASA between 1958 and 1959. After bidding by potential contractors had been completed, NASA selected the design submitted as &quot;C&quot; in November 1958. After it failed a test flight in July 1959, a final configuration, &quot;D&quot;, emerged. The heat shield shape had been developed earlier in the 1950s through experiments with ballistic missiles, which had shown a blunt profile would create a shock wave that would lead most of the heat around the spacecraft. To further protect against heat, either a heat sink, or an ablative material, could be added to the shield. The heat sink would remove heat by the flow of the air inside the shock wave, whereas the ablative heat shield would remove heat by a controlled evaporation of the ablative material. After uncrewed tests, the latter was chosen for crewed flights. Apart from the capsule design, a rocket plane similar to the existing X-15 was considered. This approach was still too far from being able to make a spaceflight, and was consequently dropped. The heat shield and the stability of the spacecraft were tested in wind tunnels, and later in flight. The launch escape system was developed through uncrewed flights. During a period of problems with development of the landing parachutes, alternative landing systems such as the Rogallo glider wing were considered, but ultimately scrapped.

The spacecraft were produced at McDonnell Aircraft, St. Louis, Missouri, in clean rooms and tested in vacuum chambers at the McDonnell plant. The spacecraft had close to 600 subcontractors, such as Garrett AiResearch which built the spacecraft&#x27;s environmental control system. Final quality control and preparations of the spacecraft were made at Hangar S at Cape Canaveral. NASA ordered 20 production spacecraft, numbered 1 through 20. Five of the 20, Nos. 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19, were not flown. Spacecraft No. 3 and No. 4 were destroyed during uncrewed test flights. Spacecraft No. 11 sank and was recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after 38 years. Some spacecraft were modified after initial production (refurbished after launch abort, modified for longer missions, etc.). A number of Mercury boilerplate spacecraft (made from non-flight materials or lacking production spacecraft systems) were also made by NASA and McDonnell. They were designed and used to test spacecraft recovery systems and the escape tower. McDonnell also built the spacecraft simulators used by the astronauts during training, and adopted the motto &quot;First Free Man in Space&quot;.



==Launch vehicles==
===Launch escape system testing===
A launch vehicle called Little Joe was used for uncrewed tests of the launch escape system, using a Mercury capsule with an escape tower mounted on it. Its main purpose was to test the system at max q, when aerodynamic forces against the spacecraft peaked, making separation of the launch vehicle and spacecraft most difficult. It was also the point at which the astronaut was subjected to the heaviest vibrations. The Little Joe rocket used solid-fuel propellant and was originally designed in 1958 by NACA for suborbital crewed flights, but was redesigned for Project Mercury to simulate an Atlas-D launch. It was produced by North American Aviation. It was not able to change direction; instead its flight depended on the angle from which it was launched. Its maximum altitude was fully loaded. A Scout launch vehicle was used for a single flight intended to evaluate the tracking network; however, it failed and was destroyed from the ground shortly after launch.

===Suborbital flight===

The Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle was an (with capsule and escape system) single-stage launch vehicle used for suborbital (ballistic) flights. It had a liquid-fueled engine that burned alcohol and liquid oxygen producing about of thrust, which was not enough for orbital missions. It was a descendant of the German V-2, and developed for the U.S. Army during the early 1950s. It was modified for Project Mercury by removing the warhead and adding a collar for supporting the spacecraft together with material for damping vibrations during launch. Its rocket motor was produced by North American Aviation and its direction could be altered during flight by its fins. They worked in two ways: by directing the air around them, or by directing the thrust by their inner parts (or both at the same time). Both the Atlas-D and Redstone launch vehicles contained an automatic abort sensing system which allowed them to abort a launch by firing the launch escape system if something went wrong. The Jupiter rocket, also developed by Wernher von Braun&#x27;s team at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, was considered as well for intermediate Mercury suborbital flights at a higher speed and altitude than Redstone, but this plan was dropped when it turned out that man-rating Jupiter for the Mercury program would actually cost more than flying an Atlas due to economics of scale. Jupiter&#x27;s only use other than as a missile system was for the short-lived Juno II launch vehicle, and keeping a full staff of technical personnel around solely to fly a few Mercury capsules would result in excessively high costs.

===Orbital flight===
Orbital missions required use of the Atlas LV-3B, a man-rated version of the Atlas D which was originally developed as the United States&#x27; first operational intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) by Convair for the Air Force during the mid-1950s. The Atlas was a &quot;one-and-one-half-stage&quot; rocket fueled by kerosene and liquid oxygen (LOX). The rocket by itself stood high; total height of the Atlas-Mercury space vehicle at launch was .

The Atlas first stage was a booster skirt with two engines burning liquid fuel. This, together with the larger sustainer second stage, gave it sufficient power to launch a Mercury spacecraft into orbit. Both stages fired from lift-off with the thrust from the second stage sustainer engine passing through an opening in the first stage. After separation from the first stage, the sustainer stage continued alone. The sustainer also steered the rocket by thrusters guided by gyroscopes. Smaller vernier rockets were added on its sides for precise control of maneuvers.

== Astronauts ==

NASA announced the following seven astronauts – known as the Mercury Seven – on April 9, 1959:

Alan Shepard became the first American in space by making a suborbital flight on May 5, 1961. Mercury-Redstone 3, Shepard&#x27;s 15 minute and 28 second flight of the &quot;Freedom 7&quot; capsule demonstrated the ability to withstand the high g-forces of launch and atmospheric re-entry. Shepard later went on to fly in the Apollo program and became the only Mercury astronaut to walk on the Moon on Apollo 14.

Gus Grissom became the second American in space on Mercury-Redstone 4 on July 21, 1961. After the splashdown of &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot;, the side hatch opened and caused the capsule to sink although Grissom was able to be safely recovered. His flight also gave NASA the confidence to move on to orbital flights. Grissom went on to participate in the Gemini and Apollo programs, but died in January 1967 during a pre-launch test for Apollo 1.

John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth on Mercury-Atlas 6 February 20, 1962. During the flight, the spacecraft &quot;Friendship 7&quot; experienced issues with its automatic control system but Glenn was able to manually control the spacecraft&#x27;s attitude. He quit NASA in 1964, when he came to the conclusion that he likely would not be selected for any Apollo missions, and was later elected to the US Senate, serving from 1974 to 1999. During his tenure, he returned to space in 1998 as a Payload Specialist aboard STS-95.

Scott Carpenter was the second astronaut in orbit and flew on Mercury-Atlas 7 on May 24, 1962. The spaceflight was essentially a repeat of Mercury-Atlas 6, but a targeting error during re-entry took &quot;Aurora 7&quot; 250 miles (400 km) off-course, delaying recovery. Afterwards, he joined the Navy&#x27;s &quot;Man in the Sea&quot; program and is the only American to be both an astronaut and an aquanaut. Carpenter&#x27;s Mercury flight was his only trip into space.

Wally Schirra flew aboard &quot;Sigma 7&quot; on Mercury-Atlas 8 on October 3, 1962. The mission&#x27;s main goal was to show development of environmental controls or life-support systems that would allow for safety in space, thus being a flight mainly focused on technical evaluation, rather than scientific experimentation. The mission lasted 9 hours and 13 minutes, setting a new U.S. flight duration record. In December 1965, Schirra flew on Gemini 6A, achieving the first ever space rendezvous with sister spacecraft Gemini 7. Three years later, he commanded the first crewed Apollo mission, Apollo 7, becoming the first astronaut to fly three times and the only person to fly in the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.

Gordon Cooper made the last flight of Project Mercury with Mercury-Atlas 9 on May 15, 1963. His flight onboard &quot;Faith 7&quot; set another U.S. endurance record with a 34-hour and 19 minute flight duration, and 22 completed orbits. This mission marks the last time an American was launched alone to conduct an entirely solo orbital mission. Cooper later went on to participate in Project Gemini where he once again beat the endurance record during Gemini 5.

Deke Slayton was grounded in 1962 due to a heart condition, but remained with NASA and was appointed senior manager of the Astronaut Office and later additionally assistant director of Flight Crew Operations at the beginning of Project Gemini. On March 13, 1972, after doctors confirmed he no longer had a coronary condition, Slayton returned to flight status and the next year was assigned to the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, which successfully flew in 1975 with Slayton as the docking module pilot. After the ASTP, he managed the Space Shuttle Program&#x27;s Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) and Orbital Flight Tests (OFT) before retiring from NASA in 1982.

One of the astronauts&#x27; tasks was publicity; they gave interviews to the press and visited project manufacturing facilities to speak with those who worked on Project Mercury. The press was especially fond of John Glenn, who was considered the best speaker of the seven. They sold their personal stories to &quot;Life&quot; magazine which portrayed them as &#x27;patriotic, God-fearing family men.&#x27; &quot;Life&quot; was also allowed to be at home with the families while the astronauts were in space. During the project, Grissom, Carpenter, Cooper, Schirra and Slayton stayed with their families at or near Langley Air Force Base; Glenn lived at the base and visited his family in Washington DC on weekends. Shepard lived with his family at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia.

Other than Grissom, who was killed in the 1967 Apollo 1 fire, the other six survived past retirement and died between 1993 and 2016.


===Selection and training===
Prior to Project Mercury, there was no protocol for selecting astronauts, so NASA would set a far-reaching precedent with both their selection process and initial choices for astronauts. At the end of 1958, various ideas for the selection pool were discussed privately within the national government and the civilian space program, and also among the public at large. Initially, there was the idea to issue a widespread public call to volunteers. Thrill-seekers such as rock climbers and acrobats would have been allowed to apply, but this idea was quickly shot down by NASA officials who understood that an undertaking such as space flight required individuals with professional training and education in flight engineering. By late 1958, NASA officials decided to move forward with test pilots being the heart of their selection pool. On President Eisenhower&#x27;s insistence, the group was further narrowed down to active duty military test pilots, which set the number of candidates at 508. These candidates were USN or USMC naval aviation pilots (NAPs), or USAF pilots of Senior or Command rating. These aviators had long military records, which would give NASA officials more background information on which to base their decisions. Furthermore, these aviators were skilled in flying the most advanced aircraft to date, giving them the best qualifications for the new position of astronaut. During this time, women were banned from flying in the military and so could not successfully qualify as test pilots. This meant that no female candidates could earn consideration for the title of astronaut. Civilian NASA X-15 pilot Neil Armstrong was also disqualified, though he had been selected by the US Air Force in 1958 for its Man in Space Soonest program, which was replaced by Mercury. Although Armstrong had been a combat-experienced NAP during the Korean War, he left active duty in 1952. Armstrong became NASA&#x27;s first civilian astronaut in 1962 when he was selected for NASA&#x27;s second group, and became the first man on the Moon in 1969.

It was further stipulated that candidates should be between 25 and 40 years old, no taller than , and hold a college degree in a STEM subject. The college degree requirement excluded the USAF&#x27;s X-1 pilot, then-Lt Col (later Brig Gen) Chuck Yeager, the first person to exceed the speed of sound. He later became a critic of the project, ridiculing the civilian space program, labeling astronauts as &quot;spam in a can.&quot; John Glenn did not have a college degree either, but used influential friends to make the selection committee accept him. USAF Capt. (later Col.) Joseph Kittinger, a USAF fighter pilot and stratosphere balloonist, met all the requirements but preferred to stay in his contemporary project. Other potential candidates declined because they did not believe that human spaceflight had a future beyond Project Mercury. From the original 508, 110 candidates were selected for an interview, and from the interviews, 32 were selected for further physical and mental testing. Their health, vision, and hearing were examined, together with their tolerance to noise, vibrations, g-forces, personal isolation, and heat. In a special chamber, they were tested to see if they could perform their tasks under confusing conditions. The candidates had to answer more than 500 questions about themselves and describe what they saw in different images. Navy Lt (later Capt) Jim Lovell, who was later an astronaut in the Gemini and Apollo programs, did not pass the physical tests. After these tests it was intended to narrow the group down to six astronauts, but in the end it was decided to keep seven.

The astronauts went through a training program covering some of the same exercises that were used in their selection. They simulated the g-force profiles of launch and reentry in a centrifuge at the Naval Air Development Center, and were taught special breathing techniques necessary when subjected to more than 6 g. Weightlessness training took place in aircraft, first on the rear seat of a two-seater fighter and later inside converted and padded cargo aircraft. They practiced gaining control of a spinning spacecraft in a machine at the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory called the Multi-Axis Spin-Test Inertia Facility (MASTIF), by using an attitude controller handle simulating the one in the spacecraft. A further measure for finding the right attitude in orbit was star and Earth recognition training in planetaria and simulators. Communication and flight procedures were practiced in flight simulators, first together with a single person assisting them and later with the Mission Control Center. Recovery was practiced in pools at Langley, and later at sea with frogmen and helicopter crews.


==Mission profile==
===Suborbital missions===
A Redstone rocket was used to boost the capsule for 2 minutes and 30 seconds to an altitude of ; the capsule continued ascending on a ballistic curve after booster separation. The launch escape system was jettisoned at the same time. At the top of the curve, the spacecraft&#x27;s retrorockets were fired for testing purposes; they were not necessary for reentry because orbital speed had not been attained. The spacecraft landed in the Atlantic Ocean. The suborbital mission took about 15 minutes, had an apogee altitude of , and a downrange distance of . From the time of booster-spacecraft separation until reentry where air started to slow down the spacecraft, the pilot would experience weightlessness as shown on the image. The recovery procedure would be the same as an orbital mission.[AS]

===Orbital missions===

Preparations for a mission started a month in advance with the selection of the primary and back-up astronaut; they would practice together for the mission. For three days prior to launch, the astronaut went through a special diet to minimize his need for defecating during the flight. On the morning of the trip he typically ate a steak breakfast. After having sensors applied to his body and being dressed in the pressure suit, he started breathing pure oxygen to prepare him for the atmosphere of the spacecraft. He arrived at the launch pad, took the elevator up the launch tower and entered the spacecraft two hours before launch. Once the astronaut was secured inside, the hatch was bolted, the launch area evacuated and the mobile tower rolled back. After this, the launch vehicle was filled with liquid oxygen. The entire procedure of preparing for launch and launching the spacecraft followed a time table called the countdown. It started a day in advance with a pre-count, in which all systems of the launch vehicle and spacecraft were checked. After that followed a 15-hour hold, during which pyrotechnics were installed. Then came the main countdown which for orbital flights started 6½ hours before launch (T – 390 min), counted backwards to launch (T = 0) and then forward until orbital insertion (T + 5 min).

On an orbital mission, the Atlas&#x27; rocket engines were ignited four seconds before lift-off. The launch vehicle was held to the ground by clamps and then released when sufficient thrust was built up at lift-off (A). After 30 seconds of flight, the point of maximum dynamic pressure against the vehicle was reached, at which the astronaut felt heavy vibrations. After 2 minutes and 10 seconds, the two outboard booster engines shut down and were released with the aft skirt, leaving the center sustainer engine running (B). At this point, the launch escape system was no longer needed, and was separated from the spacecraft by its jettison rocket (C). The space vehicle moved gradually to a horizontal attitude until, at an altitude of , the sustainer engine shut down and the spacecraft was inserted into orbit (D). This happened after 5 minutes and 10 seconds in a direction pointing east, whereby the spacecraft would gain speed from the rotation of the Earth. Here the spacecraft fired the three posigrade rockets for a second to separate it from the launch vehicle. Just before orbital insertion and sustainer engine cutoff, g-loads peaked at 8 g (6 g for a suborbital flight). In orbit, the spacecraft automatically turned 180°, pointed the retropackage forward and its nose 14.5° downward and kept this attitude for the rest of the orbital phase to facilitate communication with the ground.

Once in orbit, it was not possible for the spacecraft to change its trajectory except by initiating reentry. Each orbit would typically take 88 minutes to complete. The lowest point of the orbit, called perigee, was at about altitude, and the highest point, called apogee, was about altitude. When leaving orbit (E), the angle of retrofire was 34° downward from the flight path angle. Retrorockets fired for 10 seconds each (F) in a sequence where one started 5 seconds after the other. During reentry (G), the astronaut would experience about 8 g (11–12 g on a suborbital mission). The temperature around the heat shield rose to and at the same time, there was a two-minute radio blackout due to ionization of the air around the spacecraft.

After reentry, a small, drogue parachute (H) was deployed at for stabilizing the spacecraft&#x27;s descent. The main parachute (I) was deployed at starting with a narrow opening that opened fully in a few seconds to lessen the strain on the lines. Just before hitting the water, the landing bag inflated from behind the heat shield to reduce the force of impact (J). Upon landing the parachutes were released. An antenna (K) was raised and sent out signals that could be traced by ships and helicopters. Further, a green marker dye was spread around the spacecraft to make its location more visible from the air. Frogmen brought in by helicopters inflated a collar around the craft to keep it upright in the water. The recovery helicopter hooked onto the spacecraft and the astronaut blew the escape hatch to exit the capsule. He was then hoisted aboard the helicopter that finally brought both him and the spacecraft to the ship.


==Ground control==

The number of personnel supporting a Mercury mission was typically around 18,000, with about 15,000 people associated with recovery. Most of the others followed the spacecraft from the World Wide Tracking Network, a chain of 18 stations placed around the equator, which was based on a network used for satellites and made ready in 1960. It collected data from the spacecraft and provided two-way communication between the astronaut and the ground. Each station had a range of and a pass typically lasted 7 minutes. Mercury astronauts on the ground would take the role of Capsule Communicator, or CAPCOM, who communicated with the astronaut in orbit. Data from the spacecraft were sent to the ground, processed at the Goddard Space Center by a redundant pair of transistorized IBM 7090 computers and relayed to the Mercury Control Center at Cape Canaveral. In the Control Center, the data were displayed on boards on each side of a world map, which showed the position of the spacecraft, its ground track and the place it could land in an emergency within the next 30 minutes.

Other computers associated with ground control for Mercury included a vacuum-tube-based IBM 709 system in Cape Canaveral which determined whether a mid-launch abort might be needed and where an aborting capsule would land, another IBM 709 in Bermuda which served as backup for the two IBM 7090 transistor-based machines at Goddard, and a Burroughs-GE system which provided radio guidance for the Atlas during launch.

The World Wide Tracking Network went on to serve subsequent space programs, until it was replaced by a satellite relay system in the 1980s. Mission Control Center was moved from Cape Canaveral to Houston in 1965.


==Flights==






On April 12, 1961, the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space on an orbital flight. Alan Shepard became the first American in space on a suborbital flight three weeks later, on May 5, 1961. John Glenn, the third Mercury astronaut to fly, became the first American to reach orbit on February 20, 1962, but only after the Soviets had launched a second cosmonaut, Gherman Titov, into a day-long flight in August 1961. Three more Mercury orbital flights were made, ending on May 16, 1963, with a day-long, 22 orbit flight. However, the Soviet Union ended its Vostok program the next month, with the human spaceflight endurance record set by the 82-orbit, almost 5-day Vostok 5 flight.

===Crewed===

All of the six crewed Mercury flights were successful, though some planned flights were canceled during the project (see below). The main medical problems encountered were simple personal hygiene, and post-flight symptoms of low blood pressure. The launch vehicles had been tested through uncrewed flights, therefore the numbering of crewed missions did not start with 1. Also, there were two separately numbered series: MR for &quot;Mercury-Redstone&quot; (suborbital flights), and MA for &quot;Mercury-Atlas&quot; (orbital flights). These names were not popularly used, since the astronauts followed a pilot tradition, each giving their spacecraft a name. They selected names ending with a &quot;7&quot; to commemorate the seven astronauts. Spacecraft production numbers don&#x27;t match the mission order, with some capsules being reserved as backup or used in tests. Times given are Coordinated Universal Time, local time + 5 hours. MA = Mercury-Atlas, MR = Mercury-Redstone, LC = Launch Complex.



===Uncrewed and chimpanzee flights===
The 20 uncrewed flights used Little Joe, Redstone, and Atlas launch vehicles. They were used to develop the launch vehicles, launch escape system, spacecraft and tracking network. One flight of a Scout rocket attempted to launch a specialized satellite equipped with Mercury communications components for testing the ground tracking network, but the booster failed soon after liftoff. The Little Joe program used seven airframes for eight flights, of which three were successful. The second Little Joe flight was named Little Joe 6, because it was inserted into the program after the first 5 airframes had been allocated. Production spacecraft and boilerplates were used for these test flights. 



===Canceled===

Nine of the planned flights were canceled. 

Mercury-Jupiter was a proposed suborbital launch configuration consisting of a Jupiter missile carrying a Mercury capsule. Two flights were planned in support of Project Mercury. The Mercury-Jupiter 1 flight would have been a heat shield test. The Mercury-Jupiter 2 flight was planned as a maximum dynamic pressure qualification test of the production Mercury spacecraft with a chimpanzee on board. On July 1, 1959, less than a year after the October, 1958 program start date, the flights were canceled due to budget constraints. 

Suborbital flights were planned for four other astronauts but the number of flights was cut down gradually and finally all remaining were canceled after Titov&#x27;s flight. 

Mercury-Atlas 9 was intended to be followed by more one-day flights and even a three-day flight but with the coming of the Gemini Project it seemed unnecessary. The Jupiter booster was, as mentioned above, intended to be used for different purposes.

==Legacy==
Today the Mercury program is commemorated as the first American human space program. It did not win the race against the Soviet Union, but gave back national prestige and was scientifically a successful precursor of later programs such as Gemini, Apollo and Skylab.

During the 1950s, some experts doubted that human spaceflight was possible. Still, when John F. Kennedy was elected president, many, including him, had doubts about the project. As president he chose to support the programs a few months before the launch of &quot;Freedom 7&quot;, which became a public success. Afterwards, a majority of the American public supported human spaceflight, and, within a few weeks, Kennedy announced a plan for a crewed mission to land on the Moon and return safely to Earth before the end of the 1960s.

The six astronauts who flew were awarded medals, driven in parades and two of them were invited to address a joint session of the US Congress. Seeing as no women previously met the qualifications for the astronaut program, the question was raised as to whether or not they could. This led to the development of a project named Mercury 13 by the media, in which thirteen American women successfully underwent the tests. The Mercury 13 program was not officially conducted by NASA. It was created by NASA physician William Randolph Lovelace, who developed the physical and psychological tests used to select NASA&#x27;s first seven male astronauts for Project Mercury. The women completed physical and psychological tests, but were never required to complete the training as the privately funded program was quickly cancelled. No female candidates adequately met the qualifications for the astronaut program until 1978, when a few finally qualified for the Space Shuttle program.

Military Highway in Hampton, Virginia and Newport News, Virginia was renamed to Mercury Boulevard.

On February 25, 2011, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the world&#x27;s largest technical professional society, awarded Boeing (the successor company to McDonnell Aircraft) a Milestone Award for important inventions which debuted on the Mercury spacecraft.

===Depictions on film===
A short documentary, &quot;The John Glenn Story&quot;, was released in 1962.

On film the program was portrayed in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, a 1983 adaptation of Tom Wolfe&#x27;s 1979 book of the same name, in the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, in the 2016 film &quot;Hidden Figures&quot;, and the 2020 Disney+ series &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, which is also based on the Tom Wolfe book.

===Commemorations===
In 1964, a monument commemorating Project Mercury was unveiled near Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral, featuring a metal logo combining the symbol of Mercury with the number 7. This design was first issued to the Mercury astronauts in 1960 as a lapel pin. In 1962, the United States Postal Service honored the Mercury-Atlas 6 flight with a Project Mercury commemorative stamp, the first US postal issue to depict a crewed spacecraft. 

===Displays===
The spacecraft that flew, together with some that did not, are on display in the United States. &quot;Friendship 7&quot; (Spacecraft No. 13) went on a global tour, popularly known as its &quot;fourth orbit&quot;.

===Patches===
Commemorative patches were designed by entrepreneurs after the Mercury program to satisfy collectors.

<text>Gaius Cilnius Maecenas ( 13 April 68 BC – 8 BC) was a friend and political advisor to Octavian (who later reigned as emperor Augustus). He was also an important patron for the new generation of Augustan poets, including both Horace and Virgil. In many languages, his name is an eponym for &quot;patron of arts&quot;.

During the reign of Augustus, Maecenas served as a quasi-culture minister to the Roman emperor but in spite of his wealth and power he chose not to enter the Senate, remaining of equestrian rank.

==Life==
Expressions in Propertius seem to imply that Maecenas had taken some part in the campaigns of Mutina, Philippi, and Perugia. He prided himself on his ancient Etruscan lineage, and claimed descent from the princely house of the Cilnii, who excited the jealousy of their townsmen by their preponderant wealth and influence at Arretium in the 4th century BC. Horace makes reference to this in his address to Maecenas at the opening of his first books of &quot;Odes&quot; with the expression &quot;atavis edite regibus&quot; (descendant of kings). Tacitus refers to him as &quot;Cilnius Maecenas&quot;; it is possible that &quot;Cilnius&quot; was his mother&#x27;s nomen – or that Maecenas was in fact a cognomen.
The Gaius Maecenas mentioned in Cicero as an influential member of the equestrian order in 91 BC may have been his grandfather, or even his father. The testimony of Horace and Maecenas&#x27;s own literary tastes imply that he had profited from the highest education of his time.

His great wealth may have been in part hereditary, but he owed his position and influence to his close connection with the emperor Augustus. He first appears in history in 40 BC, when he was employed by Octavian in arranging his marriage with Scribonia, and afterwards in assisting to negotiate the Treaty of Brundisium and the reconciliation with Mark Antony. As a close friend and advisor he had even acted as deputy for Augustus when he was abroad.

It was in 38 BC that Horace was introduced to Maecenas, who had before this received Lucius Varius Rufus and Virgil into his intimacy. In the &quot;Journey to Brundisium&quot;, in 37, Maecenas and Marcus Cocceius Nerva – great-grandfather of the future emperor Nerva – are described as having been sent on an important mission, and they were successful in patching up, by the Treaty of Tarentum, a reconciliation between the two claimants for supreme power. During the Sicilian war against Sextus Pompeius in 36, Maecenas was sent back to Rome, and was entrusted with supreme administrative control in the city and in Italy. He was vicegerent of Octavian during the campaign that led to the Battle of Actium, when, with great promptness and secrecy, he crushed the conspiracy of Lepidus the Younger; during the subsequent absences of his chief in the provinces he again held the same position.

During the latter years of his life as recorded by Suetonius he fell somewhat out of favour with his master. The historian attributes the loss of the imperial favour to Maecenas&#x27; having indiscreetly revealed to Terentia, his allegedly beautiful but difficult wife, the discovery of the conspiracy in which her brother Lucius Licinius Varro Murena was implicated, but according to Cassius Dio (writing in the early 3rd century AD) it was due to the emperor&#x27;s relations with Terentia. Maecenas died in 8 BC, leaving the emperor sole heir to his wealth.

==Reputation==
Opinions were much divided in ancient times as to his personal character; but the testimony as to his administrative and diplomatic ability was unanimous. He enjoyed the credit of sharing largely in the establishment of the new order of things, of reconciling parties, and of carrying the new empire safely through many dangers. To his influence especially were attributed the more humane policies of Octavian after his first alliance with Antony and Lepidus. 

The best summary of his character as a man and a statesman, by Marcus Velleius Paterculus, describes him as &quot;of sleepless vigilance in critical emergencies, far-seeing and knowing how to act, but in his relaxation from business more luxurious and effeminate than a woman.&quot; Expressions in the &quot;Odes of Horace&quot; seem to imply that Maecenas was deficient in the robustness of fibre which Romans liked to imagine was characteristic of their city.

==&quot;Maecenate&quot; (patronage)==
Maecenas is most famous for his support of young poets; hence, in most European languages, his name has become an eponym for &quot;patron of arts&quot;: in French, &quot;mécène&quot;; in Italian, &quot;mecenate&quot;; in Spanish, &quot;mecenas&quot;; in German, &quot;Mäzen&quot;; in Polish, &quot;mecenas&quot;; in Czech, &quot;mecenáš&quot;; in Hungarian, &quot;mécenás&quot;; in Ukrainian, Russian, and Bulgarian, &quot;меценат&quot;. The eponym has been in use since at least the composition of &quot;Laus Pisonis&quot; (&quot;Praise of Piso&quot;) by an unknown author in the first century CE. Edmund Spenser&#x27;s shepherds complain that there is no &quot;Mecoenas&quot; in England in the 1570s. 

Maecenas supported Virgil, who wrote the &quot;Georgics&quot; in his honour. It was Virgil, impressed with examples of Horace&#x27;s poetry, who introduced Horace to Maecenas. Indeed, Horace begins the first poem of his &quot;Odes&quot; (&quot;Odes&quot; I.i) by addressing his new patron. Maecenas gave him full financial support as well as an estate in the Sabine Mountains. Propertius and the minor poets Varius Rufus, Plotius Tucca, Valgius Rufus, and Domitius Marsus also were his protégés.

His character as a munificent patron of literature – which has made his name a household word – is gratefully acknowledged by the recipients of it and attested by the regrets of the men of letters of a later age, expressed by Martial and Juvenal. His patronage was exercised, not from vanity or a mere dilettante love of letters, but with a view to the higher interest of the state. He recognized in the genius of the poets of that time not only the truest ornament of the court, but the power of reconciling men&#x27;s minds to the new order of things, and of investing the actual state of affairs with an ideal glory and majesty. The change in seriousness of purpose between the &quot;Eclogues&quot; and the &quot;Georgics&quot; of Virgil was in a great measure the result of the direction given by the statesman to the poet&#x27;s genius. A similar change between the earlier odes of Horace, in which he declares his epicurean indifference to affairs of state, and the great national odes of the third book has been ascribed by some to the same guidance. However, since the organization of the Odes is not entirely chronological, and their composition followed both books of &quot;Satires&quot; and the &quot;Epodes&quot;, this argument is plainly specious; but doubtless the milieu of Maecenas&#x27;s circle influenced the writing of the Roman Odes (III.1–6) and others such as the ode to Pollio, Motum ex Metello (II.1).

Maecenas endeavoured also to divert the less masculine genius of Propertius from harping continually on his love to themes of public interest, an effort which to some extent backfired in the ironic elegies of Book III. But if the motive of his patronage had been merely political, it never could have inspired the affection which it did in its recipients. The great charm of Maecenas in his relation to the men of genius who formed his circle was his simplicity, cordiality and sincerity. Although not particular in the choice of some of the associates of his pleasures, he admitted none but men of worth to his intimacy, and when once admitted they were treated like equals. Much of the wisdom of Maecenas probably lives in the &quot;Satires&quot; and &quot;Epistles&quot; of Horace. It has fallen to the lot of no other patron of literature to have his name associated with works of such lasting interest as the &quot;Georgics&quot; of Virgil, the first three books of Horace&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot;, and the first book of his &quot;Epistles.&quot;

Two poems in the &quot;Appendix Vergiliana&quot; are elegies to him. Virgil cannot have written them, as he died eleven years before Maecenas; they may have been written by Albinovanus Pedo.

==Works==
Maecenas also wrote literature himself in both prose and verse, which are now lost literary work. The some twenty fragments that remain show that he was less successful as an author than as a judge and patron of literature.
His prose works on various subjects – &quot;Prometheus&quot;, dialogues like &quot;Symposium&quot; (a banquet at which Virgil, Horace, and Messalla were present), &quot;De cultu suo&quot; (on his manner of life), and a poem &quot;In Octaviam&quot; (&quot;Against Octavia&quot;) of which the content is unclear – were ridiculed by Augustus, Seneca, and Quintilian for their strange style, the use of rare words and awkward transpositions.
According to Dio Cassius, Maecenas was also the inventor of a system of shorthand.

==Gardens of Maecenas==


Maecenas sited his famous gardens, the first gardens of the Hellenistic-Persian garden style in Rome, on the Esquiline Hill, atop the Servian Wall and its adjoining necropolis, near the gardens of Lamia. It contained terraces, libraries, and other aspects of Roman culture. Maecenas is said to have been the first to construct a swimming bath of hot water in Rome, which may have been in the gardens. The luxury of his gardens and villas incurred the displeasure of Seneca the Younger.
Though the approximate site is known, it is not easy to reconcile literary indications to determine the gardens&#x27; exact location, whether or not they lay on both sides of the Servian &quot;ager&quot; and both north and south of the porta Esquilina. Common graves of the archaic Esquiline necropolis have been found near the north-west corner of the modern Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, that is, outside the Esquiline gate of antiquity and north of the &quot;via Tiburtina vetus&quot;; most probably the &quot;horti Maecenatiani&quot; extended north from this gate and road on both sides of the &quot;ager&quot;. The &quot;Auditorium of Maecenas&quot;, a probable venue for dining and entertainment, may still be visited (upon reservation) on Largo Leopardi near Via Merulana.

The gardens became imperial property after Maecenas&#x27;s death, and Tiberius lived there after his return to Rome in 2 AD. Nero connected them with the Palatine Hill via his Domus Transitoria, and viewed the burning of that from the turris Maecenatiana. This turris was probably the &quot;molem propinquam nubibus arduis&quot; (&quot;the pile, among the clouds&quot;) mentioned by Horace.

Whether the &quot;horti Maecenatiani&quot; bought by Fronto actually were the former gardens of Maecenas is unknown, and the &quot;domus Frontoniana&quot; mentioned in the twelfth century by Magister Gregorius may also refer to the gardens of Maecenas.

==Legacy==
His name has become a byword in many languages for a well-connected and wealthy patron. For instance, John Dewey, in his lectures &quot;Art as Experience&quot;, said: &quot;Economic patronage by wealthy and powerful individuals has at many times played a part in the encouragement of artistic production. Probably many a savage tribe had its Maecenas.&quot; Maecenas is celebrated for this role in two poems, the &quot;Elegiae in Maecenatem&quot;, which were written after his death and collected in the &quot;Appendix Vergiliana&quot;.

In various languages, Maecenas&#x27; name has given rise to a word for private patronage, mainly cultural but sometimes wider, usually perceived as more altruistic than sponsorship. A verse of the Latin-language student song &quot;Gaudeamus igitur&quot; wishes longevity upon the charity of the students&#x27; benefactors (&quot;Maecenatum&quot;, genitive plural of &quot;Maecenas&quot;).

Phillis Wheatley, the 18th-century poet and the first African-American writer to publish a book, published a poem &quot;To Maecenas&quot; as the first poem in her 1773 book &quot;Poems on Various subjects, Religious and Moral&quot;.

In Poland and Western Ukraine, a lawyer would customarily be addressed with the honorific &quot;Pan Mecenas&quot;.

In F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, Maecenas is one of the three famous wealthy men, along with Midas and J. P. Morgan, whose secrets the novel&#x27;s narrator Nick Carraway hopes to find in the books he buys for his home library.

==In other media==
Maecenas is a supporting character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, in which he is presented as a level-headed and loyal lieutenant to Octavian; Enobarbus describes him as &#x27;half the heart of Caesar&#x27;. Maecenas was portrayed by Alex Wyndham in the second season of the 2005 HBO television series &quot;Rome&quot;. He was portrayed by Russell Barr in the made-for-TV movie &quot;&quot;. He is also featured in one episode of the second series of &quot;Plebs&quot; on ITV. In the 2021 TV series &quot;Domina&quot;, he was portrayed by Youssef Kerkour.

<text>Marcus Claudius Tacitus ( ; died June 276) was Roman emperor from 275 to 276. During his short reign he campaigned against the Goths and the Heruli, for which he received the title &quot;Gothicus Maximus&quot;.

==Early life==

His early life is largely unknown. An origin story which claimed Tacitus to be the heir of an old Umbrian family and one of the wealthiest men of the empire with a total wealth of 280 million sestertii circulated after his coronation. His faction distributed copies of the historian Publius Cornelius Tacitus&#x27; work, which was barely read at the time, perhaps contributing to its partial survival. Modern historiography rejects his alleged descent from the historian as a fabrication. It is more likely that he emerged from the Illyrian military, which made him a representative of the army in imperial politics.

In the course of his long life he held various civil offices, including the consulship twice, once under Valerian and again in 273, earning universal respect.

==Emperor==
After the assassination of Aurelian, the army, apparently showing remorse towards its role in the death of the beloved emperor, relinquished the right of choosing his successor to the Senate. After a few weeks, the throne was offered to the aged &quot;Princeps Senatus&quot;, Tacitus.

According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, Tacitus, after ascertaining the sincerity of the Senate&#x27;s regard for him, accepted their nomination on 25 September 275, and the choice was cordially ratified by the army. If true, Tacitus would have been the last emperor elected by the Senate. However, it&#x27;s possible that much of this narrative is fictitious, as Zosimus and Zonaras report that Tacitus was actually proclaimed by the army without any intervention of the Senate. His proclamation as emperor should have happened in late November or early December.

In older historiography, it was generally accepted that Aurelian&#x27;s wife, Ulpia Severina, ruled in her own right before the election of Tacitus which could indicate an interregnum which lasted as long as six months. Contemporary bibliography considers that no interregnum may have existed between Aurelian&#x27;s death and the coronation of the new Emperor. Tacitus had been living in Campania before his election, and returned only reluctantly to the assembly of the Senate in Rome, where he was elected. He immediately asked the Senators to deify Aurelian, before arresting and executing Aurelian&#x27;s murderers. In ancient sources, he was described as very old at that time, but in reality he was possibly in his fifties.

Amongst the highest concerns of the new reign was the restoration of the ancient Senatorial powers. He granted substantial prerogatives to the Senate, securing to them by law the appointment of the emperor, of the consuls, and the provincial governors, as well as supreme right of appeal from every court in the empire in its judicial function, and the direction of certain branches of the revenue in its long-abeyant administrative capacity. Probus respected these changes, but after the reforms of Diocletian in the succeeding decades not a vestige would be left of them.

===Fighting barbarians===
Next he moved against the barbarian mercenaries that had been gathered by Aurelian to supplement Roman forces for his Eastern campaign. These mercenaries had plundered several towns in the Eastern Roman provinces after Aurelian had been murdered and the campaign cancelled. His half-brother, the Praetorian Prefect Florian, and Tacitus himself won a victory against these tribes, among which were the Heruli, gaining the emperor the title &quot;Gothicus Maximus&quot;.

===Death===
On his way back to the west to deal with a Frankish and Alamannic invasion of Gaul, according to Aurelius Victor, Eutropius and the Historia Augusta, Tacitus died of fever at Tyana in Cappadocia around June 276, after a rule of just over 6 months. In a contrary account, Zosimus claims he was assassinated, after appointing one of his relatives to an important command in Syria.

<text>MV &quot;Tampa&quot; was a roll-on/roll-off container ship completed in 1984 by Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. in South Korea for the Norway-based firm, Wilhelmsen Lines Shipowning.

In 2001, the vessel was at the centre of the Tampa affair when its crew rescued 433 refugees in international waters, but the Australian government refused permission for them to disembark on Christmas Island.

==Service history==
Tampa was launched in late 1983. It was a so-called ro-ro ship. Ro-ro is an abbreviation of roll-on/roll off. These ships are cargo ships designed to carry wheeled cargo, such as cars, motorcycles, trucks, semi-trailer trucks, buses, trailers, and railroad cars, that are driven on and off the ship on their own wheels or using a platform vehicle, such as a self-propelled modular transporter. This is in contrast to lift-on/lift-off (LoLo) vessels, which use a crane to load and unload cargo.

===Tampa affair===
In August 2001, under Captain Arne Rinnan, a diplomatic dispute brewed between Australia, Norway, and Indonesia after &quot;Tampa&quot; rescued 433 Afghans from a distressed fishing vessel in international waters. The Afghans wanted passage to the nearby Christmas Island. The Australian government sought to prevent this by refusing &quot;Tampa&quot; entry into Australian waters, insisting on their disembarkment elsewhere, and deploying the Special Air Service Regiment to board the ship.

At the time of the incident, &quot;Tampa&quot; carried cargo worth , and 27 crew. The crew of &quot;Tampa&quot; later received the Nansen Refugee Award for 2002 from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for their efforts to follow international principles of saving people in distress at sea.

===Cocaine smuggling bust===
In October 2006, &quot;Tampa&quot; was one of two Wilhelmsen ships involved in a cocaine-smuggling operation intercepted by the New Zealand Customs Service and the Australian Federal Police. of cocaine was allegedly attached to the side of the two cargo ships bound for Australia in purpose-built metal pods, although New Zealand authorities stated they did not believe the ship&#x27;s crew or owners were involved.

<doc id="19823" wikidata="Q335109" url="?curid=19823" title="Maya numerals">
<text>The Mayan numeral system was the system to represent numbers and calendar dates in the Maya civilization. It was a vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system. The numerals are made up of three symbols: zero (a shell), one (a dot) and five (a bar). For example, thirteen is written as three dots in a horizontal row above two horizontal bars; sometimes it is also written as three vertical dots to the left of two vertical bars. With these three symbols, each of the twenty vigesimal digits could be written.

Numbers after 19 were written vertically in powers of twenty. The Mayan used powers of twenty, just as the Hindu–Arabic numeral system uses powers of ten.

For example, thirty-three would be written as one dot, above three dots atop two bars. The first dot represents &quot;one twenty&quot; or &quot;1×20&quot;, which is added to three dots and two bars, or thirteen. Therefore, (1×20) + 13 = 33.

Upon reaching 202 or 400, another row is started (203 or 8000, then 204 or 160,000, and so on). The number 429 would be written as one dot above one dot above four dots and a bar, or (1×202) + (1×201) + 9 = 429.
:

Other than the bar and dot notation, Maya numerals were sometimes illustrated by face type glyphs or pictures. The face glyph for a number represents the deity associated with the number. These face number glyphs were rarely used, and are mostly seen on some of the most elaborate monumental carvings.

There are different representations of zero in the Dresden Codex, as can be seen at page 43b (which is concerned with the synodic cycle of Mars). It has been suggested that these pointed, oblong &quot;bread&quot; representations are calligraphic variants of the PET logogram, approximately meaning &quot;circular&quot; or &quot;rounded&quot;, and perhaps the basis of a derived noun meaning &quot;totality&quot; or &quot;grouping&quot;, such that the representations may be an appropriate marker for a number position which has reached its totality.

== Addition and subtraction ==
Adding and subtracting numbers below 20 using Mayan numerals is very simple.
Addition is performed by combining the numeric symbols at each level:&lt;br&gt;
If five or more dots result from the combination, five dots are removed and replaced by a bar. If four or more bars result, four bars are removed and a dot is added to the next higher row. This also means that the value of 1 bar is 5.

Similarly with subtraction, remove the elements of the subtrahend Symbol from the minuend symbol:&lt;br&gt;
If there are not enough dots in a minuend position, a bar is replaced by five dots. If there are not enough bars, a dot is removed from the next higher minuend symbol in the column and four bars are added to the minuend symbol which is being worked on.

== Modified vigesimal system in the Maya calendar ==
 The &quot;Long Count&quot; portion of the Maya calendar uses a variation on the strictly vigesimal numerals to show a Long Count date. In the second position, only the digits up to 17 are used, and the place value of the third position is not 20×20 = 400, as would otherwise be expected, but 18×20 = 360 so that one dot over two zeros signifies 360. Presumably, this is because 360 is roughly the number of days in a year. (The Maya had however a quite accurate estimation of 365.2422 days for the solar year at least since the early Classic era.) Subsequent positions use all twenty digits and the place values continue as 18×20×20 = 7,200 and 18×20×20×20 = 144,000, etc.

Every known example of large numbers in the Maya system uses this &#x27;modified vigesimal&#x27; system, with the third position representing multiples of 18×20. It is reasonable to assume, but not proven by any evidence, that the normal system in use was a pure base-20 system.

== Origins ==
Several Mesoamerican cultures used similar numerals and base-twenty systems and the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar requiring the use of zero as a place-holder. The earliest long count date (on Stela 2 at Chiappa de Corzo, Chiapas) is from 36 BC.

Since the eight earliest Long Count dates appear outside the Maya homeland, it is assumed that the use of zero and the Long Count calendar predated the Maya, and was possibly the invention of the Olmec. Indeed, many of the earliest Long Count dates were found within the Olmec heartland. However, the Olmec civilization had come to an end by the 4th century BC, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count dates—which suggests that zero was &quot;not&quot; an Olmec discovery.

<doc id="19826" wikidata="Q332419" url="?curid=19826" title="Michael Foot">
<text>Michael Mackintosh Foot (23 July 19133 March 2010) was a British politician who was Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition from 1980 to 1983. Foot began his career as a journalist on &quot;Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. He co-wrote the 1940 polemic against appeasement of Adolf Hitler, &quot;Guilty Men&quot;, under a pseudonym.

Foot was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1945 to 1955 and 1960 to 1992. A passionate orator, and associated with the left wing of the Labour Party for most of his career, Foot was an ardent supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and of British withdrawal from the European Economic Community (EEC). He was appointed to Harold Wilson&#x27;s Cabinet as Employment Secretary in 1974, and he later was Leader of the House of Commons from 1976 to 1979 under James Callaghan. He was also Deputy Leader of the Labour Party under Callaghan from 1976 to 1980.

Elected as a compromise candidate, Foot served as Labour leader and Leader of the Opposition from 1980 to 1983. Not particularly telegenic, he was nicknamed &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; for his rumpled appearance. A faction of the party broke away in 1981 to form the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Foot led Labour into the 1983 general election, when the party obtained its lowest share of the vote in 65 years and the fewest parliamentary seats since 1935, which remained the case until Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 2019 general election. He resigned the party leadership following the election, and was succeeded as party leader by Neil Kinnock.

==Family==
Foot was born in Lipson Terrace, Plymouth, Devon, the fourth son and fifth of seven children of Isaac Foot (1880–1960) and of the Scotswoman Eva (née Mackintosh, died 17 May 1946).
Isaac Foot was a solicitor and founder of the Plymouth law firm Foot and Bowden (which amalgamated with another firm to become Foot Anstey). Isaac Foot, an active member of the Liberal Party, served as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Bodmin in Cornwall from 1922 to 1924 and again from 1929 to 1935, and as a Lord Mayor of Plymouth.

Michael Foot&#x27;s siblings included: Sir Dingle Foot MP (1905–78), a Liberal and subsequently Labour MP; Hugh Foot, Baron Caradon (1907–90), Governor of Cyprus (1957–60) and representative of the United Kingdom at the United Nations from 1964 to 1970; Liberal politician John Foot, later Baron Foot (1909–99); Margaret Elizabeth Foot (1911–65); Jennifer Mackintosh Highet (1916–2002); and Christopher Isaac Foot (1917–84). Michael Foot was the uncle of campaigning journalist Paul Foot (1937–2004) and of charity worker Oliver Foot (1946–2008).

==Early life==
Foot was educated at Plymouth College Preparatory School, Forres School in Swanage, and Leighton Park School in Reading. When he left Forres School, the headmaster sent a letter to his father in which he said &quot;he has been the leading boy in the school in every way&quot;. He then went on to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Wadham College, Oxford. Foot was a president of the Oxford Union. He also took part in the ESU USA Tour (the debating tour of the United States run by the English-Speaking Union).

Upon graduating with a second-class degree in 1934, he took a job as a shipping clerk in Birkenhead. Foot was profoundly influenced by the poverty and unemployment that he witnessed in Liverpool, which was on a different scale from anything he had seen in Plymouth. A Liberal up to this time, Foot was converted to socialism by Oxford University Labour Club president David Lewis, a Canadian Rhodes scholar, and others: &quot;I knew him [at Oxford] when I was a Liberal [and Lewis] played a part in converting me to socialism.&quot;

Foot joined the Labour Party and first stood for parliament, aged 22, at the 1935 general election, where he contested Monmouth. During the election, Foot criticised the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, for seeking rearmament. In his election address, Foot contended that &quot;the armaments race in Europe must be stopped now&quot;. Foot also supported unilateral disarmament, after multilateral disarmament talks at Geneva had broken down in 1933.

Foot became a journalist, working briefly on the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, before joining the left-wing weekly &quot;Tribune&quot; when it was set up in early 1937 to support the Unity Campaign, an attempt to secure an anti-fascist united front between Labour and other left-wing parties. The campaign&#x27;s members were Stafford Cripps&#x27;s (Labour-affiliated) Socialist League, the Independent Labour Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain (CP). Foot resigned in 1938 after the paper&#x27;s first editor, William Mellor, was sacked for refusing to adopt a new CP policy of backing a Popular Front, including non-socialist parties, against fascism and appeasement. In a 1955 interview, Foot ideologically identified as a libertarian socialist.

He was an avid anti-imperialist and was heavily involved in the India League. As an Oxford graduate, he was influenced by the founder of the India League, Krishna Menon. The India League was the premier UK-based organisation that fought for the &#x27;Liberation of India&#x27;. After Indian independence in 1947, Foot&#x27;s interest in India continued, and he became Chair of the India League.

==Journalism==
On the recommendation of Aneurin Bevan, Foot was soon hired by Lord Beaverbrook to work as a writer on his &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. (Bevan is supposed to have told Beaverbrook on the phone: &quot;I&#x27;ve got a young bloody knight-errant here. They sacked his boss, so he resigned. Have a look at him.&quot;) At the outbreak of the Second World War, Foot volunteered for military service, but was rejected because of his chronic asthma.

In 1940, under the pen-name &quot;Cato&quot; he and two other Beaverbrook journalists (Frank Owen, editor of the &quot;Standard&quot;, and Peter Howard of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;) published &quot;Guilty Men&quot;, which attacked the appeasement policy and slow pace of British re-armament under the National Governments of Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin, and Neville Chamberlain; it became a runaway bestseller. (In so doing, Foot reversed his position of the 1935 election – when he had attacked the Conservatives as militaristic and demanded disarmament in the face of Nazi Germany.) Beaverbrook made Foot editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in 1942, when he was aged 28. During the war, Foot made a speech that was later featured in the documentary TV series &quot;The World at War&quot; broadcast in February 1974. Foot was speaking in defence of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, which had criticised the conduct of the war by the Churchill government. He mocked the notion that the Government would make no more territorial demands of other newspapers if they allowed the &quot;Mirror&quot; to be censored.

Foot left the &quot;Standard&quot; in 1945 to join the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; as a columnist. The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; was jointly owned by the Trades Union Congress and Odhams Press, and was effectively an official Labour Party paper. He rejoined &quot;Tribune&quot; as editor from 1948 to 1952, and was again the paper&#x27;s editor from 1955 to 1960. Throughout his political career he railed against the increasing corporate domination of the press.

==Member of Parliament==

Foot fought the Plymouth Devonport constituency in the 1945 general election. His election agent was Labour activist and lifelong friend Ron Lemin. He won the seat for Labour for the first time, holding it until his surprise defeat by Dame Joan Vickers at the 1955 general election. Until 1957, he was the most prominent ally of Aneurin Bevan, who had taken Cripps&#x27;s place as leader of the Labour left. He successfully urged Bevan to follow through with his threat to resign from the Cabinet in protest of the introduction of prescription charges at the National Health Service, leading to a split in the Labour Party between Bevanites and Gaitskellites. Foot and Bevan fell out after Bevan renounced unilateral nuclear disarmament at the 1957 Labour Party conference.

Before the Cold War began in the late 1940s, Foot favoured a &#x27;third way&#x27; foreign policy for Europe (he was joint author with Richard Crossman and Ian Mikardo of the pamphlet &quot;Keep Left&quot; in 1947), but in the wake of the communist seizure of power in Hungary and Czechoslovakia he and &quot;Tribune&quot; took a strongly anti-communist position, eventually embracing NATO.

Foot was, however, a critic of the West&#x27;s handling of the Korean War, an opponent of West German rearmament in the early 1950s and a founder member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in 1957. Under his editorship, &quot;Tribune&quot; opposed both the British government&#x27;s Suez campaign and the Soviet crushing of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956. During this period, he made regular television appearances on the current-affairs programmes &quot;In The News&quot; (BBC Television) and subsequently &quot;Free Speech&quot; (ITV). &quot;There was certainly nothing wrong with his television technique in those days,&quot; reflected Anthony Howard shortly after Foot&#x27;s death. Foot joined the &quot;Who Killed Kennedy Committee?&quot; set up by Bertrand Russell in 1964.

Foot returned to parliament at a by-election in Ebbw Vale, Monmouthshire, in 1960, the seat having been left vacant by Bevan&#x27;s death. He had the Labour whip withdrawn in March 1961 after rebelling against the Labour leadership over Royal Air Force estimates. He only returned to the Parliamentary Labour Group in 1963, when Harold Wilson became Leader of the Labour Party after the sudden death of Hugh Gaitskell.

Harold Wilson — the subject of an enthusiastic campaign biography by Foot published by Robert Maxwell&#x27;s Pergamon Press in 1964 – offered Foot a place in his first government, but Foot turned it down, instead becoming the leader of Labour&#x27;s left opposition from the back benches. He opposed the government&#x27;s moves to restrict immigration, join the European Communities (or &quot;Common Market&quot; as they were referred to) and reform the trade unions, was against the Vietnam War and Rhodesia&#x27;s unilateral declaration of independence, and denounced the Soviet suppression of &quot;socialism with a human face&quot; in Czechoslovakia in 1968. He also famously allied with the Tory right-winger Enoch Powell to scupper the government&#x27;s plan to abolish the voting rights of hereditary peers and create a House of Lords comprising only life peers – a &quot;seraglio of eunuchs&quot; as Foot put it.

Foot challenged James Callaghan for the post of Treasurer of the Labour Party in 1967, but failed.

===In government===
After 1970, Labour moved to the left and Wilson came to an accommodation with Foot. Foot served in the Second Shadow Cabinet of Harold Wilson in various roles between 1970 and 1974. In April 1972, he stood for the Deputy Leadership of the party, along with Edward Short and Anthony Crosland. The first ballot saw Foot narrowly come second to Short winning 110 votes to the latter&#x27;s 111. Crosland polled 61 votes and was eliminated. It was reported in the next day&#x27;s &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; that Short was the favourite to pick up most of Crosland&#x27;s votes. The second ballot saw Short increase his total to 145 votes, while Foot&#x27;s only rose to 116, giving Short victory by 29 votes.

When, in 1974, Labour returned to office under Wilson, Foot became Secretary of State for Employment. According to Ben Pimlott, his appointment was intended to please the left of the party and the Trade Unions. In this role, he played the major part in the government&#x27;s efforts to maintain the trade unions&#x27; support. He was also responsible for the Health and Safety at Work Act, as well as the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act that repealed the Heath ministry&#x27;s trade union reforms, and the Employment Protection Act, which introduced legal protections against being sacked for becoming pregnant and legislated for maternity pay. His time as Employment Secretary also saw Acas adopt its current name and modern form as a body with independence from government.

Foot was one of the mainstays of the &quot;no&quot; campaign in the 1975 referendum on British membership of the European Communities. When Wilson retired in 1976, Foot contested the party leadership and led in the first ballot, but was ultimately defeated by James Callaghan. Later that year Foot was elected Deputy Leader, and during the Callaghan government Foot took a seat in Cabinet as Leader of the House of Commons, which gave him the unenviable task of trying to maintain the survival of the Callaghan government as its majority evaporated. However, he was able to steer numerous government proposals through the Commons, often by very narrow majorities, including increases in pension and benefit rates, the creation of the Police Complaints Board, the expansion of comprehensive schools, the establishment of a statutory responsibility to provide housing for the homeless, universal Child Benefit, the nationalisation of shipbuilding, abolishing pay beds in NHS hospitals, and housing security for agricultural workers, before the government fell in a vote of no confidence by a single vote. Whilst Leader of the Commons, Foot simultaneously held the post of Lord President of the Council.

In 1975, Foot, along with Jennie Lee and others, courted controversy when they supported Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, after she prompted the declaration of a state of emergency. In December 1975, &quot;The Times&quot; ran an editorial titled &#x27;Is Mr Foot a Fascist?&#x27; — their answer was that he was — after Norman Tebbit accused him of &#x27;undiluted fascism&#x27; when Foot said that the Ferrybridge Six deserved dismissal for defying a closed shop.

==Labour leadership==

Following Labour&#x27;s 1979 general election defeat by Margaret Thatcher, James Callaghan remained as party leader for the next 18 months before he resigned. Foot was elected Labour leader on 10 November 1980, beating Denis Healey in the second round of the leadership election (the last leadership contest to involve only Labour MPs). Foot presented himself as a compromise candidate, capable – unlike Healey – of uniting the party, which at the time was riven by the grassroots left-wing insurgency centred around Tony Benn.

The Bennites were demanding revenge for what they considered to be the betrayals of the Callaghan government. They called for MPs who had acquiesced in Callaghan&#x27;s policies to be replaced by left-wingers who would support unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Communities, and widespread nationalisation. Benn did not stand for the leadership; apart from Foot and Healey, the other candidates (both eliminated in the first round) were John Silkin, a Tribunite like Foot, and Peter Shore, a Eurosceptic.

In 1980, Healey was widely expected by the media and many political figures to be the next Labour leader. However, Steve Richards notes that while &quot;Healey was widely seen as the obvious successor to Callaghan&quot;, and that sections of the media ultimately reacted with &quot;disbelief&quot; at Labour not choosing him, the &quot;choice of Foot was not as perverse as it seemed&quot;. He argues Labour MPs were looking for a figure from the left who could unite the wider party with the leadership, which Healey could not do. Richards states that despite being on the left of the party, Foot was not a &quot;tribal politician&quot; and had proved he could work with those of different ideologies and had been a loyal deputy to Callaghan. Thus Foot &quot;was seen as the unity candidate&quot; and won the election.

When he became leader, Foot was already 67 years old and frail. Following the 1979 energy crisis, Britain went into recession in 1980, which was blamed on the Conservative government&#x27;s controversial monetarist policy against inflation, which had the effect of increasing unemployment. As a result, Labour had moved ahead of the Conservatives in the opinion polls. Following Foot&#x27;s election as leader, opinion polls showed a double-digit lead for Labour, boosting his hopes of becoming prime minister at the next general election, which had to be held by May 1984.

When Foot became leader, the Conservative politician Kenneth Baker commented: &quot;Labour was led by Dixon of Dock Green under Jim Callaghan. Now it is led by Worzel Gummidge.&quot; Foot&#x27;s nickname in the press gradually became &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot;, or &quot;Worzel&quot;. This became particularly common after Remembrance Day 1981, when he attended the Cenotaph observance wearing a coat that some said resembled a donkey jacket. After his tenure as leader, Foot would be &quot;depicted as a scarecrow on ITV&#x27;s satirical puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;.&quot;

Almost immediately following his election as leader, he was faced with a serious crisis. On 25 January 1981, four senior politicians on the right-wing of the Labour Party (Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, David Owen and William Rodgers, the so-called &quot;Gang of Four&quot;) left Labour and formed the Social Democratic Party, which was launched on 26 March 1981. This was largely seen as the consequence of the Labour Party&#x27;s swing to the left, polarising divisions in an already divided party.

The SDP won the support of large sections of the British media. For most of 1981 and early 1982, its opinion poll ratings suggested that the SDP could at least overtake Labour and possibly win a general election. The Conservatives were then unpopular because of the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher, which had seen unemployment reach a postwar high.

The Labour left was still strong. In 1981, Benn decided to challenge Healey for the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party, a contest Healey won, albeit narrowly. Foot struggled to make an impact, and was widely criticised for his ineffectiveness, though his performances in the Commons – most notably on the Falklands War of 1982 – won him widespread respect from other parliamentarians. He was criticised by some on the left for supporting Thatcher&#x27;s immediate resort to military action. The right-wing newspapers nevertheless lambasted him consistently for what they saw as his bohemian eccentricity, attacking him for wearing what they described as a &quot;donkey jacket&quot; (actually he wore a type of duffel coat) at the wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Day in November 1981, for which he was likened to an &quot;out-of-work navvy&quot; by a fellow Labour MP. Foot later said that the Queen Mother had described it as a &quot;sensible coat for a day like this&quot;. He later donated the coat to the People&#x27;s History Museum in Manchester, which holds a collection that spans Foot&#x27;s entire political career from 1938 to 1990, and his personal papers dating back to 1926.

The formation of the SDP – which formed an alliance with the Liberal Party in June 1981 – contributed to a fall in Labour support. The double-digit lead that had still been intact in opinion polls at the start of 1981 was swiftly wiped out, and by the end of October the opinion polls were showing the Alliance ahead of Labour. Labour briefly regained their lead of most opinion polls in early 1982, but when the Falklands conflict ended on 14 June 1982 with a British victory over Argentina, opinion polls showed the Conservatives firmly in the lead. Their position at the top of the polls was strengthened by the return to economic growth later in the year. It was looking certain that the Conservatives would be re-elected, and the only key issue that the media were still speculating by the end of 1982 was whether it would be Labour or the Alliance who formed the next opposition.

Through late 1982 and early 1983, there was constant speculation that Labour MPs would replace Foot with Healey as leader. Such speculation increased after Labour lost the 1983 Bermondsey by-election, in which Peter Tatchell was Labour candidate, standing against a Conservative, a Liberal (eventual winner Simon Hughes) and John O&#x27;Grady, who had declared himself the Real Bermondsey Labour candidate. Critically, Labour held on in a subsequent by-election in Darlington, and Foot remained leader for the 1983 general election.

==1983 general election==

The 1983 Labour manifesto, strongly socialist in tone, advocated unilateral nuclear disarmament, higher personal taxation and a return to a more interventionist industrial policy. The manifesto also pledged that a Labour government would abolish the House of Lords, nationalise banks and immediately withdraw from the then-European Economic Community. Gerald Kaufman, once Harold Wilson&#x27;s press officer and during the 1980s a prominent figure on the Labour right-wing, described the 1983 Labour manifesto as &quot;the longest suicide note in history.&quot;

As a statement on internal democracy, Foot passed the edict that the manifesto would consist of all resolutions arrived at conference. The party also failed to master the medium of television, while Foot addressed public meetings around the country, and made some radio broadcasts, in the same manner as Clement Attlee did in 1945.

The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; was the only major newspaper to back Foot and the Labour Party at the 1983 general election, urging its readers to vote Labour and &quot;Stop the waste of our nation, for your job your children and your future&quot; in response to the mass unemployment that followed Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s monetarist economic policies to reduce inflation. Most other newspapers urged their readers to vote Conservative.

The Labour Party, led by Foot, lost to the Conservatives in a landslide – a result that had been widely predicted by the opinion polls since the previous summer. The only consolation for Foot and Labour was that they did not lose their place in opposition to the SDP–Liberal Alliance, who came close to them in terms of votes but were still a long way behind in terms of seats. Foot was very critical of the Alliance, accusing them of &quot;siphoning&quot; Labour support and enabling the Tories to win more seats.

Foot resigned days following the bitter election defeat, and was succeeded as leader on 2 October by Neil Kinnock; who had been tipped from the outset to be Labour&#x27;s choice of new leader.

==Backbenches and retirement==
Foot took a back seat in Labour politics following 1983 and retired from the House of Commons at the 1992 general election, when Labour lost to the Conservative Party (led by John Major) for the fourth election in succession, but remained politically active. From 1987 to 1992, he was the oldest sitting British MP (preceding former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath). He defended Salman Rushdie, after Ayatollah Khomeini advocated killing the novelist in a fatwā, and took a strongly pro-interventionist position against Serbia and Montenegro during the Yugoslav Wars, supporting NATO forces whilst citing defence of civilian populations in Croatia and Bosnia. In addition, he was among the Patrons of the British-Croatian Society. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s political editor Michael White criticised Foot&#x27;s &quot;overgenerous&quot; support for Croatian President Franjo Tuđman.

Foot remained a high-profile member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). He wrote several books, including highly regarded biographies of Aneurin Bevan and H. G. Wells, and was a vice-president of the H. G. Wells Society.

Foot was an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association. In 1988, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. 

In a poll of Labour Party activists in 2008, he was voted the worst post-war Labour Party leader. Though Foot is considered by many right-wingers to be a failure as Labour leader, his biographer Mervyn Jones strongly makes the case that no one else could have held Labour together at the time, particularly in the face of the controversy over the infiltration of the party by Militant.

===Gordievsky&#x27;s KGB allegations===
Oleg Gordievsky, a high-ranking KGB officer who defected from the Soviet Union to the UK in 1985, made allegations against Foot in his 1995 memoirs. Essentially, the allegations claimed that, up until 1968, Foot had spoken to KGB agents &quot;dozens of times&quot;, passing information about politics and the trade unions, and Foot had been paid a total of around £1,500 for his information (said to be worth £37,000 in 2018). &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, which serialised Gordievsky&#x27;s book under the headline &quot;KGB: Michael Foot was our agent&quot;, stated in an article of 19 February that the Soviet intelligence services regarded Foot as an &quot;agent of influence&quot; (and a &quot;useful idiot&quot;), codenamed &quot;Agent BOOT&quot;, and that he was in the pay of the KGB for many years. Crucially, the newspaper used material from the original manuscript of the book that mentioned Foot by name, something excluded from the published book.

At the time a leading article in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper asserted: &quot;It seems extraordinary that such an unreliable figure should now be allowed, given the lack of supporting evidence, to damage the reputation of figures such as Mr Foot.&quot; In a February 1992 interview, Gordievsky declared that he had no further revelations to make about the Labour Party. Foot successfully sued the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, winning &quot;substantial&quot; damages.

Following Foot&#x27;s death, Charles Moore writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2010 gave an account that he said had been provided to him by Gordievsky, containing additional uncorroborated information concerning his allegations. Moore said there was no evidence to show that Foot gave away state secrets.

== Plymouth Argyle ==
Foot was a passionate supporter of Plymouth Argyle Football Club from his childhood and once remarked that he was not going to die until he had seen them play in the Premier League.
He served for several years as a director of the club, seeing two promotions under his tenure.

For his 90th birthday, Foot was registered with the Football League as an honorary player and given the shirt number 90. This made him the oldest registered professional player in the history of football.

== Personal life ==

Foot was married to the film-maker, author and feminist historian Jill Craigie (1911–1999) from 1949 until her death fifty years later. He had no children.

In February 2007, it was revealed that Foot had an extramarital affair with a woman around 35 years his junior in the early 1970s. The affair, which lasted nearly a year, put a considerable strain on his marriage. The affair is detailed in Foot&#x27;s official biography, published in March 2007.

On 23 July 2006, his 93rd birthday, Michael Foot became the longest-lived leader of a major British political party, passing Lord Callaghan&#x27;s record of 92 years, 364 days.

A staunch republican (though well liked by the Royal Family on a personal level), Foot rejected honours from the Queen and the government, including a knighthood and a peerage, on more than one occasion.

He was also an atheist. , he was one of four leaders of the Labour Party to declare that they did not follow any religion.

== Health ==

Foot suffered from asthma (which disqualified him from service in the Second World War) and eczema.

In October 1963, he was involved in a car crash, suffering pierced lungs, broken ribs, and a broken left leg. Foot used a walking stick for the rest of his life. According to former MP Tam Dalyell, Foot had, up until the accident, been a chain-smoker, but he gave up the habit thereafter. Jill Craigie also suffered a crushed hand in this car crash.

In October 1976, Foot became blind in one eye following an attack of shingles.

==Death==
Foot died at his Hampstead, north London home on the morning of 3 March 2010 at the age of 96 from congestive heart failure. The House of Commons was informed of the news later that day by Justice Secretary Jack Straw, who told the House: &quot;I am sure that this news will be received with great sadness not only in my own party but across the country as a whole.&quot; Foot&#x27;s funeral was a non-religious service, held on 15 March 2010 at Golders Green Crematorium in North-West London.

== In popular culture ==
=== &quot;Foot Heads Arms Body&quot; ===
On 22 June 1978, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ran an article with the headline &quot;Foot hits back on Nazi comparison&quot;. Reader David C. Allan of Edinburgh responded with a letter to the editor, which the paper ran on 27 June. Decrying the headline&#x27;s apparent pun, Allan suggested that, if Foot were in future to be appointed Secretary of State for Defence, &quot;The Guardian&quot; might cover it under the headline &quot;Foot Heads Arms Body&quot;. 

The belief later gained currency that &quot;The Times&quot; actually had run the headline. Some decades later, Martyn Cornell recalled the story as true, saying he had written the headline himself as a &quot;Times&quot; subeditor around 1986. The headline does not, however, appear in The Times Digital Archive, which includes every day&#x27;s newspaper from 1785 into the 21st century. 

In 2018, John Rentoul included this headline in his &quot;The Top 10: Headlines&quot;, subtitled &quot;Clever and memorable plays on words that have made journalistic history&quot;.

=== Fictional portrayals ===
Foot was portrayed by Patrick Godfrey in the 2002 BBC production of Ian Curteis&#x27;s long unproduced &quot;The Falklands Play&quot; and by Michael Pennington in the film &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;.

<text>Max and Moritz: A Story of Seven Boyish Pranks (original: &quot;Max und Moritz – Eine Bubengeschichte in sieben Streichen&quot;) is a German language illustrated story in verse. It was written and illustrated by Wilhelm Busch and published in 1865, and has since had significant cultural impact, both in German-speaking countries, where the story has been passed down through generations, but on the wider world, after translation into many languages. It has been adapted for film and television, as well as inspiring comic strips and children&#x27;s TV characters.
==Description==
&quot;Max and Moritz: A Story of Seven Boyish Pranks&quot; is an inventive, blackly humorous tale, told entirely in rhymed couplets, about two boys who play pranks. It was written and illustrated by Wilhelm Busch and published in 1865. It is among the early works of Busch, yet it already featured many substantial, effectually aesthetic and formal regularities, procedures and basic patterns of Busch&#x27;s later works. 

Many familiar with comic strip history consider it to have been the direct inspiration for the &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot; and &quot;Quick &amp; Flupke&quot;. The German title satirises the German custom of giving a subtitle to the name of dramas in the form of &quot;Ein Drama in ... Akten&quot; (&quot;A Drama in ... Acts&quot;), which became dictum in colloquial usage for any event with an unpleasant or dramatic course, such as &quot;Bundespräsidentenwahl - Ein Drama in drei Akten&quot; (&quot;Federal Presidential Elections - A drama in three acts&quot;).
=== The pranks ===
There have been several English translations of the original German verses over the years, but all have maintained the original trochaic tetrameter:

==== Preface ====
Ah, how oft we read or hear of &lt;br&gt;
Boys we almost stand in fear of!&lt;br&gt;
For example, take these stories&lt;br&gt;
Of two youths, named Max and Moritz,&lt;br&gt;
Who, instead of early turning&lt;br&gt;
Their young minds to useful learning,&lt;br&gt;
Often leered with horrid features&lt;br&gt;
At their lessons and their teachers.
Look now at the empty head: he&lt;br&gt;
Is for mischief always ready.&lt;br&gt;
Teasing creatures - climbing fences,&lt;br&gt;
Stealing apples, pears, and quinces,&lt;br&gt;
Is, of course, a deal more pleasant,&lt;br&gt;
And far easier for the present,&lt;br&gt;
Than to sit in schools or churches,&lt;br&gt;
Fixed like roosters on their perches

But O dear, O dear, O deary,&lt;br&gt;
When the end comes sad and dreary!&lt;br&gt;
&#x27;Tis a dreadful thing to tell&lt;br&gt;
That on Max and Moritz fell!&lt;br&gt;
All they did this book rehearses,&lt;br&gt;
Both in pictures and in verses.

==== First Trick: The Widow ====
The boys tie several crusts of bread together with thread, and lay this trap in the chicken yard of Bolte (or &quot;Tibbets&quot; in the English version), an old widow, causing all the chickens to become fatally entangled.

This prank is remarkably similar to the eighth history of the classic German prankster tales of Till Eulenspiegel.

==== Second Trick: The Widow II ====
As the widow cooks her chickens, the boys sneak onto her roof. When she leaves her kitchen momentarily, the boys steal the chickens using a fishing pole down the chimney. The widow hears her dog barking and hurries upstairs, finds the hearth empty and beats the dog.

==== Third Trick: The Tailor ====

The boys torment Böck (or &quot;Buck&quot; in the English version), a well-liked tailor who has a fast stream flowing in front of his house. They saw through the planks of his wooden bridgelet, making a precarious gap, then taunt him by making goat noises (a pun on his name being similar to the zoological expression &#x27;buck&#x27;; in the English version, they use his name for a straight pun), until he runs outside. The bridge breaks; the tailor is swept away and nearly drowns (but for two geese, which he grabs a hold of and which fly high to safety).

Although Till removes the planks of the bridge instead of sawing them, there are some similarities to Till Eulenspiegel (32nd History).

==== Fourth Trick: The Teacher ====

While their devout teacher, Lämpel, is busy at church, the boys invade his home and fill his favorite pipe with gunpowder. When he lights the pipe, the blast knocks him unconscious, blackens his skin and burns away all his hair. But: &quot;Time that comes will quick repair; yet the pipe retains its share.&quot;

==== Fifth Trick: The Uncle ====

The boys collect bags full of May bugs, which they promptly deposit in their Uncle Fritz&#x27;s bed. Uncle is nearly asleep when he feels the bugs walking on his nose. Horrified, he goes into a frenzy, killing them all before going back to sleep.

==== Sixth Trick: The Baker ====

The boys invade a closed bakery to steal some Easter sweets. Attempting to steal pretzels, they fall into a vat of dough. The baker returns, catches the breaded pair, and bakes them. But they survive, and escape by gnawing through their crusts.

==== Final Trick: The Farmer ====

Hiding out in the grain storage area of a farmer, Mecke (unnamed in the English version), the boys slit some grain sacks. Carrying away one of the sacks, farmer Mecke immediately notices the problem. He puts the boys in the sack instead, then takes it to the mill. The boys are ground to bits and devoured by the miller&#x27;s ducks. Later, no one expresses regret.

== Legacy and cultural significance==
Busch&#x27;s classic tale of the terrible duo (now in the public domain) has since become a proud part of the culture in German-speaking countries. Even today, parents usually read these tales to their not-yet-literate children. To this day in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, a certain familiarity with the story and its rhymes is still presumed, as it is often referenced in mass communication. The two leering faces are synonymous with mischief, and appear almost logo-like in advertising and even graffiti.

&quot;Max and Moritz&quot; is the first published original foreign children&#x27;s book in Japan, translated into rōmaji by Shinjirō Shibutani and Kaname Oyaizu in 1887 as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Naughty stories&quot;).

During World War I, the Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen, named his dog Moritz, giving the name Max to another animal given to his friend.

The two Sturer Emil vehicles produced in World War II were named Max and Moritz by their crews. 

After World War II, German-U.S. composer Richard Mohaupt, together with choreographer , created , a burlesque dance (), which premiered at Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe on 18 December 1949.

The Max and Moritz story inspired Rudolph Dirks to create The Katzenjammer Kids, which would in turn serve as inspiration for Art Clokey to create his antagonists for Gumby, the Blockheads. 

&quot;Max and Moritz&quot; (along with &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;) may have served as inspiration for Ragdoll Productions&#x27; British children&#x27;s show &quot;Rosie and Jim&quot;, Mike Judge&#x27;s animated series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, Terrence and Phillip of the Terrence and Phillip Show from &quot;South Park&quot; (the show&#x27;s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, having said South Park was inspired by &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;), and George Beard and Harold Hutchins in the &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; series by Dav Pilkey.

The Max &amp; Moritz Prize is an award for comic books, comic strips, and other similar materials, awarded at each of the biennial International Comics Shows of Erlangen since 1984.

&quot;Der Fall Max und Moritz&quot; (), by Jörg M. Günther, published in 1988, is a satirical treatment in which the various misdeeds in the story – both by the protagonists and their surroundings – are analysed via the regulations of the German Strafgesetzbuch.

In the early 2020s, the Efteling amusement park in the Netherlands opened a pair of rollercoasters named Max &amp; Moritz.

Max and Moritz are featured in &quot;The Defeated&quot;, a streaming television series distributed by Netflix in 2021. Set in 1946, in post-war Berlin, the two main characters are brothers named &quot;Max&quot; and &quot;Moritz&quot;, and the book also features prominently throughout the series.

<text>May Day is a European festival of ancient origins marking the beginning of summer, usually celebrated on 1 May, around halfway between the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s Spring equinox and June solstice. Festivities may also be held the night before, known as May Eve. Traditions often include gathering wildflowers and green branches (&quot;bringing in the May&quot;), weaving floral garlands, crowning a May Queen (sometimes with a male companion), and setting up a Maypole, May Tree or May Bush, around which people dance and sing. Bonfires are also a major part of the festival in some regions. Regional varieties and related traditions include Walpurgis Night in central and northern Europe, the Gaelic festival Beltane, the Welsh festival Calan Mai, and May devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary. It has also been associated with the ancient Roman festival Floralia.

International Workers&#x27; Day observed on 1 May is also called &quot;May Day&quot;, but the two have different histories.

== Origins and celebrations ==
The earliest known May celebrations appeared with the &quot;Floralia&quot;, festival of Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers, held from 27 April to 3 May during the Roman Republic era, and the &quot;Maiouma&quot; or &quot;Maiuma&quot;, a festival celebrating Dionysus and Aphrodite held every three years during the month of May. The &quot;Floralia&quot; opened with theatrical performances. In the &quot;Floralia&quot;, Ovid says that hares and goats were released as part of the festivities. Persius writes that crowds were pelted with vetches, beans, and lupins. A ritual called the &quot;Florifertum&quot; was performed on either 27 April or 3 May, during which a bundle of wheat ears was carried into a shrine, though it is not clear if this devotion was made to Flora or Ceres. &quot;Floralia&quot; concluded with competitive events and spectacles, and a sacrifice to Flora.

&quot;Maiouma&quot; was celebrated at least as early as the 2nd century AD, when records show expenses for the month-long festival were appropriated by Emperor Commodus. According to the 6th-century chronicles of John Malalas, the &quot;Maiouma&quot; was a &quot;nocturnal dramatic festival, held every three years and known as Orgies, that is, the Mysteries of Dionysus and Aphrodite&quot; and that it was &quot;known as the &quot;Maioumas&quot; because it is celebrated in the month of May-Artemisios&quot;. During this time, enough money was set aside by the government for torches, lights, and other expenses to cover a 30-day festival of &quot;all-night revels.&quot; The &quot;Maiouma&quot; was celebrated with splendorous banquets and offerings. Its reputation for licentiousness caused it to be suppressed during the reign of Emperor Constantine, though a less debauched version of it was briefly restored during the reigns of Arcadius and Honorius, only to be suppressed again during the same period.

During the Middle Ages, May Eve was celebrated in much of northern Europe with the lighting of bonfires at night. In the Germanic countries, this became Walpurgis Night, commemorating the official canonization of Saint Walpurga on 1 May 870. It continued the tradition of lighting bonfires. Folklorist Jack Santino says &quot;Her day and its traditions almost certainly are traceable to pre-Christian celebrations that took place at this time&quot;. In Gaelic culture, 1 May was the celebration of &quot;Beltaine&quot; or &quot;Cétshamhain&quot;, while for the Welsh it was &quot;Calan Mai&quot; or &quot;Cyntefin&quot;. First attested in 900 AD, the celebration mainly focused on the symbolic use of fire to bless cattle and other livestock as they were moved to summer pastures. This custom continued into the early 19th century, during which time cattle would be made to jump over fires to protect their milk from being stolen by fairies. People would also leap over the fires for luck.

Since the 18th century, many Roman Catholics have observed May – and May Day – with various May devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In works of art, school skits, and so forth, Mary&#x27;s head will often be adorned with flowers in a May crowning. 1 May is also one of two feast days of the Catholic patron saint of workers St Joseph the Worker, a carpenter, husband to Mother Mary, and foster father of Jesus. Replacing another feast to St. Joseph, this date was chosen by Pope Pius XII in 1955 as a counterpoint to the communist International Workers&#x27; Day celebrations on May Day.

The best known modern May Day traditions, observed both in Europe and North America, include dancing around the maypole and crowning the Queen of May. Fading in popularity since the late 20th century is the tradition of giving of &quot;May baskets&quot;, small baskets of sweets or flowers, usually left anonymously on neighbours&#x27; doorsteps.

In the late 20th century, many neopagans began reconstructing some of the older pagan festivals and combining them with more recently developed European secular and Catholic traditions, and celebrating May Day as a pagan religious festival.

==Germanic regions==
=== Germany ===
In rural regions of Germany, especially the Harz Mountains, &quot;Walpurgisnacht&quot; celebrations are traditionally held on the night before May Day, including bonfires and the wrapping of a &quot;Maibaum&quot; (maypole). Young people use this opportunity to party, while the day itself is used by many families to get some fresh air. Motto: &quot;Tanz in den Mai&quot; (&quot;Dance into May&quot;).

In the Rhineland, 1 May is also celebrated by the delivery of a maypole, a tree covered in streamers to the house of a girl the night before. The tree is typically from a love interest, though a tree wrapped only in white streamers is a sign of dislike. Women usually place roses or rice in the form of a heart at the house of their beloved one. It is common to stick the heart to a window or place it in front of the doormat. In leap years, it is the responsibility of the women to place the maypole. All the action is usually done secretly and it is an individual&#x27;s choice whether to give a hint of their identity or stay anonymous.

May Day was not established as a public holiday until Nazi Germany declared 1 May a &quot;national workers&#x27; day&quot; in 1933. As Labour Day, many political parties and unions host activities related to work and employment.

=== Tyrol ===
In &quot;The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion&quot;, Sir James George Frazer reported May Day customs in Tyrol during the 19th century. It was a time for banishing evil powers from the community. On the last three days of April, all houses were fumigated with juniper and rue incense. At sunset on May Day, the people held a ceremony they called &quot;burning out the witches&quot;. The church bells were rung and people made as much noise as possible by shouting, banging pots and pans, ringing bells and cracking whips. Men carried lighted bundles of herbs fasted on poles, while women carried censers. Then would run seven times round the houses and the village, so that the witches would be &quot;smoked out of their lurking-places and driven away&quot;.

=== Sweden ===
In Sweden, there are bonfires and outdoor celebrations on May Eve or Walpurgis Night (&quot;Valborgsmässoafton&quot;). Most of the traditions associated elsewhere with May Day are held at Midsummer instead; such as Maypole dancing.

Up until the 19th century, on May Day itself, there were mock battles between Summer and Winter. Sir James George Frazer wrote in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (1911):on May Day two troops of young men on horseback used to meet as if for mortal combat. One of them was led by a representative of Winter clad in furs, who threw snowballs and ice in order to prolong the cold weather. The other troop was commanded by a representative of Summer covered with fresh leaves and flowers. In the sham fight which followed the party of Summer came off victorious, and the ceremony ended with a feast

Sweden&#x27;s first May Day celebration was held in Halmstad on 2nd of May, 1897 because 1st of May was a workday.

==Celtic regions==
=== Ireland ===

In Ireland, May Day has long been celebrated as the festival of &quot;Bealtaine&quot;. It marks the beginning of summer and historically was when cattle were driven out to the summer pastures. Rituals were performed to protect cattle, people and crops, and to encourage growth. Special bonfires were kindled, whose flames, smoke and ashes were deemed to have protective powers. The people and their cattle would walk around or between bonfires, and sometimes leap over the flames or embers. All household fires would be doused and then re-lit from the Bealtaine bonfire. These gatherings would be accompanied by a feast, and some of the food and drink would be offered to the , the &#x27;spirits&#x27; or &#x27;fairies&#x27;. Doors, windows, byres and cattle would be decorated with yellow May flowers, perhaps because they evoked fire. In parts of Ireland, people would make a May Bush: typically a thorn bush or branch decorated with flowers, ribbons, bright shells and rushlights. Holy wells were also visited, while Bealtaine dew was thought to bring beauty and maintain youthfulness.

For almost two centuries, the Dublin suburb of Finglas was well known for its &quot;May Games&quot; and its maypole &quot;was one of the last to survive in Dublin&quot;, according to historian Michael J. Tutty.
Throughout the eighteenth century, the Finglas maypole was at the centre of a week of festivity which included &quot;the playing of games, various competitions, and, according to one account the crowning of &#x27;Queen of the May&#x27;.&quot; In a letter written by Major Sirr on 2 May 1803 (shortly after the turbulent 1798 Rebellion), he writes:Godfrey and I went to Finglass and found everything in order. Major Wilkinson, who resides, there, waited upon me... and told me there was not the smallest occasion for military aid nor was there the least possibility of any disturbance... I ordered the guard to return to Dublin and these gentlemen and their families seemed quite rejoiced that the old custom of Maying was not to be interrupted in Finglass where that amusement has been kept up for a century past without ever being curbed before.Public celebrations of Bealtaine fell out of popularity by the 20th century and many old traditions are no longer widely observed. The tradition of a May Bush was reported as being suppressed by law and the magistrates in Dublin in the 18th century. The tradition of lighting bonfires has survived in parts of the country, and other traditions continue to be revived as local cultural events.

===Scotland===

May Day has been celebrated in Scotland for centuries. It was previously closely associated with the Beltane festival. Reference to this earlier celebration is found in poem &#x27;Peblis to the Play&#x27;, contained in the Maitland Manuscripts of 15th- and 16th-century Scots poetry:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;At Beltane, quhen ilk bodie bownis
To Peblis to the Play,
To heir the singin and the soundis;
The solace, suth to say,
Be firth and forrest furth they found
Thay graythis tham full gay;
God wait that wald they do that stound,
For it was their feast day the day they celebrate May Day,
Thay said, [...]&lt;/poem&gt;

The poem describes the celebration in the town of Peebles in the Scottish Borders, which continues to stage a parade and pageant each year, including the annual &#x27;Common Riding&#x27;, which takes place in many towns throughout the Borders. As well as the crowning of a Beltane Queen each year, it is custom to sing &#x27;The Beltane Song&#x27;.

John Jamieson, in his &quot;Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language&quot; (1808) describes some of the May Day/Beltane customs which persisted in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in parts of Scotland, which he noted were beginning to die out. In the nineteenth century, folklorist Alexander Carmichael (1832–1912), collected the song &quot;Am Beannachadh Bealltain&quot; (&quot;The Beltane Blessing&quot;) in his &quot;Carmina Gadelica&quot;, which he heard from a crofter in South Uist.

Scottish May Day/Beltane celebrations have been somewhat revived since the late twentieth century. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow organise May Day festivals and rallies. In Edinburgh, the Beltane Fire Festival is held on the evening of May eve and into the early hours of May Day on the city&#x27;s Calton Hill. An older Edinburgh tradition has it that young women who climb Arthur&#x27;s Seat and wash their faces in the morning dew will have lifelong beauty. At the University of St Andrews, some of the students gather on the beach late on 30 April and run into the North Sea at sunrise on May Day, occasionally naked. This is accompanied by torchlit processions and much elated celebration.

=== Wales ===
In Wales, the first day of May is known as &quot;Calan Mai&quot; or &quot;Calan Haf&quot;, and parallels the festival of Beltane and other May Day traditions in Europe.

Traditions would start the night before (&quot;Nos Galan Haf&quot;) with bonfires, and is considered a &quot;Ysbrydnos&quot; or &quot;spirit night&quot; when people would gather hawthorn (&quot;draenen wen&quot;) and flowers to decorate their houses, celebrating new growth and fertility. While on May Day celebrations would include summer dancing (&quot;dawnsio haf&quot;) and May carols (&quot;carolau mai&quot; or &quot;carolau haf&quot;) othertimes referred to as &quot;singing under the wall&quot; (&quot;canu dan y pared),&quot; May Day was also a time for officially opening a village green (twmpath chwarae).

=== Others ===
Many places across Great Britain and the world have begun to syncretize May Day and Beltane customs, hosting events that feature elements of both.

== Bulgaria ==
On May Day, Bulgarians celebrate Irminden (or Yeremiya, Eremiya, Irima, Zamski den). The holiday is associated with snakes and lizards and rituals are made in order to protect people from them. The name of the holiday comes from the prophet Jeremiah, but its origins are most probably pagan.

It is said that on the days of the Holy Forty or Annunciation snakes come out of their burrows, and on Irminden their king comes out. Old people believe that those working in the fields on this day will be bitten by a snake in summer.

Western Bulgarians light fires, jump over them and make noises to scare snakes. Another custom is to prepare &quot;podnici&quot; (special clay pots made for baking bread).

This day is especially observed by pregnant women so that their offspring do not catch &quot;yeremiya&quot;—an illness due to evil powers.

== Czech Republic ==
In the Czech Republic, May Day is traditionally considered a holiday of love and May as a month of love. The celebrations of spring are held on 30 April when a maypole () is erected—a tradition possibly connected to Beltane, since bonfires are also lit on the same day. The event is similar to German Walpurgisnacht, its public holiday on 30 April.
On 31 May, the maypole is taken down in an event called Maypole Felling.

On 1 May, couples in love kiss under a blooming tree. According to the ethnographer Klára Posekaná, this is not an old habit. It most likely originated around the beginning of the 20th century in an urban environment, perhaps in connection with Karel Hynek Mácha&#x27;s poem Máj (which is often recited during these days) and Petřín. This is usually done under a cherry, an apple or a birch tree.

==England==


Traditional English May Day rites and celebrations include crowning a May Queen and celebrations involving a maypole, around which dancers often circle with ribbons. Morris dancing is also often performed as part of May Day celebrations. The earliest records of maypole celebrations date to the 14th century, and by the 15th century the maypole tradition was well established in southern Britain. The tradition persists into the 21st century across the UK. The village of Ansty in Wiltshire has a maypole that has stood in the middle of a road junction in the village since before 1881; it continues in use every May Day, having been replaced by a less tall pole in the 1990s. Centenary Green part of the Octavia Hill Birthplace House, Wisbech has a flagpole which converts into a Maypole each year, used by local schools and other groups. Records from the early 1730s indicate that May Day was the date the new Mayor of Norwich was elected &quot;for the ensuring year&quot;. The &quot;Day of Swearing&quot; occurred the following month - June - which saw the Mayor Elect receive his chains of office.
The early May bank holiday on the first Monday in May was created in 1978; May Day itself1 Mayis not a public holiday in England (unless it falls on a Monday). In February 2011, the UK Parliament was reported to be considering scrapping the bank holiday associated with May Day, replacing it with a bank holiday in October, possibly coinciding with Trafalgar Day (celebrated on 21 October), to create a &quot;United Kingdom Day&quot;. Similarly, attempts were made by the John Major government in 1993 to abolish the May Day holiday and replace it with Trafalgar Day.

Unlike the other Bank Holidays and common law holidays, the first Monday in May is taken off from (state) schools by itself, and not as part of a half-term or end of term holiday. This is because it has no Christian significance and does not otherwise fit into the usual school holiday pattern. (By contrast, the Easter Holiday can start as late—relative to Easter—as Good Friday, if Easter falls early in the year; or finish as early—relative to Easter—as Easter Monday, if Easter falls late in the year, because of the supreme significance of Good Friday and Easter Day to Christianity.)

Other prominent English May Day customs include Jack in the Green, and &#x27;dancing the sun up&#x27; on May Day morning. Jack in the Green is an English folkloric figure who parades through the streets on May Day, accompanied by musicians, beggars, and various other characters. &#x27;Dancing the sun up&#x27; is a tradition among Morris dancers to dance at sunrise on May Day, to welcome in the sun and the summer season. It began in Oxford in 1923, and includes dances, traditional May Day songs, and sometimes other activities such as mummers&#x27; plays or bonfires. This tradition has since spread across the world, with Morris dance teams dancing the sun up in Asia, Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, and the USA.

May Day was abolished and its celebration banned by Puritan parliaments during the Interregnum, but reinstated with the restoration of Charles II in 1660. 1 May 1707, was the day the Act of Union came into effect, joining the kingdoms of England (including Wales) and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.

In Cambridgeshire villages, young girls went May Dolling (going around the villages with dressed dolls and collecting pennies). This dressing of dolls and singing was said to have persisted into the 1960s in Swaffham Prior

In Oxford, it is a centuries-old tradition for May Morning revellers to gather below the Great Tower of Magdalen College at 6am to listen to the college choir sing traditional madrigals as a conclusion to the previous night&#x27;s celebrations. Since the 1980s some people then jump off Magdalen Bridge into the River Cherwell. For some years, the bridge has been closed on 1 May to prevent people from jumping, as the water under the bridge is only deep and jumping from the bridge has resulted in serious injury in the past. There are still people who climb the barriers and leap into the water, causing themselves injury.

In Durham, students of the University of Durham gather on Prebend&#x27;s Bridge to see the sunrise and enjoy festivities, folk music, dancing, madrigal singing and a barbecue breakfast. This is an emerging Durham tradition, with patchy observance since 2001.

Kingsbury Episcopi, Somerset, has seen its yearly May Day Festival celebrations on the May bank holiday Monday burgeon in popularity in the recent years. Since it was reinstated 21 years ago it has grown in size, and on 5 May 2014 thousands of revellers were attracted from all over the south-west to enjoy the festivities, with BBC Somerset covering the celebrations. These include traditional maypole dancing and morris dancing, as well as contemporary music acts.

Whitstable, Kent, hosts a good example of more traditional May Day festivities, where the Jack in the Green festival was revived in 1976 and continues to lead an annual procession of morris dancers through the town on the May bank holiday. A separate revival occurred in Hastings in 1983 and has become a major event in the town calendar. A traditional sweeps festival is performed over the May bank holiday in Rochester, Kent, where the Jack in the Green is woken at dawn on 1 May by Morris dancers.

At 7:15 p.m. on 1 May each year, the Kettle Bridge Clogs morris dancing side dance across Barming Bridge (otherwise known as the Kettle Bridge), which spans the River Medway near Maidstone, to mark the official start of their morris dancing season.

The Maydayrun involves thousands of motorbikes taking a trip from Greater London (Locksbottom) to the Hastings seafront, East Sussex. The event has been taking place for almost 30 years now and has grown in interest from around the country, both commercially and publicly. The event is not officially organised; the police only manage the traffic, and volunteers manage the parking.

Padstow in Cornwall holds its annual &#x27;Obby-&#x27;Oss (Hobby Horse) day of festivities. This is believed to be one of the oldest fertility rites in the UK; revellers dance with the Oss through the streets of the town and even though the private gardens of the citizens, accompanied by accordion players and followers dressed in white with red or blue sashes who sing traditional May Day songs. The whole town is decorated with springtime greenery, and every year thousands of onlookers attend. Before the 19th century, distinctive May Day celebrations were widespread throughout West Cornwall, and are being revived in St Ives and Penzance. A similar &#x27;Obby &#x27;Oss festival is also held in the Somerset town of Minehead, dating back to at least the 19th century.

Kingsand, Cawsand and Millbrook in Cornwall celebrate Flower Boat Ritual on the May Day bank holiday. A model of the ship &quot;The Black Prince&quot; is covered in flowers and is taken in a procession from the Quay at Millbrook to the beach at Cawsand where it is cast adrift. The houses in the villages are decorated with flowers and people traditionally wear red and white clothes. There are further celebrations in Cawsand Square with Morris dancing and May pole dancing.

== Estonia ==
May Day or &quot;Spring Day&quot; (&quot;Kevadpüha&quot;) is a national holiday in Estonia celebrating the arrival of spring.

More traditional festivities take place throughout the night before and into the early hours of 1 May, on the Walpurgis Night (&quot;Volbriöö&quot;).

== Finland ==

In Finland, Walpurgis night (&#x27;) (&quot;&quot;) is one of the five biggest holidays along with Christmas Eve, New Year&#x27;s Eve, Easter (&#x27;), and Midsummer (&#x27;). Walpurgis witnesses the biggest carnival-style festival held in Finland&#x27;s cities and towns. The celebrations, which begin on the evening of 30 April and continue on 1 May, typically centre on the consumption of sima, sparkling wine and other alcoholic beverages. Student traditions, particularly those of engineering students, are one of the main characteristics of &#x27;. Since the end of the 19th century, this traditional upper-class feast has been appropriated by university students. Many &quot;&quot; (university-preparatory high school) alumni wear the black and white student cap and many higher education students wear student coveralls. One tradition is to drink sima, a home-made low-alcohol mead, along with freshly cooked funnel cakes.

== France ==
On 1 May 1561, King Charles IX of France received a lily of the valley as a lucky charm. He decided to offer a lily of the valley each year to the ladies of the court. At the beginning of the 20th century, it became custom to give a sprig of lily of the valley, a symbol of springtime, on 1 May. The government permits individuals and workers&#x27; organisations to sell them tax-free on that single day. Nowadays, people may present loved ones either with bunches of lily of the valley or dog rose flowers.

== Greece ==
1 May is a day that celebrates Spring.

Maios (Latin Maius), the month of May, took its name from the goddess Maia (Gr ), a Greek and Roman goddess of fertility. The day of Maios (Modern Greek Πρωτομαγιά) celebrates the final victory of the summer against winter as the victory of life against death. The celebration is similar to an ancient ritual associated with another minor demi-god Adonis which also celebrated the revival of nature. There is today some conflation with yet another tradition, the revival or marriage of Dionysus (the Greek God of theatre and wine-making). This event, however, was celebrated in ancient times not in May but in association with the Anthesteria, a festival held in February and dedicated to the goddess of agriculture Demeter and her daughter Persephone. Persephone emerged every year at the end of winter from the Underworld. The Anthesteria was a festival of souls, plants and flowers, and Persephone&#x27;s coming to earth from Hades marked the rebirth of nature, a common theme in all these traditions.

What remains of the customs today, echoes these traditions of antiquity. A common, until recently, May Day custom involved the annual revival of a youth called Adonis, or alternatively of Dionysus, or of Maios (in Modern Greek Μαγιόπουλο, the Son of Maia). In a simple theatrical ritual, the significance of which has long been forgotten, a chorus of young girls sang a song over a youth lying on the ground, representing Adonis, Dionysus or Maios. At the end of the song, the youth rose up and a flower wreath was placed on his head.

The most common aspect of modern May Day celebrations is the preparation of a flower wreath from wild flowers, although as a result of urbanisation there is an increasing trend to buy wreaths from flower shops. The flowers are placed on the wreath against a background of green leaves and the wreath is hung either on the entrance to the family house/apartment or on a balcony. It remains there until midsummer night. On that night, the flower wreaths are set alight in bonfires known as Saint John&#x27;s fires. Youths leap over the flames consuming the flower wreaths. This custom has also practically disappeared, like the theatrical revival of Adonis/Dionysus/Maios, as a result of rising urban traffic and with no alternative public grounds in most Greek city neighbourhoods.

== Hungary ==
In Hungary it is called St. Philip and Jacob&#x27;s day or sometimes Zöldfarsang. However, contrary to the name, the ecclesiastical explanation of the feast actually refers to the miracle of St. Walpurga. In contrast, the Hexennacht tradition has survived in only a few places, with witchcraft traditions usually taking place on other days.

The Majális, a merry folk festival, was usually held in a nearby forest, with the food and drink being taken along, which was usually attended by the whole town. There were sack-races, tree climbing, wrestling, strength tests, horse races, singing, dancing and military songs. It was a day of relaxing and walking in nature.

The Majális has a rich tradition in the country, celebrated with dance festivals, concert series and funfairs, set up all throughout the country. There is also an &quot;utcabál&quot; (&quot;street bal&quot;), when the streets are often filled with dancing residents.

In smaller settlements like (in e.g. Pilisszentkereszt) together with their neighbouring municipalities, set up a May Pole.

In Hungary it was customary to set up May Poles (májfa or májusfa) in several places in the town. It was usually set on May Day or Pentecost. Sometimes they were just tied to the fence, but most of the time they were planted in the ground. The trees were carved and erected in secret, usually in the dead of night. The aim was always to go out with the girls. the boys set them up (usually one for every unmarried girl) and it was danced around together. For the night the tree was usually guarded, so that it would not be taken away by rivals, or toppled by a rival&#x27;s courting team.

&quot;Drink water on an empty stomach: the lungs will be renewed&quot; - they used to say in Transylvania, where it was customary for girls to go to the spring or river on this day to wash their faces in water, which was believed to have magical powers to make them beautiful and healthy. Other superstitions include decorating the house with elderberries to ward off witches, and that the butter spat out on this day, called Philip-Jacob butter, can be used to treat earache.

== Italy ==
In Italy it is called &quot;Calendimaggio&quot; or &quot;cantar maggio&quot; a seasonal feast held to celebrate the arrival of spring. The event takes its name from the period in which it takes place, that is, the beginning of May, from the Latin &quot;kalendae maiae&quot;. The Calendimaggio is a tradition still alive today in many regions of Italy as an allegory of the return to life and rebirth: among these Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna (for example, is celebrated in the area of the &quot;Quattro Province&quot; or Piacenza, Pavia, Alessandria and Genoa), Tuscany and Umbria. This magical-propitiatory ritual is often performed during an almsgiving in which, in exchange for gifts (traditionally eggs, wine, food or sweets), the Maggi (or maggerini) sing auspicious verses to the inhabitants of the houses they visit. Throughout the Italian peninsula these &quot;Il Maggio&quot; couplets are very diverse—most are love songs with a strong romantic theme, that young people sang to celebrate the arrival of spring. Roman families traditionally eat pecorino with fresh fava beans during an excursion in the Roman Campagna. Symbols of spring revival are the trees (alder, golden rain) and flowers (violets, roses), mentioned in the verses of the songs, and with which the maggerini adorn themselves. In particular the plant alder, which grows along the rivers, is considered the symbol of life and that&#x27;s why it is often present in the ritual.

Calendimaggio can be historically noted in Tuscany as a mythical character who had a predominant role and met many of the attributes of the god Belenus. In Lucania, the &#x27;Maggi&#x27; have a clear auspicious character of pagan origin. In Syracuse, Sicily, the &quot;Albero della Cuccagna&quot; (cf. &quot;Greasy pole&quot;) is held during the month of May, a feast celebrated to commemorate the victory over the Athenians led by Nicias. However, Angelo de Gubernatis, in his work &quot;Mythology of Plants&quot;, believes that without doubt the festival was previous to that of said victory.

It is a celebration that dates back to ancient peoples, and is very integrated with the rhythms of nature, such as the Celts (celebrating Beltane), Etruscans and Ligures, in which the arrival of summer was of great importance.

== Portugal ==

&quot;Maias&quot; is a superstition throughout Portugal, with special focus on the northern territories and rarely elsewhere. Maias is the dominant naming in Northern Portugal, but it may be referred to by other names, including Dia das Bruxas (Witches&#x27; day), O Burro (the Donkey, referring to an evil spirit) or the last of April, as the local traditions preserved to this day occur on that evening only. People put the yellow flowers of broom, the bushes are known as giestas. The flowers of the bush are known as Maias, which are placed on doors or gates and every doorway of houses, windows, granaries, currently also cars, which the populace collect on the evening of 30 April when the Portuguese brooms are blooming, to defend those places from bad spirits, witches and the evil eye. The placement of the May flower or bush in the doorway must be done before midnight.

These festivities are a continuum of the &quot;Os Maios&quot; of Galiza. In ancient times, this was done while playing traditional night-music. In some places, children were dressed in these flowers and went from place to place begging for money or bread. On 1 May, people also used to sing &quot;Cantigas de Maio&quot;, traditional songs related to this day and the whole month of May.

The origin of this tradition can be traced to the Catholic Church story of Mary and Joseph fleeing to Egypt to protect Jesus from Herod. It was said that brooms could be found at the door of the house holding Jesus, but when Herod&#x27;s soldiers arrived to the place they found every door decorated with brooms.

== Romania ==
On May Day, the Romanians celebrate the &quot;arminden&quot; (or &quot;armindeni&quot;), the beginning of summer, symbolically tied with the protection of crops and farm animals. The name comes from Slavonic &quot;Jeremiinŭ dĭnĭ&quot;, meaning prophet Jeremiah&#x27;s day, but the celebration rites and habits of this day are apotropaic and pagan (possibly originating in the cult of the god Pan).

The day is also called &quot;ziua pelinului&quot; (&quot;mugwort day&quot;) or &quot;ziua bețivilor&quot; (&quot;drunkards&#x27; day&quot;) and it is celebrated to ensure good wine in autumn and, for people and farm animals alike, good health and protection from the elements of nature (storms, hail, illness, pests). People would have parties in natural surroundings, with &quot;lăutari&quot; (fiddlers) for those who could afford it. Then it is customary to roast and eat lamb, along with new mutton cheese, and to drink mugwort-flavoured wine, or just red wine, to refresh the blood and get protection from diseases. On the way back, the men wear lilac or mugwort flowers on their hats.

Other apotropaic rites include, in some areas of the country, people washing their faces with the morning dew (for good health) and adorning the gates for good luck and abundance with green branches or with birch saplings (for the houses with maiden girls). The entries to the animals&#x27; shelters are also adorned with green branches. All branches are left in place until the wheat harvest when they are used in the fire which will bake the first bread from the new wheat.

On May Day eve, country women do not work in the field as well as in the house to avoid devastating storms and hail coming down on the village.

&quot;Arminden&quot; is also &quot;ziua boilor&quot; (oxen day) and thus the animals are not to be used for work, or else they could die or their owners could get ill.

It is said that the weather is always good on May Day to allow people to celebrate.

== Serbia ==

&quot;Prvomajski uranak&quot; (Reveille on 1 May) is a folk tradition and feast that consists of the fact that on 1 May, people go in the nature or even leave the day before and spend the night with a camp fire. Most of the time, a dish is cooked in a kettle or in a barbecue. Among Serbs this holiday is widespread. Almost every town in Serbia has its own traditional first-of-may excursion sites, and most often these are green areas outside the city.

== Spain ==
May Day is celebrated throughout the country as &quot;Los Mayos&quot; (lit. &quot;the Mays&quot;) often in a similar way to &quot;Fiesta de las Cruces&quot; in many parts of Hispanic America. One such example, in Galicia, is the festival &quot;Fiesta de los Mayos&quot; (or &quot;Festa dos Maios&quot; in Galician, the local language). It has a Celtic origin (from the festivity of Beltane) and consists of different traditions, such as representations around a decorated tree or sculpture. People sing popular songs (also called &quot;maios&quot;,) making mentions of social and political events during the past year, sometimes under the form of a converse, while they walk around the sculpture with the percussion of two sticks. In Lugo and in the village of Vilagarcía de Arousa it was usual to ask a tip to the attendees, which used to be a handful of dry chestnuts (&quot;castañas maiolas&quot;), walnuts or hazelnuts. Today the tradition became a competition where the best sculptures and songs receive a prize.

In the Galician city of Ourense, this day is celebrated traditionally on 3 May, the day of the Holy Cross, that in the Christian tradition replaced the tree &quot;where the health, life and resurrection are,&quot; according to the introit of that day&#x27;s mass.

== North America ==
=== Canada ===
May Day is celebrated in some parts of the provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario.

Toronto

In Toronto, on the morning of 1 May, various Morris Dancing troops from Toronto and Hamilton gather on the road by Grenadier Cafe, in High Park to &quot;dance in the May&quot;. The dancers and crowd then gather together and sing traditional May Day songs such as Hal-An-Tow and Padstow.

British Columbia

Celebrations often take place not on 1 May but during the Victoria Day long weekend, later in the month and when the weather is likely to be better. The longest continually observed May Day in the British Commonwealth is held in the city of New Westminster, BC. There, the first May Day celebration was held on 4 May 1870.

=== United States ===
Early European settlers of the Americas brought their May Day traditions with them, and May Day is still celebrated in many parts of the United States, with customs that vary from region to region. In some parts of the United States, May baskets are made. These are small baskets usually filled with flowers or treats and left at someone&#x27;s doorstep. The giver rings the bell and runs away.
May Day celebrations were common at women&#x27;s colleges and academic institutions in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, a tradition that continues at Bryn Mawr College and Brenau University to this day.

In Minneapolis, the May Day Parade and Festival is presented annually on the first Sunday in May, and draws around 50,000 people to Powderhorn Park. The festival was originated by In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre and is now decentralized and community-run. On 1 May itself, local Morris Dance sides converge on an overlook of the Mississippi River at dawn, and then spend the remainder of the day dancing around the metro area.

Morris dancers in the US have continued the English custom of &#x27;dancing the sun up&#x27; on May Day, dancing at sunrise to welcome in the sun and the summer season. In 2024, Morris dancers danced the sun up in Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Hawaii

In Hawaii, May Day is also known as Lei Day, and it is normally set aside as a day to celebrate island culture in general and the culture of the Native Hawaiians in particular. Invented by poet and local newspaper columnist Don Blanding, the first Lei Day was celebrated on 1 May 1927 in Honolulu. Leonard &quot;Red&quot; and Ruth Hawk composed &quot;May Day Is Lei Day in Hawai&#x27;i&quot;, the traditional holiday song.

In physics (in particular in statistical mechanics), the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, or Maxwell(ian) distribution, is a particular probability distribution named after James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann.

It was first defined and used for describing particle speeds in idealized gases, where the particles move freely inside a stationary container without interacting with one another, except for very brief collisions in which they exchange energy and momentum with each other or with their thermal environment. The term &quot;particle&quot; in this context refers to gaseous particles only (atoms or molecules), and the system of particles is assumed to have reached thermodynamic equilibrium. The energies of such particles follow what is known as Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics, and the statistical distribution of speeds is derived by equating particle energies with kinetic energy.

Mathematically, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is the chi distribution with three degrees of freedom (the components of the velocity vector in Euclidean space), with a scale parameter measuring speeds in units proportional to the square root of formula_8 (the ratio of temperature and particle mass).

The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is a result of the kinetic theory of gases, which provides a simplified explanation of many fundamental gaseous properties, including pressure and diffusion. The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution applies fundamentally to particle velocities in three dimensions, but turns out to depend only on the speed (the magnitude of the velocity) of the particles. A particle speed probability distribution indicates which speeds are more likely: a randomly chosen particle will have a speed selected randomly from the distribution, and is more likely to be within one range of speeds than another. The kinetic theory of gases applies to the classical ideal gas, which is an idealization of real gases. In real gases, there are various effects (e.g., van der Waals interactions, vortical flow, relativistic speed limits, and quantum exchange interactions) that can make their speed distribution different from the Maxwell–Boltzmann form. However, rarefied gases at ordinary temperatures behave very nearly like an ideal gas and the Maxwell speed distribution is an excellent approximation for such gases. This is also true for ideal plasmas, which are ionized gases of sufficiently low density.

The distribution was first derived by Maxwell in 1860 on heuristic grounds. Boltzmann later, in the 1870s, carried out significant investigations into the physical origins of this distribution. The distribution can be derived on the ground that it maximizes the entropy of the system. A list of derivations are:

# Maximum entropy probability distribution in the phase space, with the constraint of conservation of average energy formula_9
# Canonical ensemble.

== Distribution function ==
For a system containing a large number of identical non-interacting, non-relativistic classical particles in thermodynamic equilibrium, the fraction of the particles within an infinitesimal element of the three-dimensional velocity space , centered on a velocity vector formula_10 of magnitude formula_11, is given by
formula_12
where:
* is the particle mass;
* is the Boltzmann constant;
* is thermodynamic temperature;
*formula_13 is a probability distribution function, properly normalized so that formula_14 over all velocities is unity.
One can write the element of velocity space as formula_15, for velocities in a standard Cartesian coordinate system, or as formula_16 in a standard spherical coordinate system, where formula_17 is an element of solid angle and formula_18. 

The Maxwellian distribution function for particles moving in only one direction, if this direction is , is
formula_19
which can be obtained by integrating the three-dimensional form given above over and .

Recognizing the symmetry of formula_20, one can integrate over solid angle and write a probability distribution of speeds as the function

formula_21

This probability density function gives the probability, per unit speed, of finding the particle with a speed near . This equation is simply the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution (given in the infobox) with distribution parameter formula_22 
The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is equivalent to the chi distribution with three degrees of freedom and scale parameter formula_22

The simplest ordinary differential equation satisfied by the distribution is:
formula_24

or in unitless presentation:
formula_25
With the Darwin–Fowler method of mean values, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is obtained as an exact result.

== Relaxation to the 2D Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution ==
For particles confined to move in a plane, the speed distribution is given by

formula_26

This distribution is used for describing systems in equilibrium. However, most systems do not start out in their equilibrium state. The evolution of a system towards its equilibrium state is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The equation predicts that for short range interactions, the equilibrium velocity distribution will follow a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. To the right is a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in which 900 hard sphere particles are constrained to move in a rectangle. They interact via perfectly elastic collisions. The system is initialized out of equilibrium, but the velocity distribution (in blue) quickly converges to the 2D Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution (in orange).

== Typical speeds ==

The mean speed formula_27, most probable speed (mode) , and root-mean-square speed formula_28 can be obtained from properties of the Maxwell distribution.

This works well for nearly ideal, monatomic gases like helium, but also for molecular gases like diatomic oxygen. This is because despite the larger heat capacity (larger internal energy at the same temperature) due to their larger number of degrees of freedom, their translational kinetic energy (and thus their speed) is unchanged.

&lt;/math&gt; is still the mean translational kinetic energy. Nitrogen being diatomic only affects the value of the molar mass .
See e.g. K. Prakashan, &quot;Engineering Physics&quot; (2001), 2.278.&lt;/ref&gt; at room temperature (), this gives
formula_29
| The mean speed is the expected value of the speed distribution, setting formula_30: formula_31
| The mean square speed formula_32 is the second-order raw moment of the speed distribution. The &quot;root mean square speed&quot; formula_33 is the square root of the mean square speed, corresponding to the speed of a particle with average kinetic energy, setting formula_34: formula_35

In summary, the typical speeds are related as follows:
formula_36

The root mean square speed is directly related to the speed of sound in the gas, by
formula_37
where formula_38 is the adiabatic index, is the number of degrees of freedom of the individual gas molecule. For the example above, diatomic nitrogen (approximating air) at , formula_39 and
formula_40
the true value for air can be approximated by using the average molar weight of air (), yielding at (corrections for variable humidity are of the order of 0.1% to 0.6%).

The average relative velocity
formula_41
where the three-dimensional velocity distribution is
formula_42

The integral can easily be done by changing to coordinates formula_43 and formula_44

==Limitations==
The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution assumes that the velocities of individual particles are much less than the speed of light, i.e. that formula_45. For electrons, the temperature of electrons must be formula_46.

==Derivation and related distributions==
===Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics===

The original derivation in 1860 by James Clerk Maxwell was an argument based on molecular collisions of the Kinetic theory of gases as well as certain symmetries in the speed distribution function; Maxwell also gave an early argument that these molecular collisions entail a tendency towards equilibrium. After Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872 also derived the distribution on mechanical grounds and argued that gases should over time tend toward this distribution, due to collisions (see H-theorem). He later (1877) derived the distribution again under the framework of statistical thermodynamics. The derivations in this section are along the lines of Boltzmann&#x27;s 1877 derivation, starting with result known as Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics (from statistical thermodynamics). Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics gives the average number of particles found in a given single-particle microstate. Under certain assumptions, the logarithm of the fraction of particles in a given microstate is linear in the ratio of the energy of that state to the temperature of the system: there are constants formula_47 and formula_48 such that, for all formula_49,
formula_50
The assumptions of this equation are that the particles do not interact, and that they are classical; this means that each particle&#x27;s state can be considered independently from the other particles&#x27; states. Additionally, the particles are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium.

This relation can be written as an equation by introducing a normalizing factor:
where:
* is the expected number of particles in the single-particle microstate ,
* is the total number of particles in the system,
* is the energy of microstate ,
* the sum over index takes into account all microstates, 
* is the equilibrium temperature of the system,
* is the Boltzmann constant.
The denominator in is a normalizing factor so that the ratios formula_51 add up to unity — in other words it is a kind of partition function (for the single-particle system, not the usual partition function of the entire system).

Because velocity and speed are related to energy, Equation () can be used to derive relationships between temperature and the speeds of gas particles. All that is needed is to discover the density of microstates in energy, which is determined by dividing up momentum space into equal sized regions.

===Distribution for the momentum vector===

The potential energy is taken to be zero, so that all energy is in the form of kinetic energy.
The relationship between kinetic energy and momentum for massive non-relativistic particles is

where is the square of the momentum vector . We may therefore rewrite Equation () as:

where:
* is the partition function, corresponding to the denominator in ;
* is the molecular mass of the gas;
* is the thermodynamic temperature;
* is the Boltzmann constant. 
This distribution of is proportional to the probability density function for finding a molecule with these values of momentum components, so:

The normalizing constant can be determined by recognizing that the probability of a molecule having &quot;some&quot; momentum must be 1.
Integrating the exponential in over all , , and yields a factor of 
formula_52

So that the normalized distribution function is:
The distribution is seen to be the product of three independent normally distributed variables formula_53, formula_54, and formula_55, with variance formula_56. Additionally, it can be seen that the magnitude of momentum will be distributed as a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, with formula_57. The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the momentum (or equally for the velocities) can be obtained more fundamentally using the H-theorem at equilibrium within the Kinetic theory of gases framework.

===Distribution for the energy===

The energy distribution is found imposing

where formula_58 is the infinitesimal phase-space volume of momenta corresponding to the energy interval .
Making use of the spherical symmetry of the energy-momentum dispersion relation formula_59 this can be expressed in terms of as

Using then () in (), and expressing everything in terms of the energy , we get
formula_60
and finally

 \, \left[\frac{1}{k_\text{B}T}\right]^{3/2} \exp\left(-\frac{E}{k_\text{B}T} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding |border |border colour = #50C878 |background colour = #ECFCF4|ref=9}}

Since the energy is proportional to the sum of the squares of the three normally distributed momentum components, this energy distribution can be written equivalently as a gamma distribution, using a shape parameter, formula_61 and a scale parameter, formula_62

Using the equipartition theorem, given that the energy is evenly distributed among all three degrees of freedom in equilibrium, we can also split formula_63 into a set of chi-squared distributions, where the energy per degree of freedom, is distributed as a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom,
formula_64

At equilibrium, this distribution will hold true for any number of degrees of freedom. For example, if the particles are rigid mass dipoles of fixed dipole moment, they will have three translational degrees of freedom and two additional rotational degrees of freedom. The energy in each degree of freedom will be described according to the above chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, and the total energy will be distributed according to a chi-squared distribution with five degrees of freedom. This has implications in the theory of the specific heat of a gas.

===Distribution for the velocity vector===

Recognizing that the velocity probability density is proportional to the momentum probability density function by

formula_65

and using we get

which is the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution. The probability of finding a particle with velocity in the infinitesimal element about velocity is

formula_66

Like the momentum, this distribution is seen to be the product of three independent normally distributed variables formula_67, formula_68, and formula_69, but with variance formula_70.
It can also be seen that the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution for the vector velocity
 is the product of the distributions for each of the three directions:
formula_71
where the distribution for a single direction is
formula_72

Each component of the velocity vector has a normal distribution with mean formula_73 and standard deviation formula_74, so the vector has a 3-dimensional normal distribution, a particular kind of multivariate normal distribution, with mean formula_75 and covariance formula_76, where formula_77 is the identity matrix.

===Distribution for the speed===

The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the speed follows immediately from the distribution of the velocity vector, above. Note that the speed is
formula_78
and the volume element in spherical coordinates
formula_79
where formula_80 and formula_81 are the spherical coordinate angles of the velocity vector. Integration of the probability density function of the velocity over the solid angles formula_82 yields an additional factor of formula_83.
The speed distribution with substitution of the speed for the sum of the squares of the vector components:
 \, \biggl[\frac{m}{k_\text{B}T}\biggr]^{3/2} v^2 \exp\left(-\frac{mv^2}{2k_\text{B}T}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;}}

== In &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space ==
In -dimensional space, Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution becomes:
formula_84

Speed distribution becomes:
formula_85
where formula_86 is a normalizing constant.

The following integral result is useful:
formula_87
where formula_88 is the Gamma function. This result can be used to calculate the moments of speed distribution function:
formula_89
which is the mean speed itself formula_90

formula_91
which gives root-mean-square speed formula_92

The derivative of speed distribution function:
formula_93

This yields the most probable speed (mode) formula_94

<doc id="19831" wikidata="Q7416" url="?curid=19831" title="Margaret Thatcher">
<text>Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher (; 13 October 19258 April 2013), was a British stateswoman and Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to hold the position. As prime minister, she implemented policies that came to be known as Thatcherism. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the &quot;Iron Lady&quot;, a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style.

Thatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, and worked briefly as a research chemist before becoming a barrister. She was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her secretary of state for education and science in his 1970–1974 government. In 1975, she defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become leader of the opposition, the first woman to lead a major political party in the UK.

On becoming prime minister after winning the 1979 general election, Thatcher introduced a series of economic policies intended to reverse high inflation and Britain&#x27;s struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an oncoming recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised greater individual liberty, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Her popularity in her first years in office waned amid recession and rising unemployment. Victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her landslide re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt by the Provisional IRA in the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing and achieved a political victory against the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike. In 1986, Thatcher oversaw the deregulation of UK financial markets, leading to an economic boom, in what came to be known as the Big Bang.

Thatcher was re-elected for a third term with another landslide in 1987, but her subsequent support for the Community Charge (also known as the &quot;poll tax&quot;) was widely unpopular, and her increasingly Eurosceptic views on the European Community were not shared by others in her cabinet. She resigned as prime minister and party leader in 1990, after a challenge was launched to her leadership, and was succeeded by John Major, her chancellor of the Exchequer. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher (of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. In 2013, she died of a stroke at the Ritz Hotel, London, at the age of 87.

A polarising figure in British politics, Thatcher is nonetheless viewed favourably in historical rankings and public opinion of British prime ministers. Her tenure constituted a realignment towards neoliberal policies in Britain; the complex legacy attributed to this shift continues to be debated into the 21st century.
==Early life and education==
=== Family and childhood (1925–1943) ===
Margaret Hilda Roberts was born on 13 October 1925 in Grantham, Lincolnshire. Her parents were Alfred Roberts (1892–1970), from Northamptonshire, and Beatrice Ethel Stephenson (1888–1960), from Lincolnshire. Her father&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Catherine Sullivan, was born in County Kerry, Ireland.

Roberts spent her childhood in Grantham, where her father owned a tobacconist&#x27;s and a grocery shop. In 1938, before the Second World War, the Roberts family briefly gave sanctuary to a teenage Jewish girl who had escaped Nazi Germany. With her elder sister Muriel, Margaret saved pocket money to help pay for the teenager&#x27;s journey.

Alfred was an alderman and a Methodist local preacher. He brought up his daughter as a strict Wesleyan Methodist, attending the Finkin Street Methodist Church, but Margaret was more sceptical; the future scientist told a friend that she could not believe in angels, having calculated that they needed a breastbone long to support wings. Alfred came from a Liberal family but stood (as was then customary in local government) as an Independent. He served as Mayor of Grantham from 1945 to 1946 and lost his position as alderman in 1952 after the Labour Party won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950.

Roberts attended Huntingtower Road Primary School and won a scholarship to Kesteven and Grantham Girls&#x27; School, a grammar school. Her school reports showed hard work and continual improvement; her extracurricular activities included the piano, field hockey, poetry recitals, swimming and walking. She was head girl in 1942–43, and outside school, while the Second World War was ongoing, she voluntarily worked as a fire watcher in the local ARP service. Other students thought of Roberts as the &quot;star scientist&quot;, although mistaken advice regarding cleaning ink from parquetry almost caused chlorine gas poisoning. In her upper sixth year, Roberts was accepted for a scholarship to study chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, a women&#x27;s college, starting in 1944. After another candidate withdrew, Roberts entered Oxford in October 1943.

===Oxford (1943–1947)===
Following her arrival at Oxford, Roberts began studies under X-ray crystallographer Dorothy Hodgkin, the tutor in chemistry for Somerville College since 1934. Hodgkin considered Roberts a &quot;good&quot; student, and later recalled: &quot;One could always rely on her producing a sensible, well-read essay.&quot; She opted to read for a classified honours degree, entailing an additional year of supervised research. As her thesis supervisor, Hodgkin assigned Roberts to work with Gerhard Schmidt, a researcher in Hodgkin&#x27;s lab, to determine the structure of the antibiotic peptide gramicidin S. Although the research made some progress, the peptide&#x27;s structure proved more complex than anticipated, and Schmidt would only determine its full structure much later; Roberts (by then Thatcher) learned this in the 1960s while visiting the Weizmann Institute, where her former research partner was then working.

Roberts graduated in 1947 with a second-class honours degree in chemistry, and in 1950 also received the degree of Master of Arts (as an Oxford BA, she was entitled to the degree 21 terms after her matriculation). Although Hodgkin would later be critical of her former student&#x27;s politics, they continued to correspond into the 1980s, and Roberts in her memoirs would describe her mentor as &quot;ever-helpful&quot;, &quot;a brilliant scientist and a gifted teacher&quot;. As prime minister, she would keep a portrait of Hodgkin at 10 Downing Street. Later in life, she was reportedly prouder of becoming the first prime minister with a science degree than becoming the first female prime minister. While prime minister she attempted to preserve Somerville as a women&#x27;s college. Twice a week outside study she worked in a local forces canteen.

During her time at Oxford, Roberts was noted for her isolated and serious attitude. Her first boyfriend, Tony Bray (1926–2014), recalled that she was &quot;very thoughtful and a very good conversationalist. That&#x27;s probably what interested me. She was good at general subjects&quot;.

She was a member of Wesley Memorial Church, became a lay preacher and joined the John Wesley Society. She also attended Somerville College Chapel and St Mary&#x27;s.

Roberts&#x27;s coursework involved subjects beyond chemistry as she was already contemplating an entry into law and politics. Her enthusiasm for politics as a girl made Bray think of her as &quot;unusual&quot; and her parents as &quot;slightly austere&quot; and &quot;very proper&quot;. Roberts became President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1946. She was influenced at university by political works such as Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; (1944), which condemned economic intervention by government as a precursor to an authoritarian state.

===Post-Oxford career (1947–1951)===
After graduating, Roberts secured a position as a research chemist for British Xylonite (BX Plastics) following a series of interviews arranged by Oxford; she subsequently moved to Colchester in Essex to work at the firm. Little is known about her brief time there. By her own account, she was initially enthusiastic about the position, as she had been intended to function as a personal assistant to the company&#x27;s head of research and development, providing opportunities to learn about operations management: &quot;But on my arrival it was decided that there was not enough to do in that capacity.&quot; Instead, she seems to have researched methods of attaching polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to metals. While with the firm, she joined the Association of Scientific Workers. In 1948, she applied for a job at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) but was rejected after the personnel department assessed her as &quot;headstrong, obstinate and dangerously self-opinionated&quot;. Jon Agar in &quot;Notes and Records&quot; argues that her understanding of modern scientific research later impacted her views as prime minister.

Roberts joined the local Conservative Association and attended the party conference at Llandudno, Wales, in 1948, as a representative of the University Graduate Conservative Association. Meanwhile, she became a high-ranking affiliate of the Vermin Club, a group of grassroots Conservatives formed in response to a derogatory comment made by Aneurin Bevan. One of her Oxford friends was also a friend of the Chair of the Dartford Conservative Association in Kent, who were looking for candidates. Officials of the association were so impressed by her that they asked her to apply, even though she was not on the party&#x27;s approved list; she was selected in January 1950 (aged 24) and added to the approved list .

At a dinner following her formal adoption as Conservative candidate for Dartford in February 1949, she met divorcé Denis Thatcher, a successful and wealthy businessman, who drove her to her Essex train. After their first meeting, she described him to Muriel as &quot;not a very attractive creature – very reserved but quite nice&quot;. In preparation for the election, Roberts moved to Dartford, while she supported herself by working as a research chemist for J. Lyons and Co. in Hammersmith, reportedly as part of a team developing emulsifiers for ice cream. As the work was more theoretical in nature than during her prior role with BX Plastics, Roberts found it &quot;more satisfying&quot;. While at Lyons, she worked under the supervision of Hans Jellinek, who headed the company&#x27;s physical chemistry section. Jellinek assigned her to research the saponification of α-monostearin (glycerol monostearate), which has properties as an emulsifier, stabiliser and food preservative. Agar has noted the research may have been connected with the emulsification of ice cream, but only as a possibility. In September 1951, their research was published in the &quot;Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture&quot;, a recently launched publication of the Society of Chemical Industry, as &quot;The saponification of α-monostearin in a monolayer&quot;. This would be Roberts&#x27;s sole scientific publication. In 1979, following his former assistant&#x27;s election as prime minister, Jellinek, by then a professor of physical chemistry at Clarkson University in the United States, said she had done &quot;a very good job&quot; on the project, &quot;showing great determination&quot;. She sent Jellinek a congratulatory letter upon his retirement in 1984, and another letter shortly before his death two years later.

Roberts married at Wesley&#x27;s Chapel and her children were baptised there, but she and her husband began attending Church of England services and would later convert to Anglicanism.

==Early political career==
In the 1950 and 1951 general elections, Roberts was the Conservative candidate for the Labour seat of Dartford. The local party selected her as its candidate because, though not a dynamic public speaker, Roberts was well-prepared and fearless in her answers. A prospective candidate, Bill Deedes, recalled: &quot;Once she opened her mouth, the rest of us began to look rather second-rate.&quot; She attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate; in 1950, she was the youngest Conservative candidate in the country. She lost on both occasions to Norman Dodds but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000 and then a further 1,000. During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by her future husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951. She trained at the Inns of Court School of Law (now part of The City Law School) and qualified as a barrister in 1953 (specialising in taxation). Denis funded his wife&#x27;s studies for the bar. Later that same year, their twins Carol and Mark were born, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section.

===Member of Parliament (1959–1970)===
In 1954, Thatcher was defeated when she sought selection to be the Conservative Party candidate for the Orpington by-election of January 1955. She chose not to stand as a candidate in the 1955 general election, in later years, stating: &quot;I really just felt the twins were [...] only two, I really felt that it was too soon. I couldn&#x27;t do that.&quot; Afterwards, Thatcher began looking for a Conservative safe seat and was selected as the candidate for Finchley in April 1958 (narrowly beating Ian Montagu Fraser). She was elected as MP for the seat after a hard campaign in the 1959 election. Benefiting from her fortunate result in a lottery for backbenchers to propose new legislation, Thatcher&#x27;s maiden speech was, unusually, in support of her private member&#x27;s bill, the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960, requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public; the bill was successful and became law. In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party&#x27;s official position by voting for the restoration of birching as a judicial corporal punishment.

====On the frontbenches====
Thatcher&#x27;s talent and drive caused her to be mentioned as a future prime minister in her early 20s although she herself was more pessimistic, stating as late as 1970: &quot;There will not be a woman prime minister in my lifetime – the male population is too prejudiced.&quot; In October 1961 she was promoted to the frontbench as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry for Pensions by Harold Macmillan. Thatcher was the youngest woman in history to receive such a post, and among the first MPs elected in 1959 to be promoted. After the Conservatives lost the 1964 election, she became spokeswoman on housing and land. In that position, she advocated her party&#x27;s policy of giving tenants the right to buy their council houses. She moved to the Shadow Treasury team in 1966 and, as Treasury spokeswoman, opposed Labour&#x27;s mandatory price and income controls, arguing they would unintentionally produce effects that would distort the economy.

Jim Prior suggested Thatcher as a Shadow Cabinet member after the Conservatives&#x27; 1966 defeat, but party leader Edward Heath and Chief Whip William Whitelaw eventually chose Mervyn Pike as the Conservative shadow cabinet&#x27;s sole woman member. At the 1966 Conservative Party conference, Thatcher criticised the high-tax policies of the Labour government as being steps &quot;not only towards Socialism, but towards Communism&quot;, arguing that lower taxes served as an incentive to hard work. Thatcher was one of the few Conservative MPs to support Leo Abse&#x27;s bill to decriminalise male homosexuality. She voted in favour of David Steel&#x27;s bill to legalise abortion, as well as a ban on hare coursing. She supported the retention of capital punishment and voted against the relaxation of divorce laws.

====In the Shadow Cabinet====
In 1967, the United States Embassy chose Thatcher to take part in the International Visitor Leadership Program (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a professional exchange programme that allowed her to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Although she was not yet a Shadow Cabinet member, the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future prime minister. The description helped Thatcher meet with prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including Paul Samuelson, Walt Rostow, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer and Nelson Rockefeller. Following the visit, Heath appointed Thatcher to the Shadow Cabinet as fuel and power spokeswoman. Before the 1970 general election, she was promoted to shadow transport spokeswoman and later to education.

In 1968, Enoch Powell delivered his &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech in which he strongly criticised Commonwealth immigration to the United Kingdom and the then-proposed Race Relations Bill. When Heath telephoned Thatcher to inform her that he would sack Powell from the Shadow Cabinet, she recalled that she &quot;really thought that it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis&quot;. She believed that his main points about Commonwealth immigration were correct and that the selected quotations from his speech had been taken out of context. In a 1991 interview for &quot;Today&quot;, Thatcher stated that she thought Powell had &quot;made a valid argument, if in sometimes regrettable terms&quot;.

Around this time, she gave her first Commons speech as a shadow transport minister and highlighted the need for investment in British Rail. She argued: &quot;[I]f we build bigger and better roads, they would soon be saturated with more vehicles and we would be no nearer solving the problem.&quot; Thatcher made her first visit to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1969 as the Opposition transport spokeswoman, and in October, delivered a speech celebrating her ten years in Parliament. In early 1970, she told &quot;The Finchley Press&quot; that she would like to see a &quot;reversal of the permissive society&quot;.

===Education Secretary (1970–1974)===

The Conservative Party, led by Edward Heath, won the 1970 general election, and Thatcher was appointed to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Education and Science. Thatcher caused controversy when, after only a few days in office, she withdrew Labour&#x27;s Circular 10/65, which attempted to force comprehensivisation, without going through a consultation process. She was highly criticised for the speed at which she carried this out. Consequently, she drafted her own new policy (Circular 10/70), which ensured that local authorities were not forced to go comprehensive. Her new policy was not meant to stop the development of new comprehensives; she said: &quot;We shall [...] expect plans to be based on educational considerations rather than on the comprehensive principle.&quot;

Thatcher supported Lord Rothschild&#x27;s 1971 proposal for market forces to affect government funding of research. Although many scientists opposed the proposal, her research background probably made her sceptical of their claim that outsiders should not interfere with funding. The department evaluated proposals for more local education authorities to close grammar schools and to adopt comprehensive secondary education. Although Thatcher was committed to a tiered secondary modern-grammar school system of education and attempted to preserve grammar schools, during her tenure as education secretary, she turned down only 326 of 3,612 proposals (roughly 9 per cent) for schools to become comprehensives; the proportion of pupils attending comprehensive schools consequently rose from 32 per cent to 62 per cent. Nevertheless, she managed to save 94 grammar schools.
During her first months in office, she attracted public attention due to the government&#x27;s attempts to cut spending. She gave priority to academic needs in schools, while administering public expenditure cuts on the state education system, resulting in the abolition of free milk for schoolchildren aged seven to eleven. She held that few children would suffer if schools were charged for milk but agreed to provide younger children with daily for nutritional purposes. She also argued that she was simply carrying on with what the Labour government had started since they had stopped giving free milk to secondary schools. Milk would still be provided to those children that required it on medical grounds, and schools could still sell milk. The aftermath of the milk row hardened her determination; she told the editor-proprietor Harold Creighton of &quot;The Spectator&quot;: &quot;Don&#x27;t underestimate me, I saw how they broke Keith, but they won&#x27;t break me.&quot;

Cabinet papers later revealed that she opposed the policy but had been forced into it by the Treasury. Her decision provoked a storm of protest from Labour and the press, leading to her being notoriously nicknamed &quot;Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher&quot;. She reportedly considered leaving politics in the aftermath and later wrote in her autobiography: &quot;I learned a valuable lesson. I had incurred the maximum of political odium for the minimum of political benefit.&quot;

===Leader of the Opposition (1975–1979)===
The Heath government continued to experience difficulties with oil embargoes and union demands for wage increases in 1973, subsequently losing the February 1974 general election. Labour formed a minority government and went on to win a narrow majority in the October 1974 general election. Heath&#x27;s leadership of the Conservative Party looked increasingly in doubt. Thatcher was not initially seen as the obvious replacement, but she eventually became the main challenger, promising a fresh start. Her main support came from the parliamentary 1922 Committee and &quot;The Spectator&quot;, but Thatcher&#x27;s time in office gave her the reputation of a pragmatist rather than that of an ideologue. She defeated Heath on the first ballot, and he resigned from the leadership. In the second ballot she defeated Whitelaw, Heath&#x27;s preferred successor. Thatcher&#x27;s election had a polarising effect on the party; her support was stronger among MPs on the right, and also among those from southern England, and those who had not attended public schools or Oxbridge.

Thatcher became Conservative Party leader and Leader of the Opposition on 11 February 1975; she appointed Whitelaw as her deputy. Heath was never reconciled to Thatcher&#x27;s leadership of the party.

Television critic Clive James, writing in &quot;The Observer&quot; prior to her election as Conservative Party leader, compared her voice of 1973 to &quot;a cat sliding down a blackboard&quot;. Thatcher had already begun to work on her presentation on the advice of Gordon Reece, a former television producer. By chance, Reece met the actor Laurence Olivier, who arranged lessons with the National Theatre&#x27;s voice coach.

Thatcher began attending lunches regularly at the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a think tank founded by poultry magnate Antony Fisher; she had been visiting the IEA and reading its publications since the early 1960s. There she was influenced by the ideas of Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon and became the face of the ideological movement opposing the British welfare state. Keynesian economics, they believed, was weakening Britain. The institute&#x27;s pamphlets proposed less government, lower taxes, and more freedom for business and consumers.
Thatcher intended to promote neoliberal economic ideas at home and abroad. Despite setting the direction of her foreign policy for a Conservative government, Thatcher was distressed by her repeated failure to shine in the House of Commons. Consequently, Thatcher decided that as &quot;her voice was carrying little weight at home&quot;, she would &quot;be heard in the wider world&quot;. Thatcher undertook visits across the Atlantic, establishing an international profile and promoting her economic and foreign policies. She toured the United States in 1975 and met President Gerald Ford, visiting again in 1977, when she met President Jimmy Carter. Among other foreign trips, she met Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi during a visit to Iran in 1978. Thatcher chose to travel without being accompanied by her shadow foreign secretary, Reginald Maudling, in an attempt to make a bolder personal impact.

In domestic affairs, Thatcher opposed Scottish devolution (home rule) and the creation of a Scottish Assembly. She instructed Conservative MPs to vote against the Scotland and Wales Bill in December 1976, which was successfully defeated, and then when new Bills were proposed, she supported amending the legislation to allow the English to vote in the 1979 referendum on Scottish devolution.

Britain&#x27;s economy during the 1970s was so weak that then Foreign Secretary James Callaghan warned his fellow Labour Cabinet members in 1974 of the possibility of &quot;a breakdown of democracy&quot;, telling them: &quot;If I were a young man, I would emigrate.&quot; In mid-1978, the economy began to recover, and opinion polls showed Labour in the lead, with a general election being expected later that year and a Labour win a serious possibility. Now prime minister, Callaghan surprised many by announcing on 7 September that there would be no general election that year and that he would wait until 1979 before going to the polls. Thatcher reacted to this by branding the Labour government &quot;chickens&quot;, and Liberal Party leader David Steel joined in, criticising Labour for &quot;running scared&quot;.

The Labour government then faced fresh public unease about the direction of the country and a damaging series of strikes during the winter of 1978–79, dubbed the &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot;. The Conservatives attacked the Labour government&#x27;s unemployment record, using advertising with the slogan &quot;Labour Isn&#x27;t Working&quot;. A general election was called after the Callaghan ministry lost a motion of no confidence in early 1979. The Conservatives won a 44-seat majority in the House of Commons, and Thatcher became the first female British prime minister.

====&quot;Iron Lady&quot;====


In 1976, Thatcher gave her &quot;Britain Awake&quot; foreign policy speech which lambasted the Soviet Union, saying it was &quot;bent on world dominance&quot;. The Soviet Army journal &quot;Red Star&quot; reported her stance in a piece headlined &quot;Iron Lady Raises Fears&quot;, alluding to her remarks on the Iron Curtain. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; covered the &quot;Red Star&quot; article the next day, and Thatcher embraced the a week later; in a speech to Finchley Conservatives she likened it to the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s nickname &quot;&quot;. The &quot;Iron&quot; metaphor followed her throughout ever since, and would become a generic sobriquet for other strong-willed female politicians.

==Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1979–1990)==

Thatcher became prime minister on 4 May 1979. Arriving at Downing Street she said, paraphrasing the Prayer of Saint Francis:

In office throughout the 1980s, Thatcher was frequently referred to as the most powerful woman in the world.

===Domestic affairs===
====Minorities====
Thatcher was the Opposition leader and prime minister at a time of increased racial tension in Britain. During the 1977 local elections, &quot;The Economist&quot; commented: &quot;The Tory tide swamped the smaller partiesspecifically the National Front, which suffered a clear decline from last year.&quot; Her standing in the polls had risen by 11% after a 1978 interview for &quot;World in Action&quot; in which she said &quot;the British character has done so much for democracy, for law and done so much throughout the world that if there is any fear that it might be swamped people are going to react and be rather hostile to those coming in&quot;, as well as &quot;in many ways add to the richness and variety of this country. The moment the minority threatens to become a big one, people get frightened&quot;. In the 1979 general election, the Conservatives had attracted votes from the NF, whose support almost collapsed. In a July 1979 meeting with Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington and Home Secretary William Whitelaw, Thatcher objected to the number of Asian immigrants, in the context of limiting the total of Vietnamese boat people allowed to settle in the UK to fewer than 10,000 over two years.

====The Queen====

As prime minister, Thatcher met weekly with Queen Elizabeth II to discuss government business, and their relationship came under scrutiny. states:

Michael Shea, the Queen&#x27;s press secretary, in 1986 leaked stories of a deep rift to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. He said that she felt Thatcher&#x27;s policies were &quot;uncaring, confrontational and socially divisive&quot;. Thatcher later wrote: &quot;I always found the Queen&#x27;s attitude towards the work of the Government absolutely correct [...] stories of clashes between &#x27;two powerful women&#x27; were just too good not to make up.&quot;

====Economy and taxation====
Thatcher&#x27;s economic policy was influenced by monetarist thinking and economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. Together with her first chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes. She increased interest rates to slow the growth of the money supply, and thereby lower inflation; introduced cash limits on public spending and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing. Cuts to higher education led to Thatcher being the first Oxonian post-war prime minister without an honorary doctorate from Oxford University after a 738–319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.

Some Heathite Conservatives in the Cabinet, the so-called &quot;wets&quot;, expressed doubt over Thatcher&#x27;s policies. The 1981 England riots resulted in the British media discussing the need for a policy U-turn. At the 1980 Conservative Party conference, Thatcher addressed the issue directly with a speech written by the playwright Ronald Millar, that notably included the following lines:
Thatcher&#x27;s job approval rating fell to 23% by December 1980, lower than recorded for any previous prime minister. As the recession of the early 1980s deepened, she increased taxes, despite concerns expressed in a March 1981 statement signed by 364 leading economists, which argued there was &quot;no basis in economic theory [...] for the Government&#x27;s belief that by deflating demand they will bring inflation permanently under control&quot;, adding that &quot;present policies will deepen the depression, erode the industrial base of our economy and threaten its social and political stability&quot;.
By 1982, the UK began to experience signs of economic recovery; inflation was down to 8.6% from a high of 18%, but unemployment was over 3 million for the first time since the 1930s. By 1983, overall economic growth was stronger, and inflation and mortgage rates had fallen to their lowest levels in 13 years, although manufacturing employment as a share of total employment fell to just over 30%, with total unemployment remaining high, peaking at 3.3 million in 1984.

During the 1982 Conservative Party Conference, Thatcher said: &quot;We have done more to roll back the frontiers of socialism than any previous Conservative Government.&quot; She said at the Party Conference the following year that the British people had completely rejected state socialism and understood &quot;the state has no source of money other than money which people earn themselves [...] There is no such thing as public money; there is only taxpayers&#x27; money.&quot;

By 1987, unemployment was falling, the economy was stable and strong, and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead, and local council election results had also been successful, prompting Thatcher to call a general election for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. The election saw Thatcher re-elected for a third successive term.

Thatcher had been firmly opposed to British membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM, a precursor to European Economic and Monetary Union), believing that it would constrain the British economy, despite the urging of both Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe; in October 1990 she was persuaded by John Major, Lawson&#x27;s successor as chancellor, to join the ERM at what proved to be too high a rate.

Thatcher reformed local government taxes by replacing domestic rates (a tax based on the nominal rental value of a home) with the Community Charge (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident. The new tax was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year, and proved to be among the most unpopular policies of her premiership. Public disquiet culminated in a 70,000 to 200,000-strong demonstration in London in March 1990; the demonstration around Trafalgar Square deteriorated into riots, leaving 113 people injured and 340 under arrest. The Community Charge was abolished in 1991 by her successor, John Major. It has since transpired that Thatcher herself had failed to register for the tax and was threatened with financial penalties if she did not return her form.

====Industrial relations====
Thatcher believed that the trade unions were harmful to both ordinary trade unionists and the public. She was committed to reducing the power of the unions, whose leadership she accused of undermining parliamentary democracy and economic performance through strike action. Several unions launched strikes in response to legislation introduced to limit their power, but resistance eventually collapsed. Only 39% of union members voted Labour in the 1983 general election. According to the BBC&#x27;s political correspondent in 2004, Thatcher &quot;managed to destroy the power of the trade unions for almost a generation&quot;. The miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85 was the biggest and most devastating confrontation between the unions and the Thatcher government.
In March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) proposed to close 20 of the 174 state-owned mines and cut 20,000 jobs out of 187,000. Two-thirds of the country&#x27;s miners, led by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) under Arthur Scargill, went on strike in protest. However, Scargill refused to hold a ballot on the strike, having previously lost three ballots on a national strike (in January and October 1982, and March 1983). This led to the strike being declared illegal by the High Court of Justice.

Thatcher refused to meet the union&#x27;s demands and compared the miners&#x27; dispute to the Falklands War, declaring in a speech in 1984: &quot;We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands. We always have to be aware of the enemy within, which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty.&quot; Thatcher&#x27;s opponents characterised her words as indicating contempt for the working class and have been employed in criticism of her ever since.

After a year out on strike in March 1985, the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. The cost to the economy was estimated to be at least £1.5 billion, and the strike was blamed for much of the pound&#x27;s fall against the US dollar. Thatcher reflected on the end of the strike in her statement that &quot;if anyone has won&quot;, it was &quot;the miners who stayed at work&quot; and all those &quot;that have kept Britain going&quot;.

The government closed 25 unprofitable coal mines in 1985, and by 1992 a total of 97 mines had been closed; those that remained were privatised in 1994. The resulting closure of 150 coal mines, some of which were not losing money, resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and had the effect of devastating entire communities. Strikes had helped bring down Heath&#x27;s government, and Thatcher was determined to succeed where he had failed. Her strategy of preparing fuel stocks, appointing hardliner Ian MacGregor as NCB leader and ensuring that police were adequately trained and equipped with riot gear contributed to her triumph over the striking miners.

The number of stoppages across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, when more than 29 million working days had been lost. In 1984, the year of the miners&#x27; strike, there were 1,221, resulting in the loss of more than 27 million working days. Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher&#x27;s premiership; in 1990, there were 630 and fewer than 2 million working days lost, and they continued to fall thereafter. Thatcher&#x27;s tenure also witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57.3% in 1979 to 49.5% in 1985. In 1979 up until Thatcher&#x27;s final year in office, trade union membership also fell, from 13.5 million in 1979 to fewer than 10 million.

====Privatisation====
The policy of privatisation has been called &quot;a crucial ingredient of Thatcherism&quot;. After the 1983 election, the sale of state utilities accelerated; more than £29 billion was raised from the sale of nationalised industries, and another £18 billion from the sale of council houses. The process of privatisation, especially the preparation of nationalised industries for privatisation, was associated with marked improvements in performance, particularly in terms of labour productivity.

Some of the privatised industries, including gas, water, and electricity, were natural monopolies for which privatisation involved little increase in competition. The privatised industries that demonstrated improvement sometimes did so while still under state ownership. British Steel Corporation had made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed MacGregor chairmanship, which faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and halve the workforce. Regulation was also significantly expanded to compensate for the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies such as Oftel (1984), Ofgas (1986), and the National Rivers Authority (1989). There was no clear pattern to the degree of competition, regulation, and performance among the privatised industries.

In most cases, privatisation benefited consumers in terms of lower prices and improved efficiency but results overall have been mixed. Not all privatised companies have had successful share price trajectories in the longer term. A 2010 review by the IEA states: &quot;[I]t does seem to be the case that once competition and/or effective regulation was introduced, performance improved markedly [...] But I hasten to emphasise again that the literature is not unanimous.&quot;

Thatcher always resisted privatising British Rail and was said to have told Transport Secretary Nicholas Ridley: &quot;Railway privatisation will be the of this government. Please never mention the railways to me again.&quot; Shortly before her resignation in 1990, she accepted the arguments for privatisation, which her successor John Major implemented in 1994.

The privatisation of public assets was combined with financial deregulation to fuel economic growth. Chancellor Geoffrey Howe abolished the UK&#x27;s exchange controls in 1979, which allowed more capital to be invested in foreign markets, and the Big Bang of 1986 removed many restrictions on the London Stock Exchange.

====Northern Ireland====

In 1980 and 1981, Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners in Northern Ireland&#x27;s Maze Prison carried out hunger strikes to regain the status of political prisoners that had been removed in 1976 by the preceding Labour government. Bobby Sands began the 1981 strike, saying that he would fast until death unless prison inmates won concessions over their living conditions. Thatcher refused to countenance a return to political status for the prisoners, having declared &quot;Crime is crime is crime; it is not political&quot;. Nevertheless, the British government privately contacted republican leaders in a bid to bring the hunger strikes to an end. After the deaths of Sands and nine others, the strike ended. Some rights were restored to paramilitary prisoners, but not official recognition of political status. Violence in Northern Ireland escalated significantly during the hunger strikes.

Thatcher narrowly escaped injury in an IRA assassination attempt at a Brighton hotel early in the morning on 12 October 1984. Five people were killed, including the wife of minister John Wakeham. Thatcher was staying at the hotel to prepare for the Conservative Party conference, which she insisted should open as scheduled the following day. She delivered her speech as planned, though rewritten from her original draft, in a move that was supported across the political spectrum and enhanced her popularity with the public.

On 6 November 1981, Thatcher and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Garret FitzGerald had established the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Council, a forum for meetings between the two governments. On 15 November 1985, Thatcher and FitzGerald signed the Hillsborough Anglo-Irish Agreement, which marked the first time a British government had given the Republic of Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland. In protest, the Ulster Says No movement led by Ian Paisley attracted 100,000 to a rally in Belfast, Ian Gow, later assassinated by the PIRA, resigned as Minister of State in HM Treasury, and all 15 Unionist MPs resigned their parliamentary seats; only one was not returned in the subsequent by-elections on 23 January 1986.

===Environment===
Thatcher supported an active climate protection policy; she was instrumental in the passing of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the founding of the Hadley Centre for Climate Research and Prediction, the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the ratification of the Montreal Protocol on preserving the ozone.

Thatcher helped to put climate change, acid rain and general pollution in the British mainstream in the late 1980s, calling for a global treaty on climate change in 1989. Her speeches included one to the Royal Society in 1988, followed by another to the UN General Assembly in 1989.

===Foreign affairs===

Thatcher appointed Lord Carrington, an ennobled member of the party and former Secretary of State for Defence, to run the Foreign Office in 1979. Although considered a &quot;wet&quot;, he avoided domestic affairs and got along well with Thatcher. One issue was what to do with Rhodesia, where the white minority had determined to rule the prosperous, black-majority breakaway colony in the face of overwhelming international criticism. With the 1975 Portuguese collapse in the continent, South Africa (which had been Rhodesia&#x27;s chief supporter) realised that their ally was a liability; black rule was inevitable, and the Thatcher government brokered a peaceful solution to end the Rhodesian Bush War in December 1979 via the Lancaster House Agreement. The conference at Lancaster House was attended by Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith, as well as by the key black leaders: Muzorewa, Mugabe, Nkomo and Tongogara. The result was the new Zimbabwean nation under black rule in 1980.

====Cold War====
Thatcher&#x27;s first foreign-policy crisis came with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. She condemned the invasion, said it showed the bankruptcy of a détente policy and helped convince some British athletes to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics. She gave weak support to US president Jimmy Carter who tried to punish the USSR with economic sanctions. Britain&#x27;s economic situation was precarious, and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties. Thatcher nevertheless gave the go-ahead for Whitehall to approve MI6 (along with the SAS) to undertake &quot;disruptive action&quot; in Afghanistan. As well as working with the CIA in Operation Cyclone, they also supplied weapons, training and intelligence to the &quot;mujaheddin&quot;.

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported in 2011 that her government had secretly supplied Iraq under Saddam Hussein with &quot;non-lethal&quot; military equipment since 1981.

Having withdrawn formal recognition from the Pol Pot regime in 1979, the Thatcher government backed the Khmer Rouge keeping their UN seat after they were ousted from power in Cambodia by the Cambodian–Vietnamese War. Although Thatcher denied it at the time, it was revealed in 1991 that, while not directly training any Khmer Rouge, from 1983 the Special Air Service (SAS) was sent to secretly train &quot;the armed forces of the Cambodian non-communist resistance&quot; that remained loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk and his former prime minister Son Sann in the fight against the Vietnamese-backed puppet regime.

Thatcher was one of the first Western leaders to respond warmly to reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Following Reagan–Gorbachev summit meetings and reforms enacted by Gorbachev in the USSR, she declared in November 1988 that &quot;[w]e&#x27;re not in a Cold War now&quot; but rather in a &quot;new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was&quot;. She went on a state visit to the Soviet Union in 1984 and met with Gorbachev and Council of Ministers chairman Nikolai Ryzhkov.

====Ties with the US====

Despite opposite personalities, Thatcher bonded quickly with US president Ronald Reagan. She gave strong support to the Reagan administration&#x27;s Cold War policies based on their shared distrust of communism. A sharp disagreement came in 1983 when Reagan did not consult with her on the invasion of Grenada.

During her first year as prime minister, she supported NATO&#x27;s decision to deploy US nuclear cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe, permitting the US to station more than 160 cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common, starting in November 1983 and triggering mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She bought the Trident nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris, tripling the UK&#x27;s nuclear forces at an eventual cost of more than £12 billion (at 1996–97 prices). Thatcher&#x27;s preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the Westland affair of 1985–86 when she acted with colleagues to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer Westland to refuse a takeover offer from the Italian firm Agusta in favour of the management&#x27;s preferred option, a link with Sikorsky Aircraft. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who had supported the Agusta deal, resigned from the government in protest.

In April 1986 she permitted US F-111s to use Royal Air Force bases for the bombing of Libya in retaliation for the Libyan bombing of a Berlin discothèque, citing the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Polls suggested that fewer than one in three British citizens approved of her decision.

Thatcher was in the US on a state visit when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990. During her talks with President George H. W. Bush, who succeeded Reagan in 1989, she recommended intervention, and put pressure on Bush to deploy troops in the Middle East to drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. Bush was apprehensive about the plan, prompting Thatcher to remark to him during a telephone conversation: &quot;This was no time to go wobbly!&quot; Thatcher&#x27;s government supplied military forces to the international coalition in the build-up to the Gulf War, but she had resigned by the time hostilities began on 17 January 1991. She applauded the coalition victory on the backbenches, while warning that &quot;the victories of peace will take longer than the battles of war&quot;. It was disclosed in 2017 that Thatcher had suggested threatening Saddam with chemical weapons after the invasion of Kuwait.

====Crisis in the South Atlantic====

On 2 April 1982, the ruling military junta in Argentina ordered the invasion of the British Overseas Territories of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, triggering the Falklands War. The subsequent crisis was &quot;a defining moment of premiership&quot;. At the suggestion of Harold Macmillan and Robert Armstrong, she set up and chaired a small War Cabinet (formally called ODSA, Overseas and Defence committee, South Atlantic) to oversee the conduct of the war, which by 5–6 April had authorised and dispatched a naval task force to retake the islands. Argentina surrendered on 14 June and &quot;Operation Corporate&quot; was hailed a success, notwithstanding the deaths of 255 British servicemen and three Falkland Islanders. Argentine fatalities totalled 649, half of them after the nuclear-powered submarine torpedoed and sank the cruiser on 2 May.

Thatcher was criticised for the neglect of the Falklands&#x27; defence that led to the war, and especially by Labour MP Tam Dalyell in Parliament for the decision to torpedo the &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, but overall, she was considered a competent and committed war leader. The &quot;Falklands factor&quot;, an economic recovery beginning early in 1982, and a bitterly divided opposition all contributed to Thatcher&#x27;s second election victory in 1983. Thatcher frequently referred after the war to the &quot;Falklands spirit&quot;; suggests that this reflected her preference for the streamlined decision-making of her War Cabinet over the painstaking deal-making of peacetime cabinet government.

====Negotiating Hong Kong====
In September 1982, she visited China to discuss with Deng Xiaoping the sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997. China was the first communist state Thatcher had visited as prime minister, and she was the first British prime minister to visit China. Throughout their meeting, she sought the PRC&#x27;s agreement to a continued British presence in the territory. Deng insisted that the PRC&#x27;s sovereignty over Hong Kong was non-negotiable but stated his willingness to settle the sovereignty issue with the British government through formal negotiations. Both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong&#x27;s stability and prosperity. After the two-year negotiations, Thatcher conceded to the PRC government and signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing in 1984, agreeing to hand over Hong Kong&#x27;s sovereignty in 1997.

====Apartheid in South Africa====
Despite saying that she was in favour of &quot;peaceful negotiations&quot; to end apartheid, Thatcher opposed sanctions imposed on South Africa by the Commonwealth and the European Economic Community (EEC). She attempted to preserve trade with South Africa while persuading its government to abandon apartheid. This included &quot;[c]asting herself as President Botha&#x27;s candid friend&quot; and inviting him to visit the UK in 1984, despite the &quot;inevitable demonstrations&quot; against his government. Alan Merrydew of the Canadian broadcaster BCTV News asked Thatcher what her response was &quot;to a reported ANC statement that they will target British firms in South Africa?&quot; to which she later replied: &quot;[...] when the ANC says that they will target British companies [...] This shows what a typical terrorist organisation it is. I fought terrorism all my life and if more people fought it, and we were all more successful, we should not have it and I hope that everyone in this hall will think it is right to go on fighting terrorism.&quot; During his visit to Britain five months after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela praised Thatcher: &quot;She is an enemy of apartheid [...] We have much to thank her for.&quot;

====Europe====

Thatcher and her party supported British membership of the EEC in the 1975 national referendum and the Single European Act of 1986, and obtained the UK rebate on contributions, but she believed that the role of the organisation should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that the EEC approach was at odds with her views on smaller government and deregulation. Believing that the single market would result in political integration, Thatcher&#x27;s opposition to further European integration became more pronounced during her premiership and particularly after her third government in 1987. In her Bruges speech in 1988, Thatcher outlined her opposition to proposals from the EEC, forerunner of the European Union, for a federal structure and increased centralisation of decision-making:

Sharing the concerns of French president François Mitterrand, Thatcher was initially opposed to German reunification, telling Gorbachev that it &quot;would lead to a change to postwar borders, and we cannot allow that because such a development would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could endanger our security&quot;. She expressed concern that a united Germany would align itself more closely with the Soviet Union and move away from NATO.

In March 1990, Thatcher held a Chequers seminar on the subject of German reunification that was attended by members of her cabinet and historians such as Norman Stone, George Urban, Timothy Garton Ash and Gordon A. Craig. During the seminar, Thatcher described &quot;what Urban called &#x27;saloon bar clichés&#x27; about the German character, including &#x27;angst, aggressiveness, assertiveness, bullying, egotism, inferiority complex sentimentality. Those present were shocked to hear Thatcher&#x27;s utterances and &quot;appalled&quot; at how she was &quot;apparently unaware&quot; about the post-war German collective guilt and Germans&#x27; attempts to work through their past. The words of the meeting were leaked by her foreign-policy advisor Charles Powell and, subsequently, her comments were met with fierce backlash and controversy.

During the same month, German chancellor Helmut Kohl reassured Thatcher that he would keep her &quot;informed of all his intentions about unification&quot;, and that he was prepared to disclose &quot;matters which even his cabinet would not know&quot;.

===Challenges to leadership and resignation===

During her premiership, Thatcher had the second-lowest average approval rating (40%) of any post-war prime minister. Since Nigel Lawson&#x27;s resignation as chancellor in October 1989, polls consistently showed that she was less popular than her party. A self-described conviction politician, Thatcher always insisted that she did not care about her poll ratings and pointed instead to her unbeaten election record.

In December 1989, Thatcher was challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by the little-known backbench MP Sir Anthony Meyer. Of the 374 Conservative MPs eligible to vote, 314 voted for Thatcher and 33 for Meyer. Her supporters in the party viewed the result as a success and rejected suggestions that there was discontent within the party.

Opinion polls in September 1990 reported that Labour had established a 14% lead over the Conservatives, and by November, the Conservatives had been trailing Labour for 18 months. These ratings, together with Thatcher&#x27;s combative personality and tendency to override collegiate opinion, contributed to further discontent within her party.

In July 1989, Thatcher removed Geoffrey Howe as foreign secretary after he and Lawson had forced her to agree to a plan for Britain to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Britain joined the ERM in October 1990.

On 1 November 1990, Howe, by then the last remaining member of Thatcher&#x27;s original 1979 cabinet, resigned as deputy prime minister, ostensibly over her open hostility to moves towards European monetary union. In his resignation speech on 13 November, which was instrumental in Thatcher&#x27;s downfall, Howe attacked Thatcher&#x27;s openly dismissive attitude to the government&#x27;s proposal for a new European currency competing against existing currencies (a &quot;hard ECU&quot;):

On 14 November, Michael Heseltine mounted a challenge for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Opinion polls had indicated that he would give the Conservatives a national lead over Labour. Although Thatcher led on the first ballot with the votes of 204 Conservative MPs (54.8%) to 152 votes (40.9%) for Heseltine, with 16 abstentions, she was four votes short of the required 15% majority. A second ballot was therefore necessary. Thatcher initially declared her intention to &quot;fight on and fight to win&quot; the second ballot, but consultation with her cabinet persuaded her to withdraw. After holding an audience with the Queen, calling other world leaders, and making one final Commons speech, on 28 November she left Downing Street in tears. She reportedly regarded her ousting as a betrayal. Her resignation was a shock to many outside Britain, with such foreign observers as Henry Kissinger and Gorbachev expressing private consternation.

Chancellor John Major replaced Thatcher as head of government and party leader, whose lead over Heseltine in the second ballot was sufficient for Heseltine to drop out. Major oversaw an upturn in Conservative support in the 17 months leading to the 1992 general election and led the party to a fourth successive victory on 9 April 1992. Thatcher had lobbied for Major in the leadership contest against Heseltine, but her support for him waned in later years.

==Later life==

=== Return to backbenches (1990–1992) ===
After leaving the premiership, Thatcher returned to the backbenches as a constituency parliamentarian. Her domestic approval rating recovered after her resignation, though public opinion remained divided on whether her government had been good for the country. Aged 66, she retired from the House of Commons at the 1992 general election, saying that leaving the Commons would allow her more freedom to speak her mind.

===Post-Commons (1992–2003)===
On leaving the Commons, Thatcher became the first former British prime minister to set up a foundation; the British wing of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation was dissolved in 2005 due to financial difficulties. She wrote two volumes of memoirs, &quot;The Downing Street Years&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Path to Power&quot; (1995). In 1991, she and her husband Denis moved to a house in Chester Square, a residential garden square in central London&#x27;s Belgravia district.

Thatcher was hired by the tobacco company Philip Morris as a &quot;geopolitical consultant&quot; in July 1992 for $250,000 per year and an annual contribution of $250,000 to her foundation. Thatcher earned $50,000 for each speech she delivered.

Thatcher became an advocate of Croatian and Slovenian independence. Commenting on the Yugoslav Wars, in a 1991 interview for Croatian Radiotelevision, she was critical of Western governments for not recognising the breakaway republics of Croatia and Slovenia as independent and for not supplying them with arms after the Serbian-led Yugoslav Army attacked. In August 1992, she called for NATO to stop the Serbian assault on Goražde and Sarajevo to end ethnic cleansing during the Bosnian War, comparing the situation in Bosnia–Herzegovina to &quot;the barbarities of Hitler&#x27;s and Stalin&#x27;s&quot;.

She made a series of speeches in the Lords criticising the Maastricht Treaty, describing it as &quot;a treaty too far&quot; and stated: &quot;I could never have signed this treaty.&quot; She cited A. V. Dicey when arguing that, as all three main parties were in favour of the treaty, the people should have their say in a referendum.

Thatcher served as honorary chancellor of the College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia from 1993 to 2000, while also serving as chancellor of the private University of Buckingham from 1992 to 1998, a university she had formally opened in 1976 as the former education secretary.

After Tony Blair&#x27;s election as Labour Party leader in 1994, Thatcher praised Blair as &quot;probably the most formidable Labour leader since Hugh Gaitskell&quot;, adding: &quot;I see a lot of socialism behind their front bench, but not in Mr Blair. I think he genuinely has moved.&quot; Blair responded in kind: &quot;She was a thoroughly determined person, and that is an admirable quality.&quot;

In 1998, Thatcher called for the release of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet when Spain had him arrested and sought to try him for human rights violations. She cited the help he gave Britain during the Falklands War. In 1999, she visited him while he was under house arrest near London. Pinochet was released in March 2000 on medical grounds by Home Secretary Jack Straw.
At the 2001 general election, Thatcher supported the Conservative campaign, as she had done in 1992 and 1997, and in the Conservative leadership election following its defeat, she endorsed Iain Duncan Smith over Kenneth Clarke. In 2002 she encouraged George W. Bush to aggressively tackle the &quot;unfinished business&quot; of Iraq under Saddam Hussein, and praised Blair for his &quot;strong, bold leadership&quot; in standing with Bush in the Iraq War.

She broached the same subject in her &quot;&quot;, which was published in April 2002 and dedicated to Ronald Reagan, writing that there would be no peace in the Middle East until Saddam was toppled. Her book also said that Israel must trade land for peace and that the European Union (EU) was a &quot;fundamentally unreformable&quot;, &quot;classic utopian project, a monument to the vanity of intellectuals, a programme whose inevitable destiny is failure&quot;. She argued that Britain should renegotiate its terms of membership or else leave the EU and join the North American Free Trade Area.

Following several small strokes, her doctors advised her not to engage in further public speaking. In March 2002 she announced that, on doctors&#x27; advice, she would cancel all planned speaking engagements and accept no more.

On 26 June 2003, Thatcher&#x27;s husband, Sir Denis, died aged 88; his body was cremated on 3 July at Mortlake Crematorium in London.

===Final years (2003–2013)===

On 11 June 2004, Thatcher (against doctors&#x27; orders) attended the state funeral service for Ronald Reagan. She delivered her eulogy via videotape; in view of her health, the message had been pre-recorded several months earlier. Thatcher flew to California with the Reagan entourage, and attended the memorial service and interment ceremony for the president at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

In 2005, Thatcher criticised how Blair had decided to invade Iraq two years previously. Although she still supported the intervention to topple Saddam Hussein, she said that (as a scientist) she would always look for &quot;facts, evidence and proof&quot; before committing the armed forces. She celebrated her 80th birthday on 13 October at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hyde Park, London; guests included the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Alexandra and Tony Blair. Geoffrey Howe, Baron Howe of Aberavon, was also in attendance and said of his former leader: &quot;Her real triumph was to have transformed not just one party but two, so that when Labour did eventually return, the great bulk of Thatcherism was accepted as irreversible.&quot;
In 2006, Thatcher attended the official Washington memorial service to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the US. She was a guest of Vice President Dick Cheney and met Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit. In February 2007 Thatcher became the first living British prime minister to be honoured with a statue in the Houses of Parliament. The bronze statue stood opposite that of her political hero, Winston Churchill, and was unveiled on 21 February 2007 with Thatcher in attendance; she remarked in the Members&#x27; Lobby of the Commons: &quot;I might have preferred iron – but bronze will do [...] It won&#x27;t rust.&quot;

Thatcher was a public supporter of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism and the resulting Prague Process and sent a public letter of support to its preceding conference.

After collapsing at a House of Lords dinner, Thatcher, suffering low blood pressure, was admitted to St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in central London on 7 March 2008 for tests. In 2009 she was hospitalised again when she fell and broke her arm. Thatcher returned to 10 Downing Street in late November 2009 for the unveiling of an official portrait by artist Richard Stone, an unusual honour for a living former prime minister. Stone was previously commissioned to paint portraits of the Queen and Queen Mother.

On 4 July 2011, Thatcher was to attend a ceremony for the unveiling of a statue of Ronald Reagan outside the US embassy in London, but was unable to attend due to her frail health. She last attended a sitting of the House of Lords on 19 July 2010, and on 30 July 2011 it was announced that her office in the Lords had been closed. Earlier that month, Thatcher was named the most competent prime minister of the past 30 years in an Ipsos MORI poll.

Thatcher&#x27;s daughter Carol that her mother had dementia in 2005, saying &quot;Mum doesn&#x27;t read much any more because of her memory loss&quot;. In her 2008 memoir, Carol wrote that her mother &quot;could hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end&quot;. She later recounted how she was first struck by her mother&#x27;s dementia when, in conversation, Thatcher confused the Falklands and Yugoslav conflicts; she recalled the pain of needing to tell her mother repeatedly that her husband Denis was dead.

===Death and funeral (2013)===


Thatcher died on 8 April 2013, at the age of 87, after suffering a stroke. She had been staying at a suite in the Ritz Hotel in London since December 2012 after having difficulty with stairs at her Chester Square home in Belgravia. Her death certificate listed the primary causes of death as a &quot;cerebrovascular accident&quot; and &quot;repeated transient ischaemic attack&quot;; secondary causes were listed as a &quot;carcinoma of the bladder&quot; and dementia.

 were mixed across the UK, ranging from tributes lauding her as Britain&#x27;s greatest-ever peacetime prime minister to public celebrations of her death and expressions of hatred and personalised vitriol.

Details of Thatcher&#x27;s funeral had been agreed upon with her in advance. She received a ceremonial funeral, including full military honours, with a church service at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 17 April.

Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh attended her funeral, marking only the second and final time in the Queen&#x27;s reign that she attended the funeral of any of her former prime ministers, after that of Churchill, who received a state funeral in 1965.

After the service at St Paul&#x27;s, Thatcher&#x27;s body was cremated at Mortlake, where her husband&#x27;s had been cremated. On 28 September, a service for Thatcher was held in the All Saints Chapel of the Royal Hospital Chelsea&#x27;s Margaret Thatcher Infirmary. In a private ceremony, Thatcher&#x27;s ashes were interred in the hospital&#x27;s grounds, next to her husband&#x27;s.

==Legacy==

===Political impact===
Thatcherism represented a systematic and decisive overhaul of the post-war consensus, whereby the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of Keynesianism, the welfare state, nationalised industry, and close regulation of the economy, and high taxes. Thatcher generally supported the welfare state while proposing to rid it of abuses.

She promised in 1982 that the highly popular National Health Service was &quot;safe in our hands&quot;. At first, she ignored the question of privatising nationalised industries; heavily influenced by right-wing think tanks, and especially by Sir Keith Joseph, Thatcher broadened her attack. Thatcherism came to refer to her policies as well as aspects of her ethical outlook and personal style, including moral absolutism, nationalism, liberal individualism, and an uncompromising approach to achieving political goals.

Thatcher defined her political philosophy, in a major and controversial break with the one-nation conservatism of her predecessor Edward Heath, in a 1987 interview published in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Own&quot; magazine:

====Overview====
The number of adults owning shares rose from 7 per cent to 25 per cent during her tenure, and more than a million families bought their council houses, increasing from 55 per cent to 67 per cent in owner-occupiers from 1979 to 1990. The houses were sold at a discount of 33–55 per cent, leading to large profits for some new owners. Personal wealth rose by 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings. Shares in the privatised utilities were sold below their market value to ensure quick and wide sales rather than maximise national income.

The &quot;Thatcher years&quot; were also marked by periods of high unemployment and social unrest, and many critics on the left of the political spectrum fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by mass unemployment as well as her monetarist economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. Unemployment did not fall below its May 1979 level during her tenure, only falling below its April 1979 level in 1990. The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.

Speaking in Scotland in 2009, Thatcher insisted she had no regrets and was right to introduce the poll tax and withdraw subsidies from &quot;outdated industries, whose markets were in terminal decline&quot;, subsidies that created &quot;the culture of dependency, which had done such damage to Britain&quot;. Political economist Susan Strange termed the neoliberal financial growth model &quot;casino capitalism&quot;, reflecting her view that speculation and financial trading were becoming more important to the economy than industry.

Critics on the left describe her as divisive and say she condoned greed and selfishness. Leading Welsh politician Rhodri Morgan, among others, characterised Thatcher as a &quot;Marmite&quot; figure. Journalist Michael White, writing in the aftermath of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, challenged the view that her reforms were still a net benefit. Others consider her approach to have been &quot;a mixed bag&quot; and &quot; Curate&#x27;s egg&quot;.

Thatcher did &quot;little to advance the political cause of women&quot; within her party or the government. Some British feminists regarded her as &quot;an enemy&quot;. June Purvis in &quot;Women&#x27;s History Review&quot; says that, although Thatcher had struggled laboriously against the sexist prejudices of her day to rise to the top, she made no effort to ease the path for other women. Thatcher did not regard women&#x27;s rights as requiring particular attention as she did not, especially during her premiership, consider that women were being deprived of their rights. She had once suggested the shortlisting of women by default for all public appointments and proposed that those with young children should leave the workforce.
Thatcher&#x27;s stance on immigration in the late 1970s was perceived as part of a rising racist public discourse, which Martin Barker terms &quot;new racism&quot;. In opposition, Thatcher believed that the National Front (NF) was winning over large numbers of Conservative voters with warnings against floods of immigrants. Her strategy was to undermine the NF narrative by acknowledging that many of their voters had serious concerns in need of addressing. In 1978 she criticised Labour&#x27;s immigration policy to attract voters away from the NF to the Conservatives. Her rhetoric was followed by increased Conservative support at the expense of the NF. Critics on the left accused her of pandering to racism.

Many Thatcherite policies influenced the Labour Party, which returned to power in 1997 under Tony Blair. Blair rebranded the party &quot;New Labour&quot; in 1994 with the aim of increasing its appeal beyond its traditional supporters, and to attract those who had supported Thatcher, such as the &quot;Essex man&quot;. Thatcher is said to have regarded the &quot;New Labour&quot; rebranding as her greatest achievement. In contrast to Blair, the Conservative Party under William Hague attempted to distance himself and the party from Thatcher&#x27;s economic policies in an attempt to gain public approval.
Shortly after Thatcher died in 2013, Scottish first minister Alex Salmond argued that her policies had the &quot;unintended consequence&quot; of encouraging Scottish devolution. Lord Foulkes of Cumnock agreed on &quot;Scotland Tonight&quot; that she had provided &quot;the impetus&quot; for devolution. Writing for &quot;The Scotsman&quot; in 1997, Thatcher argued against devolution on the basis that it would eventually lead to Scottish independence.

====Reputation====
Thatcher&#x27;s tenure of 11 years and 209 days as British prime minister was the longest since Lord Salisbury in the late 19th century (13 years and 252 days, in three spells) and the longest continuous period in office since Lord Liverpool in the early 19th century (14 years and 305 days).

Having led the Conservative Party to victory in three consecutive general elections, twice in a landslide, she ranks among the most popular party leaders in British history regarding votes cast for the winning party; over 40 million ballots were cast in total for the party under her leadership. Her electoral successes were dubbed a &quot;historic &quot; by the British press in 1987.

Thatcher ranked highest among living persons in the 2002 BBC poll &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot;. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; deemed Thatcher one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. In 2015 she topped a poll by Scottish Widows, a major financial services company, as the most influential woman of the past 200 years; and in 2016 topped BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour Power List&quot; of women judged to have had the biggest impact on female lives over the past 70 years. In 2020, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Thatcher&#x27;s name on its list of 100 Women of the Year. She was chosen as the Woman of the Year in 1982 when the Falklands War began under her command, resulting in the British victory.

In contrast to her relatively poor average approval rating as prime minister, Thatcher has since ranked highly in retrospective opinion polling and, according to YouGov, is &quot;see[n] in overall positive terms&quot; by the British public. Just after her death in 2013, according to a poll by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, about half of the public viewed her positively while one third viewed her negatively. In a 2019 opinion poll by YouGov, most Britons rated her as Britain&#x27;s greatest post-war leader (with Churchill coming second). According to the poll, more than four in ten Britons (44%) think that Thatcher was a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;great&quot; prime minister, compared to 29% who think she was a &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;terrible&quot; one. She was voted the fourth-greatest British prime minister of the 20th century in a 2011 poll of 139 academics organised by MORI. In a 2016 University of Leeds survey of 82 academics specialising in post-1945 British history and politics, she was voted the second-greatest British prime minister after the Second World War.

===Cultural depictions===
According to theatre critic Michael Billington, Thatcher left an &quot;emphatic mark&quot; on the arts while prime minister. One of the earliest satires of Thatcher as prime minister involved satirist John Wells (as writer and performer), actress Janet Brown (voicing Thatcher) and future &quot;Spitting Image&quot; producer John Lloyd (as co-producer), who in 1979 were teamed up by producer Martin Lewis for the satirical audio album &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;, which consisted of skits and songs satirising Thatcher&#x27;s rise to power. The album was released in September 1979. Thatcher was heavily satirised on &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, and &quot;The Independent&quot; labelled her &quot;every stand-up&#x27;s dream&quot;.

Thatcher was the subject or the inspiration for 1980s protest songs. Musicians Billy Bragg and Paul Weller helped to form the Red Wedge collective to support Labour in opposition to Thatcher. Known as &quot;Maggie&quot; by supporters and opponents alike, the chant song &quot;Maggie Out&quot; became a signature rallying cry among the left during the latter half of her premiership.

Wells parodied Thatcher in several media. He collaborated with Richard Ingrams on the spoof &quot;Dear Bill&quot; letters, which ran as a column in &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine; they were also published in book form and became a West End stage revue titled &quot;Anyone for Denis?&quot;, with Wells in the role of Thatcher&#x27;s husband. It was followed by a 1982 TV special directed by Dick Clement, in which Thatcher was played by Angela Thorne.

Since her premiership, Thatcher has been portrayed in a number of television programmes, documentaries, films and plays. She was portrayed by Patricia Hodge in Ian Curteis&#x27;s long unproduced &quot;The Falklands Play&quot; (2002) and by Andrea Riseborough in the TV film &quot;The Long Walk to Finchley&quot; (2008). She is the protagonist in two films, played by Lindsay Duncan in &quot;Margaret&quot; (2009) and by Meryl Streep in &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; (2011), in which she is depicted as suffering from dementia or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She is a main character in the fourth season of &quot;The Crown&quot;, played by Gillian Anderson. Thatcher has a supporting role in the 2024 biographical film &quot;Reagan&quot;, played by Lesley-Anne Down.

==Titles, awards and honours==
Thatcher became a privy counsellor (PC) on becoming a secretary of state in 1970. She was the first woman entitled to full membership rights as an honorary member of the Carlton Club on becoming Conservative Party leader in 1975.

As prime minister, Thatcher received two honorary distinctions:
* 

Two weeks after her resignation, Thatcher was appointed Member of the Order of Merit (OM) by the Queen. Her husband Denis was made a hereditary baronet at the same time; as his wife, Thatcher was entitled to use the honorific style &quot;Lady&quot;, an automatically conferred title that she declined to use. She would be made Lady Thatcher in her own right on her subsequent ennoblement in the House of Lords.

In the Falklands, Margaret Thatcher Day has been marked each 10 January since 1992, commemorating her first visit to the Islands in January 1983, six months after the end of the Falklands War in June 1982.

Thatcher became a member of the House of Lords in 1992 with a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire. Subsequently, the College of Arms granted her use of a personal coat of arms; she was allowed to revise these arms on her appointment as Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter (LG) in 1995, the highest order of chivalry.

In the US, Thatcher received the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award from the Reagan Presidential Foundation in 1998; she was designated a patron of the Heritage Foundation in 2006, where she established the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom.

<text>In chemistry and physics, metastability is an intermediate energetic state within a dynamical system other than the system&#x27;s state of least energy.
A ball resting in a hollow on a slope is a simple example of metastability. If the ball is only slightly pushed, it will settle back into its hollow, but a stronger push may start the ball rolling down the slope. Bowling pins show similar metastability by either merely wobbling for a moment or tipping over completely. A common example of metastability in science is isomerisation. Higher energy isomers are long lived because they are prevented from rearranging to their preferred ground state by (possibly large) barriers in the potential energy.

During a metastable state of finite lifetime, all state-describing parameters reach and hold stationary values. In isolation:
*the state of least energy is the only one the system will inhabit for an indefinite length of time, until more external energy is added to the system (unique &quot;absolutely stable&quot; state);
*the system will spontaneously leave any other state (of higher energy) to eventually return (after a sequence of transitions) to the least energetic state.

The metastability concept originated in the physics of first-order phase transitions. It then acquired new meaning in the study of aggregated subatomic particles (in atomic nuclei or in atoms) or in molecules, macromolecules or clusters of atoms and molecules. Later, it was borrowed for the study of decision-making and information transmission systems.

Metastability is common in physics and chemistry – from an atom (many-body assembly) to statistical ensembles of molecules (viscous fluids, amorphous solids, liquid crystals, minerals, etc.) at molecular levels or as a whole (see Metastable states of matter and grain piles below). The abundance of states is more prevalent as the systems grow larger and/or if the forces of their mutual interaction are spatially less uniform or more diverse.

In dynamic systems (with feedback) like electronic circuits, signal trafficking, decisional, neural and immune systems, the time-invariance of the active or reactive patterns with respect to the external influences defines stability and metastability (see brain metastability below). In these systems, the equivalent of thermal fluctuations in molecular systems is the &quot;white noise&quot; that affects signal propagation and the decision-making.

==Statistical physics and thermodynamics==
Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of physics that studies the dynamics of statistical ensembles of molecules via unstable states. Being &quot;stuck&quot; in a thermodynamic trough without being at the lowest energy state is known as having kinetic stability or being kinetically persistent. The particular motion or kinetics of the atoms involved has resulted in getting stuck, despite there being preferable (lower-energy) alternatives.

===States of matter===

Metastable states of matter (also referred as metastates) range from melting solids (or freezing liquids), boiling liquids (or condensing gases) and sublimating solids to supercooled liquids or superheated liquid-gas mixtures. Extremely pure, supercooled water stays liquid below 0 °C and remains so until applied vibrations or condensing seed doping initiates crystallization centers. This is a common situation for the droplets of atmospheric clouds.

===Condensed matter and macromolecules===
Metastable phases are common in condensed matter and crystallography. This is the case for anatase, a metastable polymorph of titanium dioxide, which despite commonly being the first phase to form in many synthesis processes due to its lower surface energy, is always metastable, with rutile being the most stable phase at all temperatures and pressures.
As another example, diamond is a stable phase only at very high pressures, but is a metastable form of carbon at standard temperature and pressure. It can be converted to graphite (plus leftover kinetic energy), but only after overcoming an activation energy – an intervening hill. Martensite is a metastable phase used to control the hardness of most steel. Metastable polymorphs of silica are commonly observed. In some cases, such as in the allotropes of solid boron, acquiring a sample of the stable phase is difficult.

The bonds between the building blocks of polymers such as DNA, RNA, and proteins are also metastable. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a highly metastable molecule, colloquially described as being &quot;full of energy&quot; that can be used in many ways in biology.

Generally speaking, emulsions/colloidal systems and glasses are metastable. The metastability of silica glass, for example, is characterised by lifetimes on the order of 1098 years (as compared with the lifetime of the universe, which is thought to be around years).

Sandpiles are one system which can exhibit metastability if a steep slope or tunnel is present. Sand grains form a pile due to friction. It is possible for an entire large sand pile to reach a point where it is stable, but the addition of a single grain causes large parts of it to collapse.

The avalanche is a well-known problem with large piles of snow and ice crystals on steep slopes. In dry conditions, snow slopes act similarly to sandpiles. An entire mountainside of snow can suddenly slide due to the presence of a skier, or even a loud noise or vibration.

==Quantum mechanics==

Aggregated systems of subatomic particles described by quantum mechanics (quarks inside nucleons, nucleons inside atomic nuclei, electrons inside atoms, molecules, or atomic clusters) are found to have many distinguishable states. Of these, one (or a small degenerate set) is indefinitely stable: the ground state or global minimum.

All other states besides the ground state (or those degenerate with it) have higher energies. Of all these other states, the metastable states are the ones having lifetimes lasting at least 102 to 103 times longer than the shortest lived states of the set.

A &quot;metastable state&quot; is then long-lived (locally stable with respect to configurations of &#x27;neighbouring&#x27; energies) but not eternal (as the global minimum is). Being excited – of an energy above the ground state – it will eventually decay to a more stable state, releasing energy. Indeed, above absolute zero, all states of a system have a non-zero probability to decay; that is, to spontaneously fall into another state (usually lower in energy). One mechanism for this to happen is through tunnelling.

===Nuclear physics===
Some energetic states of an atomic nucleus (having distinct spatial mass, charge, spin, isospin distributions) are much longer-lived than others (nuclear isomers of the same isotope), e.g. technetium-99m. The isotope tantalum-180m, although being a metastable excited state, is long-lived enough that it has never been observed to decay, with a half-life calculated to be least years, over 3 million times the current age of the universe.

===Atomic and molecular physics===
Some atomic energy levels are metastable. Rydberg atoms are an example of metastable excited atomic states. Transitions from metastable excited levels are typically those forbidden by electric dipole selection rules. This means that any transitions from this level are relatively unlikely to occur. In a sense, an electron that happens to find itself in a metastable configuration is trapped there. Since transitions from a metastable state are not impossible (merely less likely), the electron will eventually decay to a less energetic state, typically by an electric quadrupole transition, or often by non-radiative de-excitation (e.g., collisional de-excitation).

This slow-decay property of a metastable state is apparent in phosphorescence, the kind of photoluminescence seen in glow-in-the-dark toys that can be charged by first being exposed to bright light. Whereas spontaneous emission in atoms has a typical timescale on the order of 10−8 seconds, the decay of metastable states can typically take milliseconds to minutes, and so light emitted in phosphorescence is usually both weak and long-lasting.

===Chemistry===
In chemical systems, a system of atoms or molecules involving a change in chemical bond can be in a metastable state, which lasts for a relatively long period of time. Molecular vibrations and thermal motion make chemical species at the energetic equivalent of the top of a round hill very short-lived. Metastable states that persist for many seconds (or years) are found in energetic &quot;valleys&quot; which are not the lowest possible valley (point 1 in illustration). A common type of metastability is isomerism.

The stability or metastability of a given chemical system depends on its environment, particularly temperature and pressure. The difference between producing a stable vs. metastable entity can have important consequences. For instances, having the wrong crystal polymorph can result in failure of a drug while in storage between manufacture and administration. The map of which state is the most stable as a function of pressure, temperature and/or composition is known as a phase diagram. In regions where a particular state is not the most stable, it may still be metastable.
Reaction intermediates are relatively short-lived, and are usually thermodynamically unstable rather than metastable. The IUPAC recommends referring to these as &quot;transient&quot; rather than metastable.

Metastability is also used to refer to specific situations in mass spectrometry and spectrochemistry.

==Electronic circuits==
A digital circuit is supposed to be found in a small number of stable digital states within a certain amount of time after an input change. However, if an input changes at the wrong moment a digital circuit which employs feedback (even a simple circuit such as a flip-flop) can enter a metastable state and take an unbounded length of time to finally settle into a fully stable digital state.

==Computational neuroscience==
Metastability in the brain is a phenomenon studied in computational neuroscience to elucidate how the human brain recognizes patterns. Here, the term metastability is used rather loosely. There is no lower-energy state, but there are semi-transient signals in the brain that persist for a while and are different than the usual equilibrium state.

==In philosophy==
Gilbert Simondon invokes a notion of metastability for his understanding of systems that rather than resolve their tensions and potentials for transformation into a single final state rather, &#x27;conserves the tensions in the equilibrium of metastability instead of nullifying them in the equilibrium of stability&#x27; as a critique of cybernetic notions of homeostasis.

<text>Mary Wollstonecraft ( , ; 27 April 175910 September 1797) was an English writer and philosopher best known for her advocacy of women&#x27;s rights. Until the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s life, which encompassed several unconventional (at the time) personal relationships, received more attention than her writing. Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and her works as important influences.

During her brief career she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children&#x27;s book. Wollstonecraft is best known for &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men but appeared to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason.

After two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. She died 11 days after giving birth to her second daughter, Mary Shelley, who became an accomplished writer and the author of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

Wollstonecraft&#x27;s widower published a &quot;Memoir&quot; (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. However, with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s advocacy of women&#x27;s equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Wollstonecraft was born on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was the second of the seven children of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft&#x27;s youth. The family&#x27;s financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft&#x27;s father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother&#x27;s bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. In a defining moment in 1784, she persuaded Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.

Two friendships shaped Wollstonecraft&#x27;s early life. The first was with Jane Arden in Beverley. The two frequently read books together and attended lectures presented by Arden&#x27;s father, a self-styled philosopher and scientist. Wollstonecraft revelled in the intellectual atmosphere of the Arden household and valued her friendship with Arden greatly, sometimes to the point of being emotionally possessive. Wollstonecraft wrote to her: &quot;I have formed romantic notions of friendship ... I am a little singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none.&quot; In some of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s letters to Arden, she reveals the volatile and depressive emotions that would haunt her throughout her life. The second and more important friendship was with Fanny (Frances) Blood, introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind.

Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck out on her own in 1778 and accepted a job as a lady&#x27;s companion to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in Bath. However, Wollstonecraft had trouble getting along with the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in &quot;Thoughts on the Education of Daughters&quot;, 1787). In 1780 she returned home upon being called back to care for her dying mother. Rather than return to Dawson&#x27;s employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to Fanny and her family throughout her life, frequently giving pecuniary assistance to Blood&#x27;s brother.

Wollstonecraft had envisioned living in a female utopia with Blood; they made plans to rent rooms together and support each other emotionally and financially, but this dream collapsed under economic realities. In order to make a living, Wollstonecraft, her sisters and Blood set up a school together in Newington Green, a Dissenting community. Blood soon became engaged and, after her marriage, moved to Lisbon, Portugal with her husband, Hugh Skeys, in hopes that it would improve her health which had always been precarious. Despite the change of surroundings Blood&#x27;s health further deteriorated when she became pregnant, and in 1785 Wollstonecraft left the school and followed Blood to nurse her, but to no avail. Moreover, her abandonment of the school led to its failure. Blood&#x27;s death devastated Wollstonecraft and was part of the inspiration for her first novel, &quot;&quot; (1788).

===&quot;The first of a new genus&quot;===

After Blood&#x27;s death in 1785, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s friends helped her obtain a position as governess to the daughters of the Anglo-Irish Kingsborough family in Ireland. Although she could not get along with Lady Kingsborough, the children found her an inspiring instructor; one of the daughters, Margaret King, would later say she &quot;had freed her mind from all superstitions&quot;. Some of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s experiences during this year would make their way into her only children&#x27;s book, &quot;Original Stories from Real Life&quot; (1788).

Frustrated by the limited career options open to respectable yet poor women—an impediment which Wollstonecraft eloquently describes in the chapter of &quot;Thoughts on the Education of Daughters&quot; entitled &quot;Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left Without a Fortune&quot;—she decided, after only a year as a governess, to embark upon a career as an author. This was a radical choice, since, at the time, few women could support themselves by writing. As she wrote to her sister Everina in 1787, she was trying to become &quot;the first of a new genus&quot;. She moved to London and, assisted by the liberal publisher Joseph Johnson, found a place to live and work to support herself. She learned French and German and translated texts, most notably &quot;Of the Importance of Religious Opinions&quot; by Jacques Necker and &quot;Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children&quot; by Christian Gotthilf Salzmann. She also wrote reviews, primarily of novels, for Johnson&#x27;s periodical, the &quot;Analytical Review&quot;. Wollstonecraft&#x27;s intellectual universe expanded during this time, not only from the reading that she did for her reviews but also from the company she kept: she attended Johnson&#x27;s famous dinners and met the radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine and the philosopher William Godwin. The first time Godwin and Wollstonecraft met, they were disappointed in each other. Godwin had come to hear Paine, but Wollstonecraft assailed him all night long, disagreeing with him on nearly every subject. Johnson himself, however, became much more than a friend; she described him in her letters as a father and a brother.

In London, Wollstonecraft lived on Dolben Street, in Southwark; an up-and-coming area following the opening of the first Blackfriars Bridge in 1769. While in London, she formed connections with members of the Blue Stockings Society and pursued a relationship with the artist Henry Fuseli, even though he was already married. She was, she wrote, enraptured by his genius, &quot;the grandeur of his soul, that quickness of comprehension, and lovely sympathy&quot;. She proposed a platonic living arrangement with Fuseli and his wife, but Fuseli&#x27;s wife was appalled, and he broke off the relationship with Wollstonecraft. After Fuseli&#x27;s rejection, Wollstonecraft decided to travel to France to escape the humiliation of the incident, and to participate in the revolutionary events that she had just celebrated in her recent &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Men&quot; (1790). She had written the &quot;Rights of Men&quot; in response to the Whig MP Edmund Burke&#x27;s politically conservative critique of the French Revolution in &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790) and it made her famous overnight. &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; was published on 1 November 1790, and so angered Wollstonecraft that she spent the rest of the month writing her rebuttal. &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke&quot; was published on 29 November 1790, initially anonymously; the second edition of &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Men&quot; was published on 18 December, and this time the publisher revealed Wollstonecraft as the author.

Wollstonecraft called the French Revolution a &quot;glorious chance to obtain more virtue and happiness than hitherto blessed our globe&quot;. Against Burke&#x27;s dismissal of the Third Estate as men of no account, Wollstonecraft wrote, &quot;Time may show, that this obscure throng knew more of the human heart and of legislation than the profligates of rank, emasculated by hereditary effeminacy&quot;. About the events of 5–6 October 1789, when the royal family was marched from Versailles to Paris by a group of angry housewives, Burke praised Queen Marie Antoinette as a symbol of the refined elegance of the , who was surrounded by &quot;furies from hell, in the abused shape of the vilest of women&quot;. Wollstonecraft by contrast wrote of the same event: &quot;Probably you [Burke] mean women who gained a livelihood by selling vegetables or fish, who never had any advantages of education&quot;.

Wollstonecraft was compared with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist Joseph Priestley and Paine, whose &quot;Rights of Man&quot; (1791) would prove to be the most popular of the responses to Burke. She pursued the ideas she had outlined in &quot;Rights of Men&quot; in &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792), her most famous and influential work. Wollstonecraft&#x27;s fame extended across the English channel, for when the French statesman Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord visited London in 1792, he visited her, during which she asked that French girls be given the same right to an education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France.

===France===
Wollstonecraft left for Paris in December 1792, and arrived about a month before Louis XVI was guillotined. Britain and France were on the brink of war when she left for Paris, and many advised her not to go. France was in turmoil. She sought out other British visitors such as Helen Maria Williams and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city. During her time in Paris, Wollstonecraft associated mostly with the moderate Girondins rather than the more radical Jacobins. It was indicative that when Archibald Hamilton Rowan, the United Irishman, encountered her in the city in 1794 it was at a post-Terror festival in honour of the moderate revolutionary leader Mirabeau, who had been a great hero for Irish and English radicals before his death in April 1791.

On 26 December 1792, Wollstonecraft saw the former king, Louis XVI, being taken to be tried before the National Assembly, and much to her own surprise, found &quot;the tears flow[ing] insensibly from my eyes, when I saw Louis sitting, with more dignity than I expected from his character, in a hackney coach going to meet death, where so many of his race have triumphed&quot;.

France declared war on Britain in February 1793. Wollstonecraft tried to leave France for Switzerland but was denied permission. The Jacobin faction increased in power, and in March the formation of the Committee of Public Safety and the Revolutionary Tribunal were symptomatic of an increasingly totalitarian regime. Life became very difficult for foreigners in France. At first, they were put under police surveillance and, to get a residency permit, had to produce six written statements from Frenchmen testifying to their loyalty to the republic. Then, on 12 April 1793, all foreigners were forbidden to leave France. Despite her sympathy for the revolution, life for Wollstonecraft become very uncomfortable, all the more so as the Girondins had lost out to the Jacobins. Some of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s French friends lost their heads to the guillotine as the Jacobins set out to annihilate their enemies.

===Gilbert Imlay, the Reign of Terror, and her first child===

Having just written the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;, Wollstonecraft was determined to put her ideas to the test, and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the French Revolution, she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet: she met and fell passionately in love with Gilbert Imlay, an American adventurer. Wollstonecraft put her own principles in practice by sleeping with Imlay even though they were not married, which was widely viewed as unacceptable behaviour for a &quot;respectable&quot; woman. Whether or not she was interested in marriage, he was not, and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealization of Imlay. Despite her rejection of the sexual component of relationships in the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;, Wollstonecraft discovered that Imlay awakened her interest in sex.

Wollstonecraft was to a certain extent disillusioned by what she saw in France, writing that the people under the republic still behaved slavishly to those who held power while the new French government remained &quot;venal&quot; and &quot;brutal&quot;. Despite her disenchantment, Wollstonecraft wrote:

I cannot yet give up the hope, that a fairer day is dawning on Europe, though I must hesitatingly observe, that little is to be expected from the narrow principle of commerce, which seems everywhere to be shoving aside &quot;the point of honour&quot; of the &quot;noblesse&quot; [nobility]. For the same pride of office, the same desire of power are still visible; with this aggravation, that, fearing to return to obscurity, after having but just acquired a relish for distinction, each hero, or philosopher, for all are dubbed with these new titles, endeavors to make hay while the sun shines.

Wollstonecraft was offended by the Jacobins&#x27; treatment of women. They refused to grant women equal rights, denounced &quot;Amazons&quot;, and made it clear that women were supposed to conform to Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s ideal of helpers to men. On 16 October 1793, Marie Antoinette was guillotined; among her charges and convictions, she was found guilty of committing incest with her son. Though Wollstonecraft disliked the former queen, she was troubled that the Jacobins would make Marie Antoinette&#x27;s alleged perverse sexual acts one of the central reasons for the French people to hate her.

As the daily arrests and executions of the Reign of Terror began, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion due to being a British subject and friendly with leading Girondins. On 31 October 1793, most Girondin leaders were guillotined; when Imlay broke the news to Wollstonecraft, she fainted. By this time, Imlay was taking advantage of the Royal Navy&#x27;s blockade of France, which had caused shortages and worsened inflation levels, by chartering ships to bring food and soap from the United States past the blockade which he could then sell at a premium in French markets. Imlay&#x27;s blockade-running gained the respect and support of some Jacobins, ensuring, as he had hoped, his freedom during the Terror. To protect Wollstonecraft from arrest, Imlay made a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her an American citizen. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many were arrested. Her sisters believed she had been imprisoned.

Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins &quot;nightmarish&quot;. There were gigantic daytime parades requiring everyone to show themselves and lustily cheer lest they be suspected of inadequate commitment to the republic, as well as nighttime police raids to arrest &quot;enemies of the republic&quot;. In a March 1794 letter to her sister Everina, Wollstonecraft wrote:

It is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind ... death and misery, in every shape of terrour, haunts this devoted country—I certainly am glad that I came to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded.

Wollstonecraft soon became pregnant by Imlay; on 14 May 1794, she gave birth to her first child, Fanny, naming her after perhaps her closest friend. Wollstonecraft was overjoyed; she wrote to a friend, &quot;My little Girl begins to suck so MANFULLY that her father reckons saucily on her writing the second part of the R[igh]ts of Woman&quot; (emphasis hers). She continued to write avidly, despite not only her pregnancy and the burdens of being a new mother alone in a foreign country, but also the growing tumult of the French Revolution. While at Le Havre in northern France, she wrote a history of the early revolution, &quot;An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution&quot;, which was published in London in December 1794. Imlay, unhappy with the domestic-minded and maternal Wollstonecraft, eventually left her. He promised that he would return to her and Fanny at Le Havre, but his delays in writing to her and his long absences convinced Wollstonecraft that he had found another woman. Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations, which most critics explain as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman, while others say they resulted from her circumstances—a foreign woman alone with an infant in the middle of a revolution that had seen good friends imprisoned or executed.

===The fall of the Jacobins and &quot;An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution&quot;===
In July 1794, Wollstonecraft welcomed the fall of the Jacobins, predicting it would be followed with a restoration of freedom of the press in France, which led her to return to Paris. In August 1794, Imlay departed for London and promised to return soon. In 1793, the British government had begun a crackdown on radicals, suspending civil liberties, imposing drastic censorship, and trying for treason anyone suspected of sympathy with the revolution, which led Wollstonecraft to fear she would be imprisoned if she returned.

The winter of 1794–1795 was the coldest winter in Europe for over a century, which reduced Wollstonecraft and her daughter Fanny to desperate circumstances. The river Seine froze that winter, which made it impossible for ships to bring food and coal to Paris, leading to widespread starvation and deaths from the cold in the city. Wollstonecraft continued to write to Imlay, asking him to return to France at once, declaring she still had faith in the revolution and did not wish to return to Britain. After she left France on 7 April 1795, she continued to refer to herself as &quot;Mrs. Imlay&quot;, even to her sisters, in order to bestow legitimacy upon her child.

The British historian Tom Furniss called &quot;An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution&quot; the most neglected of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s books. It was first published in London in 1794, but a second edition did not appear until 1989. Later generations were more interested in her feminist writings than in her account of the French Revolution, which Furniss has called her &quot;best work&quot;. Wollstonecraft was not trained as a historian, but she used all sorts of journals, letters and documents recounting how ordinary people in France reacted to the revolution. She was trying to counteract what Furniss called the &quot;hysterical&quot; anti-revolutionary mood in Britain, which depicted the revolution as due to the entire French nation&#x27;s going mad. Wollstonecraft argued instead that the revolution arose from a set of social, economic and political conditions that left no other way out of the crisis that gripped France in 1789.

&quot;An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution&quot; was a difficult balancing act for Wollstonecraft. She condemned the Jacobin regime and the Reign of Terror, but at same time she argued that the revolution was a great achievement, which led her to stop her history in late 1789 rather than write about the Terror of 1793–94. Edmund Burke had ended his &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; with reference to the events of 5–6 October 1789, when a group of women from Paris forced the French royal family from the Palace of Versailles to Paris. Burke called the women &quot;furies from hell&quot;, while Wollstonecraft defended them as ordinary housewives angry about the lack of bread to feed their families. Against Burke&#x27;s idealized portrait of Marie Antoinette as a noble victim of a mob, Wollstonecraft portrayed the queen as a femme fatale, a seductive, scheming and dangerous woman. Wollstonecraft argued that the values of the aristocracy corrupted women in a monarchy because women&#x27;s main purpose in such a society was to bear sons to continue a dynasty, which essentially reduced a woman&#x27;s value to only her womb. Moreover, Wollstonecraft pointed out that unless a queen was a queen regnant, most queens were queen consorts, which meant a woman had to exercise influence via her husband or son, encouraging her to become more and more manipulative. Wollstonecraft argued that aristocratic values, by emphasizing a woman&#x27;s body and her ability to be charming over her mind and character, had encouraged women like Marie Antoinette to be manipulative and ruthless, making the queen into a corrupted and corrupting product of the .

In &quot;Biographical Memoirs of the French Revolution&quot; (1799) the historian John Adolphus condemned Wollstonecraft&#x27;s work as a &quot;rhapsody of libellous declamations&quot; and took particular offence at her depiction of Louis XVI.

===England and William Godwin===
Seeking Imlay, Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795, but he rejected her. In May 1795, she attempted to commit suicide, probably with laudanum. Imlay saved her life, but it is unclear how. In a last attempt to win back Imlay, she embarked upon some business negotiations for him in Scandinavia, trying to locate a Norwegian captain who had absconded with silver that Imlay was trying to get past the British blockade of France. Wollstonecraft undertook this hazardous trip with only her young daughter and Marguerite, her maid. She recounted her travels and thoughts in letters to Imlay, many of which were eventually published as &quot;Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark&quot; in 1796. When she returned to England and came to the full realisation that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide for the second time, leaving a note for Imlay:


She then went out on a rainy night and &quot;to make her clothes heavy with water, she walked up and down about half an hour&quot; before jumping into the River Thames, but a stranger saw her jump and rescued her. Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, which was one of the calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.

Gradually, Wollstonecraft returned to her literary life, becoming involved with Joseph Johnson&#x27;s circle again, in particular with Mary Hays, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Sarah Siddons through William Godwin. Godwin and Wollstonecraft&#x27;s unique courtship began slowly, but it eventually became a passionate love affair. Godwin had read her &quot;Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark&quot; and later wrote that &quot;If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration.&quot; Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin was further criticized because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise &quot;Political Justice&quot;. After their marriage on 29 March 1797, Godwin and Wollstonecraft moved to 29 The Polygon, Somers Town. Godwin rented an apartment 20 doors away at 17 Evesham Buildings in Chalton Street as a study, so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by letter. By all accounts, theirs was a happy and stable, though brief, relationship.

===Birth of Mary, death===
On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second daughter, Mary. Although the delivery seemed to go well initially, the placenta broke apart during the birth and became infected; childbed fever (post-partum infection) was a common and often fatal occurrence in the 18th century. After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September. Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft, &quot;I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again.&quot; She was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church, where her tombstone reads &quot;Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;: Born 27 April 1759: Died 10 September 1797.&quot;

==Posthumous, Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;==
In January 1798 Godwin published his &quot;Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;. Although Godwin felt that he was portraying his wife with love, compassion, and sincerity, many readers were shocked that he would reveal Wollstonecraft&#x27;s illegitimate children, love affairs, and suicide attempts. The Romantic poet Robert Southey accused him of &quot;the want of all feeling in stripping his dead wife naked&quot; and vicious satires such as &quot;The Unsex&#x27;d Females&quot; were published. Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; portrays Wollstonecraft as a woman deeply invested in feeling who was balanced by his reason and as more of a religious sceptic than her own writings suggest. Godwin&#x27;s views of Wollstonecraft were perpetuated throughout the nineteenth century and resulted in poems such as by British poet Robert Browning and that by William Roscoe which includes the lines:
&lt;poem&gt;
Hard was thy fate in all the scenes of life
As daughter, sister, mother, friend, and wife;
But harder still, thy fate in death we own,
Thus mourn&#x27;d by Godwin with a heart of stone.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1851, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s remains were moved by her grandson Sir Percy Shelley, 3rd Baronet, to his family tomb in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Bournemouth.

==Legacy==

Cora Kaplan describes Wollstonecraft&#x27;s legacy as &quot;curious&quot;, and furthernotes its evolution over time: &quot;for an author-activist adept in many genres ... up until the last quarter-century Wollstonecraft&#x27;s life has been read much more closely than her writing&quot;. After the devastating effect of Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s reputation lay in tatters for nearly a century; she was pilloried by such writers as Maria Edgeworth, who patterned the &quot;freakish&quot; Harriet Freke in &quot;Belinda&quot; (1801) after her. Other novelists such as Mary Hays, Charlotte Smith, Fanny Burney, and Jane West created similar figures, all to teach a &quot;moral lesson&quot; to their readers. (Hays had been a close friend, and helped nurse her in her dying days.) 

However, the author Mary Robinson, who was associated with both Godwin and Wollstonecraft, is noted for her support and admiration for Wollstonecraft, even amidst the controversy of Godwin&#x27;s biography. In her 1799 pamphlet, &quot;Thoughts on the Condition of Women&quot;, Robinson describes Wollstonecraft as “an illustrious British female, (whose death has not been sufficiently lamented, but to whose genius posterity will render justice)”. The poet Anna Seward admired Wollstonecraft and was largely positive towards Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;, writing in 1798: “Bearing strong marks of impartial authenticity as to the character, sentiments, conduct, and destiny of a very extraordinary woman, they appear to be highly valuable.”

Jane Austen never mentioned her by name, but several of her novels contain positive allusions to Wollstonecraft&#x27;s work. The American literary scholar Anne K. Mellor notes several examples. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Mr Wickham seems to be based upon the sort of man Wollstonecraft claimed that standing armies produce, while the sarcastic remarks of protagonist Elizabeth Bennet about &quot;female accomplishments&quot; closely echo Wollstonecraft&#x27;s condemnation of these activities. The balance a woman must strike between feelings and reason in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; follows what Wollstonecraft recommended in her novel &quot;Mary&quot;, while the moral equivalence Austen drew in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; between slavery and the treatment of women in society back home tracks one of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s favourite arguments. In &quot;Persuasion&quot;, Austen&#x27;s characterization of Anne Eliot (as well as her late mother before her) as better qualified than her father to manage the family estate also echoes a Wollstonecraft thesis.

Scholar Virginia Sapiro states that few read Wollstonecraft&#x27;s works during the nineteenth century as &quot;her attackers implied or stated that no self-respecting woman would read her work&quot;. (Still, as Craciun points out, new editions of &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; appeared in the UK in the 1840s and in the US in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s.) If readers were few, then &quot;many&quot; were inspired; one such reader was Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who read &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; at age 12 and whose poem &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot; reflected Wollstonecraft&#x27;s unwavering focus on education. Lucretia Mott, a Quaker minister, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Americans who met in 1840 at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, discovered they both had read Wollstonecraft, and they agreed upon the need for (what became) the Seneca Falls Convention, an influential women&#x27;s rights meeting held in 1848. Another woman who read Wollstonecraft was George Eliot, a prolific writer of reviews, articles, novels, and translations. In 1855, she devoted an essay to the roles and rights of women, comparing Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller. Fuller was an American journalist, critic, and women&#x27;s rights activist who, like Wollstonecraft, had travelled to the Continent and had been involved in the struggle for reform (in this case the 1849 Roman Republic)—and she had a child by a man without marrying him. Wollstonecraft&#x27;s children&#x27;s tales were adapted by Charlotte Mary Yonge in 1870.

Wollstonecraft&#x27;s work was exhumed with the rise of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in the United Kingdom. First was an attempt at rehabilitation in 1879 with the publication of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;Letters to Imlay, with prefatory memoir&quot; by Charles Kegan Paul. Then followed the first full-length biography, which was by Elizabeth Robins Pennell; it appeared in 1884 as part of a series by the Roberts Brothers on famous women. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, a suffragist and later president of the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies, wrote the introduction to the centenary edition (i.e. 1892) of the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;; it cleansed the memory of Wollstonecraft and claimed her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote. By 1898, Wollstonecraft was the subject of a first doctoral thesis and its resulting book.
With the advent of the modern feminist movement, women as politically dissimilar from each other as Virginia Woolf and Emma Goldman embraced Wollstonecraft&#x27;s life story. By 1929 Woolf described Wollstonecraft—her writing, arguments, and &quot;experiments in living&quot;—as immortal: &quot;she is alive and active, she argues and experiments, we hear her voice and trace her influence even now among the living&quot;. Others, however, continued to decry Wollstonecraft&#x27;s lifestyle. A biography published in 1932 refers to recent reprints of her works, incorporating new research, and to a &quot;study&quot; in 1911, a play in 1922, and another biography in 1924. Interest in her never completely died, with full-length biographies in 1937 and 1951.

With the emergence of feminist criticism in academia in the 1960s and 1970s, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s works returned to prominence. Their fortunes reflected that of the second wave of the North American feminist movement itself; for example, in the early 1970s, six major biographies of Wollstonecraft were published that presented her &quot;passionate life in to [her] radical and rationalist agenda&quot;. 

Wollstonecraft&#x27;s work has also had an effect on feminism outside academia. The feminist artwork &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, first exhibited in 1979, features a place setting for Wollstonecraft. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a political writer and former Muslim who is critical of Islam in general and its dictates regarding women in particular, cited the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; in her autobiography &quot;Infidel&quot; and wrote that she was &quot;inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights&quot;. British writer Caitlin Moran, author of the best-selling &quot;How to Be a Woman&quot;, described herself as &quot;half Wollstonecraft&quot; to the &quot;New Yorker&quot;. She has also inspired more widely. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, the Indian economist and philosopher who first identified the missing women of Asia, draws repeatedly on Wollstonecraft as a political philosopher in &quot;The Idea of Justice&quot;.

In 2009, Wollstonecraft was selected by the Royal Mail for their &quot;Eminent Britons&quot; commemorative postage stamp issue. Several plaques have been erected to honour Wollstonecraft. A commemorative sculpture, &quot;A Sculpture for Mary Wollstonecraft&quot; by Maggi Hambling, was unveiled on 10 November 2020; it was criticized for its symbolic depiction rather than a lifelike representation of Wollstonecraft, which commentators felt represented stereotypical notions of beauty and the diminishing of women. In November 2020, it was announced that Trinity College Dublin, whose library had previously held forty busts, all of them of men, was commissioning four new busts of women, one of whom would be Wollstonecraft.

==Major works==

===Educational works===

The majority of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s early productions are about education; she assembled an anthology of literary extracts &quot;for the improvement of young women&quot; entitled &quot;The Female Reader&quot; and she translated two children&#x27;s works, Maria Geertruida van de Werken de Cambon&#x27;s &quot;Young Grandison&quot; and Christian Gotthilf Salzmann&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Morality&quot;. Her own writings also addressed the topic. In both her conduct book &quot;Thoughts on the Education of Daughters&quot; (1787) and her children&#x27;s book &quot;Original Stories from Real Life&quot; (1788), Wollstonecraft advocates educating children into the emerging middle-class ethos: self-discipline, honesty, frugality, and social contentment. Both books also emphasise the importance of teaching children to reason, revealing Wollstonecraft&#x27;s intellectual debt to the educational views of seventeenth-century philosopher John Locke. However, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his and links it to the discourse of sensibility popular at the end of the eighteenth century. Both texts also advocate the education of women, a controversial topic at the time and one which she would return to throughout her career, most notably in &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;. Wollstonecraft argues that well-educated women will be good wives and mothers and ultimately contribute positively to the nation.

===&quot;Vindications&quot;===

====&quot;Vindication of the Rights of Men&quot; (1790)====
Published in response to Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790), which was a defence of constitutional monarchy, aristocracy, and the Church of England, and an attack on Wollstonecraft&#x27;s friend, the Rev. Richard Price at the Newington Green Unitarian Church, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Men&quot; (1790) attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism. Hers was the first response in a pamphlet war that subsequently became known as the &quot;Revolution Controversy&quot;, in which Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man&quot; (1792) became the rallying cry for reformers and radicals.

Wollstonecraft attacked not only monarchy and hereditary privilege but also the language that Burke used to defend and elevate it. In a famous passage in the &quot;Reflections&quot;, Burke had lamented: &quot;I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her [Marie Antoinette] with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone.&quot; Most of Burke&#x27;s detractors deplored what they viewed as theatrical pity for the French queen—a pity they felt was at the expense of the people. Wollstonecraft was unique in her attack on Burke&#x27;s gendered language. By redefining the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in &quot;A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful&quot; (1756), she undermined his rhetoric as well as his argument. Burke had associated the beautiful with weakness and femininity and the sublime with strength and masculinity; Wollstonecraft turns these definitions against him, arguing that his theatrical &quot;tableaux&quot; turn Burke&#x27;s readers—the citizens—into weak women who are swayed by show. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia L. Johnson argues remains unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke&#x27;s defence of an unequal society founded on the passivity of women.

In her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke&#x27;s system would lead to the continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke&#x27;s false feeling.

The &quot;Rights of Men&quot; was Wollstonecraft&#x27;s first overtly political work, as well as her first feminist work; as Johnson contends, &quot;it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of &quot;Rights of Men&quot; she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career.&quot; It was this text that made her a well-known writer.

====&quot;Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792)====
&quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft argues that women ought to have an education with their position in society and then proceeds to redefine that position, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be &quot;companions&quot; to their husbands rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men. Large sections of the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; respond vitriolically to conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and educational philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who wanted to deny women an education. (Rousseau famously argues in &quot;&quot; (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men.)

Wollstonecraft states that currently many women are silly and superficial (she refers to them, for example, as &quot;spaniels&quot; and &quot;toys&quot;), but argues that this is not because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education. Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that women&#x27;s deficient educations have placed on them; she writes: &quot;Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman&#x27;s sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison.&quot; She implies that, without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, women could achieve much more.

While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: &quot;Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.&quot; Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word did not come into existence until the 1890s.

One of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s most scathing critiques in the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; is of false and excessive sensibility, particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are &quot;blown about by every momentary gust of feeling&quot; and because they are &quot;the prey of their senses&quot; they cannot think rationally. In fact, she claims, they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilization: these are not women who can help refine a civilization—a popular eighteenth-century idea—but women who will destroy it. Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other; rather, she believes that they should inform each other.

In addition to her larger philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft also lays out a specific educational plan. In the twelfth chapter of the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;, &quot;On National Education&quot;, she argues that all children should be sent to a &quot;country day school&quot; as well as given some education at home &quot;to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures.&quot; She also maintains that schooling should be co-educational, arguing that men and women, whose marriages are &quot;the cement of society&quot;, should be &quot;educated after the same model.&quot;

Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle-class, which she describes as the &quot;most natural state&quot;, and in many ways the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; is inflected by a bourgeois view of the world. It encourages modesty and industry in its readers and attacks the uselessness of the aristocracy. But Wollstonecraft is not necessarily a friend to the poor; for example, in her national plan for education, she suggests that, after the age of nine, the poor, except for those who are brilliant, should be separated from the rich and taught in another school.

===Novels===

Both of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s novels criticize what she viewed as the patriarchal institution of marriage and its deleterious effects on women. In her first novel, &quot;Mary: A Fiction&quot; (1788), the eponymous heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons; she fulfils her desire for love and affection outside marriage with two passionate romantic friendships, one with a woman and one with a man. &quot;Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman&quot; (1798), an unfinished novel published posthumously and often considered Wollstonecraft&#x27;s most radical feminist work, revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband; like Mary, Maria also finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate and a friendship with one of her keepers. Neither of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s novels depict successful marriages, although she posits such relationships in the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;. At the end of &quot;Mary&quot;, the heroine believes she is going &quot;to that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage&quot;, presumably a positive state of affairs.

Both of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s novels also critique the discourse of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end of the eighteenth century. &quot;Mary&quot; is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In &quot;The Wrongs of Woman&quot; the heroine&#x27;s indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.

Female friendships are central to both of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s novels, but it is the friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman is one of the first moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.

===&quot;Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark&quot; (1796)===
Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark&quot; is a deeply personal travel narrative. The 25 letters cover a wide range of topics, from sociological reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity to musings on her relationship with Imlay (although he is not referred to by name in the text). Using the rhetoric of the sublime, Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between the self and society. Reflecting the strong influence of Rousseau, &quot;Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark&quot; shares the themes of the French philosopher&#x27;s &quot;Reveries of a Solitary Walker&quot; (1782): &quot;the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding&quot;. While Rousseau ultimately rejects society, however, Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text.
Wollstonecraft promotes subjective experience, particularly in relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and sensibility. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft&#x27;s desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works. As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to the world with a commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.

&quot;Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark&quot; was Wollstonecraft&#x27;s most popular book in the 1790s. It sold well and was reviewed positively by most critics. Godwin wrote &quot;if ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book.&quot; It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who drew on its themes and its aesthetic.

<doc id="19836" wikidata="Q182854" url="?curid=19836" title="Molecular mass">
<text>The molecular mass () is the mass of a given molecule. Units of daltons (Da) are often used. Different molecules of the same compound may have different molecular masses because they contain different isotopes of an element. The derived quantity relative molecular mass is the unitless ratio of the mass of a molecule to the atomic mass constant (which is equal to one dalton).

The molecular mass and relative molecular mass are distinct from but related to the &quot;molar mass&quot;. The molar mass is defined as the mass of a given substance divided by the amount of the substance, and is expressed in grams per mol (g/mol). That makes the molar mass an &quot;average&quot; of many particles or molecules (potentially containing different isotopes), and the molecular mass the mass of one specific particle or molecule. The molar mass is usually the more appropriate quantity when dealing with macroscopic (weigh-able) quantities of a substance.

The definition of molecular weight is most authoritatively synonymous with relative molecular mass; however, in common practice, use of this terminology is highly variable. When the molecular weight is given with the unit Da, it is frequently as a weighted average similar to the molar mass but with different units. In molecular biology, the mass of macromolecules is referred to as their molecular weight and is expressed in kDa, although the numerical value is often approximate and representative of an average.

The terms &quot;molecular mass&quot;, &quot;molecular weight&quot;, and &quot;molar mass&quot; may be used interchangeably in less formal contexts where unit- and quantity-correctness is not needed. The molecular mass is more commonly used when referring to the mass of a single or specific well-defined molecule and less commonly than molecular weight when referring to a weighted average of a sample. Prior to the 2019 revision of the SI quantities expressed in daltons (Da) were by definition numerically equivalent to molar mass expressed in the units g/mol and were thus strictly numerically interchangeable. After the 2019 revision, this relationship is only nearly equivalent, although the difference is negligible for all practical purposes.

The molecular mass of small to medium size molecules, measured by mass spectrometry, can be used to determine the composition of elements in the molecule. The molecular masses of macromolecules, such as proteins, can also be determined by mass spectrometry; however, methods based on viscosity and light-scattering are also used to determine molecular mass when crystallographic or mass spectrometric data are not available.

== Calculation ==
Molecular masses are calculated from the atomic masses of each nuclide present in the molecule, while molar masses and relative molecular masses (molecular weights) are calculated from the standard atomic weights of each element. The standard atomic weight takes into account the isotopic distribution of the element in a given sample (usually assumed to be &quot;normal&quot;). For example, water has a molar mass of 18.0153(3) g/mol, but individual water molecules have molecular masses which range between 18.010 564 6863(15) Da (1H16O) and 22.027 7364(9) Da (2H18O).

Atomic and molecular masses are usually reported in daltons, which is defined in terms of the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon-12). However, the name &quot;unified atomic mass unit&quot; (u) is still used in common practice. Relative atomic and molecular masses as defined are dimensionless. Molar masses when expressed in g/mol have almost identical numerical values as relative atomic and molecular masses. For example, the molar mass and molecular mass of methane, whose molecular formula is CH4, are calculated respectively as follows:

The uncertainty in molecular mass reflects variance (error) in measurement not the natural variance in isotopic abundances across the globe. In high-resolution mass spectrometry the mass isotopomers 12C1H4 and 13C1H4 are observed as distinct molecules, with molecular masses of approximately 16.031 Da and 17.035 Da, respectively. The intensity of the mass-spectrometry peaks is proportional to the isotopic abundances in the molecular species. 12C 2H 1H3 can also be observed with molecular mass of 17 Da.

== Determination ==
=== Mass spectrometry ===

In mass spectrometry, the molecular mass of a small molecule is usually reported as the monoisotopic mass: that is, the mass of the molecule containing only the most common isotope of each element. This also differs subtly from the molecular mass in that the choice of isotopes is defined and thus is a single specific molecular mass out of the (perhaps many) possibilities. The masses used to compute the monoisotopic molecular mass are found in a table of isotopic masses and are not found in a typical periodic table. The average molecular mass is often used for larger molecules, since molecules with many atoms are often unlikely to be composed exclusively of the most abundant isotope of each element. A theoretical average molecular mass can be calculated using the standard atomic weights found in a typical periodic table. The average molecular mass of a very small sample, however, might differ substantially from this since a single sample average is not the same as the average of many geographically distributed samples.

=== Mass photometry ===
Mass photometry (MP) is a rapid, in-solution, label-free method of obtaining the molecular mass of proteins, lipids, sugars and nucleic acids at the single-molecule level. The technique is based on interferometric scattered light microscopy. Contrast from scattered light by a single binding event at the interface between the protein solution and glass slide is detected and is linearly proportional to the mass of the molecule. This technique can also be used to measure sample homogeneity, to detect protein oligomerisation states, and to identify complex macromolecular assemblies (ribosomes, GroEL, AAV) and protein interactions such as protein-protein interactions. Mass photometry can accurately measure molecular mass over a wide range of molecular masses (40 kDa – 5 MDa).

=== Hydrodynamic methods ===
To a first approximation, the basis for determination of molecular mass according to Mark–Houwink relations is the fact that the intrinsic viscosity of solutions (or suspensions) of macromolecules depends on volumetric proportion of the dispersed particles in a particular solvent. Specifically, the hydrodynamic size as related to molecular mass depends on a conversion factor, describing the shape of a particular molecule. This allows the apparent molecular mass to be described from a range of techniques sensitive to hydrodynamic effects, including DLS, SEC (also known as GPC when the eluent is an organic solvent), viscometry, and diffusion ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DOSY). The apparent hydrodynamic size can then be used to approximate molecular mass using a series of macromolecule-specific standards. As this requires calibration, it&#x27;s frequently described as a &quot;relative&quot; molecular mass determination method.

=== Static light scattering ===
It is also possible to determine absolute molecular mass directly from light scattering, traditionally using the Zimm method. This can be accomplished either via classical static light scattering or via multi-angle light scattering detectors. Molecular masses determined by this method do not require calibration, hence the term &quot;absolute&quot;. The only external measurement required is refractive index increment, which describes the change in refractive index with concentration.

<doc id="19838" wikidata="Q191390" url="?curid=19838" title="Metallic bonding">
<text>Metallic bonding is a type of chemical bonding that arises from the electrostatic attractive force between conduction electrons (in the form of an electron cloud of delocalized electrons) and positively charged metal ions. It may be described as the sharing of &quot;free&quot; electrons among a structure of positively charged ions (cations). Metallic bonding accounts for many physical properties of metals, such as strength, ductility, thermal and electrical resistivity and conductivity, opacity, and lustre.

Metallic bonding is not the only type of chemical bonding a metal can exhibit, even as a pure substance. For example, elemental gallium consists of covalently-bound pairs of atoms in both liquid and solid-state—these pairs form a crystal structure with metallic bonding between them. Another example of a metal–metal covalent bond is the mercurous ion ().

==History==
As chemistry developed into a science, it became clear that metals formed the majority of the periodic table of the elements, and great progress was made in the description of the salts that can be formed in reactions with acids. With the advent of electrochemistry, it became clear that metals generally go into solution as positively charged ions, and the oxidation reactions of the metals became well understood in their electrochemical series. A picture emerged of metals as positive ions held together by an ocean of negative electrons.

With the advent of quantum mechanics, this picture was given a more formal interpretation in the form of the free electron model and its further extension, the nearly free electron model. In both models, the electrons are seen as a gas traveling through the structure of the solid with an energy that is essentially isotropic, in that it depends on the square of the magnitude, &quot;not&quot; the direction of the momentum vector k. In three-dimensional k-space, the set of points of the highest filled levels (the Fermi surface) should therefore be a sphere. In the nearly-free model, box-like Brillouin zones are added to k-space by the periodic potential experienced from the (ionic) structure, thus mildly breaking the isotropy.

The advent of X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis made it possible to study the structure of crystalline solids, including metals and their alloys; and phase diagrams were developed. Despite all this progress, the nature of intermetallic compounds and alloys largely remained a mystery and their study was often merely empirical. Chemists generally steered away from anything that did not seem to follow Dalton&#x27;s laws of multiple proportions; and the problem was considered the domain of a different science, metallurgy.

The nearly-free electron model was eagerly taken up by some researchers in metallurgy, notably Hume-Rothery, in an attempt to explain why intermetallic alloys with certain compositions would form and others would not. Initially Hume-Rothery&#x27;s attempts were quite successful. His idea was to add electrons to inflate the spherical Fermi-balloon inside the series of Brillouin-boxes and determine when a certain box would be full. This predicted a fairly large number of alloy compositions that were later observed. As soon as cyclotron resonance became available and the shape of the balloon could be determined, it was found that the balloon was not spherical as the Hume-Rothery believed, except perhaps in the case of caesium. This revealed how a model can sometimes give a whole series of correct predictions, yet still be wrong in its basic assumptions.
The nearly-free electron debacle compelled researchers to modify the assumpition that ions flowed in a sea of free electrons. A number of quantum mechanical models were developed, such as band structure calculations based on molecular orbitals, and the density functional theory. These models either depart from the atomic orbitals of neutral atoms that share their electrons, or (in the case of density functional theory) departs from the total electron density. The free-electron picture has, nevertheless, remained a dominant one in introductory courses on metallurgy.

The electronic band structure model became a major focus for the study of metals and even more of semiconductors. Together with the electronic states, the vibrational states were also shown to form bands. Rudolf Peierls showed that, in the case of a one-dimensional row of metallic atoms—say, hydrogen—an inevitable instability would break such a chain into individual molecules. This sparked an interest in the general question: when is collective metallic bonding stable, and when will a localized bonding take its place? Much research went into the study of clustering of metal atoms.

As powerful as the band structure model proved to be in describing metallic bonding, it remains a one-electron approximation of a many-body problem: the energy states of an individual electron are described as if all the other electrons form a homogeneous background. Researchers such as Mott and Hubbard realized that the one-electron treatment was perhaps appropriate for strongly delocalized s- and p-electrons; but for d-electrons, and even more for f-electrons, the interaction with nearby individual electrons (and atomic displacements) may become stronger than the delocalized interaction that leads to broad bands. This gave a better explanation for the transition from localized unpaired electrons to itinerant ones partaking in metallic bonding.

==The nature of metallic bonding==
The combination of two phenomena gives rise to metallic bonding: delocalization of electrons and the availability of a far larger number of delocalized energy states than of delocalized electrons. The latter could be called electron deficiency.

===In 2D===
Graphene is an example of two-dimensional metallic bonding. Its metallic bonds are similar to aromatic bonding in benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, ovalene, etc.

===In 3D===
Metal aromaticity in metal clusters is another example of delocalization, this time often in three-dimensional arrangements. Metals take the delocalization principle to its extreme, and one could say that a crystal of a metal represents a single molecule over which all conduction electrons are delocalized in all three dimensions. This means that inside the metal one can generally not distinguish molecules, so that the metallic bonding is neither intra- nor inter-molecular. &#x27;Nonmolecular&#x27; would perhaps be a better term. Metallic bonding is mostly non-polar, because even in alloys there is little difference among the electronegativities of the atoms participating in the bonding interaction (and, in pure elemental metals, none at all). Thus, metallic bonding is an extremely delocalized communal form of covalent bonding. In a sense, metallic bonding is not a &#x27;new&#x27; type of bonding at all. It describes the bonding only as present in a &quot;chunk&quot; of condensed matter: be it crystalline solid, liquid, or even glass. Metallic vapors, in contrast, are often atomic (Hg) or at times contain molecules, such as Na2, held together by a more conventional covalent bond. This is why it is not correct to speak of a single &#x27;metallic bond&#x27;.

Delocalization is most pronounced for s- and p-electrons. Delocalization in caesium is so strong that the electrons are virtually freed from the caesium atoms to form a gas constrained only by the surface of the metal. For caesium, therefore, the picture of Cs+ ions held together by a negatively charged electron gas is very close to accurate (though not perfectly so). For other elements the electrons are less free, in that they still experience the potential of the metal atoms, sometimes quite strongly. They require a more intricate quantum mechanical treatment (e.g., tight binding) in which the atoms are viewed as neutral, much like the carbon atoms in benzene. For d- and especially f-electrons the delocalization is not strong at all and this explains why these electrons are able to continue behaving as unpaired electrons that retain their spin, adding interesting magnetic properties to these metals.

===Electron deficiency and mobility===
Metal atoms contain few electrons in their valence shells relative to their periods or energy levels. They are electron-deficient elements and the communal sharing does not change that. There remain far more available energy states than there are shared electrons. Both requirements for conductivity are therefore fulfilled: strong delocalization and partly filled energy bands. Such electrons can therefore easily change from one energy state to a slightly different one. Thus, not only do they become delocalized, forming a sea of electrons permeating the structure, but they are also able to migrate through the structure when an external electrical field is applied, leading to electrical conductivity. Without the field, there are electrons moving equally in all directions. Within such a field, some electrons will adjust their state slightly, adopting a different wave vector. Consequently, there will be more moving one way than another and a net current will result.

The freedom of electrons to migrate also gives metal atoms, or layers of them, the capacity to slide past each other. Locally, bonds can easily be broken and replaced by new ones after a deformation. This process does not affect the communal metallic bonding very much, which gives rise to metals&#x27; characteristic malleability and ductility. This is particularly true for pure elements. In the presence of dissolved impurities, the normally easily formed cleavages may be blocked and the material become harder. Gold, for example, is very soft in pure form (24-karat), which is why alloys are preferred in jewelry.

Metals are typically also good conductors of heat, but the conduction electrons only contribute partly to this phenomenon. Collective (i.e., delocalized) vibrations of the atoms, known as phonons that travel through the solid as a wave, are bigger contributors.

However, a substance such as diamond, which conducts heat quite well, is not an electrical conductor. This is not a consequence of delocalization being absent in diamond, but simply that carbon is not electron deficient.

Electron deficiency is important in distinguishing metallic from more conventional covalent bonding. Thus, we should amend the expression given above to: &quot;Metallic bonding is an extremely delocalized communal form of electron-deficient covalent bonding&quot;.

==Metallic radius==
The metallic radius is defined as one-half of the distance between the two adjacent metal ions in the metallic structure. This radius depends on the nature of the atom as well as its environment—specifically, on the coordination number (CN), which in turn depends on the temperature and applied pressure.

When comparing periodic trends in the size of atoms it is often desirable to apply the so-called Goldschmidt correction, which converts atomic radii to the values the atoms would have if they were 12-coordinated. Since metallic radii are largest for the highest coordination number, correction for less dense coordinations involves multiplying by , where 0 &lt; &lt; 1. Specifically, for CN = 4, = 0.88; for CN = 6, = 0.96, and for CN = 8, = 0.97. The correction is named after Victor Goldschmidt who obtained the numerical values quoted above.

The radii follow general periodic trends: they decrease across the period due to the increase in the effective nuclear charge, which is not offset by the increased number of valence electrons; but the radii increase down the group due to an increase in the principal quantum number. Between the 4d and 5d elements, the lanthanide contraction is observed—there is very little increase of the radius down the group due to the presence of poorly shielding f orbitals.

==Strength of the bond==
The atoms in metals have a strong attractive force between them. Much energy is required to overcome it. Therefore, metals often have high boiling points, with tungsten (5828 K) being extremely high. A remarkable exception is the elements of the zinc group: Zn, Cd, and Hg. Their electron configurations end in ...ns2, which resembles a noble gas configuration, like that of helium, more and more when going down the periodic table, because the energy differential to the empty np orbitals becomes larger. These metals are therefore relatively volatile, and are avoided in ultra-high vacuum systems.

Otherwise, metallic bonding can be very strong, even in molten metals, such as gallium. Even though gallium will melt from the heat of one&#x27;s hand just above room temperature, its boiling point is not far from that of copper. Molten gallium is, therefore, a very nonvolatile liquid, thanks to its strong metallic bonding.

The strong bonding of metals in liquid form demonstrates that the energy of a metallic bond is not highly dependent on the direction of the bond; this lack of bond directionality is a direct consequence of electron delocalization, and is best understood in contrast to the directional bonding of covalent bonds. The energy of a metallic bond is thus mostly a function of the number of electrons which surround the metallic atom, as exemplified by the embedded atom model. This typically results in metals assuming relatively simple, close-packed crystal structures, such as FCC, BCC, and HCP.

Given high enough cooling rates and appropriate alloy composition, metallic bonding can occur even in glasses, which have amorphous structures.

Much biochemistry is mediated by the weak interaction of metal ions and biomolecules. Such interactions, and their associated conformational changes, have been measured using dual polarisation interferometry.

==Solubility and compound formation==
Metals are insoluble in water or organic solvents, unless they undergo a reaction with them. Typically, this is an oxidation reaction that robs the metal atoms of their itinerant electrons, destroying the metallic bonding. However metals are often readily soluble in each other while retaining the metallic character of their bonding. Gold, for example, dissolves easily in mercury, even at room temperature. Even in solid metals, the solubility can be extensive. If the structures of the two metals are the same, there can even be complete solid solubility, as in the case of electrum, an alloy of silver and gold. At times, however, two metals will form alloys with different structures than either of the two parents. One could call these materials metal compounds. But, because materials with metallic bonding are typically not molecular, Dalton&#x27;s law of integral proportions is not valid; and often a range of stoichiometric ratios can be achieved. It is better to abandon such concepts as &#x27;pure substance&#x27; or &#x27;solute&#x27; in such cases and speak of phases instead. The study of such phases has traditionally been more the domain of metallurgy than of chemistry, although the two fields overlap considerably.

==Localization and clustering: from bonding to bonds==
The metallic bonding in complex compounds does not necessarily involve all constituent elements equally. It is quite possible to have one or more elements that do not partake at all. One could picture the conduction electrons flowing around them like a river around an island or a big rock. It is possible to observe which elements do partake: e.g., by looking at the core levels in an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum. If an element partakes, its peaks tend to be skewed.

Some intermetallic materials, e.g., do exhibit metal clusters reminiscent of molecules; and these compounds are more a topic of chemistry than of metallurgy. The formation of the clusters could be seen as a way to &#x27;condense out&#x27; (localize) the electron-deficient bonding into bonds of a more localized nature. Hydrogen is an extreme example of this form of condensation. At high pressures it is a metal. The core of the planet Jupiter could be said to be held together by a combination of metallic bonding and high pressure induced by gravity. At lower pressures, however, the bonding becomes entirely localized into a regular covalent bond. The localization is so complete that the (more familiar) H2 gas results. A similar argument holds for an element such as boron. Though it is electron-deficient compared to carbon, it does not form a metal. Instead it has a number of complex structures in which icosahedral B12 clusters dominate. Charge density waves are a related phenomenon.

As these phenomena involve the movement of the atoms toward or away from each other, they can be interpreted as the coupling between the electronic and the vibrational states (i.e. the phonons) of the material. A different such electron-phonon interaction is thought to lead to a very different result at low temperatures, that of superconductivity. Rather than blocking the mobility of the charge carriers by forming electron pairs in localized bonds, Cooper pairs are formed that no longer experience any resistance to their mobility.

==Optical properties==
The presence of an ocean of mobile charge carriers has profound effects on the optical properties of metals, which can only be understood by considering the electrons as a &quot;collective&quot;, rather than considering the states of individual electrons involved in more conventional covalent bonds.

Light consists of a combination of an electrical and a magnetic field. The electrical field is usually able to excite an elastic response from the electrons involved in the metallic bonding. The result is that photons cannot penetrate very far into the metal and are typically reflected, although some may also be absorbed. This holds equally for all photons in the visible spectrum, which is why metals are often silvery white or grayish with the characteristic specular reflection of metallic lustre. The balance between reflection and absorption determines how white or how gray a metal is, although surface tarnish can obscure the lustre. Silver, a metal with high conductivity, is one of the whitest.

Notable exceptions are reddish copper and yellowish gold. The reason for their color is that there is an upper limit to the frequency of the light that metallic electrons can readily respond to: the plasmon frequency. At the plasmon frequency, the frequency-dependent dielectric function of the free electron gas goes from negative (reflecting) to positive (transmitting); higher frequency photons are not reflected at the surface, and do not contribute to the color of the metal. There are some materials, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), that are metallic conductors (actually degenerate semiconductors) for which this threshold is in the infrared, which is why they are transparent in the visible, but good reflectors in the infrared.

For silver the limiting frequency is in the far ultraviolet, but for copper and gold it is closer to the visible. This explains the colors of these two metals. At the surface of a metal, resonance effects known as surface plasmons can result. They are collective oscillations of the conduction electrons, like a ripple in the electronic ocean. However, even if photons have enough energy, they usually do not have enough momentum to set the ripple in motion. Therefore, plasmons are hard to excite on a bulk metal. This is why gold and copper look like lustrous metals albeit with a dash of color. However, in colloidal gold the metallic bonding is confined to a tiny metallic particle, which prevents the oscillation wave of the plasmon from &#x27;running away&#x27;. The momentum selection rule is therefore broken, and the plasmon resonance causes an extremely intense absorption in the green, with a resulting purple-red color. Such colors are orders of magnitude more intense than ordinary absorptions seen in dyes and the like, which involve individual electrons and their energy states.

<text>In organic chemistry, a methyl group is an alkyl derived from methane, containing one carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms, having chemical formula (whereas normal methane has the formula ). In formulas, the group is often abbreviated as Me. This hydrocarbon group occurs in many organic compounds. It is a very stable group in most molecules. While the methyl group is usually part of a larger molecule, bonded to the rest of the molecule by a single covalent bond (), it can be found on its own in any of three forms: methanide anion (), methylium cation () or methyl radical (). The anion has eight valence electrons, the radical seven and the cation six. All three forms are highly reactive and rarely observed.

==Methyl cation, anion, and radical==

===Methyl cation===
The methylium cation () exists in the gas phase, but is otherwise not encountered. Some compounds are considered to be sources of the cation, and this simplification is used pervasively in organic chemistry. For example, protonation of methanol gives an electrophilic methylating reagent that reacts by the SN2 pathway:

Similarly, methyl iodide and methyl triflate are viewed as the equivalent of the methyl cation because they readily undergo SN2 reactions by weak nucleophiles.

The methyl cation has been detected in interstellar space.

===Methyl anion===
The methanide anion () exists only in rarefied gas phase or under exotic conditions. It can be produced by electrical discharge in ketene at low pressure (less than one torr) and its enthalpy of reaction is determined to be about 252.2 ± 3.3 kJ/mol. It is a powerful superbase; only the lithium monoxide anion () and the diethynylbenzene dianions are known to be stronger.

In discussing mechanisms of organic reactions, methyl lithium and related Grignard reagents are often considered to be salts of ; and though the model may be useful for description and analysis, it is only a useful fiction. Such reagents are generally prepared from the methyl halides:
where M is an alkali metal.

===Methyl radical===

The methyl radical has the formula . It exists in dilute gases, but in more concentrated form it readily dimerizes to ethane. It is routinely produced by various enzymes of the radical SAM and methylcobalamin varieties.

==Reactivity==
The reactivity of a methyl group depends on the adjacent substituents. Methyl groups can be quite unreactive. For example, in organic compounds, the methyl group resists attack by even the strongest acids.

===Oxidation===
The oxidation of a methyl group occurs widely in nature and industry. The oxidation products derived from methyl are hydroxymethyl group , formyl group , and carboxyl group . For example, permanganate often converts a methyl group to a carboxyl () group, e.g. the conversion of toluene to benzoic acid. Ultimately oxidation of methyl groups gives protons and carbon dioxide, as seen in combustion.

===Methylation===

Demethylation (the transfer of the methyl group to another compound) is a common process, and reagents that undergo this reaction are called methylating agents. Common methylating agents are dimethyl sulfate, methyl iodide, and methyl triflate. Methanogenesis, the source of natural gas, arises via a demethylation reaction. Together with ubiquitin and phosphorylation, methylation is a major biochemical process for modifying protein function. The field of epigenetics focuses on the influence of methylation on gene expression.

===Deprotonation===
Certain methyl groups can be deprotonated. For example, the acidity of the methyl groups in acetone () is about 1020 times more acidic than methane. The resulting carbanions are key intermediates in many reactions in organic synthesis and biosynthesis. Fatty acids are produced in this way.

===Free radical reactions===
When placed in benzylic or allylic positions, the strength of the bond is decreased, and the reactivity of the methyl group increases. One manifestation of this enhanced reactivity is the photochemical chlorination of the methyl group in toluene to give benzyl chloride.

==Chiral methyl==
In the special case where one hydrogen is replaced by deuterium (D) and another hydrogen by tritium (T), the methyl substituent becomes chiral. Methods exist to produce optically pure methyl compounds, e.g., chiral acetic acid (deuterotritoacetic acid ). Through the use of chiral methyl groups, the stereochemical course of several biochemical transformations have been analyzed.

==Rotation==

A methyl group may rotate around the axis. This is a free rotation only in the simplest cases like gaseous methyl chloride . In most molecules, the remainder R breaks the &quot;C&quot;∞ symmetry of the axis and creates a potential &quot;V&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;) that restricts the free motion of the three protons. For the model case of ethane , this is discussed under the name ethane barrier.
In condensed phases, neighbour molecules also contribute to the potential. Methyl group rotation can be experimentally studied using quasielastic neutron scattering.

==Etymology==
French chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugene Peligot, after determining methanol&#x27;s chemical structure, introduced &quot;methylene&quot; from the Greek (&quot;methy&quot;) &quot;wine&quot; and (&quot;hȳlē&quot;) &quot;wood, patch of trees&quot; with the intention of highlighting its origins, &quot;alcohol made from wood (substance)&quot;. The term &quot;methyl&quot; was derived in about 1840 by back-formation from &quot;methylene&quot;, and was then applied to describe &quot;methyl alcohol&quot; (which since 1892 is called &quot;methanol&quot;).

&quot;Methyl&quot; is the IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry term for an alkane (or alkyl) molecule, using the prefix &quot;meth-&quot; to indicate the presence of a single carbon.

<doc id="19842" wikidata="Q2318025" url="?curid=19842" title="Mild ale">
<text>Mild ale is a type of ale. Modern milds are mostly dark-coloured, with an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 3% to 3.6%, although there are lighter-hued as well as stronger milds, reaching 6% abv and higher. Mild originated in Britain in the 17th century or earlier, and originally meant a young ale, as opposed to a &quot;stale&quot; aged or old ale.

Mild experienced a sharp decline in popularity in the 1960s, and was in danger of completely disappearing, but the increase of microbreweries has led to a modest renaissance and an increasing number of milds (sometimes labelled &quot;dark&quot;) being brewed.

The Campaign for Real Ale has designated May as Mild Month. In the United States, a group of beer bloggers organised the first American Mild Month for May 2015, with forty-five participating breweries across the country.

==History==
&quot;Mild&quot; was originally used to designate any beer which was young, fresh or unaged and did not refer to a specific style of beer. Thus there was Mild Ale but also Mild Porter and even Mild Bitter Beer. These young beers were often blended with aged &quot;stale&quot; beer to improve their flavour. As the 19th century progressed public taste moved away from the aged taste; unblended young beer, mostly in the form of Mild Ale or Light Bitter Beer, began to dominate the market.

In the 19th century a typical brewery produced three or four mild ales, usually designated by a number of X marks, the weakest being X, the strongest XXXX. They were considerably stronger than the milds of today, with the gravity ranging from around 1.055 to 1.072 (about 5.5% to 7% abv). Gravities dropped throughout the late 19th century and by 1914 the weakest milds were down to about 1.045, still considerably stronger than modern versions.

The draconian measures applied to the brewing industry during the First World War had a particularly dramatic effect upon mild. As the biggest-selling beer, it suffered the largest cut in gravity when breweries had to limit the average OG of their beer to 1.030. In order to be able to produce some stronger beer - which was exempt from price controls and thus more profitable - mild was reduced to 1.025 or lower.

Modern dark mild varies from dark amber to near-black in colour and is very light-bodied. Its flavour is dominated by malt, sometimes with roasty notes derived from the use of black malt, with a subdued hop character, though there are some quite bitter examples. Most are in the range 1.030–1.036 (3–3.6% abv).

Light mild is generally similar, but paler in colour. Some dark milds are created by the addition of caramel to a pale beer.

Until the 1960s mild was the most popular beer style in England. Pockets of demand remain, particularly in the West Midlands and North West England, but it has been largely ousted by bitter and lager elsewhere. In 2002, only 1.3% of beer sold in pubs was Mild. Some brewers have found it sells better under a different name. Outside Britain, mild is virtually unknown, with the exception of New South Wales and microbreweries in North America and Scandinavia. Some notable examples are Bank&#x27;s Mild, Cain&#x27;s Dark Mild, Highgate Dark Mild, Brain&#x27;s Dark, Moorhouse&#x27;s Black Cat and Theakston Traditional Mild.

==Brown and mild==
A popular drink in the West Midlands, &quot;brown and mild&quot; (also known as a &quot;boilermaker&quot;) is a half pint of draught mild served mixed with a half pint of bottled brown ale in a pint glass. In North West England, a mixture of half a pint of mild and half a pint of bitter is known as a &quot;mixed&quot;. In Norfolk, the same mixture was called a pint of &quot;twos&quot;, while the same drink in the West Midlands was called a &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;.

==Brewing==
Mild ales are generally based on mild malt or pale malt. Most milds contain, in addition, a quantity of crystal malt; dark milds, meanwhile, make use of chocolate malt, black malt or dark brewing sugars. Milds tend to be lightly hopped compared to pale ale and are usually low in alcohol; strong mild ales used to reach six or seven per cent abv, but very few such beers are still brewed. Sarah Hughes Dark Ruby Mild, brewed to a pre-World War I recipe, is a rare example of a strong Mild (6.0% ABV).

As part of the first American Mild Month, the project organizers challenged participating breweries to create a new variation on the mild ale style by brewing with American malts and hops. They defined American Mild as &quot;a restrained, darkish ale, with gentle hopping and a clean finish so that the malt and what hops are present, shine through&quot;.

<text>The Mars Society is a nonprofit organization that advocates for human exploration and colonization of Mars. It was founded by Robert Zubrin in 1998 and its principles are based on Zubrin&#x27;s Mars Direct philosophy, which aims to make human missions to Mars as feasible as possible. The Mars Society generates interest in the Mars program by garnering support from the public and through lobbying. Many current and former Mars Society members are influential in the wider spaceflight community, such as Buzz Aldrin and Elon Musk. 

Since its founding, the Mars Society has organized events and research activities. It has hosted its annual International Mars Society Convention and operated research projects such as the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station and the Mars Desert Research Station, both using Mars analog habitats. Both of the stations are placed in remote locations for research. Crew members perform simulated extravehicular activities, carry out research assignments and reside at the station on strictly rationed supplies. The organization also hosts a college robotics competition in Utah called the University Rover Challenge.

==Structure==
The Mars Society is a 501(c)(3)-eligible nonprofit organization that is funded by donations and operated by volunteers. Membership to the Mars Society is available to all on payment of a small fee. The society&#x27;s aims are garnering public support for human Mars missions, lobbying government and space agencies, and verifying mission proposals via Mars analog habitats. These goals were set out in the &quot;Founding Declaration of the Mars Society&quot;.

The Mars Society&#x27;s founder and current president is Robert Zubrin. Notable current and former members of the organization include Buzz Aldrin, Elon Musk, Gregory Benford and James Cameron. The society is a member of the Alliance for Space Development and has chapters in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and many other countries. Since its foundation in 1998, the society organizes the annual International Mars Society Convention, with presentations primarily about Mars exploration and colonization.

In the 2019 filing to the Internal Revenue Service, the Mars Society reported to receive around US$400,000 in donations per year. Some noteworthy expenses include the annual Mars Society convention (US$58,800), the Mars Desert Research Station (US$200,000), and the University Rover Challenge (US$46,500). The Mars Society&#x27;s Taxpayer Identification Number is 31-1585646.

==Philosophy and propositions==
Many of the Mars Society&#x27;s members believe that a human mission to Mars is achievable within a decade (as laid out in Zubrin&#x27;s Mars Direct) and such a mission would lay the foundation for the colonization of Mars. The Mars Direct philosophy has permeated through the society&#x27;s lobbying efforts. During testimony to the 2009 Augustine Commission, a panel set up by the Obama administration to outline the future of the U.S. space program, Zubrin advocated initiating a lean human Mars program in a similar manner to Mars Direct. The committee was indifferent to the testimony; in the final report, the commission concluded that a human Mars mission in general would &quot;demand decades of investment and carry considerable safety risk to humans&quot;.

In 2005, Robert Markley, a science fiction researcher, pointed out that Zubrin used his president of the Mars Society position to espouse his own views on how human missions to Mars should be carried out. To make the Mars Direct plan appealing to the American public, he compared Mars to the Great American Frontier and the colonization of Mars as a way to resolve social stagnation and &quot;Hobbesian despair&quot; on Earth. Mars would be a way to give birth to an ideal society. In effect, Markley commented, Zubrin has created an &quot;interplanetary vision of manifest destiny&quot;. Most members of the Mars Society agreed with the less extreme version of Zubrin&#x27;s ideal, in that colonizing Mars is critical for preventing a dystopian future for humankind.

Oliver Morton commented in 2003 that the Mars Society is a fundamentally &quot;utopian and escapist organization&quot;. He observed that many Mars Society convention participants were unhappy with government space programs. As a consequence, they favored funding alternatives that are often impractical, such as sponsorship deals, private philanthropy, and Martian bonds (on the basis of future resources and profits). Markley commented in 2005 that the Mars Society is somewhat similar to the Royal Society at its founding in the 17th century: &quot;as much of a social club of enthusiasts as a professional scientific organization&quot;, with influences from science fiction. In a way, he continued, the Mars Direct plan provided a grand vision for future Martian endeavors to follow and the Mars Society is a platform for exploring the implications of Mars colonization.

==Background and founding==
The forerunner of the Mars Society was a small network of space enthusiasts colloquially known as the Mars Underground, which emerged around 1978. The members of this network were frustrated by the U.S. administration&#x27;s lack of attention to Mars exploration. Most members belonging to the group were researchers and graduate students, which included Chris McKay, Penelope Boston, Tom Meyer, Carol Stoker, and Carter Emmart. This is part of the reason some Mars Society members held environmentalism and counterculture ideals. In April 1981, the Mars Underground organized the first Case for Mars convention about Mars exploration at the University of Colorado. The Case for Mars conventions were held every three years until the sixth and final one in 1996.

At the now-defunct aerospace company Martin Marietta, Robert Zubrin – who had attended the third Case for Mars convention in 1987 – and engineer David Baker developed the human Mars mission plan, titled Mars Direct. They published their plan for NASA and the public to review in early 1990. The core tenet of the Mars Direct plan is to use existing technologies and eliminate the need for dangerous space rendezvous or an expensive space station. A modified Mars Direct plan (called NASA Design Reference Mission 3.0) was budgeted by NASA at ; less than one-twentieth the cost of the Mars mission plan in NASA&#x27;s Space Exploration Initiative ().

In 1996, Zubrin published &quot;The Case For Mars&quot;, the same year as the last Case for Mars convention took place. The book criticized prior Mars exploration mission proposals for being too costly and complicated, proposed an alternative mission plan based on the Mars Direct plan, gave philosophical arguments for it and rebutted criticisms of the plan.

The Mars Society was founded by Zubrin on 13 August 1998 during the Mars Society&#x27;s first convention in Boulder, Colorado, the same place where the first Case for Mars convention took place 17 years earlier. With a duration of four days, the convention was attended by 750 persons and can be seen as a successor to the prior Case for Mars conventions. Some of those invited were from the Mars Underground or had written to Zubrin about &quot;The Case For Mars&quot;. The Mars Society&#x27;s founding convention in August 1998 emphasized its focus on the Mars Direct plan and efforts of lobbying the government, holding that there was no technical reason that would prevent a human mission to Mars within a decade. The first convention saw the signing of the &quot;Founding Declaration of the Mars Society&quot; which outlined primary goals for the society, amidst rifts between Mars Society members&#x27; Martian ideals. 

On the second day of the convention, there was an intense debate about the ethics of Mars terraforming, which science writer Oliver Morton described as &#x27;rancorous&#x27;. The moderator of the debate was Chris McKay. On one side of the debate were Zubrin and a few other people, who championed that terraforming is the end goal of Mars colonization. On the other side of the debate, the audience reminded them that for life on Mars, the act of terraforming will be similar to that of Native American genocide. The terms &quot; and &#x27;manifest destiny&#x27; used by the Zubrin side were prohibited in later conventions. The next few conventions organized additional debates between proponents of nuclear power/terraforming and environmentalists.

==Past activities==
In mid-2001, the Mars Society received a check from Elon Musk at a fundraiser event. After briefly researching Mars concepts and missions, Musk joined the Mars Society&#x27;s board of directors and gave it . In August 2001, Musk left the Mars Society after a meeting with its members and established a temporary foundation for his publicity projects, despite pleas for collaboration from Zubrin. In a public presentation at the 4th Mars Society convention, Musk stated that the Mars Society might have a purpose in his efforts. By April 2002, Musk had abandoned the temporary foundation entirely; instead, he founded SpaceX to build a low-cost rocket and invited aerospace engineers whom he had met at Mars Society-sponsored trips. In the following years, Musk kept in contact with the Mars Society, as is evident in his presentation of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2008, his acceptance of the Mars Pioneer Award from the society in 2012 and his presentation at the society&#x27;s 2020 convention.

After the first convention, the Mars Society decided to construct a Mars analog facility named Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) on Devon Island, Nunavut, Canada. The FMARS is the second Mars analog facility in the world; the first one is the Haughton–Mars Project. Some of FMARS&#x27;s construction cost was paid by the Mars Society and the Haughton–Mars Project team. Other funding came from commercial sponsorship, such as with the Discovery Channel. FMARS was first occupied during a test run in July and August 2000. It began the first simulated mission around 2001. The money donated by Elon Musk was spent on the next Mars analog habitat, called the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS). In December 2001, the habitat&#x27;s construction near Hanksville, Utah, was completed.

From 2001 to 2005, Mars mission simulations in FMARS were around 2–8 weeks long and consisted of ten rotated crews. The first four-month-long mock mission took place in 2007, which revealed cultural conflicts and inadequate coping strategies. Shorter missions were carried out in 2009 and 2013, before another long-duration mission called Mars 160 was conducted in 2017, in collaboration with the MDRS. The crew stayed in MDRS for eighty days before being transferred to FMARS, rotating the crew every month. As of April 2020, the MDRS had hosted nineteen field seasons (one per year) totaling 236 crews, with each crew consisting of six or seven members.

The society also formulated plans to launch space-based experiments, which never materialized. In 2001, after a discussion between Zubrin, Musk and the board members, the Mars Society announced the Translife Mission, later renamed to the Mars Gravity Biosatellite. The mission aimed to study the effect of Martian-level gravity on mice, with satellite construction supported by students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Georgia Tech. In August 2008, the Mars Society announced the project TEMPO3 after a preliminary selection of proposals. TEMPO3 was conceived as a system of two CubeSats attached to a tether and spun with carbon dioxide-powered thrusters, aimed to demonstrate rotational artificial gravity system in space. Neither of these proposals were built: the Mars Gravity Biosatellite was canceled in June 2009 due to a lack of funding and no further development of TEMPO3 has been reported since the initial proposal.

At the Mars Society&#x27;s 2015 convention, a debate was organized between two representatives of Mars One (CEO Bas Lansdorp and Barry Finger) and two researchers from MIT (Sydney Do and Andrew Owens). Mars One, a now-defunct non-profit organization founded in 2011, aimed to establish a human settlement on Mars through a one-way mission called Mars to Stay. The MIT researchers criticized the plan as infeasible and suicidal. According to Dwayne A. Day from &quot;The Space Review&quot;, the MIT team won the debate by making specific and realistic arguments. He also noted that the popularity of Mars One had dwarfed that of the Mars Society, stating that the perceived absurdness of Mars One may potentially be detrimental to the Mars Society&#x27;s reputation.

In 2021, around a week before the first crewed New Shepard mission, Blue Origin donated US$1 million to the Mars Society and 18 other space-related organizations. The donation money came from a seat auction in that New Shepard flight. The donation vastly exceeded the Mars Society annual revenue, which was reported to be less than $400,000 in a filing with the Internal Revenue Service.

==Current projects==
The Mars Society&#x27;s premier project is the Mars Analog Research Station Program. The program aims to further the understanding of Mars missions&#x27; technical and human factors via its two Mars analog habitats: the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) and the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS). The FMARS is located on Devon Island in Canada and near the Haughton impact crater, above the 75th parallel north where the island is uninhabited and barren. The MDRS is located near Hanksville, Utah, where the habitat is isolated from civilization. Both stations&#x27; locations are chosen for the landscape similarities with Mars. Because these stations are meant for research, both FMARS and MDRS are closed to public visits. These stations are staffed by volunteers with degrees in planetary science, geology, and engineering.

The Mars Society has plans to build additional analog stations. The Euro-MARS, operated by the Mars Society&#x27;s European chapter, was intended to have three decks and more extensive facilities. However, during transport from the United Kingdom to the deploying location at Krafla, Iceland, the Euro-MARS sustained irreparable damage. It was reported in 2017 that Euro-MARS was back at the planning phase, but no further updates about the station are available. The Mars Society is also planning to build another Mars analog station in Arkaroola, Australia, as of October 2022. The station would replicate a spacecraft launching directly from the Earth&#x27;s surface, featuring a mock propulsion module, heat shield and landing engines.

As well as research, the Mars Society organizes the Rover Challenge Series, a group of annual university competitions for making mock Martian rovers. Around May and June each year, the three-day University Rover Challenge takes place in Utah&#x27;s desert near the MDRS where teams compete in exploration tasks. The rover&#x27;s operators must only use sensor data for navigation, similar to actual Martian rovers. Similar regional competitions that belong to the Rover Challenge Series include the European Rover Challenge, the Canadian International Rover Challenge and the Indian Rover Challenge.

MarsVR Project is a virtual reality program that simulates MDRS and terrain one square mile around the base. The program was made in collaboration with a local virtual reality company. MarsVR is used to train MDRS&#x27;s crews by simulating the use of spacesuits, airlocks, rovers and activities such as cooking. The software can also simulate playing sports on Mars such as soccer and mountaineering. The exploration portion of MarsVR is free to download on Steam, however, the training part has an attached cost for the public.

In 2023, the Mars Society established the non-profit Mars Technology Institute and the corresponding C corporation Mars Technology Lab to research solutions for labor, agriculture, and energy problems in the colonization of Mars. The Institute plans to outsource research to universities before building its own campus.

<text>Minerva (; ; ) is the Roman goddess of wisdom, justice, law, victory, and the sponsor of arts, trade, and strategy. She is also a goddess of warfare, though with a focus on strategic warfare, rather than the violence of gods such as Mars. Beginning in the second century BC, the Romans equated her with the Greek goddess Athena. Minerva is one of the three Roman deities in the Capitoline Triad, along with Jupiter and Juno.

Minerva is a virgin goddess. Her domain includes music, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, weaving, and the crafts. Minerva is often depicted with her sacred creature, an owl usually named the &quot;owl of Minerva&quot;. which symbolised her association with wisdom and knowledge, as well as, less frequently, the snake and the olive tree. Minerva is commonly depicted as tall with an athletic and muscular build. She is often wearing armour and carrying a spear. As an important Roman goddess, she is highly revered, honored, and respected. Marcus Terentius Varro considered her to be ideal and the plan for the universe personified.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Minerva&quot; stems from Proto-Italic (&quot;intelligent, understanding&quot;), and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) (&quot;thought&quot;). Helmut Rix (1981) and Gerhard Meiser (1998) have proposed the PIE derivative (&quot;provided with a mind, intelligent&quot;) as the transitional form.

== Origin ==
The myth of Minerva&#x27;s birth follows that of Athena. Jupiter raped the titaness Metis, which resulted in her attempting to change shape (or shapeshift) to escape him. Jupiter then recalled the prophecy that his own child would overthrow him, just as he himself had overthrown his father Saturn, and in turn, Saturn had overthrown his father Caelus. Fearing that their child would be male, and would grow stronger than he was and rule the Heavens in his place, Jupiter swallowed Metis whole after tricking her into turning herself into a fly. The Titaness gave birth to Minerva and forged weapons and armour for her child while within Jupiter&#x27;s body. The constant pounding and ringing left Jupiter with agonizing pain. To relieve the pain, Vulcan used a hammer to split Jupiter&#x27;s head and, from the cleft, Minerva emerged, as a grown adult and in full battle armour.

== Presence in mythology ==
Minerva is a prominent figure in Roman mythology. She appears in many famous myths. Many of the stories of her Greek counterpart Athena are attributed to Minerva in Roman mythology, such as that of the naming of Athens resulting from a competition between Minerva and Neptune, in which Minerva created the olive tree.

=== Minerva and Arachne ===
Arachne was a mortal highly proficient in weaving and embroidery. Not only were her finished works beautiful, but also her process, so much so that nymphs would come out of their natural environments to watch her work. Arachne boasted that her skills could beat those of Minerva, and if she were wrong she would pay the price for it. This angered Minerva, and she took the form of an old woman to approach Arachne, offering her a chance to take back her challenge and ask forgiveness. When Arachne refused, Minerva rid herself of her disguise and took Arachne up on her challenge. Arachne began to weave a tapestry that showed the shortcomings of the gods, while Minerva depicted her competition with Neptune and the gods looking down with disgust on mortals who would dare to challenge them. Minerva&#x27;s weaving was meant as a final warning to her foe to back down. Minerva was insulted by the scenes that Arachne was weaving, and destroyed it. She then touched Arachne on the forehead, which made her feel shame for what she had done, leading her to hang herself. Minerva then felt bad for the woman, and brought her back to life. However, Minerva transformed her into a spider as punishment for her actions, and hanging from a web would forever be a reminder to Arachne of her actions that offended the gods. This story also acted as a warning to mortals not to challenge the gods.

=== Minerva and Medusa ===
Medusa was once a beautiful human girl with magnificent hair, she was also a priestess of Minerva. Neptune was obsessed with her and lusted after her. One day Neptune was watching her pray in the Temple of Minerva and decided to act upon his lustful obsession. He forced himself on Medusa but she was not strong enough to fight him off. Minerva was furious this took place in her temple and she turned Medusa into a monster, replacing her hair with hissing snakes and removing her charm. Medusa turned any living creature she looked upon into stone. Neptune was not ever confronted for his wrongdoings to Medusa. When Perseus approached Medusa he used her reflection in his shield to avoid contact with her eyes, and then beheaded her. Medusa’s spilt blood gave birth to Pegasus; which Minerva immediately tamed and gifted to Bellerophon. He delivered the severed head to Minerva, who placed its image on her Aegis.

=== Taming of Pegasus ===
When Perseus beheaded Medusa some of the blood spilled onto the ground, and from it came Pegasus. Minerva caught the horse and tamed it before gifting the horse to the Muses. It was a kick from the hoof of Pegasus that opened the fountain Hippocrene. When Bellerophon later went to fight the Chimera he sought to use Pegasus in the fight. In order to do this he slept in Minerva&#x27;s temple, and she came to him with a golden bridle. When Pegasus saw Bellerophon with the bridle the horse immediately allowed Bellerophon to mount, and they defeated the Chimera.
=== Turning Aglauros to stone ===
Metamorphoses by Ovid tell the story of Minerva and Aglauros. When Mercury comes to seduce mortal virgin Herse, her sister Aglauros is driven by her greed to help him. Minerva discovers this and is furious with Aglauros. She seeks the assistance of Envy, who fills Aglauros with so much envy for the good fortune of others that she turns to stone. Mercury fails to seduce Herse.

=== Minerva and Hercules ===
Minerva assisted the hero Hercules. In Hyginus&#x27; &quot;Fabulae&quot; she is said to have helped him kill the Hydra (30.3).

=== Minerva and Ulysses ===
Minerva assisted the hero Ulysses. Hyginus describes in his work &quot;Fabulae&quot; that Minerva changes Odysseus&#x27; appearance in order to protect and assist him multiple times (126).

=== Inventing the flute ===
Minerva is thought to have invented the flute by piercing holes into boxwood. She enjoyed the music, but became embarrassed by how it made her face look when her cheeks puffed out to play. Because of this she threw it away and it landed on a riverbank where it was found by a satyr.

==Worship in Rome and Italy==


The Romans celebrated her festival from March 19 to March 23 during the day that is called, in the neuter plural, Quinquatria, the fifth day after the Ides of March, the nineteenth, an artisans&#x27; holiday. This festival was of deepest importance to artists and craftsmen as she was the patron goddess of crafting and arts. According to Ovid (Fasti 3.809) the festival was 5 days long, and the first day was said to be the anniversary of Minerva&#x27;s birth, so no blood was to be shed. The following four days were full of games of &quot;drawn swords&quot; in honour of Minerva&#x27;s military association. Suetonius tells us (Life of Domitian 4.4) that Domitian celebrated the Quinquatria by appointing a college of priests who were to stage plays and animal games in addition to poetry and oratory competitions. A lesser version, the &quot;Minusculae Quinquatria&quot;, was held on the Ides of June, June 13, by the flute-players, as Minerva was thought to have invented the flute. In 207 BC, a guild of poets and actors was formed to meet and make votive offerings at the temple of Minerva on the Aventine Hill. Among others, its members included Livius Andronicus. The Aventine sanctuary of Minerva continued to be an important center of the arts for much of the middle Roman Republic.

As &quot;Minerva Medica&quot;, she was the goddess of medicine and physicians. As &quot;Minerva Achaea&quot;, she was worshipped at Lucera in Apulia where votive gifts and arms said to be those of Diomedes were preserved in her temple.

According to the Acta Arvalia, a cow was sacrificed to Minerva on October 13 58 AD along with many other sacrifices to celebrate the anniversary of Nero coming to power. On January 3 81 AD, as a part of the New Year vows, two cows were sacrificed to Minerva (among many others) to secure the well-being of the emperor Titus, Domitian Caesar, Julia Augusta, and their children. On January 3 87 AD there is again record of a cow being sacrificed to Minerva among the many sacrifices made as a part of the New Year vows.

In &quot;Fasti&quot; III, Ovid called her the &quot;goddess of a thousand works&quot; due to all of the things she was associated with. Minerva was worshipped throughout Italy, and when she eventually became equated with the Greek goddess Athena, she also became a goddess of battle. Unlike Mars, god of war, she was sometimes portrayed with sword lowered, in sympathy for the recent dead, rather than raised in triumph and battle lust. In Rome her bellicose nature was emphasized less than elsewhere.

According to Livy&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot; (7.3), the annual nail marking the year, a process where the praetor maximus drove a nail in to formally keep track of the current year, happened in the temple of Minerva because she was thought to have invented numbers.

There is archaeological evidence to suggest that Minerva was worshipped not only in a formal civic fashion, but also by individuals on a more personal level.

===Roman coinage===
Minerva is featured on the coinage of different Roman emperors. She often is represented on the reverse side of a coin holding an owl and a spear among her attributes.

== Worship in Roman Britain ==
During the Roman occupation of Britain, it was common for carpenters to own tools ornamented with images of Minerva to invoke a greater amount of protection from the goddess of crafts. Some women would also have images of her on accessories such as hairpins or jewellery. She was even featured on some funerary art on coffins and signet rings.

=== Bath ===
During Roman rule, Minerva became equated with the Celtic goddess Sulis, to the degree where their names were used both together and interchangeably. She was believed to preside over the healing hot springs located in Bath. Though Minerva is not a water deity, her association with intellectual professions as &quot;Minerva Medica&quot; she could also be thought of as a healing goddess, the epigraphic evidence present makes it clear that this is how Minerva was thought of in Bath.

Some of the archaeological evidence present in Bath leads scholars to believe that it was thought Minerva could provide full healing from things such as rheumatism via the hot springs if she was given full credit for the healing.

The temple of Sulis Minerva was known for having a miraculous altar-fire that burned coal as opposed to the traditional wood.

=== Carrawburgh ===
There is evidence of worship of Minerva Medica in Carrawburgh due to archaeological evidence such as a relief depicting her and Aesculapius.

=== Chester ===
There is a shrine dedicated to Minerva in Edgar&#x27;s Field built in the face of a quarry next to the River Dee.

==Etruscan Menrva==

Stemming from an Italic moon goddess (&#x27;She who measures&#x27;), the Etruscans adopted the inherited Old Latin name, , thereby calling her Menrva. It is presumed that her Roman name, Minerva, is based on this Etruscan mythology. Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, war, art, schools, justice and commerce. She was the Etruscan counterpart to Greek Athena. Like Athena, Minerva burst from the head of her father, Jupiter (Greek Zeus), who had devoured her mother (Metis) in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent her birth.

By a process of folk etymology, the Romans could have linked her foreign name to the root &quot;men-&quot; in Latin words such as &quot;mens&quot; meaning &quot;mind&quot;, perhaps because one of her aspects as goddess pertained to the intellectual. The word &quot;mens&quot; is built from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*men-&quot; &#x27;mind&#x27; (linked with memory as in Greek Mnemosyne/μνημοσύνη and /μνῆστις: memory, remembrance, recollection, in Sanskrit meaning mind).

The Etruscan Menrva was part of a holy triad with Tinia and Uni, equivalent to the Roman Capitoline Triad of Jupiter-Juno-Minerva.

=== Literature ===

She is remembered in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature. Poet Elizabeth Carter is famously portrayed in an outfit inspired by Minerva, and also wrote poems in her honour.

<text>Mars Direct is a proposal for a human mission to Mars which purports to be both cost-effective and possible with current technology. It was originally detailed in a research paper by Martin Marietta engineers Robert Zubrin and David Baker in 1990, and later expanded upon in Zubrin&#x27;s 1996 book &quot;The Case for Mars&quot;. It now serves as a staple of Zubrin&#x27;s speaking engagements and general advocacy as head of the Mars Society, an organization devoted to the colonization of Mars.

==History==

===Space Exploration Initiative===

On July 20, 1989, US President George H. W. Bush announced plans for what came to be known as the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI). In a speech on the steps of the National Air and Space Museum he described long-term plans which would culminate in a human mission to the surface of Mars.

By December 1990, a study to estimate the project&#x27;s cost determined that long-term expenditure would total approximately 450 billion dollars spread over 20 to 30 years. The &quot;90 Day Study&quot; as it came to be known (also “90 Day Report” from people such as Zubrin), evoked a hostile Congressional reaction towards SEI given that it would have required the largest single government expenditure since World War II. Within a year, all funding requests for SEI had been denied.

Dan Goldin became NASA Administrator on April 1, 1992, officially abandoning plans for near-term human exploration beyond Earth orbit with the shift towards a &quot;faster, better, cheaper&quot; strategy for robotic exploration.

===Development===

While working at Martin Marietta designing interplanetary mission architectures, Robert Zubrin perceived a fundamental flaw in the SEI program. Zubrin came to understand that if NASA&#x27;s plan was to fully utilize as many technologies as possible in support of sending the mission to Mars, it would become politically untenable. In his own words:

The exact opposite of the correct way to do engineering.

Zubrin&#x27;s alternative to this &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; mission strategy (dubbed so by its detractors for the large, nuclear powered spaceships that supposedly resembled the science-fiction spaceship of the same name) involved a longer surface stay, a faster flight-path in the form of a conjunction class mission, in situ resource utilization and craft launched directly from the surface of Earth to Mars as opposed to be being assembled in orbit or by a space-based drydock. After receiving approval from management at Marietta, a 12-man team within the company began to work out the details of the mission. While they focused primarily on more traditional mission architectures, Zubrin began to collaborate with colleague David Baker&#x27;s extremely simple, stripped-down and robust strategy. Their goal to &quot;use local resources, travel light, and live off the land&quot; became the hallmark of Mars Direct.

==Mission scenario==

===First launch===

The first flight of the Ares rocket (not to be confused with the similarly named rocket of the now defunct Constellation program) would take an uncrewed Earth Return Vehicle to Mars after a 6-month cruise phase, with a supply of hydrogen, a chemical plant and a small nuclear reactor. Once there, a series of chemical reactions (the Sabatier reaction coupled with electrolysis) would be used to combine a small amount of hydrogen (8 tons) carried by the &quot;Earth Return Vehicle&quot; with the carbon dioxide of the Martian atmosphere to create up to 112 tonnes of methane and oxygen. This relatively simple chemical-engineering procedure was used regularly in the 19th and 20th centuries, and would ensure that only 7% of the return propellant would need to be carried to the surface of Mars.

96 tonnes of methane and oxygen would be needed to send the &quot;Earth Return Vehicle&quot; on a trajectory back home at the conclusion of the surface stay; the rest would be available for Mars rovers. The process of generating fuel is expected to require approximately ten months to complete.

===Second launch===

Some 26 months after the &quot;Earth Return Vehicle&quot; is originally launched from Earth, a second vehicle, the Mars Habitat Unit, would be launched on a 6-month long low-energy transfer trajectory to Mars, and would carry a crew of four astronauts (the minimum number required so that the team can be split in two without leaving anyone alone). The Habitat Unit would not be launched until the automated factory aboard the ERV had signaled the successful production of chemicals required for operation on the planet and the return trip to Earth. During the trip, artificial gravity would be generated by tethering the Habitat Unit to the spent upper stage of the booster, and setting them rotating about a common axis. This rotation would produce a comfortable 1 &quot;g&quot; working environment for the astronauts, freeing them of the debilitating effects of long-term exposure to weightlessness.

====Landing and surface operations====

Upon reaching Mars, the upper stage would be jettisoned, with the Habitat Unit aerobraking into Mars orbit before soft-landing in proximity to the &quot;Earth Return Vehicle&quot;. Precise landing would be supported by a radar beacon started by the first lander. Once on Mars, the crew would spend 18 months on the surface, carrying out a range of scientific research, aided by a small rover vehicle carried aboard their Mars Habitat Unit, and powered by the methane produced by the Earth Return Vehicle.

====Return and follow-up missions====

To return, the crew would use the &quot;Earth Return Vehicle&quot;, leaving the Mars Habitat Unit for the possible use of subsequent explorers. On the return trip to Earth, the propulsion stage of the Earth Return Vehicle would be used as a counterweight to generate artificial gravity for the trip back.

Follow-up missions would be dispatched at 2 year intervals to Mars to ensure that a redundant ERV would be on the surface at all times, waiting to be used by the next crewed mission or the current crew in an emergency. In such an emergency scenario, the crew would trek hundreds of kilometers to the other ERV in their long-range vehicle.

==Components==

The Mars Direct proposal includes a component for a Launch Vehicle &quot;Ares&quot;, an Earth Return Vehicle (ERV) and a Mars Habitat Unit (MHU).

===Launch Vehicle===

The plan involves several launches making use of heavy-lift boosters of similar size to the Saturn V used for the Apollo missions, which would potentially be derived from Space Shuttle components. This proposed rocket is dubbed &quot;Ares&quot;, which would use space shuttle Advanced Solid Rocket Boosters, a modified shuttle external tank, and a new Lox/LH2 third stage for the trans-Mars injection of the payload. Ares would put 121 tonnes into a 300 km circular orbit, and boost 47 tonnes toward Mars.

===Earth Return Vehicle===

The Earth Return Vehicle is a two-stage vehicle. The upper stage comprises the living accommodation for the crew during their six-month return trip to Earth from Mars. The lower stage contains the vehicle&#x27;s rocket engines and a small chemical production plant.

===Mars Habitat Unit===

The Mars Habitat Unit is a 2- or 3-deck vehicle providing a comprehensive living and working environment for a Mars crew. In addition to individual sleeping quarters which provide a degree of privacy for each of the crew and a place for personal effects, the Mars Habitat Unit includes a communal living area, a small galley, exercise area, and hygiene facilities with closed-cycle water purification. The lower deck of the Mars Habitat Unit provides the primary working space for the crew: small laboratory areas for carrying out geology and life science research; storage space for samples, airlocks for reaching the surface of Mars, and a suiting-up area where crew members prepare for surface operations. Protection from harmful radiation while in space and on the surface of Mars (e.g. from solar flares) would be provided by a dedicated &quot;storm shelter&quot; in the core of the vehicle.

The Mars Habitat Unit would also include a small pressurized rover that is stored in the lower deck area and assembled on the surface of Mars. Powered by a methane engine, it is designed to extend the range over which astronauts can explore the surface of Mars out to 320 km.

Since it was first proposed as a part of Mars Direct, the Mars Habitat Unit has been adopted by NASA as a part of their Mars Design Reference Mission, which uses two Mars Habitat Units – one of which flies to Mars uncrewed, providing a dedicated laboratory facility on Mars, together with the capacity to carry a larger rover vehicle. The second Mars Habitat Unit flies to Mars with the crew, its interior given over completely to living and storage space.

To prove the viability of the Mars Habitat Unit, the Mars Society has implemented the Mars Analogue Research Station Program (MARS), which has established a number of prototype Mars Habitat Units around the world.

== Reception ==

Baker pitched Mars Direct at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in April 1990, where reception was very positive. The engineers flew around the country to present their plan, which generated significant interest. When their tour culminated in a demonstration at the National Space Society they received a standing ovation. The plan gained rapid media attention shortly afterwards.

Resistance to the plan came from teams within NASA working on the Space Station and advanced propulsion concepts. The NASA administration rejected Mars Direct. Zubrin remained committed to the strategy, and after parting with David Baker attempted to convince the new NASA administration of Mars Direct&#x27;s merits in 1992.

After being granted a small research fund at Martin Marietta, Zubrin and his colleagues successfully demonstrated an in-situ propellant generator which achieved an efficiency of 94%. No chemical engineers partook in the development of the demonstration hardware. After showing the positive results to the Johnson Space Center, the NASA administration still held several reservations about the plan.

In November 2003, Zubrin was invited to speak to the U.S. Senate committee on the future of space exploration. Two months later the Bush administration announced the creation of the Constellation program, a human spaceflight initiative with the goal of sending humans to the Moon by 2020. While a Mars mission was not specifically detailed, a plan to reach Mars based on utilizing the Orion spacecraft was tentatively developed for implementation in the 2030s. In 2009 the Obama administration began a review of the Constellation program, and after budgetary concerns the program was cancelled in 2010.

There are a variety of psychological and sociological issues that could affect long-duration expeditionary space missions. Early human spaceflight missions to Mars are expected by some to have significant psycho-social problems to overcome, as well as provide considerable data for refining mission design, mission planning, and crew selection for future missions.

==Revisions==
Since Mars Direct was initially conceived, it has undergone regular review and development by Zubrin himself, the Mars Society, NASA, Stanford University and others.

===Mars Semi-Direct===

Zubrin and Weaver developed a modified version of Mars Direct, called Mars Semi-Direct, in response to some specific criticisms. This mission consists of three spacecraft and includes a &quot;Mars Ascent Vehicle&quot; (MAV). The ERV remains in Mars orbit for the return journey, while the uncrewed MAV lands and manufactures propellants for the ascent back up to Mars orbit. The Mars Semi-Direct architecture has been used as the basis of a number of studies, including the NASA Design Reference Missions.

When subjected to the same cost-analysis as the 90-day report, Mars Semi-Direct was predicted to cost 55 billion dollars over 10 years, capable of fitting into the existing NASA budget.

Mars Semi-Direct became the basis of the Design Reference Mission 1.0 of NASA, replacing the Space Exploration Initiative.

===Design Reference Mission===
The NASA model, referred to as the Design Reference Mission, on version 5.0 as of September 1, 2012, calls for a significant upgrade in hardware (at least three launches per mission, rather than two), and sends the ERV to Mars fully fueled, parking it in orbit above the planet for subsequent rendezvous with the MAV.

===Mars Direct and SpaceX===

With the potentially imminent advent of low-cost heavy lift capability, Zubrin has posited a dramatically lower cost human Mars mission using hardware developed by space transport company SpaceX. In this simpler plan, a crew of two would be sent to Mars by a single Falcon Heavy launch, the Dragon spacecraft acting as their interplanetary cruise habitat. Additional living space for the journey would be enabled through the use of inflatable add-on modules if required. The problems associated with long-term weightlessness would be addressed in the same manner as the baseline Mars Direct plan, a tether between the Dragon habitat and the TMI (Trans-Mars Injection) stage acting to allow rotation of the craft.

The Dragon&#x27;s heatshield characteristics could allow for a safe descent if landing rockets of sufficient power were made available. Research at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center has demonstrated that a robotic Dragon would be capable of a fully propulsive landing on the Martian surface. On the surface, the crew would have at their disposal two Dragon spacecraft with inflatable modules as habitats, two ERVs, two Mars ascent vehicles and 8 tonnes of cargo.

===Other Studies===

The Mars Society and Stanford studies retain the original two-vehicle mission profile of Mars Direct, but increase the crew size to six.

Mars Society Australia developed their own four-person &quot;Mars Oz&quot; reference mission, based on Mars Semi-Direct. This study uses horizontally landing, bent biconic shaped modules, and relies on solar power and chemical propulsion throughout, where Mars Direct and the DRMs used nuclear reactors for surface power and, in the case of the DRMs for propulsion as well. The Mars Oz reference mission also differs in assuming, based on space station experience, that spin gravity will not be required.

==Mars Analogue Research Stations==
The Mars Society has argued the viability of the Mars Habitat Unit concept through their Mars Analogue Research Station program. These are two or three decked vertical cylinders ~8 m in diameter and 8 m high. Mars Society Australia plans to build its own station based on the Mars Oz design. The Mars Oz design features a horizontal cylinder 4.7 m in diameter and 18 m long, with a tapered nose. A second similar module will function as a garage and power and logistics module.

Mars Direct was featured on a Discovery Channel programs &quot;Mars: The Next Frontier&quot; in which issues were discussed surrounding NASA funding of the project, and on &quot;Mars Underground&quot;, where the plan is discussed more in-depth.

==Alternatives==
&quot;Mars to Stay&quot; proposals involve not returning the first immigrant/explorers immediately, or ever. It has been suggested the cost of sending a four or six person team could be one fifth to one tenth the cost of returning that same four or six person team. Depending on the specific approach taken, a quite complete lab could be sent and landed for less than the cost of sending back even 50 kilos of Martian rocks. Twenty or more persons could be sent for the cost of returning four.

<doc id="19848" wikidata="Q9021" url="?curid=19848" title="Max Planck">
<text>Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (; ; 23 April 1858 – 4 October 1947) was a German theoretical physicist whose discovery of energy quanta won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918.

Planck made many substantial contributions to theoretical physics, but his fame as a physicist rests primarily on his role as the originator of quantum theory and one of the founders of modern physics, which revolutionized understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. He is known for the Planck constant, which is of foundational importance for quantum physics, and which he used to derive a set of units, today called Planck units, expressed only in terms of fundamental physical constants.

Planck was twice president of the German scientific institution Kaiser Wilhelm Society. In 1948, it was renamed the Max Planck Society (Max-Planck-Gesellschaft) and nowadays includes 83 institutions representing a wide range of scientific directions.

== Early life and education ==

Planck came from a traditional, intellectual family. His paternal great-grandfather and grandfather were both theology professors in Göttingen; his father was a law professor at the University of Kiel and Munich. One of his uncles was also a judge.

Planck was born in 1858 in Kiel, Holstein (now Schleswig-Holstein), to Johann Julius Wilhelm Planck and his second wife, Emma Patzig. He was baptized with the name of &quot;Karl Ernst Ludwig Marx Planck&quot;; of his given names, &quot;Marx&quot; was indicated as the &quot;appellation name&quot;. However, by the age of ten he signed with the name &quot;Max&quot; and used this for the rest of his life.

He was the sixth child in the family, though two of his siblings were from his father&#x27;s first marriage. War was common during Planck&#x27;s early years and among his earliest memories was the marching of Prussian and Austrian troops into Kiel during the Second Schleswig War in 1864. In 1867 the family moved to Munich, and Planck enrolled in the Maximilians gymnasium school. There, his mathematical talents emerged early and he later came under the tutelage of Hermann Müller, a mathematician who took an interest in the youth, and taught him astronomy and mechanics as well as mathematics. It was from Müller that Planck first learned the principle of conservation of energy. Planck graduated early, at age 17. This is how Planck first came in contact with the field of physics.

Planck was gifted when it came to music. He took singing lessons and played piano, organ and cello, and composed songs and operas. However, instead of music he chose to study physics.

Planck enrolled at the University of Munich in 1874. Under professor Philipp von Jolly&#x27;s supervision, Planck performed the only experiments of his scientific career, studying the diffusion of hydrogen through heated platinum, but transferred to theoretical physics. Jolly advised Planck against going into theoretical physics. Planck recalls that in 1878, Jolly argued that physics was almost complete, being a &quot;highly developed, nearly fully matured science, that through the crowning achievement of the discovery of the principle of conservation of energy will arguably soon take its final stable form&quot;. 

In 1877, he went to the Friedrich Wilhelms University in Berlin for a year of study with physicists Hermann von Helmholtz and Gustav Kirchhoff and mathematician Karl Weierstrass. He wrote that Helmholtz was never quite prepared, spoke slowly, miscalculated endlessly, and bored his listeners, while Kirchhoff spoke in carefully prepared lectures which were dry and monotonous. He soon became close friends with Helmholtz. While there he undertook a program of mostly self-study of Rudolf Clausius&#x27;s writings, which led him to choose thermodynamics as his field.

In October 1878, Planck passed his qualifying exams and in February 1879 defended his dissertation &quot;Über den zweiten Hauptsatz der mechanischen Wärmetheorie&quot; (&quot;On the Second Law of Mechanical Heat Theory&quot;). He briefly taught mathematics and physics at his former school in Munich.

By the year 1880, Planck had obtained the two highest academic degrees offered in Europe. The first was a doctorate degree after he completed his paper detailing his research and theory of thermodynamics. He then presented his thesis called &quot;Gleichgewichtszustände isotroper Körper in verschiedenen Temperaturen&quot; (&quot;Equilibrium states of isotropic bodies at different temperatures&quot;), which earned him a habilitation.

== Career ==

With the completion of his habilitation thesis, Planck became an unpaid Privatdozent (German academic rank comparable to lecturer/assistant professor) in Munich, waiting until he was offered an academic position. Although he was initially ignored by the academic community, he furthered his work on the field of heat theory and discovered one after another the same thermodynamical formalism as Gibbs without realizing it. Clausius&#x27;s ideas on entropy occupied a central role in his work.

In April 1885, the University of Kiel appointed Planck as associate professor of theoretical physics. Further work on entropy and its treatment, especially as applied in physical chemistry, followed. He published his &quot;Treatise on Thermodynamics&quot; in 1897. He proposed a thermodynamic basis for Svante Arrhenius&#x27;s theory of electrolytic dissociation.

In 1889, he was named the successor to Kirchhoff&#x27;s position at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin – presumably thanks to Helmholtz&#x27;s intercession – and by 1892 became a full professor. In 1907 Planck was offered Ludwig Boltzmann&#x27;s position in Vienna, but turned it down to stay in Berlin. During 1909, as a University of Berlin professor, he was invited to become the Ernest Kempton Adams Lecturer in Theoretical Physics at Columbia University in New York City. A series of his lectures were translated and co-published by Columbia University professor A. P. Wills. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1914. He retired from Berlin on 10 January 1926, and was succeeded by Erwin Schrödinger. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1926 and the American Philosophical Society in 1933.

=== Professor at Berlin University ===
As a professor at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin, Planck joined the local Physical Society. He later wrote about this time: &quot;In those days I was essentially the only theoretical physicist there, whence things were not so easy for me, because I started mentioning entropy, but this was not quite fashionable, since it was regarded as a mathematical spook&quot;. Thanks to his initiative, the various local Physical Societies of Germany merged in 1898 to form the German Physical Society (Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, DPG); from 1905 to 1909 Planck was the president.

Planck started a six-semester course of lectures on theoretical physics, &quot;dry, somewhat impersonal&quot; according to Lise Meitner, &quot;using no notes, never making mistakes, never faltering; the best lecturer I ever heard&quot; according to an English participant, James R. Partington, who continues: &quot;There were always many standing around the room. As the lecture-room was well heated and rather close, some of the listeners would from time to time drop to the floor, but this did not disturb the lecture.&quot; Planck did not establish an actual &quot;school&quot;; the number of his graduate students was only about 20, among them:
* 1897 Max Abraham (1875–1922)
* 1903 Max von Laue (1879–1960)
* 1904 Moritz Schlick (1882–1936)
* 1906 Walther Meissner (1882–1974)
* 1907 Fritz Reiche (1883–1960)
* 1912 Walter Schottky (1886–1976)
* 1914 Walther Bothe (1891–1957)

=== Entropy ===
Thermodynamics, also known as the &quot;mechanical theory of heat&quot; at the end of the 19th century, had emerged at the beginning of this century from an attempt to understand the functioning of steam engines and to improve their efficiency. In the 1840s, several researchers independently discovered and formulated the law of conservation of energy, which is now also known as the first law of thermodynamics. In 1850, Rudolf Clausius formulated the so-called second law of thermodynamics, which states that a voluntary (or spontaneous) transfer of energy is only possible from a warmer to a colder body, but not vice versa. In England at this time William Thomson came to the same conclusion.

Clausius generalized his formulation further and further and came up with a new formulation in 1865. To this end, he introduced the concept of Entropy, which he defined as a measure of the reversible supply of heat in relation to the absolute temperature.

The new formulation of the second law, which is still valid today, was: &quot;Entropy can be created, but never destroyed&quot;. Clausius, whose work Planck read as a young student during his stay in Berlin, successfully applied this new law of nature to mechanical, thermoelectric and chemical processes.

In his dissertation in 1879, Planck summarized Clausius&#x27; writings, pointing out contradictions and inaccuracies in their formulation and then clarifying them. In addition, he generalized the validity of the second law to all processes in nature, Clausius had limited its application to reversible processes and thermal processes. Furthermore, Planck dealt intensively with the new concept of entropy and emphasized, that entropy is not only a property of a physical system, but at the same time a measure of the irreversibility of a process: If entropy is generated in a process, it is irreversible, since entropy cannot be destroyed according to the second law. In reversible processes, the entropy remains constant. He presented this fact in detail in 1887 in a series of treatises entitled &quot;On the Princip of the Increase of Entropy&quot;.

In his study of the concept of entropy, Planck did not follow the molecular, probabilistic interpretation that prevailed at the time, as these do not provide absolute proof of universality. Instead, he pursued a phenomenological approach and was also skeptical of atomism. Even though he later abandoned this attitude in the course of his work on the law of radiation, his early work impressively shows the possibilites of thermodynamics in solving concrete physicochemical problems.

Planck&#x27;s understanding of entropy included the realization that the maximum of entropy corresponds to the equilibrium state. The accompanying conclusion that knowledge of the Entropy allows all laws of thermodynamic equilibrium states to be derived corresponds to the modern understanding of such states. Planck therefore chose equilibrium processes as his research focus and, based on his habilitation thesis, researched the coexistence of aggregate states and the equilibrium of gas reactions, for example. This work on the frontier of chemical thermodynamics also received great attention due to the rapidly expanding chemical work at that time.

Independently of Planck, Josiah Willard Gibbs had also discovered almost all the knowledge Planck gained about the properties of physicochemical equilibria and published them from 1876 onwards. Planck was unaware of these essays, and they did not appear in German until 1892. However, both scientists approached the topic in different ways, while Planck dealt with irreversible processes, Gibbs looked at equilibria. This approach was finally able to prevail because of its simplicity, but Planck&#x27;s approach is attributed the greater universality.

=== Black-body radiation ===

In 1894, Planck turned his attention to the problem of black-body radiation. The problem had been stated by Kirchhoff in 1859: &quot;how does the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body (a perfect absorber, also known as a cavity radiator) depend on the frequency of the radiation (i.e., the color of the light) and the temperature of the body?&quot;. The question had been explored experimentally, but no theoretical treatment had agreed with the experimentally observed evidence. Wilhelm Wien proposed Wien&#x27;s law, which correctly predicted the behaviour at high frequencies, but failed at low frequencies. The Rayleigh–Jeans law, another approach to the problem, agreed with experimental results at low frequencies, but created what was later known as the &quot;ultraviolet catastrophe&quot; at high frequencies, as predicted by classical physics. However, contrary to many textbooks, this was not a motivation for Planck.

Planck&#x27;s first proposed solution to the problem in 1899 followed from what he called the &quot;principle of elementary disorder&quot;, which allowed him to derive Wien&#x27;s law from a number of assumptions about the entropy of an ideal oscillator, creating what was referred to as the Wien–Planck law. Soon, however, it was found that experimental evidence did not confirm the new law at all, to Planck&#x27;s frustration. He revised his approach and now derived the first version of the famous Planck black-body radiation law, which described clearly the experimentally observed black-body spectrum. It was first proposed in a meeting of the DPG on 19 October 1900 and published in 1901. (This first derivation did not include energy quantisation, and did not use statistical mechanics, to which he held an aversion.) In November 1900 Planck revised this first version, now relying on Boltzmann&#x27;s statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics as a way of gaining a more fundamental understanding of the principles behind his radiation law. Planck was deeply suspicious of the philosophical and physical implications of such an interpretation of Boltzmann&#x27;s approach; thus his recourse to them was, as he later put it, &quot;an act of despair ... I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics&quot;.

The central assumption behind his new derivation, presented to the DPG on 14 December 1900, was the supposition, now known as the Planck postulate, that electromagnetic energy could be emitted only in quantized form, in other words, the energy could only be a multiple of an elementary unit:
: formula_1
where is the Planck constant, also known as Planck&#x27;s action quantum (introduced already in 1899), and is the frequency of the radiation. Note that the elementary units of energy discussed here are represented by and not simply by . Physicists now call these quanta photons, and a photon of frequency will have its own specific and unique energy. The total energy at that frequency is then equal to multiplied by the number of photons at that frequency.
At first Planck considered that quantisation was only &quot;a purely formal assumption ... actually I did not think much about it ...&quot;; nowadays this assumption, incompatible with classical physics, is regarded as the birth of quantum physics and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of Planck&#x27;s career. (Boltzmann had been discussing in a theoretical paper in 1877 the possibility that the energy states of a physical system could be discrete). The discovery of the Planck constant enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units (such as the Planck length and the Planck mass), all based on fundamental physical constants, upon which much of quantum theory is based. In a discussion with his son in December 1918 Planck described his discovery as &#x27;a discovery of the first rank, comparable perhaps only to the discoveries of Newton&#x27;. In recognition of Planck&#x27;s fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1918; (he received the award in 1919). 

Subsequently, Planck tried to grasp the meaning of energy quanta, but to no avail. &quot;My unavailing attempts to somehow reintegrate the action quantum into classical theory extended over several years and caused me much trouble.&quot; Even several years later, other physicists such as Rayleigh, Jeans, and Lorentz set the Planck constant to zero in order to align with classical physics, but Planck knew well that this constant had a precise nonzero value. &quot;I am unable to understand Jeans&#x27; stubbornness – he is an example of a theoretician as should never be existing, the same as Hegel was for philosophy. So much the worse for the facts if they don&#x27;t fit.&quot;

Max Born wrote about Planck: &quot;He was, by nature, a conservative mind; he had nothing of the revolutionary and was thoroughly skeptical about speculations. Yet his belief in the compelling force of logical reasoning from facts was so strong that he did not flinch from announcing the most revolutionary idea which ever has shaken physics.&quot;

=== Einstein and the theory of relativity ===

In 1905, the three epochal papers by Albert Einstein were published in the journal &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot;. Planck was among the few who immediately recognized the significance of the special theory of relativity. Thanks to his influence, this theory was soon widely accepted in Germany. Planck also contributed considerably to extend the special theory of relativity. For example, he recast the theory in terms of classical action.

Einstein&#x27;s hypothesis of light &quot;quanta&quot; (photons), based on Heinrich Hertz&#x27;s 1887 discovery (and further investigation by Philipp Lenard) of the photoelectric effect, was initially rejected by Planck. He was unwilling to discard completely Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electrodynamics. &quot;The theory of light would be thrown back not by decades, but by centuries, into the age when Christiaan Huygens dared to fight against the mighty emission theory of Isaac Newton ...&quot;

In 1910, Einstein pointed out the anomalous behavior of specific heat at low temperatures as another example of a phenomenon which defies explanation by classical physics. Planck and Walther Nernst, seeking to clarify the increasing number of contradictions, organized the First Solvay Conference (Brussels 1911). At this meeting Einstein was able to convince Planck.

Meanwhile, Planck had been appointed dean of Berlin University, whereby it was possible for him to call Einstein to Berlin and establish a new professorship for him (1914). Soon the two scientists became close friends and met frequently to play music together.

=== First World War ===
At the onset of the First World War Planck endorsed the general excitement of the public, writing that, &quot;Besides much that is horrible, there is also much that is unexpectedly great and beautiful: the smooth solution of the most difficult domestic political problems by the unification of all parties (and) ... the extolling of everything good and noble.&quot; Planck also signed the infamous &quot;Manifesto of the 93 intellectuals&quot;, a pamphlet of polemic war propaganda (while Einstein retained a strictly pacifistic attitude which almost led to his imprisonment, only being spared thanks to his Swiss citizenship).

In 1915, when Italy was still a neutral power, Planck voted successfully for a scientific paper from Italy, which received a prize from the Prussian Academy of Sciences, where Planck was one of four permanent presidents.

=== Post-war and the Weimar Republic ===
In the turbulent post-war years, Planck, now the highest authority of German physics, issued the slogan &quot;persevere and continue working&quot; to his colleagues.

In October 1920, he and Fritz Haber established the &quot;Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft&quot; (Emergency Organization of German Science), aimed at providing financial support for scientific research. A considerable portion of the money the organization would distribute was raised abroad.

Planck held leading positions at Berlin University, the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the German Physical Society, and the Kaiser Wilhelm Society (which became the Max Planck Society in 1948). During this time economic conditions in Germany were such that he was hardly able to conduct research. In 1926, Planck became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

During the interwar period, Planck became a member of the Deutsche Volks-Partei (German People&#x27;s Party), the party of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Gustav Stresemann, which aspired to liberal aims for domestic policy and rather revisionistic aims for politics around the world.

Planck disagreed with the introduction of universal suffrage and later expressed the view that the Nazi dictatorship resulted from &quot;the ascent of the rule of the crowds&quot;.

=== Quantum mechanics ===

At the end of the 1920s, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Wolfgang Pauli had worked out the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, but it was rejected by Planck, and by Schrödinger, Laue, and Einstein as well. Planck expected that wave mechanics would soon render quantum theory his own child unnecessary. This was not to be the case, however. Further work only served to underscore the enduring central importance of quantum theory, even against his and Einstein&#x27;s philosophical revulsions. Here Planck experienced the truth of his own earlier observation from his struggle with the older views during his younger years: &quot;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.&quot;

=== Nazi dictatorship and the Second World War ===
When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Planck was 74 years old. He witnessed many Jewish friends and colleagues expelled from their positions and humiliated, and hundreds of scientists emigrate from Nazi Germany. Again he tried to &quot;persevere and continue working&quot; and asked scientists who were considering emigration to remain in Germany. Nevertheless, he did help his nephew, the economist Hermann Kranold, to emigrate to London after his arrest. He hoped the crisis would abate soon and the political situation would improve.

Otto Hahn asked Planck to gather well-known German professors in order to issue a public proclamation against the treatment of Jewish professors, but Planck replied, &quot;If you are able to gather today 30 such gentlemen, then tomorrow 150 others will come and speak against it, because they are eager to take over the positions of the others.&quot; Under Planck&#x27;s leadership, the Kaiser Wilhelm Society (KWG) avoided open conflict with the Nazi regime, except concerning the Jewish Fritz Haber. In May of 1933 Planck requested and received an interview with the recently appointed Chancellor of Germany Adolf Hitler to discuss the issue, telling him that the &quot;forced emigration of Jews would kill German science and Jews could be good Germans&quot;, to which the chancellor replied &quot;but we don&#x27;t have anything against the Jews, only against communists&quot;. Planck was therefore unsuccessful, since this reply &quot;took from him every basis for further negotiation&quot;, as to Hitler &quot;the Jews are all Communists, and these are my enemies.&quot; In the following year, 1934, Haber died in exile.

One year later, Planck, having been the president of the KWG since 1930, organized in a somewhat provocative style an official commemorative meeting for Haber. He also succeeded in secretly enabling a number of Jewish scientists to continue working in institutes of the KWG for several years. In 1936, his term as president of the KWG ended, and the Nazi government pressured him to refrain from seeking another term.

As the political climate in Germany gradually became more hostile, Johannes Stark, prominent exponent of the &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; (&quot;German Physics&quot;, also called &quot;Aryan Physics&quot;) attacked Planck, Arnold Sommerfeld, and Heisenberg for continuing to teach the theories of Einstein, calling them &quot;white Jews&quot;. The &quot;Hauptamt Wissenschaft&quot; (Nazi government office for science) started an investigation of Planck&#x27;s ancestry, claiming that he was &quot;1/16 Jewish&quot;, but Planck denied it.

In 1938, Planck celebrated his 80th birthday. The DPG held a celebration, during which the Max-Planck medal (founded as the highest medal by the DPG in 1928) was awarded to French physicist Louis de Broglie. At the end of 1938, the Prussian Academy lost its remaining independence and was taken over by Nazis (&quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;). Planck protested by resigning his presidency. He continued to travel frequently, giving numerous public talks, such as his talk on Religion and Science, and five years later he was sufficiently fit to climb 3,000-metre peaks in the Alps.

During the Second World War the increasing number of Allied bombing missions against Berlin forced Planck and his wife to temporarily leave the city and live in the countryside. In 1942, he wrote: &quot;In me an ardent desire has grown to persevere this crisis and live long enough to be able to witness the turning point, the beginning of a new rise.&quot; In February 1944, his home in Berlin was completely destroyed by an air raid, annihilating all his scientific records and correspondence. His rural retreat was threatened by the rapid advance of the Allied armies from both sides.

In 1944, Planck&#x27;s son Erwin was arrested by the Gestapo following the attempted assassination of Hitler in the . He was tried and sentenced to death by the People&#x27;s Court in October 1944. Erwin was hanged at Berlin&#x27;s Plötzensee Prison in January 1945. The death of his son destroyed much of Planck&#x27;s will to live.

== Personal life and death ==
In March 1887, Planck married Marie Merck (1861–1909), sister of a school fellow, and moved with her into a sublet apartment in Kiel. They had four children: Karl (1888–1916), the twins Emma (1889–1919) and Grete (1889–1917), and Erwin (1893–1945).

After living in the apartment in Berlin, the Planck family lived in a villa in Berlin-Grunewald, Wangenheimstrasse 21. Several other professors from University of Berlin lived nearby, among them theologian Adolf von Harnack, who became a close friend of Planck. Soon the Planck home became a social and cultural center. Numerous well-known scientists, such as Albert Einstein, Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner were frequent visitors. The tradition of jointly performing music had already been established in the home of Helmholtz.

After several happy years, in July 1909 Marie Planck died, possibly from tuberculosis. 

In March 1911 Planck married his second wife, Marga von Hoesslin (1882–1948); in December his fifth child Hermann was born.

During the First World War Planck&#x27;s second son Erwin was taken prisoner by the French in 1914, while his oldest son Karl was killed in action at Verdun. Grete died in 1917 while giving birth to her first child. Her sister died the same way two years later, after having married Grete&#x27;s widower. Both granddaughters survived and were named after their mothers. Planck endured these losses stoically.

In January 1945, Erwin Planck, to whom he had been particularly close, was sentenced to death by the Nazi Volksgerichtshof because of his participation in the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in July 1944. Erwin was executed on 23 January 1945.

After World War II ended, Planck, his second wife, and their son were brought to a relative in Göttingen, where Planck died on October 4, 1947. He was buried in the old Stadtfriedhof (City Cemetery) in Göttingen.

== Religious views ==

Planck was a member of the Lutheran Church in Germany. He was very tolerant toward alternative views and religions. In a lecture in 1937 entitled &quot;Religion und Naturwissenschaft&quot; (&quot;Religion and Natural Science&quot;) he suggested the importance of these symbols and rituals related directly with a believer&#x27;s ability to worship God, but that one must be mindful that the symbols provide an imperfect illustration of divinity. He criticized atheism for being focused on the derision of such symbols, while at the same time warned of the over-estimation of the importance of such symbols by believers.

In &quot;Religion und Naturwissenschaft&quot;, Planck expressed the view that God is present everywhere, and he held that &quot;the holiness of the unintelligible Godhead is conveyed by the holiness of symbols.&quot; Atheists, he thought, attach too much importance to what are merely symbols. He was a churchwarden from 1920 until his death, and believed in an almighty, all-knowing, beneficent God (although not necessarily a personal one). Both science and religion wage a &quot;tireless battle against skepticism and dogmatism, against unbelief and superstition&quot; with the goal &quot;toward God!&quot;

Planck said in 1944, &quot;As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much: There is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent spirit [orig. &quot;geist&quot;]. This spirit is the matrix of all matter.&quot;

Planck argued that the concept of God is important to both religion and science, but in different ways: &quot;Both religion and science require a belief in God. For believers, God is in the beginning, and for physicists He is at the end of all considerations … To the former He is the foundation, to the latter, the crown of the edifice of every generalized world view&quot;.

Furthermore, Planck wrote, ...&quot;to believe&quot; means &quot;to recognize as a truth&quot;, and the knowledge of nature, continually advancing on incontestably safe tracks, has made it utterly impossible for a person possessing some training in natural science to recognize as founded on truth the many reports of extraordinary occurrences contradicting the laws of nature, of miracles which are still commonly regarded as essential supports and confirmations of religious doctrines, and which formerly used to be accepted as facts pure and simple, without doubt or criticism. The belief in miracles must retreat step by step before relentlessly and reliably progressing science and we cannot doubt that sooner or later it must vanish completely.

Noted historian of science John L. Heilbron characterized Planck&#x27;s views on God as deistic. Heilbron further relates that when asked about his religious affiliation, Planck replied that although he had always been deeply religious, he did not believe &quot;in a personal God, let alone a Christian God&quot;.
