<text>Panspermia () is the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe, distributed by space dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, and planetoids, as well as by spacecraft carrying unintended contamination by microorganisms, known as directed panspermia. The theory argues that life did not originate on Earth, but instead evolved somewhere else and seeded life as we know it.

Panspermia comes in many forms, such as radiopanspermia, lithopanspermia, and directed panspermia. Regardless of its form, the theories generally propose that microbes able to survive in outer space (such as certain types of bacteria or plant spores) can become trapped in debris ejected into space after collisions between planets and small solar system bodies that harbor life. This debris containing the lifeforms is then transported by meteors between bodies in a solar system, or even across solar systems within a galaxy. In this way, panspermia studies concentrate not on how life began but on methods that may distribute it within the Universe. This point is often used as a criticism of the theory.

Panspermia is a fringe theory with little support amongst mainstream scientists. Critics argue that it does not answer the question of the origin of life but merely places it on another celestial body. It is further criticized because it cannot be tested experimentally. Historically, disputes over the merit of this theory centered on whether life is ubiquitous or emergent throughout the Universe. The theory maintains support today, with some work being done to develop mathematical treatments of how life might migrate naturally throughout the Universe. Its long history lends itself to extensive speculation and hoaxes that have arisen from meteoritic events.

In contrast, pseudo-panspermia is the well-supported hypothesis that many of the small organic molecules used for life originated in space, and were distributed to planetary surfaces.

== History ==

Panspermia has a long history, dating back to the 5th century BCE and the natural philosopher Anaxagoras. Classicists came to agree that Anaxagoras maintained the Universe (or Cosmos) was full of life, and that life on Earth started from the fall of these extra-terrestrial seeds. Panspermia as it is known today, however, is not identical to this original theory. The name, as applied to this theory, was only first coined in 1908 by Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish scientist. Prior to this, since around the 1860s, many prominent scientists were becoming interested in the theory, for example Sir Fred Hoyle, and Chandra Wickramasinghe.

In the 1860s, there were three scientific developments that began to bring the focus of the scientific community to the problem of the origin of life. Firstly, the Kant-Laplace Nebular theory of solar system and planetary formation was gaining favor, and implied that when the Earth first formed, the surface conditions would have been inhospitable to life as we know it. This meant that life could not have evolved parallel with the Earth, and must have evolved at a later date, without biological precursors. Secondly, Charles Darwin&#x27;s famous theory of evolution implied some elusive origin, because in order for something to evolve, it must start somewhere. In his &quot;Origin of Species&quot;, Darwin was unable or unwilling to touch on this issue. Third and finally, Louis Pasteur and John Tyndall experimentally disproved the (now superseded) theory of spontaneous generation, which suggested that life was &quot;constantly&quot; evolving from non-living matter and did not have a common ancestor, as suggested by Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution.

Altogether, these three developments in science presented the wider scientific community with a seemingly paradoxical situation regarding the origin of life: life must have evolved from non-biological precursors after the Earth was formed, and yet spontaneous generation as a theory had been experimentally disproved. From here, is where the study of the origin of life branched. Those who accepted Pasteur&#x27;s rejection of spontaneous generation began to develop the theory that under (unknown) conditions on a primitive Earth, life must have gradually evolved from organic material. This theory became known as abiogenesis, and is the currently accepted one. On the other side of this are those scientists of the time who rejected Pasteur&#x27;s results and instead supported the idea that life on Earth came from existing life. This necessarily requires that life has always existed somewhere on some planet, and that it has a mechanism of transferring between planets. Thus, the modern treatment of panspermia began in earnest.

Lord Kelvin, in a presentation to The British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1871, proposed the idea that similarly to how seeds can be transferred through the air by winds, so can life be brought to Earth by the infall of a life-bearing meteorite. He further proposed the idea that life can only come from life, and that this principle is invariant under philosophical uniformitarianism, similar to how matter can neither be created nor destroyed. This argument was heavily criticized because of its boldness, and additionally due to technical objections from the wider community. In particular, Johann Zollner from Germany argued against Kelvin by saying that organisms carried in meteorites to Earth would not survive the descent through the atmosphere due to friction heating.

The arguments went back and forth until Svante Arrhenius gave the theory its modern treatment and designation. Arrhenius argued against abiogenesis on the basis that it had no experimental foundation at the time, and believed that life had always existed somewhere in the Universe. He focused his efforts of developing the mechanism(s) by which this pervasive life may be transferred through the Universe. At this time, it was recently discovered that solar radiation can exert pressure, and thus force, on matter. Arrhenius thus concluded that it is possible that very small organisms such as bacterial spores could be moved around due to this radiation pressure.

At this point, panspermia as a theory now had a potentially viable transport mechanism, as well as a vehicle for carrying life from planet to planet. The theory still faced criticism mostly due to doubts about how long spores would actually survive under the conditions of their transport from one planet, through space, to another. Despite all the emphasis placed on trying to establish the scientific legitimacy of this theory, it still lacked testability; that was and still is a serious problem the theory has yet to overcome.

Support for the theory persisted, however, with Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe using two reasons for why an extra-terrestrial origin of life might be preferred. First is that required conditions for the origin of life may have been more favorable somewhere other than Earth, and second that life on Earth exhibits properties that are not accounted for by assuming an endogenic origin. Hoyle studied spectra of interstellar dust, and came to the conclusion that space contained large amounts of organics, which he suggested were the building blocks of the more complex chemical structures. Critically, Hoyle argued that this chemical evolution was unlikely to have taken place on a prebiotic Earth, and instead the most likely candidate is a comet. Furthermore, Hoyle and Wickramasinghe concluded that the evolution of life requires a large increase in genetic information and diversity, which might have resulted from the influx of viral material from space via comets. Hoyle reported (in a lecture at Oxford on January 16, 1978) a pattern of coincidence between the arrival of major epidemics and the occasions of close encounters with comets, which lead Hoyle to suggest that the epidemics were a direct result of material raining down from these comets. This claim in particular garnered criticism from biologists.

Since the 1970s, a new era of planetary exploration meant that data could be used to test panspermia and potentially transform it from conjecture to a testable theory. Though it has yet to be tested, panspermia is still explored today in some mathematical treatments, and as its long history suggests, the appeal of the theory has stood the test of time.

== Overview ==

=== Core requirements ===

Panspermia requires:

# that life has always existed in the Universe somewhere
# that organic molecules originated in space (perhaps to be distributed to Earth)
# that life originated from these molecules, extraterrestrially
# that this extraterrestrial life was transported to Earth.

The creation and distribution of organic molecules from space is now uncontroversial; it is known as pseudo-panspermia. The jump from organic materials to life originating from space, however, is hypothetical and currently untestable.

=== Transport vessels ===
Bacterial spores and plant seeds are two common proposed vessels for panspermia. According to the theory, they could be encased in a meteorite and transported to another planet from their origin, subsequently descend through the atmosphere and populate the surface with life (see lithopanspermia below). This naturally requires that these spores and seeds have formed somewhere else, maybe even in space in the case of how panspermia deals with bacteria. Understanding of planetary formation theory and meteorites has led to the idea that some rocky bodies originating from undifferentiated parent bodies could be able to generate local conditions conducive to life. Hypothetically, internal heating from radiogenic isotopes could melt ice to provide water as well as energy. In fact, some meteorites have been found to show signs of aqueous alteration which may indicate that this process has taken place. Given that there are such large numbers of these bodies found within the Solar System, an argument can be made that they each provide a potential site for life to develop. A collision occurring in the asteroid belt could alter the orbit of one such site, and eventually deliver it to Earth.

Plant seeds can be an alternative transport vessel. Some plants produce seeds that are resistant to the conditions of space, which have been shown to lie dormant in extreme cold, vacuum, and resist short wavelength UV radiation. They are not typically proposed to have originated on space, but on another planet. Theoretically, even if a plant is partially damaged during its travel in space, the pieces could still seed life in a sterile environment. Sterility of the environment is relevant because it is unclear if the novel plant could out-compete existing life forms. This idea is based on previous evidence showing that cellular reconstruction can occur from cytoplasms released from damaged algae. Furthermore, plant cells contain obligate endosymbionts, which could be released into a new environment.

Though both plant seeds and bacterial spores have been proposed as potentially viable vehicles, their ability to not only survive in space for the required time, but also survive atmospheric entry is debated.

Space probes may be a viable transport mechanism for interplanetary cross-pollination within the Solar System. Space agencies have implemented planetary protection procedures to reduce the risk of planetary contamination, but microorganisms such as &quot;Tersicoccus phoenicis&quot; may be resistant to spacecraft assembly cleaning.

== Variations of panspermia theory ==

Panspermia is generally subdivided into two classes: either transfer occurs between planets of the same system (interplanetary) or between stellar systems (interstellar). Further classifications are based on different proposed transport mechanisms, as follows.

===Radiopanspermia===
In 1903, Svante Arrhenius proposed radiopanspermia, the theory that singular microscopic forms of life can be propagated in space, driven by the radiation pressure from stars. This is the mechanism by which light can exert a force on matter. Arrhenius argued that particles at a critical size below 1.5 μm would be propelled at high speed by radiation pressure of a star. However, because its effectiveness decreases with increasing size of the particle, this mechanism holds for very tiny particles only, such as single bacterial spores.

==== Counterarguments ====
The main criticism of radiopanspermia came from Iosif Shklovsky and Carl Sagan, who cited evidence for the lethal action of space radiation (UV and X-rays) in the cosmos. If enough of these microorganisms are ejected into space, some may rain down on a planet in a new star system after 106 years wandering interstellar space. There would be enormous death rates of the organisms due to radiation and the generally hostile conditions of space, but nonetheless this theory is considered potentially viable by some.

Data gathered by the orbital experiments ERA, BIOPAN, EXOSTACK and EXPOSE showed that isolated spores, including those of &quot;B. subtilis&quot;, were rapidly killed if exposed to the full space environment for merely a few seconds, but if shielded against solar UV, the spores were capable of surviving in space for up to six years while embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). Spores would therefore need to be heavily protected against UV radiation: exposure of unprotected DNA to solar UV and cosmic ionizing radiation would break it up into its constituent bases. Rocks at least 1 meter in diameter are required to effectively shield resistant microorganisms, such as bacterial spores against galactic cosmic radiation. Additionally, exposing DNA to the ultrahigh vacuum of space alone is sufficient to cause DNA damage, so the transport of unprotected DNA or RNA during interplanetary flights powered solely by light pressure is extremely unlikely.

The feasibility of other means of transport for the more massive shielded spores into the outer Solar System—for example, through gravitational capture by comets—is unknown. There is little evidence in full support of the radiopanspermia hypothesis.

=== Lithopanspermia ===
This transport mechanism generally arose following the discovery of exoplanets, and the sudden availability of data following the growth of planetary science. Lithopanspermia is the proposed transfer of organisms in rocks from one planet to another through planetary objects such as in comets or asteroids, and remains speculative. A variant would be for organisms to travel between star systems on nomadic exoplanets or exomoons.

Although there is no concrete evidence that lithopanspermia has occurred in the Solar System, the various stages have become amenable to experimental testing.

* Planetary ejection – For lithopanspermia to occur, microorganisms must first survive ejection from a planetary surface (assuming they do not form on meteorites, as suggested in), which involves extreme forces of acceleration and shock with associated temperature rises. Hypothetical values of shock pressures experienced by ejected rocks are obtained from Martian meteorites, which suggest pressures of approximately 5 to 55 GPa, acceleration of 3 Mm/s2, jerk of 6 Gm/s3 and post-shock temperature increases of about 1 K to 1000 K. Though these conditions are extreme, some organisms appear able to survive them.
* Survival in transit – Now in space, the microorganisms have to make it to their next destination for lithopanspermia to be successful. The survival of microorganisms has been studied extensively using both simulated facilities and in low Earth orbit. A large number of microorganisms have been selected for exposure experiments, both human-borne microbes (significant for future crewed missions) and extremophiles (significant for determining the physiological requirements of survival in space). Bacteria in particular can exhibit a survival mechanism whereby a colony generates a biofilm that enhances its protection against UV radiation.
* Atmospheric entry – The final stage of lithopanspermia, is re-entry onto a viable planet via its atmosphere. This requires that the organisms are able to further survive potential atmospheric ablation. Tests of this stage could use sounding rockets and orbital vehicles. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; spores inoculated onto granite domes were twice subjected to hypervelocity atmospheric transit by launch to a ~120 km altitude on an Orion two-stage rocket. The spores survived on the sides of the rock, but not on the forward-facing surface that reached 145 °C. As photosynthetic organisms must be close to the surface of a rock to obtain sufficient light energy, atmospheric transit might act as a filter against them by ablating the surface layers of the rock. Although cyanobacteria can survive the desiccating, freezing conditions of space, the STONE experiment showed that they cannot survive atmospheric entry. Small non-photosynthetic organisms deep within rocks might survive the exit and entry process, including impact survival.

Lithopanspermia, described by the mechanism above can exist as either interplanetary or interstellar. It is possible to quantify panspermia models and treat them as viable mathematical theories. For example, a recent study of planets of the Trappist-1 planetary system, presents a model for estimating the probability of interplanetary panspermia, similar to studies in the past done about Earth-Mars panspermia. This study found that lithopanspermia is &#x27;orders of magnitude more likely to occur&#x27; in the Trappist-1 system as opposed to the Earth-to-Mars scenario. According to their analysis, the increase in probability of lithopanspermia is linked to an increased probability of abiogenesis amongst the Trappist-1 planets. In a way, these modern treatments attempt to keep panspermia as a contributing factor to abiogenesis, as opposed to a theory that directly opposes it. In line with this, it is suggested that if biosignatures could be detected on two (or more) adjacent planets, that would provide evidence that panspermia is a potentially required mechanism for abiogenesis. As of yet, no such discovery has been made.

Lithopanspermia has also been hypothesized to operate between stellar systems. One mathematical analysis, estimating the total number of rocky or icy objects that could potentially be captured by planetary systems within the Milky Way, has concluded that lithopanspermia is not necessarily bound to a single stellar system. This not only requires these objects have life in the first place, but also that it survives the journey. Thus intragalactic lithopanspermia is heavily dependent on the survival lifetime of organisms, as well as the velocity of the transporter. Again, there is no evidence that such a process has, or can occur.

==== Counterarguments====
The complex nature of the requirements for lithopanspermia, as well as evidence against the longevity of bacteria being able to survive under these conditions, makes lithopanspermia a difficult theory to get behind. That being said, impact events did happen a lot in the early stages of the solar system formation, and still happen to a certain degree today within the asteroid belt.

=== Directed panspermia ===
First proposed in 1972 by Nobel prize winner Francis Crick, along with Leslie Orgel, directed panspermia is the theory that life was deliberately brought to Earth by a higher intelligent being from another planet. In light of the evidence at the time that it seems unlikely for an organism to have been delivered to Earth via radiopanspermia or lithopanspermia, Crick and Orgel proposed this as an alternative theory, though it is worth noting that Orgel was less serious about the claim. They do acknowledge that the scientific evidence is lacking, but discuss what kinds of evidence would be needed to support the theory. In a similar vein, Thomas Gold suggested that life on Earth might have originated accidentally from a pile of &#x27;Cosmic Garbage&#x27; dumped on Earth long ago by extraterrestrial beings. These theories are often considered more science fiction, however, Crick and Orgel use the principle of cosmic reversibility to argue for it.

This principle is based on the fact that if our species is capable of infecting a sterile planet, then what is preventing another technological society from having done that to Earth in the past? They concluded that it would be possible to deliberately infect another planet in the foreseeable future. As far as evidence goes, Crick and Orgel argued that given the universality of the genetic code, it follows that an infective theory for life is viable.

Directed panspermia could, in theory, be demonstrated by finding a distinctive &#x27;signature&#x27; message had been deliberately implanted into either the genome or the genetic code of the first microorganisms by our hypothetical progenitor, some 4 billion years ago. However, there is no known mechanism that could prevent mutation and natural selection from removing such a message over long periods of time.

==== Counterarguments ====
In 1972, both abiogenesis and panspermia were seen as viable theories by different experts. Given this, Crick and Orgel argued that experimental evidence required to validate one theory over the other was lacking. That being said, evidence strongly in favor of abiogenesis over panspermia exists today, whereas evidence for panspermia, particularly directed panspermia, is decidedly lacking.

=== Origination and distribution of organic molecules: Pseudo-panspermia ===
Pseudo-panspermia is the well-supported hypothesis that many of the small organic molecules used for life originated in space, and were distributed to planetary surfaces. Life then emerged on Earth, and perhaps on other planets, by the processes of abiogenesis. Evidence for pseudo-panspermia includes the discovery of organic compounds such as sugars, amino acids, and nucleobases in meteorites and other extraterrestrial bodies, and the formation of similar compounds in the laboratory under outer space conditions. A prebiotic polyester system has been explored as an example.
== Hoaxes &amp; speculations ==

=== Orgueil meteorite ===
On May 14, 1864, twenty fragments from a meteorite crashed into the French city of Orgueil. A separate fragment of the Orgueil meteorite (kept in a sealed glass jar since its discovery) was found in 1965 to have a seed capsule embedded in it, while the original glassy layer on the outside remained undisturbed. Despite great initial excitement, the seed was found to be that of a European Juncaceae or rush plant that had been glued into the fragment and camouflaged using coal dust. The outer &quot;fusion layer&quot; was in fact glue. While the perpetrator of this hoax is unknown, it is thought that they sought to influence the 19th-century debate on spontaneous generation—rather than panspermia—by demonstrating the transformation of inorganic to biological matter.

=== Oumuamua ===
In 2017, the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii detected a reddish object up to 400 meters in length. Analysis of its orbit provided evidence that it was an interstellar object, originating from outside our Solar System. From this Avi Loeb speculated that the object was instead an artifact from an alien civilization and could potentially be evidence for directed panspermia. This claim has been considered unlikely by other authors.

<text>&quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom: An Invitation to Enter a New Field of Physics&quot; was a lecture given by physicist Richard Feynman at the annual American Physical Society meeting at Caltech on December 29, 1959. Feynman considered the possibility of direct manipulation of individual atoms as a more robust form of synthetic chemistry than those used at the time. Versions of the talk were reprinted in a few popular magazines, but it went largely unnoticed until the 1980s.

The title references the popular quote &quot;There is always room at the top.&quot; attributed to Daniel Webster (who is thought to have said this phrase in response to warnings against becoming a lawyer, which was seen as an oversaturated field in the 19th century).

==Conception==
Feynman considered some ramifications of a general ability to manipulate matter on an atomic scale. He was particularly interested in the possibilities of denser computer circuitry and microscopes that could see things much smaller than is possible with scanning electron microscopes. These ideas were later realized by the use of the scanning tunneling microscope, the atomic force microscope and other examples of scanning probe microscopy and storage systems such as Millipede.

Feynman also suggested that it should be possible, in principle, to make nanoscale machines that &quot;arrange the atoms the way we want&quot; and do chemical synthesis by mechanical manipulation.

He also presented the possibility of &quot;swallowing the doctor&quot;, an idea that he credited in the essay to his friend and graduate student Albert Hibbs. This concept involved building a tiny, swallowable surgical robot.

As a thought experiment, he proposed developing a set of one-quarter-scale manipulator hands controlled by the hands of a human operator, to build one-quarter scale machine tools analogous to those found in any machine shop. This set of small tools would then be used by the small hands to build and operate ten sets of one-sixteenth-scale hands and tools, and so forth, culminating in perhaps a billion tiny factories to achieve massively parallel operations. He uses the analogy of a pantograph as a way of scaling down items. This idea was anticipated in part, down to the microscale, by science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein in his 1942 story &quot;Waldo&quot;.

As the sizes got smaller, one would have to redesign tools because the relative strength of various forces would change. Gravity would become less important, and Van der Waals forces such as surface tension would become more important. Feynman mentioned these scaling issues during his talk. Nobody has yet attempted to implement this thought experiment; some types of biological enzymes and enzyme complexes (especially ribosomes) function chemically in a way close to Feynman&#x27;s vision. Feynman also mentioned in his lecture that it might be better eventually to use glass or plastic because their greater uniformity would avoid problems in the very small scale (metals and crystals are separated into domains where the lattice structure prevails). This could be a good reason to make machines and electronics out of glass and plastic. At present, there are electronic components made of both materials. In glass, there are optical fiber cables that carry and amplify light. In plastic, field effect transistors are being made with polymers, such as polythiophene that becomes an electrical conductor when oxidized.

==Challenges==
At the meeting Feynman concluded his talk with two challenges, and offered a prize of $1000 for the first to solve each one. The first challenge involved the construction of a tiny motor, which, to Feynman&#x27;s surprise, was achieved by November 1960 by Caltech graduate William McLellan, a meticulous craftsman, using conventional tools. The motor met the conditions, but did not advance the field. The second challenge involved the possibility of scaling down letters small enough so as to be able to fit the entire &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; on the head of a pin, by writing the information from a book page on a surface 1/25,000 smaller in linear scale. In 1985, Tom Newman, a Stanford graduate student, successfully reduced the first paragraph of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; by 1/25,000, and collected the second Feynman prize. Newman&#x27;s thesis adviser, R. Fabian Pease, had read the paper in 1966, but it was another graduate student in the lab, Ken Polasko, who had recently read it who suggested attempting the challenge. Newman was looking for an arbitrary random pattern to demonstrate their technology. Newman said, &quot;Text was ideal because it has so many different shapes.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The New Scientist&quot; reported &quot;the scientific audience was captivated.&quot; Feynman had &quot;spun the idea off the top of his mind&quot; without even &quot;notes from beforehand&quot;. There were no copies of the speech available. A &quot;foresighted admirer&quot; brought a tape recorder and an edited transcript, without Feynman&#x27;s jokes, was made for publication by Caltech. In February 1960, Caltech&#x27;s &quot;Engineering and Science&quot; published the speech. In addition to excerpts in &quot;The New Scientist&quot;, versions were printed in &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; and &quot;Popular Science&quot;. Newspapers announced the winning of the first challenge. The lecture was included as the final chapter in the 1961 book, &quot;Miniaturization&quot;.

==Impact==

K. Eric Drexler later took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves, via computer control instead of control by a human operator, in his 1986 book &quot;Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology&quot;.

After Feynman&#x27;s death, scholars studying the historical development of nanotechnology have concluded that his role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was not highly rated by many people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. Chris Toumey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of South Carolina, has reconstructed the history of the publication and republication of Feynman&#x27;s talk, along with the record of citations to &quot;Plenty of Room&quot; in the scientific literature.

In Toumey&#x27;s 2008 article &quot;Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology&quot;, he found 11 versions of the publication of &quot;Plenty of Room&quot;, plus two instances of a closely related talk by Feynman, &quot;Infinitesimal Machinery&quot;, which Feynman called &quot;Plenty of Room, Revisited&quot; (published under the name &quot;Infinitesimal Machinery&quot;). Also in Toumey&#x27;s references are videotapes of that second talk. The journal &quot;Nature Nanotechnology&quot; dedicated an issue in 2009 to the subject.

Toumey found that the published versions of Feynman&#x27;s talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the scanning tunneling microscope was invented in 1981. Interest in &quot;Plenty of Room&quot; in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s. This is probably because the term &quot;nanotechnology&quot; gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by Drexler in his 1986 book, &quot;Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology&quot;, which cited Feynman, and in a cover article headlined &quot;Nanotechnology&quot;, published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, &quot;OMNI&quot;. The journal &quot;Nanotechnology&quot; was launched in 1989; the famous Eigler-Schweizer experiment, precisely manipulating 35 xenon atoms, was published in &quot;Nature&quot; in April 1990; and &quot;Science&quot; had a special issue on nanotechnology in November 1991. These and other developments hint that the retroactive rediscovery of &quot;Plenty of Room&quot; gave nanotechnology a packaged history that provided an early date of December 1959, plus a connection to Richard Feynman.

Toumey&#x27;s analysis also includes comments from scientists in nanotechnology who say that &quot;Plenty of Room&quot; did not influence their early work, and most of them had not read it until a later date.

Feynman&#x27;s stature as a Nobel laureate and an important figure in 20th-century science helped advocates of nanotechnology. It provided a valuable intellectual link to the past. More concretely, his stature and concept of atomically precise fabrication played a role in securing funding for nanotechnology research, illustrated by President Clinton&#x27;s January 2000 speech calling for a federal program:

The version of the Nanotechnology Research and Development Act that the House passed in May 2003 called for a study of the technical feasibility of molecular manufacturing, but this study was removed to safeguard funding of less controversial research before it was passed by the Senate and signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 3, 2003.

In 2016, a group of researchers of TU Delft and INL reported the storage of a paragraph of Feynman&#x27;s talk using binary code where every bit was made with a single atomic vacancy. Using a scanning tunnelling microscope to manipulate thousand of atoms, the researchers crafted the text:

This text uses exactly 1 kibibyte, i.e., 8192 bits, made with 1 atom vacancy each, constituting thereby the first atomic kibibyte, with a storage density 500 times larger than the state of the art approaches. The text required to &quot;arrange the atoms the way we want&quot;, in a checkerboard pattern. This self-referential tribute to Feynman&#x27;s vision was covered both by scientific journals and mainstream media.

<doc id="23681" wikidata="Q131026" url="?curid=23681" title="Philately">
<text>Philately (; ) is the study of postage stamps and postal history. It also refers to the collection and appreciation of stamps and other philatelic products. While closely associated with stamp collecting and the study of postage, it is possible to be a philatelist without owning any stamps. For instance, the stamps being studied may be very rare or reside only in museums.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;philately&quot; is the English transliteration of the French &quot;&quot;, coined by Georges Herpin in 1864. Herpin stated that stamps had been collected and studied for the previous six or seven years and a better name was required for the new hobby than &quot;timbromanie&quot; (roughly &quot;stamp mania&quot;), which was disliked. The alternative terms &quot;timbromania&quot;, &quot;timbrophily&quot;, and &quot;timbrology&quot; gradually fell out of use as &quot;philately&quot; gained acceptance during the 1860s. Herpin took the Greek root word &quot;phil(o)-&quot;, meaning &quot;an attraction or affinity for something&quot;, and &quot;ateleia&quot;, meaning &quot;exempt from duties and taxes&quot;, to form the neologism &quot;philatélie&quot;.

==History==
===Nineteenth century===
As a collection field, philately appeared after the introduction of the postage stamps in 1840, but did not gain large attraction until the mid-1850s. In the U.S., early collectors of stamps were known as &quot;stamp gatherers&quot;. The United States Post Office Department re-issued stamps in 1875 due to public demand for &#x27;old stamps&#x27;, including those from before the American Civil War. Some authors believe that the first philatelist appeared on the day of the release of the world&#x27;s first postage stamp, dated to 6 May 1840, when the Liverson, Denby and Lavie London law office sent a letter to Scotland franked with ten uncut Penny Blacks, stamped with the postmark &quot;LS.6MY6. 1840.&quot; In 1992 at an auction in Zürich, this envelope was sold for 690,000 francs.

Already in 1846, cases of collecting stamps in large numbers were known in England. However, without reason for collection, stamps at this time were used for pasting wallpaper. The first philatelist is considered to be a postmaster going by the name Mansen, who lived in Paris, and in 1855 had sold his collection, which contained almost all the postage stamps issued by that time. The stamp merchant and second-hand book dealer Edard de Laplante bought it, recognizing the definitive collector&#x27;s worth of the postage stamp. Due to the boom in popularity and news of this transaction, stamp merchants like Laplante began to emerge.

Towards the end of the 19th century, stamp collecting reached hundreds of thousands of people of all classes. Some countries had collections of postage stamps – for example, England, Germany, France, Bavaria, and Bulgaria. In countries which held national collections, museums dedicated to the nation&#x27;s history with philately were founded, and the first such appeared in Germany, France, and Bulgaria. Allegedly, the first of these museums housed the collection of the British Museum, curated by MP Thomas Tapling and bequeathed to the Museum in 1891. The Museum für Kommunikation Berlin also had an extensive collection of stamps. The largest private collection of the time belonged to Philipp von Ferrary in Paris.

As the number of postage stamp issues increased every year, collection became progressively difficult. Therefore, from the early 1880s, &quot;collector experts&quot; appeared, specializing their collection to only one part of the world, a group of nations, or even only one.

===Twentieth century===

Philately as one of the most popular types of collecting continued to develop in the 20th century. Along with the &quot;Scott&quot;, &quot;Stanley Gibbons&quot;, and &quot;Yvert et Tellier&quot; catalogs, the &quot;Zumstein&quot; (first published in Switzerland, 1909), and the &quot;Michel&quot; (first published in Germany, 1910) catalogs began publication.

In 1934, the idea to celebrate an annual Postage Stamp Day was suggested by Hans von Rudolphi, a German philatelist. The idea was adopted rapidly in Germany, and gained later adoption in other countries. Stamp Day is a memorial day established by the postal administration of a country and annually celebrated, which is designed to attract public attention to, popularize the use of, and expand the reach of postal correspondence, and contribute to the development of philately. In 1968, Cuba dedicated a postage stamp for Stamp Day with an image of G. Sciltian&#x27;s &quot;El filatelista&quot;.

In 1926, the Fédération Internationale de Philatélie (FIP) was founded, where international philatelic exhibitions have been regularly organized since 1929. The first World Philatelic Exhibition in Prague was held between August and September 1962; in 1976, the FIP brought together national societies from 57 countries, which held over 100 exhibitions, and in 1987, over 60 countries entered the FIP.

Since the middle of the 20th century, philately has become the most widespread field of amateur collecting, which was facilitated by:

* significantly expanded postal exchanges between countries,
* many countries&#x27; post offices issuing:
** Cinderella stamps,
** commemorative emissions,
** multicolor series of stamps devoted to history, the most important events of our time, art, fauna, flora, sports, etc. .;
** individual stamps, sheets (a sheet with one or more printed stamps and inscription on the margins) and items intended specifically for philatelists;
* widespread sale of collection signs of postage (including commissioned ones), albums, stockbooks and other items of philately;
* publication of stamp catalogs;
* national and international exhibitions organized by philatelic societies, domestic and international exchanges, philately propaganda through specialized magazines and other periodicals.

Philately magazines, at this time, were published as far east as Poland, and as far west as North America. In Canada, &quot;Canadian Stamp News&quot; was established in 1976 as an off-shoot to &quot;Canadian Coin News&quot;, which was launched about a decade earlier.

Philately was largely advanced by the USSR and nations within its sphere of influence, and the United States, France, the UK, and Austria. The British Library Philatelic Collections and the postal museums in Stockholm, Paris, and Bern had unique national philately collections at that time, and among the famous private collections are those of the Royal Philatelic Collection, F. Ferrari (Austria), M. Burrus (Switzerland), A. Lichtenstein, A. Hind, J. Boker (U.S.), and H. Kanai (Japan).

In the mid-1970s, national philately organizations and associations existed in most countries, and 150–200 million people were involved in philately during meetings established.

===Twenty-first century===
From 28 August to 1 September 2004, the World Stamp Championship was held for the first time in the history of world philately in Singapore.

==Types==
Traditional philately is the study of the technical aspects of stamp production and stamp identification, including:
* The stamp design process
* The paper used (wove, laid and including watermarks)
* The method of printing (engraving, typography)
* The gum
* The method of separation (perforation, rouletting)
* Any overprints on the stamp
* Any security markings, underprints or perforated initials (&quot;perfins&quot;)
* The study of philatelic fakes and forgeries

==Diversification==
Expanding range of activity: 
* Thematic philately, also known as topical philately, is the study of what is depicted on individual stamps. There are hundreds of popular subjects, such as birds, and ships, poets, presidents, monarchs, maps, aircraft, spacecraft, sports, and insects on stamps. Stamps depicted on stamps also constitute a topical area of collecting. Interesting aspects of topical philately include design mistakes and alterations; for instance, the recent editing out of cigarettes from the pictures used for United States stamps, and the stories of how particular images came to be used.
* Postal history studies the postal systems and how they operate and, or, the study of postage stamps and covers and associated material illustrating historical episodes of postal systems both before and after the introduction of the adhesive stamps. It includes the study of postmarks, post offices, postal authorities, postal rates and regulations and the process by which letters are moved from sender to recipient, including routes and choice of conveyance. A classic example is the Pony Express, which was the fastest way to send letters across the United States during the few months that it operated. Covers that can be proven to have been sent by the Pony Express are highly prized by collectors.
* Aerophilately is the branch of postal history that specializes in the study of airmail. Philatelists have observed the development of mail transport by air from its beginning, and all aspects of airmail services have been extensively studied and documented by specialists.
*Astrophilately is the branch of postal history that specializes in the study of stamps and postmarked envelopes that are connected to outer space.
* Postal stationery includes stamped envelopes, postal cards, letter sheets, aérogrammes (airletter sheets) and wrappers, most of which have an embossed or imprinted stamp or indicia indicating the prepayment of postage.
* Erinnophilia is the study of objects (cinderella stamps) that look like stamps, but are not postage stamps. Examples include Easter Seals, Christmas Seals, propaganda labels, and so forth.
* Philatelic literature documents the results of the philatelic study and includes thousands of books and periodicals.
* Revenue philately is the study of stamps used to collect taxes or fees on such things as legal documents, court fees, receipts, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, drugs and medicines, playing cards, hunting licenses and newspapers.
* Maximaphily is the study of Maximum Cards. Maximum Cards can be defined as a picture postcard with a postage stamp on the same theme and cancellation, with a maximum concordance between all three.
* Letterlocking includes &quot;the process of folding and securing of letter substrates to become their own envelopes&quot; or to create a form of &quot;tamper-evident locking mechanism.&quot;

==Tools==
Philately uses several tools, including stamp tongs (a specialized form of tweezers) to safely handle the stamps, a strong magnifying glass and a perforation gauge (odontometer) to measure the perforation gauge of the stamp.

The identification of watermarks is equally important and may be done with the naked eye by turning the stamp over or holding it up to the light. If this fails then &quot;watermark fluid&quot; may be used, which &quot;wets&quot; the stamp to reveal the mark.

Other common tools include stamp catalogs, stamp stock books and stamp hinges.

==Organizations==

Philatelic organizations sprang up soon after people started collecting and studying stamps. They include local, national and international clubs and societies where collectors come together to share the various aspects of their hobby.

The world&#x27;s oldest philatelic society is the Royal Philatelic Society London, which was founded on 10 April 1869, as the Philatelic Society. In North America, the major national societies include the American Philatelic Society; the Royal Philatelic Society of Canada; and the Mexico-Elmhurst Philatelic Society, International.

Local clubs and societies have been established in many cities of the world. The International Philatelic Federation was formed in 1926 which is originally based in Zürich, Switzerland but is now known to be the world federation for philately.

<doc id="23682" wikidata="Q604141" url="?curid=23682" title="Puget Sound">
<text>Puget Sound ( ; ) is a complex estuarine system of interconnected marine waterways and basins located on the northwest coast of the U.S. state of Washington. As a part of the Salish Sea, the sound has one major and two minor connections to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which in turn connects to the open Pacific Ocean. The major connection is Admiralty Inlet; the minor connections are Deception Pass and the Swinomish Channel.

Puget Sound extends approximately from Deception Pass in the north to Olympia in the south. Its average depth is and its maximum depth, off Jefferson Point between Indianola and Kingston, is . The depth of the main basin, between the southern tip of Whidbey Island and Tacoma, is approximately .

In 2009, the term Salish Sea was established by the United States Board on Geographic Names as the collective waters of Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the Strait of Georgia. Sometimes the terms &quot;Puget Sound&quot; and &quot;Puget Sound and adjacent waters&quot; are used for not only Puget Sound proper but also for waters to the north, such as Bellingham Bay and the San Juan Islands region.

The term &quot;Puget Sound&quot; is used not just for the body of water but also the Puget Sound region centered on the sound. Major cities on the sound include Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, and Everett. Puget Sound is also the second-largest estuary in the United States, after Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia.

==Names==
In 1792, George Vancouver gave the name &quot;Puget&#x27;s Sound&quot; to the waters south of the Tacoma Narrows, in honor of Peter Puget, a Huguenot lieutenant accompanying him on the Vancouver Expedition. This name later came to be used for the waters north of Tacoma Narrows as well.

An alternative term for Puget Sound, used by a number of Native Americans and environmental groups, is Whulge (or Whulj), an anglicization of the Lushootseed name for Puget Sound, , which literally means &quot;sea, salt water, ocean, or sound&quot;. The name for the Lushootseed language, , is derived from the root word , an alternative name for Puget Sound.

==Definitions==
The USGS defines Puget Sound as all the waters south of three entrances from the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The main entrance at Admiralty Inlet is defined as a line between Point Wilson on the Olympic Peninsula, and Point Partridge on Whidbey Island. The second entrance is at Deception Pass along a line from West Point on Whidbey Island, to Deception Island, then to Rosario Head on Fidalgo Island. The third entrance is at the south end of the Swinomish Channel, which connects Skagit Bay and Padilla Bay. Under this definition, Puget Sound includes the waters of Hood Canal, Admiralty Inlet, Possession Sound, Saratoga Passage, and others. It does not include Bellingham Bay, Padilla Bay, the waters of the San Juan Islands or anything farther north.

Another definition, given by NOAA, subdivides Puget Sound into five basins or regions. Four of these (including South Puget Sound) correspond to areas within the USGS definition, but the fifth, called &quot;Northern Puget Sound&quot; includes a large additional region. It is defined as bounded to the north by the international boundary with Canada, and to the west by a line running north from the mouth of the Sekiu River on the Olympic Peninsula. Under this definition, significant parts of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia are included in Puget Sound, with the international boundary marking an abrupt and hydrologically arbitrary limit.

According to Arthur Kruckeberg, the term &quot;Puget Sound&quot; is sometimes used for waters north of Admiralty Inlet and Deception Pass, especially for areas along the north coast of Washington and the San Juan Islands, essentially equivalent to NOAA&#x27;s &quot;Northern Puget Sound&quot; subdivision described above. Kruckeberg uses the term &quot;Puget Sound and adjacent waters&quot;. Kruckeberg&#x27;s 1991 text, however, does not reflect the 2009 decision of the United States Board on Geographic Names to use the term Salish Sea to refer to the greater maritime environment.

== Geology ==
Continental ice sheets have repeatedly advanced and retreated from the Puget Sound region. The most recent glacial period, called the Fraser Glaciation, had three phases, or stades. During the third, or Vashon Glaciation, a lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, called the Puget Lobe, spread south about 15,000 years ago, covering the Puget Sound region with an ice sheet about thick near Seattle, and nearly at the present Canada-U.S. border. Since each new advance and retreat of ice erodes away much of the evidence of previous ice ages, the most recent Vashon phase has left the clearest imprint on the land. At its maximum extent the Vashon ice sheet extended south of Olympia to near Tenino, and covered the lowlands between the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges. About 14,000 years ago the ice began to retreat. By 11,000 years ago it survived only north of the Canada–US border.

The melting retreat of the Vashon Glaciation eroded the land, creating a drumlin field of hundreds of aligned drumlin hills. Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish (which are ribbon lakes), Hood Canal, and the main Puget Sound basin were altered by glacial forces. These glacial forces are not specifically &quot;carving&quot;, as in cutting into the landscape via the mechanics of ice/glaciers, but rather eroding the landscape from melt water of the Vashon Glacier creating the drumlin field. As the ice retreated, vast amounts of glacial till were deposited throughout the Puget Sound region. The soils of the region, less than ten thousand years old, are still characterized as immature.

As the Vashon glacier receded a series of proglacial lakes formed, filling the main trough of Puget Sound and inundating the southern lowlands. Glacial Lake Russell was the first such large recessional lake. From the vicinity of Seattle in the north the lake extended south to the Black Hills, where it drained south into the Chehalis River. Sediments from Lake Russell form the blue-gray clay identified as the Lawton Clay. The second major recessional lake was Glacial Lake Bretz. It also drained to the Chehalis River until the , in the northeast Olympic Peninsula, melted, allowing the lake&#x27;s water to rapidly drain north into the marine waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which was rising as the ice sheet retreated.

As icebergs calved off the toe of the glacier, their embedded gravels and boulders were deposited in the chaotic mix of unsorted till geologists call &quot;glaciomarine drift.&quot; Many beaches about the Sound display glacial erratics, rendered more prominent than those in coastal woodland solely by their exposed position; submerged glacial erratics sometimes cause hazards to navigation. The sheer weight of glacial-age ice depressed the landforms, which experienced post-glacial rebound after the ice sheets had retreated. Because the rate of rebound was not synchronous with the post-ice age rise in sea levels, the bed of what is now Puget Sound filled alternately with fresh and with sea water. The upper level of the lake-sediment Lawton Clay now lies about above sea level.
The Puget Sound system consists of four deep basins connected by shallower sills. The four basins are Hood Canal, west of the Kitsap Peninsula, Whidbey Basin, east of Whidbey Island, South Sound, south of the Tacoma Narrows, and the Main Basin, which is further subdivided into Admiralty Inlet and the Central Basin. Puget Sound&#x27;s sills, a kind of submarine terminal moraine, separate the basins from one another, and Puget Sound from the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Three sills are particularly significant—the one at Admiralty Inlet which checks the flow of water between the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound, the one at the entrance to Hood Canal (about below the surface), and the one at the Tacoma Narrows (about ). Other sills that present less of a barrier include the ones at Blake Island, Agate Pass, Rich Passage, and Hammersley Inlet.

The depth of the basins is a result of the Sound being part of the Cascadia subduction zone, where the terranes accreted at the edge of the Juan de Fuca Plate are being subducted under the North American Plate. There has not been a major subduction zone earthquake here since the magnitude nine Cascadia earthquake; according to Japanese records, it occurred on January 26, 1700. Lesser Puget Sound earthquakes with shallow epicenters, caused by the fracturing of stressed oceanic rocks as they are subducted, still cause great damage. The Seattle Fault cuts across Puget Sound, crossing the southern tip of Bainbridge Island and under Elliott Bay. To the south, the existence of a second fault, the Tacoma Fault, has buckled the intervening strata in the Seattle Uplift.

Typical Puget Sound profiles of dense glacial till overlying permeable glacial outwash of gravels above an impermeable bed of silty clay may become unstable after periods of unusually wet weather and slump in landslides.

==Hydrology==

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) defines Puget Sound as a bay with numerous channels and branches; more specifically, it is a fjord system of flooded glacial valleys. Puget Sound is part of a larger physiographic structure termed the Puget Trough, which is a physiographic section of the larger Pacific Border province, which in turn is part of the larger Pacific Mountain System.

Puget Sound is a large salt water estuary, or system of many estuaries, fed by highly seasonal freshwater from the Olympic and Cascade Mountain watersheds. The mean annual river discharge into Puget Sound is , with a monthly average maximum of about and minimum of about . Puget Sound&#x27;s shoreline is long, encompassing a water area of and a total volume of at mean high water. The average volume of water flowing in and out of Puget Sound during each tide is . The maximum tidal currents, in the range of 9 to 10 knots, occurs at Deception Pass. Water flow through Deception Pass is approximately equal to 2% of the total tidal exchange between Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

The size of Puget Sound&#x27;s watershed is . &quot;Northern Puget Sound&quot; is frequently considered part of the Puget Sound watershed, which enlarges its size to . The USGS uses the name &quot;Puget Sound&quot; for its hydrologic unit subregion 1711, which includes areas draining to Puget Sound proper as well as the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the Strait of Georgia, and the Fraser River. Significant rivers that drain to &quot;Northern Puget Sound&quot; include the Nooksack, Dungeness, and Elwha Rivers. The Nooksack empties into Bellingham Bay, the Dungeness and Elwha into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The Chilliwack River flows north to the Fraser River in Canada.

Tides in Puget Sound are of the mixed type with two high and two low tides each tidal day. These are called Higher High Water (HHW), Lower Low Water (LLW), Lower High Water (LHW), and Higher Low Water (HLW). The configuration of basins, sills, and interconnections cause the tidal range to increase within Puget Sound. The difference in height between the Higher High Water and the Lower Low Water averages about at Port Townsend on Admiralty Inlet, but increases to about at Olympia, the southern end of Puget Sound.

Puget Sound is generally accepted as the start of the Inside Passage.

==Flora and fauna==

Important marine flora of Puget Sound include eelgrass (&quot;Zostera marina&quot;) and various kelp, important kelps include canopy forming bull kelp (&quot;Nereocystis luetkeana&quot;). and edible kelps like kombu (&quot;Saccharina latissima)

Among the marine mammals species found in Puget Sound are harbor seals (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;). Orca (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;), or &quot;killer whales&quot; are famous throughout the Sound, and are a large tourist attraction. Although orca are sometimes seen in Puget Sound proper they are far more prevalent around the San Juan Islands north of Puget Sound.

Many fish species occur in Puget Sound. The various salmonid species, including salmon, trout, and char are particularly well-known and studied. Salmonid species of Puget Sound include chinook salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;), chum salmon (&quot;O. keta&quot;), coho salmon (&quot;O. kisutch&quot;), pink salmon (&quot;O. gorbuscha&quot;), sockeye salmon (&quot;O. nerka&quot;), sea-run coastal cutthroat trout (&quot;O. clarki clarki&quot;), steelhead (&quot;O. mykiss irideus&quot;), sea-run bull trout (&quot;Salvelinus confluentus&quot;), and Dolly Varden trout (&quot;Salvelinus malma malma&quot;).

Common forage fishes found in Puget Sound include Pacific herring (&quot;Clupea pallasii&quot;), surf smelt (&quot;Hypomesus pretiosus&quot;), and Pacific sand lance (&quot;Ammodytes hexapterus&quot;). Important benthopelagic fish of Puget Sound include North Pacific hake (&quot;Merluccius productus&quot;), Pacific cod (&quot;Gadus macrocelhalus&quot;), walleye pollock (&quot;Theragra chalcogramma&quot;), and the spiny dogfish (&quot;Squalus acanthias&quot;). There are about 28 species of Sebastidae (rockfish), of many types, found in Puget Sound. Among those of special interest are copper rockfish (&quot;Sebastes caurinus&quot;), quillback rockfish (&quot;S. maliger&quot;), black rockfish (&quot;S. melanops&quot;), yelloweye rockfish (&quot;S. ruberrimus&quot;), bocaccio rockfish (&quot;S. paucispinis&quot;), canary rockfish (&quot;S. pinniger&quot;), and Puget Sound rockfish (&quot;S. emphaeus&quot;).

Many other fish species occur in Puget Sound, such as sturgeons, lampreys, various sharks, rays, and skates.

Puget Sound is home to numerous species of marine invertebrates, including sponges, sea anemones, chitons, clams, sea snails, limpets, crabs, barnacles, starfish, sea urchins, and sand dollars. Dungeness crabs (&quot;Metacarcinus magister&quot;) occur throughout Washington waters, including Puget Sound. Many bivalves occur in Puget Sound, such as Pacific oysters (&quot;Crassostrea gigas&quot;) and geoduck clams (&quot;Panopea generosa&quot;). The Olympia oyster (&quot;Ostreola conchaphila&quot;), once common in Puget Sound, was depleted by human activities during the 20th century. There are ongoing efforts to restore Olympia oysters in Puget Sound.

In 1967, an initial scuba survey estimated that were &quot;about 110 million pounds of geoducks&quot; (pronounced &quot;gooey ducks&quot;) situated in Puget Sound&#x27;s sediments. Also known as &quot;king clam&quot;, geoducks are considered to be a delicacy in Asian countries.

There are many seabird species of Puget Sound. Among these are grebes such as the western grebe (&quot;Aechmophorus occidentalis&quot;); loons such as the common loon (&quot;Gavia immer&quot;); auks such as the pigeon guillemot (&quot;Cepphus columba&quot;), rhinoceros auklet (&quot;Cerorhinca monocerata&quot;), common murre (&quot;Uria aalge&quot;), and marbled murrelet (&quot;Brachyramphus marmoratus&quot;); the brant goose (&quot;Branta bernicla&quot;); seaducks such as the long-tailed duck (&quot;Clangula hyemalis&quot;), harlequin duck (&quot;Histrionicus histrionicus&quot;), and surf scoter (&quot;Melanitta perspicillata&quot;); and cormorants such as the double-crested cormorant (&quot;Phalacrocorax auritus&quot;). Puget Sound is home to a non-migratory and marine-oriented subspecies of great blue herons (&quot;Ardea herodias fannini&quot;). Bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) occur in relative high densities in the Puget Sound region.

==History==
Puget Sound has been home to many Indigenous peoples, such as the Lushootseed-speaking peoples, as well as the Twana, Chimakum, and Klallam, for millennia. The earliest known presence of Indigenous inhabitants in the Puget Sound region is between 14,000 BCE to 6,000 BCE.
Dispatched in an attempt to locate the fabled Northwest Passage, British Royal Navy captain George Vancouver anchored on May 19, 1792, on the shores of Seattle, explored Puget Sound, and claimed it for Great Britain on June 4 the same year, naming it for one of his officers, Lieutenant Peter Puget. He further named the entire region; &quot;New Georgia&quot;, after King George III.
After 1818 Britain and the United States, which both claimed the Oregon Country, agreed to &quot;joint occupancy&quot;, deferring resolution of the Oregon boundary dispute. The Puget Sound Agricultural Company was formed 
by HBC to encorage settlement. Pursuant to the 1846 Oregon Treaty; Puget Sound which was part of the disputed region became US territory.

American maritime fur traders visited Puget Sound in the early 19th century.

An Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company expedition led by James McMillan in late 1824 was first non-Indigenous group to enter Puget Sound since George Vancouver in 1792. The expedition went on to reach the Fraser River, first again to reach the lower Fraser since Fraser himself in 1808.

The first non-Indigenous settlement in the Puget Sound area was Fort Nisqually, a fur trade post of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) built in 1833. Fort Nisqually was part of the HBC&#x27;s Columbia District, headquartered at Fort Vancouver. In 1838, the HBC&#x27;s subsidy operation, the Puget Sound Agricultural Company was established in part to procure resources and trade, as well as to further establish British claim to the region. Missionaries J.P. Richmond and W.H. Wilson were attending Fort Nisqually for two years by 1840. British ships, such as the &quot;Beaver&quot;, exported foodstuffs and provisions from Fort Nisqually, and would eventually export Puget Sound lumber, an industry that would soon outpace the dominant fur trading market and drive the early Puget Sound economy.

The first organized American expedition took place under the helm of Commander Charles Wilkes, whose exploring party sailed up Puget Sound in 1841. The first permanent American settlement on Puget Sound was Tumwater, founded in 1845 by Americans who had come via the Oregon Trail. The decision to settle north of the Columbia River was made in part because one of the settlers, George Washington Bush, was considered black and the Provisional Government of Oregon banned the residency of mulattoes but did not actively enforce the restriction north of the river.
In 1853 Washington Territory was formed from part of Oregon Territory. In 1888 the Northern Pacific railroad line reached Puget Sound, linking the region to eastern states. Washington State was admitted to the union in 1889 as part of the Enabling Act, and the regions borders have since remained unchanged.

==Transportation==
The Washington State Ferries (WSF) are a state-run ferry system that connects the larger islands of Puget Sound the Washington mainland, and the Olympic and Kitsap Peninsulas. Its vessels carry both passengers and vehicular traffic. The system averaged 24.3 million passengers in the 2010s and 17.2 in 2022 with the COVID-19 pandemic. It is the largest ferry operator in the United States.

==Environmental issues==
Over the past 30 years, as the region&#x27;s human population has increased, there has been a correlating decrease in various plant and animal species which inhabit Puget Sound. The decline has been seen in numerous populations including forage fish, salmonids, bottom fish, marine birds, harbor porpoise, and orcas. The decline is attributed to various issues, including human population growth, pollution, and climate change. Because of this population decline, there have been changes to the fishery practices, and an increase in petitioning to add species to the Endangered Species Act. There has also been an increase in recovery and management plans for many different area species.
The causes of these environmental issues are toxic contamination, eutrophication (low oxygen due to excess nutrients), and near shore habitat changes.

On May 22, 1978, a valve was mistakenly opened aboard the submarine USS &quot;Puffer&quot;, releasing up to 500 US gallons (1,900 L; 420 imp gal) of radioactive water into Puget Sound, during an overhaul in drydock at Bremerton Naval Shipyard.

<text>Perjury (also known as foreswearing) is the intentional act of swearing a false oath or falsifying an affirmation to tell the truth, whether spoken or in writing, concerning matters material to an official proceeding. 

Like most other crimes in the common law system, to be convicted of perjury one must have had the &quot;intention&quot; (&quot;mens rea&quot;) to commit the act and have &quot;actually committed&quot; the act (&quot;actus reus&quot;). Further, statements that &quot;are facts&quot; cannot be considered perjury, even if they might arguably constitute an omission, and it is not perjury to lie about matters that are immaterial to the legal proceeding. Statements that entail an &quot;interpretation&quot; of fact are not perjury because people often draw inaccurate conclusions unwittingly or make honest mistakes without the intent to deceive. Individuals may have honest but mistaken beliefs about certain facts or their recollection may be inaccurate, or may have a different perception of what is the accurate way to state the truth. In some jurisdictions, no crime has occurred when a false statement is (intentionally or unintentionally) made while under oath or subject to penalty. Instead, criminal culpability attaches only at the instant the declarant falsely asserts the truth of statements (made or to be made) that are material to the outcome of the proceeding. It is not perjury, for example, to lie about one&#x27;s age except if age is a fact material to influencing the legal result, such as eligibility for old age retirement benefits or whether a person was of an age to have legal capacity.

Perjury is considered a serious offence, as it can be used to usurp the power of the courts, resulting in miscarriages of justice. In Canada, those who commit perjury are guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years. Perjury is a statutory offence in England and Wales. A person convicted of perjury is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years, or to a fine, or to both. In the United States, the general perjury statute under federal law classifies perjury as a felony and provides for a prison sentence of up to five years. The California Penal Code allows for perjury to be a capital offense in cases causing wrongful execution. Perjury which caused the wrongful execution of another or in the pursuit of causing the wrongful execution of another is respectively construed as murder or attempted murder, and is normally itself punishable by execution in countries that retain the death penalty. Perjury is considered a felony in most U.S. states. However, prosecutions for perjury are rare.

The rules for perjury also apply when a person has made a statement &quot;under penalty of perjury&quot; even if the person has not been sworn or affirmed as a witness before an appropriate official. An example is the US income tax return, which, by law, must be signed as true and correct under penalty of perjury (see ). Federal tax law provides criminal penalties of up to three years in prison for violation of the tax return perjury statute. See: 

In the United States, Kenya, Scotland and several other English-speaking Commonwealth nations, subornation of perjury, which is attempting to induce another person to commit perjury, is itself a crime.

== Perjury law by jurisdiction ==
===Australia===
Perjury is punishable by imprisonment in various states and territories of Australia. In several jurisdictions, longer prison sentences are possible if perjury was committed with the intent of convicting or acquitting a person charged with a serious offence.

* Australian Capital Territory: Perjury is punishable by a fine of up to AU$112,000 or 7 years imprisonment or both. If perjury was committed with the intent of convicting or acquitting someone of an offence which carries a prison sentence, the maximum penalty is AU$224,000 or 14 years imprisonment or both.

* New South Wales: Under Section 327 of the Crimes Act 1900, perjury is punishable by imprisonment of up to 10 years. Under Section 328, if a person commits perjury with the aim of convicting or acquitting a person charged with an offence that carries a prison sentence of 5 years or more, perjury is punishable by imprisonment of up to 14 years.

* Northern Territory: Perjury is punishable by imprisonment of up to 14 years. If perjury was committed to convict someone of an offence that carries life imprisonment, the perjurer can be imprisoned for life.

* Queensland: Perjury is punishable by imprisonment of up to 14 years. If perjury was committed to convict someone of an offence that carries life imprisonment, the perjurer can be imprisoned for life.

* South Australia: Perjury and subornation of perjury is punishable by imprisonment of up to 7 years.

* Tasmania: Perjury is a crime in Tasmania.

* Victoria: Perjury and subornation of perjury is punishable by imprisonment of up to 15 years.

* Western Australia: Under Section 125 of the Criminal Code Act Compilation Act 1913, perjury is punishable by imprisonment of up to 14 years. If perjury was committed to convict someone of an offence that carries life imprisonment, the perjurer can be imprisoned for life.

===Canada===
The offence of perjury is codified by section 132 of the Criminal Code. It is defined by section 131, which provides:

As to corroboration, see section 133.

Everyone who commits perjury is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.

===European Union===
A person who, before the Court of Justice of the European Union, swears anything which they know to be false or do not believe to be true are, whatever their nationality, guilty of perjury. Proceedings for this offence may be taken in any place in the State and the offence may for all incidental purposes be treated as having been committed in that place.

===India===

&quot;The offence of perjury finds its place in law by virtue of Section 191 to Section 203 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (&#x27;IPC&#x27;). Unlike many other countries, the offence of perjury is muted on account of Section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (&quot;Cr.P.C&quot;). Section 195(1)(b)(i) of the Cr.P.C. restricts any court to take cognisance of an offence of perjury unless the same is by way of a complaint in writing by the court before which the offence is committed or by a superior court.&quot;

===New Zealand===
Punishment for perjury is defined under Section 109 of the Crimes Act 1961. A person who commits perjury may be imprisoned for up to 7 years. If a person commits perjury to procure the conviction of someone charged with an offence that carries a maximum sentence of not less than 3 years&#x27; imprisonment, the perjurer may be imprisoned for up to 14 years.

===Nigeria===
===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
Perjury is a statutory offence in England and Wales. It is created by section 1(1) of the Perjury Act 1911. Section 1 of that Act reads:

The words omitted from section 1(1) were repealed by section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1948.

A person guilty of an offence under section 11(1) of the European Communities Act 1972 (i.e. perjury before the Court of Justice of the European Union) may be proceeded against and punished in England and Wales as for an offence under section 1(1).

Section 1(4) has effect in relation to proceedings in the Court of Justice of the European Union as it has effect in relation to a judicial proceeding in a tribunal of a foreign state.

Section 1(4) applies in relation to proceedings before a relevant convention court under the European Patent Convention as it applies to a judicial proceeding in a tribunal of a foreign state.

A statement made on oath by a witness outside the United Kingdom and given in evidence through a live television link by virtue of section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 must be treated for the purposes of section 1 as having been made in the proceedings in which it is given in evidence.

Section 1 applies in relation to a person acting as an intermediary as it applies in relation to a person lawfully sworn as an interpreter in a judicial proceeding; and for this purpose, where a person acts as an intermediary in any proceeding which is not a judicial proceeding for the purposes of section 1, that proceeding must be taken to be part of the judicial proceeding in which the witness&#x27;s evidence is given.

Where any statement made by a person on oath in any proceeding which is not a judicial proceeding for the purposes of section 1 is received in evidence in pursuance of a special measures direction, that proceeding must be taken for the purposes of section 1 to be part of the judicial proceeding in which the statement is so received in evidence.

=====Judicial proceeding=====

The definition in section 1(2) is not &quot;comprehensive&quot;.

The book &quot;Archbold&quot; says that it appears to be immaterial whether the court before which the statement is made has jurisdiction in the particular cause in which the statement is made, because there is no express requirement in the Act that the court be one of &quot;competent jurisdiction&quot; and because the definition in section 1(2) does not appear to require this by implication either.

=====&quot;Actus reus&quot;=====
The &quot;actus reus&quot; of perjury might be considered to be the making of a statement, whether true or false, on oath in a judicial proceeding, where the person knows the statement to be false or believes it to be false.

Perjury is a conduct crime.

=====Mode of trial=====

Perjury is triable only on indictment.

=====Sentence=====

A person convicted of perjury is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years, or to a fine, or to both.

The following cases are relevant:
*&quot;R v Hall&quot; (1982) 4 Cr App R (S) 153
*&quot;R v Knight&quot;, 6 Cr App R (S) 31, [1984] Crim LR 304, CA
*&quot;R v Healey&quot; (1990) 12 Cr App R (S) 297
*&quot;R v Dunlop&quot; [2001] 2 Cr App R (S) 27
*&quot;R v Archer&quot; [2002] EWCA Crim 1996, [2003] 1 Cr App R (S) 86
*&quot;R v Adams&quot; [2004] 2 Cr App R (S) 15
*&quot;R v Cunningham&quot; [2007] 2 Cr App R (S) 61

See also the Crown Prosecution Service sentencing manual.

=====History=====
In Anglo-Saxon legal procedure, the offence of perjury could only be committed by both jurors and by compurgators. With time witnesses began to appear in court they were not so treated despite the fact that their functions were akin to that of modern witnesses. This was due to the fact that their role were not yet differentiated from those of the juror and so evidence or perjury by witnesses was not made a crime. Even in the 14th century, when witnesses started appearing before the jury to testify, perjury by them was not made a punishable offence. The maxim then was that every witness&#x27;s evidence on oath was true. Perjury by witnesses began to be punished before the end of the 15th century by the Star Chamber.

The immunity enjoyed by witnesses began also to be whittled down or interfered with by the Parliament in England in 1540 with subornation of perjury and, in 1562, with perjury proper. The punishment for the offence then was in the nature of monetary penalty, recoverable in a civil action and not by penal sanction. In 1613, the Star Chamber declared perjury by a witness to be a punishable offence at common law.

Prior to the 1911 Act, perjury was governed by section 3 of the Maintenance and Embracery Act 1540 5 Eliz 1 c. 9 (; repealed 1967) and the Perjury Act 1728.

=====Materiality=====

The requirement that the statement be material can be traced back to and has been credited to Edward Coke, who said:

====Northern Ireland====
Perjury is a statutory offence in Northern Ireland. It is created by article 3(1) of the Perjury (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 (S.I. 1979/1714 (N.I. 19)). This replaces the Perjury Act (Northern Ireland) 1946 (c. 13) (N.I.).

=== United States ===
Perjury operates in American law as an inherited principle of the common law of England, which defined the act as the &quot;willful and corrupt giving, upon a lawful oath, or in any form allowed by law to be substituted for an oath, in a judicial proceeding or course of justice, of a false testimony material to the issue or matter of inquiry&quot;.

William Blackstone touched on the subject in his &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;, establishing perjury as &quot;a crime committed when a lawful oath is administered, in some judicial proceeding, to a person who swears willfully, absolutely, and falsely, in a matter material to the issue or point in question&quot;. The punishment for perjury under the common law has varied from death to banishment and has included such grotesque penalties as severing the tongue of the perjurer. The definitional structure of perjury provides an important framework for legal proceedings, as the component parts of this definition have permeated jurisdictional lines, finding a home in American legal constructs. As such, the main tenets of perjury, including mens rea, a lawful oath, occurring during a judicial proceeding, a false testimony have remained necessary pieces of perjury&#x27;s definition in the United States.

====Statutory definitions====
Perjury&#x27;s current position in the American legal system takes the form of state and federal statutes. Most notably, the United States Code prohibits perjury, which is defined in two senses for federal purposes as someone who:

The above statute provides for a fine and/or up to five years in prison as punishment. Within federal jurisdiction, statements made in two broad categories of judicial proceedings may qualify as perjurious: 1) Federal official proceedings, and 2) Federal Court or Grand Jury proceedings. A third type of perjury entails the procurement of perjurious statements from another person. More generally, the statement must occur in the &quot;course of justice,&quot; but this definition leaves room open for interpretation.

One particularly precarious aspect of the phrasing is that it entails knowledge of the accused person&#x27;s perception of the truthful nature of events and not necessarily the actual truth of those events. It is important to note the distinction here, between giving a false statement under oath and merely misstating a fact accidentally, but the distinction can be especially difficult to discern in court of law.

====Precedents====
The development of perjury law in the United States centers on &quot;United States v. Dunnigan&quot;, a seminal case that set out the parameters of perjury within United States law. The court uses the Dunnigan-based legal standard to determine if an accused person: &quot;testifying under oath or affirmation violates this section if she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.&quot; However, a defendant shown to be willfully ignorant may in fact be eligible for perjury prosecution.

&quot;Dunnigan&quot; distinction manifests its importance with regard to the relation between two component parts of perjury&#x27;s definition: in willfully giving a false statement, a person must understand that she is giving a false statement to be considered a perjurer under the &quot;Dunnigan&quot; framework. Deliberation on the part of the defendant is required for a statement to constitute perjury. Jurisprudential developments in the American law of perjury have revolved around the facilitation of &quot;perjury prosecutions and thereby enhance the reliability of testimony before federal courts and grand juries&quot;.

With that goal in mind, Congress has sometimes expanded the grounds on which an individual may be prosecuted for perjury, with section 1623 of the United States Code recognizing the utterance of two mutually incompatible statements as grounds for perjury indictment even if neither can unequivocally be proven false. However, the two statements must be so mutually incompatible that at least one must necessarily be false; it is irrelevant whether the false statement can be specifically identified from among the two. It thus falls on the government to show that a defendant (a) knowingly made a (b) false (c) material statement (d) under oath (e) in a legal proceeding. The proceedings can be ancillary to normal court proceedings, and thus, even such menial interactions as bail hearings can qualify as protected proceedings under this statute.

Wilfulness is an element of the offense. The mere existence of two mutually-exclusive factual statements is not sufficient to prove perjury; the prosecutor nonetheless has the duty to plead and prove that the statement was willfully made. Mere contradiction will not sustain the charge; there must be strong corroborative evidence of the contradiction.

One significant legal distinction lies in the specific realm of knowledge necessarily possessed by a defendant for her statements to be properly called perjury. Though the defendant must knowingly render a false statement in a legal proceeding or under federal jurisdiction, the defendant need not know that they are speaking under such conditions for the statement to constitute perjury. All tenets of perjury qualification persist: the &quot;knowingly&quot; aspect of telling the false statement simply does not apply to the defendant&#x27;s knowledge about the person whose deception is intended.

====Materiality====
The evolution of United States perjury law has experienced the most debate with regards to the materiality requirement. Fundamentally, statements that are literally true cannot provide the basis for a perjury charge (as they do not meet the falsehood requirement) just as answers to truly ambiguous statements cannot constitute perjury. However, such fundamental truths of perjury law become muddled when discerning the materiality of a given statement and the way in which it was material to the given case. In &quot;United States v. Brown&quot;, the court defined material statements as those with &quot;a natural tendency to influence, or is capable of influencing, the decision of the decision-making body to be addressed,&quot; such as a jury or grand jury.

While courts have specifically made clear certain instances that have succeeded or failed to meet the nebulous threshold for materiality, the topic remains unresolved in large part, except in certain legal areas where intent manifests itself in an abundantly clear fashion, such as with the so-called perjury trap, a specific situation in which a prosecutor calls a person to testify before a grand jury with the intent of drawing a perjurious statement from the person being questioned.

====Defense of recantation====
Despite a tendency of US perjury law toward broad prosecutory power under perjury statutes, American perjury law has afforded potential defendants a new form of defense not found in the British Common Law. This defense requires that an individual admit to making a perjurious statement during that same proceeding and recanting the statement. Though this defensive loophole slightly narrows the types of cases which may be prosecuted for perjury, the effect of this statutory defense is to promote a truthful retelling of facts by witnesses, thus helping to ensure the reliability of American court proceedings just as broadened perjury statutes aimed to do.

====Subornation of perjury====
Subornation of perjury stands as a subset of US perjury laws and prohibits an individual from inducing another to commit perjury. Subornation of perjury entails equivalent possible punishments as perjury on the federal level. The crime requires an extra level of satisfactory proof, as prosecutors must show not only that perjury occurred but also that the defendant positively induced said perjury. Furthermore, the inducing defendant must know that the suborned statement is a false, perjurious statement.

<text>In chemistry, a phosphate is an anion, salt, functional group or ester derived from a phosphoric acid. It most commonly means orthophosphate, a derivative of orthophosphoric acid, phosphoric acid .

The phosphate or orthophosphate ion is derived from phosphoric acid by the removal of three protons . Removal of one proton gives the dihydrogen phosphate ion while removal of two protons gives the hydrogen phosphate ion . These names are also used for salts of those anions, such as ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and trisodium phosphate.

In organic chemistry, phosphate or orthophosphate is an organophosphate, an ester of orthophosphoric acid of the form where one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by organic groups. An example is trimethyl phosphate, . The term also refers to the trivalent functional group in such esters. Phosphates may contain sulfur in place of one or more oxygen atoms (thiophosphates and organothiophosphates).

Orthophosphates are especially important among the various phosphates because of their key roles in biochemistry, biogeochemistry, and ecology, and their economic importance for agriculture and industry. The addition and removal of phosphate groups (phosphorylation and dephosphorylation) are key steps in cell metabolism.

Orthophosphates can condense to form pyrophosphates.

==Chemical properties==
The phosphate ion has a molar mass of 94.97 g/mol, and consists of a central phosphorus atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. It is the conjugate base of the hydrogen phosphate ion , which in turn is the conjugate base of the dihydrogen phosphate ion , which in turn is the conjugate base of orthophosphoric acid, .

Many phosphates are soluble in water at standard temperature and pressure. The sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and ammonium phosphates are all water-soluble. Most other phosphates are only slightly soluble or are insoluble in water. As a rule, the hydrogen and dihydrogen phosphates are slightly more soluble than the corresponding phosphates.

===Equilibria in solution===

In water solution, orthophosphoric acid and its three derived anions coexist according to the dissociation and recombination equilibria below

Values are at 25°C and 0 ionic strength.

The p&quot;K&quot;&quot;a&quot; values are the pH values where the concentration of each species is equal to that of its conjugate bases. At pH 1 or lower, the phosphoric acid is practically undissociated. Around pH 4.7 (mid-way between the first two p&quot;K&quot;&quot;a&quot; values) the dihydrogen phosphate ion, , is practically the only species present. Around pH 9.8 (mid-way between the second and third p&quot;K&quot;&quot;a&quot; values) the monohydrogen phosphate ion, , is the only species present. At pH 13 or higher, the acid is completely dissociated as the phosphate ion, .

This means that salts of the mono- and di-phosphate ions can be selectively crystallised from aqueous solution by setting the pH value to either 4.7 or 9.8.

In effect, , and behave as separate weak acids because the successive p&quot;K&quot;&quot;a&quot; differ by more than 4.

Phosphate can form many polymeric ions such as pyrophosphate, , and triphosphate, . The various metaphosphate ions (which are usually long linear polymers) have an empirical formula of and are found in many compounds.

===Biochemistry of phosphates===

In biological systems, phosphorus can be found as free phosphate anions in solution (inorganic phosphate) or bound to organic molecules as various organophosphates.

Inorganic phosphate is generally denoted Pi and at physiological (homeostatic) pH primarily consists of a mixture of and ions. At a neutral pH, as in the cytosol (pH = 7.0), the concentrations of the orthophoshoric acid and its three anions have the ratios
formula_1

Thus, only and ions are present in significant amounts in the cytosol (62% , 38% ). In extracellular fluid (pH = 7.4), this proportion is inverted (61% , 39% ).

Inorganic phosphate can also be present as pyrophosphate anions , which give orthophosphate by hydrolysis:

: + H2O 2 

Organic phosphates are commonly found in the form of esters as nucleotides (e.g. AMP, ADP, and ATP) and in DNA and RNA. Free orthophosphate anions can be released by the hydrolysis of the phosphoanhydride bonds in ATP or ADP. These phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions are the immediate storage and source of energy for many metabolic processes. ATP and ADP are often referred to as high-energy phosphates, as are the phosphagens in muscle tissue. Similar reactions exist for the other nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates.

===Bones and teeth===
An important occurrence of phosphates in biological systems is as the structural material of bone and teeth. These structures are made of crystalline calcium phosphate in the form of hydroxyapatite. The hard dense enamel of mammalian teeth may contain fluoroapatite, a hydroxy calcium phosphate where some of the hydroxyl groups have been replaced by fluoride ions.

===Medical and biological research uses===
Phosphates are medicinal salts of phosphorus. Some phosphates, which help cure many urinary tract infections, are used to make urine more acidic. To avoid the development of calcium stones in the urinary tract, some phosphates are used. For patients who are unable to get enough phosphorus in their daily diet, phosphates are used as dietary supplements, usually because of certain disorders or diseases. Injectable phosphates can only be handled by qualified health care providers.

===Plant metabolism===
Plants take up phosphorus through several pathways: the arbuscular mycorrhizal pathway and the direct uptake pathway.

== Adverse health effects ==

Hyperphosphatemia, or a high blood level of phosphates, is associated with elevated mortality in the general population. The most common cause of hyperphosphatemia in people, dogs, and cats is kidney failure. In cases of hyperphosphatemia, limiting consumption of phosphate-rich foods, such as some meats and dairy items and foods with a high phosphate-to-protein ratio, such as soft drinks, fast food, processed foods, condiments, and other products containing phosphate-salt additives is advised. 

Phosphates induce vascular calcification, and a high concentration of phosphates in blood was found to be a predictor of cardiovascular events.

==Production==
===Geological occurrence===
Phosphates are the naturally occurring form of the element phosphorus, found in many phosphate minerals. In mineralogy and geology, phosphate refers to a rock or ore containing phosphate ions. Inorganic phosphates are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry.

The largest global producer and exporter of phosphates is Morocco. Within North America, the largest deposits lie in the Bone Valley region of central Florida, the Soda Springs region of southeastern Idaho, and the coast of North Carolina. Smaller deposits are located in Montana, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina. The small island nation of Nauru and its neighbor Banaba Island, which used to have massive phosphate deposits of the best quality, have been mined excessively. Rock phosphate can also be found in Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Western Sahara, Navassa Island, Tunisia, Togo, and Jordan, countries that have large phosphate-mining industries.

Phosphorite mines are primarily found in:
* North America: United States, especially Florida, with lesser deposits in North Carolina, Idaho, and Tennessee
* Africa: Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Tunisia, Mauritania
* Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Syria, Iran and Iraq, at the town of Akashat, near the Jordanian border.
* Central Asia: Kazakhstan
* Oceania: Australia, Makatea, Nauru, and Banaba Island

In 2007, at the current rate of consumption, the supply of phosphorus was estimated to run out in 345 years. However, some scientists thought that a &quot;peak phosphorus&quot; would occur in 30 years and Dana Cordell from Institute for Sustainable Futures said that at &quot;current rates, reserves will be depleted in the next 50 to 100 years&quot;. Reserves refer to the amount assumed recoverable at current market prices. In 2012 the USGS estimated world reserves at 71 billion tons, while 0.19 billion tons were mined globally in 2011. Phosphorus comprises 0.1% by mass of the average rock (while, for perspective, its typical concentration in vegetation is 0.03% to 0.2%), and consequently there are quadrillions of tons of phosphorus in Earth&#x27;s 3×1019-ton crust, albeit at predominantly lower concentration than the deposits counted as reserves, which are inventoried and cheaper to extract. If it is assumed that the phosphate minerals in phosphate rock are mainly hydroxyapatite and fluoroapatite, phosphate minerals contain roughly 18.5% phosphorus by weight. If phosphate rock contains around 20% of these minerals, the average phosphate rock has roughly 3.7% phosphorus by weight.

Some phosphate rock deposits, such as Mulberry in Florida, are notable for their inclusion of significant quantities of radioactive uranium isotopes. This is a concern because radioactivity can be released into surface waters from application of the resulting phosphate fertilizer.

In December 2012, Cominco Resources announced an updated JORC compliant resource of their Hinda project in Congo-Brazzaville of 531 million tons, making it the largest measured and indicated phosphate deposit in the world.

Around 2018, Norway discovered phosphate deposits almost equal to those in the rest of Earth combined.

In July 2022 China announced quotas on phosphate exportation.

The largest importers in millions of metric tons of phosphate are Brazil 3.2, India 2.9 and the USA 1.6.

===Mining===

The three principal phosphate producer countries (China, Morocco and the United States) account for about 70% of world production.

== Ecology ==

In ecological terms, because of its important role in biological systems, phosphate is a highly sought after resource. Once used, it is often a limiting nutrient in environments, and its availability may govern the rate of growth of organisms. This is generally true of freshwater environments, whereas nitrogen is more often the limiting nutrient in marine (seawater) environments. Addition of high levels of phosphate to environments and to micro-environments in which it is typically rare can have significant ecological consequences. For example, blooms in the populations of some organisms at the expense of others, and the collapse of populations deprived of resources such as oxygen (see eutrophication) can occur. In the context of pollution, phosphates are one component of total dissolved solids, a major indicator of water quality, but not all phosphorus is in a molecular form that algae can break down and consume.

Calcium hydroxyapatite and calcite precipitates can be found around bacteria in alluvial topsoil. As clay minerals promote biomineralization, the presence of bacteria and clay minerals resulted in calcium hydroxyapatite and calcite precipitates.

Phosphate deposits can contain significant amounts of naturally occurring heavy metals. Mining operations processing phosphate rock can leave tailings piles containing elevated levels of cadmium, lead, nickel, copper, chromium, and uranium. Unless carefully managed, these waste products can leach heavy metals into groundwater or nearby estuaries. Uptake of these substances by plants and marine life can lead to concentration of toxic heavy metals in food products.

<text>In mathematics, the prime number theorem (PNT) describes the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers among the positive integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs. The theorem was proved independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin in 1896 using ideas introduced by Bernhard Riemann (in particular, the Riemann zeta function).

The first such distribution found is , where is the prime-counting function (the number of primes less than or equal to &quot;N&quot;) and is the natural logarithm of . This means that for large enough , the probability that a random integer not greater than is prime is very close to . Consequently, a random integer with at most digits (for large enough ) is about half as likely to be prime as a random integer with at most digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime (), whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime (). In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first integers is roughly .

== Statement ==


Let be the prime-counting function defined to be the number of primes less than or equal to , for any real number . For example, because there are four prime numbers (2, 3, 5 and 7) less than or equal to 10. The prime number theorem then states that is a good approximation to (where log here means the natural logarithm), in the sense that the limit of the &quot;quotient&quot; of the two functions and as increases without bound is 1:
: formula_1
known as the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers. Using asymptotic notation this result can be restated as
: formula_2

This notation (and the theorem) does &quot;not&quot; say anything about the limit of the &quot;difference&quot; of the two functions as increases without bound. Instead, the theorem states that approximates in the sense that the relative error of this approximation approaches 0 as increases without bound.

The prime number theorem is equivalent to the statement that the th prime number satisfies
: formula_3
the asymptotic notation meaning, again, that the relative error of this approximation approaches 0 as increases without bound. For example, the th prime number is , and ()log() rounds to , a relative error of about 6.4%.

On the other hand, the following asymptotic relations are logically equivalent:
: formula_4

As outlined below, the prime number theorem is also equivalent to
: formula_5
where and are the first and the second Chebyshev functions respectively, and to
: formula_6
where formula_7 is the Mertens function.

== History of the proof of the asymptotic law of prime numbers ==

Based on the tables by Anton Felkel and Jurij Vega, Adrien-Marie Legendre conjectured in 1797 or 1798 that is approximated by the function , where and are unspecified constants. In the second edition of his book on number theory (1808) he then made a more precise conjecture, with and . Carl Friedrich Gauss considered the same question at age 15 or 16 &quot;in the year 1792 or 1793&quot;, according to his own recollection in 1849. In 1838 Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet came up with his own approximating function, the logarithmic integral (under the slightly different form of a series, which he communicated to Gauss). Both Legendre&#x27;s and Dirichlet&#x27;s formulas imply the same conjectured asymptotic equivalence of and stated above, although it turned out that Dirichlet&#x27;s approximation is considerably better if one considers the differences instead of quotients.

In two papers from 1848 and 1850, the Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev attempted to prove the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers. His work is notable for the use of the zeta function , for real values of the argument &quot;&quot;, as in works of Leonhard Euler, as early as 1737. Chebyshev&#x27;s papers predated Riemann&#x27;s celebrated memoir of 1859, and he succeeded in proving a slightly weaker form of the asymptotic law, namely, that if the limit as goes to infinity of exists at all, then it is necessarily equal to one. He was able to prove unconditionally that this ratio is bounded above and below by 0.92129 and 1.10555, for all sufficiently large . Although Chebyshev&#x27;s paper did not prove the Prime Number Theorem, his estimates for were strong enough for him to prove Bertrand&#x27;s postulate that there exists a prime number between and for any integer .

An important paper concerning the distribution of prime numbers was Riemann&#x27;s 1859 memoir &quot;On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude&quot;, the only paper he ever wrote on the subject. Riemann introduced new ideas into the subject, chiefly that the distribution of prime numbers is intimately connected with the zeros of the analytically extended Riemann zeta function of a complex variable. In particular, it is in this paper that the idea to apply methods of complex analysis to the study of the real function originates. Extending Riemann&#x27;s ideas, two proofs of the asymptotic law of the distribution of prime numbers were found independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin and appeared in the same year (1896). Both proofs used methods from complex analysis, establishing as a main step of the proof that the Riemann zeta function is nonzero for all complex values of the variable that have the form with .

During the 20th century, the theorem of Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin also became known as the Prime Number Theorem. Several different proofs of it were found, including the &quot;elementary&quot; proofs of Atle Selberg and Paul Erdős (1949). Hadamard&#x27;s and de la Vallée Poussin&#x27;s original proofs are long and elaborate; later proofs introduced various simplifications through the use of Tauberian theorems but remained difficult to digest. A short proof was discovered in 1980 by the American mathematician Donald J. Newman. Newman&#x27;s proof is arguably the simplest known proof of the theorem, although it is non-elementary in the sense that it uses Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem from complex analysis.

== Proof sketch ==
Here is a sketch of the proof referred to in one of Terence Tao&#x27;s lectures. Like most proofs of the PNT, it starts out by reformulating the problem in terms of a less intuitive, but better-behaved, prime-counting function. The idea is to count the primes (or a related set such as the set of prime powers) with &quot;weights&quot; to arrive at a function with smoother asymptotic behavior. The most common such generalized counting function is the Chebyshev function , defined by
: formula_8 

This is sometimes written as
: formula_9
where is the von Mangoldt function, namely
: formula_10

It is now relatively easy to check that the PNT is equivalent to the claim that
: formula_11
Indeed, this follows from the easy estimates
: formula_12
and (using big notation) for any ,
: formula_13

The next step is to find a useful representation for . Let be the Riemann zeta function. It can be shown that is related to the von Mangoldt function , and hence to , via the relation
: formula_14

A delicate analysis of this equation and related properties of the zeta function, using the Mellin transform and Perron&#x27;s formula, shows that for non-integer the equation
: formula_15
holds, where the sum is over all zeros (trivial and nontrivial) of the zeta function. This striking formula is one of the so-called explicit formulas of number theory, and is already suggestive of the result we wish to prove, since the term (claimed to be the correct asymptotic order of ) appears on the right-hand side, followed by (presumably) lower-order asymptotic terms.

The next step in the proof involves a study of the zeros of the zeta function. The trivial zeros −2, −4, −6, −8, ... can be handled separately:
: formula_16
which vanishes for large . The nontrivial zeros, namely those on the critical strip , can potentially be of an asymptotic order comparable to the main term if , so we need to show that all zeros have real part strictly less than 1.

=== Non-vanishing on Re(&quot;s&quot;) = 1 ===

To do this, we take for granted that is meromorphic in the half-plane , and is analytic there except for a simple pole at , and that there is a product formula
: formula_17
for . This product formula follows from the existence of unique prime factorization of integers, and shows that is never zero in this region, so that its logarithm is defined there and
: formula_18

Write ; then
: formula_19

Now observe the identity
: formula_20
so that
: formula_21
for all . Suppose now that . Certainly is not zero, since has a simple pole at . Suppose that and let tend to 1 from above. Since formula_22 has a simple pole at and stays analytic, the left hand side in the previous inequality tends to 0, a contradiction.

Finally, we can conclude that the PNT is heuristically true. To rigorously complete the proof there are still serious technicalities to overcome, due to the fact that the summation over zeta zeros in the explicit formula for does not converge absolutely but only conditionally and in a &quot;principal value&quot; sense. There are several ways around this problem but many of them require rather delicate complex-analytic estimates. Edwards&#x27;s book provides the details. Another method is to use Ikehara&#x27;s Tauberian theorem, though this theorem is itself quite hard to prove. D.J. Newman observed that the full strength of Ikehara&#x27;s theorem is not needed for the prime number theorem, and one can get away with a special case that is much easier to prove.

== Newman&#x27;s proof of the prime number theorem ==

D. J. Newman gives a quick proof of the prime number theorem (PNT). The proof is &quot;non-elementary&quot; by virtue of relying on complex analysis, but uses only elementary techniques from a first course in the subject: Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula, Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem and estimates of complex integrals. Here is a brief sketch of this proof. See for the complete details.

The proof uses the same preliminaries as in the previous section except instead of the function formula_23, the Chebyshev functionformula_24 is used, which is obtained by dropping some of the terms from the series for formula_23. Similar to the argument in the previous proof based on Tao&#x27;s lecture, we can show that , and for any . Thus, the PNT is equivalent to formula_26.
Likewise instead of formula_27 the function formula_28 is used, which is obtained by dropping some terms in the series for formula_27. The functions formula_30 and formula_31 differ by a function holomorphic on formula_32. Since, as was shown in the previous section, formula_22 has no zeroes on the line formula_32, formula_35 has no singularities on formula_32.

One further piece of information needed in Newman&#x27;s proof, and which is the key to the estimates in his simple method, is that formula_37 is bounded. This is proved using an ingenious and easy method due to Chebyshev.

Integration by parts shows how formula_38 and formula_39 are related. For formula_40, 
: formula_41

Newman&#x27;s method proves the PNT by showing the integral 
: formula_42
converges, and therefore the integrand goes to zero as formula_43, which is the PNT. In general, the convergence of the improper integral does not imply that the integrand goes to zero at infinity, since it may oscillate, but since formula_44 is increasing, it is easy to show in this case.

To show the convergence of formula_45, for formula_46 let 
: formula_47 and formula_48 where formula_49
then
: formula_50
which is equal to a function holomorphic on the line formula_51 .

The convergence of the integral formula_45, and thus the PNT, is proved by showing that formula_53. This involves change of order of limits since it can be written formula_54 and therefore classified as a Tauberian theorem.

The difference formula_55 is expressed using Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula and then shown to be small for formula_56 large by estimating the integrand. Fix formula_57 and formula_58 such that formula_59 is holomorphic in the region where formula_60, and let formula_61 be the boundary of this region. Since 0 is in the interior of the region, Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula gives 
: formula_62
where formula_63 is the factor introduced by Newman, which does not change the integral since formula_64 is entire and formula_65.

To estimate the integral, break the contour formula_66 into two parts, formula_67 where formula_68 and formula_69. Then formula_70where formula_71. Since formula_37, and hence formula_73, is bounded, let formula_74 be an upper bound for the absolute value of formula_75. This bound together with the estimate formula_76 for formula_77 gives that the first integral in absolute value is formula_78. The integrand over formula_79 in the second integral is entire, so by Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem, the contour formula_79 can be modified to a semicircle of radius formula_81 in the left half-plane without changing the integral, and the same argument as for the first integral gives the absolute value of the second integral is formula_78. Finally, letting formula_83 , the third integral goes to zero since formula_84 and hence formula_64 goes to zero on the contour. Combining the two estimates and the limit get
: formula_86
This holds for any formula_81 so formula_53, and the PNT follows.

== Prime-counting function in terms of the logarithmic integral ==
In a handwritten note on a reprint of his 1838 paper &quot;&quot;, which he mailed to Gauss, Dirichlet conjectured (under a slightly different form appealing to a series rather than an integral) that an even better approximation to is given by the offset logarithmic integral function , defined by
: formula_89

Indeed, this integral is strongly suggestive of the notion that the &quot;density&quot; of primes around should be . This function is related to the logarithm by the asymptotic expansion
: formula_90

So, the prime number theorem can also be written as . In fact, in another paper in 1899 de la Vallée Poussin proved that
: formula_91
for some positive constant , where is the big notation. This has been improved to
: formula_92 where formula_93.

In 2016, Timothy Trudgian proved an explicit upper bound for the difference between formula_94 and formula_95:
: formula_96
for formula_97.

The connection between the Riemann zeta function and is one reason the Riemann hypothesis has considerable importance in number theory: if established, it would yield a far better estimate of the error involved in the prime number theorem than is available today. More specifically, Helge von Koch showed in 1901 that if the Riemann hypothesis is true, the error term in the above relation can be improved to
: formula_98
(this last estimate is in fact equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis). The constant involved in the big notation was estimated in 1976 by Lowell Schoenfeld, assuming the Riemann hypothesis:
: formula_99
for all . He also derived a similar bound for the Chebyshev prime-counting function :
: formula_100
for all  . This latter bound has been shown to express a variance to mean power law (when regarded as a random function over the integers) and  noise and to also correspond to the Tweedie compound Poisson distribution. (The Tweedie distributions represent a family of scale invariant distributions that serve as foci of convergence for a generalization of the central limit theorem.) A lower bound is also derived by J. E. Littlewood, assuming the Riemann hypothesis:
: formula_101

The logarithmic integral is larger than for &quot;small&quot; values of . This is because it is (in some sense) counting not primes, but prime powers, where a power of a prime is counted as of a prime. This suggests that should usually be larger than by roughly formula_102 and in particular should always be larger than . However, in 1914, Littlewood proved that formula_103 changes sign infinitely often. The first value of where exceeds is probably around ; see the article on Skewes&#x27; number for more details. (On the other hand, the offset logarithmic integral is smaller than already for ; indeed, , while .)

== Elementary proofs ==
In the first half of the twentieth century, some mathematicians (notably G. H. Hardy) believed that there exists a hierarchy of proof methods in mathematics depending on what sorts of numbers (integers, reals, complex) a proof requires, and that the prime number theorem (PNT) is a &quot;deep&quot; theorem by virtue of requiring complex analysis. This belief was somewhat shaken by a proof of the PNT based on Wiener&#x27;s tauberian theorem, though Wiener&#x27;s proof ultimately relies on properties of the Riemann zeta function on the line formula_104, where complex analysis must be used.

In March 1948, Atle Selberg established, by &quot;elementary&quot; means, the asymptotic formula
: formula_105
where
: formula_106
for primes . By July of that year, Selberg and Paul Erdős had each obtained elementary proofs of the PNT, both using Selberg&#x27;s asymptotic formula as a starting point. These proofs effectively laid to rest the notion that the PNT was &quot;deep&quot; in that sense, and showed that technically &quot;elementary&quot; methods were more powerful than had been believed to be the case. On the history of the elementary proofs of the PNT, including the Erdős–Selberg priority dispute, see an article by Dorian Goldfeld.

There is some debate about the significance of Erdős and Selberg&#x27;s result. There is no rigorous and widely accepted definition of the notion of elementary proof in number theory, so it is not clear exactly in what sense their proof is &quot;elementary&quot;. Although it does not use complex analysis, it is in fact much more technical than the standard proof of PNT. One possible definition of an &quot;elementary&quot; proof is &quot;one that can be carried out in first-order Peano arithmetic.&quot; There are number-theoretic statements (for example, the Paris–Harrington theorem) provable using second order but not first-order methods, but such theorems are rare to date. Erdős and Selberg&#x27;s proof can certainly be formalized in Peano arithmetic, and in 1994, Charalambos Cornaros and Costas Dimitracopoulos proved that their proof can be formalized in a very weak fragment of PA, namely . However, this does not address the question of whether or not the standard proof of PNT can be formalized in PA.

A more recent &quot;elementary&quot; proof of the prime number theorem uses ergodic theory, due to Florian Richter. The prime number theorem is obtained there in an equivalent form that the Cesàro sum of the values of the Liouville function is zero. The Liouville function is formula_107 where formula_108 is the number of prime factors, with multiplicity, of the integer formula_109. Bergelson and Richter (2022) then obtain this form of the prime number theorem from an ergodic theorem which they prove:
: Let formula_110 be a compact metric space, formula_111 a continuous self-map of formula_110, and formula_113 a formula_111-invariant Borel probability measure for which formula_111 is uniquely ergodic. Then, for every formula_116,
formula_117
This ergodic theorem can also be used to give &quot;soft&quot; proofs of results related to the prime number theorem, such as the Pillai–Selberg theorem and Erdős–Delange theorem.

== Computer verifications ==
In 2005, Avigad &quot;et al.&quot; employed the Isabelle theorem prover to devise a computer-verified variant of the Erdős–Selberg proof of the PNT. This was the first machine-verified proof of the PNT. Avigad chose to formalize the Erdős–Selberg proof rather than an analytic one because while Isabelle&#x27;s library at the time could implement the notions of limit, derivative, and transcendental function, it had almost no theory of integration to speak of.

In 2009, John Harrison employed HOL Light to formalize a proof employing complex analysis. By developing the necessary analytic machinery, including the Cauchy integral formula, Harrison was able to formalize &quot;a direct, modern and elegant proof instead of the more involved &#x27;elementary&#x27; Erdős–Selberg argument&quot;.

== Prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions ==
Let denote the number of primes in the arithmetic progression that are less than . Dirichlet and Legendre conjectured, and de la Vallée Poussin proved, that if and are coprime, then
: formula_118
where is Euler&#x27;s totient function. In other words, the primes are distributed evenly among the residue classes modulo with  . This is stronger than Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions (which only states that there is an infinity of primes in each class) and can be proved using similar methods used by Newman for his proof of the prime number theorem.

The Siegel–Walfisz theorem gives a good estimate for the distribution of primes in residue classes.

Bennett &quot;et al.&quot;
proved the following estimate that has explicit constants and (Theorem 1.3):
Let formula_119 be an integer and let be an integer that is coprime to . Then there are positive constants and such that
: formula_120
where
: formula_121 
and
: formula_122

=== Prime number race ===
Although we have in particular
: formula_123
empirically the primes congruent to 3 are more numerous and are nearly always ahead in this &quot;prime number race&quot;; the first reversal occurs at . However Littlewood showed in 1914 that there are infinitely many sign changes for the function
: formula_124
so the lead in the race switches back and forth infinitely many times. The phenomenon that is ahead most of the time is called Chebyshev&#x27;s bias. The prime number race generalizes to other moduli and is the subject of much research; Pál Turán asked whether it is always the case that and change places when and are coprime to . Granville and Martin give a thorough exposition and survey.

Another example is the distribution of the last digit of prime numbers. Except for 2 and 5, all prime numbers end in 1, 3, 7, or 9. Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem states that asymptotically, 25% of all primes end in each of these four digits. However, empirical evidence shows that, for a given limit, there tend to be slightly more primes that end in 3 or 7 than end in 1 or 9 (a generation of the Chebyshev&#x27;s bias). This follows that 1 and 9 are quadratic residues modulo 10, and 3 and 7 are quadratic nonresidues modulo 10.

== Non-asymptotic bounds on the prime-counting function ==

The prime number theorem is an &quot;asymptotic&quot; result. It gives an ineffective bound on as a direct consequence of the definition of the limit: for all , there is an such that for all ,
: formula_125

However, better bounds on are known, for instance Pierre Dusart&#x27;s
: formula_126
The first inequality holds for all and the second one for .

The proof by de la Vallée Poussin implies the following bound: For every , there is an such that for all ,
: formula_127

The value gives a weak but sometimes useful bound for :
: formula_128

In Pierre Dusart&#x27;s thesis there are stronger versions of this type of inequality that are valid for larger . Later in 2010, Dusart proved:
: formula_129

Note that the first of these obsoletes the condition on the lower bound.

== Approximations for the &quot;n&quot;th prime number ==
As a consequence of the prime number theorem, one gets an asymptotic expression for the th prime number, denoted by :
: formula_130
A better approximation is by Cesàro (1894):
: formula_131
: formula_132

Again considering the th prime number , assuming the trailing error term is zero gives an estimate of ; the first 5 digits match and relative error is about 0.46 parts per million.

Cipolla (1902) showed that these are the leading terms of an infinite series which may be truncated at arbitrary degree, with
: formula_133
where each is a degree- monic polynomial. (, , , and so on.)

Rosser&#x27;s theorem states that 
: formula_134 
Dusart (1999). found tighter bounds using the form of the Cesàro/Cipolla approximations but varying the lowest-order constant term. is the same function as above, but with the lowest-order constant term replaced by a parameter :
: formula_135
The upper bounds can be extended to smaller by loosening the parameter. For example, for all .

Axler (2019) extended this to higher order, showing:
: formula_136
Again, the bound on may be decreased by loosening the parameter. For example, for .

== Table of &quot;π&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;x&quot; / log &quot;x&quot;, and li(&quot;x&quot;) ==
The table compares exact values of to the two approximations and . The approximation difference columns are rounded to the nearest integer, but the &quot;% error&quot; columns are computed based on the unrounded approximations. The last column, , is the average prime gap below .

The value for was originally computed assuming the Riemann hypothesis; it has since been verified unconditionally.

== Analogue for irreducible polynomials over a finite field ==
There is an analogue of the prime number theorem that describes the &quot;distribution&quot; of irreducible polynomials over a finite field; the form it takes is strikingly similar to the case of the classical prime number theorem.

To state it precisely, let be the finite field with elements, for some fixed , and let be the number of monic &quot;irreducible&quot; polynomials over whose degree is equal to . That is, we are looking at polynomials with coefficients chosen from , which cannot be written as products of polynomials of smaller degree. In this setting, these polynomials play the role of the prime numbers, since all other monic polynomials are built up of products of them. One can then prove that
: formula_137
If we make the substitution , then the right hand side is just
: formula_138
which makes the analogy clearer. Since there are precisely monic polynomials of degree (including the reducible ones), this can be rephrased as follows: if a monic polynomial of degree is selected randomly, then the probability of it being irreducible is about .

One can even prove an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis, namely that
: formula_139

The proofs of these statements are far simpler than in the classical case. It involves a short, combinatorial argument, summarised as follows: every element of the degree extension of is a root of some irreducible polynomial whose degree divides ; by counting these roots in two different ways one establishes that
: formula_140
where the sum is over all divisors of . Möbius inversion then yields
: formula_141
where is the Möbius function. (This formula was known to Gauss.) The main term occurs for , and it is not difficult to bound the remaining terms. The &quot;Riemann hypothesis&quot; statement depends on the fact that the largest proper divisor of can be no larger than .

<text>Conflict of laws (also called private international law) is the set of rules or laws a jurisdiction applies to a case, transaction, or other occurrence that has connections to more than one jurisdiction. This body of law deals with three broad topics: &quot;jurisdiction&quot;, rules regarding when it is appropriate for a court to hear such a case; &quot;foreign judgments&quot;, dealing with the rules by which a court in one jurisdiction mandates compliance with a ruling of a court in another jurisdiction; and &quot;choice of law&quot;, which addresses the question of which substantive laws will be applied in such a case. These issues can arise in any private-law context, but they are especially prevalent in contract law and tort law.

== Scope and terminology ==

The term &quot;conflict of laws&quot; is primarily used in the United States and Canada, though it has also come into use in the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, the term &quot;private international law&quot; is commonly used. Some scholars from countries that use &quot;conflict of laws&quot; consider the term &quot;private international law&quot; confusing because this body of law does not consist of laws that apply internationally, but rather is solely composed of domestic laws; the calculus only includes international law when the nation has treaty obligations (and even then, only to the extent that domestic law renders the treaty obligations enforceable). The term &quot;private international law&quot; comes from the private law/public law dichotomy in civil law systems. In this form of legal system, the term &quot;private international law&quot; does not imply an agreed upon international legal corpus, but rather refers to those portions of domestic private law that apply to international issues.

Importantly, while conflict of laws generally deals with disputes of an international nature, the applicable law itself is domestic law. This is because, unlike public international law (better known simply as &quot;international law&quot;), conflict of laws does not regulate the relation between countries but rather how individual countries regulate internally the affairs of individuals with connections to more than one jurisdiction. To be sure, as in other contexts, domestic law can be affected by international treaties to which a country is party.

Moreover, in federal republics where substantial lawmaking occurs at the subnational level—notably in the United States—issues within conflict of laws often arise in wholly domestic contexts, relating to the laws of different states (or provinces, etc.) rather than of foreign countries.

== History ==

Western legal systems first recognized a core underpinning of conflict of laws—namely, that &quot;foreign law, in appropriate instances, should be applied to foreign cases&quot;—in the twelfth century. Prior to that, the prevailing system was that of &quot;personal law&quot;, in which the laws applicable to each individual were dictated by the group to which he or she belonged. Initially, the mode of this body of law was simply to determine which jurisdiction&#x27;s law would be most fair to apply; over time, however, the law came to favor more well-defined rules. These rules were systematically summarized by law professor Bartolus de Saxoferrato in the middle of the fourteenth century, a work that came to be cited repeatedly for the next several centuries.

Later, in the seventeenth century, several Dutch legal scholars, including Christian Rodenburg, Paulus Voet, Johannes Voet, and Ulrik Huber, further expounded the jurisprudence of conflict of laws. Their key conceptual contributions were twofold: First, nations are wholly sovereign within their borders and therefore cannot be compelled to enforce foreign law in their own courts. Second, in order for international conflicts of law to work rationally, nations must exercise comity in enforcing others&#x27; laws, because it is in their mutual interest to do so.Scholars began to consider ways to resolve the question of how and when formally equal sovereign States ought to recognize each other&#x27;s authority. The doctrine of comity was introduced as one of the means to answer these questions. Comity has undergone various changes since its creation. However, it still refers to the idea that every State is sovereign; often, the most just exercise of one State&#x27;s authority is by recognizing the authority of another through the recognition and enforcement of another state&#x27;s laws and judgments. Many states continue to recognize the principle of comity as the underpinning of private international law such as in Canada. In some countries, such as the United States of America and Australia, the principle of comity is written into the State&#x27;s constitution.

In the United States, salient issues in the field of conflict of laws date back at least to the framing of the Constitution. There was concern, for example, about what body of law the newly created federal courts would apply when handling cases between parties from different states (a type of case specifically assigned to the federal courts). Within the first two decades following ratification of the Constitution, over one hundred cases dealt with these issues, though the term &quot;conflict of laws&quot; was not yet used. The Constitution created a &quot;plurilegal federal union&quot; in which conflicts are inherently abundant, and as a result, American judges encounter conflicts cases far more often—about 5,000 per year as of the mid-2010s—and have accumulated far more experience in resolving them than anywhere else in the world. 

Alongside domestic developments relating to conflict of laws, the nineteenth century also saw the beginnings of substantial international collaboration in the field. The first international meeting on the topic took place in Lima in 1887 and 1888; delegates from five South American countries attended, but failed to produce an enforceable agreement. The first major multilateral agreements on the topic of conflict of laws arose from the First South American Congress of Private International Law, which was held in Montevideo from August 1888 to February 1889. The seven South American nations represented at the Montevideo conference agreed on eight treaties, which broadly adopted the ideas of Friedrich Carl von Savigny, determining applicable law on the basis of four types of factual relations (domicile, location of object, location of transaction, location of court).

Soon after, European nations gathered for a conference in The Hague organized by Tobias Asser in 1893. This was followed by successive conferences in 1894, 1900, and 1904. Like their counterparts in Montevideo, these conferences produced several multilateral agreements on various topics within conflict of laws. Thereafter, the pace of these meetings slowed, with the next conventions occurring in 1925 and 1928. The seventh meeting at The Hague occurred in 1951, at which point the sixteen involved states established a permanent institution for international collaboration on conflict-of-laws issues. The organization is known today as the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH). , HCCH includes eighty-six member states.

As attention to the field became more widespread in the second half of the twentieth century, the European Union began to take action to harmonize conflict of laws jurisprudence across its member states. The first of these was the Brussels Convention agreed in 1968, which addressed questions of jurisdiction for cross-border cases. This was followed in 1980 by the Rome Convention, which addressed choice-of-law rules for contract disputes within EU member states. In 2009 and 2010, respectively, the EU enacted the Rome II Regulation to address choice-of-law in tort cases and the Rome III Regulation to address choice-of-law in divorce matters.

==Jurisdiction==
One of the key questions addressed within conflict of laws is the determination of when the legislature of a given jurisdiction may legislate, or the court of a given jurisdiction can properly adjudicate, regarding a matter that has extra-jurisdictional dimensions. This is known as &quot;jurisdiction&quot; (sometimes subdivided into &quot;adjudicative jurisdiction&quot;, the authority to hear a certain case, and &quot;prescriptive jurisdiction&quot;, the authority of a legislature to pass laws covering certain conduct). Like all aspects of conflict of laws, this question is in the first instance resolved by domestic law, which may or may not incorporate relevant international treaties or other supranational legal concepts. That said, relative to the other two main subtopics of conflicts of law (enforcement of judgements, and choice of law, which are both discussed below), the theory regarding jurisdiction has developed consistent international norms. This is perhaps because, unlike the other subtopics, jurisdiction relates to the particularly thorny question of when it is appropriate for a country to exercise its coercive power at all, rather that merely how it should do so.

There are five bases of jurisdiction generally recognized in international law. These are not mutually exclusive; an individual or an occurrence may be subject to simultaneous jurisdiction in more than one place. They are as follows:
* Territoriality—A country has jurisdiction to regulate whatever occurs within its territorial boundaries. Of all bases of jurisdiction, the territoriality principle garners the strongest consensus in international law (subject to various complexities relating to actions that did not obviously occur wholly in one country).
* Passive personality—A country has jurisdiction over an occurrence that harmed its national.
* Nationality (or active personality)—A country has jurisdiction over a wrong of which its national is the perpetrator.
* Protective—A country has jurisdiction to address threats to its own security (such as by pursuing counterfeiters of official documents).
* Universal—A country has jurisdiction over certain acts based on their intrinsic rejection by the international community (such as violent deprivations of basic human rights). This is the most controversial of the five bases of jurisdiction.

Countries have also developed bodies of law for adjudicating jurisdiction disputes between subnational entities. For example, in the United States, the minimum contacts rule derived from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution regulates the extent to which one state can exercise jurisdiction over people domiciled in other states, or occurrences that took place in other states.

==Choice of law==
Courts faced with a choice of law issue have a two-stage process:

#the court will apply the law of the forum (&quot;lex fori&quot;) to all procedural matters (including the choice of law rules); 
#it counts the factors that connect or link the legal issues to the laws of potentially relevant states and applies the laws that have the greatest connection, e.g. the law of nationality (&quot;lex patriae&quot;) or the law of habitual residence (&quot;lex domicilii&quot;). (See also &#x27;European Harmonization Provisions&#x27;: &quot;The concept of habitual residence is the civil law equivalent of the common law test of lex domicilii&quot;.) The court will determine the plaintiffs&#x27; legal status and capacity. The court will determine the law of the state in which land is situated (&quot;lex situs&quot;) that will be applied to determine all questions of title. The law of the place where a transaction physically takes place or of the occurrence that gave rise to the litigation (&quot;lex loci actus&quot;) will often be the controlling law selected when the matter is substantive, but the proper law has become a more common choice.

===Contracts===
Many contracts and other forms of legally binding agreement include a jurisdiction or arbitration clause specifying the parties&#x27; choice of venue for any litigation (called a forum selection clause). In the EU, this is governed by the Rome I Regulation. Choice of law clauses may specify which laws the court or tribunal should apply to each aspect of the dispute. This matches the substantive policy of freedom of contract and will be determined by the law of the state where the choice of law clause confers its competence. Oxford Professor Adrian Briggs suggests that this is doctrinally problematic as it is emblematic of &#x27;pulling oneself up by the bootstraps&#x27;.

Judges have accepted that the principle of party autonomy allows the parties to select the law most appropriate to their transaction. This judicial acceptance of subjective intent excludes the traditional reliance on objective connecting factors; it also harms consumers as vendors often impose one-sided contractual terms selecting a venue far from the buyer&#x27;s home or workplace. Contractual clauses relating to consumers, employees, and insurance beneficiaries are regulated under additional terms set out in Rome I, which may modify the contractual terms imposed by vendors.

<doc id="23698" wikidata="Q649751" url="?curid=23698" title="International Fixed Calendar">
<text>The International Fixed Calendar (also known as the Cotsworth plan, the Cotsworth calendar, the Eastman plan or the Yearal) was a proposed reform of the Gregorian calendar designed by Moses B. Cotsworth, first presented in 1902. The International Fixed Calendar divides the year into 13 months of 28 days each. A type of perennial calendar, every date is fixed to the same weekday every year. Though it was never officially adopted at the country level, the entrepreneur George Eastman instituted its use at the Eastman Kodak Company in 1928, where it was used until 1989. While it is sometimes described as &quot;the&quot; 13-month calendar or &quot;the&quot; equal-month calendar, various alternative calendar designs share these features.

== Rules ==
The calendar year has 13 months with 28 days each, divided into exactly 4 weeks (13 × 28 = 364). An extra day added as a holiday at the end of the year (after December 28, i.e. equal to December 31 Gregorian), sometimes called &quot;Year Day&quot;, does not belong to any week and brings the total to 365 days. Each year coincides with the corresponding Gregorian year, so January 1 in the Cotsworth calendar always falls on Gregorian January 1. Twelve months are named and ordered the same as those of the Gregorian calendar, except that the extra month is inserted between June and July, and called &quot;Sol&quot;. Situated in mid-summer (from the point of view of its Northern Hemisphere authors) and including the mid-year &quot;solstice&quot;, the name of the new month was chosen in homage to the sun.

Leap years in the International Fixed Calendar contain 366 days, and its occurrence follows the Gregorian rule. There is a leap year in every year whose number is divisible by 4, but not if the year number is divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. So although the year 2000 was a leap year, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were common years. The International Fixed Calendar inserts the extra day in leap years as June 29 - between Saturday June 28 and Sunday Sol 1.

Each month begins on a Sunday, and ends on a Saturday; consequently, every year begins on Sunday. Neither Year Day nor Leap Day are considered to be part of any week; they are preceded by a Saturday and are followed by a Sunday, making a long weekend. 
As a result, a particular day usually has a different day of the week in the IFC than in all traditional calendars that contain a seven-day week. The IFC is, however, almost compatible with the World Calendar in this regard, because it also starts Sunday and has the extra day at the end of the year and the leap day in the middle, except IFC leaps on Gregorian June 17 and TWC leaps two weeks later on July 1. Since this break of the ancient week cycle has been a major concern raised against its adoption, various leap week calendars have been proposed as a solution.
* The two special dates have been recorded as either the 29th day of the month ending or the 0th day of the month beginning, or, more correctly, as outside any month and week with no ordinal number.

The date for today, , using this calendar is .

The following table shows how the 13 months and extra days of the International Fixed Calendar occur in relation to the dates of the Gregorian calendar:

* In a leap year, these Gregorian dates between March and June are a day earlier. March in the Fixed Calendar always has a fixed number of days (28), and includes an eventual Gregorian February 29. The rule for finding leap years is the same in both calendars.

== History ==
Lunisolar calendars, with fixed weekdays, existed in many ancient cultures, with certain holidays always falling on the same dates of the month and days of the week.

The idea of a 13-month perennial calendar has been around since at least the middle of the 18th century. Versions of the idea differ mainly on how the months are named, and the treatment of the extra day in leap year.

The &quot;Georgian calendar&quot; was proposed in 1745 by Reverend Hugh Jones, an American colonist from Maryland writing under the pen name Hirossa Ap-Iccim. The author named the plan, and the thirteenth month, after King George II of Great Britain. The 365th day each year was to be set aside as Christmas. The treatment of leap year varied from the Gregorian rule, however, and the year would begin closer to the winter solstice. In a later version of the plan, published in 1753, the 13 months were all renamed for Christian saints.

In 1849 the French philosopher Auguste Comte (1798–1857) proposed the 13-month &quot;Positivist Calendar&quot;, naming the months: Moses, Homer, Aristotle, Archimedes, Caesar, St Paul, Charlemagne, Dante, Gutenberg, Shakespeare, Descartes, Frederic and Bichat. The days of the year were likewise dedicated to &quot;saints&quot; in the Positivist Religion of Humanity. Positivist weeks, months, and years begin with Monday instead of Sunday. Comte also reset the year number, beginning the era of his calendar (year 1) with the Gregorian year 1789. For the extra days of the year not belonging to any week or month, Comte followed the pattern of Ap-Iccim (Jones), ending each year with a festival on the 365th day, followed by a subsequent feast day occurring only in leap years.

Whether Moses Cotsworth was familiar with the 13-month plans that preceded his International Fixed Calendar is not known. He did follow Ap-Iccim (Jones) in designating the 365th day of the year as Christmas. His suggestion was that this last day of the year should be designated a Sunday, and hence, because the following day would be New Year&#x27;s Day and a Sunday also, he called it a Double Sunday. Since Cotsworth&#x27;s goal was a simplified, more &quot;rational&quot; calendar for business and industry, he would carry over all the features of the Gregorian calendar consistent with this goal, including the traditional month names, the week beginning on Sunday (still traditionally used in US, but uncommon in Europe and in the ISO week standard, starting their weeks on Monday), and the Gregorian leap-year rule.

To promote Cotsworth&#x27;s calendar reform the International Fixed Calendar League was founded in 1923, just after the plan was selected by the League of Nations as the best of 130 calendar proposals put forward. Sir Sandford Fleming, the inventor and driving force behind worldwide adoption of standard time, became the first president of the IFCL. The League opened offices in London and later in Rochester, New York. George Eastman, of the Eastman Kodak Company, became a fervent supporter of the IFC, and instituted its use at Kodak. Some organized opposition to the proposed reform came from rabbi Joseph Hertz, who objected to the way that the Jewish Sabbath would move throughout the week. Sol Bloom criticised the scheme in the House of Representatives. The International Fixed Calendar League ceased operations shortly after the calendar plan failed to win final approval of the League of Nations in 1937.

<doc id="23703" wikidata="Q155640" url="?curid=23703" title="Potential energy">
<text>In physics, potential energy is the energy of an object or system due to the body&#x27;s position relative to other objects, or the configuration of its particles. The energy is equal to the work done against any restoring forces, such as gravity or those in a spring.

The term &quot;potential energy&quot; was introduced by the 19th-century Scottish engineer and physicist William Rankine, although it has links to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle&#x27;s concept of &quot;potentiality&quot;.

Common types of potential energy include gravitational potential energy, the elastic potential energy of a deformed spring, and the electric potential energy of an electric charge and an electric field. The unit for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (symbol J).

Potential energy is associated with forces that act on a body in a way that the total work done by these forces on the body depends only on the initial and final positions of the body in space. These forces, whose total work is path independent, are called &quot;conservative forces&quot;. If the force acting on a body varies over space, then one has a &quot;force field&quot;; such a field is described by vectors at every point in space which is, in turn, called a &quot;vector field&quot;. A conservative vector field can be simply expressed as the gradient of a certain scalar function, called a &quot;scalar potential&quot;. The potential energy is related to, and can be obtained from, this potential function.

== Overview ==
There are various types of potential energy, each associated with a particular type of force. For example, the work of an elastic force is called elastic potential energy; work of the gravitational force is called gravitational potential energy; work of the Coulomb force is called electric potential energy; work of the nuclear force acting on the baryon charge is called nuclear potential energy; work of intermolecular forces is called intermolecular potential energy. Chemical potential energy, such as the energy stored in fossil fuels, is the work of the Coulomb force during rearrangement of configurations of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules. Thermal energy usually has two components: the kinetic energy of random motions of particles and the potential energy of their configuration.

Forces derivable from a potential are also called conservative forces. The work done by a conservative force is
formula_1
where formula_2 is the change in the potential energy associated with the force. The negative sign provides the convention that work done against a force field increases potential energy, while work done by the force field decreases potential energy. Common notations for potential energy are &quot;PE&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, and &quot;Ep&quot;.

Potential energy is the energy by virtue of an object&#x27;s position relative to other objects. Potential energy is often associated with restoring forces such as a spring or the force of gravity. The action of stretching a spring or lifting a mass is performed by an external force that works against the force field of the potential. This work is stored in the force field, which is said to be stored as potential energy. If the external force is removed the force field acts on the body to perform the work as it moves the body back to the initial position, reducing the stretch of the spring or causing a body to fall.

Consider a ball whose mass is dropped from height . The acceleration of free fall is approximately constant, so the weight force of the ball is constant. The product of force and displacement gives the work done, which is equal to the gravitational potential energy, thus
formula_3

The more formal definition is that potential energy is the energy difference between the energy of an object in a given position and its energy at a reference position.

From around 1840 scientists sought to define and understand energy and work.
The term &quot;potential energy&quot; was coined by William Rankine a Scottish engineer and physicist in 1853 as part of a specific effort to develop terminology. He chose the term as part of the pair &quot;actual&quot; vs &quot;potential&quot; going back to work by Aristotle. In his 1867 discussion of the same topic Rankine describes potential energy as &#x27;energy of configuration&#x27; in contrast to actual energy as &#x27;energy of activity&#x27;. Also in 1867, William Thomson introduced &quot;kinetic energy&quot; as the opposite of &quot;potential energy&quot;, asserting that all actual energy took the form of mv2. Once this hypothesis became widely accepted, the term &quot;actual energy&quot; gradually faded.

== Work and potential energy ==
Potential energy is closely linked with forces. If the work done by a force on a body that moves from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; does not depend on the path between these points (if the work is done by a conservative force), then the work of this force measured from &quot;A&quot; assigns a scalar value to every other point in space and defines a scalar potential field. In this case, the force can be defined as the negative of the vector gradient of the potential field.
If the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force is evaluated from the start to the end of the trajectory of the point of application. This means that there is a function &quot;U&quot;(x), called a &quot;potential&quot;, that can be evaluated at the two points xA and xB to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points. It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is 
formula_4
where &quot;C&quot; is the trajectory taken from A to B. Because the work done is independent of the path taken, then this expression is true for any trajectory, &quot;C&quot;, from A to B.

The function &quot;U&quot;(x) is called the potential energy associated with the applied force. Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces.

=== Derivable from a potential ===
In this section the relationship between work and potential energy is presented in more detail. The line integral that defines work along curve &quot;C&quot; takes a special form if the force F is related to a scalar field &quot;U&quot;′(x) so that
formula_5
This means that the units of &quot;U&quot;′ must be this case, work along the curve is given by
formula_6
which can be evaluated using the gradient theorem to obtain
formula_7
This shows that when forces are derivable from a scalar field, the work of those forces along a curve &quot;C&quot; is computed by evaluating the scalar field at the start point A and the end point B of the curve. This means the work integral does not depend on the path between A and B and is said to be independent of the path.

Potential energy is traditionally defined as the negative of this scalar field so that work by the force field decreases potential energy, that is
formula_8

In this case, the application of the del operator to the work function yields,
formula_9
and the force F is said to be &quot;derivable from a potential&quot;. This also necessarily implies that F must be a conservative vector field. The potential &quot;U&quot; defines a force F at every point x in space, so the set of forces is called a force field.

=== Computing potential energy ===
Given a force field F(x), evaluation of the work integral using the gradient theorem can be used to find the scalar function associated with potential energy. This is done by introducing a parameterized curve from to , and computing,
formula_10

For the force field F, let , then the gradient theorem yields,
formula_11

The power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work, or potential, in the direction of the velocity v of the point of application, that is
formula_12

Examples of work that can be computed from potential functions are gravity and spring forces.

== Potential energy for near-Earth gravity ==
For small height changes, gravitational potential energy can be computed using
formula_13
where &quot;m&quot; is the mass in kilograms, &quot;g&quot; is the local gravitational field (9.8 metres per second squared on Earth), &quot;h&quot; is the height above a reference level in metres, and &quot;U&quot; is the energy in joules.

In classical physics, gravity exerts a constant downward force on the center of mass of a body moving near the surface of the Earth. The work of gravity on a body moving along a trajectory , such as the track of a roller coaster is calculated using its velocity, , to obtain
formula_14
where the integral of the vertical component of velocity is the vertical distance. The work of gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the curve .

== Potential energy for a linear spring ==


A horizontal spring exerts a force that is proportional to its deformation in the axial or &quot;x&quot; direction. The work of this spring on a body moving along the space curve , is calculated using its velocity, , to obtain
formula_15
For convenience, consider contact with the spring occurs at , then the integral of the product of the distance &quot;x&quot; and the &quot;x&quot;-velocity, &quot;xvx&quot;, is &quot;x&quot;2/2.

The function 
formula_16
is called the potential energy of a linear spring.

Elastic potential energy is the potential energy of an elastic object (for example a bow or a catapult) that is deformed under tension or compression (or stressed in formal terminology). It arises as a consequence of a force that tries to restore the object to its original shape, which is most often the electromagnetic force between the atoms and molecules that constitute the object. If the stretch is released, the energy is transformed into kinetic energy.

== Potential energy for gravitational forces between two bodies ==

The gravitational potential function, also known as gravitational potential energy, is:
formula_17

The negative sign follows the convention that work is gained from a loss of potential energy.

=== Derivation ===

The gravitational force between two bodies of mass &quot;M&quot; and &quot;m&quot; separated by a distance &quot;r&quot; is given by Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation
formula_18
where formula_19 is a vector of length 1 pointing from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;m&quot; and &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant.

Let the mass &quot;m&quot; move at the velocity then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position to is given by
formula_20
The position and velocity of the mass &quot;m&quot; are given by
formula_21
where e&quot;r&quot; and e&quot;t&quot; are the radial and tangential unit vectors directed relative to the vector from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;m&quot;. Use this to simplify the formula for work of gravity to,
formula_22

This calculation uses the fact that
formula_23

== Potential energy for electrostatic forces between two bodies ==
The electrostatic force exerted by a charge &quot;Q&quot; on another charge &quot;q&quot; separated by a distance &quot;r&quot; is given by Coulomb&#x27;s Law
formula_24
where formula_19 is a vector of length 1 pointing from &quot;Q&quot; to &quot;q&quot; and &quot;ε&quot;0 is the vacuum permittivity.

The work &quot;W&quot; required to move &quot;q&quot; from &quot;A&quot; to any point &quot;B&quot; in the electrostatic force field is given by the potential function
formula_26

== Reference level ==
The potential energy is a function of the state a system is in, and is defined relative to that for a particular state. This reference state is not always a real state; it may also be a limit, such as with the distances between all bodies tending to infinity, provided that the energy involved in tending to that limit is finite, such as in the case of inverse-square law forces. Any arbitrary reference state could be used; therefore it can be chosen based on convenience.

Typically the potential energy of a system depends on the &quot;relative&quot; positions of its components only, so the reference state can also be expressed in terms of relative positions.

== Gravitational potential energy ==
Gravitational energy is the potential energy associated with gravitational force, as work is required to elevate objects against Earth&#x27;s gravity. The potential energy due to elevated positions is called gravitational potential energy, and is evidenced by water in an elevated reservoir or kept behind a dam. If an object falls from one point to another point inside a gravitational field, the force of gravity will do positive work on the object, and the gravitational potential energy will decrease by the same amount.

Consider a book placed on top of a table. As the book is raised from the floor to the table, some external force works against the gravitational force. If the book falls back to the floor, the &quot;falling&quot; energy the book receives is provided by the gravitational force. Thus, if the book falls off the table, this potential energy goes to accelerate the mass of the book and is converted into kinetic energy. When the book hits the floor this kinetic energy is converted into heat, deformation, and sound by the impact.

The factors that affect an object&#x27;s gravitational potential energy are its height relative to some reference point, its mass, and the strength of the gravitational field it is in. Thus, a book lying on a table has less gravitational potential energy than the same book on top of a taller cupboard and less gravitational potential energy than a heavier book lying on the same table. An object at a certain height above the Moon&#x27;s surface has less gravitational potential energy than at the same height above the Earth&#x27;s surface because the Moon&#x27;s gravity is weaker. &quot;Height&quot; in the common sense of the term cannot be used for gravitational potential energy calculations when gravity is not assumed to be a constant. The following sections provide more detail.

=== Local approximation ===
The strength of a gravitational field varies with location. However, when the change of distance is small in relation to the distances from the center of the source of the gravitational field, this variation in field strength is negligible and we can assume that the force of gravity on a particular object is constant. Near the surface of the Earth, for example, we assume that the acceleration due to gravity is a constant (standard gravity). In this case, a simple expression for gravitational potential energy can be derived using the equation for work, and the equation
formula_27

The amount of gravitational potential energy held by an elevated object is equal to the work done against gravity in lifting it. The work done equals the force required to move it upward multiplied with the vertical distance it is moved (remember ). The upward force required while moving at a constant velocity is equal to the weight, , of an object, so the work done in lifting it through a height is the product . Thus, when accounting only for mass, gravity, and altitude, the equation is:
formula_28
where is the potential energy of the object relative to its being on the Earth&#x27;s surface, is the mass of the object, is the acceleration due to gravity, and &quot;h&quot; is the altitude of the object.

Hence, the potential difference is
formula_29

=== General formula ===
However, over large variations in distance, the approximation that is constant is no longer valid, and we have to use calculus and the general mathematical definition of work to determine gravitational potential energy. For the computation of the potential energy, we can integrate the gravitational force, whose magnitude is given by Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation, with respect to the distance between the two bodies. Using that definition, the gravitational potential energy of a system of masses and at a distance using the Newtonian constant of gravitation is

formula_30

where is an arbitrary constant dependent on the choice of datum from which potential is measured. Choosing the convention that (i.e. in relation to a point at infinity) makes calculations simpler, albeit at the cost of making negative; for why this is physically reasonable, see below.

Given this formula for , the total potential energy of a system of bodies is found by summing, for all formula_31 pairs of two bodies, the potential energy of the system of those two bodies.

Considering the system of bodies as the combined set of small particles the bodies consist of, and applying the previous on the particle level we get the negative gravitational binding energy. This potential energy is more strongly negative than the total potential energy of the system of bodies as such since it also includes the negative gravitational binding energy of each body. The potential energy of the system of bodies as such is the negative of the energy needed to separate the bodies from each other to infinity, while the gravitational binding energy is the energy needed to separate all particles from each other to infinity.
formula_32
therefore,
formula_33

=== Negative gravitational energy ===
As with all potential energies, only differences in gravitational potential energy matter for most physical purposes, and the choice of zero point is arbitrary. Given that there is no reasonable criterion for preferring one particular finite &quot;r&quot; over another, there seem to be only two reasonable choices for the distance at which becomes zero: formula_34 and formula_35. The choice of formula_36 at infinity may seem peculiar, and the consequence that gravitational energy is always negative may seem counterintuitive, but this choice allows gravitational potential energy values to be finite, albeit negative.

The singularity at formula_34 in the formula for gravitational potential energy means that the only other apparently reasonable alternative choice of convention, with formula_36 for formula_34, would result in potential energy being positive, but infinitely large for all nonzero values of , and would make calculations involving sums or differences of potential energies beyond what is possible with the real number system. Since physicists abhor infinities in their calculations, and is always non-zero in practice, the choice of formula_36 at infinity is by far the more preferable choice, even if the idea of negative energy in a gravity well appears to be peculiar at first.

The negative value for gravitational energy also has deeper implications that make it seem more reasonable in cosmological calculations where the total energy of the universe can meaningfully be considered; see inflation theory for more on this.

=== Uses ===

Gravitational potential energy has a number of practical uses, notably the generation of pumped-storage hydroelectricity. For example, in Dinorwig, Wales, there are two lakes, one at a higher elevation than the other. At times when surplus electricity is not required (and so is comparatively cheap), water is pumped up to the higher lake, thus converting the electrical energy (running the pump) to gravitational potential energy. At times of peak demand for electricity, the water flows back down through electrical generator turbines, converting the potential energy into kinetic energy and then back into electricity. The process is not completely efficient and some of the original energy from the surplus electricity is in fact lost to friction.

Gravitational potential energy is also used to power clocks in which falling weights operate the mechanism. It is also used by counterweights for lifting up an elevator, crane, or sash window.
Roller coasters are an entertaining way to utilize potential energy – chains are used to move a car up an incline (building up gravitational potential energy), to then have that energy converted into kinetic energy as it falls.

Another practical use is utilizing gravitational potential energy to descend (perhaps coast) downhill in transportation such as the descent of an automobile, truck, railroad train, bicycle, airplane, or fluid in a pipeline. In some cases the kinetic energy obtained from the potential energy of descent may be used to start ascending the next grade such as what happens when a road is undulating and has frequent dips. The commercialization of stored energy (in the form of rail cars raised to higher elevations) that is then converted to electrical energy when needed by an electrical grid, is being undertaken in the United States in a system called Advanced Rail Energy Storage (ARES).

== Chemical potential energy ==

Chemical potential energy is a form of potential energy related to the structural arrangement of atoms or molecules. This arrangement may be the result of chemical bonds within a molecule or otherwise. Chemical energy of a chemical substance can be transformed to other forms of energy by a chemical reaction. As an example, when a fuel is burned the chemical energy is converted to heat, same is the case with digestion of food metabolized in a biological organism. Green plants transform solar energy to chemical energy through the process known as photosynthesis, and electrical energy can be converted to chemical energy through electrochemical reactions.

The similar term chemical potential is used to indicate the potential of a substance to undergo a change of configuration, be it in the form of a chemical reaction, spatial transport, particle exchange with a reservoir, etc.

== Electric potential energy ==

An object can have potential energy by virtue of its electric charge and several forces related to their presence. There are two main types of this kind of potential energy: electrostatic potential energy, electrodynamic potential energy (also sometimes called magnetic potential energy).

=== Electrostatic potential energy ===
Electrostatic potential energy between two bodies in space is obtained from the force exerted by a charge &quot;Q&quot; on another charge &quot;q&quot; which is given by
formula_41
where formula_19 is a vector of length 1 pointing from &quot;Q&quot; to &quot;q&quot; and &quot;ε&quot;0 is the vacuum permittivity.

If the electric charge of an object can be assumed to be at rest, then it has potential energy due to its position relative to other charged objects. The electrostatic potential energy is the energy of an electrically charged particle (at rest) in an electric field. It is defined as the work that must be done to move it from an infinite distance away to its present location, adjusted for non-electrical forces on the object. This energy will generally be non-zero if there is another electrically charged object nearby.

The work &quot;W&quot; required to move &quot;q&quot; from &quot;A&quot; to any point &quot;B&quot; in the electrostatic force field is given by
formula_43
typically given in J for Joules. A related quantity called &quot;electric potential&quot; (commonly denoted with a &quot;V&quot; for voltage) is equal to the electric potential energy per unit charge.

=== Magnetic potential energy ===
The energy of a magnetic moment formula_44 in an externally produced magnetic B-field has potential energy
formula_45

The magnetization in a field is
formula_46
where the integral can be over all space or, equivalently, where is nonzero.
Magnetic potential energy is the form of energy related not only to the distance between magnetic materials, but also to the orientation, or alignment, of those materials within the field. For example, the needle of a compass has the lowest magnetic potential energy when it is aligned with the north and south poles of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. If the needle is moved by an outside force, torque is exerted on the magnetic dipole of the needle by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, causing it to move back into alignment. The magnetic potential energy of the needle is highest when its field is in the same direction as the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Two magnets will have potential energy in relation to each other and the distance between them, but this also depends on their orientation. If the opposite poles are held apart, the potential energy will be higher the further they are apart and lower the closer they are. Conversely, like poles will have the highest potential energy when forced together, and the lowest when they spring apart.

== Nuclear potential energy ==

Nuclear potential energy is the potential energy of the particles inside an atomic nucleus. The nuclear particles are bound together by the strong nuclear force. Their rest mass provides the potential energy for certain kinds of radioactive decay, such as beta decay.

Nuclear particles like protons and neutrons are not destroyed in fission and fusion processes, but collections of them can have less mass than if they were individually free, in which case this mass difference can be liberated as heat and radiation in nuclear reactions. The process of hydrogen fusion occurring in the Sun is an example of this form of energy release — 600 million tonnes of hydrogen nuclei are fused into helium nuclei, with a loss of about 4 million tonnes of mass per second. This energy, now in the form of kinetic energy and gamma rays, keeps the solar core hot even as electromagnetic radiation carries electromagnetic energy into space.

== Forces and potential energy ==
Potential energy is closely linked with forces. If the work done by a force on a body that moves from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; does not depend on the path between these points, then the work of this force measured from &quot;A&quot; assigns a scalar value to every other point in space and defines a scalar potential field. In this case, the force can be defined as the negative of the vector gradient of the potential field.

For example, gravity is a conservative force. The associated potential is the gravitational potential, often denoted by formula_47 or formula_48, corresponding to the energy per unit mass as a function of position. The gravitational potential energy of two particles of mass &quot;M&quot; and &quot;m&quot; separated by a distance &quot;r&quot; is
formula_49
The gravitational potential (specific energy) of the two bodies is
formula_50
where formula_51 is the reduced mass.

The work done against gravity by moving an infinitesimal mass from point A with formula_52 to point B with formula_53 is formula_54 and the work done going back the other way is formula_55 so that the total work done in moving from A to B and returning to A is
formula_56
If the potential is redefined at A to be formula_57 and the potential at B to be formula_58, where formula_59 is a constant (i.e. formula_59 can be any number, positive or negative, but it must be the same at A as it is at B) then the work done going from A to B is
formula_61
as before.

In practical terms, this means that one can set the zero of formula_62 and formula_47 anywhere one likes. One may set it to be zero at the surface of the Earth, or may find it more convenient to set zero at infinity (as in the expressions given earlier in this section).
A conservative force can be expressed in the language of differential geometry as a closed form. As Euclidean space is contractible, its de Rham cohomology vanishes, so every closed form is also an exact form, and can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar field. This gives a mathematical justification of the fact that all conservative forces are gradients of a potential field.

<text>A pyramid () is a structure whose visible surfaces are triangular in broad outline and converge toward the top, making the appearance roughly a pyramid in the geometric sense. The base of a pyramid can be of any polygon shape, such as triangular or quadrilateral, and its lines either filled or stepped.

A pyramid has the majority of its mass closer to the ground with less mass towards the pyramidion at the apex. This is due to the gradual decrease in the cross-sectional area along the vertical axis with increasing elevation. This offers a weight distribution that allowed early civilizations to create monumental structures.Civilizations in many parts of the world have built pyramids. The largest pyramid by volume is the Mesoamerican Great Pyramid of Cholula, in the Mexican state of Puebla. For millennia, the largest structures on Earth were pyramids—first the Red Pyramid in the Dashur Necropolis and then the Great Pyramid of Khufu, both in Egypt—the latter is the only extant example of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

==Ancient monuments==
=== West Asia ===

==== Mesopotamia ====


The Mesopotamians built the earliest pyramidal structures, called &quot;ziggurats&quot;. In ancient times, these were brightly painted in gold/bronze. They were constructed of sun-dried mud-brick, and little remains of them. Ziggurats were built by the Sumerians, Babylonians, Elamites, Akkadians, and Assyrians. Each ziggurat was part of a temple complex that included other buildings. The ziggurat&#x27;s precursors were raised platforms that date from the Ubaid period of the fourth millennium BC.

The earliest ziggurats began near the end of the Early Dynastic Period. The original pyramidal structure, the anu ziggurat, dates to around 4000 BC. The White Temple was built on top of it circa 3500 BC. 
Built in receding tiers upon a rectangular, oval, or square platform, the ziggurat was a pyramidal structure with a flat top. Sun-baked bricks made up the core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the outside. The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had astrological significance. Kings sometimes had their names engraved on them. The number of tiers ranged from two to seven. It is assumed that they had shrines at the top, but no archaeological evidence supports this and the only textual evidence is from Herodotus. Access to the shrine would have been by a series of ramps on one side of the ziggurat or by a spiral ramp from base to summit.

=== Africa ===
==== Egypt ====
The most famous African pyramids are in Egypt — huge structures built of bricks or stones, primarily limestone, some of which are among the world&#x27;s largest constructions. They are shaped in reference to the sun&#x27;s rays. Most had a smoothed white limestone surface. Many of the facing stones have fallen or were removed and used for construction in Cairo. The capstone was usually made of limestone, granite or basalt and some were plated with electrum.

Ancient Egyptians built pyramids from 2700 BC until around 1700 BC. The first pyramid was erected during the Third Dynasty by the Pharaoh Djoser and his architect Imhotep. This step pyramid consisted of six stacked mastabas. Early kings such as Snefru built pyramids, with subsequent kings adding to the number until the end of the Middle Kingdom. The age of the pyramids reached its zenith at Giza in 2575–2150 BC. The last king to build royal pyramids was Ahmose, with later kings hiding their tombs in the hills, such as those in the Valley of the Kings in Luxor&#x27;s West Bank. In Medinat Habu and Deir el-Medina, smaller pyramids were built by individuals. Smaller pyramids with steeper sides were built by the Nubians who ruled Egypt in the Late Period.

The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest in Egypt and one of the largest in the world. At it was the tallest structure in the world until the Lincoln Cathedral was finished in 1311 AD. Its base covers an area of around . The Great Pyramid is the only extant one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

Ancient Egyptian pyramids were, in most cases, placed west of the river Nile because the divine pharaoh&#x27;s soul was meant to join with the sun during its descent before continuing with the sun in its eternal round. As of 2008, some 135 pyramids had been discovered in Egypt, most located near Cairo.

==== Sudan ====

While African pyramids are commonly associated with Egypt, Sudan has 220 extant pyramids, the most in the world. Nubian pyramids were constructed (roughly 240 of them) at three sites in Sudan to serve as tombs for the kings and queens of Napata and Meroë. The pyramids of Kush, also known as Nubian Pyramids, have different characteristics than those of Egypt. The Nubian pyramids had steeper sides than the Egyptian ones. Pyramids were built in Sudan as late as 200 AD.

==== Sahel ====
The Tomb of Askia, in Gao, Mali, is believed to be the burial place of Askia Mohammad I, one of the Songhai Empire&#x27;s most prolific emperors. It was built at the end of the fifteenth century and is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

UNESCO describes the tomb as an example of the monumental mud-building traditions of the West African Sahel. The complex includes the pyramidal tomb, two mosques, a cemetery and an assembly ground. At 17 metres (56 ft) in height it is the largest pre-colonial architectural monument in Gao. It is a notable example of the Sudano-Sahelian architectural style that later spread throughout the region.

==== Nigeria ====

One of the unique structures of Igbo culture was the Nsude pyramids, in the Nigerian town of Nsude, northern Igboland. Ten pyramidal structures were built of clay/mud. The first base section was in circumference and in height. The next stack was in circumference. Circular stacks continued to the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala, who was believed to reside there. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god&#x27;s residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, over time periodic reconstruction has been required.

=== Europe ===

==== Greece ====
Pausanias (2nd century AD) mentions two buildings resembling pyramids, one, 19 kilometres (12 mi) southwest of a still standing structure at Hellenikon, a common tomb for soldiers who died in a legendary struggle for the throne of Argos and another that he was told was the tomb of Argives killed in a battle around 669/8 BC. Neither survives and no evidence indicates that they resembled Egyptian pyramids.

At least two surviving pyramid-like structures are available to study, one at Hellenikon and the other at Ligourio/Ligurio, a village near the ancient theatre Epidaurus. These buildings have inwardly sloping walls, but bear no other resemblance to Egyptian pyramids. They had large central rooms (unlike Egyptian pyramids) and the Hellenikon structure is rectangular rather than square, which means that the sides could not have met at a point. The stone used to build these structures was limestone quarried locally and was cut to fit, not into freestanding blocks like the Great Pyramid of Giza.

These structures were dated from pot shards excavated from the floor and grounds. The latest estimates are around the 5th and 4th centuries. Normally this technique is used for dating pottery, but researchers used it to try to date stone flakes from the structure walls. This launched debate about whether or not these structures are actually older than Egypt, part of the Black Athena controversy.

Lefkowitz criticised this research, suggesting that some of the research was done not to determine the reliability of the dating method, as was suggested, but to back up a claim and to make points about pyramids and Greek civilization. She claimed that not only were the results imprecise, but that other structures mentioned in the research are not in fact pyramids, e.g. a tomb alleged to be the tomb of Amphion and Zethus near Thebes, a structure at Stylidha (Thessaly) which is a long wall, etc. She pushed the possibility that the stones that were dated might have been recycled from earlier constructions. She claimed that earlier research from the 1930s, confirmed in the 1980s by Fracchia, was ignored.

Liritzis responded that Lefkowitz failed to understand and misinterpreted the methodology.

==== Spain ====

The Pyramids of Güímar refer to six rectangular pyramid-shaped, terraced structures, built from lava without mortar. They are located in the district of Chacona, part of the town of Güímar on the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The structures were dated to the 19th century and their function explained as a byproduct of contemporary agricultural techniques.

Autochthonous Guanche traditions as well as surviving images indicate that similar structures (also known as, &quot;Morras&quot;, &quot;Majanos&quot;, &quot;Molleros&quot;, or &quot;Paredones&quot;) were built in many locations on the island. However, over time they were dismantled and used as building material. Güímar hostred nine pyramids, only six of which survive.

==== Roman Empire ====
The 27-metre-high Pyramid of Cestius was built by the end of the 1st century BC and survives close to the Porta San Paolo. Another, named &quot;Meta Romuli&quot;, stood in the &quot;Ager Vaticanus&quot; (today&#x27;s Borgo), but was destroyed at the end of the 15th century.

==== Medieval Europe ====
Pyramids were occasionally used in Christian architecture during the feudal era, e.g. as the tower of Oviedo&#x27;s Gothic Cathedral of San Salvador.

=== Americas ===
==== Peru ====
Andean cultures used pyramids in various architectural structures such as the ones in Caral, Túcume and Chavín de Huantar, constructed around the same time as early Egyptian pyramids.

==== Mesoamerica ====
Several Mesoamerican cultures built pyramid-shaped structures. Mesoamerican pyramids were usually stepped, with temples on top, more similar to the Mesopotamian ziggurat than the Egyptian pyramid.

The largest by volume is the Great Pyramid of Cholula, in the Mexican state of Puebla. Constructed from the 3rd century BC to the 9th century AD, this pyramid is the world&#x27;s largest monument, and is still not fully excavated. The third largest pyramid in the world, the Pyramid of the Sun, at Teotihuacan, is also located in Mexico. An unusual pyramid with a circular plan survives at the site of Cuicuilco, now inside Mexico City and mostly covered with lava from an eruption of the Xitle Volcano in the 1st century BC. Several circular stepped pyramids called Guachimontones survive in Teuchitlán, Jalisco.

Pyramids in Mexico were often used for human sacrifice. Harner stated that for the dedication of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, &quot;one source states 20,000, another 72,344, and several give 80,400&quot; as the number of humans sacrificed.

==== United States ====
Many pre-Columbian Native American societies of ancient North America built large pyramidal earth structures known as platform mounds. Among the largest and best-known of these structures is Monks Mound at the site of Cahokia in what became Illinois, completed around 1100 AD. It has a base larger than that of the Great Pyramid. Many mounds underwent repeated episodes of expansion. They are believed to have played a central role in the mound-building peoples&#x27; religious life. Documented uses include semi-public chief&#x27;s house platforms, public temple platforms, mortuary platforms, charnel house platforms, earth lodge/town house platforms, residence platforms, square ground and rotunda platforms, and dance platforms. Cultures that built substructure mounds include the Troyville culture, Coles Creek culture, Plaquemine culture and Mississippian cultures.

=== Asia ===


Many square flat-topped mound tombs in China. The first emperor Qin Shi Huang (, who unified the seven pre-imperial kingdoms) was buried under a large mound outside modern-day Xi&#x27;an. In the following centuries about a dozen more Han dynasty royal persons were also buried under flat-topped pyramidal earthworks.

==== India ====
Numerous giant, granite, temple pyramids were built in South India during the Chola Empire, many of which remain in use. Examples include Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, Brihadisvara Temple at Gangaikonda Cholapuram, and the Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram. However, the largest temple (area) is the Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam, Tamil Nadu. The Thanjavur temple was built by Raja Raja Chola in the 11th century. The Brihadisvara Temple was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987; the Temple of Gangaikondacholapuram and the Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram were added in 2004.
==== Indonesia ====
Austronesian megalithic culture in Indonesia featured earth and stone step pyramid structures called &quot;punden berundak.&quot; These were discovered in Pangguyangan near Cisolok and in Cipari near Kuningan. The stone pyramids were based on beliefs that mountains and high places were the abode for the spirit of the ancestors.

The step pyramid is the basic design of the 8th century Borobudur Buddhist monument in Central Java. However later Java temples were influenced by Indian Hindu architecture, as exemplified by the spires of Prambanan temple. In the 15th century, during late Majapahit period, Java saw the revival of indigenous Austronesian elements as displayed by Sukuh temple that somewhat resemble Mesoamerican pyramids, and also stepped pyramids of Mount Penanggungan.

==== East Asia, Southeast Asia and Central Asia ====

In east Asia, Buddhist stupas were usually represented as tall pagodas. However, some pyramidal stupas survive. One theory is that these pyramids were inspired by the Borobudur monument through Sumatran and Javanese monks. A similar Buddhist monument survives in Vrang, Tajikistan. At least nine Buddhist step pyramids survive, 4 from former Gyeongsang Province of Korea, 3 from Japan, 1 from Indonesia (Borobudur) and 1 from Tajikistan.

=== Oceania ===
Several pyramids were erected throughout the Pacific islands, such as Puʻukoholā Heiau in Hawaii, the Pulemelei Mound in Samoa, and Nan Madol in Pohnpei.

=== Modern mausoleums ===

With the Egyptian Revival movement in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, pyramids became more common in funerary architecture. The tomb of Quintino Sella, outside the monumental cemetery of Oropa, is pyramid-shaped. This style was popular with tycoons in the US. The Schoenhofen Pyramid Mausoleum (1889) in Chicago and Hunt&#x27;s Tomb (1930) in Phoenix, Arizona are notable examples. Some people build pyramid tombs for themselves. Nicolas Cage bought a pyramid tomb for himself in a famed New Orleans graveyard.

<doc id="23705" wikidata="Q193203" url="?curid=23705" title="Predestination">
<text>Predestination, in theology, is the doctrine that all events have been willed by God, usually with reference to the eventual fate of the individual soul. Explanations of predestination often seek to address the paradox of free will, whereby God&#x27;s omniscience seems incompatible with human free will. In this usage, predestination can be regarded as a form of religious determinism; and usually predeterminism, also known as theological determinism.

==History==
=== Pre-Christian period ===
Some have argued that the Book of Enoch contains a deterministic worldview that is combined with dualism. The book of Jubilees seems to harmonize or mix together a doctrine of free will and determinism.

Ben Sira affirms free will, where God allows a choice of bad or good before the human and thus they can choose which one to follow.

=== New Testament period ===
There is some disagreement among scholars regarding the views on predestination of first-century AD Judaism, out of which Christianity came. Josephus wrote during the first century that the three main Jewish sects differed on this question. He argued that the Essenes and Pharisees argued that God&#x27;s providence orders all human events, but the Pharisees still maintained that people are able to choose between right and wrong. He wrote that the Sadducees did not have a doctrine of providence.

Biblical scholar N. T. Wright argues that Josephus&#x27;s portrayal of these groups is incorrect, and that the Jewish debates referenced by Josephus should be seen as having to do with God&#x27;s work to liberate Israel rather than philosophical questions about predestination. Wright asserts that Essenes were content to wait for God to liberate Israel while Pharisees believed Jews needed to act in cooperation with God. John Barclay responded that Josephus&#x27;s description was an over-simplification and there were likely to be complex differences between these groups which may have been similar to those described by Josephus. Francis Watson has also argued on the basis of 4 Ezra, a document dated to the first century AD, that Jewish beliefs in predestination are primarily concerned with God&#x27;s choice to save some individual Jews.

However some in the Qumran community possibly believed in predestination, for example 1QS states that &quot;God has caused (his chosen ones) to inherit the lot of the Holy Ones&quot;.

In the New Testament, Romans 8–11 presents a statement on predestination. In Romans 8:28–30, Paul writes,
Biblical scholars have interpreted this passage in several ways. Many say this only has to do with service, and is not about salvation. The Catholic biblical commentator Brendan Byrne wrote that the predestination mentioned in this passage should be interpreted as applied to the Christian community corporately rather than individuals. Another Catholic commentator, Joseph Fitzmyer, wrote that this passage teaches that God has predestined the salvation of all humans. Douglas Moo, a Protestant biblical interpreter, reads the passage as teaching that God has predestined a certain set of people to salvation, and predestined the remainder of humanity to reprobation (damnation). Similarly, Wright&#x27;s interpretation is that in this passage Paul teaches that God will save those whom he has chosen, but Wright also emphasizes that Paul does not intend to suggest that God has eliminated human free will or responsibility. Instead, Wright asserts, Paul is saying that God&#x27;s will works through that of humans to accomplish salvation.

=== Patristic period ===
==== Pre-Nicene period ====
Origen, writing in the third century, taught that God&#x27;s providence extends to every individual. He believed God&#x27;s predestination was based on God&#x27;s foreknowledge of every individual&#x27;s merits, whether in their current life or a previous life.

Gill and Gregg Alisson argued that Clement of Rome held to a predestinarian view of salvation.

Some verses in the Odes of Solomon, which was made by an Essene convert into Christianity, might possibly suggest a predestinarian worldview, where God chooses who are saved and go into heaven, although there is controversy about what it teaches. The Odes of Solomon talks about God &quot;imprinting a seal on the face of the elect before they existed&quot;. The Thomasines saw themselves as children of the light, but the ones who were not part of the elect community were sons of darkness. The Thomasines thus had a belief in a type of election or predestination, they saw themselves as elect because they were born from the light.

Valentinus believed in a form of predestination, in his view humans are born into one of three natures, depending on which elements prevail in the person. In the views of Valentinus, a person born with a bad nature can never be saved because they are too inclined into evil, some people have a nature which is a mixture of good and evil, thus they can choose salvation, and others have a good nature, who will be saved, because they will be inclined into good.

Irenaeus also attacked the doctrine of predestination set out by Valentinus, arguing that it is unfair. For Irenaeus, humans were free to choose salvation or not.

Justin Martyr attacked predestinarian views held by some Greek philosophers.

==== Post-Nicene period ====

Later in the fourth and fifth centuries, Augustine of Hippo (354–430) also taught that God orders all things while preserving human freedom. Prior to 396, Augustine believed that predestination was based on God&#x27;s foreknowledge of whether individuals would believe, that God&#x27;s grace was &quot;a reward for human assent&quot;. Later, in response to Pelagius, Augustine said that the sin of pride consists in assuming that &quot;we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us&quot;, and argued that it is God&#x27;s grace that causes the individual act of faith. Scholars are divided over whether Augustine&#x27;s teaching implies double predestination, or the belief that God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation. Catholic scholars tend to deny that he held such a view while some Protestants and secular scholars affirm that Augustine did believe in double predestination.

Augustine&#x27;s position raised objections. Julian of Eclanum expressed the view that Augustine was bringing Manichean thoughts into the church. For Vincent of Lérins, this was a disturbing innovation. This new tension eventually became obvious with the confrontation between Augustine and Pelagius culminating in condemnation of Pelagianism (as interpreted by Augustine) at the Council of Ephesus in 431. Pelagius denied Augustine&#x27;s view of predestination in order to affirm that salvation is achieved by an act of free will.

The Council of Arles in the late fifth century condemned the position &quot;that some have been condemned to death, others have been predestined to life&quot;, though this may seem to follow from Augustine&#x27;s teaching. The Second Council of Orange in 529 also condemned the position that &quot;some have been truly predestined to evil by divine power&quot;.

In the eighth century, John of Damascus emphasized the freedom of the human will in his doctrine of predestination, and argued that acts arising from peoples&#x27; wills are not part of God&#x27;s providence at all. Damascene teaches that people&#x27;s good actions are done in cooperation with God, but are not caused by him.

Prosper of Aquitaine (390 – c. 455 AD) defended Augustine&#x27;s view of predestination against semi-Pelagians. Marius Mercator, who was a pupil of Augustine, wrote five books against Pelagianism and one book about predestination. Fulgentius of Ruspe and Caesarius of Arles rejected the view that God gives free choice to believe and instead believed in predestination.

Cassian believed that despite predestination being a work that God does, God only decides to predestinate based on how human beings will respond.

Augustine stated, &quot;And thus Christ&#x27;s Church has never failed to hold the faith of this predestination, which is now being defended with new solicitude against these modern heretics.&quot;
=== Middle Ages ===
Gottschalk of Orbais, a ninth-century Saxon monk, argued that God predestines some people to hell as well as predestining some to heaven, a view known as double predestination. He was condemned by several synods, but his views remained popular. Irish theologian John Scotus Eriugena wrote a refutation of Gottschalk. Eriugena abandoned Augustine&#x27;s teaching on predestination. He wrote that God&#x27;s predestination should be equated with his foreknowledge of people&#x27;s choices.

In the thirteenth century, Thomas Aquinas taught that God predestines certain people to the beatific vision based solely on his own goodness rather than that of creatures. Aquinas also believed that people are free in their choices, fully cause their own sin, and are solely responsible for it. According to Aquinas, there are several ways in which God wills actions. He directly wills the good, indirectly wills evil consequences of good things, and only permits evil. Aquinas held that in permitting evil, God does not will it to be done or not to be done.

In the thirteenth century, William of Ockham taught that God does not cause human choices and equated predestination with divine foreknowledge. Though Ockham taught that God predestines based on people&#x27;s foreseen works, he maintained that God&#x27;s will was not constrained to do this. Medieval theologians who believed in predestination include: Ratramnus (died 868), Thomas Bradwardine (1300–1349), Gregory of Rimini (1300–1358), John Wycliffe (1320s–1384), Johann Ruchrat von Wesel (died 1481), Girolamo Savonarola (1452–1498) and Johannes von Staupitz (1460–1524).

The medieval Cathars denied the free will of humans.

=== Reformation ===
John Calvin rejected the idea that God permits rather than actively decrees the damnation of sinners, as well as other evil. Calvin did not believe God to be guilty of sin, but rather he considered God inflicting sin upon his creations to be an unfathomable mystery. Though he maintained God&#x27;s predestination applies to damnation as well as salvation, he taught that the damnation of the damned is caused by their sin, but that the salvation of the saved is solely caused by God. Other Protestant Reformers, including Huldrych Zwingli, also held double predestinarian views.

==Views of Christian branches==

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
The Eastern Orthodox view was summarized by Bishop Theophan the Recluse in response to the question, &quot;What is the relationship between the Divine provision and our free will?&quot;
=== Roman Catholicism ===
Roman Catholicism teaches the doctrine of predestination. The Catechism of the Catholic Church says, &quot;To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore He establishes His eternal plan of &#x27;predestination&#x27;, He includes in it each person&#x27;s free response to his grace.&quot; Therefore, in the Roman Catholic conception of predestination, free will is not denied. However, Roman Catholic theology has discouraged beliefs that it is possible for anyone to know or predict anything about the operation and outcomes of predestination, and therefore it normally plays a very small role in Roman Catholic thinking.

The heretical seventeenth and eighteenth centuries sect within Roman Catholicism known as Jansenism preached the doctrine of double predestination, although Jansenism claimed that even members of the saved elect could lose their salvation by doing sinful, un-repented deeds, as implied in Ezekiel 18:21–28 in the Old Testament of the Bible. According to the Roman Catholic Church, God does not will anyone to mortally sin and so to deserve punishment in hell.

Pope John Paul II wrote:
Augustine of Hippo laid the foundation for much of the later Roman Catholic teaching on predestination. His teachings on grace and free will were largely adopted by the Second Council of Orange (529), whose decrees were directed against the Semipelagians. Augustine wrote,
Augustine also teaches that people have free will. For example, in &quot;On Grace and Free Will&quot;, (see especially chapters II–IV) Augustine states that &quot;He [God] has revealed to us, through His Holy Scriptures, that there is in man a free choice of will,&quot; and that &quot;God&#x27;s precepts themselves would be of no use to a man unless he had free choice of will, so that by performing them he might obtain the promised rewards.&quot; (chap. II)

Thomas Aquinas&#x27; views concerning predestination are largely in agreement with Augustine and can be summarized by many of his writings in his &quot;Summa Theologiæ&quot;:
=== Protestantism ===

==== Comparison ====
This table summarizes the classical views of three different Protestant beliefs.


==== Lutheranism ====
Lutherans historically hold to unconditional election to salvation. However, some do not believe that there are certain people that are predestined to salvation, but salvation is predestined for those who seek God. Lutherans believe Christians should be assured that they are among the predestined. However, they disagree with those who make predestination the source of salvation rather than Christ&#x27;s suffering, death, and resurrection. Unlike some Calvinists, Lutherans do not believe in a predestination to damnation. Instead, Lutherans teach eternal damnation is a result of the unbeliever&#x27;s rejection of the forgiveness of sins and unbelief.

Martin Luther&#x27;s attitude towards predestination is set out in his &quot;On the Bondage of the Will&quot;, published in 1525. This publication by Luther was in response to the published treatise by Desiderius Erasmus in 1524 known as &quot;On Free Will&quot;.

==== Calvinism ====

The Belgic Confession of 1561 affirmed that God &quot;delivers and preserves&quot; from perdition &quot;all whom he, in his eternal and unchangeable council, of mere goodness hath elected in Christ Jesus our Lord, without respect to their works&quot; (Article XVI). Calvinists believe that God picked those whom he will save and bring with him to Heaven before the world was created. They also believe that those people God does not save will go to Hell. John Calvin thought people who were saved could never lose their salvation and the &quot;elect&quot; (those God saved) would know they were saved because of their actions.

In this common, loose sense of the term, to affirm or to deny predestination has particular reference to the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional election. In the Calvinist interpretation of the Bible, this doctrine normally has only pastoral value related to the assurance of salvation and the absolution of salvation by grace alone. However, the philosophical implications of the doctrine of election and predestination are sometimes discussed beyond these systematic bounds. Under the topic of the doctrine of God (theology proper), the predestinating decision of God cannot be contingent upon anything outside of himself, because all other things are dependent upon him for existence and meaning. Under the topic of the doctrines of salvation (soteriology), the predestinating decision of God is made from God&#x27;s knowledge of his own will (Romans 9:15), and is therefore not contingent upon human decisions (rather, free human decisions are outworkings of the decision of God, which sets the total reality within which those decisions are made in exhaustive detail: that is, nothing left to chance). Calvinists do not pretend to understand how this works; but they are insistent that the Scriptures teach both the sovereign control of God and the responsibility and freedom of human decisions.

Calvinist groups use the term Hyper-Calvinism to describe Calvinistic systems that assert without qualification that God&#x27;s intention to destroy some is equal to his intention to save others. Some forms of Hyper-Calvinism have racial implications, as when Dutch Calvinist theologian Franciscus Gomarus argued that Jews, because of their refusal to worship Jesus Christ, were members of the non-elect, as also argued by John Calvin himself, based on I John 2:22–23 in The New Testament of the Bible. Some Dutch settlers in South Africa argued that black people were sons of Ham, whom Noah had cursed to be slaves, according to Genesis 9:18–19, or drew analogies between them and the Canaanites, suggesting a &quot;chosen people&quot; ideology similar to that espoused by proponents of the Jewish nation. This justified racial hierarchy on earth, as well as racial segregation of congregations, but did not exclude blacks from being part of the elect. Other Calvinists vigorously objected to these arguments (see Afrikaner Calvinism).

Expressed sympathetically, the Calvinist doctrine is that God has mercy or withholds it, with particular consciousness of who are to be the recipients of mercy in Christ. Therefore, the particular persons are chosen, out of the total number of human beings, who will be rescued from enslavement to sin and the fear of death, and from punishment due to sin, to dwell forever in his presence. Those who are being saved are assured through the gifts of faith, the sacraments, and communion with God through prayer and increase of good works, that their reconciliation with him through Christ is settled by the sovereign determination of God&#x27;s will. God also has particular consciousness of those who are passed over by his selection, who are without excuse for their rebellion against him, and will be judged for their sins.

Calvinists typically divide on the issue of predestination into infralapsarians (sometimes called &#x27;sublapsarians&#x27;) and supralapsarians. Infralapsarians interpret the biblical election of God to highlight his love (1 John 4:8; Ephesians 1:4b–5a) and chose his elect considering the situation after the Fall, while supralapsarians interpret biblical election to highlight God&#x27;s sovereignty (Romans 9:16) and that the Fall was ordained by God&#x27;s decree of election. In infralapsarianism, election is God&#x27;s response to the Fall, while in supralapsarianism the Fall is part of God&#x27;s plan for election. In spite of the division, many Calvinist theologians would consider the debate surrounding the infra- and supralapsarian positions one in which scant Scriptural evidence can be mustered in either direction, and that, at any rate, has little effect on the overall doctrine.

Some Calvinists decline to describe the eternal decree of God in terms of a sequence of events or thoughts, and many caution against the simplifications involved in describing any action of God in speculative terms. Most make distinctions between the positive manner in which God chooses some to be recipients of grace, and the manner in which grace is consciously withheld so that some are destined for everlasting punishments.

Debate concerning predestination according to the common usage concerns the destiny of the damned: whether God is just if that destiny is settled prior to the existence of any actual volition of the individual, and whether the individual is in any meaningful sense responsible for his destiny if it is settled by the eternal action of God.

==== Arminianism ====
At the beginning of the 17th century, the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius formulated Arminianism and disagreed with Calvin in particular on election and predestination. Arminianism is defined by God&#x27;s limited mode of providence. This mode of providence affirms the compatibility between human free will and divine foreknowledge, but its incompatibility with theological determinism. Thus predestination in Arminianism is based on divine foreknowledge, unlike in Calvinism. It is therefore a predestination by foreknowledge.

From this perspective, comes the notion of a conditional election on the one who wills to have faith in God for salvation. This means that God does not predetermine, but instead infallibly knows who will believe and perseveringly be saved. Although God knows from the beginning of the world who will go where, the choice is still with the individual.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) rejects the doctrine of predestination, but does believe in foreordination. Foreordination, an important doctrine of the LDS Church, teaches that during the pre-mortal existence, God selected (&quot;foreordained&quot;) particular people to fulfill certain missions (&quot;callings&quot;) during their mortal lives. For example, prophets were foreordained to be the Lord&#x27;s servants (see Jeremiah 1:5), all who receive the priesthood were foreordained to that calling, and Jesus was foreordained to enact the atonement. However, all such persons foreordained retain their agency in mortality to fulfill that foreordination or not. 

The LDS Church teaches the doctrine of moral agency, the ability to choose and act for oneself, and decide whether to accept Christ&#x27;s atonement.

==Types of predestination==
===Conditional election===
Conditional election is the belief that God chooses for eternal salvation those whom he foresees will have faith in Christ. This belief emphasizes the importance of a person&#x27;s free will. The counter-view is known as unconditional election, and is the belief that God chooses whomever he will, based solely on his purposes and apart from an individual&#x27;s free will. It has long been an issue in Calvinist–Arminian debate. An alternative viewpoint is Corporate election, which distinguishes God&#x27;s election and predestination for corporate entities such as the community &quot;in Christ,&quot; and individuals who can benefit from that community&#x27;s election and predestination so long as they continue belonging to that community.

===Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism===
Infralapsarianism (also called sublapsarianism) holds that predestination logically coincides with the preordination of Man&#x27;s fall into sin. That is, God predestined sinful men for salvation. Therefore, according to this view, God is the ultimate cause, but not the proximate source or &quot;author&quot; of sin. Infralapsarians often emphasize a difference between God&#x27;s decree (which is inviolable and inscrutable), and his revealed will (against which man is disobedient). Proponents also typically emphasize the grace and mercy of God toward all men, although teaching also that only some are predestined for salvation.

In common English parlance, the doctrine of predestination often has particular reference to the doctrines of Calvinism. The version of predestination espoused by John Calvin, after whom Calvinism is named, is sometimes referred to as &quot;double predestination&quot; because in it God predestines some people for salvation (i.e. unconditional election) and some for condemnation (i.e. Reprobation) which results by allowing the individual&#x27;s own sins to condemn them. Calvin himself defines predestination as &quot;the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. Not all are created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestined to life or to death.&quot;

On the spectrum of beliefs concerning predestination, Calvinism is the strongest form among Christians. It teaches that God&#x27;s predestining decision is based on the knowledge of his own will rather than foreknowledge, concerning every particular person and event; and, God continually acts with entire freedom, in order to bring about his will in completeness, but in such a way that the freedom of the creature is not violated, &quot;but rather, established&quot;.

Calvinists who hold the infralapsarian view of predestination usually prefer that term to &quot;sublapsarianism,&quot; perhaps with the intent of blocking the inference that they believe predestination is on the basis of foreknowledge (&quot;sublapsarian&quot; meaning, assuming the fall into sin). The different terminology has the benefit of distinguishing the Calvinist double predestination version of infralapsarianism from Lutheranism&#x27;s view that predestination is a mystery, which forbids the unprofitable intrusion of prying minds since God only reveals partial knowledge to the human race.

Supralapsarianism is the doctrine that God&#x27;s decree of predestination for salvation and reprobation logically precedes his preordination of the human race&#x27;s fall into sin. That is, God decided to save, and to damn; he then determined the means by which that would be made possible. It is a matter of controversy whether or not Calvin himself held this view, but most scholars link him with the infralapsarian position. It is known, however, that Calvin&#x27;s successor in Geneva, Theodore Beza, held to the supralapsarian view.

===Double predestination===

Double predestination, or the double decree, is the doctrine that God actively reprobates, or decrees damnation of some, as well as salvation for those whom he has elected. During the Protestant Reformation John Calvin held this double predestinarian view: &quot;By predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestinated to life or to death.&quot;

Gottschalk of Orbais taught double predestination explicitly in the ninth century, and Gregory of Rimini in the fourteenth. Some trace this doctrine to statements made by Augustine in the early fifth century that on their own also seem to teach double predestination, but in the context of his other writings it is not clear whether he held this view. In &quot;The City of God,&quot; Augustine describes all of humanity as being predestinated for salvation (i.e., the city of God) or damnation (i.e., the earthly city of man); but Augustine also held that all human beings were born &quot;reprobate&quot; but &quot;need not necessarily remain&quot; in that state of reprobation.

=== Corporate election ===

Corporate election is a non-traditional Arminian view of election. In corporate election, God does not choose which individuals he will save prior to creation, but rather God chooses the church as a whole. Or put differently, God chooses a group of people he will save (members of the church), and individuals may work their way into (or out of) the said group. Another way the New Testament puts this is to say that God chose the church in Christ (Eph. 1:4). In other words, God chose from all eternity to save all those who would be found in Christ, by faith in God. This choosing is not primarily about salvation from eternal destruction either but is about God&#x27;s chosen agency in the world. Thus individuals have full freedom in terms of whether they become members of the church or not. Corporate election is thus consistent with the open view&#x27;s position on God&#x27;s omniscience, which states that God&#x27;s foreknowledge does not determine the outcomes of individual free will.

=== Middle knowledge ===
Middle knowledge is a concept that was developed by Jesuit theologian Luis de Molina, and exists under a doctrine called Molinism. It attempts to deal with the topic of predestination by reconciling God&#x27;s sovereign providence with the notion of libertarian free will. The concept of Middle Knowledge holds that God has a knowledge of true pre-volitional counterfactuals for all free creatures. That is, what any individual creature with a free will (e.g. a human) would do under any given circumstance. God&#x27;s knowledge of counterfactuals is reasoned to occur logically prior to his divine creative decree (that is, prior to creation), and after his knowledge of necessary truths. Thus, Middle Knowledge holds that before the world was created, God knew what every existing creature capable of libertarian freedom (e.g. every individual human) would freely choose to do in all possible circumstances. It then holds that based on this information, God elected from a number of these possible worlds, the world most consistent with his ultimate will, which is the actual world that we live in.

For example:
* if Free Creature A was to be placed in Circumstance B, God via his Middle Knowledge would know that Free Creature A will freely choose option Y over option Z.
* if Free Creature A was to be placed in Circumstance C, God via his Middle Knowledge would know that Free Creature A will freely choose option Z over option Y.

Based on this Middle Knowledge, God has the ability to actualise the world in which A is placed in a circumstance that he freely chooses to do what is consistent with Gods ultimate will. If God determined that the world most suited to his purposes is a world in which A would freely choose Y instead of Z, God can actualise a world in which Free Creature A finds himself in Circumstance B.

In this way, Middle Knowledge is thought of by its proponents to be consistent with any theological doctrines that assert God as having divine providence and man having a libertarian freedom (e.g. Calvinism, Catholicism, Lutheranism), and to offer a potential solution to the concerns that God&#x27;s providence somehow nullifies man from having true liberty in his choices.

<doc id="23706" wikidata="Q6453739" url="?curid=23706" title="Primitive notion">
<text>In mathematics, logic, philosophy, and formal systems, a primitive notion is a concept that is not defined in terms of previously-defined concepts. It is often motivated informally, usually by an appeal to intuition or taken to be self-evident. In an axiomatic theory, relations between primitive notions are restricted by axioms. Some authors refer to the latter as &quot;defining&quot; primitive notions by one or more axioms, but this can be misleading. Formal theories cannot dispense with primitive notions, under pain of infinite regress (per the regress problem).

For example, in contemporary geometry, &quot;point&quot;, &quot;line&quot;, and &quot;contains&quot; are some primitive notions.

==Details==
Alfred Tarski explained the role of primitive notions as follows:
:When we set out to construct a given discipline, we distinguish, first of all, a certain small group of expressions of this discipline that seem to us to be immediately understandable; the expressions in this group we call PRIMITIVE TERMS or UNDEFINED TERMS, and we employ them without explaining their meanings. At the same time we adopt the principle: not to employ any of the other expressions of the discipline under consideration, unless its meaning has first been determined with the help of primitive terms and of such expressions of the discipline whose meanings have been explained previously. The sentence which determines the meaning of a term in this way is called a DEFINITION...

An inevitable regress to primitive notions in the theory of knowledge was explained by Gilbert de B. Robinson:
:To a non-mathematician it often comes as a surprise that it is impossible to define explicitly all the terms which are used. This is not a superficial problem but lies at the root of all knowledge; it is necessary to begin somewhere, and to make progress one must clearly state those elements and relations which are undefined and those properties which are taken for granted.

==Examples==
The necessity for primitive notions is illustrated in several axiomatic foundations in mathematics:
* Set theory: The concept of the set is an example of a primitive notion. As Mary Tiles writes: [The] &#x27;definition&#x27; of &#x27;set&#x27; is less a definition than an attempt at explication of something which is being given the status of a primitive, undefined, term. As evidence, she quotes Felix Hausdorff: &quot;A set is formed by the grouping together of single objects into a whole. A set is a plurality thought of as a unit.&quot;
* Naive set theory: The empty set is a primitive notion. To assert that it exists would be an implicit axiom.
* Peano arithmetic: The successor function and the number zero are primitive notions. Since Peano arithmetic is useful in regards to properties of the numbers, the objects that the primitive notions represent may not strictly matter. 
* Arithmetic of real numbers: Typically, primitive notions are: real number, two binary operations: addition and multiplication, numbers 0 and 1, ordering &lt;. 
* Axiomatic systems: The primitive notions will depend upon the set of axioms chosen for the system. Alessandro Padoa discussed this selection at the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in 1900. The notions themselves may not necessarily need to be stated; Susan Haack (1978) writes, &quot;A set of axioms is sometimes said to give an implicit definition of its primitive terms.&quot;
* Euclidean geometry: Under Hilbert&#x27;s axiom system the primitive notions are &quot;point, line, plane, congruence, betweenness &quot;, and &quot;incidence&quot;.
* Euclidean geometry: Under Peano&#x27;s axiom system the primitive notions are &quot;point, segment&quot;, and &quot;motion&quot;.

==Russell&#x27;s primitives==
In his book on philosophy of mathematics, &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; Bertrand Russell used the following notions: for class-calculus (set theory), he used relations, taking set membership as a primitive notion. To establish sets, he also establishes propositional functions as primitive, as well as the phrase &quot;such that&quot; as used in set builder notation. (pp 18,9) Regarding relations, Russell takes as primitive notions the converse relation and complementary relation of a given &quot;xRy&quot;. Furthermore, logical products of relations and relative products of relations are primitive. (p 25) As for denotation of objects by description, Russell acknowledges that a primitive notion is involved. (p 27) The thesis of Russell’s book is &quot;Pure mathematics uses only a few notions, and these are logical constants.&quot; (p xxi)

<doc id="23707" wikidata="Q42603" url="?curid=23707" title="Priest">
<text>A priest is a religious leader authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities. They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities. Their office or position is the &quot;priesthood&quot;, a term which also may apply to such persons collectively. A priest may have the duty to hear confessions periodically, give marriage counseling, provide prenuptial counseling, give spiritual direction, teach catechism, or visit those confined indoors, such as the sick in hospitals and nursing homes.

== Description ==
According to the trifunctional hypothesis of prehistoric Proto-Indo-European society, priests have existed since the earliest of times and in the simplest societies, most likely as a result of agricultural surplus and consequent social stratification. The necessity to read sacred texts and keep temple or church records helped foster literacy in many early societies. Priests exist in many religions today, such as all or some branches of Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Shinto, and Hinduism. They are generally regarded as having privileged contact with the deity or deities of the religion to which they subscribe, often interpreting the meaning of events and performing the rituals of the religion. There is no common definition of the duties of priesthood between faiths; but generally it includes mediating the relationship between one&#x27;s congregation, worshippers, and other members of the religious body, and its deity or deities, and administering religious rituals and rites. These often include blessing worshipers with prayers of joy at marriages, after a birth, and at consecrations, teaching the wisdom and dogma of the faith at any regular worship service, and mediating and easing the experience of grief and death at funerals – maintaining a spiritual connection to the afterlife in faiths where such a concept exists. Administering religious building grounds and office affairs and papers, including any religious library or collection of sacred texts, is also commonly a responsibility – for example, the modern term for clerical duties in a secular office refers originally to the duties of a cleric. The question of which religions have a &quot;priest&quot; depends on how the titles of leaders are used or translated into English. In some cases, leaders are more like those that other believers will often turn to for advice on spiritual matters, and less of a &quot;person authorized to perform the sacred rituals.&quot; For example, clergy in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy are &quot;priests&quot;, as with certain synods of Lutheranism and Anglicanism, though other branches of Protestant Christianity, such as Methodists and Baptists, use &quot;minister&quot; and &quot;pastor.&quot; The terms &quot;priest&quot; and &quot;priestess&quot; are sufficiently generic that they may be used in an anthropological sense to describe the religious mediators of an unknown or otherwise unspecified religion.

In many religions, being a priest or priestess is a full-time position, ruling out any other career. Many Christian priests and pastors choose or are mandated to dedicate themselves to their churches and receive their living directly from their churches. In other cases, it is a part-time role. For example, in the early history of Iceland the chieftains were titled &quot;goði&quot;, a word meaning &quot;priest&quot;. As seen in the saga of Hrafnkell Freysgoði, however, being a priest consisted merely of offering periodic sacrifices to the Norse gods and goddesses; it was not a full-time role, nor did it involve ordination.

In some religions, being a priest or priestess is by human election or human choice. In Judaism, the priesthood is inherited in familial lines. In a theocracy, a society is governed by its priesthood.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;priest&quot;, is ultimately derived from Latin via Greek &quot;presbyter&quot;, the term for &quot;elder&quot;, especially elders of Jewish or Christian communities in late antiquity. The Latin &quot;presbyter&quot; ultimately represents Greek &quot;presbúteros&quot;, the regular Latin word for &quot;priest&quot; being &quot;sacerdos&quot;, corresponding to &quot;hiereús&quot;.

It is possible that the Latin word was loaned into Old English, and only from Old English reached other Germanic languages via the Anglo-Saxon mission to the continent, giving Old Icelandic &quot;prestr&quot;, Old Swedish &quot;präster&quot;, Old High German &quot;priast&quot;. Old High German also has the disyllabic &quot;priester, priestar&quot;, apparently derived from Latin independently via Old French &quot;presbtre&quot;.

An alternative theory makes &quot;priest&quot; cognate with Old High German &quot;priast&quot;, &quot;prest&quot;, from Vulgar Latin *&quot;prevost&quot; &quot;one put over others&quot;, from Latin &quot;praepositus&quot; &quot;person placed in charge&quot;.

That English should have only the single term &quot;priest&quot; to translate &quot;presbyter&quot; and &quot;sacerdos&quot; came to be seen as a problem in English Bible translations. The &quot;presbyter&quot; is the minister who both presides and instructs a Christian congregation, while the &quot;sacerdos&quot;, offerer of sacrifices, or in a Christian context the eucharist, performs &quot;mediatorial offices between God and man&quot;.

The feminine English noun, &quot;priestess&quot;, was coined in the 17th century, to refer to female priests of the pre-Christian religions of classical antiquity. In the 20th century, the word was used in controversies surrounding the women ordained in the Anglican communion, who are referred to as &quot;priests&quot;, irrespective of gender, and the term priestess is generally considered archaic in Christianity.

Webster&#x27;s 1829 Dictionary stated &quot;PRIEST, &quot;noun&quot; [Latin proestes, a chief, one that presides; proe, before, and sto, to stand, or sisto.]&quot; https://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/priest

== Historical religions ==

In historical polytheism, a priest administers the sacrifice to a deity, often in highly elaborate ritual. In the Ancient Near East, the priesthood also acted on behalf of the deities in managing their property.

Priestesses in antiquity often performed sacred prostitution, and in Ancient Greece, some priestesses such as Pythia, priestess at Delphi, acted as oracles.

=== Ancient priests and priestesses ===
* Sumerian (), including Enheduanna (), were top-ranking priests who were distinguished with special ceremonial attire and held equal status to high priests. They owned property, transacted business, and initiated the hieros gamos with priests and kings.
* Nadītu served as priestesses in the temples of Inanna in the city of Uruk. They were recruited from the highest families in the land and were supposed to remain childless, owned property, and transacted business.
* The Sumerian word , in Akkadian, is the sign for &quot;lady.&quot; (Akkadian &quot;entu&quot;), literally &quot;divine lady&quot;, a priestess.
* In Sumerian epic texts such as &quot;Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta&quot;, were priestesses in temples dedicated to Inanna and may be a reference to the goddess herself.
* Puabi of Ur was an Akkadian queen regnant or a priestess. In several other Sumerian city-states, the ruling governor or king was also a head priest with the rank of , such as at Lagash.
* Control of the holy city of Nippur and its temple priesthood generally meant hegemony over most of Sumer, as listed on the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;; at one point, the Nippur priesthood conferred the title of queen of Sumer on Kugbau, a popular taverness from nearby Kish (who was later deified as Kubaba).
* In the Hebrew Bible, &quot;qědēšā&quot;, derived from the root Q-D-Š were sacred prostitutes usually associated with the goddess Asherah.
* &quot;Quadishtu&quot; served in the temples of the Sumerian goddess Qetesh.
* &quot;Ishtaritu&quot; specialized in the arts of dancing, music, and singing and they served in the temples of Ishtar.
* In the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, priestess Shamhat, a temple prostitute, tamed wild Enkidu after &quot;six days and seven nights.&quot;
* &quot;Gerarai&quot;, fourteen Athenian matrons of Dionysus, presided over sacrifices and participated in the festivals of Anthesteria.

=== Ancient Egypt ===
In ancient Egyptian religion, the right and obligation to interact with the gods belonged to the pharaoh. He delegated this duty to priests, who were effectively bureaucrats authorized to act on his behalf. Priests staffed temples throughout Egypt, giving offerings to the cult images in which the gods were believed to take up residence and performing other rituals for their benefit. Little is known about what training may have been required of priests, and the selection of personnel for positions was affected by a tangled set of traditions, although the pharaoh had the final say. In the New Kingdom of Egypt, when temples owned great estates, the high priests of the most important cult—that of Amun at Karnak—were important political figures.

High-ranking priestly roles were usually held by men. Women were generally relegated to lower positions in the temple hierarchy, although some held specialized and influential positions, especially that of the God&#x27;s Wife of Amun, whose religious importance overshadowed the High Priests of Amun in the Late Period.

=== Ancient Rome ===

In ancient Rome and throughout Italy, the ancient sanctuaries of Ceres and Proserpina were invariably led by female &quot;sacerdotes&quot;, drawn from women of local and Roman elites. It was the only public priesthood attainable by Roman matrons and was held in great honor.

A Roman matron was any mature woman of the upper class, married or unmarried. Females could serve public cult as Vestal Virgins but few were chosen, and then only from young maidens of the upper class.

=== Ancient Greece ===
* The Pythia was the title of a priestess at the very ancient temple of Delphi that was dedicated to the Earth Mother. She was widely credited for her prophecies. The priestess retained her role when the temple was rededicated to Apollo, giving her a prominence unusual for a woman in the male-dominated culture of classical Greece.
* The Phrygian Sibyl was the priestess presiding over an Apollonian oracle at Phrygia, a historical kingdom in the Anatolian highlands.

==== Historical ====

After the departure of the Israelites from Egypt, priests in ancient Israel were required by the Law of Moses to be direct patrileneal descendants of Aaron, the elder brother of Moses. In Exodus 30:22–25 God instructs Moses to make a holy anointing-oil to consecrate the priests &quot;for all of eternity&quot;. During the times of the two Jewish Temples in Jerusalem, the Aaronic priests performed the daily and special Jewish-holiday offerings and sacrifices within the temples; these offerings are known as the &quot;korbanot&quot;.

In Hebrew, the word for &quot;priest&quot; is &quot;kohen&quot; (singular כהן &quot;kohen&quot;, plural כּהנִים &quot;kohanim&quot;), hence the family names &quot;Cohen&quot;, &quot;Cahn&quot;, &quot;Kahn&quot;, &quot;Kohn&quot;, &quot;Kogan&quot;, etc. Jewish families with these names belong to the tribe of Levi (Levites – descended from Levi, the great-grandfather of Aaron) and in twenty-four instances are called by scripture as such. In Hebrew, the word for &quot;priesthood&quot; is &quot;kehunnah&quot;.

The Hebrew word &quot;kohen&quot; comes from the root KWN/KON כ-ו-ן &#x27;to stand, to be ready, established&#x27; in the sense of &quot;someone who stands ready before God&quot;, and has cognates in other Semitic languages, e.g. Phoenician KHN 𐤊𐤄𐤍 &quot;priest&quot; or Arabic &quot;kahin&quot; كاهن &quot;priest&quot;.

==== Modern Judaism ====

Since the destruction of the Second Temple, and (therefore) the cessation of the daily and seasonal temple ceremonies and sacrifices, kohanim have become much less prominent. In traditional Judaism (Orthodox Judaism and to some extent, Conservative Judaism) a few priestly and Levitical functions, such as the &quot;pidyon haben&quot; (redemption of a first-born son) ceremony and the Priestly Blessing, have been retained. Especially in Orthodox Judaism, kohanim remain subject to a number of restrictions concerning matters related to marriage and ritual purity.

Orthodox Judaism regard the kohanim as being held in reserve for a future restored Temple. Kohanim do not perform roles of propitiation, sacrifice, or sacrament in any branch of Rabbinical Judaism or in Karaite Judaism. The principal religious function of any kohanim is to perform the Priestly Blessing, although an individual kohen may also become a rabbi or other professional religious leader.

===== Beta Israel =====
The traditional Beta Israel community in Israel had little direct contact with other Jewish groups after the destruction of the temple and developed separately for almost two thousand years. While some Beta Israel now follow Rabbinical Jewish practices, the Ethiopian Jewish religious tradition (Haymanot) uses the word Kahen to refer to a type non-hereditary cleric.

=== Samaritanism ===
Aaronic Kohanim also officiated at the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim. The Samaritan kohanim have retained their role as religious leaders.

=== Christianity ===
With the spread of Christianity and the formation of parishes, the Greek word &quot;hiereús&quot; and Latin word &quot;sacerdos&quot;, which Christians had since the 3rd century applied to bishops and only in a secondary sense to presbyters, began in the 6th century to be used of presbyters, and is today commonly used of presbyters, distinguishing them from bishops.

Today, the term &quot;priest&quot; is used in the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Church of the East, and many branches of Lutheranism and Anglicanism, to refer to those who have been ordained to a ministerial position through receiving the sacrament of Holy Orders, although &quot;presbyter&quot; is also used. Since the Protestant Reformation, non-sacramental denominations are more likely to use the term &quot;elder&quot; to refer to their pastors. The Christian term &quot;priest&quot; does not have an entry in the Anchor Bible Dictionary, but the dictionary does deal with the above-mentioned terms under the entry for &quot;Sheep, Shepherd.&quot;.
==== Eastern Orthodoxy ====
In Orthodoxy, the normal minimum age is thirty (Can. 11 of Neocaesarea) but a bishop may dispense with this if needed. In neither tradition may priests marry after ordination. In the Catholic Church, priests in the Latin Church must be celibate except under special rules for married clergy converting from certain other Christian confessions. Married men may become priests in Eastern Orthodoxy, but cannot marry after ordination, even if they become widowed. In the view of the Eastern Orthodox Churches:

Candidates for bishop are chosen only from among the celibate. Orthodox priests will either wear a clerical collar similar to the above-mentioned, or simply a very loose black robe that does not have a collar. The garb of an Eastern Orthodox priest is generally the same as that of an Eastern Catholic or Eastern Lutheran priest.

==== Oriental Orthodoxy ====
In the Oriental Orthodox Churches, there are different orders of ministry, each with different vestments. The order of the priest is known as the &quot;Kashisho&quot;.

In addition to the ministerial priesthood, Oriental Orthodoxy does affirm the priesthood of believers, which is called the &quot;Ulmoyo&quot;.

==== Catholicism ====
The most significant liturgical acts reserved to priests in these traditions are the administration of the Sacraments, including the celebration of the Holy Mass or Divine Liturgy (the terms for the celebration of the Eucharist in the Latin and Byzantine traditions, respectively), and the Sacrament of Reconciliation, also called Confession. The sacraments of Anointing of the Sick (Extreme Unction) and Confirmation are also administered by priests, though in the Western tradition Confirmation is ordinarily celebrated by a bishop. In the East, Chrismation is performed by the priest (using oil specially consecrated by a bishop) immediately after Baptism, and Unction is normally performed by several priests (ideally seven), but may be performed by one if necessary. In the West, Holy Baptism may be celebrated by anyone. The Vatican catechism states that &quot;According to Latin tradition, the spouses as ministers of Christ&#x27;s grace mutually confer upon each other the sacrament of Matrimony&quot;. Thus marriage is a sacrament administered by the couple to themselves, but may be witnessed and blessed by a deacon, or priest (who usually administers the ceremony). In the East, Holy Baptism and Marriage (which is called &quot;Crowning&quot;) may be performed only by a priest. If a person is baptized &quot;in extremis&quot; (i.e., when in fear of immediate death), only the actual threefold immersion together with the scriptural words may be performed by a layperson or deacon. The remainder of the rite, and Chrismation, must still be performed by a priest, if the person survives. The only sacrament which may be celebrated only by a bishop is that of Ordination (&quot;cheirotonia&quot;, &quot;Laying-on of Hands&quot;), or Holy Orders.

In these traditions, only men who meet certain requirements may become priests. In Catholicism, the canonical minimum age is twenty-five. Bishops may dispense with this rule and ordain men up to one year younger. Dispensations of more than a year are reserved to the Holy See (Can. 1031 §§ 1, 4.) A Catholic priest must be incardinated by his bishop or his major religious superior in order to engage in public ministry. Secular priests are incardinated into a diocese, whereas religious priests live the consecrated life and can work anywhere in the world that their specific community operates.

Married men may become priests in the Eastern Catholic Churches, but cannot marry after ordination, even if they become widowed. 

==== Lutheranism ====

Conservative Lutheran reforms are reflected in the theological and practical view of the ministry of the church. Much of European Lutheranism follows the traditional Catholic governance of deacon, priest, and bishop. The Lutheran archbishops of Finland, Sweden, etc. and Baltic countries are the historic national primates and some ancient cathedrals and parishes in the Lutheran church were constructed many centuries before the Reformation. Indeed, ecumenical work within the Moravian Church, Anglican Communion and among Scandinavian Lutherans mutually recognize the historic apostolic legitimacy and full communion. Likewise in America, Lutherans have embraced the apostolic succession of bishops in the full communion with Moravians and Episcopalians. Most Lutheran ordinations are performed by a bishop.

The Church of Sweden has a threefold ministry of bishop, priest, and deacon and those ordained to the presbyterate are referred to as priests. In the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, ordained presbyters are referred to by various publications, including Finnish ones, as pastors, or priests. In the United States, denominations like the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod use the terms &quot;reverend&quot; and &quot;pastor&quot; interchangeably for ordained members of the clergy; the Lutheran Church - International, a Confessional Lutheran denomination of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship, uses the term &quot;priest&quot; for those ordained to the presbyterate, who are addressed as &quot;Father&quot;.

Apart from the ministerial priesthood, the general priesthood or the priesthood of all believers, is a Christian doctrine derived from several passages of the New Testament. It is a foundational concept of Protestantism. It is this doctrine that Martin Luther adduces in his 1520 &quot;To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation&quot; in order to dismiss the medieval Christian belief that Christians were to be divided into two classes: &quot;spiritual&quot; and &quot;temporal&quot; or non-spiritual.

====Anglican or Episcopalian====
The role of a priest in the Anglican Communion and the Free Church of England is largely the same as within the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Christianity, except that canon law in almost every Anglican province restricts the administration of confirmation to the bishop, just as with ordination. Although Anglican priests who are members of religious orders must remain celibate (although there are exceptions, such as priests in the Anglican Order of Cistercians), the secular clergy—bishops, priests, and deacons who are not members of religious orders—are permitted to marry before or after ordination (although in most provinces they are not permitted to marry a person of the same sex). The Anglican churches, unlike the Roman Catholic or Eastern Christian traditions, have allowed the ordination of women as priests (referred to as &quot;priests&quot; not &quot;priestesses&quot;) in some provinces since 1971. This practice remains controversial, however; a minority of provinces (10 out of the 38 worldwide) retain an all-male priesthood. Most Continuing Anglican churches do not ordain women to the priesthood.

As Anglicanism represents a broad range of theological opinion, its presbyterate includes priests who consider themselves no different in any respect from those of the Roman Catholic Church, and a minority who prefer to use the title &quot;presbyter&quot; in order to distance themselves from the more sacrificial theological implications which they associate with the word &quot;priest&quot;.

While &quot;priest&quot; is the official title of a member of the presbyterate in every Anglican province worldwide (retained by the Elizabethan Settlement), the ordination rite of certain provinces (including the Church of England) recognizes the breadth of opinion by adopting the title &quot;The Ordination of Priests (also called Presbyters).&quot; Even though both words mean &#x27;elders&#x27; historically the term &quot;priest&quot; has been more associated with the &quot;High Church&quot; or Anglo-Catholic wing, whereas the term &quot;minister&quot; has been more commonly used in &quot;Low Church&quot; or Evangelical circles.

==== Methodism ====
Methodist clergy often have the title of pastor, minister, reverend, etc.

==== Latter Day Saints ====

In the Latter Day Saint movement, the priesthood is the power and authority of God given to man, including the authority to perform ordinances and to act as a leader in the church. A body of priesthood holders is referred to as a quorum. Priesthood denotes elements of both power and authority. The priesthood includes the power Jesus gave his apostles to perform miracles such as the casting out of devils and the healing of sick (Luke 9:1). Latter Day Saints believe that the Biblical miracles performed by prophets and apostles were performed by the power of the priesthood, including the miracles of Jesus, who holds all of the keys of the priesthood. The priesthood is formally known as the &quot;Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God&quot;, but to avoid the too frequent use of the name of deity, the priesthood is referred to as the Melchizedek priesthood (Melchizedek being the high priest to whom Abraham paid tithes). As an authority, the priesthood is the authority by which a bearer may perform ecclesiastical acts of service in the name of God. Latter Day Saints believe that acts (and in particular, ordinances) performed by one with priesthood authority are recognized by God and are binding in heaven, on earth, and in the afterlife.

There is some variation among the Latter Day Saint denominations regarding who can be ordained to the priesthood. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), all worthy males above the age of 12 can be ordained to the priesthood. However, prior to a policy change in 1978, the LDS Church did not ordain men or boys who were of black African descent. The LDS Church does not ordain women to any of its priesthood offices. The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now the Community of Christ), the second largest denomination of the movement, began ordaining women to all of its priesthood offices in 1984. This decision was one of the reasons that led to a schism in the church, which prompted the formation of the independent Restoration Branches movement from which other denominations have sprung, including the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

=== Islam ===

Islam has no sacerdotal priesthood. There are, however, a variety of academic and administrative offices which have evolved to assist Muslims with this task, such as the imāms and the mullāhs.

=== Mandaeism ===

A Mandaean priest refers to an ordained religious leader in Mandaeism. In Mandaean scriptures, priests are referred to as &quot;Naṣuraiia&quot; (Naṣoraeans). All priests must undergo lengthy ordination ceremonies, beginning with tarmida initiation. Mandaean religious leaders and copyists of religious texts hold the title &quot;Rabbi&quot; or in Arabic &#x27;Sheikh&#x27;.

All Mandaean communities traditionally require the presence of a priest, since priests are required to officiate over all important religious rituals, including masbuta, masiqta, birth and wedding ceremonies. Priests also serve as teachers, scribes, and community leaders.

There are three types of priests in Mandaeism:

*&quot;rišama&quot; &quot;leader of the people&quot;
*&quot;ganzibria&quot; &quot;treasurers&quot; (from Old Persian &quot;ganza-bara&quot; &quot;id.,&quot; Neo-Mandaic &quot;ganzeḇrānā&quot;)
*&quot;tarmidia&quot; &quot;disciples&quot; (Neo-Mandaic &quot;tarmidānā&quot;)

Priests have lineages based on the succession of &quot;ganzibria&quot; priests who had initiated them. Priestly lineages, which are distinct from birth lineages, are typically recorded in the colophons of many Mandaean texts. The position is not hereditary, and any Mandaean male who is highly knowledgeable about religious matters is eligible to become a priest.

== Eastern religions ==
=== Hinduism ===
A Hindu priest traditionally comes from the Brahmin community. Priests are ordained and trained as well. There are two types of Hindu priests, &quot;pujaris&quot; (&quot;swamis&quot;, &quot;yogis&quot;, and &quot;gurus&quot;) and &quot;purohitas&quot; (&quot;pandits&quot;). A &quot;pujari&quot; performs rituals in a temple. These rituals include bathing the &quot;murti&quot;s (the statues of the gods/goddesses), performing &quot;puja&quot;, a ritualistic offering of various items to the gods, the waving of a &quot;ghee&quot; or oil lamp also called an offering in light, known in Hinduism as &quot;aarti&quot;, before the &quot;murtis&quot;. &quot;Pujaris&quot; are often married.

A &quot;purohita&quot;, on the other hand, performs rituals and saṃskāras (sacraments), yajnas (sacrifices) outside of the temple. There are special &quot;purohitas&quot; who perform only funeral rites.

In many cases, a &quot;purohita&quot; also functions as a &quot;pujari&quot;.

While only men have traditionally been ordained as priests in the past, recent developments such as feminism in India have led to the opening of training schools for women to become priests.

=== Zoroastrianism ===
A Zoroastrian priest are called a Mobad and they officiate the &quot;Yasna&quot;, pouring libations into the sacred fire to the accompaniment of ritual chants. The Mobad also prepare drinks for the &quot;haoma&quot; ritual.

In Indian Zoroastrianism, the priesthood is reserved for men and is a mostly hereditary position, but women have been ordained in Iran and North America as a mobedyar, meaning an assistant mobed.

=== Taoism ===

The Taoist priests (道士 &quot;master of the Dao&quot; p. 488) act as interpreters of the principles of Yin-Yang 5 elements (fire, water, soil, wood, and metal p. 53) school of ancient Chinese philosophy, as they relate to marriage, death, festival cycles, and so on. The Taoist priest seeks to share the benefits of meditation with his or her community through public ritual and liturgy (p. 326). In the ancient priesthood before the Tang, the priest was called &quot;Jijiu&quot; (&quot;libationer&quot; p. 550), with both male and female practitioners selected by merit. The system gradually changed into a male only hereditary Taoist priesthood until more recent times (p. 550,551).

== Indigenous and ethnic religions ==
=== Shinto ===
The Shinto priest is called a &quot;, originally pronounced &quot;kamunushi&quot;, sometimes referred to as a . A kannushi is the person responsible for the maintenance of a Shinto shrine, or &quot;jinja&quot;, purificatory rites, and for leading worship and veneration of a certain &quot;kami&quot;. Additionally, &quot;kannushi&quot; are aided by another priest class, &quot;, for many rites. The maidens may either be family members in training, apprentices, or local volunteers.

&quot;Saiin&quot; were female relatives of the Japanese emperor (termed &quot;saiō&quot;) who served as High Priestesses in Kamo Shrine. &quot;Saiō&quot; also served at Ise Shrine. &quot;Saiin&quot; priestesses usually were elected from royalty. In principle, &quot;Saiin&quot; remained unmarried, but there were exceptions. Some &quot;Saiin&quot; became consorts of the emperor, called &quot;Nyōgo&quot; in Japanese. The &quot;Saiin&quot; order of priestesses existed throughout the Heian and Kamakura periods.

=== Africa ===
The Yoruba people of western Nigeria practice an indigenous religion with a chiefly hierarchy of priests and priestesses that dates to AD 800–1000. Ifá priests and priestesses bear the titles Babalawo for men and Iyanifa for women. Priests and priestesses of the varied Orisha are titled Babalorisa for men and Iyalorisa for women. Initiates are also given an Orisa or Ifá name that signifies under which deity they are initiated. For example, a Priestess of Osun may be named Osunyemi, and a Priest of Ifá may be named Ifáyemi. This traditional culture continues to this day as initiates from all around the world return to Nigeria for initiation into the priesthood, and varied derivative sects in the New World (such as Cuban Santería and Brazilian Umbanda) use the same titles to refer to their officers as well.

In a kingdom, tribe or clan in Africa the traditional leader is also a priest cause of his mission between the spirit of ancestors ( Throne ) and people. Everything the traditional ruler must do, is according to the ritual, ceremony and worship. They call him sometimes royal Priest.

=== Afro-Latin American religions ===
In Brazil, the priests in the Umbanda, Candomblé and Quimbanda religions are called &quot;pai-de-santo&quot; (literally &quot;Father of saint&quot; in English), or &quot;babalorixá&quot; (a word borrowed from Yoruba &quot;bàbálórìsà&quot;, meaning &quot;Father of the Orisha&quot;); its female equivalent is the &quot;mãe-de-santo&quot; (&quot;Mother of saint&quot;), also referred to as &quot;ialorixá&quot; (Yoruba: &quot;iyálórìsà&quot;).

In the Cuban Santería, a male priest is called &quot;Santero&quot;, while female priests are called &quot;Iyanifas&quot; or &quot;mothers of wisdom&quot;.

== Neo-paganism ==

=== Wicca ===

According to traditional Wiccan beliefs, every member of the religion is considered a priestess or priest, as it is believed that no person can stand between another and the divine. However, in response to the growing number of Wiccan temples and churches, several denominations of the religion have begun to develop a core group of ordained priestesses and priests serving a larger laity. This trend is far from widespread, but is gaining acceptance due to increased interest in the religion.

== Dress ==
The dress of religious workers in ancient times may be demonstrated in frescoes and artifacts from the cultures. The dress is presumed to be related to the customary clothing of the culture, with some symbol of the deity worn on the head or held by the person. Sometimes special colors, materials, or patterns distinguish celebrants, as the white wool veil draped on the head of the Vestal Virgins.

Occasionally, the celebrants at religious ceremonies shed all clothes in a symbolic gesture of purity. This was often the case in ancient times. An example of this is shown to the left on a Kylix dating from c. 500 BC where a priestess is featured. Modern religious groups tend to avoid such symbolism and some may be quite uncomfortable with the concept.

The retention of long skirts and vestments among many ranks of contemporary priests when they officiate may be interpreted to express the ancient traditions of the cultures from which their religious practices arose.

In most Christian traditions, priests wear clerical clothing, a distinctive form of street dress. Even within individual traditions it varies considerably in form, depending on the specific occasion. In Western Christianity, the stiff white clerical collar has become the nearly universal feature of priestly clerical clothing, worn either with a cassock or a clergy shirt. The collar may be either a full collar or a vestigial tab displayed through a square cutout in the shirt collar.

Eastern Christian priests mostly retain the traditional dress of two layers of differently cut cassock: the &quot;rasson&quot; (Greek) or &quot;podriasnik&quot; (Russian) beneath the outer &quot;exorasson&quot; (Greek) or &quot;riasa&quot; (Russian). If a pectoral cross has been awarded it is usually worn with street clothes in the Russian tradition, but not so often in the Greek tradition.

Distinctive clerical clothing is less often worn in modern times than formerly, and in many cases it is rare for a priest to wear it when not acting in a pastoral capacity, especially in countries that view themselves as largely secular in nature. There are frequent exceptions to this however, and many priests rarely if ever go out in public without it, especially in countries where their religion makes up a clear majority of the population. Pope John Paul II often instructed Catholic priests and religious to always wear their distinctive (clerical) clothing, unless wearing it would result in persecution or grave verbal attacks.

Christian traditions that retain the title of priest also retain the tradition of special liturgical vestments worn only during services. Vestments vary widely among the different Christian traditions.

In modern Pagan religions, such as Wicca, there is no one specific form of dress designated for the clergy. If there is, it is a particular of the denomination in question, and not a universal practice. However, there is a traditional form of dress, (usually a floor-length tunic and a knotted cord cincture, known as the &quot;cingulum&quot;), which is often worn by worshipers during religious rites. Among those traditions of Wicca that do dictate a specific form of dress for its clergy, they usually wear the traditional tunic in addition to other articles of clothing (such as an open-fronted robe or a cloak) as a distinctive form of religious dress, similar to a habit.

== Assistant priest ==
In many religions, there are one or more layers of assistant priests.

In the Ancient Near East, hierodules served in temples as assistants to the priestess.

In ancient Judaism, the Priests (Kohanim) had a whole class of Levites as their assistants in making the sacrifices, in singing psalms and in maintaining the Temple. The Priests and the Levites were in turn served by servants called Nethinim. These lowest level of servants were not priests.

An assistant priest is a priest in the Anglican and Episcopal churches who is not the senior member of clergy of the parish to which they are appointed, but is nonetheless in priests&#x27; orders; there is no difference in function or theology, merely in &#x27;grade&#x27; or &#x27;rank&#x27;. Some assistant priests have a &quot;sector ministry&quot;, that is to say that they specialize in a certain area of ministry within the local church, for example youth work, hospital work, or ministry to local light industry. They may also hold some diocesan appointment part-time. In most (though not all) cases, an assistant priest has the legal status of assistant curate, although not all assistant curates are priests, as this legal status also applies to many deacons working as assistants in a parochial setting.

The corresponding term in the Catholic Church is &quot;parochial vicar&quot; – an ordained priest assigned to assist the pastor (Latin: &quot;parochus&quot;) of a parish in the pastoral care of parishioners. Normally, all pastors are also ordained priests; occasionally an auxiliary bishop will be assigned that role.

In Wicca, the leader of a coven or temple (either a high priestess or high priest) often appoints an assistant. This assistant is often called a &#x27;deputy&#x27;, but the more traditional terms &#x27;maiden&#x27; (when female and assisting a high priestess) and &#x27;summoner&#x27; (when male and assisting a high priest) are still used in many denominations.

<text>PL/I (Programming Language One, pronounced and sometimes written PL/1) is a procedural, imperative computer programming language initially developed by IBM. It is designed for scientific, engineering, business and system programming. It has been in continuous use by academic, commercial and industrial organizations since it was introduced in the 1960s.

The PL/I ANSI standard, X3.53-1976, was published in 1976.

PL/I&#x27;s main domains are data processing, numerical computation, scientific computing, and system programming. It supports recursion, structured programming, linked data structure handling, fixed-point, floating-point, complex, character string handling, and bit string handling. The language syntax is English-like and suited for describing complex data formats with a wide set of functions available to verify and manipulate them.

==Early history==
In the 1950s and early 1960s, business and scientific users programmed for different computer hardware using different programming languages. Business users were moving from Autocoders via COMTRAN to COBOL, while scientific users programmed in Fortran, ALGOL, GEORGE, and others. The IBM System/360 (announced in 1964 and delivered in 1966) was designed as a common machine architecture for both groups of users, superseding all existing IBM architectures. Similarly, IBM wanted a single programming language for all users. It hoped that Fortran could be extended to include the features needed by commercial programmers. In October 1963 a committee was formed composed originally of three IBMers from New York and three members of SHARE, the IBM
scientific users group, to propose these extensions to Fortran. Given the constraints of Fortran, they were unable to do this and embarked on the design of a new programming language based loosely on ALGOL labeled NPL. This acronym conflicted with that of the UK&#x27;s National Physical Laboratory and was replaced briefly by MPPL (MultiPurpose Programming Language) and, in 1965, with PL/I (with a Roman numeral &quot;I&quot;). The first definition appeared in April 1964.

IBM took NPL as a starting point and completed the design to a level that the first compiler could be written: the NPL definition was incomplete in scope and in detail. Control of the PL/I language was vested initially in the New York Programming Center and later at the IBM UK Laboratory at Hursley. The SHARE and GUIDE user groups were involved in extending the language and had a role in IBM&#x27;s process for controlling the language through their PL/I Projects. The experience of defining such a large language showed the need for a formal definition of PL/I. A project was set up in 1967 in IBM Laboratory Vienna to make an unambiguous and complete specification. This led in turn to one of the first large scale Formal Methods for development, VDM.

Fred Brooks is credited with ensuring PL/I had the CHARACTER data type.

The language was first specified in detail in the manual &quot;PL/I Language Specifications. C28-6571&quot;, written in New York in 1965, and superseded by &quot;PL/I Language Specifications. GY33-6003&quot;, written by Hursley in 1967. IBM continued to develop PL/I in the late sixties and early seventies, publishing it in the GY33-6003 manual. These manuals were used by the Multics group and other early implementers.

The first compiler was delivered in 1966. The Standard for PL/I was approved in 1976.

==Goals and principles==
The goals for PL/I evolved during the early development of the language. Competitiveness with COBOL&#x27;s record handling and report writing was required. The language&#x27;s scope of usefulness grew to include system programming and event-driven programming. Additional goals for PL/I were:

* Performance of compiled code competitive with that of Fortran (but this was not achieved) 
* Extensibility for new hardware and new application areas
* Improved productivity of the programming process, transferring effort from the programmer to the compiler
* Machine independence to operate effectively on the main computer hardware and operating systems

To achieve these goals, PL/I borrowed ideas from contemporary languages while adding substantial new capabilities and casting it with a distinctive concise and readable syntax. Many principles and capabilities combined to give the language its character and were important in meeting the language&#x27;s goals:

* Block structure, with underlying semantics (including recursion), similar to Algol 60. Arguments are passed using call by reference, using dummy variables for values where needed (call by value).
* A wide range of computational data types, program control data types, and forms of data structure (strong typing).
* Dynamic extents for arrays and strings with inheritance of extents by procedure parameters.
* Concise syntax for expressions, declarations, and statements with permitted abbreviations. Suitable for a character set of 60 glyphs and sub-settable to 48.
* An extensive structure of defaults in statements, options, and declarations to hide some complexities and facilitate extending the language while minimizing keystrokes.
* Powerful iterative processing with good support for structured programming.
* There were to be no reserved words (although the function names codice_1 and codice_2 initially proved to be impossible to meet this goal). New attributes, statements and statement options could be added to PL/I without invalidating existing programs. Not even codice_3, and codice_4 were reserved.
* Orthogonality: each capability to be independent of other capabilities and freely combined with other capabilities wherever meaningful. Each capability to be available in all contexts where meaningful, to exploit it as widely as possible and to avoid &quot;arbitrary restrictions&quot;. Orthogonality helps make the language &quot;large&quot;.
* Exception handling capabilities for controlling and intercepting exceptional conditions at run time.
* Programs divided into separately compilable sections, with extensive compile-time facilities (a.k.a. macros), not part of the standard, for tailoring and combining sections of source code into complete programs. External names to bind separately compiled procedures into a single program.
* Debugging facilities integrated into the language.

==Language summary==
The language is designed to provide sufficient facilities to be able to satisfy the needs of all programmers, regardless of what problems the language is being applied to. The summary is extracted from the ANSI PL/I Standard
and the ANSI PL/I General-Purpose Subset Standard.

A PL/I program consists of a set of procedures, each of which is written as a sequence of statements. The codice_5 construct is used to include text from other sources during program translation. All of the statement types are summarized here in groupings which give an overview of the language (the Standard uses this organization).

(Features such as multi-tasking and the PL/I preprocessor are not in the Standard but are supported in the PL/I F compiler and some other implementations are discussed in the Language evolution section.)

Names may be declared to represent data of the following types, either as single values, or as aggregates in the form of arrays, with a lower-bound and upper-bound per dimension, or structures (comprising nested structure, array and scalar variables):
The codice_6 type comprises these attributes:

The base, scale, precision and scale factor of the codice_7 type is encoded within the codice_8. The mode is specified separately, with the codice_9 applied to both the real and the imaginary parts.

Values are computed by expressions written using a specific set of operations and builtin functions, most of which may be applied to aggregates as well as to single values, together with user-defined procedures which, likewise, may operate on and return aggregate as well as single values. The assignment statement assigns values to one or more variables.

There are no reserved words in PL/I. A statement is terminated by a semi-colon. The maximum length of a statement is implementation defined. A comment may appear anywhere in a program where a space is permitted and is preceded by the characters forward slash, asterisk and is terminated by the characters asterisk, forward slash (i.e. ). Statements may have a label-prefix introducing an entry name (codice_10 and codice_11 statements) or label name, and a condition prefix enabling or disabling a computational condition e.g. codice_12). Entry and label names may be single identifiers or identifiers followed by a subscript list of constants (as in codice_13).

A sequence of statements becomes a &quot;group&quot; when preceded by a codice_4 statement and followed by an codice_15 statement. Groups may include nested groups and begin blocks. The codice_16 statement specifies a group or a single statement as the codice_17 part and the codice_18 part (see the sample program). The group is the unit of iteration. The begin &quot;block&quot; (codice_19) may contain declarations for names and internal procedures local to the block. A &quot;procedure&quot; starts with a codice_11 statement and is terminated syntactically by an codice_15 statement. The body of a procedure is a sequence of blocks, groups, and statements and contains declarations for names and procedures local to the procedure or codice_22 to the procedure.

An &quot;ON-unit&quot; is a single statement or block of statements written to be executed when one or more of these &quot;conditions&quot; occur:

a &quot;computational condition&quot;,

or an &quot;Input/Output&quot; condition,

or one of the conditions:
*codice_23, codice_24, codice_25, codice_26

A declaration of an identifier may contain one or more of the following attributes (but they need to be mutually consistent):

Current compilers from Micro Focus, and particularly that from IBM implement many extensions over the standardized version of the language. The IBM extensions are summarised in the Implementation sub-section for the compiler later. Although there are some extensions common to these compilers the lack of a current standard means that compatibility is not guaranteed.

==Standardization==
Language standardization began in April 1966 in Europe with ECMA TC10. In 1969 ANSI established a &quot;Composite Language Development Committee&quot;, nicknamed &quot;Kludge&quot;, later renamed X3J1 PL/I. Standardization became a joint effort of ECMA TC/10 and ANSI X3J1. A subset of the GY33-6003 document was offered to the joint effort by IBM and became the base document for standardization. The major features omitted from the base document were multitasking and the attributes for program optimization (e.g. codice_27 and codice_28).

Proposals to change the base document were voted upon by both committees. In the event that the committees disagreed, the chairs, initially Michael Marcotty of General Motors and C.A.R. Hoare representing ICL had to resolve the disagreement. In addition to IBM, Honeywell, CDC, Data General, Digital Equipment Corporation, Prime Computer, Burroughs, RCA, and Univac served on X3J1 along with major users Eastman Kodak, MITRE, Union Carbide, Bell Laboratories, and various government and university representatives. Further development of the language occurred in the standards bodies, with continuing improvements in structured programming and internal consistency, and with the omission of the more obscure or contentious features.

As language development neared an end, X3J1/TC10 realized that there were a number of problems with a document written in English text. Discussion of a single item might appear in multiple places which might or might not agree. It was difficult to determine if there were omissions as well as inconsistencies. Consequently, David Beech (IBM), Robert Freiburghouse (Honeywell), Milton Barber (CDC), M. Donald MacLaren (Argonne National Laboratory), Craig Franklin (Data General), Lois Frampton (Digital Equipment Corporation), and editor, D.J. Andrews of IBM undertook to rewrite the entire document, each producing one or more complete chapters. The standard is couched as a formal definition using a &quot;PL/I Machine&quot; to specify the semantics. It was the first programming language standard to be written as a semi-formal definition.

A &quot;PL/I General-Purpose Subset&quot; (&quot;Subset-G&quot;) standard was issued by ANSI in 1981 and a revision published in 1987. The General Purpose subset was widely adopted as the kernel for PL/I implementations.

==Implementations==

===IBM PL/I F and D compilers===
PL/I was first implemented by IBM, at its Hursley Laboratories in the United Kingdom, as part of the development of System/360. The first production PL/I compiler was the PL/I F compiler for the OS/360 Operating System, built by John Nash&#x27;s team at Hursley in the UK: the runtime library team was managed by I.M. (Nobby) Clarke. The PL/I F compiler was written entirely in System/360 assembly language. Release 1 shipped in 1966. OS/360 is a real-memory environment and the compiler was designed for systems with as little as 64 kilobytes of real storage – F being 64 kB in S/360 parlance. To fit a large compiler into the 44 kilobytes of memory available on a 64-kilobyte machine, the compiler consists of a control phase and a large number of compiler phases (approaching 100). The phases are brought into memory from disk, one at a time, to handle particular language features and aspects of compilation. Each phase makes a single pass over the partially-compiled program, usually held in memory.

Aspects of the language were still being designed as PL/I F was implemented, so some were omitted until later releases. PL/I RECORD I/O was shipped with PL/I F Release 2. The list processing functions Based Variables, Pointers, Areas and Offsets and LOCATE-mode I/O were first shipped in Release 4. In a major attempt to speed up PL/I code to compete with Fortran object code, PL/I F Release 5 does substantial program optimization of DO-loops facilitated by the REORDER option on procedures.

A version of PL/I F was released on the TSS/360 timesharing operating system for the System/360 Model 67, adapted at the IBM Mohansic Lab. The IBM La Gaude Lab in France developed &quot;Language Conversion Programs&quot; to convert Fortran, Cobol, and Algol programs to the PL/I F level of PL/I.

The PL/I D compiler, using 16 kilobytes of memory, was developed by IBM Germany for the DOS/360 low end operating system. It implements a subset of the PL/I language requiring all strings and arrays to have fixed extents, thus simplifying the run-time environment. Reflecting the underlying operating system, it lacks dynamic storage allocation and the &quot;controlled&quot; storage class. It was shipped within a year of PL/I F.

===Multics PL/I and derivatives===
Compilers were implemented by several groups in the early 1960s. The Multics project at MIT, one of the first to develop an operating system in a high-level language, used Early PL/I (EPL), a subset dialect of PL/I, as their implementation language in 1964. EPL was developed at Bell Labs and MIT by Douglas McIlroy, Robert Morris, and others. Initially, it was developed using the TMG compiler-compiler. The influential Multics PL/I compiler [sic &quot;PL/1&quot;] was the source of compiler technology used by a number of manufacturers and software groups. EPL was a system programming language and a dialect of PL/I that had some capabilities absent in the original PL/I.

The Honeywell PL/I compiler (for Series 60) is an implementation of the full ANSI X3J1 standard.

===IBM PL/I optimizing and checkout compilers===
The PL/I Optimizer and Checkout compilers produced in Hursley support a common level of PL/I language and aimed to replace the PL/I F compiler. The checkout compiler is a rewrite of PL/I F in BSL, IBM&#x27;s PL/I-like proprietary implementation language (later PL/S). The performance objectives set for the compilers are shown in an IBM presentation to the BCS. The compilers had to produce identical results the Checkout Compiler is used to debug programs that would then be submitted to the Optimizer. Given that the compilers had entirely different designs and were handling the full PL/I language this goal was challenging: it was achieved.

IBM introduced new attributes and syntax including , case statements (//), loop controls ( and ) and null argument lists to disambiguate, e.g., codice_29.

The PL/I optimizing compiler took over from the PL/I F compiler and was IBM&#x27;s workhorse compiler from the 1970s to the 1990s. Like PL/I F, it is a multiple pass compiler with a 44 kilobyte design point, but it is an entirely new design. Unlike the F compiler, it has to perform compile time evaluation of constant expressions using the run-time library, reducing the maximum memory for a compiler phase to 28 kilobytes. A second-time around design, it succeeded in eliminating the annoyances of PL/I F such as cascading diagnostics. It was written in S/360 Macro Assembler by a team, led by Tony Burbridge, most of whom had worked on PL/I F. Macros were defined to automate common compiler services and to shield the compiler writers from the task of managing real-mode storage, allowing the compiler to be moved easily to other memory models. The gamut of program optimization techniques developed for the contemporary IBM Fortran H compiler were deployed: the Optimizer equaled Fortran execution speeds in the hands of good programmers. Announced with IBM S/370 in 1970, it shipped first for the DOS/360 operating system in August 1971, and shortly afterward for OS/360, and the first virtual memory IBM operating systems OS/VS1, MVS, and VM/CMS. (The developers were unaware that while they were shoehorning the code into 28 kb sections, IBM Poughkeepsie was finally ready to ship virtual memory support in OS/360). It supported the batch programming environments and, under TSO and CMS, it could be run interactively. This compiler went through many versions covering all mainframe operating systems including the operating systems of the Japanese plug-compatible machines (PCMs).

The compiler has been superseded by &quot;IBM PL/I for OS/2, AIX, Linux, z/OS&quot; below.

The PL/I checkout compiler, (colloquially &quot;The Checker&quot;) announced in August 1970 was designed to speed and improve the debugging of PL/I programs. The team was led by Brian Marks. The three-pass design cut the time to compile a program to 25% of that taken by the F Compiler. It can be run from an interactive terminal, converting PL/I programs into an internal format, &quot;H-text&quot;. This format is interpreted by the Checkout compiler at run-time, detecting virtually all types of errors. Pointers are represented in 16 bytes, containing the target address and a description of the referenced item, thus permitting &quot;bad&quot; pointer use to be diagnosed. In a conversational environment when an error is detected, control is passed to the user who can inspect any variables, introduce debugging statements and edit the source program. Over time the debugging capability of mainframe programming environments developed most of the functions offered by this compiler and it was withdrawn (in the 1990s?)

===DEC PL/I===
Perhaps the most commercially successful implementation aside from IBM&#x27;s was Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s VAX-11 PL/I, later known as VAX PL/I, then DEC PL/I. The implementation is &quot;a strict superset of the ANSI X3.4-1981 PL/I General Purpose Subset and provides most of the features of the new ANSI X3.74-1987 PL/I General Purpose Subset&quot;, and was first released in 1980. It originally used a compiler backend named the VAX Code Generator (VCG) created by a team led by Dave Cutler. The front end was designed by Robert Freiburghouse, and was ported to VAX/VMS from Multics. It runs on VMS on VAX and Alpha, and on Tru64. During the 1990s, Digital sold the compiler to UniPrise Systems, who later sold it to a company named Kednos. Kednos marketed the compiler as Kednos PL/I until October 2016 when the company ceased trading.

===Teaching subset compilers===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many US and Canadian universities were establishing time-sharing services on campus and needed conversational compiler/interpreters for use in teaching science, mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Dartmouth was developing BASIC, but PL/I was a popular choice, as it was concise and easy to teach. As the IBM offerings were unsuitable, a number of schools built their own subsets of PL/I and their own interactive support. Examples are:

In the 1960s and early 1970s, Allen-Babcock implemented the Remote Users of Shared Hardware (RUSH) time sharing system for an IBM System/360 Model 50 with custom microcode and subsequently implemented IBM&#x27;s CPS, an interactive time-sharing system for OS/360 aimed at teaching computer science basics, offered a limited subset of the PL/I language in addition to BASIC and a remote job entry facility.

PL/C, a dialect for teaching, a compiler developed at Cornell University, had the unusual capability of never failing to compile any program through the use of extensive automatic correction of many syntax errors and by converting any remaining syntax errors to output statements. The language was almost all of PL/I as implemented by IBM. PL/C was a very fast compiler.

 (Student Language/1, Student Language/One or Subset Language/1) was a PL/I subset, initially available late 1960s, that ran interpretively on the IBM 1130; instructional use was its strong point.

PLAGO, created at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, used a simplified subset of the PL/I language and focused on good diagnostic error messages and fast compilation times.

The Computer Systems Research Group of the University of Toronto produced the SP/k compilers which supported a sequence of subsets of PL/I called SP/1, SP/2, SP/3, ..., SP/8 for teaching programming. Programs that ran without errors under the SP/k compilers produced the same results under other contemporary PL/I compilers such as IBM&#x27;s PL/I F compiler, IBM&#x27;s checkout compiler or Cornell University&#x27;s PL/C compiler.

Other examples are PL0 by P. Grouse at the University of New South Wales, PLUM by Marvin Victor Zelkowitz at the University of Maryland., and PLUTO from the University of Toronto.

===IBM PL/I for OS/2, AIX, Linux, z/OS===
In a major revamp of PL/I, IBM Santa Teresa in California launched an entirely new compiler in 1992. The initial shipment was for OS/2 and included most ANSI-G features and many new PL/I features. Subsequent releases provided additional platforms (MVS, VM, OS/390, AIX and Windows), but as of 2021, the only supported platforms are z/OS and AIX. IBM continued to add functions to make PL/I fully competitive with other languages (particularly C and C++) in areas where it had been overtaken. The corresponding &quot;IBM Language Environment&quot; supports inter-operation of PL/I programs with Database and Transaction systems, and with programs written in C, C++, and COBOL, the compiler supports all the data types needed for intercommunication with these languages.

The PL/I design principles were retained and withstood this major extension, comprising several new data types, new statements and statement options, new exception conditions, and new organisations of program source. The resulting language is a compatible super-set of the PL/I Standard and of the earlier IBM compilers. Major topics added to PL/I were:

* New attributes for better support of user-defined data types – the codice_30, codice_31, and codice_32 statement to introduce user-defined types, the codice_33 locator data type, the codice_34 data type itself, the codice_35 data type, and built-in functions for manipulating the new types.
* Additional data types and attributes corresponding to common PC data types (e.g. codice_36, codice_37).
* Improvements in readability of programs – often rendering implied usages explicit (e.g. codice_38 attribute for parameters)
* Additional structured programming constructs.
* Interrupt handling additions.
* Compile time preprocessor extended to offer almost all PL/I string handling features and to interface with the Application Development Environment

The latest series of PL/I compilers for z/OS, called Enterprise PL/I for z/OS, leverage code generation for the latest z/Architecture processors (z14, z13, zEC12, zBC12, z196, z114) via the use of ARCHLVL parm control passed during compilation, and was the second High level language supported by z/OS Language Environment to do so (XL C/C++ being the first, and Enterprise COBOL v5 the last.)

====Data types====
 is a new computational data type. The ordinal facilities are like those in Pascal,
e.g. 
but in addition the name and internal values are accessible via built-in functions. Built-in functions provide access to an ordinal value&#x27;s predecessor and successor.

The -statement (see below) allows additional s to be declared composed from PL/I&#x27;s built-in attributes.

The codice_39 locator data type is similar to the data type, but strongly typed to bind only to a particular data structure. The codice_40 operator is used to select a data structure using a handle.

The attribute (equivalent to in early PL/I specifications) permits several scalar variables, arrays, or structures to share the same storage in a unit that occupies the amount of storage needed for the largest alternative.

====Competitiveness on PC and with C====
These attributes were added:

* The string attributes codice_37 (for zero-terminated character strings), codice_42, codice_43, and codice_44.
* The optional arithmetic attributes codice_36 and codice_46, codice_47 and codice_48. codice_36 necessitated the codice_50 and codice_51 option on iterative groups enabling a counter-controlled loop to be executed without exceeding the limit value (also essential for codice_31s and good for documenting loops).
* The codice_53 attribute for controlling date representations and additions to bring time and date to best current practice. New functions for manipulating dates include codice_54 and codice_55 for converting between dates and number of days, and a general codice_56 function for changing date formats.
New string-handling functions were added to centre text, to edit using a picture format, and to trim blanks or selected characters from the head or tail of text, codice_57 to codice_58 from the right. and codice_59 and codice_60 functions.

Compound assignment operators a la C e.g. codice_61, codice_62, codice_63, codice_64 were added. codice_65 is equivalent to codice_66.

Additional parameter descriptors and attributes were added for omitted arguments and variable length argument lists.

====Program readability – making intentions explicit====
The attribute declares an identifier as a constant (derived from a specific literal value or restricted expression).

Parameters can have the (pass by address) or (pass by value) attributes.

The and attributes prevent unintended assignments.

codice_67 obviates the need for the contrived construct .

The -statement introduces user-specified names (e.g. ) for combinations of built-in attributes (e.g. codice_68). Thus codice_69 creates the name as an alias for the set of built-in attributes FIXED BINARY(31.0). codice_32 applies to structures and their members; it provides a name for a set of structure attributes and corresponding substructure member declarations for use in a structure declaration (a generalisation of the attribute).

====Structured programming additions====
A statement to exit a loop, and an to continue with the next iteration of a loop.

 and options on iterative groups.

The package construct consisting of a set of procedures and declarations for use as a unit. Variables declared outside of the procedures are local to the package, and can use , or storage. Procedure names used in the package also are local, but can be made external by means of the option of the -statement.

====Interrupt handling====
The -statement executed in an ON-unit terminates execution of the ON-unit, and raises the condition again in the procedure that called the current one (thus passing control to the corresponding ON-unit for that procedure).

The condition handles invalid operation codes detected by the PC processor, as well as illegal arithmetic operations such as subtraction of two infinite values.

The condition is provided to intercept conditions for which no specific ON-unit has been provided in the current procedure.

The condition is raised when an statement is unable to obtain sufficient storage.

===Other mainframe and minicomputer compilers===
A number of vendors produced compilers to compete with IBM PL/I F or Optimizing compiler on mainframes and minicomputers in the 1970s. In the 1980s the target was usually the emerging ANSI-G subset.

* In 1974 Burroughs Corporation announced PL/I for the B6700 and B7700.
* UNIVAC released a UNIVAC PL/I, and in the 1970s also used a variant of PL/I, PL/I PLUS, for system programming.
* From 1978 Data General provided PL/I on its Eclipse and Eclipse MV platforms running the AOS, AOS/VS &amp; AOS/VS II operating systems. A number of operating system utility programs were written in the language.
* Paul Abrahams of NYU&#x27;s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences wrote CIMS PL/I in 1972 in PL/I, bootstrapping via PL/I F. It supported &quot;about 70%&quot; of PL/I compiling to the CDC 6600
* CDC delivered an optimizing subset PL/I compiler for Cyber 70, 170 and 6000 series.
* Fujitsu delivered a PL/I compiler equivalent to the PL/I Optimizer.
* Stratus Technologies PL/I is an ANSI G implementation for the VOS operating system.
* IBM Series/1 PL/I is an extended subset of ANSI Programming Language PL/I (ANSI X3.53-1976) for the IBM Series/1 Realtime Programming System.

===PL/I compilers for Microsoft .NET===
* In 2011, Raincode designed a full legacy compiler for the Microsoft .NET and .NET Core platforms, named The Raincode PL/I compiler.

===PL/I compilers for personal computers and Unix===
* In the 1970s and 1980s Digital Research sold a PL/I compiler for CP/M (PL/I-80), CP/M-86 (PL/I-86) and Personal Computers with DOS. It was based on Subset G of PL/I and was written in PL/M.
* Micro Focus implemented Open PL/I for Windows and UNIX/Linux systems, which they acquired from Liant.
* IBM delivered PL/I for OS/2 in 1994, and PL/I for AIX in 1995.
* Iron Spring PL/I for OS/2 and later Linux was introduced in 2007.

==PL/I dialects==
* PL/S, a dialect of PL/I, initially called BSL was developed in the late 1960s and became the system programming language for IBM mainframes. Almost all IBM mainframe system software in the 1970s and 1980s was written in PL/S. It differed from PL/I in that there were no data type conversions, no run-time environment, structures were mapped differently, and assignment was a byte by byte copy. All strings and arrays had fixed extents, or used the codice_71 option. PL/S was succeeded by PL/AS, and then by PL/X, which is the language currently used for internal work on current operating systems, OS/390 and now z/OS. It is also used for some z/VSE and z/VM components. IBM Db2 for z/OS is also written in PL/X.
* PL/C, is an instructional dialect of the PL/I computer programming language, developed at Cornell University in the 1970s.
* Two dialects of PL/I named PL/MP (Machine Product) and PL/MI (Machine Interface) were used by IBM in the system software of the System/38 and AS/400 platforms. PL/MP was used to implement the so-called Vertical Microcode of these platforms, and targeted the IMPI instruction set. PL/MI targets the Machine Interface of those platforms, and is used in the System/38 Control Program Facility, and the XPF layer of OS/400. The PL/MP code was mostly replaced with C++ when OS/400 was ported to the IBM RS64 processor family, although some was retained and retargeted for the PowerPC/Power ISA architecture. The PL/MI code was not replaced, and remains in use in IBM i.
* PL.8, so-called because it was about 80% of PL/I, was originally developed by IBM Research in the 1970s for the IBM 801 architecture. It later gained support for the Motorola 68000 and System/370 architectures. It continues to be used for several IBM internal systems development tasks (e.g. millicode and firmware for z/Architecture systems) and has been re-engineered to use a 64-bit gcc-based backend.
* Honeywell, Inc. developed PL-6 for use in creating the CP-6 operating system.
* Prime Computer used two different PL/I dialects as the system programming language of the PRIMOS operating system: PL/P, starting from version 18, and then SPL, starting from version 19.
* XPL is a dialect of PL/I used to write other compilers using the XPL compiler techniques. XPL added a heap string datatype to its small subset of PL/I.
* HAL/S is a real-time aerospace programming language, best known for its use in the Space Shuttle program. It was designed by Intermetrics in the 1970s for NASA. HAL/S was implemented in XPL.
* IBM and various subcontractors also developed another PL/I variant in the early 1970s to support signal processing for the Navy called SPL/I.
* SabreTalk, a real-time dialect of PL/I used to program the Sabre airline reservation system.
* Apple, a PL/I dialect developed by General Motors Research Laboratories for their Control Data Corporation STAR-100 supercomputer, used extensively for graphic design.

==Usage==
PL/I implementations were developed for mainframes from the late 1960s, mini computers in the 1970s, and personal computers in the 1980s and 1990s. Although its main use has been on mainframes, there are PL/I versions for DOS, Microsoft Windows, OS/2, AIX, OpenVMS, and Unix.

It has been widely used in business data processing and for system use for writing operating systems on certain platforms. Very complex and powerful systems have been built with PL/I:

* The SAS System was initially written in PL/I; the SAS data step is still modeled on PL/I syntax.
* The pioneering online airline reservation system Sabre was originally written for the IBM 7090 in assembler. The S/360 version was largely written using SabreTalk, a purpose-built subset PL/I compiler for a dedicated control program.
* The Multics operating system was largely written in PL/I.
* PL/I was used to write an executable formal definition to interpret IBM&#x27;s System Network Architecture.
* Some components of the OpenVMS operating system were originally written in PL/I, but were later rewritten in C during the port of VMS to the IA64 architecture.

PL/I did not fulfill its supporters&#x27; hopes that it would displace Fortran and COBOL and become the major player on mainframes. It remained a minority but significant player. There cannot be a definitive explanation for this, but some trends in the 1970s and 1980s militated against its success by progressively reducing the territory on which PL/I enjoyed a competitive advantage.

First, the nature of the mainframe software environment changed. Application subsystems for database and transaction processing (CICS and IMS and Oracle on System 370) and application generators became the focus of mainframe users&#x27; application development. Significant parts of the language became irrelevant because of the need to use the corresponding native features of the subsystems (such as tasking and much of input/output). Fortran was not used in these application areas, confining PL/I to COBOL&#x27;s territory; most users stayed with COBOL. But as the PC became the dominant environment for program development, Fortran, COBOL and PL/I all became minority languages overtaken by C++, Java and the like.

Second, PL/I was overtaken in the system programming field. The IBM system programming community was not ready to use PL/I; instead, IBM developed and adopted a proprietary dialect of PL/I for system programming. – PL/S. With the success of PL/S inside IBM, and of C outside IBM, the unique PL/I strengths for system programming became less valuable.

Third, the development environments grew capabilities for interactive software development that, again, made the unique PL/I interactive and debugging strengths less valuable.

Fourth, features such as structured programming, character string operations, and object orientation were added to COBOL and Fortran, which further reduced PL/I&#x27;s relative advantages.

On mainframes there were substantial business issues at stake too. IBM&#x27;s hardware competitors had little to gain and much to lose from success of PL/I. Compiler development was expensive, and the IBM compiler groups had an in-built competitive advantage. Many IBM users wished to avoid being locked into proprietary solutions. With no early support for PL/I by other vendors it was best to avoid PL/I.

==Evolution of the PL/I language==
This article uses the PL/I standard as the reference point for language features. But a number of features of significance in the early implementations were not in the Standard; and some were offered by non-IBM compilers. And the de facto language continued to grow after the standard, ultimately driven by developments on the Personal Computer.

===Significant features omitted from the standard===

====Multithreading====
Multithreading, under the name &quot;multitasking&quot;, was implemented by PL/I F, the PL/I Checkout and Optimizing compilers, and the newer AIX and Z/OS compilers. It comprised the data types and , the -option on the -statement (Fork), the -statement (Join), the codice_72, -options on the record I/O statements and the statement to unlock locked records on files. Event data identify a particular event and indicate whether it is complete (&#x27;1&#x27;B) or incomplete (&#x27;0&#x27;B): task data items identify a particular task (or process) and indicate its priority relative to other tasks.

====Preprocessor====

The first IBM &quot;Compile time preprocessor&quot; was built by the IBM Boston Advanced Programming Center located in Cambridge, Mass, and shipped with the PL/I F compiler. The codice_5 statement was in the Standard, but the rest of the features were not. The DEC and Kednos PL/I compilers implemented much the same set of features as IBM, with some additions of their own. IBM has continued to add preprocessor features to its compilers. The preprocessor treats the written source program as a sequence of tokens, copying them to an output source file or acting on them. When a % token is encountered the following compile time statement is executed: when an identifier token is encountered and the identifier has been d, d, and assigned a compile time value, the identifier is replaced by this value. Tokens are added to the output stream if they do not require action (e.g. codice_74), as are the values of ACTIVATEd compile time expressions. Thus a compile time variable could be declared, activated, and assigned using codice_75. Subsequent occurrences of would be replaced by codice_76.

The data type supported are codice_77 integers and strings of varying length with no maximum length. The structure statements are:
* codice_78
and the simple statements, which also may have a 
* and 
* &quot;assignment&quot; statement
* codice_79
* codice_80
* codice_5
* &quot;null&quot; statement

The feature allowed programmers to use identifiers for constants e.g. product part numbers or mathematical constants and was superseded in the standard by named constants for computational data. Conditional compiling and iterative generation of source code, possible with compile-time facilities, was not supported by the standard. Several manufacturers implemented these facilities.

====Structured programming additions====
Structured programming additions were made to PL/I during standardization but were not accepted into the standard. These features were the -statement to exit from an iterative , the -option and -option added to , and a case statement of the general form:

These features were all included in IBM&#x27;s PL/I Checkout and Optimizing compilers and in DEC PL/I.

====Debug facilities====
PL/I F had offered some debug facilities that were not put forward for the standard but were implemented by others notably the CHECK(variable-list) condition prefix, codice_82 on-condition and the codice_83 option. The IBM Optimizing and Checkout compilers added additional features appropriate to the conversational mainframe programming environment (e.g. an codice_84 condition).

===Significant features developed since the standard===
Several attempts had been made to design a structure member type that could have one of several datatypes (codice_85 in early IBM). With the growth of classes in programming theory, approaches to this became possible on a PL/I base codice_35, codice_34 etc. have been added by several compilers.

PL/I had been conceived in a single-byte character world. With support for Japanese and Chinese language becoming essential, and the developments on International Code Pages, the character string concept was expanded to accommodate wide non-ASCII/EBCDIC strings.

Time and date handling were overhauled to deal with the millennium problem, with the introduction of the DATETIME function that returned the date and time in one of about 35 different formats. Several other date functions deal with conversions to and from days and seconds.

==Criticisms==

===Implementation issues===
Though the language is easy to learn and use, implementing a PL/I compiler is difficult and time-consuming. A language as large as PL/I needed subsets that most vendors could produce and most users master. This was not resolved until &quot;ANSI G&quot; was published. The compile time facilities, unique to PL/I, took added implementation effort and additional compiler passes. A PL/I compiler was two to four times as large as comparable Fortran or COBOL compilers, and also that much slower—supposedly offset by gains in programmer productivity. This was anticipated in IBM before the first compilers were written.

Some argue that PL/I is unusually hard to parse. The PL/I &quot;keywords&quot; are not reserved so programmers can use them as variable or procedure names in programs. Because the original PL/I(F) compiler attempts &quot;auto-correction&quot; when it encounters a keyword used in an incorrect context, it often assumes it is a variable name. This leads to &quot;cascading diagnostics&quot;, a problem solved by later compilers.

The effort needed to produce good object code was perhaps underestimated during the initial design of the language. Program optimization (needed to compete with the excellent program optimization carried out by available Fortran compilers) is unusually complex owing to side effects and pervasive problems with aliasing of variables. Unpredictable modification can occur asynchronously in exception handlers, which may be provided by &quot; statements&quot; in (unseen) callers. Together, these make it difficult to reliably predict when a program&#x27;s variables might be modified at runtime. In typical use, however, user-written error handlers (the -unit) often do not make assignments to variables. In spite of the aforementioned difficulties, IBM produced the PL/I Optimizing Compiler in 1971.

PL/I contains many rarely used features, such as multitasking support (an IBM extension to the language) which add cost and complexity to the compiler, and its co-processing facilities require a multi-programming environment with support for non-blocking multiple threads for processes by the operating system. Compiler writers were free to select whether to implement these features.

An undeclared variable is, by default, declared by first occurrence—thus misspelling might lead to unpredictable results. This &quot;implicit declaration&quot; is no different from FORTRAN programs. For PL/I(F), however, an attribute listing enables the programmer to detect any misspelled or undeclared variable.

===Programmer issues===
Many programmers were slow to move from COBOL or Fortran due to a perceived complexity of the language and immaturity of the PL/I F compiler. Programmers were sharply divided into scientific programmers (who used Fortran) and business programmers (who used COBOL), with significant tension and even dislike between the groups. PL/I syntax borrowed from both COBOL and Fortran syntax. So instead of noticing features that would make their job easier, Fortran programmers of the time noticed COBOL syntax and had the opinion that it was a business language, while COBOL programmers noticed Fortran syntax and looked upon it as a scientific language.

Both COBOL and Fortran programmers viewed it as a &quot;bigger&quot; version of their own language, and both were somewhat intimidated by the language and disinclined to adopt it. Another factor was &quot;pseudo&quot;-similarities to COBOL, Fortran, and ALGOL. These were PL/I elements that looked similar to one of those languages, but worked differently in PL/I. Such frustrations left many experienced programmers with a jaundiced view of PL/I, and often an active dislike for the language. An early UNIX fortune file contained the following tongue-in-cheek description of the language:

Speaking as someone who has delved into the intricacies of PL/I, I am sure that only Real Men could have written such a machine-hogging, cycle-grabbing, all-encompassing monster. Allocate an array and free the middle third? Sure! Why not? Multiply a character string times a bit string and assign the result to a float decimal? Go ahead! Free a controlled variable procedure parameter and reallocate it before passing it back? Overlay three different types of variable on the same memory location? Anything you say! Write a recursive macro? Well, no, but Real Men use rescan. How could a language so obviously designed and written by Real Men not be intended for Real Man use?

On the positive side, full support for pointers to all data types (including pointers to structures), recursion, multitasking, string handling, and extensive built-in functions meant PL/I was indeed quite a leap forward compared to the programming languages of its time. However, these were not enough to persuade a majority of programmers or shops to switch to PL/I.

The PL/I F compiler&#x27;s compile time preprocessor was unusual (outside the Lisp world) in using its target language&#x27;s syntax and semantics (&quot;e.g.&quot; as compared to the C preprocessor&#x27;s &quot;#&quot; directives).

==Special topics in PL/I==

===Storage classes===
PL/I provides several &#x27;storage classes&#x27; to indicate how the lifetime of variables&#x27; storage is to be managed codice_88, codice_89, codice_90, and codice_91, and codice_23.

codice_88 data is allocated and initialized at load-time, as is done in COBOL &quot;working-storage&quot; and early Fortran. This is the default for codice_22 variables (similar to C “extern” or Fortran “named common&quot;),

codice_89 is PL/I&#x27;s default storage class for codice_96 variables, similar to that of other block-structured languages influenced by ALGOL, like the &quot;auto&quot; storage class in the C language, the default storage allocation in Pascal, and &quot;local-storage&quot; in IBM COBOL. Storage for codice_89 variables is allocated upon entry into the procedure, codice_98-block, or codice_99-unit in which they are declared. The compiler and runtime system allocate memory for a stack frame to contain them and other housekeeping information. If a variable is declared with an codice_100-attribute, code to set it to an initial value is executed at this time. Care is required to manage the use of initialization properly. Large amounts of code can be executed to initialize variables every time a scope is entered, especially if the variable is an array or structure. Storage for codice_89 variables is freed at block exit.

codice_88, codice_90, or codice_91 variables are used to retain variables&#x27; contents between invocations of a procedure or block. 

codice_90 storage is managed using a stack, but the pushing and popping of allocations on the stack is managed by the programmer, using codice_106 and codice_107 statements.

Storage for codice_91 variables is also managed using codice_106/codice_107, but instead of a stack these allocations have independent lifetimes and are addressed through codice_111 or codice_112 variables. codice_91 variables can also be used to address arbitrary storage areas by setting the associated codice_112 variable, for example following a linked list.

The codice_23 attribute is used to declare programmer-defined heaps. Data can be allocated and freed within a specific area, and the area can be deleted, read, and written as a unit.

===Storage type sharing===
There are several ways of accessing allocated storage through different data declarations. Some of these are well defined and safe, some can be used safely with careful programming, and some are inherently unsafe or machine dependent.

Passing a variable as an argument to a parameter by reference allows the argument&#x27;s allocated storage to be referenced using the parameter. The attribute (e.g. codice_116) allows part or all of a variable&#x27;s storage to be used with a different, but consistent, declaration. The language definition includes a attribute (later renamed ) to allow different definitions of data to share the same storage. This was not supported by many early IBM compilers. These usages are safe and machine independent.

Record I/O and list processing produce situations where the programmer needs to fit a declaration to the storage of the next record or item, before knowing what type of data structure it has. Based variables and pointers are key to such programs. The data structures must be designed appropriately, typically using fields in a data structure to encode information about its type and size. The fields can be held in the preceding structure or, with some constraints, in the current one. Where the encoding is in the preceding structure, the program needs to allocate a based variable with a declaration that matches the current item (using expressions for extents where needed). Where the type and size information are to be kept in the current structure (&quot;self defining structures&quot;) the type-defining fields must be ahead of the type dependent items and in the same place in every version of the data structure. The -option is used for self-defining extents (e.g. string lengths as in codice_117, etc where is used to allocate instances of the data structure. For self-defining structures, any typing and ed fields are placed ahead of the &quot;real&quot; data. If the records in a data set, or the items in a list of data structures, are organised this way they can be handled safely in a machine independent way.

PL/I implementations do not (except for the PL/I Checkout compiler) keep track of the data structure used when storage is first allocated. Any declaration can be used with a pointer into the storage to access the storage inherently unsafe and machine dependent. However, this usage has become important for &quot;pointer arithmetic&quot; (typically adding a certain amount to a known address). This has been a contentious subject in computer science. In addition to the problem of wild references and buffer overruns, issues arise due to the alignment and length for data types used with particular machines and compilers. Many cases where pointer arithmetic might be needed involve finding a pointer to an element inside a larger data structure. The function computes such pointers, safely and machine independently.

Pointer arithmetic may be accomplished by aliasing a binary variable with a pointer as in

It relies on pointers being the same length as codice_118 integers and aligned on the same boundaries.

With the prevalence of C and its free and easy attitude to pointer arithmetic, recent IBM PL/I compilers allow pointers to be used with the addition and subtraction operators to giving the simplest syntax (but compiler options can disallow these practices where safety and machine independence are paramount).

===ON-units and exception handling===
When PL/I was designed, programs only ran in batch mode, with no possible intervention from the programmer at a terminal. An exceptional condition such as division by zero would abort the program yielding only a hexadecimal core dump. PL/I exception handling, via -units, allowed the program to stay in control in the face of hardware or operating system exceptions and to recover debugging information before closing down more gracefully. As a program became properly debugged, most of the exception handling could be removed or disabled: this level of control became less important when conversational execution became commonplace.

Computational exception handling is enabled and disabled by condition prefixes on statements, blocks (including -units) and procedures. – e.g. codice_119. Operating system exceptions for Input/Output and storage management are always enabled.

The -unit is a single statement or -block introduced by an -statement. Executing the statement enables the condition specified, e.g., codice_120-unit. When the exception for this condition occurs and the condition is enabled, the -unit for the condition is executed. -units are inherited down the call chain. When a block, procedure or -unit is activated, the -units established by the invoking activation are inherited by the new activation. They may be over-ridden by another -statement and can be reestablished by the -statement. The exception can be simulated using the -statement – e.g. to help debug the exception handlers. The dynamic inheritance principle for -units allows a routine to handle the exceptions occurring within the subroutines it uses.

If no -unit is in effect when a condition is raised a standard system action is taken (often this is to raise the condition). The system action can be reestablished using the option of the -statement. With some conditions it is possible to complete executing an ON-unit and return to the point of interrupt (e.g., the , , , , , and conditions) and resume normal execution. With other conditions such as codice_121, the condition is raised when this is attempted. An ON-unit may be terminated with a codice_122 preventing a return to the point of interrupt, but permitting the program to continue execution elsewhere as determined by the programmer.

An -unit needs to be designed to deal with exceptions that occur in the -unit itself. The codice_123 statement allows a nested error trap; if an error occurs within an -unit, control might pass to the operating system where a system dump might be produced, or, for some computational conditions, continue execution (as mentioned above).

The PL/I I/O statements have relatively simple syntax as they do not offer options for the many situations from end-of-file to record transmission errors that can occur when a record is read or written. Instead, these complexities are handled in the -units for the various file conditions. The same approach was adopted for sub-allocation and the condition.

The existence of exception handling -units can have an effect on optimization, because variables can be inspected or altered in -units. Values of variables that might otherwise be kept in registers between statements, may need to be returned to storage between statements. This is discussed in the section on Implementation Issues above.

===GO TO with a non-fixed target===
PL/I has counterparts for COBOL and FORTRAN&#x27;s specialized GO TO statements.

Syntax for both COBOL and FORTRAN exist for coding two special two types of , each of which has a target that is not always the same.
* (COBOL), (FORTRAN):
** (“altered go to”).
**: There are other/helpful restrictions on these, especially &quot;in programs ... attribute, in methods, or .. option.&quot;
** (“assigned go to”)
**: One enhancement, which adds built-in documentation, is
**:: (which restricts the variable&#x27;s value to &quot;one of the labels in the list.&quot;)
* ... based on a variable&#x27;s subscript-like value.
** (“computed go to”)
** (“go to depending on”).

PL/I has statement label variables (with the attribute), which can store the value of a statement label, and later be used in a statement.
The programmer can also create an array of static label constants by subscripting the statement labels.
 GO TO HERE(LUCKY_NUMBER); /* minus 1, zero, or ... */

 HERE(-1): PUT LIST (&quot;I O U&quot;); GO TO Lottery;
 HERE(0): PUT LIST (&quot;No Cash&quot;); GO TO Lottery;
 HERE(1): PUT LIST (&quot;Dollar Bill&quot;); GO TO Lottery;
 HERE(2): PUT LIST (&quot;TWO DOLLARS&quot;); GO TO Lottery;

Statement label variables can be passed to called procedures, and used to return to a different statement in the calling routine.

==Sample programs==

===Hello world program===

Hello2: proc options(main);
 put list (&#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;);
end Hello2;
===Search for a string===

/* Read in a line, which contains a string,
/* and then print every subsequent line that contains that string. */

find_strings: procedure options (main);
 declare pattern character (100) varying;
 declare line character (100) varying;
 declare line_no fixed binary;

 on endfile (sysin) stop;

 get edit (pattern) (L);
 line_no = 1;
 do forever;
 get edit (line) (L);
 if index(line, pattern) &gt; 0 then
 put skip list (line_no, line);
 line_no = line_no + 1;
 end;

end find_strings;

<text>Punctuation marks are marks indicating how a piece of written text should be read (silently or aloud) and, consequently, understood. The oldest known examples of punctuation marks were found in the Mesha Stele from the 9th century BC, consisting of points between the words and horizontal strokes between sections. The alphabet-based writing began with no spaces, no capitalization, no vowels (see abjad), and with only a few punctuation marks, as it was mostly aimed at recording business transactions. Only with the Greek playwrights (such as Euripides and Aristophanes) did the ends of sentences begin to be marked to help actors know when to make a pause during performances. Punctuation includes space between words and both obsolete and modern signs.

By the 19th century, the punctuation marks were used hierarchically, according to their weight. Six marks, proposed in 1966 by the French author Hervé Bazin, could be seen as predecessors of emoticons and emojis. 

In rare cases, the meaning of a text can be changed substantially by using different punctuation, such as in &quot;woman, without her man, is nothing&quot; (emphasizing the importance of men to women), contrasted with &quot;woman: without her, man is nothing&quot; (emphasizing the importance of women to men). Similar changes in meaning can be achieved in spoken forms of most languages by using elements of speech such as suprasegmentals. The rules of punctuation vary with the language, location, register, and time. In online chat and text messages punctuation is used tachygraphically, especially among younger users.

==History==
Punctuation marks, especially spacing, were not needed in logographic or syllabic (such as Chinese and Mayan script) texts because disambiguation and emphasis could be communicated by employing a separate written form distinct from the spoken form of the language. Ancient Chinese classical texts were transmitted without punctuation. However, many Warring States period bamboo texts contain the symbols and indicating the end of a chapter and full stop, respectively. By the Song dynasty, the addition of punctuation to texts by scholars to aid comprehension became common.

===Western antiquity===
During antiquity, most scribes in the West wrote in , i.e. without punctuation delimiting word boundaries. Around the 5th century BC, the Greeks began using punctuation consisting of vertically arranged dots—usually a dicolon or tricolon—as an aid in the oral delivery of texts. After 200 BC, Greek scribes adopted the system invented by Aristophanes of Byzantium, where a single dot called a was placed at one of several heights to denote rhetorical divisions in speech:
* a low on the baseline to mark off a (a unit smaller than a clause)
* a at midheight to mark off a clause ()
* a high to mark off a sentence ()
In addition, the Greeks used the paragraphos (or gamma) to mark the beginning of sentences, marginal diples to mark quotations, and a koronis to indicate the end of major sections.

During the 1st century BC, Romans also made occasional use of symbols to indicate pauses, but by the 4th century AD the Greek —called in Latin—prevailed, as reported by Aelius Donatus and Isidore of Seville (7th century). Latin texts were sometimes laid out , where each sentence was placed on its own line. Diples were used, but by the late period these often degenerated into comma-shaped marks.

===Medieval===
Punctuation developed dramatically when large numbers of copies of the Bible started to be produced. These were designed to be read aloud, so the copyists began to introduce a range of marks to aid the reader, including indentation, various punctuation marks (diple, , ), and an early version of initial capitals (). Jerome and his colleagues, who made a translation of the Bible into Latin, the Vulgate (), employed a layout system based on established practices for teaching the speeches of Demosthenes and Cicero. Under his layout every sense-unit was indented and given its own line. This layout was solely used for biblical manuscripts during the 5th–9th centuries but was abandoned in favor of punctuation.

In the 7th–8th centuries Irish and Anglo-Saxon scribes, whose native languages were not derived from Latin, added more visual cues to render texts more intelligible. Irish scribes introduced the practice of word separation. Likewise, insular scribes adopted the system while adapting it for minuscule script (so as to be more prominent) by using not differing height but rather a differing number of marks—aligned horizontally (or sometimes triangularly)—to signify a pause&#x27;s duration: one mark for a minor pause, two for a medium one, and three for a major one. Most common were the , a comma-shaped mark, and a 7-shaped mark (), often used in combination. The same marks could be used in the margin to mark off quotations.

In the late 8th century a different system emerged in France under the Carolingian dynasty. Originally indicating how the voice should be modulated when chanting the liturgy, the migrated into any text meant to be read aloud, and then to all manuscripts. first reached England in the late 10th century, probably during the Benedictine reform movement, but was not adopted until after the Norman conquest. The original were the , , , and , but a fifth symbol, the , was added in the 10th century to indicate a pause of a value between the and . In the late 11th/early 12th century the disappeared and was taken over by the simple (now with two distinct values).

The late Middle Ages saw the addition of the (slash or slash with a midpoint dot) which was often used in conjunction with the for different types of pauses. Direct quotations were marked with marginal diples, as in Antiquity, but from at least the 12th century scribes also began entering diples (sometimes double) within the column of text.

===Printing-press era===

The amount of printed material and its readership began to increase after the invention of moveable type in Europe in the 1450s. Martin Luther&#x27;s German Bible translation was one of the first mass printed works, he used only virgule, full stop and less than one percent question marks as punctuation. The focus of punctuation still was rhetorical, to aid reading aloud. As explained by writer and editor Lynne Truss, &quot;The rise of printing in the 14th and 15th centuries meant that a standard system of punctuation was urgently required.&quot; Printed books, whose letters were uniform, could be read much more rapidly than manuscripts. Rapid reading, or reading aloud, did not allow time to analyze sentence structures. This increased speed led to the greater use and finally standardization of punctuation, which showed the relationships of words with each other: where one sentence ends and another begins, for example.

The introduction of a standard system of punctuation has also been attributed to the Venetian printers Aldus Manutius and his grandson. They have been credited with popularizing the practice of ending sentences with the colon or full stop (period), inventing the semicolon, making occasional use of parentheses, and creating the modern comma by lowering the virgule. By 1566, Aldus Manutius the Younger was able to state that the main object of punctuation was the clarification of syntax.

By the 19th century, punctuation in the Western world had evolved &quot;to classify the marks hierarchically, in terms of weight&quot;. Cecil Hartley&#x27;s poem identifies their relative values:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin:1.2em 0 1.5em 3em;&quot;&gt;
The stop point out, with truth, the time of pause
A sentence doth require at ev&#x27;ry clause.
At ev&#x27;ry comma, stop while &quot;one&quot; you count;
At semicolon, &quot;two&quot; is the amount;
A colon doth require the time of &quot;three&quot;;
The period &quot;four&quot;, as learned men agree.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The use of punctuation was not standardised until after the invention of printing. According to the 1885 edition of &quot;The American Printer&quot;, the importance of punctuation was noted in various sayings by children, such as:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin:1.2em 0 1.5em 3em;&quot;&gt;
Charles the First walked and talked
Half an hour after his head was cut off.
&lt;/poem&gt;
With a semicolon and a comma added, it reads as follows:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin:1.2em 0 1.5em 3em;&quot;&gt;
Charles the First walked and talked;
Half an hour after, his head was cut off.
&lt;/poem&gt;
In a 19th-century manual of typography, Thomas MacKellar writes:
===Typewriters and electronic communication===
The introduction of electrical telegraphy with a limited set of transmission codes and typewriters with a limited set of keys influenced punctuation subtly. For example, curved quotes and apostrophes were all collapsed into two characters (&#x27; and &quot;). The hyphen, minus sign, and dashes of various widths have been collapsed into a single character (-), sometimes repeated to represent a long dash. The spaces of different widths available to professional typesetters were generally replaced by a single full-character width space, with typefaces monospaced. In some cases a typewriter keyboard did not include an exclamation point (!), which could otherwise be constructed by the overstrike of an apostrophe and a period; the original Morse code did not have an exclamation point.

These simplifications have been carried forward into digital writing, with teleprinters and the ASCII character set essentially supporting the same characters as typewriters. Treatment of whitespace in HTML discouraged the practice (in English prose) of putting two full spaces after a full stop, since a single or double space would appear the same on the screen. (Most style guides now discourage double spaces, and some electronic writing tools, including Wikipedia&#x27;s software, automatically collapse double spaces to single.) The full traditional set of typesetting tools became available with the advent of desktop publishing and more sophisticated word processors. Despite the widespread adoption of character sets like Unicode that support the punctuation of traditional typesetting, writing forms like text messages tend to use the simplified ASCII style of punctuation, with the addition of new non-text characters like emoji. Informal text speak tends to drop punctuation when not needed, including some ways that would be considered errors in more formal writing.

In the computer era, punctuation characters were recycled for use in programming languages and URLs. Due to its use in email and Twitter handles, the at sign (@) has gone from an obscure character mostly used by sellers of bulk commodities (10 pounds @$2.00 per pound), to a very common character in common use for both technical routing and an abbreviation for &quot;at&quot;. The tilde (~), in moveable type only used in combination with vowels, for mechanical reasons ended up as a separate key on mechanical typewriters, and like @ it has been put to completely new uses.

==In English==

There are two major styles of punctuation in English: British or American. These two styles differ mainly in the way in which they handle quotation marks, particularly in conjunction with other punctuation marks. In British English, punctuation marks such as full stops and commas are placed inside the quotation mark only if they are part of what is being quoted, and placed outside the closing quotation mark if part of the containing sentence. In American English, however, such punctuation is generally placed inside the closing quotation mark regardless. This rule varies for other punctuation marks; for example, American English follows the British English rule when it comes to semicolons, colons, question marks, and exclamation points. The serial comma is used much more often in the United States than in the UK.

==Other languages==


Other languages of Europe use much the same punctuation as English. The similarity is so strong that the few variations may confuse a native English reader. Quotation marks are particularly variable across European languages. For example, in French and Russian, quotes would appear as: (In French, the quotation marks are spaced from the enclosed material; in Russian they are not.)

In the French of France and Belgium, the marks , , and are preceded by a thin space. In Canadian French, this is only the case for .

In Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point , known as the ().

In Georgian, three dots were formerly used as a sentence or paragraph divider. It is still sometimes used in calligraphy.

Spanish and Asturian (both of them Romance languages used in Spain) use an inverted question mark at the beginning of a question and the normal question mark at the end, as well as an inverted exclamation mark at the beginning of an exclamation and the normal exclamation mark at the end.

Armenian uses several punctuation marks of its own. The full stop is represented by a colon, and vice versa; the exclamation mark is represented by a diagonal similar to a tilde , while the question mark resembles an unclosed circle placed after the last vowel of the word.

Arabic, Urdu, and Persian—written from right to left—use a reversed question mark: , and a reversed comma: . This is a modern innovation; pre-modern Arabic did not use punctuation. Hebrew, which is also written from right to left, uses the same characters as in English, and .

Originally, Sanskrit had no punctuation. In the 17th century, Sanskrit and Marathi, both written using Devanagari, started using the vertical bar to end a line of prose and double vertical bars in verse.

Punctuation was not used in Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese Chu Nom writing until the adoption of punctuation from the West in the late 19th and early 20th century. In unpunctuated texts, the grammatical structure of sentences in classical writing is inferred from context. Most punctuation marks in modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean have similar functions to their English counterparts; however, they often look different and have different customary rules.

In the Indian subcontinent, is sometimes used in place of colon or after a subheading. Its origin is unclear, but could be a remnant of the British Raj. Another punctuation common in the Indian Subcontinent for writing monetary amounts is the use of or after the number. For example, Rs. 20/- or Rs. 20/= implies 20 whole rupees.

Thai, Khmer, Lao and Burmese did not use punctuation until the adoption of punctuation from the West in the 20th century. Blank spaces are more frequent than full stops or commas.

==Novel punctuation marks==
===Interrobang===

In 1962, American advertising executive Martin K. Speckter proposed the interrobang (‽), a combination of the question mark and exclamation point, to mark rhetorical questions or questions stated in a tone of disbelief. Although the new punctuation mark was widely discussed in the 1960s, it failed to achieve widespread use. Nevertheless, both it and its inverted form were given code points in Unicode: , .

===Predecessors of emoticons and emojis===
The six additional punctuation marks proposed in 1966 by the French author Hervé Bazin in his book (&quot;Let&#x27;s pluck the bird&quot;, 1966) could be seen as predecessors of emoticons and emojis.

These were:
* the &quot;irony point&quot; or &quot;irony mark&quot; (: )
* the &quot;love point&quot; (: ) 
* the &quot;conviction point&quot; (: ) 
* the &quot;authority point&quot; (: )
* the &quot;acclamation point&quot; (: )
* the &quot;doubt point&quot; (: )

===&quot;Question comma&quot;, &quot;exclamation comma&quot;===

An international patent application was filed, and published in 1992 under World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) number WO9219458, for two new punctuation marks: the &quot;question comma&quot; and the &quot;exclamation comma&quot;. The &quot;question comma&quot; has a comma instead of the dot at the bottom of a question mark, while the &quot;exclamation comma&quot; has a comma in place of the point at the bottom of an exclamation mark. These were intended for use as question and exclamation marks within a sentence, a function for which normal question and exclamation marks can also be used, but which may be considered obsolescent. The patent application entered into the national phase only in Canada. It was advertised as lapsing in Australia on 27 January 1994 and in Canada on 6 November 1995.

===Others===
Other proposed punctuation marks include:
* Snark mark, indicating an ironic statement by putting a tilde next to terminal punctuation: for dry sarcasm, for enthusiastic sarcasm, and for sarcastic questions
* Rhetorical question mark: 
* SarcMark for sarcasm

<text>A pentomino (or 5-omino) is a polyomino of order 5; that is, a polygon in the plane made of 5 equal-sized squares connected edge to edge. The term is derived from the Greek word for &#x27;5&#x27; and &quot;domino&quot;. When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, there are 12 different &quot;free&quot; pentominoes. When reflections are considered distinct, there are 18 &quot;one-sided&quot; pentominoes. When rotations are also considered distinct, there are 63 &quot;fixed&quot; pentominoes.

Pentomino tiling puzzles and games are popular in recreational mathematics. Usually, video games such as &quot;Tetris&quot; imitations and &quot;Rampart&quot; consider mirror reflections to be distinct, and thus use the full set of 18 one-sided pentominoes. (Tetris itself uses 4-square shapes.)

Each of the twelve pentominoes satisfies the Conway criterion; hence, every pentomino is capable of tiling the plane. Each chiral pentomino can tile the plane without being reflected.

==History==

The earliest puzzle containing a complete set of pentominoes appeared in Henry Dudeney&#x27;s book, The Canterbury Puzzles, published in 1907. The earliest tilings of rectangles with a complete set of pentominoes appeared in the Problemist Fairy Chess Supplement in 1935, and further tiling problems were explored in the PFCS, and its successor, the Fairy Chess Review.

Pentominoes were formally defined by American professor Solomon W. Golomb starting in 1953 and later in his 1965 book &quot;&quot;. They were introduced to the general public by Martin Gardner in his October 1965 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American. Golomb coined the term &quot;pentomino&quot; from the Ancient Greek / &quot;pénte&quot;, &quot;five&quot;, and the -omino of domino, fancifully interpreting the &quot;d-&quot; of &quot;domino&quot; as if it were a form of the Greek prefix &quot;di-&quot; (two). Golomb named the 12 &quot;free&quot; pentominoes after letters of the Latin alphabet that they resemble, using the mnemonic FILiPiNo along with the end of the alphabet (TUVWXYZ).

John Horton Conway proposed an alternate labeling scheme for pentominoes, using O instead of I, Q instead of L, R instead of F, and S instead of N. The resemblance to the letters is more strained, especially for the O pentomino, but this scheme has the advantage of using 12 consecutive letters of the alphabet. It is used by convention in discussing Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, where, for example, one speaks of the R-pentomino instead of the F-pentomino.

==Symmetry==
* F, L, N, P, and Y can be oriented in 8 ways: 4 by rotation, and 4 more for the mirror image. Their symmetry group consists only of the identity mapping.
* T, and U can be oriented in 4 ways by rotation. They have an axis of reflection aligned with the gridlines. Their symmetry group has two elements, the identity and the reflection in a line parallel to the sides of the squares.
* V and W also can be oriented in 4 ways by rotation. They have an axis of reflection symmetry at 45° to the gridlines. Their symmetry group has two elements, the identity and a diagonal reflection.
* Z can be oriented in 4 ways: 2 by rotation, and 2 more for the mirror image. It has point symmetry, also known as rotational symmetry of order 2. Its symmetry group has two elements, the identity and the 180° rotation.
* I can be oriented in 2 ways by rotation. It has two axes of reflection symmetry, both aligned with the gridlines. Its symmetry group has four elements, the identity, two reflections and the 180° rotation. It is the dihedral group of order 2, also known as the Klein four-group.
* X can be oriented in only one way. It has four axes of reflection symmetry, aligned with the gridlines and the diagonals, and rotational symmetry of order 4. Its symmetry group, the dihedral group of order 4, has eight elements.

The F, L, N, P, Y, and Z pentominoes are chiral; adding their reflections (F′, J, N′, Q, Y′, S) brings the number of &quot;one-sided&quot; pentominoes to 18. If rotations are also considered distinct, then the pentominoes from the first category count eightfold, the ones from the next three categories (T, U, V, W, Z) count fourfold, I counts twice, and X counts only once. This results in 5×8 + 5×4 + 2 + 1 = 63 &quot;fixed&quot; pentominoes.

The eight possible orientations of the F, L, N, P, and Y pentominoes, and the four possible orientations of the T, U, V, W, and Z pentominoes are illustrated:


For 2D figures in general there are two more categories:
* Being orientable in 2 ways by a rotation of 90°, with two axes of reflection symmetry, both aligned with the diagonals. This type of symmetry requires at least a heptomino.
* Being orientable in 2 ways, which are each other&#x27;s mirror images, for example a swastika. This type of symmetry requires at least an octomino.

=== Tiling puzzle (2D) ===
A standard pentomino puzzle is to tile a rectangular box with the pentominoes, i.e. cover it without overlap and without gaps. Each of the 12 pentominoes has an area of 5 unit squares, so the box must have an area of 60 units. Possible sizes are 6×10, 5×12, 4×15 and 3×20.

The 6×10 case was first solved in 1960 by married couple Colin Brian Haselgrove and Jenifer Haselgrove. There are exactly 2,339 solutions, excluding trivial variations obtained by rotation and reflection of the whole rectangle but including rotation and reflection of a subset of pentominoes (which sometimes provides an additional solution in a simple way). The 5×12 box has 1010 solutions, the 4×15 box has 368 solutions, and the 3×20 box has just 2 solutions (one is shown in the figure, and the other one can be obtained from the solution shown by rotating, as a whole, the block consisting of the L, N, F, T, W, Y, and Z pentominoes).

A somewhat easier (more symmetrical) puzzle, the 8×8 rectangle with a 2×2 hole in the center, was solved by Dana Scott as far back as 1958. There are 65 solutions. Scott&#x27;s algorithm was one of the first applications of a backtracking computer program. Variations of this puzzle allow the four holes to be placed in any position. One of the external links uses this rule.

Efficient algorithms have been described to solve such problems, for instance by Donald Knuth. Running on modern hardware, these pentomino puzzles can now be solved in mere seconds.
Most such patterns are solvable, with the exceptions of placing each pair of holes near two corners of the board in such a way that both corners could only be fitted by a P-pentomino, or forcing a T-pentomino or U-pentomino in a corner such that another hole is created.

The pentomino set is the only free polyomino set that can be packed into a rectangle, with the exception of the trivial monomino and domino sets, each of which consists only of a single rectangle.

=== Box filling puzzle (3D) ===

A pentacube is a polycube of five cubes. Of the 29 one-sided pentacubes, exactly twelve pentacubes are flat (1-layer) and correspond to the twelve pentominoes extruded to a depth of one square.

A pentacube puzzle or 3D pentomino puzzle, amounts to filling a 3-dimensional box with the 12 flat pentacubes, i.e. cover it without overlap and without gaps. Since each pentacube has a volume of 5 unit cubes, the box must have a volume of 60 units. Possible sizes are 2×3×10 (12 solutions), 2×5×6 (264 solutions) and 3×4×5 (3940 solutions).

Alternatively one could also consider combinations of five cubes that are themselves 3D, i.e., those which include more than just the 12 &quot;flat&quot; single-layer thick combinations of cubes. However, in addition to the 12 &quot;flat&quot; pentacubes formed by extruding the pentominoes, there are 6 sets of chiral pairs and 5 additional pieces, forming a total of 29 potential pentacube pieces, which gives 145 cubes in total (=29×5); as 145 can only be packed into a box measuring 29×5×1, it cannot be formed by including the non-flat pentominoes.

=== Commercial board games ===

There are board games of skill based entirely on pentominoes. Such games are often simply called &quot;Pentominoes&quot;.

One of the games is played on an 8×8 grid by two or three players. Players take turns in placing pentominoes on the board so that they do not overlap with existing tiles and no tile is used more than once. The objective is to be the last player to place a tile on the board. This version of Pentominoes is called &quot;Golomb&#x27;s Game&quot;.

The two-player version has been weakly solved in 1996 by Hilarie Orman. It was proved to be a first-player win by examining around 22 billion board positions.

Pentominoes, and similar shapes, are also the basis of a number of other tiling games, patterns and puzzles. For example, the French board game &quot;Blokus&quot; is played with 4 colored sets of polyominoes, each consisting of every pentomino (12), tetromino (5), triomino (2) domino (1) and monomino (1). Like the game &quot;Pentominoes&quot;, the goal is to use all of your tiles, and a bonus is given if the monomino is played on the last move. The player with the fewest blocks remaining wins.

The game of &quot;Cathedral&quot; is also based on polyominoes.

Parker Brothers released a multi-player pentomino board game called &quot;Universe&quot; in 1966. Its theme is based on a deleted scene from the 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; in which an astronaut is playing a two-player pentomino game against the HAL 9000 computer (a scene with a different astronaut playing chess was retained). The front of the board game box features scenes from the movie as well as a caption describing it as the &quot;game of the future&quot;. The game comes with four sets of pentominoes in red, yellow, blue, and white. The board has two playable areas: a base 10x10 area for two players with an additional 25 squares (two more rows of 10 and one offset row of five) on each side for more than two players.

Game manufacturer Lonpos has a number of games that use the same pentominoes, but on different game planes. Their &quot;101 Game&quot; has a 5 x 11 plane. By changing the shape of the plane, thousands of puzzles can be played, although only a relatively small selection of these puzzles are available in print.

=== Video games ===
* &quot;Tetris&quot; was inspired by pentomino puzzles, although it uses four-block tetrominoes. Some Tetris clones and variants, like the game &quot;5s&quot; included with Plan 9 from Bell Labs, and &quot;Magical Tetris Challenge&quot;, do use pentominoes.
* &quot;Daedalian Opus&quot; uses pentomino puzzles throughout the game.

== Literature ==
Pentominoes were featured in a prominent subplot of Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s 1975 novel &quot;Imperial Earth&quot;. Clarke also wrote an essay in which he described the game and how he got hooked on it.

They were also featured in Blue Balliett&#x27;s &quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot;, which was published in 2003 and illustrated by Brett Helquist, as well as its sequels, &quot;The Wright 3&quot; and &quot;The Calder Game&quot;.

In &quot;The New York Times&quot; crossword puzzle for June 27, 2012, the clue for an 11-letter word at 37 across was &quot;Complete set of 12 shapes formed by this puzzle&#x27;s black squares.&quot;

<text>A programmer, computer programmer or coder is an author of computer source code someone with skill in computer programming.

The professional titles &quot;software developer&quot; and &quot;software engineer&quot; are used for jobs that require a programmer.

== Identification ==

Sometimes a programmer or job position is identified by the language used or target platform. For example, assembly programmer, web developer.

== Job title ==

The job titles that include programming tasks have differing connotations across the computer industry and to different individuals. The following are notable descriptions.

A &quot;software developer&quot; primarily implements software based on specifications and fixes bugs. Other duties may include reviewing code changes and testing. 
To achieve the required skills for the job, they might obtain a computer science or associate degree, attend a programming boot camp or be self-taught.

A &quot;software engineer&quot; usually is responsible for the same tasks as a developer
plus broader responsibilities of software engineering including architecting and designing new features and applications, targeting new platforms, managing the software development lifecycle (design, implementation, testing, and deployment), leading a team of programmers, communicating with customers, managers and other engineers, considering system stability and quality, and exploring software development methodologies.

Sometimes, a software engineer is required to have a degree in software engineering, computer engineering, or computer science. Some countries legally require an engineering degree to be called &quot;engineer&quot;. 
==History==

British countess and mathematician Ada Lovelace is often considered to be the first computer programmer.
She authored an algorithm, which was published in October 1842, for calculating Bernoulli numbers on the Charles Babbage analytical engine. 
Because the machine was not completed in her lifetime, she never experienced the algorithm in action.

In 1941, German civil engineer Konrad Zuse was the first person to execute a program on a working, program-controlled, electronic computer. From 1943 to 1945, per computer scientist Wolfgang K. Giloi and AI professor Raúl Rojas et al., Zuse created the first, high-level programming language, Plankalkül.

Members of the 1945 ENIAC programming team of Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman have since been credited as the first professional computer programmers.

==The software industry==

The first company founded specifically to provide software products and services was the Computer Usage Company in 1955. Before that time, computers were programmed either by customers or the few commercial computer manufacturers of the time, such as Sperry Rand and IBM.

The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in mass-produced quantities. Universities, governments, and businesses created a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers; some were distributed between users of a particular machine for no charge, while others were sold on a commercial basis. Other firms, such as Computer Sciences Corporation (founded in 1959), also started to grow. Computer manufacturers soon started bundling operating systems, system software and programming environments with their machines; the IBM 1620 came with the 1620 Symbolic Programming System and FORTRAN.

The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the personal computer (PC) in the mid-1970s, which brought computing to the average office worker. In the following years, the PC also helped create a constantly growing market for games, applications and utility software. This resulted in increased demand for software developers for that period of time.

==Nature of the work==
Computer programmers write, test, debug, and maintain the detailed instructions, called computer programs, that computers must follow to perform their functions. Programmers also conceive, design, and test logical structures for solving problems by computer. Many technical innovations in programming — advanced computing technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming tools — have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization.

Programmers work in many settings, including corporate information technology (IT) departments, big software companies, small service firms and government entities of all sizes. Many professional programmers also work for consulting companies at client sites as contractors. Licensing is not typically required to work as a programmer, although professional certifications are commonly held by programmers. Programming is considered a profession.

Programmers&#x27; work varies widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs. For example, the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in a few hours. More complex ones may require more than a year of work, while others are never considered &#x27;complete&#x27; but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several programmers work together as a team under a senior programmer&#x27;s supervision.

===Types of software===
Programming editors, also known as source code editors, are text editors that are specifically designed for programmers or developers to write the source code of an application or a program. Most of these editors include features useful for programmers, which may include color syntax highlighting, auto indentation, auto-complete, bracket matching, syntax check, and allows plug-ins. These features aid the users during coding, debugging and testing.

==Globalization==

===Market changes in the UK===
According to BBC News, 17% of computer science students could not find work in their field six months after graduation in 2009 which was the highest rate of the university subjects surveyed while 0% of medical students were unemployed in the same survey.

===Market changes in the US===
After the crash of the dot-com bubble (1999–2001) and the Great Recession (2008), many U.S. programmers were left without work or with lower wages. In addition, enrollment in computer-related degrees and other STEM degrees (STEM attrition) in the US has been dropping for years, especially for women, which, according to Beaubouef and Mason, could be attributed to a lack of general interest in science and mathematics and also out of an apparent fear that programming will be subject to the same pressures as manufacturing and agriculture careers. For programmers, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Outlook originally predicted a growth for programmers of 12 percent from 2010 to 2020 and thereafter a decline of -7 percent from 2016 to 2026, a further decline of -9 percent from 2019 to 2029, a decline of -10 percent from 2021 to 2031. and then a decline of -11 percent from 2022 to 2032. Since computer programming can be done from anywhere in the world, companies sometimes hire programmers in countries where wages are lower. If domestic demand has increased, it is mainly to replace existing programmers who have retired or switched occupations. However, for software developers BLS projects current growth at 17% that is down from their prediction from 2019 to 2029 of a 22% increase in employment, from 1,469,200 to 1,785,200 jobs with a median base salary of $110,000 per year. This prediction is lower than the earlier 2010 to 2020 predicted increase of 30% for software developers. Though the distinction is somewhat ambiguous, software developers engage in a wider array of aspects of application development and are generally higher skilled than programmers, making outsourcing less of a risk. Another reason for the decline for programmers is their skills are being merged with other professions, such as developers, as employers increase the requirements for a position over time (i.e. Full-stack developer). Then there is the additional concern that recent advances in artificial intelligence might impact the demand for future generations of Software professions.

===Market changes in Japan===
As of 2024 in Japan, the demand for programmers is increasing rapidly due mainly to the aging demographics of their workforce and their low birth rate not being sufficient for replacement has led to more use of AI to help fill the gap. On the other hand, despite the fact that there are more than 1.2 million programmers in Japan as of 2020, more than 40% of Japanese companies say they do not have enough skilled and qualified IT personnel, including programmers; by 2030, the number of programmers will exceed 1.6 million, but about 800 000 people, including programmers, a shortage of engineers is expected to occur.

<text>Peter Albert David Singer (born 6 July 1946) is an Australian moral philosopher who is Emeritus Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University. Singer&#x27;s work specialises in applied ethics, approaching the subject from a secular, utilitarian perspective. He wrote the book &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; (1975), in which he argues for vegetarianism, and the essay &quot;Famine, Affluence, and Morality&quot;, which argues the moral imperative of donating to help the poor around the world. For most of his career, he was a preference utilitarian. He revealed in &quot;The Point of View of the Universe&quot; (2014), coauthored with Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek, that he had become a hedonistic utilitarian.

On two occasions, Singer served as chair of the philosophy department at Monash University, where he founded its Centre for Human Bioethics. In 1996, he stood unsuccessfully as a Greens candidate for the Australian Senate. In 2004, Singer was recognised as the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies. In 2005, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; placed him among Australia&#x27;s ten most influential public intellectuals. Singer is a cofounder of Animals Australia and the founder of the non-profit organization The Life You Can Save.

== Early life and education ==

Peter Singer was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, on 6 July 1946. His parents were Austrian Jews who immigrated to Australia from Vienna after Austria&#x27;s annexation (&quot;Anschluss&quot;) by Nazi Germany in 1938, and settled in Melbourne. His paternal grandparents were taken by the Nazis to Łódź, and were most likely murdered, since they were never heard from again; his maternal grandfather David Ernst Oppenheim (1881–1943), an educator and psychologist who collaborated with Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, was murdered in the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Oppenheim was a member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and wrote a joint article with Sigmund Freud, before joining the Adlerian Society for Individual Psychology. Singer later wrote a biography of Oppenheim.

Singer is an atheist and was raised in a prosperous, non-religious family. His father had a successful business importing tea and coffee. His family rarely observed Jewish holidays, and Singer declined to have a Bar Mitzvah. Singer attended Preshil, and later Scotch College. After leaving school, Singer studied law, history, and philosophy as a resident of Ormond College at the University of Melbourne, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1967. Singer explained that he elected to major in philosophy after his interest was piqued by discussions with his sister&#x27;s then-boyfriend. He earned a master&#x27;s degree for a thesis entitled &quot;Why Should I Be Moral?&quot; at the same university in 1969. He was awarded a scholarship to study at the University of Oxford and obtained from there a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1971 with a thesis on civil disobedience supervised by R. M. Hare and published as a book in 1973. Singer names Hare, Australian philosopher H. J. McCloskey and British philosopher J. L. H. Thomas, who taught him &quot;how to read and understand Hegel&quot;, as his most important mentors.

In the preface to &quot;Hegel: A Very Short Introduction&quot;, Singer recalls his time in Thomas&#x27; &quot;remarkable&quot; classes at Oxford where students were forced to &quot;probe passages of the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; sentence by sentence, until they yielded their meaning&quot;. One day at Balliol College in Oxford, he had what he refers to as probably the decisive formative experience of his life. He was having a discussion after class with fellow graduate student Richard Keshen, who would later become a professor at Cape Breton University. During their lunch Keshen opted to have a salad after being told that the spaghetti sauce contained meat. Singer had the spaghetti. Singer eventually questioned Keshen about his reason for avoiding meat. Keshen explained his ethical objections. Singer would later state, &quot;I&#x27;d never met a vegetarian who gave such a straightforward answer that I could understand and relate to.&quot; Keshen later introduced Singer to his vegetarian friends. Singer was able to find one book in which he could read up on the issue (&quot;Animal Machines&quot; by Ruth Harrison) and within a week or two he approached his wife saying that he thought they needed to make a change to their diet and that he did not think they could justify eating meat.

==Academic career ==
After spending three years as a Radcliffe lecturer at University College, Oxford, he was a visiting professor at New York University for 16 months, where he influenced the views of James Rachels and Peter Unger about animals and famine. In 1977, he returned to Melbourne where he spent most of his career, aside from appointments as visiting faculty abroad, until his move to Princeton in 1999.

In June 2011, Singer joined the professoriate of New College of the Humanities, a private college in London, in addition to his work at Princeton. Singer gave his last lecture at Princeton in 2023, and has retired. He has been a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2001.

According to philosopher Helga Kuhse, Singer is almost certainly the best-known and most widely read of all contemporary philosophers. Michael Specter wrote that Singer is among the most influential of contemporary philosophers. He co-founded the open-access &quot;Journal of Controversial Ideas&quot; along with bioethicist Francesca Minerva and moral philosopher Jeff McMahan in 2018.

== Applied ethics ==
Singer&#x27;s &quot;Practical Ethics&quot; (1979) analyzes why and how living beings&#x27; interests should be weighed. His principle of equal consideration of interests does not dictate equal treatment of all those with interests, since different interests warrant different treatment. While all have an interest in avoiding pain, relatively few have an interest in cultivating their abilities. Not only does his principle justify different treatment for different interests, but it allows different treatment for the same interest when diminishing marginal utility is a factor. For example, this approach would privilege a starving person&#x27;s interest in food over the same interest of someone who is only slightly hungry. Among the more important human interests are those in avoiding pain, in developing one&#x27;s abilities, in satisfying basic needs for food and shelter, in enjoying warm personal relationships, in being free to pursue one&#x27;s projects without interference, &quot;and many others&quot;. The fundamental interest that entitles a being to equal consideration is the capacity for &quot;suffering and/or enjoyment or happiness&quot;. Singer holds that a being&#x27;s interests should always be weighed according to that being&#x27;s concrete needs. Ethical conduct is justified by reasons that go beyond prudence to &quot;something bigger than the individual&quot;, addressing a larger audience. Singer thinks this going-beyond identifies moral reasons as &quot;somehow universal&quot;, specifically in the injunction to &#x27;love thy neighbour as thyself&#x27;, interpreted by him as demanding that one give the same weight to the interests of others as one gives to one&#x27;s own interests. This universalising step, which Singer traces from Immanuel Kant to Hare,is crucial and sets him apart from those moral theorists, from Thomas Hobbes to David Gauthier, who tie morality to prudence. Universalisation leads directly to utilitarianism, Singer argues, on the strength of the thought that one&#x27;s own interests cannot count for more than the interests of others.

The utilitarian conclusion is that one must adopt the course of action that likely maximises the weighted interests of those affected. Singer&#x27;s universalising step applies to interests without reference to who has them, whereas the Kantian&#x27;s applies to the judgments of rational agents (for example in Kant&#x27;s kingdom of Ends or John Rawls&#x27;s original position). Singer regards Kantian universalisation as unjust to animals. As for the Hobbesians, Singer attempts a response in the final chapter of &quot;Practical Ethics&quot;, arguing that self-interested reasons support adoption of the moral point of view, such as &quot;the paradox of hedonism&quot;, which counsels that happiness is best found by not looking for it, and the need most people feel to relate to something larger than their own concerns. Singer identifies as a sentientist; sentientism is an ethical position that grants moral consideration to all sentient beings.

=== Effective altruism and world poverty ===
Singer&#x27;s ideas have contributed to the rise of effective altruism. He argues that people should try not only to reduce suffering but to reduce it in the most effective manner possible. While Singer has previously written at length about the moral imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the meat industry, he writes about how the effective altruism movement is doing these things more effectively in his 2015 book &quot;The Most Good You Can Do&quot;. He is a board member of Animal Charity Evaluators, a charity evaluator used by many members of the effective altruism community which recommends the most cost-effective animal advocacy charities and interventions.

His own organisation, The Life You Can Save (TLYCS), recommends a selection of charities deemed by charity evaluators such as GiveWell to be the most effective when it comes to helping those in extreme poverty. TLYCS was founded after Singer released his 2009 eponymous book, in which he argues more generally in favour of giving to charities that help to end global poverty. In particular, he expands upon some of the arguments made in his 1972 essay &quot;Famine, Affluence, and Morality&quot;, in which he posits that citizens of rich nations are morally obligated to give at least some of their disposable income to charities that help the global poor. He supports this using the &quot;drowning child analogy&quot;, which states that most people would rescue a drowning child from a pond, even if it meant that their expensive clothes were ruined. He argues that similarly, lives could be saved, notably by donating to effective charities, and that as a result a significant portion of the money spent on unnecessary possessions should instead be donate to charity. Since November 2009, Singer is a member of Giving What We Can, an international organisation whose members pledge to give at least 10% of their income to effective charities.

=== Animal liberation and speciesism ===

Published in 1975, &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; has been cited as a formative influence on leaders of the modern animal liberation movement. The central argument of the book is an expansion of the utilitarian concept that &quot;the greatest good of the greatest number&quot; is the only measure of good or ethical behaviour, and Singer believes that there is no reason not to apply this principle to other animals, arguing that the boundary between human and &quot;animal&quot; is completely arbitrary. For example, there are far more differences between a great ape and an oyster than between a human and a great ape, and yet the former two are lumped together as &quot;animals&quot;, whereas we are considered &quot;human&quot; in a way that supposedly differentiates us from all other &quot;animals&quot;. He popularised the term &quot;speciesism&quot;, which had been coined by English writer Richard D. Ryder to describe the practice of privileging humans over other animals, and therefore argues in favour of the equal consideration of interests of all sentient beings.

In &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;, Singer argues in favour of vegetarianism and against most animal experimentation. He stated in a 2006 interview that he does not eat meat and that he has been a vegetarian since 1971. He also said that he has &quot;gradually become increasingly vegan&quot; and that &quot;I am largely vegan but I&#x27;m a flexible vegan. I don&#x27;t go to the supermarket and buy non-vegan stuff for myself. But when I&#x27;m traveling or going to other people&#x27;s places I will be quite happy to eat vegetarian rather than vegan.&quot; In 2022, Singer stated that he is not fully vegan because he occasionally consumes oysters, mussels, and clams due to their lack of a central nervous system. According to Singer, meat-eating can be ethically permissible if &quot;farms really give the animals good lives, and then humanely kill them, preferably without transporting them to slaughterhouses or disturbing them. In &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;, I don&#x27;t really say that it&#x27;s the killing that makes [meat-eating] wrong, it&#x27;s the suffering.&quot;

In an article for the online publication Chinadialogue, Singer called Western-style meat production cruel, unhealthy, and damaging to the ecosystem. He rejected the idea that the method was necessary to meet the population&#x27;s increasing demand, explaining that animals in factory farms have to eat food grown explicitly for them, and they burn up most of the food&#x27;s energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm. In a 2010 &quot;Guardian&quot; article he titled, &quot;Fish: the forgotten victims on our plate&quot;, Singer drew attention to the welfare of fish. He quoted author Alison Mood&#x27;s startling statistics from a report she wrote, which was released on fishcount.org.uk just a month before the &quot;Guardian&quot; article. Singer states that she &quot;has put together what may well be the first-ever systematic estimate of the size of the annual global capture of wild fish. It is, she calculates, in the order of one trillion, although it could be as high as 2.7tn.&quot;

Some chapters of &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; are dedicated to criticising testing on animals. Unlike groups such as PETA, Singer is willing to accept testing when there is a clear benefit for medicine. In November 2006, Singer appeared on the BBC programme &quot;Monkeys, Rats and Me: Animal Testing&quot; and said that he felt that Tipu Aziz&#x27;s experiments on monkeys for research into treating Parkinson&#x27;s disease could be justified. Whereas Singer has continued since the publication of &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; to promote vegetarianism and veganism, he has been much less vocal in recent years on the subject of animal experimentation. Singer has defended some of the actions of the Animal Liberation Front such as the stealing of footage from Thomas Gennarelli&#x27;s laboratory in May 1984 (as shown in the documentary &quot;Unnecessary Fuss&quot;) but condemned other actions such as the use of explosives by some animal-rights activists, and sees the freeing of captive animals as largely futile when they are easily replaced. Singer features in the 2017 documentary &quot;Empathy&quot;, directed by Ed Antoja, which aims to promote a more respectful way of life towards all animals. The documentary won the &quot;Public Choice Award&quot; of the Greenpeace Film Festival. Singer has frequently collaborated on op-eds and otherwise with animal rights advocate Karen Dawn.

=== Other views ===

==== Meta-ethical views ====

In the past, Singer did not hold that objective moral values exist, on the basis that reason could favour both egoism and equal consideration of interests. Singer himself adopted utilitarianism on the basis that people&#x27;s preferences can be universalised, leading to a situation where one takes the &quot;point of view of the universe&quot; and &quot;an impartial standpoint&quot;. In the second edition of &quot;Practical Ethics&quot;, he concedes that the question of why we should act morally &quot;cannot be given an answer that will provide everyone with overwhelming reasons for acting morally&quot;.

When co-authoring &quot;The Point of View of the Universe&quot; (2014), Singer shifted to the position that objective moral values do exist, and defends the 19th century utilitarian philosopher Henry Sidgwick&#x27;s view that objective morality can be derived from fundamental moral axioms that are knowable by reason. Additionally, he endorses Derek Parfit&#x27;s view that there are object-given reasons for action. Furthermore, Singer and Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek (the co-author of the book) argue that evolutionary debunking arguments can be used to demonstrate that it is more rational to take the impartial standpoint of &quot;the point of view of the universe&quot;, as opposed to egoism—pursuing one&#x27;s own self-interest—because the existence of egoism is more likely to be the product of evolution by natural selection, rather than because it is correct, whereas taking an impartial standpoint and equally considering the interests of all sentient beings is in conflict with what we would expect from natural selection, meaning that it is more likely that impartiality in ethics is the correct stance to pursue.

==== Political views ====

Whilst a student in Melbourne, Singer campaigned against the Vietnam War as president of the Melbourne University Campaign Against Conscription. He also spoke publicly for the legalization of abortion in Australia. Singer joined the Australian Labor Party in 1974 but resigned after disillusionment with the centrist leadership of Bob Hawke; in 1992, he became a founding member of the Victorian Greens. He has run for political office twice for the Greens: he received 28% of the vote in the 1994 Kooyong by-election, and received 3% of the vote in 1996 when running for the Australian Senate (elected by proportional representation). Before the 1996 election, he co-authored a book &quot;The Greens&quot; with Bob Brown. In &quot;A Darwinian Left&quot;, Singer outlines a plan for the political left to adapt to the lessons of evolutionary biology. He says that evolutionary psychology suggests that humans naturally tend to be self-interested. He further argues that the evidence that selfish tendencies are natural must not be taken as evidence that selfishness is &quot;right&quot;. He concludes that game theory (the mathematical study of strategy) and experiments in psychology offer hope that self-interested people would make short-term sacrifices for the good of others, if society provides the right conditions.

Singer argues that although humans possess selfish, competitive tendencies naturally, they have a substantial capacity for cooperation that also has been selected for during human evolution. Singer&#x27;s writing in &quot;Greater Good&quot; magazine, published by the Greater Good Science Center of the University of California, Berkeley, explores scientific studies on why people are compassionate, selfless, and capable of forming peaceful relationships. Singer has criticized the United States for receiving &quot;oil from countries run by dictators ... who pocket most of the&quot; financial gains, thus &quot;keeping the people in poverty&quot;. Singer believes that the wealth of these countries &quot;should belong to the people&quot; within them rather than their &quot;de facto government. In paying dictators for their oil, we are in effect buying stolen goods, and helping to keep people in poverty.&quot; Singer holds that America &quot;should be doing more to assist people in extreme poverty&quot;. He is disappointed in U.S. foreign aid policy, deeming it &quot;a very small proportion of our GDP, less than a quarter of some other affluent nations.&quot; Singer maintains that little &quot;private philanthropy from the U.S.&quot; is &quot;directed to helping people in extreme poverty, although there are some exceptions, most notably, of course, the Gates Foundation.&quot;

Singer describes himself as not anti-capitalist, stating in a 2010 interview with the New Left Project: &quot;Capitalism is very far from a perfect system, but so far we have yet to find anything that clearly does a better job of meeting human needs than a regulated capitalist economy coupled with a welfare and health care system that meets the basic needs of those who do not thrive in the capitalist economy.&quot; Singer added that &quot;[i]f we ever do find a better system, I&#x27;ll be happy to call myself an anti-capitalist.&quot; Similarly, in his book &quot;Marx&quot;, Singer is sympathetic to Karl Marx&#x27;s criticism of capitalism but is skeptical about whether a better system is likely to be created, writing: &quot;Marx saw that capitalism is a wasteful, irrational system, a system which controls us when we should be controlling it. That insight is still valid; but we can now see that the construction of a free and equal society is a more difficult task than Marx realized.&quot;

Singer is opposed to the death penalty, claiming that it does not effectively deter the crimes for which it is the punitive measure, and that he cannot see any other justification for it. In 2010, Singer signed a petition renouncing his right of return to Israel because it is &quot;a form of racist privilege that abets the colonial oppression of the Palestinians.&quot; Singer called on Jill Stein to withdraw from the 2016 United States presidential election in states that were close between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on the grounds that the stakes were &quot;too high&quot;. He argued against the view that there was no significant difference between Clinton and Trump, whilst also saying that he would not advocate such a tactic in Australia&#x27;s electoral system, which allows for ranking of preferences. When writing in 2017 on Trump&#x27;s climate change denial and plans to withdraw from the Paris Accords, Singer advocated a boycott of all consumer goods from the United States to pressure the Trump administration to change its environmental policies. In 2021, Singer described the war on drugs as an expensive, ineffective and extremely harmful policy.

==== Euthanasia and infanticide ====

Singer has argued that the right to life is essentially tied to a being&#x27;s capacity to hold preferences. In &quot;Practical Ethics&quot;, Singer argues in favour of abortion rights on the grounds that fetuses are neither rational nor self-aware, and can therefore hold no preferences. As a result, he argues that the preference of a mother to have an abortion automatically takes precedence. In sum, Singer argues that a fetus lacks personhood. Similar to his argument for abortion rights, Singer argues that newborns lack the essential characteristics of personhood—&quot;rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness&quot;—and therefore &quot;killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living&quot;. Singer has clarified that his &quot;view of when life begins isn&#x27;t very different from that of opponents of abortion.&quot; He deems it not &quot;unreasonable to hold that an individual human life begins at conception. If it doesn&#x27;t, then it begins about 14 days later, when it is no longer possible for the embryo to divide into twins or other multiples.&quot; Singer disagrees with abortion rights opponents in that he does not &quot;think that the fact that an embryo is a living human being is sufficient to show that it is wrong to kill it.&quot; Singer wishes &quot;to see American jurisprudence, and the national abortion debate, take up the question of which capacities a human being needs to have in order for it to be wrong to kill it&quot; as well as &quot;when, in the development of the early human being, these capacities are present.&quot;

Singer classifies euthanasia as voluntary, involuntary, or non-voluntary. Voluntary euthanasia is that to which the subject consents. He argues in favour of voluntary euthanasia and some forms of non-voluntary euthanasia, including infanticide in certain instances, but opposes involuntary euthanasia. Bioethicists associated with the disability rights and disability studies communities have argued that his epistemology is based on ableist conceptions of disability. Singer&#x27;s positions have also been criticised by some advocates for disability rights and right-to-life supporters, concerned with what they see as his attacks upon human dignity. Religious critics have argued that Singer&#x27;s ethics ignores and undermines the traditional notion of the sanctity of life. Singer agrees and believes the notion of the sanctity of life ought to be discarded as outdated, unscientific, and irrelevant to understanding problems in contemporary bioethics. Disability rights activists have held many protests against Singer at Princeton University and at his lectures over the years. Singer has replied that many people judge him based on secondhand summaries and short quotations taken out of context, not on his books or articles, and that his aim is to elevate the status of animals, not to lower that of humans.

American publisher Steve Forbes ceased his donations to Princeton University in 1999 because of Singer&#x27;s appointment to a prestigious professorship. Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal wrote to organisers of a Swedish book fair to which Singer was invited that &quot;[a] professor of morals ... who justifies the right to kill handicapped newborns ... is in my opinion unacceptable for representation at your level.&quot; Conservative psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple wrote in 2010 that Singerian moral universalism is &quot;preposterous—psychologically, theoretically, and practically&quot;. In 2002, disability rights activist Harriet McBryde Johnson debated Singer, challenging his belief that it is morally permissible to euthanise newborn children with severe disabilities. &quot;Unspeakable Conversations&quot;, Johnson&#x27;s account of her encounters with Singer and the pro-euthanasia movement, was published in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; in 2003. In 2015, Singer debated Archbishop Anthony Fisher on the legalisation of euthanasia at Sydney Town Hall. Singer rejected arguments that legalising euthanasia would result in a slippery slope where the practice might become widespread as a means to remove undesirable people for financial or other motives. Singer has experienced the complexities of some of these questions in his own life. His mother had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He said, &quot;I think this has made me see how the issues of someone with these kinds of problems are really very difficult.&quot; In an interview with Ronald Bailey, published in December 2000, he explained that his sister shares the responsibility of making decisions about his mother. He said that, if he were solely responsible, his mother might not continue to live.

==== Surrogacy ====
In 1985, Singer wrote a book with the physician Deanne Wells arguing that surrogate motherhood should be allowed and regulated by the state by establishing nonprofit &#x27;State Surrogacy Boards&#x27;, which would ensure fairness between surrogate mothers and surrogacy-seeking parents. Singer and Wells endorsed both the payment of medical expenses endured by surrogate mothers and an extra &quot;fair fee&quot; to compensate the surrogate mother.

==== Religion ====

Singer was a speaker at the 2012 Global Atheist Convention. He has debated with Christians including John Lennox and Dinesh D&#x27;Souza. Singer has pointed to the problem of evil as an objection against the Christian conception of God. He stated: &quot;The evidence of our own eyes makes it more plausible to believe that the world was not created by any god at all. If, however, we insist on believing in divine creation, we are forced to admit that the god who made the world cannot be all-powerful and all good. He must be either evil or a bungler.&quot; In keeping with his considerations of nonhuman animals, Singer also takes issue with the original sin reply to the problem of evil, saying that, &quot;animals also suffer from floods, fires, and droughts, and, since they are not descended from Adam and Eve, they cannot have inherited original sin.&quot;

====Medical intervention in the aging process====
Singer supports the view that medical intervention into the ageing process would do more to improve human life than research on therapies for specific chronic diseases in the developed world. He stated:

Singer worries that &quot;If we discover how to slow aging, we might have a world in which the poor majority must face death at a time when members of the rich minority are only a 10th of the way through their expected lifespans&quot;, thus risking that &quot;overcoming aging will increase the stock of injustice in the world&quot;. Singer cautiously highlights that as with other medical developments, they would reach the more economically disadvantaged over time once developed, whereas they can never do so if they are not. As to the concern that longer lives might contribute to overpopulation, Singer notes that &quot;success in overcoming aging could itself ... delay or eliminate menopause, enabling women to have their first children much later than they can now&quot; and thus slowing the birth rate, and also that technology may reduce the consequences of rising human populations by (for instance) enabling more zero-greenhouse gas energy sources.

In 2012, Singer&#x27;s department sponsored the &quot;Science and Ethics of Eliminating Aging&quot; seminar at Princeton.

===Protests===

In 1989 and 1990, Singer&#x27;s work was the subject of a number of protests in Germany. A course in ethics led by Hartmut Kliemt at the University of Duisburg where the main text used was Singer&#x27;s &quot;Practical Ethics&quot; was, according to Singer, &quot;subjected to organised and repeated disruption by protesters objecting to the use of the book on the grounds that in one of its ten chapters it advocates active euthanasia for severely disabled newborn infants&quot;. The protests led to the course being shut down.

When Singer tried to speak during a lecture at Saarbrücken, he was interrupted by a group of protesters including advocates for disability rights. One of the protesters expressed that entering serious discussions would be a tactical error. The same year, Singer was invited to speak in Marburg at a European symposium on &quot;Bioengineering, Ethics and Mental Disability&quot;. The invitation was fiercely attacked by leading intellectuals and organisations in the German media, with an article in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; comparing Singer&#x27;s positions to Nazism. Eventually, the symposium was cancelled and Singer&#x27;s invitation withdrawn.

A lecture at the Zoological Institute of the University of Zurich was interrupted by two groups of protesters. The first group was a group of disabled people who staged a brief protest at the beginning of the lecture. They objected to inviting an advocate of euthanasia to speak. At the end of this protest, when Singer tried to address their concerns, a second group of protesters rose and began chanting &quot;Singer raus! Singer raus!&quot; (&quot;Singer out!&quot; in German) When Singer attempted to respond, a protester jumped on stage and grabbed his glasses, and the host ended the lecture. Singer explains &quot;my views are not threatening to anyone, even minimally&quot;, and says that some groups play on the anxieties of those who hear only keywords that are understandably worrying (given the constant fears of ever repeating the Holocaust) if taken with any less than the full context of his belief system.

In 1991, Singer was due to speak along with R. M. Hare and at the 15th International Wittgenstein Symposium in Kirchberg am Wechsel, Austria. Singer has stated that threats were made to Adolf Hübner, then the president of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society, that the conference would be disrupted if Singer and Meggle were given a platform. Hübner proposed to the board of the society that Singer&#x27;s invitation, as well as the invitations of a number of other speakers, be withdrawn. The Society decided to cancel the symposium.

In an article originally published in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Singer argued that the protests dramatically increased the amount of coverage he received, saying that &quot;instead of a few hundred people hearing views at lectures in Marburg and Dortmund, several millions read about them or listened to them on television&quot;. Despite this, Singer argues that it has led to a difficult intellectual climate, with professors in Germany unable to teach courses on applied ethics and campaigns demanding the resignation of professors who invited Singer to speak.

=== Criticism ===
Singer was criticised in 2017 for an op-ed co-written with Jeff McMahan, in which he defends Anna Stubblefield, who was convicted of aggravated sexual assault against D.J., a man with severe physical disability. Singer and McMahan argued that the judge refused to consider independent evidence that D.J. was indirectly able to communicate, and could have been interrogated. They argued that Anna Stubblefield believes her love to be reciprocal, and that D.J. still had not given sign of hostility towards Stubblefield. Nathan J. Robinson, founder of &quot;Current Affairs&quot;, criticised when Singer and McMahan wrote that even supposing that D.J. is not just physically but also cognitively impaired (which they contest), then D.J. may not even understand the concept of consent, and it &quot;seems reasonable to assume that the experience was pleasurable to him&quot;, as &quot;he was capable of struggling to resist.&quot; Robinson called this a &quot;rape&quot;, and considers that Singer and McMahan&#x27;s argument implies that it would be permissible to rape or sexually assault sufficiently disabled people as long as they do not try to resist.

Roger Scruton was critical of the consequentialist, utilitarian approach of Singer. Scruton alleged that Singer&#x27;s works, including &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; (1975), &quot;contain little or no philosophical argument. They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals.&quot; Anthropologists have criticised Singer&#x27;s foundational essay &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;, published in 1973, for comparing the interests of &quot;slum children&quot; with the interests of the rats that bite them – at a time when poor and predominantly Black American children were regularly attacked and bitten by rats, sometimes fatally.

== Recognition ==
Singer was elected a corresponding fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities in 1981. He was inducted into the United States Animal Rights Hall of Fame in 2000. In June 2012, Singer was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for &quot;eminent service to philosophy and bioethics as a leader of public debate and communicator of ideas in the areas of global poverty, animal welfare and the human condition&quot;. Singer received &quot;Philosophy Now&quot;″s 2016 Award for Contributions in the Fight Against Stupidity for his efforts &quot;to disturb the comfortable complacency with which many of us habitually ignore the desperate needs of others ... particularly for this work as it relates to the Effective Altruism movement&quot;.

In 2018, Singer was cited in the book &quot;Rescuing Ladybugs&quot; by author and animal advocate Jennifer Skiff as a &quot;hero among heroes in the world&quot; who, in arguing against speciesism &quot;gave the modern world permission to believe what we innately know – that animals are sentient and that we have a moral obligation not to exploit or mistreat them.&quot; The book states that Singer&#x27;s &quot;moral philosophy on animal equality was sparked when he asked a fellow student at Oxford University a simple question about his eating habits.&quot;

In 2021, Singer was awarded the US$1-million Berggruen Prize, and decided to give it away. He decided in particular to give half of the prize money to his foundation The Life You Can Save, because &quot;over the last three years, each dollar spent by it generated an average of $17 in donations for its recommended nonprofits&quot;. He added he has never taken money for personal use from the organisation. Moreover, he plans to donate more than a third of the money to organisations combating intensive animal farming, and recommended as effective by Animal Charity Evaluators.

For 2022, Singer received the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the category of &quot;Humanities and Social Sciences&quot;.

==Personal life==
Since 1968, Singer has been married to Renata Singer (née Diamond; born in 1947 in Wałbrzych, Poland). They have three children: Ruth, a textile artist; Marion, a law student and youth arts specialist; and Esther, a linguist and teacher. Singer&#x27;s wife is a novelist and author, and has collaborated on publications with her husband. Until 2021, she was president of the Kadimah Jewish Cultural Centre and National Library in Melbourne.

Among its most important heritage sites are the Renaissance Old Town, Town Hall and Gothic Cathedral.

Poznań is the fifth-largest and one of the oldest cities in Poland. As of 2023, the city&#x27;s population is 540,146, while the Poznań metropolitan area (&quot;Metropolia Poznań&quot;) comprising Poznań County and several other communities is inhabited by over 1.029 million people. It is one of four historical capitals of medieval Poland and the ancient capital of the Greater Poland region, currently the administrative capital of the province called Greater Poland Voivodeship.

Poznań is a center of trade, sport, education, technology and tourism. It is an important academic site, with about 130,000 students and Adam Mickiewicz University, the third largest Polish university. The city serves as the seat of the oldest Polish diocese, now being one of the most populous Catholic archdioceses in the country. The city also hosts the Poznań International Fair, the biggest industrial fair in Poland and one of the largest fairs in Europe. The city&#x27;s other renowned landmarks include the National Museum, Grand Theatre, Fara Church and the Imperial Castle.

Poznań is classified as a Gamma−global city by Globalization and World Cities Research Network. According to several rankings it is one of the most business-friendly cities in Poland. It also ranks highly in safety and healthcare quality. The city of Poznań has also, many times, won the prize awarded by &quot;Superbrands&quot; for a very high quality city brand. In 2012, the Poznań&#x27;s Art and Business Centre &quot;Stary Browar&quot; won a competition organised by National Geographic Traveler and was given the first prize as one of the seven &quot;New Polish Wonders&quot;. Companies headquartered in the city include energy provider Enea, e-commerce company Allegro and convenience store chain Żabka.

The official patron saints of Poznań are Saint Peter and Paul of Tarsus, the patrons of the cathedral. Martin of Tours – the patron of the main street Święty Marcin – is also regarded as one of the patron saints of the city.

==Names==

The name Poznań probably comes from a personal name &quot;Poznan&quot;, which was in turn derived from the Polish participle – &quot;one who is known/recognized&quot;, and would mean &quot;Poznan&#x27;s town&quot;. It is also possible that the name comes directly from the verb &quot;poznać&quot;, which means &quot;to get to know&quot; or &quot;to recognize&quot;, so it may simply mean &quot;known town&quot;.

The earliest surviving references to the city are found in the chronicles of Thietmar of Merseburg written between 1012 and 1018: (&quot;bishop of Poznań&quot;, in an entry for 970) and &quot;ab urbe Posnani&quot; (&quot;from the city of Poznań&quot;, for 1005). The city&#x27;s name appears in documents in the Latin nominative case as &quot;Posnania&quot; in 1236 and &quot;Poznania&quot; in 1247. The phrase &quot;in Poznan&quot; appears in 1146 and 1244.

The city&#x27;s full official name is &quot;Stołeczne Miasto Poznań&quot; (The Capital City of Poznań), in reference to its role as a centre of political power in the early Polish state under the Piast dynasty. Poznań is known as &quot;Posen&quot; in German, and was officially called &quot;Haupt- und Residenzstadt Posen&quot; (Capital and Residence City of Posen) between 20 August 1910 and 28 November 1918. The Latin names of the city are &quot;Posnania&quot; and &quot;Civitas Posnaniensis&quot;. Its Yiddish name is , or &quot;Poyzn&quot;.

In Polish, the city&#x27;s name has masculine grammatical gender.

==History==
===Early Middle Ages===
For centuries before the Christianization of Poland (an event that essentially is credited as the creation of the very first Polish state, the Duchy of Poland), Poznań was an important cultural and political centre of the Western Polans. It consisted of a fortified stronghold between the Warta and Cybina rivers on what is now Ostrów Tumski. Mieszko I, the first historically recorded ruler of the West Polans and of the early Polish state which they dominated, built one of his main stable headquarters in Poznań. Mieszko&#x27;s baptism in AD 966, seen as a defining moment in the Christianization of the Polish state, may have taken place in Poznań.

===11th to 16th centuries===

Following the baptism, construction began of Poznań&#x27;s cathedral, the first in Poland. Poznań was probably the main seat of the first missionary bishop sent to Poland, Bishop Jordan. The Congress of Gniezno in 1000 led to the country&#x27;s first permanent archbishopric being established in Gniezno (which is generally regarded as Poland&#x27;s capital in that period), although Poznań continued to have independent bishops of its own. Poznań&#x27;s cathedral was the place of burial of the early Piast monarchs, among them Mieszko I, Bolesław I the Brave, Mieszko II Lambert, Casimir I, and later of Przemysł I and Przemysł II.

The pagan reaction that followed Mieszko II&#x27;s death (probably in Poznań) in 1034 left the region weak, and in 1038, Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia sacked and destroyed both Poznań and Gniezno. Poland was reunited under Casimir I the Restorer in 1039, but the capital was moved to Kraków, which had been relatively unaffected by the troubles. In 1138, by the testament of Boleslaus III, Poland was divided into separate duchies under the late king&#x27;s sons, and Poznań and its surroundings became the domain of Mieszko III the Old, the first of the Dukes of Greater Poland. This period of fragmentation lasted until 1320. Duchies frequently changed hands; control of Poznań, Gniezno and Kalisz sometimes lay with a single duke, but at other times these constituted separate duchies.

In about 1249, Duke Przemysł I began constructing what would become the Royal Castle on a hill on the left bank of the Warta. Then in 1253, Przemysł issued a charter to Thomas of Gubin for the founding of a town under Magdeburg law, between the castle and the river. Thomas brought a large number of German settlers to aid in the building and settlement of the city – this is an example of the German eastern migration () characteristic of that period. The city, which covered the area of today&#x27;s Old Town neighbourhood, was surrounded by a defensive wall, integrated with the castle. The royal chancery and the university ensured a first flourishing of Polish literary culture in the city.

In reunited Poland, and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Poznań was the seat of a voivodeship. The city&#x27;s importance began to grow in the Jagiellonian period, due to its position on trading routes from Lithuania and Ruthenia to western Europe. It would become a major center for the fur trade by the late 16th century. Suburban settlements developed around the city walls, on the river islands, and on the right bank, with some (Ostrów Tumski, Śródka, Chwaliszewo, Ostrówek) obtaining their own town charters. However, the city&#x27;s development was hampered by regular major fires and floods. On 2 May 1536 a fire destroyed 175 buildings, including the castle, the town hall, the monastery, and the suburban settlement called St. Martin. In 1519, the Lubrański Academy had been established in Poznań as an institution of higher education, but without the right to award degrees, which was reserved to Kraków&#x27;s Jagiellonian University. However, the Jesuits&#x27; college, founded in the city in 1571 during the Counter-Reformation, had the right to award degrees from 1611 until 1773, when it was combined with the academy.

===17th and 18th centuries===
In the second half of the 17th century and most of the 18th, Poznań was severely affected by a series of wars, attendant military occupations, lootings and destruction – the Second and Third Northern Wars, the War of the Polish Succession, the Seven Years&#x27; War and the Bar Confederation. During the Deluge, Poznań&#x27;s Jewish community was accused of collaborating with the invading Swedish enemy, and as a result suffered pogroms carried out by both the city&#x27;s non-Jewish residents and units of the Polish Crown Army.

It was also hit by frequent outbreaks of plague, and by floods, particularly that of 1736, which destroyed most of the suburban buildings. The population of the conurbation declined from 20,000 around 1600 to 6,000 around 1730, and Bambergian and Dutch settlers (Bambers and Olęders) were brought in to rebuild the devastated suburbs. In 1778, a &quot;Committee of Good Order&quot; (&quot;Komisja Dobrego Porządku&quot;) was established in the city, which oversaw rebuilding efforts and reorganized the city&#x27;s administration. However, in 1793, in the Second Partition of Poland, Poznań came under the control of the Kingdom of Prussia, becoming part of (and initially the seat of) the province of South Prussia.

===19th century to World War I===
The Prussian authorities expanded the city boundaries, making the walled city and its closest suburbs into a single administrative unit. Left-bank suburbs were incorporated in 1797, and Ostrów Tumski, Chwaliszewo, Śródka, Ostrówek and Łacina (St. Roch) in 1800. The old city walls were taken down in the early 19th century, and major development took place to the west of the old city, with many of the main streets of today&#x27;s city center being laid out.

In the Greater Poland uprising of 1806, Polish soldiers and civilian volunteers assisted the efforts of Napoleon by driving out Prussian forces from the region. The city became a part of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, and was the seat of Poznań Department – a unit of administrative division and local government. However, in 1815, following the Congress of Vienna, the region was returned to Prussia, and Poznań became the capital of the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Posen. Around 1820, Poznań had over 20,000 inhabitants, 70% of whom were Poles, 20% Jews, and 10% Germans.

The city continued to expand, and various projects were funded by Polish philanthropists, such as the Raczyński Library and the Bazar hotel. The city&#x27;s first railway, running north-west to Stargard, opened in 1848. Due to its strategic location, the Prussian authorities intended to make Poznań into a fortress city, building a ring of defensive fortifications around it. Work began on the citadel with &quot;Fort Winiary&quot; in 1828, and in subsequent years the entire set of defenses called &quot;Festung Posen&quot; was completed.

A Greater Poland Uprising during the Revolutions of 1848 was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Grand Duchy lost its remaining autonomy, Poznań becoming simply the capital of the Prussian Province of Posen. It would become part of the German Empire with the unification of German states in 1871. Polish patriots continued to form societies such as the Central Economic Society for the Grand Duchy of Poznań, and Polish Theatre opened in 1875. It became a national stage for the inhabitants of the province of Posen, and even in whole Greater Poland region, acting as a mainstay of polish tradition and culture, and as a sign of resistance against the restrictive policies of the Prussian partition authorities. However, the authorities made efforts to Germanize the region, particularly through the Prussian Settlement Commission founded in 1886. Germans accounted for 38% of the city&#x27;s population in 1867, though this percentage would later decline somewhat, particularly after the region returned to Poland.

Another expansion of &quot;Festung Posen&quot; was planned, with an outer ring of more widely spaced forts around the perimeter of the city. Building of the first nine forts began in 1876, and nine intermediate forts were built from 1887. The inner ring of fortifications was now considered obsolete and came to be mostly taken down by the early 20th century, although the citadel remained in use. This made space for further civilian construction, particularly the Prussian Royal Residence Palace (&quot;Zamek&quot;) which was completed in 1910, and other grand buildings around it, including today&#x27;s central university buildings and the opera house. The city&#x27;s boundaries were also significantly extended to take in former suburban villages: Piotrowo and Berdychowo in 1896, Łazarz, Górczyn, Jeżyce and Wilda in 1900, and Sołacz in 1907.

In 1910, Poznań had 156,696 inhabitants, of which nearly 60% were Poles (over 91,000 Polish inhabitants of the city), and around 40% were Germans (over 65,000 German inhabitants of the city). Other nationalities accounted for 1-2% of the population (mainly Jews). Germans tended to settle in the newer western part of the city, the &quot;Kaiserviertel&quot; or Kaiser district, Poles in the older east side. And while there was tension between the two major populations there was also some overlap between them, particularly in cultural events.

===Interbellum===

At the end of World War I, the final Greater Poland Uprising in 1918–1919 brought Poznań and most of the region back to newly reborn Poland, which was confirmed by the Treaty of Versailles. The local German populace had to acquire Polish citizenship or leave the country. This led to a wide emigration of the ethnic Germans of the town&#x27;s population – the town&#x27;s German population decreased from 65,321 in 1910 to 5,980 in 1926 and further to 4,387 in 1934.

In the interwar Second Polish Republic, the city again became the capital of Poznań Voivodeship. Poznań&#x27;s university, today called Adam Mickiewicz University, was founded in 1919, and in 1924 the Poznań International Fair began. In 1929, the fair site was the venue for a major National Exhibition (&quot;Powszechna Wystawa Krajowa&quot;, popularly &quot;PeWuKa&quot;) marking the tenth anniversary of independence; organized on a space of 650,000 square metres it attracted around 4.5 million visitors. In the 1930s, the fair ranked as European fourth largest organiser of international trade events. The city&#x27;s boundaries were again expanded in 1925 to include Główna, Komandoria, Rataje, Starołęka, Dębiec, Szeląg and Winogrady, and in 1933: Golęcin and Podolany.

===World War II===
During the German occupation of 1939–1945, Poznań was incorporated into the Nazi Germany as the capital of &quot;Reichsgau Wartheland&quot;. Many Polish inhabitants, even children as young as 10, were executed, arrested, expelled to the General Government or used as forced labour. Polish children were also kidnapped and deported to an infamous camp for Polish children in Łódź. At the same time, many Germans and &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; were settled in the city. The German population increased from around 5,000 in 1939 (some 2% of the inhabitants) to around 95,000 in 1944.

The Jewish community&#x27;s history in the city dates back to the 13th century. In the past, the Jewish council in Poznan became one of the oldest and most important Jewish councils in Poland. The pre-war Jewish population of at least about 2,000 were mostly murdered in the Holocaust.

A concentration camp was set up in Fort VII, one of the 19th-century perimeter forts. The camp was later moved to Żabikowo south of Poznań. Also the Stalag XXI-D German prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs of various nationalities was based in the city.

The Polish resistance was active in Poznań with various organizations and activities, and even an underground Polish parliament was established in the city.

The Nazi authorities significantly expanded Poznań&#x27;s boundaries to include most of the present-day area of the city; these boundaries were retained after the war. Poznań was captured by the Red Army, assisted by Polish volunteers, on 23 February 1945 following the Battle of Poznań, in which the German army conducted a last-ditch defense in line with Hitler&#x27;s designation of the city as a &quot;Festung&quot;. The Citadel was the last point to be taken, and the fighting left much of the city, particularly the Old Town, in ruins. Many monuments were also destroyed, including Gutzon Borglum&#x27;s statue of Woodrow Wilson in Poznan.

===1945–present===
Due to the expulsion and flight of German population Poznań&#x27;s post-war population became almost uniformly Polish. The city again became a voivodeship capital. In 1950, the size of Poznań Voivodeship was reduced, and the city itself was given separate voivodeship status. This status was lost in the 1975 reforms, which also significantly reduced the size of Poznań Voivodeship.
The Poznań 1956 protests are seen as an early instance of discontent with communist rule. In June 1956, a protest by workers at the city&#x27;s Cegielski locomotive factory developed into a series of strikes and popular protests against the policies of the government. After a protest march on 28 June was fired on, crowds attacked the communist party and secret police headquarters, where they were repulsed by gunfire. Riots continued for two days until being quelled by the army; 67 people were killed according to official figures. A monument to the victims was erected in 1981 at Plac Mickiewicza.

The post-war years had seen much reconstruction work on buildings damaged in the fighting. From the 1960s onwards intensive housing development took place, consisting mainly of pre-fabricated concrete blocks of flats, especially in Rataje and Winogrady, and later Piątkowo, following its incorporation into the city in 1974. Another infrastructural change, which was completed in 1968, was the rerouting of the river Warta to follow two straight branches either side of Ostrów Tumski.

The most recent expansion of the city&#x27;s boundaries took place in 1987, with the addition of new areas mainly to the north, including Morasko, Radojewo and Kiekrz. The first free local elections following the fall of communism took place in 1990. With the Polish local government reforms of 1999, Poznań again became the capital of a larger province entitled Greater Poland Voivodeship. It also became the seat of a &quot;powiat&quot; Poznań County, with the city itself gaining separate &quot;powiat&quot; status.

Post-communism infrastructural developments include the opening of the &quot;Pestka&quot; Fast Tram route in 1997, and Poznań&#x27;s first motorway connections in 2003 as Poland&#x27;s east–west A2 highway runs south of the city centre, serving also as a bypass. In 2006 country&#x27;s first F-16 Fighting Falcons came to be stationed at the 31st Air Base in Krzesiny in the south-east of the city.

Poznań continues to host regular trade fairs and international events, including the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2008. It was one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2012.

==Geography==

===Location and topography===

Poznań covers an area of , and has coordinates in the range 52°17&#x27;34&quot;–52°30&#x27;27&quot;N, 16°44&#x27;08&quot;–17°04&#x27;28&quot;E. Its highest point, with an altitude of , is the summit of Morasko hill within the Morasko meteorite nature reserve in the north of the city. The lowest altitude is , in the Warta valley.

Poznań&#x27;s main river is the Warta, which flows through the city from south to north. As it approaches the city centre it divides into two branches, flowing west and east of Ostrów Tumski Cathedral island, and meeting again further north. The smaller Cybina river flows through eastern Poznań to meet the east branch of the Warta, which is also called Cybina – its northern section was originally a continuation of that river, while its southern section has been artificially widened to form a main stream of the Warta. Other tributaries of the Warta within Poznań are the Junikowo Stream &quot;(Strumień Junikowski)&quot;, which flows through southern Poznań from the west, meeting the Warta just outside the city boundary in Luboń; the Bogdanka and Wierzbak, formerly two separate tributaries flowing from the north-west and along the north side of the city centre, now with their lower sections diverted underground; the Główna, flowing through the neighbourhood of the same name in north-east Poznań; and the Rose Stream &quot;(Strumień Różany)&quot; flowing east from Morasko in the north of the city. The course of the Warta in central Poznań was formerly quite different from today: the main stream ran between Grobla and Chwaliszewo, which were originally both islands. The branch west of Grobla (the &quot;Zgniła Warta&quot; – &quot;rotten Warta&quot;) was filled in late in the 19th century, and the former main stream west of Chwaliszewo was diverted and filled in during the 1960s. This was done partly to prevent floods, which did serious damage to Poznań frequently throughout history.
Poznań&#x27;s largest lake is Kiekrz in the north-west end of the city. Other large lakes include Malta, an artificial lake formed in 1952 on the lower Cybina river, Strzeszyn on the Bogdanka, and Rusałka, an artificial lake formed in 1943 further down the Bogdanka river. The latter two are popular bathing places. Kiekrz lake is much used for sailing, while Malta is a competitive rowing and canoeing venue.

The city centre – including the Old Town, the former islands of Grobla and Chwaliszewo, the main street Święty Marcin and many other important buildings and districts – lies on the west side of the Warta. Opposite it between the two branches of the Warta is Ostrów Tumski, containing Cathedral and other ecclesiastical buildings, as well as housing and industrial facilities. Facing the cathedral on the east bank of the river is the historic district of Śródka. Large areas of apartment blocks, built from the 1960s onwards, include Rataje in the east, and Winogrady and Piątkowo north of the centre. Older residential and commercial districts include those of Wilda, Łazarz and Górczyn to the south, and Jeżyce to the west. There are also significant areas of forest within the city boundaries, particularly in the east adjoining Swarzędz, and around the lakes in the north-west.

For more details on Poznań&#x27;s geography, see the articles on its five main districts: Stare Miasto, Nowe Miasto, Jeżyce, Grunwald, and Wilda.
====Climate====
The climate of Poznań is within the transition zone between a humid continental and oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot; to &quot;Dfb&quot; although it just fits in the second in the 0 °C isotherm) and with relatively cold winters and warm summers. Snow is common in winter, when night-time temperatures are typically below zero. In summer temperatures may often reach . Annual rainfall is more than , among the lowest in Poland. The rainiest month is July, mainly due to short but intense cloudbursts and thunderstorms. The number of hours of sunshine are among the highest in the country. The warmest temperature was recorded on 11 July 1959 at 


==Administration==
===Government and politics===

The city of Poznań, serving as the administrative center of the Greater Poland Voivodeship, houses both the Voivode of Greater Poland and the Marshal of Greater Poland. Poznań, which holds the status of both a municipality and a county city, is home not only to the local authorities of Poznań but also to the authorities of the Poznań County. Additionally, the city hosts the[Union of Polish Cities and the Association of Municipalities and Counties of Greater Poland.

The Poznań City Council is the legislative and supervisory body, elected for a four-year term. The current council members were elected in 2023. The council consists of 37 members. The Chairman of the Poznań City Council is Grzegorz Ganowicz (KO), and the Vice-Chairpersons are Przemysław Alexandrowicz (PiS), Agnieszka Lewandowska (KO), and Halina Owsianna. The council members collaborate within 14 permanent committees.
The office of the President of Poznań is held by Jacek Jaśkowiak, with the Deputy Presidents being Mariusz Wiśniewski, Jędrzej Solarski, and Natalia Weremczuk. The position of City Treasurer is occupied by Barbara Sajnaj, while Stanisław Tamm serves as the City Secretary.

Administrative services for citizens are managed by 30 departments and equivalent organizational units of the City of Poznań Office. Additionally, the city operates 328 municipal organizational units to fulfill various public tasks. Throughout the year, the departments of the City of Poznań Office and municipal administrative units issue approximately 565,000 administrative decisions.

===Administrative division===

Poznań is divided into 42 neighbourhoods called &quot;osiedle&quot;, each of which has its own elected council with certain decision-making and spending powers. The first uniform elections for these councils covering the whole area of the city were held on 20 March 2011.

For certain administrative purposes, the old division into five districts called &quot;dzielnica&quot; is used – although they ceased to be governmental units in 1990. These are:
* Stare Miasto (Old Town), population 161,200, area , covering the central and northern parts of the city
* Nowe Miasto (New Town), population 141,424, area , including all parts of the city on the east bank of the Warta
* Grunwald, population 125,500, area , covering the south-western parts of the city
* Jeżyce, population 81,300, area , covering the north-western parts of the city
* Wilda, population 62,290, area , in the southern part of the city

Many citizens of Poznań thanks to the strong economy of the city and high salaries started moving to suburbs of the Poznań County (powiat) in the 1990s. Although the number of inhabitants in Poznań itself was decreasing for the past two decades, the suburbs gained almost twice as many inhabitants. The Poznań metropolitan area &quot;Metropolia Poznań&quot; comprising Poznań County and several other communities is home to over 1 million inhabitants. The complex infrastructure, population density, number of companies and gross product per capita of Poznań suburbs may be only compared to Warsaw suburbs. Many parts of closer suburbs such as Tarnowo Podgorne, Komorniki, Suchy Las, and Dopiewo produce more in terms of GDP per capita than the city itself.

==Architecture==
===Gothic===

The relocation of Poznań from the right to the left bank of the Warta River occurred in the mid-13th century, during the height of the Gothic architecture. This significant urban shift led to the preservation of numerous Gothic structures, both religious and secular, on both sides of the Warta River, within the area of the former chartered town. The Gothic style in Poznań flourished from approximately the mid-13th century to the end of the 15th century.

Notable Gothic sites in the older, right-bank part of the city include:
*Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary (in summo) – erected on the site of a former princely palatium, this church originally housed a chapel founded around 965. The present structure was developed in several phases, with the nave constructed in the first half of the 15th century.
*Church of Saint John of Jerusalem outside the walls – built by the Knights Hospitaller at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, it is among the earliest brick churches in Poland.
*Church of St. Margaret – dating from the late 12th century, this church served the religious needs of Śródka, then the most populous area of the Poznań settlement complex. The Baroque interior, largely created in the 17th century, harmonizes with the Gothic architecture.
*Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul on Ostrów Tumski – as the most significant Catholic church in Poznań, this 14th-century cathedral has undergone multiple reconstructions, including a post-World War II regothicization.
In the left-bank part of the city, the most prominent Gothic monuments include:
*Church of St. Adalbert – a three-nave pseudo-basilica, built on a rectangular trapezoidal plan, located on St. Adalbert&#x27;s Hill.
*Church of Our Lady Help of Christians and Salesian Monastery – inside, above the presbytery, a unique type of Gothic rib vaulting, known as the Piast vault, can be found, while the northern nave features a star vault.
*Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Our Lady of Consolation – the oldest surviving church on the left bank of Warta.
*Church of St. Martin – likely constructed by Duke Przemysł I in 1240.
*Church of Corpus Christi and former Carmelite Monastery – the largest Gothic church in Poznań after the cathedral, this site was a major pilgrimage destination in the Middle Ages. The current form of the church and monastery resulted from reconstruction work between 1465 and 1470.

===Renaissance and Baroque===
The introduction of the Renaissance and Baroque architecture to Poznań resulted in the construction of many grand buildings. Noteworthy among these is the Town Hall, an exemplary piece of Renaissance architecture in Poland. The Town Hall underwent a significant reconstruction in the mid-16th century, after a fire in 1536. The city authorities entrusted the reconstruction to Giovanni Battista Quadro from Lugano in 1550. He expanded the building westward by approximately 11 meters and added an additional floor. The reconstruction was completed in 1560. The Renaissance Town Hall is characterized by its rectangular plan, three-story loggia on the facade, and three polygonal turrets. The central turret houses a clock mechanism featuring goats, a popular attraction in Poznań since 1551. The attic frieze depicts Jagiellonian kings, while the blind arcades feature rulers from the Piast dynasty.

From the Baroque period, the Poznań Fara or Collegiate Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, St. Mary Magdalene, and St. Stanislaus Bishop stands out as one of the most significant Baroque structures in Poland. The construction of this church began in the mid-17th century under the guidance of prominent Baroque architects such as Giovanni Catenazzi, Tomasz Poncino, and Pompeo Ferrari. The church was finally consecrated in 1705, although it was not fully completed at the time.

Other significant examples of Baroque architecture include the Jesuit College, the Basilica of St. Joseph and the Carmelite Monastery, the Church of St. Francis Seraph, commonly known as the Bernardine Church, and the Church of St. Casimir.
===Art Nouveau===

The early 20th-century expansion of Poznań to include Jeżyce, Wilda, and Łazarz facilitated the development of new architectural spaces. The demolition of the city&#x27;s fortifications also allowed for the construction of permanent buildings on former fortress grounds. During this period, numerous new urban developments and residential complexes were established.

One of them is the so-called Johow-Gelände in the Łazarz district, based on an urban concept by Max Johow, one of the leading architects in Poznań at the beginning of the 20th century. The tenement houses, built in a dense layout without backyards, were preceded by front gardens and, in addition to the high standard of the apartments, also impressed with richly decorated entrance halls and varied building facades. Numerous Art Nouveau tenement houses can also be found on neighboring streets such as Matejki, Wyspiańskiego, and Małeckiego.
In the early 20th century, many residential developments also emerged in the Jeżyce district, including a complex of villa-style tenements on Roosevelta Street, designed by the architectural firm of Herman Böhmer and Paul Preul for the German Civil Servants&#x27; Housing Cooperative. Particularly noteworthy are the wrought iron grilles at 5 Roosevelta Street and the oversized bas-relief of a naked woman supporting the balcony on the facade of building number 4. Nearby there is also the New Theatre, constructed in 1906, designed by the same architects, which facade design reflects Art Nouveau typical of the German region, featuring geometric forms with varied colors and textures. Similar architecture can be found in the central part of Jeżyce, along streets such as Dąbrowskiego, Kraszewskiego, Mickiewicza, Prusa, and Słowackiego.

Among the notable Art Nouveau structures are Oskar Hoffman&#x27;s tenement house at 69 Święta Marcin Street or tenement house at 14 Wolności Square.

===Imperial District===

The Imperial District, also known as the Imperial Forum, was constructed as a prestigious area of Poznań in the early 20th century. The district&#x27;s creation was driven by the need to improve the city&#x27;s spatial development, which had been hindered by existing fortifications. In 1902, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to abandon the concept of Poznań as a fortress city and to redevelop it in a residential style. In 1903, architect Josef Stübben presented a plan for the construction of a new district in the area of the demolished Berlin Gate (located at the intersection of today&#x27;s Święty Marcin and Kościuszki streets), which was realized between 1904 and 1910.

The central point of this district is the Imperial Castle, built between 1905 and 1910 for Wilhelm II. Over the years, the Castle&#x27;s purpose has evolved. During the interwar period, university lectures were held in its halls, during World War II, the building was adapted to serve as Hitler&#x27;s headquarters, and since the 1960s, it has functioned as a cultural center. Inside, one can find the Pałacowe Cinema, a modern concert hall, exhibition spaces, a library, a bookstore, a café, educational rooms, and areas for visitors to explore the castle&#x27;s historical rooms.

The heart of the district is Adam Mickiewicz Square, featuring a monument to the poet. At the boundary of the square and Adam Mickiewicz Park there is a monument commemorating the Victims of June 1956. The district&#x27;s buildings are located around the square and along Święty Marcin and Fredry streets.

In addition to the Imperial Castle, the most important buildings in the Imperial District include:
The Municipal Theater – now the Grand Theater, 1910, architect Max Littmann – inspired by the Villa Rotonda in Vicenza,
* Collegium Maius (formerly the Colonization Commission), 1908-1910, with a monument to the founder of the Polish university, Professor Heliodor Święcicki, in front of the building,
* Adolf Landsberg&#x27;s Villa, 1911,
* Institute of Hygiene, 1912,
* Collegium Minus, 1905-1910,
* Music Academy (formerly the Evangelical House – Evangelisches Vereinhaus), 1907–1908,
* Collegium Iuridicum (formerly the Raiffeisen Cooperative Bank), 1907
* Poznań Philharmonic, 1910,
* Post Office Directorate, 1910.

To the west, the district is enclosed by a semicircular line of parks that were created on the site of the 19th-century fortifications of Poznań Fortress. In the following years, an informal university district developed to the south of the Imperial District, featuring buildings of the Music Academy, the University of Economics, and Adam Mickiewicz University.

===Modernism===

Modern architecture in Poznań began to emerge in the 1930s with buildings like the ZUS office on Dąbrowskiego Street, continuing through the 1980s. The Okrąglak, constructed between 1949 and 1954, is a prominent example, designed by architect Marek Leykam. Built on a circular plan using prefabricated elements, its nine-story cylindrical structure features a flat roof with a central skylight and a surrounding terrace. The facade, without a dominant elevation, is characterized by a glass surface divided by rectangular window openings and vertical &quot;razor blade&quot; partitions.

Other examples of modernist architecture in Poznań include the Alfa Towers on Święty Marcin and the Poznan University of Physical Education building on Królowej Jadwigi Street. Another important modernist monument is the Arena Hall, which was built in 1974 and was inspired by the shape of the Palazzetto dello Sport, a hall constructed in Rome several years earlier.

===Contemporary Architecture===

The development of postmodernism in Poznań began at the start of the 21st century, primarily influencing office architecture. One of the most acclaimed buildings, which has received numerous awards, is Bałtyk — a 16-story office tower located near Rondo Kaponiera. This project marked the first realization in Poland by one of the world&#x27;s most renowned architectural firms, MVRDV. The unique form of the building gives it a different appearance from every angle — it appears to expand or contract, simultaneously slender and expansive. Other notable examples of modern architecture include the Porta Posnania, the Andersia office complex, Pixel, and the Nowy Rynek office complex.

A significant trend in the city&#x27;s architecture is the modernization of historical buildings and their integration with contemporary elements, exemplified by Stary Browar. This complex was developed on the site of the 19th-century Hugger Brewery. The shopping center largely consists of new forms, styled to resemble historical ones and based on the iconography of 19th-century industrial architecture.

==Culture and heritage==

Poznań possesses many historic buildings and heritage sites, mostly concentrated around the Old Town and other parts of the city centre. Many of these lie on the tourist Royal-Imperial Route – a walk leading through the most important parts of the city showing its history, culture and identity. Parts of the city centre are listed as one of Poland&#x27;s official national historic monuments, as designated 28 November 2008, along with other portions of the city&#x27;s historic core. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland.

Apart from traditional theatres with a long history such as &quot;Teatr Wielki&quot;, &quot;Teatr Polski&quot;, &quot;Teatr Nowy&quot;, and others like &quot;Teatr Animacji&quot;, &quot;Teatr Muzyczny&quot; and Polish Dance Theatre, Poznań is also home to a growing number of different kind of alternative theatre groups. It is believed that even up to 30 more or less known groups may work in the city, and thus, the city has recently become a new Polish off-theatre performance centre.
Classical music events include the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition which is held every 5 years, and classical music concerts by the Poznań Philharmonic orchestra held each month in the Hall of the Adam Mickiewicz University, considered to be one of the best in terms of acoustics in Poland. Especially popular are concerts by the Poznań Nightingales.

Poznań was one of the earliest centre of hip-hop and rap music. Most have been strongly linked to the Lech supporter scene and the club prominently features in their music. Arguably the most famous, Peja, was an ardent supporter since he was 15 years old, and was active in the hooligan scene in the 90s. Evtis, Ascetoholix, Bzyk and DJ Decks are all prominent supporters. The fans have produced recorded and released two rap CD&#x27;s called &quot;Definicja Kibol&quot; and &quot;Definicja Kibol 2&quot; as compilation of various artists.

Other rappers include duo Pięć Dwa, , Paluch, and .

Other contemporary notable local musicians include Adam Nowak, the co-founder and leader of the band Raz, Dwa, Trzy; pop singer Sylwia Grzeszczak; rock band Pidżama Porno; and DJ duo Kalwi &amp; Remi.
Every year on 11 November, city residents celebrate the Day of St. Martin. A procession of horses, with Saint Martin at its head, parades along Saint Martin Street (&quot;ulica Święty Marcin&quot;), in front of the Imperial Castle. The renowned St. Martin&#x27;s Croissant, a regional product of Poznań, are widely sold during the festivities.

Since the year 2000, Poznań has hosted &quot;Betlejem Poznańskie&quot; a cultural and entertainment event associated with the Advent season and Christmas. The event begins with the onset of Advent and concludes on December 23. The central attraction is a live nativity scene featuring real animals, accompanied by a large stage where musical concerts, competitions, and various artistic and entertainment activities take place. Surrounding the nativity scene are numerous stalls offering handcrafted goods, regional products, traditional foods, mulled wine, and hot meals. The ambiance is reminiscent of German Christmas markets, known as Weihnachtsmarkte. In addition to the permanent attractions, &quot;Betlejem Poznańskie&quot; includes recurring events such as carol singing reviews, the election of the Poznań &quot;Gwiazdor&quot; (a fictional character who distributes gifts on Christmas Eve, appearing in Greater Poland&#x27;s tradition), art workshops, city games, and more.

A highlight is the International Ice Sculpture Festival, held annually since 2006. The event also features the &quot;Betlejemskie Światło Pokoju&quot; (Bethlehem Light of Peace) brought from the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. During this time, city officials, the consular corps, and rectors of Poznań&#x27;s universities exchange festive greetings.

An important cultural event in Poznań is the annual Malta Festival, which takes place at many city venues, usually in late June and early July. It hosts mainly modern experimental off-theatre performances often taking place on squares and other public spaces. It also includes cinema, visual, music and dancing events. Poznań also stages the Ale Kino! International Young Audience Film Festival in December, and Off Cinema festival of independent films. Other festivals: Animator (animated film festival), Ethno Port festival of traditional world&#x27;s ethnic music, Maski Theater Festival, Dance International Workshops by Polish Dance Theater, Made in Chicago (jazz festival), Festival of Ice Sculpture, Science and Art Festival, Tzadik (Jewish music festival), and Meditations Biennale (modern art).

Poznań has several museums as well as cinemas, including multiplexes and art-house institutions. The Rozbrat social centre, a squatted former factory in Jeżyce, serves as a home for independent and open-minded culture. It hosts frequent gigs, an anarchist library, vernissages, exhibitions, annual birthday festival in October, poetry evenings and graffiti festivals. The city centre has many clubs, pubs and coffee houses.

A popular venue is &quot;Malta&quot;, a park with an artificial lake situated in its centre. On one south bank of the lake there are ski and sleigh slopes of Malta Ski centre, and on the opposite bank a large complex of &quot;Termy Maltańskie&quot; swimming pools.

Poznań Zoological Garden has two facilities. The Old Zoo is one of the oldest in Poland, established in 1874 just west of the city centre. The large New Zoo was opened to the public in 1974, becoming second largest in Poland in terms of area. It is located on a hilly forest area with six large ponds at the eastern city&#x27;s wedge of greenery, beyond the Malta lake. There is a dedicated and adored by children &quot;Maltanka&quot; mini-railway, that starts the route near the &quot;Śródka&quot; roundabout.

==Economy==
Poznań has been an important trade centre since the Middle Ages. Starting in the 19th century, local heavy industry began to grow. Several major factories were built, including the Hipolit Cegielski&#x27;s steel mill and railway factory, popularly called &quot;Ceglorz&quot;.

Nowadays, Poznań is one of the major trade centres in Poland. It is regarded as the second most prosperous city in Poland after its capital Warsaw. The city of Poznań produced PLN 31.8 billion of Poland&#x27;s gross domestic product in 2006.

Many European companies have established their Polish headquarters in Poznań or in nearby towns such as Tarnowo Podgórne and Swarzędz. Most foreign investors are German (36%) and Dutch companies (14%). The best known examples of corporation who have their headquarters in Poznań and the surrounding areas are that of Volkswagen, GlaxoSmithKline, Amazon, Bridgestone, Beiersdorf, Raben Group (near Kórnik) and Kuehne + Nagel (near Gądki). There are also several shared services centers, and IT branch offices. Investors are mostly from the food processing, furniture, automotive and transport and logistics industries. Foreign companies are primarily attracted by relatively low labour costs, good road and railway network, good vocational skills of workers, and relatively liberal employment laws.

Some of the best-known major corporations founded and still based in Poznań and the city&#x27;s metropolitan area include Allegro – owner of the Poland&#x27;s biggest e-commerce site, H. Cegielski-Poznań SA – a historic manufacturer, Solaris Bus &amp; Coach – a modern bus and coach maker based in Bolechowo, and Enea S.A. – one of the country&#x27;s biggest energy firms. Kompania Piwowarska based in Poznań produces some of Poland&#x27;s best known beers, and includes not only the local Lech Brewery&#x27;s products but also Tyskie from Tychy and Dojlidy Brewery from Białystok among many others.

In 2008, three Poznań students founded Netguru, a software development and digital consultancy company. It grew fast to employ about 600 people in 2019.

&quot;Stary Browar&quot;, the center of commerce and art opened in 2003, won several awards for its architecture. Other notable shopping centers include &quot;Posnania&quot;, the biggest commerce facility in Greater Poland, &quot;Galeria Malta&quot;, and the shops at the Hotel Bazar – a historical hotel and commercial center in the Old Town.

==Population==
In 1600, approximately 20,000 inhabitants resided in the whole Poznań conurbation. By 1732 the population had dropped to 4,000 due to wars, floods and plague. Historically, its growth rate was high throughout the 19th and 20th centuries; in the year 1900 approximately 110,000 people were registered as residents and by 1939 there was already 274,155 people. The population of Poznań has declined steadily since 1990, when it reached a maximum of 590,101. This phenomenon, which also affected other European cities, is caused in part by the growth of satellite suburbs at the expense of the downtown region within the city proper. In 2020, Poznań had 532,048 registered inhabitants being the fifth most populous town in Poland, while the metropolitan area had a population of about 1,000,000 people. The city&#x27;s population density was .

Contemporary Poznań has one of the highest concentration of foreigners in Poland alongside Warsaw and Wrocław; a significant majority are migrant workers from Ukraine; others came from Italy, Spain, Belarus, Russia and Serbia. No exact statistic exists on the number of temporary residents from abroad. Many are students studying at Poznań&#x27;s schools and institutions of higher learning.

==Education and science==

Poznań is one of the four largest academic centres in Poland. The number of students in the city is about 140,000, which ranks it the third or fourth after Warsaw and Kraków and about equal to Wrocław in student population. Every one in four inhabitants of Poznań is a student. Since Poznań is smaller than Warsaw or Kraków still having a very large number of students it makes the city even more vibrant and dense academic hub than both former and current capital of Poland – Kraków and Warsaw respectively. Poznań with its almost 30 universities and colleges has the second richest educational offering in the country after Warsaw.

===Public universities===
The city has eight state-owned universities. Adam Mickiewicz University (&quot;UAM&quot;) is one of the most influential and biggest universities in Poland. Poznań University of Technology (PUT, &quot;PP&quot; in Polish) is one of the most influential and biggest technical universities in Poland.

The majority of faculties are already open, although a few more facilities will be constructed. The campus infrastructure belongs to the most impressive among Polish universities. Also, there are plans for &quot;Uniwersytecki Park Historii Ziemii&quot; (Earth History Park), one of the reason for the park construction is a &quot;Morasko meteorite nature reserve&quot; situated close by, it is one of the rare sites of Europe where a number of meteorites fell and some traces may be still seen.

Poznań University of Technology was ranked fifth among all universities in Poland, and third among Polish technical universities, in the 2018 international Scimago Institutions Ranking. In the 2019 Academic Ranking of World Universities, known also as the Shanghai Ranking, PUT was classified among the 500 best universities in the world in two disciplines, i.e. &quot;Computer Science &amp; Engineering&quot; and &quot;Mechanical Engineering&quot;. PUT was ranked third among all Polish universities in the 2019–20 Ministry of Science and Higher Education popularity ranking. Recent years have brought extensive development of university infrastructure at the &quot;Warta campus&quot;, located on the right side of Warta river between Malta lake and Poznań city center. Location of this campus belongs to the most impressive among Polish universities.

At the regional level, the Voivodship Police Headquarters in Poznań (Komenda Wojewódzka Policji w Poznaniu, KWP) coordinates police activities across the entire Greater Poland Voivodeship. Within the city, the key role is played by the Municipal Police Headquarters in Poznań (Komenda Miejska Policji w Poznaniu, KMP), responsible for maintaining order and safety.

<text>Peter Michael Falk (September 16, 1927 – June 23, 2011) was an American film and television actor, singer and television director and producer. He is best known for his role as Lieutenant Columbo on the NBC/ABC series &quot;Columbo&quot; (1968–1978, 1989–2003), for which he won four Primetime Emmy Awards (1972, 1975, 1976, 1990) and a Golden Globe Award (1973). In 1996, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Falk No. 21 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list. He received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2013.

He first starred as Columbo in two 2-hour &quot;World Premiere&quot; TV pilots; the first with Gene Barry in 1968 and the second with Lee Grant in 1971. The show then aired as part of &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot; series from 1971 to 1978, and again on ABC from 1989 to 2003.

Falk was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot; (1960) and &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; (1961), and won his first Emmy Award in 1962 for &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;. He was the first actor to be nominated for an Academy Award and an Emmy Award in the same year, achieving the feat twice (1961 and 1962). He went on to appear in such films as &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965), &quot;Anzio&quot; (1968), &quot;Murder by Death&quot; (1976), &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978), &quot;The Brink&#x27;s Job&quot; (1978), &quot;The In-Laws &quot;(1979), &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987), &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1987), &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), and &quot;Next&quot; (2007), as well as many television guest roles.

Falk was also known for his collaborations with filmmaker, actor, and personal friend John Cassavetes, acting in films such as &quot;Husbands&quot; (1970), &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; (1974), Elaine May&#x27;s &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot; (1976) and the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Étude in Black&quot; (1972).

==Early life==

Born in The Bronx, New York City, Falk was the son of Michael Peter Falk, owner of a clothing and dry goods store, and his wife, Madeline (née Hochhauser). Both his parents were Jewish.

Falk&#x27;s right eye was surgically removed when he was three because of a retinoblastoma. He wore an artificial eye for most of his life. The artificial eye was the cause of his trademark squint. Despite this limitation, as a boy he participated in team sports, mainly baseball and basketball. In a 1997 interview in &quot;Cigar Aficionado&quot; magazine with Arthur Marx, Falk said: 
Falk&#x27;s first stage appearance was at age 12 in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; at Camp High Point in upstate New York, where one of his camp counselors was Ross Martin. Falk attended Ossining High School in Westchester County, New York, where he was a star athlete and president of his senior class. He graduated in 1945.

Falk briefly attended Hamilton College in Clinton, New York. He then tried to join the armed services, as World War II was drawing to a close. Rejected because of his missing eye, he joined the United States Merchant Marine and served as a cook and mess boy. Falk said of the experience in 1997: &quot;There they don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re blind or not. The only one on a ship who has to see is the captain. And in the case of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, he couldn&#x27;t see very well, either.&quot; Falk recalled in his autobiography: 
After a year and a half in the Merchant Marine, Falk returned to Hamilton College and also attended the University of Wisconsin. He transferred to The New School for Social Research in New York City, which awarded him a bachelor&#x27;s degree in literature and political science in 1951.

Falk traveled in Europe and worked on a railroad in Yugoslavia for six months. He returned to New York, enrolling at Syracuse University, but he recalled in his 2006 memoir, &quot;Just One More Thing&quot;, that he was unsure what he wanted to do with his life for years after leaving high school. Falk obtained a Master of Public Administration degree at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University in 1953. The program was designed to train civil servants for the federal government, a career that Falk said in his memoir he had &quot;no interest in and no aptitude for.&quot;

==Career==
===Early career===
He applied for a job with the CIA, but he was rejected because of his membership in the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union while serving in the Merchant Marine, even though he was required to join and was not active in the union (which had been under fire for communist leanings). He then became a management analyst with the Connecticut State Budget Bureau in Hartford. In 1997, Falk characterized his Hartford job as &quot;efficiency expert&quot;: &quot;I was such an efficiency expert that the first morning on the job, I couldn&#x27;t find the building where I was to report for work. Naturally, I was late, which I always was in those days, but ironically it was my tendency never to be on time that got me started as a professional actor.&quot;

===Stage career===

While working in Hartford, Falk joined a community theater group called the Mark Twain Masquers, where he performed in plays that included &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, and &quot;The Country Girl&quot; by Clifford Odets. Falk also studied with Eva Le Gallienne, who was giving an acting class at the White Barn Theatre in Westport, Connecticut. Falk later recalled how he &quot;lied his way&quot; into the class, which was for professional actors. He drove down to Westport from Hartford every Wednesday, when the classes were held, and was usually late. In his 1997 interview with Arthur Marx in &quot;Cigar Aficionado&quot; Magazine, Falk said of Le Gallienne: &quot;One evening when I arrived late, she looked at me and asked, &#x27;Young man, why are you always late?&#x27; and I said, &#x27;I have to drive down from Hartford.&#x27;&quot; She looked down her nose and said, &quot;What do you do in Hartford? There&#x27;s no theater there. How do you make a living acting?&quot; Falk confessed he was not a professional actor. According to him Le Gallienne looked at him sternly and said: &quot;Well, you should be.&quot; He drove back to Hartford and quit his job. Falk stayed with the Le Gallienne group for a few months more, and obtained a letter of recommendation from Le Galliene to an agent at the William Morris Agency in New York. In 1956, he left his job with the Budget Bureau and moved to Greenwich Village to pursue an acting career.

Falk&#x27;s first New York stage role was in an off-Broadway production of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot; at the Fourth Street Theatre that closed after its only performance on January 3, 1956. Falk played the second lead, Sganarelle. His next theater role proved far better for his career. In May, he appeared as Rocky Pioggi at Circle in the Square in a revival of &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; directed by Jose Quintero, with Jason Robards playing the lead role of Theodore &quot;Hickey&quot; Hickman.

Later in 1956, Falk made his Broadway debut, appearing in Alexander Ostrovsky&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Scoundrel&quot;. As the year came to an end, he appeared again on Broadway as an English soldier in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot; with Siobhán McKenna. Falk continued to act in summer stock theater productions, including a staging of Arnold Schulman&#x27;s &quot;A Hole in the Head&quot;, at the Colonie Summer Theatre (near Albany, NY) in July 1962; it starred Priscilla Morrill.

In 1972, Falk appeared in Broadway&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot;. According to film historian Ephraim Katz: &quot;His characters derive added authenticity from his squinty gaze, the result of the loss of an eye...&quot; However, this production caused Falk a great deal of stress, both on and offstage. He struggled with memorizing a short speech, spending hours trying to memorize three lines. The next day at rehearsal, he reported feeling a strange &quot;tingling&quot; sensation in his neck and acting oddly. This caught the attention of a stage manager, who told him to go &quot;take a Valium&quot;. Only later did Falk realize he was having an anxiety attack. He would not go on to perform in any other plays, citing both this incident and his preference for acting in film and television productions.

===Early films===

Despite his stage success, a theatrical agent advised Falk not to expect much film acting work because of his artificial eye. He failed a screen test at Columbia Pictures and was told by studio boss Harry Cohn: &quot;For the same price I can get an actor with two eyes.&quot; He also failed to get a role in the film &quot;Marjorie Morningstar&quot;, despite a promising interview for the second lead. His first film performances were in small roles in &quot;Wind Across the Everglades&quot; (1958), &quot;The Bloody Brood&quot; (1959), and &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; (1960). Falk&#x27;s performance in &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot; (1960) was a turning point in his career. He was cast in the supporting role of killer Abe Reles in a film based on the real-life murder gang of that name who terrorized New York in the 1930s. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther, while dismissing the movie as &quot;an average gangster film,&quot; singled out Falk&#x27;s &quot;amusingly vicious performance.&quot; Crowther wrote:

The film turned out to be Falk&#x27;s breakout role. In his autobiography, &quot;Just One More Thing&quot; (2006), Falk said his selection for the film from thousands of other Off-Broadway actors was a &quot;miracle&quot; that &quot;made my career&quot; and that without it, he would not have received the other significant movie roles that he later played. Falk, who played Reles again in the 1960 TV series &quot;The Witness&quot;, was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his performance in the film.

In 1961, multiple Academy Award-winning director Frank Capra cast Falk in the comedy &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot;. The film was Capra&#x27;s last feature, and although it was not the commercial success he hoped it would be, he &quot;gushed about Falk&#x27;s performance.&quot; Falk was nominated for an Oscar for the role. In his autobiography, Capra wrote about Falk:
For his part, Falk says he &quot;never worked with a director who showed greater enjoyment of actors and the acting craft. There is nothing more important to an actor than to know that the one person who represents the audience to you, the director, is responding well to what you are trying to do.&quot; Falk once recalled how Capra reshot a scene even though he yelled &quot;Cut and Print,&quot; indicating the scene was finalized. When Falk asked him why he wanted it reshot: &quot;He laughed and said that he loved the scene so much he just wanted to see us do it again. How&#x27;s that for support!&quot;

For the remainder of the 1960s, Falk had mainly supporting movie roles and TV guest-starring appearances. Falk portrayed one of two cabbies who falls victim to greed in the epic 1963 star-studded comedy &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, although he appears only in the last fifth of the movie. His other roles included the character of Guy Gisborne in the Rat Pack musical comedy &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; (1964), in which he sings one of the film&#x27;s numbers, and the spoof &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965) with Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis.

===Early television roles===

Falk first appeared on television in 1957, in the dramatic anthology programs that later became known as the &quot;Golden Age of Television&quot;. In 1957, he appeared in one episode of &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents.&quot; He was also cast in &quot;Studio One,&quot; &quot;Kraft Television Theater,&quot; &quot;New York Confidential,&quot; &quot;Naked City,&quot; &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Have Gun–Will Travel,&quot; &quot;The Islanders,&quot; and &quot;Decoy&quot; with Beverly Garland cast as the first female police officer in a series lead. Falk often portrayed unsavory characters on television during the early 1960s. In &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Mirror,&quot; Falk starred as a paranoid Castro-type revolutionary who, intoxicated with power, begins seeing would-be assassins in a mirror. He also starred in two of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s television series, as a gangster terrified of death in a 1961 episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and as a homicidal evangelist in 1962&#x27;s &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;.

In 1961, Falk was nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance in the episode &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; of James Whitmore&#x27;s short-lived series &quot;The Law and Mr. Jones&quot; on ABC. On September 29, 1961, Falk and Walter Matthau guest-starred in the premiere episode, &quot;The Million Dollar Dump&quot;, of ABC&#x27;s crime drama &quot;&quot;, with Stephen McNally and Robert Harland. He won an Emmy for &quot;The Price of Tomatoes,&quot; a drama carried in 1962 on &quot;The Dick Powell Show&quot;.

In 1961, Falk earned the distinction of becoming the first actor to be nominated for an Oscar and an Emmy in the same year. He received nominations for his supporting roles in &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot; and the television program &quot;The Law and Mr. Jones&quot;. Incredibly, Falk repeated this double nomination in 1962, being nominated again for a supporting actor role in &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; and best actor in &quot;The Price of Tomatoes,&quot; an episode of &quot;The Dick Powell Show&quot;, for which he took home the award.

In 1963, Falk and Tommy Sands appeared in &quot;The Gus Morgan Story&quot; on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot; as brothers who disagreed on the route for a railroad. Falk played the title role of &quot;Gus&quot;, and Sands was his younger brother, Ethan Morgan. After Ethan accidentally shoots wagonmaster Chris Hale, played by John McIntire, while in the mountains, Gus has to decide whether to rescue Hale or his brother (suffering from oxygen deprivation). This episode is remembered for its examination of how far a man will persist amid adversity to preserve his own life and that of his brother.

Having had many roles in film and television during the early 1960s, Falk&#x27;s first lead in a television series came with CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Trials of O&#x27;Brien&quot;. The show ran from 1965 to 1966, its 22 episodes featuring Falk as a Shakespeare-quoting lawyer who defends clients while solving mysteries. In 1966, he also co-starred in a television production of &quot;Brigadoon&quot; with Robert Goulet.

In 1971, Pierre Cossette produced the first Grammy Awards show on television with some help from Falk. Cossette writes in his autobiography, &quot;What meant the most to me, though, is the fact that Peter Falk saved my ass. I love show business, and I love Peter Falk.&quot;

===&quot;Columbo&quot;===
Although Falk appeared in numerous other television roles in the 1960s and 1970s, he is best known as the star of the TV series &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;everyone&#x27;s favorite rumpled television detective.&quot; His character, known for his catchphrase: &quot;Just one more thing,&quot; was a shabby and deceptively absent-minded police detective driving a Peugeot 403, who had first appeared in the 1968 film &quot;Prescription: Murder.&quot; &quot;Columbo&quot; was created by William Link and Richard Levinson. The show was of a type known as an inverted detective story; it typically revealed the murderer at the beginning, then showed how the Los Angeles homicide detective went about solving the crime. Falk would describe his role to film historian and author David Fantle:
Television critic Ben Falk (no relation) added that Falk &quot;created an iconic cop … who always got his man (or woman) after a tortuous cat-and-mouse investigation.&quot; He also noted the idea for the character was &quot;apparently inspired by Dostoyevsky&#x27;s dogged police inspector, Porfiry Petrovich, in the novel &quot;Crime and Punishment.&quot;&quot;

Peter Falk tries to analyze the character and notes the correlation between his own personality and Columbo&#x27;s:
With &quot;general amazement,&quot; Falk notes: &quot;The show is all over the world. I&#x27;ve been to little villages in Africa with maybe one TV set, and little kids will run up to me shouting, &#x27;Columbo, Columbo!&#x27;&quot; Singer Johnny Cash recalled acting in one episode (&quot;Swan Song&quot;), and although he was not an experienced actor, he writes in his autobiography, &quot;Peter Falk was good to me. I wasn&#x27;t at all confident about handling a dramatic role, and every day he helped me in all kinds of little ways.&quot;

The first episode of &quot;Columbo&quot; as a series was directed in 1971 by a 24-year-old Steven Spielberg in one of his earliest directing jobs. Falk recalled the episode to Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride:

The character of Columbo had previously been played by Bert Freed in a 1960 television episode of &quot;The Chevy Mystery Show&quot; (&quot;Enough Rope&quot;), and by Thomas Mitchell on Broadway. Falk first played Columbo in &quot;Prescription: Murder&quot;, a 1968 TV movie, and the 1970 pilot for the series, &quot;Ransom for a Dead Man&quot;. From 1971 to 1978, &quot;Columbo&quot; aired regularly on NBC as part of the umbrella series &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot;. All episodes were of TV movie length, in a 90- or 120-minute slot including commercials. In 1989, the show returned on ABC in the form of a less frequent series of TV movies, still starring Falk, airing until 2003. Falk won four Emmys for his role as Columbo.

&quot;Columbo&quot; was so popular, co-creator William Link wrote a series of short stories published as &quot;The Columbo Collection&quot; (Crippen &amp; Landru, 2010) which includes a drawing by Falk of himself as Columbo, while the cover features a caricature of Falk/Columbo by Al Hirschfeld.

Lieutenant Columbo owns a Basset Hound named Dog. Originally, it was not going to appear in the show because Peter Falk believed that it ‘already had enough gimmicks’ but once the two met, Falk stated that Dog &quot;was exactly the type of dog that Columbo would own&quot;, so he was added to the show and made his first appearance in 1972&#x27;s &quot;Étude In Black&quot;.

Columbo&#x27;s wardrobe was provided by Peter Falk; they were his own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in &quot;Prescription: Murder&quot;. Falk would often ad lib his character&#x27;s idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets for a piece of evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo&#x27;s antics more genuine. According to Levinson, the catchphrase &quot;one more thing&quot; was conceived when he and Link were writing the play: &quot;we had a scene that was too short, and we&#x27;d already had Columbo make his exit. We were too lazy to retype the scene, so we had him come back and say, &#x27;Oh, just one more thing . . .&#x27; It was never planned.&quot;

&quot;Columbo&quot; featured an unofficial signature tune, the children&#x27;s song &quot;This Old Man&quot;. It was introduced in the episode &quot;Any Old Port in a Storm&quot; in 1973 and the detective can be heard humming or whistling it often in subsequent films. Peter Falk admitted that it was a melody he enjoyed, and one day it became a part of his character. The tune was also used in various score arrangements throughout the three decades of the series, including opening and closing credits. A version of it, titled &quot;Columbo&quot;, was created by one of the show&#x27;s composers, Patrick Williams.

A few years prior to his death, Falk had expressed interest in returning to the role. In 2007, he said he had chosen a script for one last Columbo episode, &quot;Columbo: Hear No Evil&quot;. The script was renamed &quot;Columbo&#x27;s Last Case&quot;. ABC declined the project. In response, producers for the series attempted to shop the project to foreign production companies. However, Falk was diagnosed with dementia in late 2007. Falk died on June 23, 2011, aged 83.

Peter Falk won four Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Lieutenant Columbo in 1972, 1975, 1976 and 1990. Falk directed just one episode: &quot;Blueprint for Murder&quot; in 1971, although it is rumored that he and John Cassavetes were largely responsible for direction duties on &quot;Étude in Black&quot; in 1972. Falk&#x27;s own favorite &quot;Columbo&quot; episodes were &quot;Any Old Port in a Storm&quot;, &quot;Forgotten Lady&quot;, &quot;Now You See Him&quot; and &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;. Falk was rumored to be earning a record $300,000 per episode when he returned for Season 6 of &quot;Columbo&quot; in 1976. This doubled to $600,000 per episode when the series made its comeback in 1989. In 1997, &quot;Murder by the Book&quot; was ranked at No. 16 in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s &#x27;100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&#x27; list. Two years later, the magazine ranked Lieutenant Columbo No. 7 on its &#x27;50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time&#x27; list.

===Later career===
Falk was a close friend of independent film director John Cassavetes and appeared in his films &quot;Husbands&quot;, &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot;, and, in a cameo, at the end of &quot;Opening Night&quot;. Cassavetes guest-starred in the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Étude in Black&quot; in 1972; Falk, in turn, co-starred with Cassavetes in Elaine May&#x27;s film &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot; (1976). Falk describes his experiences working with Cassavetes, specifically remembering his directing strategies: &quot;Shooting an actor when he might be unaware the camera was running.&quot; 

In 1978, Falk appeared on the comedy TV show &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot;, portraying his Columbo character, with Frank Sinatra the evening&#x27;s victim. Director William Friedkin said of Falk&#x27;s role in his film &quot;The Brink&#x27;s Job&quot; (1978): &quot;Peter has a great range from comedy to drama. He could break your heart or he could make you laugh.&quot;

Falk continued to work in films, including his performance as an ex-CIA officer of questionable sanity in the comedy &quot;The In-Laws&quot;. Director Arthur Hiller said during an interview that the &quot;film started out because Alan Arkin and Peter Falk wanted to work together. They went to Warner Brothers and said, &#x27;We&#x27;d like to do a picture,&#x27; and Warner said fine ... and out came &quot;The In-laws&quot; ... of all the films I&#x27;ve done, &quot;The In-laws&quot; is the one I get the most comments on.&quot; Movie critic Roger Ebert compared the film with a later remake:
Falk appeared in &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, &quot;Murder by Death&quot;, &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot;, &quot;Vibes&quot;, &quot;Made&quot;, and in Wim Wenders&#x27; 1987 German language film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; and its 1993 sequel, &quot;Faraway, So Close!.&quot; In &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, Falk played a semi-fictionalized version of himself, a famous American actor who had once been an angel, but who had grown disillusioned with only observing life on Earth and had in turn given up his immortality. Falk described the role as &quot;the craziest thing that I&#x27;ve ever been offered&quot;, but he earned critical acclaim for his supporting performance in the film.

In 1998, Falk returned to the New York stage to star in an Off-Broadway production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Peters&#x27; Connections&quot;. His previous stage work included shady real estate salesman Shelley &quot;the Machine&quot; Levine in the 1986 Boston/Los Angeles production of David Mamet&#x27;s prizewinning &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;.

Falk starred in a trilogy of holiday television movies – &quot;A Town Without Christmas&quot; (2001), &quot;Finding John Christmas&quot; (2003), and &quot;When Angels Come to Town&quot; (2004) – in which he portrayed Max, a quirky guardian angel who uses disguises and subterfuge to steer his charges onto the right path. In 2005, he starred in &quot;The Thing About My Folks&quot;. Although movie critic Roger Ebert was not impressed with most of the other actors, he wrote in his review: &quot;... We discover once again what a warm and engaging actor Peter Falk is. I can&#x27;t recommend the movie, but I can be grateful that I saw it, for Falk.&quot; In 2007, Falk appeared with Nicolas Cage in the thriller &quot;Next&quot;.

Falk&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Just One More Thing&quot;, was published in 2006.

==Personal life==
Falk married Alyce Mayo, whom he met when the two were students at Syracuse University, on April 17, 1960. The couple adopted two daughters, Catherine (who became a private investigator) and Jackie. Falk and his wife divorced in 1976. On December 7, 1977, he married actress Shera Danese, who guest-starred in more episodes of the &quot;Columbo&quot; series than any other actress.

Falk was an accomplished artist, and in October 2006 he had an exhibition of his drawings at the Butler Institute of American Art. He took classes at the Art Students League of New York for many years.

Falk was a chess aficionado and a spectator at the American Open in Santa Monica, California, in November 1972, and at the U.S. Open in Pasadena, California, in August 1983.

His memoir &quot;Just One More Thing&quot; () was published by Carroll &amp; Graf on August 23, 2006.

===Health===
In December 2008, it was reported that Falk had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In June 2009, at a two-day conservatorship trial in Los Angeles, one of Falk&#x27;s personal physicians, Dr. Stephen Read, reported he had rapidly slipped into dementia after a series of dental operations in 2007. Dr. Read said it was unclear whether Falk&#x27;s condition had worsened as a result of anesthesia or some other reaction to the operations. Shera Danese Falk was appointed as her husband&#x27;s conservator.

==Death==
On the evening of June 23, 2011, Falk died at his longtime home on Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills at the age of 83. The causes of death were pneumonia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. His daughters said they would remember his &quot;wisdom and humor&quot;. He is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

His death was marked by tributes from many film celebrities including Jonah Hill and Stephen Fry. Steven Spielberg said, &quot;I learned more about acting from him at that early stage of my career than I had from anyone else&quot;. Rob Reiner said: &quot;He was a completely unique actor&quot;, and went on to say that Falk&#x27;s work with Alan Arkin in &quot;The In-Laws&quot; was &quot;one of the most brilliant comedy pairings we&#x27;ve seen on screen&quot;. His epitaph reads: &quot;I&#x27;m not here, I&#x27;m home with Shera.&quot;

===Peter Falk&#x27;s Law===
According to Falk&#x27;s daughter Catherine, his second wife Shera Danese (who also was his conservator) allegedly stopped some of his family members from visiting him; did not notify them of major changes in his condition; and did not notify them of his death and funeral arrangements. Catherine encouraged the passage in 2015 of legislation called colloquially &quot;Peter Falk&#x27;s Law&quot;. The new law was passed in New York state to protect children from being cut off from news of serious medical and end-of-life developments regarding their parents or from contact with them. The law provides guidelines regarding visitation rights and notice of death with which an incapacitated person&#x27;s guardians or conservators must comply.

As of 2020, more than fifteen states had enacted such laws. In introducing the measure, New York State Senator John DeFrancisco said, &quot;For every wrong there should be a remedy. This bill gives a remedy to children of elderly and infirm parents who have been cut off from receiving information about their parents. It also gives them an avenue through the courts to obtain visitation rights with the parents.&quot;

<doc id="23726" wikidata="Q188464" url="?curid=23726" title="Pixies (band)">
<text>The Pixies are an American alternative rock band from Boston, Massachusetts formed in 1986 by Black Francis (vocals, rhythm guitar, songwriter), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), Kim Deal (bass, vocals) and David Lovering (drums).

The Pixies are associated with the 1990s alternative rock boom, and draw on elements including punk rock and surf rock. Their music is known for dynamic &quot;loud-quiet-loud&quot; shifts and song structures. Francis is the primary songwriter; his often surreal lyrics cover offbeat subjects such as extraterrestrials, incest, and biblical violence. Their jarring pop sound influenced acts such as Nirvana, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, the Smashing Pumpkins and Weezer. 

The Pixies achieved modest popularity in the US but were more successful in Europe. Their popularity grew after their breakup, leading to a 2004 reunion and sold-out world tours. Deal left in 2013, and was replaced by Kim Shattuck as a touring bassist. She was replaced that year by Paz Lenchantin, who became a full member in 2016. With Lenchantin, the Pixies recorded the albums &quot;Head Carrier&quot; (2016), &quot;Beneath the Eyrie&quot; (2019) and &quot;Doggerel&quot; (2022). Lenchantin departed in 2024, replaced by Emma Richardson, formerly of Band of Skulls. The ninth Pixies album, &quot;The Night the Zombies Came,&quot; was released in October 2024.

== History ==

=== Formation (1986) ===
Guitarist Joey Santiago and songwriter Black Francis (born Charles Michael Kittridge Thompson IV) met when they lived next to each other in a suite while attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Although Santiago was worried about distractions, he noticed Francis played music and the pair began to jam together. Francis embarked on a student exchange trip to Puerto Rico to study Spanish. After six months, he returned to Amherst and dropped out of the university. Francis and Santiago spent 1984 working in a Boston-area warehouse, with Francis composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics on the subway train.

The pair formed a band in January 1986. Two weeks later, Francis placed an advertisement seeking a bass player who liked both the folk act Peter, Paul and Mary and the alternative rock band Hüsker Dü. Kim Deal was the only respondent, and arrived at the audition without a bass, as she had never played one before. She was invited to join as she liked the songs Francis showed her. She obtained a bass, and the trio started rehearsing in Deal&#x27;s apartment.

After recruiting Deal, Kim paid for her sister, Kelley Deal, to fly to Boston and audition as drummer. Though Francis approved, Kelley was not confident in her drumming, and was more interested in playing songs written by Kim; she later joined Kim&#x27;s band the Breeders. Kim&#x27;s husband suggested they hire David Lovering, whom Kim had met at her wedding reception. The group arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word &quot;pixies&quot; randomly from a dictionary, liking how it looked and its definition as &quot;mischievous little elves&quot;. The Pixies moved rehearsals to Lovering&#x27;s parents&#x27; garage in mid-1986 and began to play shows at bars in the Boston area.

=== &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; (1987) ===
While the Pixies were playing a concert with Throwing Muses, they were noticed by the producer Gary Smith, the manager of Fort Apache Studios. He told them he &quot;could not sleep until you guys are world famous&quot;. Funded by Francis&#x27; father at the cost of $1000, the Pixies spent three days recording a 17-track demo at Fort Apache, known as the &quot;Purple Tape&quot; for its purple cover. The promoter Ken Goes became the Pixies&#x27; manager, and he passed the demo to Ivo Watts-Russell of the independent record label 4AD. Watts-Russell found the Pixies too normal and &quot;too rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, but signed them at the persuasion of his girlfriend.

Upon signing with 4AD, eight tracks from the Purple Tape were selected for the &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; mini-LP, the Pixies&#x27; first release. Francis drew upon his experiences in Puerto Rico, mostly in the songs &quot;Vamos&quot; and &quot;Isla de Encanta&quot;, describing the poverty in Puerto Rico and singing in loose Spanish. The religious lyrics and later albums came from his parents&#x27; born-again Christian days in the Pentecostal Church. The critic Heather Phares identified themes such as sexual frustration (&quot;I&#x27;ve Been Tired&quot;) and incest (&quot;Nimrod&#x27;s Son&quot; and &quot;The Holiday Song&quot;).

=== &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; and &quot;Doolittle&quot; (1988–1989) ===
&quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; was followed by the Pixies&#x27; first full-length album, &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;. It was recorded by Steve Albini, completed in two weeks, and released in early 1988. &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; gained the Pixies acclaim in Europe; both &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot; named it their &quot;Album of the Year&quot;. American critical response was positive but more muted, a reaction that persisted for much of the Pixies&#x27; career. &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; was eventually certified gold in the US in 2005. The Pixies arrived in England to support Throwing Muses on the European &quot;Sex and Death&quot; tour, beginning at the Mean Fiddler in London. The tour also took them to the Netherlands, where the Pixies had already received enough media attention to be headlining the tour.

The Pixies signed an American distribution deal with the major record label Elektra. Around this time, they struck up a relationship with the British producer Gil Norton. Norton produced their second full album, &quot;Doolittle&quot;, which was recorded in the last six weeks of 1988 and seen as a departure from the raw sound of &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;. &quot;Doolittle&quot; had a much cleaner sound, largely due to Norton and the production budget of US$40,000, which was quadruple that of &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;. &quot;Doolittle&quot; featured the single &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot;, which biographers Josh Frank and Caryn Ganz describe as an unusually jaunty and pop-like song for the band. &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot; was popular on alternative rock radio in the US, reaching the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks, and the single entered the Top 100 in the U.K. Like &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;, &quot;Doolittle&quot; was acclaimed by fans and music critics alike. &quot;Doolittle&quot; was their first album to enter into the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at 98. In the UK, the album was a commercial success, reaching number 8 in the Albums Chart.

=== Break (1989–1990) ===
After &quot;Doolittle&quot;, tensions between Deal and Francis came to a head (for example, Francis threw a guitar at Deal during a concert in Stuttgart), and Deal was almost fired from the band when she refused to play at a concert in Frankfurt. Santiago, in an interview with &quot;Mojo&quot;, described Deal as being &quot;headstrong and want[ing] to include her own songs, to explore her own world&quot; on the band&#x27;s albums; eventually she accepted that Francis was the singer and had musical control of the band, but after the Frankfurt incident, &quot;they kinda stopped talking&quot;. The band became increasingly tired during the post-&quot;Doolittle&quot; &quot;Fuck or Fight&quot; tour of the United States and fighting among members continued. After the tour&#x27;s final date in New York City, the band was too exhausted to attend the end-of-tour party the following night and soon announced a hiatus.

During this time, Santiago and Lovering went on vacation while Francis performed a short solo tour, made up of a number of concerts to generate gas money as he traveled across the country. Deal formed a new band, the Breeders, with Tanya Donelly of Throwing Muses and bass player Josephine Wiggs of Perfect Disaster. Their debut album, &quot;Pod&quot;, was released in 1990.

=== &quot;Bossanova&quot; and &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; (1990–1992) ===
In 1990, all members of the group except Deal moved to Los Angeles. Lovering stated that he, Santiago, and Francis moved there &quot;because the recording studio was there&quot;. Unlike previous recordings, the band had little time to practice beforehand, and Black Francis wrote much of the album in the studio. Featuring the singles &quot;Velouria&quot; and &quot;Dig for Fire&quot;, &quot;Bossanova&quot; reached number 70 in the United States. In contrast, the album peaked at number three in the United Kingdom. Also in 1990, the Pixies released a cover of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band&#x27;s &quot;Born in Chicago&quot; on the compilation album &quot;Rubáiyát: Elektra&#x27;s 40th Anniversary&quot;.

The band continued to tour and released &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; in 1991, their final album before their break-up. The album included &quot;U-Mass&quot;, which has been described as being about college apathy, and whose guitar riff was written years before at the University of Massachusetts before Francis and Santiago dropped out. The album also featured a cover of &quot;Head On&quot; by the Jesus and Mary Chain. Also that year, the band contributed a cover of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Forget&quot; to the Leonard Cohen tribute album &quot;I&#x27;m Your Fan&quot;, and began an international tour on which they played stadiums in Europe and smaller venues in the United States. They supported U2 on the lucrative US leg of their Zoo TV Tour in 1992. Tensions rose among band members, and at the end of the year, the Pixies went on sabbatical and focused on separate projects.

=== Breakup and solo projects (1993–2003) ===
In early 1993, Francis announced in an interview with BBC Radio 5 that the Pixies were finished, without telling the other members of the band. He offered no explanation at the time. He later called Santiago and notified Deal and Lovering via fax.

After the breakup, the members embarked on separate projects. Black Francis renamed himself Frank Black, and released several solo albums, including a string of releases with Frank Black and the Catholics. Deal returned to the Breeders, who achieved a hit single, &quot;Cannonball&quot;, from their platinum-selling &quot;Last Splash&quot; in 1993, and released more albums several years later. She also formed the Amps, who released one album.

Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black albums and other artists&#x27; albums. He wrote music for the television show &quot;Undeclared&quot; and theme music for the film &quot;Crime and Punishment in Suburbia&quot;. He formed the Martinis with his wife, Linda Mallari, and released the album &quot;Smitten&quot; in 2004. In 2004, he also played lead guitar on the album &quot;Statecraft&quot; by the novelist and musician Charles Douglas. Lovering became a magician and performed a style of magic he called &quot;scientific phenomenalism&quot;. He was temporarily a member of the Martinis, and later drummed with the band Cracker.

4AD and Elektra Records continued to release Pixies material: the best-of album &quot;Death to the Pixies&quot; (1997), the Peel-session compilation &quot;Pixies at the BBC&quot; (1998), and the &quot;Complete &#x27;B&#x27; Sides&quot; compilation (2001). In 2002, material from the Pixies&#x27; original 17-track demo tape was released as an EP, &quot;Pixies&quot;, on Cooking Vinyl in the U.K. and SpinART Records in the U.S.; Black has also used these labels to release solo work and albums with the Catholics. Their song &quot;Where is My Mind&quot; was played during the ending scene of the movie &quot;Fight Club&quot; in 1999, providing the song to a new generation of fans.

=== Reunion (2003–2012) ===
In the years following the Pixies&#x27; breakup, Black dismissed rumors of a reunion, but incorporated an increasing number of Pixies songs in his sets with the Catholics, and occasionally included Santiago in his solo work and Lovering&#x27;s magic show as an opening act to concerts. In 2003, a series of phone calls among band members resulted in some low-key rehearsals, and soon the decision to reunite. By February 2004, a full tour was announced, and tickets for nearly all the initial tour dates sold out within minutes.

The Pixies played their first reunion concert on April 13, 2004, at the Fine Line Music Cafe in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A warm-up tour through the U.S. and Canada (in which all dates were recorded and released as individual limited-edition CDs) was followed by an appearance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The band then spent much of 2004 touring in locations including Europe and the UK. The group won the Act-of-the-Year award in the 2004 &quot;Boston Music Awards&quot;. The 2004 reunion tour grossed over $14 million in ticket sales.

In June 2004, the band released a new song, &quot;Bam Thwok&quot; exclusively on the iTunes Music Store; it reached number one in the UK Official Download Chart. 4AD released &quot;Wave of Mutilation: The Best of Pixies&quot;, along with a companion DVD, &quot;Pixies&quot;. The band also contributed a rendition of &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Pretty at All&quot; to the Warren Zevon tribute album &quot;Enjoy Every Sandwich&quot;.
In 2005, the Pixies made appearances at festivals including Lollapalooza, &quot;T on the Fringe&quot;, and the Newport Folk Festival. They continued to make appearances through 2006 and 2007, culminating in their first shows in Australia. Francis suggested that a new Pixies studio album was possible, or unlikely, the main obstacle being Deal&#x27;s reluctance.

To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Doolittle&quot;, the Pixies launched a tour in October 2009 where they performed the album track-for-track, including the associated B-sides. The tour began in Europe, continued in the United States in November, with the South American and Australian tour following in March 2010, then New Zealand, and more European dates in spring 2010, and back to North America in 2010.

===Deal&#x27;s departure, &quot;Indie Cindy&quot; and the arrival of Lenchantin (2013–2015)===
On June 14, 2013, the Pixies announced that Deal had left the band. Two weeks later, the band released a new song, &quot;Bagboy&quot;, as a free download via the Pixies&#x27; website. The song features Jeremy Dubs of Bunnies and formerly of the Bennies on vocals in place of Deal. , Deal and her former bandmates have no relationship.

On July 1, 2013, the Pixies announced the addition of the Muffs and Pandoras guitarist and vocalist Kim Shattuck to replace Deal for their 2013 European tour. On September 3, 2013, the Pixies released an EP of new songs, &quot;EP1&quot;. On November 29, 2013, Shattuck announced that she had been dismissed from the band. In December 2013, it was announced that the Entrance Band and A Perfect Circle bassist Paz Lenchantin was joining the Pixies for the 2014 tour. Lenchantin said she had been a &quot;die-hard&quot; Pixies fan as a teenager and that Black was the greatest artist she had worked with. The Pixies released &quot;EP2&quot; on January 3, 2014. The single released to radio was &quot;Blue Eyed Hexe&quot;. Another new EP, &quot;EP3&quot;, was released on March 24, 2014. All the EPs were only available as downloads and limited-edition vinyl.

The three EPs were collected in LP format and released as the album, &quot;Indie Cindy,&quot; in April 2014. It was the first Pixies album in over two decades. In 2015, the Pixies toured in support of Robert Plant for a series of dates across North America.

===&quot;Head Carrier&quot;, &quot;Beneath the Eyrie&quot; and &quot;Doggerel&quot; (2016–2023)===
In July 2016, the Pixies announced that Lenchantin had become a permanent member, and that their sixth album, &quot;Head Carrier&quot;, would be released on September 30, 2016. Their seventh album, &quot;Beneath the Eyrie&quot;, was released on September 13, 2019, with the lead single, &quot;On Graveyard Hill&quot;. The Pixies released a podcast, &quot;It&#x27;s a Pixies Podcast&quot;, documenting the recording of the album. The Pixies released a non-album single, &quot;Human Crime&quot;, in March 2022. They released their eighth studio album, &quot;Doggerel&quot;, with the single &quot;There&#x27;s a Moon On&quot; on September 30 via BMG.

===Lenchantin&#x27;s departure, arrival of Richardson and &quot;The Night the Zombies Came&quot; (2024–present)===

On 4 March 2024, the Pixies announced that Lenchantin had left &quot;to concentrate on her own projects&quot;. In a statement to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Lenchantin said that the choice was not hers and that her &quot;departure [was] a bit of a surprise to [her] as it is to many&quot;. She was replaced on the following tour by Emma Richardson, formerly of Band of Skulls. The tour celebrated the Pixies&#x27; third and fourth albums, &quot;Bossanova&quot; (1990) and &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; (1991), with Francis describing it as &quot;delightful&quot;. In June, the Pixies released the single &quot;You&#x27;re So Impatient&quot;, Richardson&#x27;s first studio credit with the band.

On October 25, 2024, the Pixies released their ninth full-length studio album, &quot;The Night the Zombies Came&quot;, produced by Tom Dalgety, who also worked on their previous three studio albums. Regarding the title, Francis said: &quot;It&#x27;s not like I wrote a bunch of songs about zombies or that we tried to make the album sound scary or anything like that. &#x27;Zombie&#x27; is just an associative word. You can do with it what you like. And it&#x27;s not a concept record, but that word kept popping up in the lyrics. When I combed through all the other lyrics for a title, they just sounded corny as shit. The only thing that made sense was &quot;The Night the Zombies Came&quot;. And I was like, &#x27;You know what? That&#x27;s a pretty good title. I&#x27;d go see that movie.&#x27;&quot; The album was preceded by the singles &quot;You&#x27;re So Impatient&quot;, &quot;Chicken&quot;, &quot;Oyster Beds&quot; and &quot;Motoroller&quot;.

== Style ==

=== Music ===
The Pixies incorporate elements of surf rock and punk rock, with an emphasis on contrasting volume dynamics. &quot;Spin&quot; described them as &quot;surf music-meets-Stooges spikiness and oft-imitated stop/start and quiet/loud dynamics&quot;. Their music was described as &quot;an unorthodox marriage of surf music and punk rock ... characterized by Black&#x27;s bristling lyrics and hackle-raising caterwaul, Deal&#x27;s whispered harmonies and waspy basslines, Joey Santiago&#x27;s fragile guitar, and the persistent flush of David Lovering&#x27;s drums.&quot;

The music incorporates extreme dynamic shifts. Francis said in 1991, &quot;Those are the two basic components of rock music ... the dreamy side and the rockin&#x27; side. It&#x27;s always been either sweaty or laid back and cool. We do try to be dynamic, but it&#x27;s dumbo dynamics, because we don&#x27;t know how to do anything else. We can play loud or quiet—that&#x27;s it.&quot;

=== Influences ===
The Pixies are influenced by a range of artists and genres; each member came from a different musical background. When he first started writing songs for the Pixies, Francis says he was listening to nothing but Hüsker Dü, Captain Beefheart, and Iggy Pop; whilst in the run up to recording &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; he listened to R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Murmur&quot; a lot, which he described as &quot;hugely influential&quot; on his songwriting. During the making of &quot;Doolittle&quot; he listened heavily to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot;. He has cited Buddy Holly as a model for his compressed songwriting. Francis did not discover punk rock until he was 16, saying &quot;it was good I didn&#x27;t listen to these hip records&quot;. As a child, he listened mainly to 1960s songs, religious music and Emerson Lake and Palmer, [...] and Talking Heads, who he says &quot;weren&#x27;t punk either&quot;.

Santiago listened to 1970s and 1980s punk including Black Flag, as well as David Bowie and T. Rex. Guitarists who influenced him include Jimi Hendrix, Les Paul, Wes Montgomery, Lou Reed and George Harrison. Deal&#x27;s musical background was folk music and country; she had formed a country-folk band with her sister in her teenage years, and played covers of artists such as the Everly Brothers and Hank Williams. Other artists Deal listened to included XTC, Gang of Four and Elvis Costello. Lovering is a fan of the band Rush.

Film has influenced the Pixies; Francis cites surrealist films &quot;Eraserhead&quot; and &quot;Un chien andalou&quot; (as mentioned in &quot;Debaser&quot;) as influences. He has said he &quot;didn&#x27;t have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels&quot;, but found it easier to watch twenty-minute films.

=== Songwriting, lyrical themes and vocals ===
Most of the Pixies&#x27; songs are composed and sung by Francis. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine has described Francis&#x27;s writing as containing &quot;bizarre, fragmented lyrics about space, religion, sex, mutilation, and pop culture&quot;. Biblical violence is a theme of &quot;Doolittle&quot;″s &quot;Dead&quot; and &quot;Gouge Away&quot;; Francis told a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; interviewer, &quot;It&#x27;s all those characters in the Old Testament. I&#x27;m obsessed with them. Why it comes out so much I don&#x27;t know.&quot; He has described &quot;Come On Pilgrim″s&quot; &quot;Caribou&quot; as being about reincarnation, and extraterrestrial themes appear in a number of songs on &quot;Bossanova&quot;.

Deal co-wrote &quot;Doolittle&quot;″s &quot;Silver&quot; with Francis, and they share lead harmony vocals on the track. She also co-wrote and sang lead vocals on &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;″s &quot;Gigantic&quot;, and wrote the 2004 single &quot;Bam Thwok&quot;. She was credited as Mrs. John Murphy on &quot;Gigantic&quot;—at the time she was married, and she used this name as an ironic feminist joke. She also sang lead vocals on the song &quot;Into the White&quot; and the Neil Young cover &quot;Winterlong&quot;, both B-sides.

Lovering sang lead vocals on &quot;Doolittle&quot;″s &quot;La La Love You&quot; and the B-side &quot;Make Believe&quot;. Lenchantin made her lead vocal debut on &quot;Head Carrier&quot;″s &quot;All I Think About Now&quot;. She also provided lead vocals on &quot;Los Surfers Muertos&quot;, from 2019&#x27;s &quot;Beneath The Eyrie&quot; and the 2020 September single &quot;Hear Me Out&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The Pixies&#x27; first album, &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;, is certified gold, while &quot;Doolittle&quot; is certified platinum, selling over 1 million copies. The band influenced a number of musicians associated with the alternative rock boom of the 1990s. Gary Smith, who produced &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;, said in 1997:

I&#x27;ve heard it said about the Velvet Underground that while not a lot of people bought their albums, everyone who did started a band. I think this is largely true about the Pixies as well. Charles&#x27; secret weapon turned out to be not so secret and, sooner or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all the world like a Pixies song.

The Pixies are credited with popularizing the extreme dynamics and stop-start timing that would become widespread in alternative rock. Their songs typically feature hushed, restrained verses, and explosive, wailing choruses.

Artists including David Bowie, Matt Noveskey, Radiohead, PJ Harvey, U2, Nirvana, the Strokes, Alice in Chains, Arcade Fire, Pavement, Everclear, Kings of Leon and Matthew Good have cited admiration of the Pixies. Bono of U2, one of the Pixies&#x27; influences, said the Pixies had made &quot;just about the most compelling music of the entire 80s&quot; and were one of the greatest American bands. Radiohead&#x27;s Thom Yorke said that the Pixies &quot;changed [his] life&quot;.

One notable citation as an influence was by Kurt Cobain, on influencing Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, which he admitted was a conscious attempt to co-opt the Pixies&#x27; style. In a January 1994 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he said, &quot;I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it [smiles]. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band—or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard.&quot; Cobain cited &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; as one of his main musical influences, and particularly admired the album&#x27;s natural and powerful drum sounds—a result of Steve Albini&#x27;s influence on the record. Albini later produced Nirvana&#x27;s 1993 &quot;In Utero&quot; at the request of Cobain.

Other bands and artists who have cited the Pixies as an influence include Weezer, Gavin Rossdale of Bush, Snow Patrol, Slowdive, OK Go, Eve 6, Thrice, Better Than Ezra, Toadies, Ash, Ride, Veruca Salt, Sleeper, Lemuria, and Treepeople.

== Music videos and DVDs ==
No music videos were released from &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; or &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;, but from &quot;Doolittle&quot; onwards, the following videos were made: &quot;Monkey Gone To Heaven&quot;, &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot;, &quot;Velouria&quot;, &quot;Dig For Fire&quot;, &quot;Allison&quot;, &quot;Alec Eiffel&quot;, &quot;Head On&quot;, and &quot;Debaser&quot;; these were later released on the 2004 DVD &quot;Pixies&quot;. The videos for &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; and &quot;Allison&quot; were also released on &quot;The Complete &#x27;B&#x27; Sides&quot;. Furthermore, a music video accompanied the release of their 2013 song, &quot;Bagboy&quot;, as well an alternate video released on a later date. Videos were made for all the songs on both &quot;EP1&quot; and &quot;EP2&quot; and for &quot;Silver Snail&quot; and &quot;Ring the Bell&quot; from &quot;EP3&quot;. From &quot;Head Carrier&quot; onwards, the following videos were made: &quot;Tenement Song&quot;, &quot;Um Chagga Lagga&quot;, &quot;On Graveyard Hill&quot;, &quot;Catfish Kate&quot;, &quot;Long Rider&quot;, &quot;Hear Me Out&quot;, &quot;Human Crime&quot; and &quot;Vault of Heaven&quot;.

By &quot;Bossanova&quot;, the band had developed a severe aversion to recording music videos, and Francis refused to lip-sync to them. For example, in the &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; video, both Black and Deal open their mouths wide instead of mouthing their lyrics. According to the record label, this became one of the reasons that Pixies never achieved major coverage on MTV. With &quot;Bossanova&quot;″s release, 4AD hoped to get the Pixies chosen to perform their single &quot;Velouria&quot; on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. To this end, the band was pressured into producing a video for the song, and made one cheaply with the band members filmed running down a quarry, shown in slow motion. The group was ultimately not given a spot on the show.

The 90-minute documentary &quot;loudQUIETloud: a film about the Pixies&quot; was directed by Steven Cantor and Matthew Galkin and released in 2006. The film documents their 2004 reunion and tour, and covers the years after the break-up. In addition to &quot;Pixies&quot; and &quot;LoudQUIETloud&quot;, four other Pixies DVDs were released between 2004 and 2006, all featuring concert performances: &quot;Live at the Town and Country Club 1988&quot;, &quot;The Pixies—Sell Out&quot;, &quot;The Pixies Acoustic: Live in Newport&quot;, and &quot;The Pixies Club Date: Live at the Paradise in Boston&quot;.

<text>In semiconductor manufacturing plasma ashing is the process of removing the photoresist (light sensitive coating) from an etched wafer. Using a plasma source, a monatomic (single atom) substance known as a reactive species is generated. Oxygen or fluorine are the most common reactive species. Other gases used are N2/H2 where the H2 portion is 2%. The reactive species combines with the photoresist to form ash which is removed with a vacuum pump.

Typically, monatomic oxygen plasma is created by exposing oxygen gas (O2) at a low pressure to high power radio waves, which ionise it. This process is done under vacuum in order to create a plasma. As the plasma is formed, many free radicals and also oxygen ions are created. These ions could damage the wafer due to the electric field build up between the plasma and the wafer surface. Newer, smaller circuitry is increasingly susceptible to these charged particles that can get implanted into the surface. Originally, plasma was generated in the process chamber, but as the need to get rid of the ions has increased, many machines now use a downstream plasma configuration, where plasma is formed remotely and the desired particles are channeled to the wafer. This allows electrically charged particles time to recombine before they reach the wafer surface, and prevents damage to the wafer surface.

== Types ==
Two forms of plasma ashing are typically performed on wafers. High temperature ashing, or stripping, is performed to remove as much photo resist as possible, while the &quot;descum&quot; process is used to remove residual photo resist in trenches. The main difference between the two processes is the temperature the wafer is exposed to while in an ashing chamber. Typical issues arise when this photoresist has undergone an implant step previously and heavy metal are embedded in the photoresist and it has experienced high temperatures causing it to be resistant to oxidizing. 

Monatomic oxygen is electrically neutral and although it does recombine during the channeling, it does so at a slower rate than the positively or negatively charged free radicals, which attract one another. This means that when all of the free radicals have recombined, there is still a portion of the active species available for process. Because a large portion of the active species is lost to recombination, process times may take longer. To some extent, these longer process times can be mitigated by increasing the temperature of the reaction area. This also contribute to the observation of the spectral optical traces, these can be what is normally expected when the emission declines, the process is over; it can also mean that spectral lines increase in illuminance as the available reactants are consumed causing a rise in certain spectral lines representing the available ionic species.

<text>Psychophysiology (from Greek , &quot;psȳkhē&quot;, &quot;breath, life, soul&quot;; , &quot;physis&quot;, &quot;nature, origin&quot;; and , &quot;&quot;) is the branch of psychology that is concerned with the physiological bases of psychological processes. While psychophysiology was a general broad field of research in the 1960s and 1970s, it has now become quite specialized, based on methods, topic of studies and scientific traditions. Methods vary as combinations of electrophysiological methods (such as EEG), neuroimaging (MRI, PET), and neurochemistry. Topics have branched into subspecializations such as social, sport, cognitive, cardiovascular, clinical and other branches of psychophysiology.

== Background ==

Some people have difficulty distinguishing a psychophysiologist from a physiological psychologist, which have two very different perspectives. Psychologists are interested in why we may fear spiders and physiologists may be interested in the input/output system of the amygdala. A psychophysiologist will attempt to link the two. Psychophysiologists generally study the psychological/physiological link in intact human subjects. While early psychophysiologists almost always examined the impact of psychological states on physiological system responses, since the 1970s, psychophysiologists also frequently study the impact of physiological states and systems on psychological states and processes. It is this perspective of studying the interface of mind and body that makes psychophysiologists most distinct.

Historically, most psychophysiologists tended to examine the physiological responses and organ systems innervated by the autonomic nervous system. More recently, psychophysiologists have been equally, or potentially more, interested in the central nervous system, exploring cortical brain potentials such as the many types of event-related potentials (ERPs), brain waves, and utilizing advanced technology such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), MRI, PET, MEG, and other neuroimagery techniques.

A psychophysiologist may look at how exposure to a stressful situation will produce a result in the cardiovascular system such as a change in heart rate (HR), vasodilation/vasoconstriction, myocardial contractility, or stroke volume. Overlaps in areas of interest between psychophysiologists and physiological psychologist may consist of observing how one cardiovascular event may influence another cardiovascular or endocrine event; or how activation of one neural brain structure exerts excitatory activity in another neural structure which then induces an inhibitory effect in some other system. Often, physiological psychologists examine the effects that they study in infrahuman subjects using surgical or invasive techniques and processes.

Psychophysiology is closely related to the field of neuroscience, which primarily concerns itself with relationships between psychological events and brain processes. Psychophysiology is also related to the medical disciplines, such as endocrinology, psychosomatics and psychopharmacology.

While psychophysiology was a discipline off the mainstream of psychological and medical science prior to roughly the 1940s, more recently, psychophysiology has found itself positioned at the intersection of psychological and medical science, and its popularity and importance have expanded commensurately with the realization of the inter-relatedness of mind and body.

==Measures==
Psychophysiology measures exist in multiple domains; reports, electrophysiological studies, studies in neurochemistry, neuroimaging and behavioral methods. Evaluative reports involve participant introspection and self-ratings of internal psychological states or physiological sensations, such as self-report of arousal levels on the self-assessment manikin, or measures of interoceptive visceral awareness such as heartbeat detection. Merits to self-report are an emphasis on accurately understand the participants&#x27; subjective experience and understanding their perception; however, its pitfalls include the possibility of participants misunderstanding a scale or incorrectly recalling events.

Physiological responses also can be measured via instruments that read bodily events such as heart rate change, electrodermal activity (EDA), muscle tension, and cardiac output. Many indices are part of modern psychophysiology, including brain waves (electroencephalography, EEG), fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), electrodermal activity (a standardized term encompassing skin conductance response, SCR, and galvanic skin response, GSR), cardiovascular measures (heart rate, HR; beats per minute, BPM; heart rate variability, HRV; vasomotor activity), muscle activity (electromyography, EMG), electrogastrogram (EGG) changes in pupil diameter with thought and emotion (pupillometry), eye movements, recorded via the electro-oculogram (EOG) and direction-of-gaze methods, cardiodynamics, recorded via impedance cardiography, and grip force.

These measures are beneficial because they provide accurate and perceiver-independent objective data recorded by machinery. The downsides, however, are that any physical activity or motion can alter responses, and basal levels of arousal and responsiveness can differ among individuals and even between situations.
Neurochemical methods are used to study functionality and processes associated to neurotransmitters and neuropeptides

Finally, one can measure overt action or behavior, which involves the observation and recording actual actions, such as running, freezing, eye movement, and facial expression. These are good response measures and easy to record in animals, but they are not as frequently used in human studies.

== Uses ==
Psychophysiological measures are often used to study emotion and attention responses to stimuli, during exertion, and increasingly, to better understand cognitive processes.
Physiological sensors have been used to detect emotions in schools and intelligent tutoring systems.

==Emotions as example of psychophysiological studies==

Psychophysiology studies multiple aspects of behavior, and emotions are the most common example. 
It has long been recognized that emotional episodes are partly constituted by physiological responses. Early work done linking emotions to psychophysiology started with research on mapping consistent autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to discrete emotional states. For example, anger might be constituted by a certain set of physiological responses, such as increased cardiac output and high diastolic blood pressure, which would allow us to better understand patterns and predict emotional responses.

Some studies were able to detect consistent patterns of ANS responses that corresponded to specific emotions under certain contexts, like an early study by Paul Ekman and colleagues in 1983 &quot;Emotion-specific activity in the autonomic nervous system was generated by constructing facial prototypes of emotion muscle by muscle and by reliving past emotional experiences. The autonomic activity produced distinguished not only between positive and negative emotions, but also among negative emotions&quot;. 
However, as more studies were conducted, more variability was found in ANS responses to discrete emotion inductions, not only among individuals but also over time in the same individuals, and greatly between social groups.

Some of these differences can be attributed to variables like induction technique, context of the study, or classification of stimuli, which can alter a perceived scenario or emotional response. However it was also found that features of the participant could also alter ANS responses. Factors such as basal level of arousal at the time of experimentation or between test recovery, learned or conditioned responses to certain stimuli, range and maximal level of effect of ANS action, and individual attentiveness can all alter physiological responses in a lab setting. Even supposedly discrete emotional states fail to show specificity. For example, some emotional typologists consider fear to have subtypes, which might involve fleeing or freezing, both of which can have distinct physiological patterns and potentially distinct neural circuitry. As such no definitive correlation can be drawn linking specific autonomic patterns to discrete emotions, causing emotion theorists to rethink classical definitions of emotions.

== Psychophysiological inference and physiological computer games ==

Physiological computing represents a category of affective computing that incorporates real-time software adaption to the psychophysiological activity of the user. The main goal of this is to build a computer that responds to user emotion, cognition and motivation. The approach is to enable implicit and symmetrical human-computer communication by granting the software access to a representation of the user&#x27;s psychological status.

There are several possible methods to represent the psychological state of the user (discussed in the affective computing page). The advantages of using psychophysiological indices are that their changes are continuous, measures are covert and implicit, and only available data source when the user interacts with the computer without any explicit communication or input device. These systems rely upon an assumption that the psychophysiological measure is an accurate one-to-one representation of a relevant psychological dimension such as mental effort, task engagement and frustration.

Physiological computing systems all contain an element that may be termed as an adaptive controller that may be used to represent the player. This adaptive controller represents the decision-making process underlying software adaptation. In their simplest form, adaptive controllers are expressed in Boolean statements. Adaptive controllers encompass not only the decision-making rules, but also the psychophysiological inference that is implicit in the quantification of those trigger points used to activate the rules. The representation of the player using an adaptive controller can become very complex and often only one-dimensional. The loop used to describe this process is known as the biocybernetic loop. The biocybernetic loop describes the closed loop system that receives psychophysiological data from the player, transforms that data into a computerized response, which then shapes the future psychophysiological response from the player. A positive control loop tends towards instability as player-software loop strives towards a higher standard of desirable performance. The physiological computer game may wish to incorporate both positive and negative loops into the adaptive controller.

<doc id="23733" wikidata="Q816829" url="?curid=23733" title="Periodization">
<text>In historiography, periodization is the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete, quantified, and named blocks of time for the purpose of study or analysis. This is usually done to understand current and historical processes, and the causality that might have linked those events.

Periodizations can provide a convenient segmentation of time, wherein events within the period might consist of relatively similar characteristics. However, determining the precise beginning and ending of any &#x27;period&#x27; is often arbitrary, since it has changed over time and over the course of history. Systems of periodization are more or less arbitrary, yet it provides a framework to help us understand them. Periodizing labels are continually challenged and redefined, but once established, period &quot;brands&quot; are so convenient that many are hard to change.

==History==
The practice of dividing history into ages or periods is as early as the development of writing, and can be traced to the Sumerian 
 period. The &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, dating to the second millennium BC—and for most parts it is not considered historically accurate—is &quot;periodized&quot; into dynastic regnal eras. The classical division into a Golden Age, Silver Age, Bronze Age, Heroic Age, and Iron Age goes back to Hesiod in the 8th – 7th century BC.

One Biblical periodization scheme commonly used in the Middle Ages was Saint Paul&#x27;s theological division of history into three ages: the first before the age of Moses (under nature); the second under Mosaic law (under law); the third in the age of Christ (under grace). But perhaps the most widely discussed periodization scheme of the Middle Ages was the Six Ages of the World, written by the early 5th century AD, where every age was a thousand years counting from Adam to the present, with the present time (in the Middle Ages) being the sixth and final age.

==Background==
Periodizing blocks might overlap, conflict or contradict one another. Some have a cultural usage (the &quot;Gilded Age&quot;), others refer to prominent historical events (&#x27;the Interwar period), while others are defined by decimal numbering systems (&#x27;the 1960s&#x27;, &#x27;the 17th century&#x27;). Other periods are named from influential individuals (the &#x27;Napoleonic Era&#x27;, the &#x27;Victorian Era&#x27;, and the &#x27;Porfiriato&#x27;).

Some of these usages will also be geographically specific. This is especially true of periodizing labels derived from individuals or ruling dynasties, such as the Jacksonian Era in America, the Meiji Era in Japan, or the Merovingian Period in France. Cultural terms may also have a limited reach. Thus the concept of the &quot;Romantic period&quot; is largely meaningless outside the Western world of Europe and European-influenced cultures. Likewise, &#x27;the 1960s&#x27;, though technically applicable to anywhere in the world according to Common Era numbering, has a certain set of specific cultural connotations in certain countries. For this reason, it may be possible to say such things as &quot;The 1960s never occurred in Spain&quot;. This would mean that the sexual revolution, counterculture, youth rebellion and so on never developed during that decade in Spain&#x27;s conservative Roman Catholic culture and under Francisco Franco&#x27;s authoritarian regime. The historian Arthur Marwick mentions that &quot;the 1960s&#x27; began in the late 1950s and ended in the early 1970s&quot;. This was because the cultural and economic conditions that define the meaning of the period covers more than the accidental fact of a 10-year block beginning with the number 6. This extended usage is termed the &#x27;long 1960s&#x27;. This usage derives from other historians who have adopted labels such as &quot;the long 19th century&quot; (1789–1914) to reconcile arbitrary decimal chronology with meaningful cultural and social phases. Eric Hobsbawm has also argued for what he calls &quot;the short twentieth century&quot;, encompassing the period from the First World War through to the end of the Cold War.

Periodizing terms often have negative or positive connotations that may affect their usage. This includes &quot;Victorian&quot;, which often negatively suggests sexual repression and class conflict. Other labels such as &quot;Renaissance&quot; have strongly positive characteristics. As a result, these terms sometimes extend in meaning. Thus the &quot;English Renaissance&quot; is often used for a period largely identical to the &quot;Elizabethan Period&quot; or reign of Elizabeth I, and begins some 200 years later than the Italian Renaissance. However the &quot;Carolingian Renaissance&quot; is said to have occurred during the reign of the Frankish king Charlemagne, and his immediate successors, and the Macedonian Renaissance occurred in the Eastern Roman Empire. Other examples, neither of which constituted a &quot;rebirth&quot; in the sense of revival, are the &quot;American Renaissance&quot; of the 1820s–1860s, referring mainly to literature, and the &quot;Harlem Renaissance&quot; of the 1920s, referring mainly to literature but also to music and the visual arts.

The conception of a &#x27;rebirth&#x27; of Classical Latin learning is first credited to the Italian poet Petrarch (1304–1374), the father of Renaissance Humanism, but the conception of a rebirth has been in common use since Petrarch&#x27;s time. The dominant usage of the word &quot;Renaissance&quot; refers to the cultural changes that occurred in Italy that culminated in the High Renaissance around 1500–1530. This concept applies dominantly to the visual arts, and the work of Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci. Secondarily it is applied to other arts, but it is questionable whether it is useful to describe a phase in economic, social and political history. Many professional historians now refer to the historical periods commonly known as the Renaissance and the Reformation as the start of the Early Modern Period, which extends much later. There is a gradual change in the courses taught and books published to correspond to the change in period nomenclature, which in part reflects differences between social history and cultural history. The new nomenclature suggests a broader geographical coverage and a growing attention to the relationships between Europe and the wider world.

The term Middle Ages also derives from Petrarch. He was comparing his own period to the Ancient or Classical world, seeing his time as a time of rebirth after a dark intermediate period, the Middle Ages. The idea that the Middle Ages was a middle phase between two other large scale periodizing concepts, Ancient and Modern, still persists. It can be subdivided into the Early, High and Late Middle Ages. The term Dark Ages is no longer in common use among modern scholars because of the difficulty of using it neutrally, though some writers have attempted to retain it and divest it of its negative connotations. The term &quot;Middle Ages&quot; and especially the adjective &quot;medieval&quot; can also have a negative ring in colloquial use, but does not carry over into academic terminology. However, other terms, such as Gothic architecture, used to refer to a style typical of the High Middle Ages have largely lost the negative connotations they initially had, acquiring new meanings over time (see Gothic architecture and Goth subculture).

The Gothic and the Baroque were both named during subsequent stylistic periods when the preceding style was unpopular. The word &quot;Gothic&quot; was applied as a pejorative term to all things Northern European and, hence, barbarian, probably first by Giorgio Vasari. He coined the term &quot;Gothic&quot; in an effort to describe (particularly architecture) what he found objectionable. The word &quot;baroque&quot;—derived from similar words in Portuguese, Spanish, or French—literally refers to an irregular or misshapen pearl. Its first use outside the field of jewellery manufacture was in the early 18th century, as a criticism of music that was viewed as over-complicated and rough. Later, the term was also used to describe architecture and art. The Baroque period was first designated as such in the 19th century, and is generally considered to have begun around 1600 in all media. Music history places the end of the period in the year 1750 with the death of J. S. Bach, while art historians consider the main period to have ended significantly earlier in most areas.

==Three-age system==

In archeology, the usual method for periodization of the distant prehistoric past is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used. The system further underwent subdivisions, including the 1865 partitioning of the Stone Age into Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic periods by John Lubbock.

==Historiography==

Some events or short periods of change have such a drastic effect on the cultures they affect that they form a natural break in history. These are often marked by the widespread use of both &quot;pre-&quot; and &quot;post-&quot; phrases centered on the event, as in &quot;pre-Reformation&quot; and &quot;post-Reformation&quot;, or &quot;pre-colonial&quot; and &quot;post-colonial&quot;. Both and post-war are still understood to refer to World War II, though at some future point the phrases will need to be altered to make that clear.

== World history ==

Several major periods historians may use are:
# Prehistory
# Ancient history
# Late antiquity
# Post-classical history
# Early modern period
# Modern history (sometimes the nineteenth century and modern are combined)
# Contemporary history
Although &quot;post-classical&quot; is synonymous with the Middle Ages of Western Europe, the term &quot;post-classical&quot; is not necessarily a member of the traditional tripartite periodization of Western European history into &#x27;classical&#x27;, &#x27;middle&#x27; and &#x27;modern&#x27;.

Some popularized periodizations using the terms long or short by historians are:

* Long eighteenth century

* Long nineteenth century
* Short twentieth century
