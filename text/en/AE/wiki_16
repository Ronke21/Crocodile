<text>Marmite ( ) is a British savoury food spread based on yeast extract, invented by the German scientist Justus von Liebig. It is made from by-products of beer brewing (lees) and is produced by the British company Unilever. Marmite is a vegan source of B vitamins, including supplemental vitamin B12. A traditional method of use is to spread it very thinly on buttered toast.

Marmite is a sticky, dark brown paste with a distinctive, salty, powerful flavour and heady aroma. This distinctive taste is represented in the marketing slogan: &quot;Love it or hate it.&quot; Such is its prominence in British popular culture that Marmite is often used as a metaphor for something that is an acquired taste or polarises opinion. Marmite is commonly used as a flavouring, as it is particularly rich in umami due to its very high levels of glutamate (1960 mg/100 g).

The image on the jar shows a &quot;marmite&quot; (), a French term for a large, covered earthenware or metal cooking pot. Marmite was originally supplied in earthenware pots but since the 1920s has been sold in glass jars. Marmite&#x27;s distinctive bulbous jars are supplied to Unilever by the German glass manufacturer Gerresheimer.

Similar products include the Australian Vegemite (whose name is derived from that of Marmite), the Swiss Cenovis, the Brazilian Cenovit, the long-extinct Argentinian Condibé, the French , and the German Vitam-R. Marmite in New Zealand has been manufactured since 1919 under licence, but with a different recipe; it is the only one sold as &quot;Marmite&quot; in Australasia and the Pacific Islands, whereas elsewhere the British version predominates.

== History ==
The product that was to become Marmite was invented during the late 19th century when the German scientist Justus von Liebig discovered that brewer&#x27;s yeast could be concentrated, bottled and eaten. In 1902, the Marmite Food Extract Company was formed in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England with Marmite as its main product and Burton as the site of the first factory. The by-product yeast needed for the paste was supplied by Bass Brewery. By 1907, the product had become successful enough to warrant construction of a second factory at Camberwell Green in London.

By 1912, the discovery of vitamins was a boost for Marmite, as the spread is a rich source of the vitamin B complex;
with the vitamin B1 deficiency beriberi being common during World War I, the spread became more popular. British troops during World War I were issued Marmite as part of their rations.

During the 1930s, Marmite was used by the English scientist Lucy Wills to successfully treat a form of anaemia in mill workers in Bombay. She later identified folic acid as the active ingredient. Marmite was used to treat malnutrition by Suriya-Mal workers during the 1934–35 malaria epidemic in Sri Lanka. Housewives were encouraged to spread Marmite thinly and to &quot;use it sparingly just now&quot; because of limited rations of the product.

In 1990, Marmite Limited, which had become a subsidiary of Bovril Limited, was bought by CPC International Inc, which changed its name to Best Foods Inc in 1998. Best Foods Inc subsequently merged with Unilever in 2000, and Marmite is now a trademark owned by Unilever.

== Similar products ==
There are a number of similar yeast products available in other countries; these products are not directly connected to the original Marmite recipe and brand. The Australian product Vegemite was developed in early 1920s by Cyril Callister for Fred Walker and Co. due to shortages of Marmite exports to Australia as a result of the First World War. It is now distributed in many countries, and AussieMite is sold in Australia. Other products include OzeMite, which is made by Dick Smith Foods; Cenovit, a Brazilian spread; Vitam-R, a German spread; Cenovis, a Swiss spread (sold internationally under the brand Sonaris); and Vegex, an autolyzed yeast product available in the United States since 1913. In the United Kingdom, own-branded yeast extract, very similar to Marmite, is sold by Sainsbury&#x27;s, Tesco and Aldi.

== Usage ==
Marmite has traditionally been eaten as a savoury spread on bread, toast, savoury biscuits or crackers, and other similar baked products. Owing to its concentrated taste, it is often spread very thinly in combination with butter or margarine. It can be made into a savoury hot drink by adding one teaspoon to a mug of hot water, much like Oxo or Bovril. It is also commonly used to enrich casseroles and stews.

Marmite is often paired with cheese—for example, in a cheese sandwich or a cheese-flavoured biscuit such as Mini Cheddars. In the UK, Starbucks offers a cheese and Marmite panini. There are Marmite-flavoured varieties of Walkers Crisps, and of some brands of rice cakes and biscuits.

Marmite has also been used as an ingredient in cocktails, including the Marmite Cocktail and the Marmite Gold Rush.

Celebrity chefs have created signature Marmite-flavoured recipes: Nigella Lawson has one for Marmite spaghetti, and Heston Blumenthal has one for Marmite consommé.

In 2020, Marmite launched a campaign on Instagram—&quot;The Great Marmite Experiment&quot;—-encouraging people to share their Marmite-flavoured recipes. The many entries in response included roast potatoes, beef Wellington and cookies.

In Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, Marmite is enjoyed stirred into congee (rice porridge), and in an intensely savory Malaysian dish (local Chinese dish) called Marmite Chicken, consisting of fried pieces of chicken tossed in a Marmite sauce.

== Manufacture ==
While the process is secret, the general method for making yeast extract on a commercial scale is to add salt to a suspension of yeast, making the solution hypertonic, which results in the cells shrivelling; this triggers autolysis, during which the yeast self-destructs. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, and since yeast cells have thick cell walls which would detract from the smoothness of the end product, the husks are sieved out. As with other yeast extracts, Marmite contains free glutamic acid, the monosodium salt of which being monosodium glutamate.

Currently, the main ingredients of Marmite are glutamic acid-rich yeast extract, with lesser quantities of salt, vegetable extract, spice extracts and celery extracts, although the precise composition is a trade secret. Vitamins added for food fortification include riboflavin, folic acid, and Vitamin B. Vitamin B is not naturally found in yeast extract, but is very important for vegans who are at risk of deficiency.

== Nutritional information ==
Marmite is rich in B vitamins including thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), and folic acid (B9). Vitamin B12 is only available through artificial enrichment; riboflavin and folic acid are added on top of the naturally-occurring amount. The sodium content of the spread is high and has caused concern, although it is the amount per serving rather than the percentage in bulk Marmite that is relevant. The main ingredient of Marmite is yeast extract, which contains a high concentration of glutamic acid. Marmite is not gluten-free, as it is made with wheat, and although it is thoroughly washed, it may contain small quantities of gluten. (Sodium amount is noted as table salt-equivalent in UK nutritional labels. 6.1 g of salt corresponds to 2.4 g of sodium.)

Marmite is contraindicated if a person takes a monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant, such as phenelzine (Nardil) or tranylcypromine (Parnate), as yeast extracts interact adversely with these types of medications due to their tyramine content.

== Storage ==
Marmite should be stored in the dark and kept cool, but should not be refrigerated. The &quot;best before&quot; date is given as guidance for the loss of vitamins rather than safety.

== Marketing ==

Marmite&#x27;s publicity campaigns initially emphasised the spread&#x27;s healthy nature, extolling it as &quot;The growing up spread you never grow out of&quot;. The first major Marmite advertising campaign began during the 1930s, with characters whose faces incorporated the word &quot;good&quot;. Soon afterwards, the increasing awareness of vitamins was used in Marmite advertising, with slogans proclaiming that &quot;A small quantity added to the daily diet will ensure you and your family are taking sufficient vitamin B to keep nerves, brain, and digestion in proper working order&quot;.

During the 1980s, the spread was advertised with the slogan &quot;My mate, Marmite&quot;, chanted in television commercials by an army platoon. The spread had been a standard vitamin supplement for British-based German POWs during the Second World War. For many years television advertisements for Marmite featured the song &quot;Low Rider&quot; by the band War with the lyrics changed to the phrase &quot;My Mate, Marmite&quot;.

===Love/hate polarisation===
By the 1990s Marmite&#x27;s distinctive and powerful flavour had earned it as many detractors as it had fans, and it was known for producing a polarised &quot;love/hate&quot; reaction amongst consumers. Marmite began a &quot;Love it or Hate it&quot; campaign in October 1996, and this resulted in the inventing of the phrase &quot;Marmite effect&quot; or &quot;Marmite reaction&quot; for anything which provoked controversy. On 22 April 2010, Unilever threatened legal action against the British National Party for using a jar of Marmite and the &quot;love it or hate it&quot; slogan in a party political broadcast.

== Availability worldwide ==

Because of the local product named &quot;Marmite&quot;, European Marmite is sold by the name &quot;Our Mate&quot; in Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand Marmite uses the name &quot;NZ-Mite&quot; elsewhere.

=== Denmark ===
In Denmark, food safety legislation dictates that foodstuffs that contain added vitamins can only be sold by retailers which have been licensed by the Veterinary and Food Administration. In May 2011, the company that imports the product to Denmark revealed that it was not licensed and had therefore stopped selling the product: this resulted in widespread but inaccurate reports by the British media that Marmite had been banned by the Danish authorities. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration stated in 2015 that Marmite had not been banned in the country, but that fortified foods need to be tested for safety and approved before they can be marketed in the country. The issue was resolved in 2016, after the completion of a 2014 supplier-requested test.

=== Canada ===
On 24 January 2014, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency was noted, in a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation story, as preparing to stop the sale of Marmite, as well as Vegemite and Ovaltine, in Canada because they were enriched with vitamins and minerals which were not listed by Canadian food regulations. The agency said the products were not a health hazard.
The CFIA later specified that these specific items had been seized because they were not the versions that are formulated for sale in Canada and which satisfy all Canadian food regulations. Canadian versions of Marmite and the other products would still be permitted to be sold in Canada.

=== South Africa ===
Marmite is manufactured by licence in South Africa by Pioneer Foods in its traditional form.

South Africa also produces a bottled, long-life Marmite-flavoured cheese spread. It is light in texture and contains a hint of Marmite.

== Special editions ==
In 2002, a 100th anniversary jar was released.

In February 2007, Marmite produced a limited edition Guinness Marmite of 300,000 jars of 250 g of their yeast extract with 30% Guinness yeast, giving it a noticeable hint of &quot;Guinness&quot; flavour. In January 2008 Champagne Marmite was released for Valentine&#x27;s Day, with a limited-edition production of 600,000 units initially released exclusively to Selfridges of London. The product had 0.3% champagne added to the recipe, and a modified heart-shaped label with &quot;I love you&quot; in place of the logo.

In 2009, a limited edition Marston&#x27;s Pedigree Marmite was initiated to celebrate the 2009 Ashes Cricket test series.

In March 2010, a &quot;super-strength&quot; version of Marmite was released, called Marmite XO (XO standing for &quot;extra old&quot;). Marmite XO is matured for 28 days, four times longer than usual. The original Marmite XO&#x27;s cap was black, and has a black and gold label. In July 2019, Marmite XO returned due to popular demand. The 2019 version has an off-white cap as opposed to the original black.

In April 2012, a special-edition jar in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II was released. With the product renamed &quot;Ma&#x27;amite&quot;, the redesigned label featured a colour scheme based upon the Union Jack; the marmite and spoon logo replaced by a gold crown, and with a red rather than yellow cap. The front label also declares &quot;Made with 100% British Yeast&quot;. Coinciding with the 110th anniversary of the brand, production was limited to 300,000 jars. For Christmas 2012 a gold limited edition was begun, containing edible gold-coloured flecks.

Marmite chocolate is also available.

In 2015, Marmite Summer of Love Special Edition featured a flower power-themed label. This special edition&#x27;s blend had a lighter taste made using 100% lager yeast.

On 25 March 2019, Marmite Peanut Butter was introduced, which (as the title implied) combined the taste of Marmite with that of crunchy peanut butter.

On 2 May 2022, Marmite Truffle was launched and sold exclusively in Sainsburys, along with Marmite &#x27;Dynamite&#x27;, a chilli-flavoured Marmite spread. The Marmite Truffle was marketed with a variation of the &#x27;Love it Or Hate It&#x27; slogan designed to make it sound more sophisticated: &quot;One either loves it or considers it utterly vulgar&quot;.

<doc id="20092" wikidata="Q1638513" url="?curid=20092" title="Mabon ap Modron">
<text>Mabon ap Modron is a prominent figure from Welsh and wider Brythonic literature and mythology, the son of Modron and a member of Arthur&#x27;s war band. Both he and his mother were likely deities in origin, descending from a divine mother–son pair. He is often equated with the Demetian hero Pryderi fab Pwyll, and may be associated with the minor Arthurian character Mabon ab Mellt.

==Etymology==
His name is related to the Romano-British god Maponos, whose name means &quot;Great Son&quot;; Modron, in turn, is likely related to the Gaulish goddess Dea Matrona. The name &quot;Mabon&quot; is derived from the Common Brittonic and Gaulish deity name &quot;Maponos&quot; &quot;Great Son&quot;, from the Proto-Celtic root &quot;*makwo-&quot; &quot;son&quot;. Similarly, Modron is derived from the name of the Brittonic and Gaulish deity &quot;Mātronā&quot;, meaning &quot;Great Mother&quot;, from Proto-Celtic &quot;*mātīr&quot; &quot;mother&quot;.

==Role in Welsh tradition==

===&quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;===

Culhwch&#x27;s father, King Cilydd, the son of Celyddon, loses his wife Goleuddydd after a difficult childbirth. When he remarries, the young Culhwch rejects his stepmother&#x27;s attempt to pair him with his new stepsister. Offended, the new queen puts a curse on him so that he can marry no one besides the beautiful Olwen, daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden. Though he has never seen her, Culhwch becomes infatuated with her, but his father warns him that he will never find her without the aid of his famous cousin Arthur. The young man immediately sets off to seek his kinsman. He finds him at his court in Celliwig in Cornwall and asks for support and assistance. Cai is the first knight to volunteer to assist Culhwch in his quest, promising to stand by his side until Olwen is found. A further five knights join them in their mission.

They travel onwards until they come across the &quot;fairest of the castles of the world&quot;, and meet Ysbaddaden&#x27;s shepherd brother, Custennin. They learn that the castle belongs to Ysbaddaden, that he stripped Custennin of his lands and murdered the shepherd&#x27;s twenty-three children out of cruelty. Custennin sets up a meeting between Culhwch and Olwen, and the maiden agrees to lead Culhwch and his companions to Ysbadadden&#x27;s castle. Cai pledges to protect the twenty-fourth son, Goreu, with his life.

The knights attack the castle by stealth, killing the nine porters and the nine watchdogs, and enter the giant&#x27;s hall. Upon their arrival, Ysbaddaden attempts to kill Culhwch with a poison dart, but is outwitted and wounded, first by Bedwyr, then by the enchanter Menw, and finally by Culhwch himself. Eventually, Ysbaddaden relents, and agrees to give Culhwch his daughter on the condition that he completes a number of impossible tasks (&quot;anoethau&quot;), including hunting the Twrch Trwyth and recovering the exalted prisoner, Mabon son of Modron, the only man able to hunt the dog Drudwyn, in turn the only dog who can track the Twrch Trwyth.

Arthur and his men learn that Mabon was stolen from his mother&#x27;s arms when he was three nights old, and question the world&#x27;s oldest and wisest animals about his whereabouts, until they are led to the salmon of Llyn Llyw, the oldest animal of them all. The enormous salmon carries Arthur&#x27;s men Cei and Bedwyr downstream to Mabon&#x27;s prison in Gloucester; they hear him through the walls, singing a lamentation for his fate. The rest of Arthur&#x27;s men launch an assault on the front of the prison, while Cei and Bedwyr sneak in the back and rescue Mabon. He subsequently plays a key role in the hunt for the Twrch Trwyth.

===Other appearances===
One of the earliest direct reference to Mabon can be found in the tenth century poem &quot;Pa Gur&quot;, in which Arthur recounts the feats and achievements of his knights so as to gain entrance to a fortress guarded by Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr, the eponymous porter. The poem relates that Mabon fab Mydron (a misspelling of Modron) is one of Arthur&#x27;s followers, and is described as a &quot;servant to Uther Pendragon&quot;. A second figure, Mabon fab Mellt, is described as having &quot;stained the grass with blood&quot;. He further appears in the medieval tale &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot;, in which he fights alongside Arthur at the Battle of Badon and is described as one of the king&#x27;s chief advisors.

Mabon is almost certainly related to the continental Arthurian figures Mabonagrain, Mabuz, Nabon le Noir and Maboun.

<doc id="20097" wikidata="Q127995" url="?curid=20097" title="Microwave">
<text>Microwave is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths shorter than other radio waves but longer than infrared waves. Its wavelength ranges from about one meter to one millimeter, corresponding to frequencies between 300 MHz and 300 GHz, broadly construed. A more common definition in radio-frequency engineering is the range between 1 and 100 GHz (wavelengths between 30 cm and 3 mm), or between 1 and 3000 GHz (30 cm and 0.1 mm).
The prefix &quot;&quot; in &quot;microwave&quot; is not meant to suggest a wavelength in the micrometer range; rather, it indicates that microwaves are small (having shorter wavelengths), compared to the radio waves used in prior radio technology.

The boundaries between far infrared, terahertz radiation, microwaves, and ultra-high-frequency (UHF) are fairly arbitrary and are used variously between different fields of study.
In all cases, microwaves include the entire super high frequency (SHF) band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum. A broader definition includes UHF and extremely high frequency (EHF) (millimeter wave; 30 to 300 GHz) bands as well.

Frequencies in the microwave range are often referred to by their IEEE radar band designations: S, C, X, Ku, K, or Ka band, or by similar NATO or EU designations.

Microwaves travel by line-of-sight; unlike lower frequency radio waves, they do not diffract around hills, follow the earth&#x27;s surface as ground waves, or reflect from the ionosphere, so terrestrial microwave communication links are limited by the visual horizon to about . At the high end of the band, they are absorbed by gases in the atmosphere, limiting practical communication distances to around a kilometer.

Microwaves are widely used in modern technology, for example in point-to-point communication links, wireless networks, microwave radio relay networks, radar, satellite and spacecraft communication, medical diathermy and cancer treatment, remote sensing, radio astronomy, particle accelerators, spectroscopy, industrial heating, collision avoidance systems, garage door openers and keyless entry systems, and for cooking food in microwave ovens.

== Electromagnetic spectrum ==
Microwaves occupy a place in the electromagnetic spectrum with frequency above ordinary radio waves, and below infrared light:

In descriptions of the electromagnetic spectrum, some sources classify microwaves as radio waves, a subset of the radio wave band, while others classify microwaves and radio waves as distinct types of radiation. This is an arbitrary distinction.

=== Frequency bands ===
Bands of frequencies in the microwave spectrum are designated by letters. Unfortunately, there are several incompatible band designation systems, and even within a system the frequency ranges corresponding to some of the letters vary somewhat between different application fields. The letter system had its origin in World War 2 in a top-secret U.S. classification of bands used in radar sets; this is the origin of the oldest letter system, the IEEE radar bands. One set of microwave frequency bands designations by the Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB), is tabulated below:

Other definitions exist.

The term P band is sometimes used for UHF frequencies below the L band but is now obsolete per IEEE Std 521.

When radars were first developed at K band during World War 2, it was not known that there was a nearby absorption band (due to water vapor and oxygen in the atmosphere). To avoid this problem, the original K band was split into a lower band, Ku, and upper band, Ka.

== Propagation ==

Microwaves travel solely by line-of-sight paths; unlike lower frequency radio waves, they do not travel as ground waves which follow the contour of the Earth, or reflect off the ionosphere (skywaves). Although at the low end of the band, they can pass through building walls enough for useful reception, usually rights of way cleared to the first Fresnel zone are required. Therefore, on the surface of the Earth, microwave communication links are limited by the visual horizon to about . Microwaves are absorbed by moisture in the atmosphere, and the attenuation increases with frequency, becoming a significant factor (rain fade) at the high end of the band. Beginning at about 40 GHz, atmospheric gases also begin to absorb microwaves, so above this frequency microwave transmission is limited to a few kilometers. A spectral band structure causes absorption peaks at specific frequencies (see graph at right). Above 100 GHz, the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is so effective that it is in effect opaque, until the atmosphere becomes transparent again in the so-called infrared and optical window frequency ranges.

=== Troposcatter ===

In a microwave beam directed at an angle into the sky, a small amount of the power will be randomly scattered as the beam passes through the troposphere. A sensitive receiver beyond the horizon with a high gain antenna focused on that area of the troposphere can pick up the signal. This technique has been used at frequencies between 0.45 and 5 GHz in tropospheric scatter (troposcatter) communication systems to communicate beyond the horizon, at distances up to 300 km.

== Antennas ==
The short wavelengths of microwaves allow omnidirectional antennas for portable devices to be made very small, from 1 to 20 centimeters long, so microwave frequencies are widely used for wireless devices such as cell phones, cordless phones, and wireless LANs (Wi-Fi) access for laptops, and Bluetooth earphones. Antennas used include short whip antennas, rubber ducky antennas, sleeve dipoles, patch antennas, and increasingly the printed circuit inverted F antenna (PIFA) used in cell phones.

Their short wavelength also allows narrow beams of microwaves to be produced by conveniently small high gain antennas from a half meter to 5 meters in diameter. Therefore, beams of microwaves are used for point-to-point communication links, and for radar. An advantage of narrow beams is that they do not interfere with nearby equipment using the same frequency, allowing frequency reuse by nearby transmitters. Parabolic (&quot;dish&quot;) antennas are the most widely used directive antennas at microwave frequencies, but horn antennas, slot antennas and lens antennas are also used. Flat microstrip antennas are being increasingly used in consumer devices. Another directive antenna practical at microwave frequencies is the phased array, a computer-controlled array of antennas that produces a beam that can be electronically steered in different directions.

At microwave frequencies, the transmission lines which are used to carry lower frequency radio waves to and from antennas, such as coaxial cable and parallel wire lines, have excessive power losses, so when low attenuation is required, microwaves are carried by metal pipes called waveguides. Due to the high cost and maintenance requirements of waveguide runs, in many microwave antennas the output stage of the transmitter or the RF front end of the receiver is located at the antenna.

== Design and analysis ==
The term &quot;microwave&quot; also has a more technical meaning in electromagnetics and circuit theory. Apparatus and techniques may be described qualitatively as &quot;microwave&quot; when the wavelengths of signals are roughly the same as the dimensions of the circuit, so that lumped-element circuit theory is inaccurate, and instead distributed circuit elements and transmission-line theory are more useful methods for design and analysis.

As a consequence, practical microwave circuits tend to move away from the discrete resistors, capacitors, and inductors used with lower-frequency radio waves. Open-wire and coaxial transmission lines used at lower frequencies are replaced by waveguides and stripline, and lumped-element tuned circuits are replaced by cavity resonators or resonant stubs. In turn, at even higher frequencies, where the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves becomes small in comparison to the size of the structures used to process them, microwave techniques become inadequate, and the methods of optics are used.

== Sources ==

High-power microwave sources use specialized vacuum tubes to generate microwaves. These devices operate on different principles from low-frequency vacuum tubes, using the ballistic motion of electrons in a vacuum under the influence of controlling electric or magnetic fields, and include the magnetron (used in microwave ovens), klystron, traveling-wave tube (TWT), and gyrotron. These devices work in the density modulated mode, rather than the current modulated mode. This means that they work on the basis of clumps of electrons flying ballistically through them, rather than using a continuous stream of electrons.

Low-power microwave sources use solid-state devices such as the field-effect transistor (at least at lower frequencies), tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes, and IMPATT diodes. Low-power sources are available as benchtop instruments, rackmount instruments, embeddable modules and in card-level formats. A maser is a solid-state device that amplifies microwaves using similar principles to the laser, which amplifies higher-frequency light waves.

All warm objects emit low level microwave black-body radiation, depending on their temperature, so in meteorology and remote sensing, microwave radiometers are used to measure the temperature of objects or terrain. The sun and other astronomical radio sources such as Cassiopeia A emit low level microwave radiation which carries information about their makeup, which is studied by radio astronomers using receivers called radio telescopes. The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), for example, is a weak microwave noise filling empty space which is a major source of information on cosmology&#x27;s Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe.

== Applications ==

Microwave technology is extensively used for point-to-point telecommunications (i.e., non-broadcast uses). Microwaves are especially suitable for this use since they are more easily focused into narrower beams than radio waves, allowing frequency reuse; their comparatively higher frequencies allow broad bandwidth and high data transmission rates, and antenna sizes are smaller than at lower frequencies because antenna size is inversely proportional to the transmitted frequency. Microwaves are used in spacecraft communication, and much of the world&#x27;s data, TV, and telephone communications are transmitted long distances by microwaves between ground stations and communications satellites. Microwaves are also employed in microwave ovens and in radar technology.

=== Communication ===

Before the advent of fiber-optic transmission, most long-distance telephone calls were carried via networks of microwave radio relay links run by carriers such as AT&amp;T Long Lines. Starting in the early 1950s, frequency-division multiplexing was used to send up to 5,400 telephone channels on each microwave radio channel, with as many as ten radio channels combined into one antenna for the &quot;hop&quot; to the next site, up to 70 km away.

Wireless LAN protocols, such as Bluetooth and the IEEE 802.11 specifications used for Wi-Fi, also use microwaves in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, although 802.11a uses ISM band and U-NII frequencies in the 5 GHz range. Licensed long-range (up to about 25 km) Wireless Internet Access services have been used for almost a decade in many countries in the 3.5–4.0 GHz range. The FCC recently carved out spectrum for carriers that wish to offer services in this range in the U.S. — with emphasis on 3.65 GHz. Dozens of service providers across the country are securing or have already received licenses from the FCC to operate in this band. The WIMAX service offerings that can be carried on the 3.65 GHz band will give business customers another option for connectivity.

Metropolitan area network (MAN) protocols, such as WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) are based on standards such as IEEE 802.16, designed to operate between 2 and 11 GHz. Commercial implementations are in the 2.3 GHz, 2.5 GHz, 3.5 GHz and 5.8 GHz ranges.

Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) protocols based on standards specifications such as IEEE 802.20 or ATIS/ANSI HC-SDMA (such as iBurst) operate between 1.6 and 2.3 GHz to give mobility and in-building penetration characteristics similar to mobile phones but with vastly greater spectral efficiency.

Some mobile phone networks, like GSM, use the low-microwave/high-UHF frequencies around 1.8 and 1.9 GHz in the Americas and elsewhere, respectively. DVB-SH and S-DMB use 1.452 to 1.492 GHz, while proprietary/incompatible satellite radio in the U.S. uses around 2.3 GHz for DARS.

Microwave radio is used in point-to-point telecommunications transmissions because, due to their short wavelength, highly directional antennas are smaller and therefore more practical than they would be at longer wavelengths (lower frequencies). There is also more bandwidth in the microwave spectrum than in the rest of the radio spectrum; the usable bandwidth below 300 MHz is less than 300 MHz while many GHz can be used above 300 MHz. Typically, microwaves are used in remote broadcasting of news or sports events as the backhaul link to transmit a signal from a remote location to a television station from a specially equipped van. See broadcast auxiliary service (BAS), remote pickup unit (RPU), and studio/transmitter link (STL).

Most satellite communications systems operate in the C, X, Ka, or Ku bands of the microwave spectrum. These frequencies allow large bandwidth while avoiding the crowded UHF frequencies and staying below the atmospheric absorption of EHF frequencies. Satellite TV either operates in the C band for the traditional large dish fixed satellite service or Ku band for direct-broadcast satellite. Military communications run primarily over X or Ku-band links, with Ka band being used for Milstar.

=== Navigation ===

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) including the Chinese Beidou, the American Global Positioning System (introduced in 1978) and the Russian GLONASS broadcast navigational signals in various bands between about 1.2 GHz and 1.6 GHz.

=== Radar ===

Radar is a radiolocation technique in which a beam of radio waves emitted by a transmitter bounces off an object and returns to a receiver, allowing the location, range, speed, and other characteristics of the object to be determined. The short wavelength of microwaves causes large reflections from objects the size of motor vehicles, ships and aircraft. Also, at these wavelengths, the high gain antennas such as parabolic antennas which are required to produce the narrow beamwidths needed to accurately locate objects are conveniently small, allowing them to be rapidly turned to scan for objects. Therefore, microwave frequencies are the main frequencies used in radar. Microwave radar is widely used for applications such as air traffic control, weather forecasting, navigation of ships, and speed limit enforcement. Long-distance radars use the lower microwave frequencies since at the upper end of the band atmospheric absorption limits the range, but millimeter waves are used for short-range radar such as collision avoidance systems.

=== Radio astronomy ===
Microwaves emitted by astronomical radio sources; planets, stars, galaxies, and nebulas are studied in radio astronomy with large dish antennas called radio telescopes. In addition to receiving naturally occurring microwave radiation, radio telescopes have been used in active radar experiments to bounce microwaves off planets in the solar system, to determine the distance to the Moon or map the invisible surface of Venus through cloud cover.

A recently completed microwave radio telescope is the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, located at more than 5,000 meters (16,597 ft) altitude in Chile, which observes the universe in the millimeter and submillimeter wavelength ranges. The world&#x27;s largest ground-based astronomy project to date, it consists of more than 66 dishes and was built in an international collaboration by Europe, North America, East Asia and Chile.

A major recent focus of microwave radio astronomy has been mapping the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) discovered in 1964 by radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. This faint background radiation, which fills the universe and is almost the same in all directions, is &quot;relic radiation&quot; from the Big Bang, and is one of the few sources of information about conditions in the early universe. Due to the expansion and thus cooling of the Universe, the originally high-energy radiation has been shifted into the microwave region of the radio spectrum. Sufficiently sensitive radio telescopes can detect the CMBR as a faint signal that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object.

=== Heating and power application ===
A microwave oven passes microwave radiation at a frequency near  through food, causing dielectric heating primarily by absorption of the energy in water. Microwave ovens became common kitchen appliances in Western countries in the late 1970s, following the development of less expensive cavity magnetrons. Water in the liquid state possesses many molecular interactions that broaden the absorption peak. In the vapor phase, isolated water molecules absorb at around 22 GHz, almost ten times the frequency of the microwave oven.

Microwave heating is used in industrial processes for drying and curing products.

Many semiconductor processing techniques use microwaves to generate plasma for such purposes as reactive ion etching and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).

Microwaves are used in stellarators and tokamak experimental fusion reactors to help break down the gas into a plasma and heat it to very high temperatures. The frequency is tuned to the cyclotron resonance of the electrons in the magnetic field, anywhere between 2–200 GHz, hence it is often referred to as Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH). The upcoming ITER thermonuclear reactor will use up to 20 MW of 170 GHz microwaves.

Microwaves can be used to transmit power over long distances, and post-World War 2 research was done to examine possibilities. NASA worked in the 1970s and early 1980s to research the possibilities of using solar power satellite (SPS) systems with large solar arrays that would beam power down to the Earth&#x27;s surface via microwaves.

Less-than-lethal weaponry exists that uses millimeter waves to heat a thin layer of human skin to an intolerable temperature so as to make the targeted person move away. A two-second burst of the 95 GHz focused beam heats the skin to a temperature of at a depth of . The United States Air Force and Marines are currently using this type of active denial system in fixed installations.

=== Spectroscopy ===

Microwave radiation is used in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR or ESR) spectroscopy, typically in the X-band region (~9 GHz) in conjunction typically with magnetic fields of 0.3 T. This technique provides information on unpaired electrons in chemical systems, such as free radicals or transition metal ions such as Cu(II). Microwave radiation is also used to perform rotational spectroscopy and can be combined with electrochemistry as in microwave enhanced electrochemistry.

== Frequency measurement ==
Microwave frequency can be measured by either electronic or mechanical techniques.

Frequency counters or high frequency heterodyne systems can be used. Here the unknown frequency is compared with harmonics of a known lower frequency by use of a low-frequency generator, a harmonic generator and a mixer. The accuracy of the measurement is limited by the accuracy and stability of the reference source.

Mechanical methods require a tunable resonator such as an absorption wavemeter, which has a known relation between a physical dimension and frequency.

In a laboratory setting, Lecher lines can be used to directly measure the wavelength on a transmission line made of parallel wires, the frequency can then be calculated. A similar technique is to use a slotted waveguide or slotted coaxial line to directly measure the wavelength. These devices consist of a probe introduced into the line through a longitudinal slot so that the probe is free to travel up and down the line. Slotted lines are primarily intended for measurement of the voltage standing wave ratio on the line. However, provided a standing wave is present, they may also be used to measure the distance between the nodes, which is equal to half the wavelength. The precision of this method is limited by the determination of the nodal locations.

== Effects on health ==
Microwaves are non-ionizing radiation, which means that microwave photons do not contain sufficient energy to ionize molecules or break chemical bonds, or cause DNA damage, as ionizing radiation such as x-rays or ultraviolet can. The word &quot;radiation&quot; refers to energy radiating from a source and not to radioactivity. The main effect of absorption of microwaves is to heat materials; the electromagnetic fields cause polar molecules to vibrate. It has not been shown conclusively that microwaves (or other non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation) have significant adverse biological effects at low levels. Some, but not all, studies suggest that long-term exposure may have a carcinogenic effect.

During World War II, it was observed that individuals in the radiation path of radar installations experienced clicks and buzzing sounds in response to microwave radiation. Research by NASA in the 1970s has shown this to be caused by thermal expansion in parts of the inner ear. In 1955, Dr. James Lovelock was able to reanimate rats chilled to using microwave diathermy.

When injury from exposure to microwaves occurs, it usually results from dielectric heating induced in the body. The lens and cornea of the eye are especially vulnerable because they contain no blood vessels that can carry away heat. Exposure to microwave radiation can produce cataracts by this mechanism, because the microwave heating denatures proteins in the crystalline lens of the eye (in the same way that heat turns egg whites white and opaque). Exposure to heavy doses of microwave radiation (as from an oven that has been tampered with to allow operation even with the door open) can produce heat damage in other tissues as well, up to and including serious burns that may not be immediately evident because of the tendency for microwaves to heat deeper tissues with higher moisture content.

== History ==
===Hertzian optics===
Microwaves were first generated in the 1890s in some of the earliest radio wave experiments by physicists who thought of them as a form of &quot;invisible light&quot;. James Clerk Maxwell in his 1873 theory of electromagnetism, now called Maxwell&#x27;s equations, had predicted that a coupled electric field and magnetic field could travel through space as an electromagnetic wave, and proposed that light consisted of electromagnetic waves of short wavelength. In 1888, German physicist Heinrich Hertz was the first to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves, generating radio waves using a primitive spark gap radio transmitter.

Hertz and the other early radio researchers were interested in exploring the similarities between radio waves and light waves, to test Maxwell&#x27;s theory. They concentrated on producing short wavelength radio waves in the UHF and microwave ranges, with which they could duplicate classic optics experiments in their laboratories, using quasioptical components such as prisms and lenses made of paraffin, sulfur and pitch and wire diffraction gratings, to refract and diffract radio waves like light rays. Hertz produced waves up to 450 MHz; his directional 450 MHz transmitter consisted of a 26 cm brass rod dipole antenna with a spark gap between the ends, suspended at the focal line of a parabolic antenna made of a curved zinc sheet, powered by high voltage pulses from an induction coil. His historic experiments demonstrated that radio waves like light exhibited refraction, diffraction, polarization, interference and standing waves, proving that radio waves and light waves were both forms of Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic waves.
Beginning in 1894 Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose performed the first experiments with microwaves. He was the first person to produce millimeter waves, generating frequencies up to 60 GHz (5 millimeter) using a 3 mm metal ball spark oscillator. Bose also invented waveguide, horn antennas, and semiconductor crystal detectors for use in his experiments. Independently in 1894, Oliver Lodge and Augusto Righi experimented with 1.5 and 12 GHz microwaves respectively, generated by small metal ball spark resonators. Russian physicist Pyotr Lebedev in 1895 generated 50 GHz millimeter waves. In 1897 Lord Rayleigh solved the mathematical boundary-value problem of electromagnetic waves propagating through conducting tubes and dielectric rods of arbitrary shape which gave the modes and cutoff frequency of microwaves propagating through a waveguide.

However, since microwaves were limited to line-of-sight paths, they could not communicate beyond the visual horizon, and the low power of the spark transmitters then in use limited their practical range to a few miles. The subsequent development of radio communication after 1896 employed lower frequencies, which could travel beyond the horizon as ground waves and by reflecting off the ionosphere as skywaves, and microwave frequencies were not further explored at this time.

===First microwave communication experiments===
Practical use of microwave frequencies did not occur until the 1940s and 1950s due to a lack of adequate sources, since the triode vacuum tube (valve) electronic oscillator used in radio transmitters could not produce frequencies above a few hundred megahertz due to excessive electron transit time and interelectrode capacitance. By the 1930s, the first low-power microwave vacuum tubes had been developed using new principles; the Barkhausen–Kurz tube and the split-anode magnetron. These could generate a few watts of power at frequencies up to a few gigahertz and were used in the first experiments in communication with microwaves.
In 1931 an Anglo-French consortium headed by Andre C. Clavier demonstrated the first experimental microwave relay link, across the English Channel between Dover, UK and Calais, France. The system transmitted telephony, telegraph and facsimile data over bidirectional 1.7 GHz beams with a power of one-half watt, produced by miniature Barkhausen–Kurz tubes at the focus of metal dishes.

A word was needed to distinguish these new shorter wavelengths, which had previously been lumped into the &quot;short wave&quot; band, which meant all waves shorter than 200 meters. The terms &quot;quasi-optical waves&quot; and &quot;ultrashort waves&quot; were used briefly but did not catch on. The first usage of the word &quot;micro-wave&quot; apparently occurred in 1931.

===Radar development===
The development of radar, mainly in secrecy, before and during World War II, resulted in the technological advances which made microwaves practical. Microwave wavelengths in the centimeter range were required to give the small radar antennas which were compact enough to fit on aircraft a narrow enough beamwidth to localize enemy aircraft. It was found that conventional transmission lines used to carry radio waves had excessive power losses at microwave frequencies, and George Southworth at Bell Labs and Wilmer Barrow at MIT independently invented waveguide in 1936. Barrow invented the horn antenna in 1938 as a means to efficiently radiate microwaves into or out of a waveguide. In a microwave receiver, a nonlinear component was needed that would act as a detector and mixer at these frequencies, as vacuum tubes had too much capacitance. To fill this need researchers resurrected an obsolete technology, the point contact crystal detector (cat whisker detector) which was used as a demodulator in crystal radios around the turn of the century before vacuum tube receivers. The low capacitance of semiconductor junctions allowed them to function at microwave frequencies. The first modern silicon and germanium diodes were developed as microwave detectors in the 1930s, and the principles of semiconductor physics learned during their development led to semiconductor electronics after the war.

The first powerful sources of microwaves were invented at the beginning of World War II: the klystron tube by Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford University in 1937, and the cavity magnetron tube by John Randall and Harry Boot at Birmingham University, UK in 1940. Ten centimeter (3 GHz) microwave radar powered by the magnetron tube was in use on British warplanes in late 1941 and proved to be a game changer. Britain&#x27;s 1940 decision to share its microwave technology with its US ally (the Tizard Mission) significantly shortened the war. The MIT Radiation Laboratory established secretly at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1940 to research radar, produced much of the theoretical knowledge necessary to use microwaves. The first microwave relay systems were developed by the Allied military near the end of the war and used for secure battlefield communication networks in the European theater.

===Post World War II exploitation===
After World War II, microwaves were rapidly exploited commercially. Due to their high frequency they had a very large information-carrying capacity (bandwidth); a single microwave beam could carry tens of thousands of phone calls. In the 1950s and 60s transcontinental microwave relay networks were built in the US and Europe to exchange telephone calls between cities and distribute television programs. In the new television broadcasting industry, from the 1940s microwave dishes were used to transmit backhaul video feeds from mobile production trucks back to the studio, allowing the first remote TV broadcasts. The first communications satellites were launched in the 1960s, which relayed telephone calls and television between widely separated points on Earth using microwave beams. In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson while investigating noise in a satellite horn antenna at Bell Labs, Holmdel, New Jersey discovered cosmic microwave background radiation.

Microwave radar became the central technology used in air traffic control, maritime navigation, anti-aircraft defense, ballistic missile detection, and later many other uses. Radar and satellite communication motivated the development of modern microwave antennas; the parabolic antenna (the most common type), cassegrain antenna, lens antenna, slot antenna, and phased array.

The ability of short waves to quickly heat materials and cook food had been investigated in the 1930s by Ilia E. Mouromtseff at Westinghouse, and at the 1933 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair demonstrated cooking meals with a 60 MHz radio transmitter. In 1945 Percy Spencer, an engineer working on radar at Raytheon, noticed that microwave radiation from a magnetron oscillator melted a candy bar in his pocket. He investigated cooking with microwaves and invented the microwave oven, consisting of a magnetron feeding microwaves into a closed metal cavity containing food, which was patented by Raytheon on 8 October 1945. Due to their expense microwave ovens were initially used in institutional kitchens, but by 1986 roughly 25% of households in the U.S. owned one. Microwave heating became widely used as an industrial process in industries such as plastics fabrication, and as a medical therapy to kill cancer cells in microwave hyperthermy.

The traveling wave tube (TWT) developed in 1943 by Rudolph Kompfner and John Pierce provided a high-power tunable source of microwaves up to 50 GHz and became the most widely used microwave tube (besides the ubiquitous magnetron used in microwave ovens). The gyrotron tube family developed in Russia could produce megawatts of power up into millimeter wave frequencies and is used in industrial heating and plasma research, and to power particle accelerators and nuclear fusion reactors.

===Solid state microwave devices===
The development of semiconductor electronics in the 1950s led to the first solid state microwave devices which worked by a new principle; negative resistance (some of the prewar microwave tubes had also used negative resistance). The feedback oscillator and two-port amplifiers which were used at lower frequencies became unstable at microwave frequencies, and negative resistance oscillators and amplifiers based on one-port devices like diodes worked better.

The tunnel diode invented in 1957 by Japanese physicist Leo Esaki could produce a few milliwatts of microwave power. Its invention set off a search for better negative resistance semiconductor devices for use as microwave oscillators, resulting in the invention of the IMPATT diode in 1956 by W.T. Read and Ralph L. Johnston and the Gunn diode in 1962 by J. B. Gunn. Diodes are the most widely used microwave sources today.

Two low-noise solid state negative resistance microwave amplifiers were developed; the maser invented in 1953 by Charles H. Townes, James P. Gordon, and H. J. Zeiger, and the varactor parametric amplifier developed in 1956 by Marion Hines. The parametric amplifier and the ruby maser, invented in 1958 by a team at Bell Labs headed by H.E.D. Scovil were used for low noise microwave receivers in radio telescopes and satellite ground stations. The maser led to the development of atomic clocks, which keep time using a precise microwave frequency emitted by atoms undergoing an electron transition between two energy levels. Negative resistance amplifier circuits required the invention of new nonreciprocal waveguide components, such as circulators, isolators, and directional couplers. In 1969 Kaneyuki Kurokawa derived mathematical conditions for stability in negative resistance circuits which formed the basis of microwave oscillator design.

===Microwave integrated circuits===

Prior to the 1970s microwave devices and circuits were bulky and expensive, so microwave frequencies were generally limited to the output stage of transmitters and the RF front end of receivers, and signals were heterodyned to a lower intermediate frequency for processing. The period from the 1970s to the present has seen the development of tiny inexpensive active solid-state microwave components which can be mounted on circuit boards, allowing circuits to perform significant signal processing at microwave frequencies. This has made possible satellite television, cable television, GPS devices, and modern wireless devices, such as smartphones, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth which connect to networks using microwaves.

Microstrip, a type of transmission line usable at microwave frequencies, was invented with printed circuits in the 1950s. The ability to cheaply fabricate a wide range of shapes on printed circuit boards allowed microstrip versions of capacitors, inductors, resonant stubs, splitters, directional couplers, diplexers, filters and antennas to be made, thus allowing compact microwave circuits to be constructed.

Transistors that operated at microwave frequencies were developed in the 1970s. The semiconductor gallium arsenide (GaAs) has a much higher electron mobility than silicon, so devices fabricated with this material can operate at 4 times the frequency of similar devices of silicon. Beginning in the 1970s GaAs was used to make the first microwave transistors, and it has dominated microwave semiconductors ever since. MESFETs (metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors), fast GaAs field effect transistors using Schottky junctions for the gate, were developed starting in 1968 and have reached cutoff frequencies of 100 GHz, and are now the most widely used active microwave devices. Another family of transistors with a higher frequency limit is the HEMT (high electron mobility transistor), a field effect transistor made with two different semiconductors, AlGaAs and GaAs, using heterojunction technology, and the similar HBT (heterojunction bipolar transistor).

GaAs can be made semi-insulating, allowing it to be used as a substrate on which circuits containing passive components, as well as transistors, can be fabricated by lithography. By 1976 this led to the first integrated circuits (ICs) which functioned at microwave frequencies, called monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC). The word &quot;monolithic&quot; was added to distinguish these from microstrip PCB circuits, which were called &quot;microwave integrated circuits&quot; (MIC). Since then, silicon MMICs have also been developed. Today MMICs have become the workhorses of both analog and digital high-frequency electronics, enabling the production of single-chip microwave receivers, broadband amplifiers, modems, and microprocessors.

Originally from the Gold Coast, Queensland, Doohan attended St Joseph&#x27;s College, Gregory Terrace and Aspley State High School, Brisbane.

Late in the 1990 season Doohan claimed his first victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix on his way to third in the championship. In 1991, he was paired with his fellow Australian Wayne Gardner on a Honda RVF750 superbike and won the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race. He competed successfully throughout the early 1990s and appeared to be on his way to winning his first world championship when he was seriously injured in a practice crash before the 1992 Dutch TT. He suffered permanent and serious damage to his right leg due to medical complications and, at one stage, faced amputation of the leg. At the time, Doohan was 65 points in the lead of the championship, but could not compete for eight weeks after the crash. After an arduous recovery, he returned to racing for the final two races but could not prevent Yamaha rider Wayne Rainey from winning his third consecutive title (by four points from Doohan). In 1993 he struggled with the healing of his leg and the ability to race the Honda at elite level, stating later that in that year it was all he could do to just keep his ride at Honda. It was also during this time he switched to a left thumb-operated rear brake, as his right foot is no longer able to perform this function.

In 1994 however, he won his first 500 cc World Championship. Thereafter, until 1998, he dominated the class, winning five consecutive 500 cc World Championships. In 1997, his most successful year, Doohan won 12 out of 15 races, finished second in another two, and crashed out of the final race of the season at his home GP while leading by more than six seconds. In the 1996 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Doohan was inducted as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his contribution to the sport of motor racing.

Despite up to eight rivals on non-factory HRC Honda motorcycles Doohan&#x27;s margin of superiority over them was such that in many races Doohan would build a comfortable lead and then ride well within his limits to cruise to victory. Although pure riding skill clearly played a large part in his success, the ability of his chief race engineer, Jeremy Burgess, to perfect the suspension and geometry of a racing motorcycle may have given him an advantage over his rivals. Between 1994 and 1998 the bike was said not to have had many changes, with Honda engineers reportedly becoming frustrated at Doohan&#x27;s reluctance to try innovations such as electronic shifting (it was only when Rossi came to Honda in 2000 that Honda engineers had their head with Rossi willing to try more innovations).

One notable trait of Doohan&#x27;s post-crash riding style was the use of a thumb-operated rear brake developed during 1993 owing to the reduced range of motion in his ankle. This was operated by a &quot;nudge&quot; bar similar to a personal water craft throttle, but mounted on the left handlebar. In 1999 Doohan had another accident, this time in a very wet qualifying session for the Spanish Grand Prix. He again broke his leg in several places and subsequently announced his retirement. Jeremy Burgess, Doohan&#x27;s chief engineer for his entire career, later became Valentino Rossi&#x27;s chief engineer. After Doohan retired he went to work as a roving adviser to Honda&#x27;s Grand Prix race effort. At the conclusion of the 2004 season, Doohan and Honda parted company.

In June 2011, Doohan made an appearance at the Isle of Man TT. Doohan completed a parade lap, and was most enamored by the thrill and spectacle of the Snaefell Mountain Course. He then went on to pay tribute to his former Honda racing teammate, Joey Dunlop.

===Cars===

After his success in Grand Prix motorcycle racing he got a chance to test a Formula One race car, the Williams FW19, at Circuit de Catalunya (in Spain) in April 1998. He found the car difficult to drive and crashed against a guard rail. In 2001, Doohan drove a Mercedes Benz CLK55 AMG works rally car with his co-driver Mark Stacey in the 2001 Targa Tasmania rally. He was in thirteenth place on day three when he crashed the car; he and Stacey were uninjured after the incident.

==Personal life==
On 8 August 2006, Doohan appeared in Darwin Magistrates Court to face charges over a weekend fracas at a strip club. He was fined $2,500 after pleading guilty to assaulting a bouncer and failing to leave a licensed premise. No conviction was recorded.

Doohan married Selina Sines, who had been his partner for the previous eleven years, on Tuesday 21 March 2006, on Hamilton Island; the couple have two children, including racing driver Jack Doohan.

Doohan helped design an Intamin Motorbike Launch Roller Coaster, named Mick Doohan&#x27;s Motocoaster. The ride is located at Dreamworld on the Gold Coast, Queensland. Doohan&#x27;s name was removed from the ride&#x27;s branding in May 2022, and it is now known simply as Motocoaster.

==Honours==
Doohan was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1996 and received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000. He was awarded the &quot;Key to the City&quot; by the City of Gold Coast in 1997. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2009. The first turn at Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit is named after him.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Doohan was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as a &quot;sports legend&quot;.

<text>, also retrospectively known as First Gundam, Gundam 0079 or simply Gundam &#x27;79, is a Japanese anime television series produced Nippon Sunrise. Created and directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, it premiered in Japan on Nagoya Broadcasting Network and its affiliated ANN stations on April 7, 1979, and lasted until January 26, 1980, spanning 43 episodes. It was the first &quot;Gundam&quot; series, which has subsequently been adapted into numerous sequels and spin-offs. Set in the futuristic calendar year &quot;Universal Century&quot; 0079, the plot focuses on the war between the Principality of Zeon and the Earth Federation, with the latter unveiling a new giant robot known as the RX-78-2 Gundam piloted by the teenage civilian mechanic Amuro Ray.

In 1981, the series was re-edited for theatrical release and split into three films. The characters were designed by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, and Kunio Okawara was responsible for the mechanical designs, including the eponymous giant robot, the RX-78-2 Gundam. The first film was released on February 22, 1981. Tomino himself also wrote a trilogy of novels that retell the events of the series. Two manga adaptations of the series have also been written by two manga artists.

Despite initial low ratings that caused the series&#x27; cancellation, the popularity of &quot;Gundam&quot; saw a boost from the introduction of Bandai&#x27;s Gunpla models in 1980 and from reruns and the theatrical release of the anime, leading to the creation of a prolific and lucrative media and toy franchise. The series is famous for revolutionizing the giant robot genre due to the handling of mobile suits as weapons of war, as well as the portrayal of their pilots as ordinary soldiers. These aspects contrasted with the previous style of portraying hero pilots and their giant super hero robots.

==Plot==

Set in a fictional universe (Universal Century year 0079 according to the Gundam Calendar), the Principality of Zeon has declared independence from the Earth Federation, and subsequently launched a war of independence called the One Year War. The conflict has directly affected every continent on Earth, also nearly every space colony and lunar settlement. Zeon, though smaller, has the tactical upper hand through their use of a new type of humanoid weapons called mobile suits. After half of all humanity perishes in the conflict and much of Earth&#x27;s ecosystem, the war settled into a bitter stalemate lasting over eight months.

The story begins with a newly deployed Federation warship, the &quot;White Base&quot;, arriving at the secret research base located at the Side 7 colony to pick up the Federation&#x27;s newest weapon. However, they are closely followed by Zeon forces. A Zeon reconnaissance team member disobeys mission orders and attacks the colony, killing most of the Federation crew and civilians in the process. Out of desperation, young Amuro Ray accidentally finds the Federation&#x27;s new prototype arsenal—the RX-78 Gundam, and manages to beat back Zeon forces. Scrambling everything they can, the &quot;White Base&quot; sets out with her newly formed crew of civilian recruits and refugees in her journey to survive.

On their journey, the White Base members often encounter the Zeon Lieutenant Commander Char Aznable. Although Char antagonizes Amuro in battle, he takes advantage of their position as Federation members to have them kill members from Zeon&#x27;s Zabi family as part of his revenge scheme as he is the son of the original founder of Zeon and the nation&#x27;s namesake. Amuro also meets ensign Lalah Sune with whom he falls in love, but accidentally kills when facing Char. When the Federation Forces invade the Fortress of A Baoa Qu to defeat the Zeon forces, Amuro engages on a final one-on-one duel against Char due to each blaming the other for Lalah&#x27;s death. Having realized he forgot his true enemy, Char stops fighting to kill the last surviving Zabi member, Kycilia Zabi. Amuro then reunites with his comrades as the war reaches its end, leaving behind the Gundam as it was rendered inoperable after his battle.

==Production==

The &quot;Mobile Suits&quot; of the show were inspired by the powered armor from the novel &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; from 1959. Mobile suits were conceptualized as human-like robots which would not only appeal to children.

In previous series Tomino worked in, villains were alien agents. &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; was the first of his work which featured humans as antagonists. The director commented he wanted to tell a story about war. He aimed to expose through art the horrors of the Japanese wartime aggression in Manchuria in 1939. Tomino did not wish to revise history and wanted to use the story to force viewers to confront the tragic realities of war. The director was originally unwilling to discuss the message of his work, expecting the viewers to reach their own conclusion. Additionally, he commented he &quot;packed his frustrations&quot; when making &quot;Gundam&quot;.

Tomino met mechanical designer Kunio Okawara when he first worked in two television series from Sunrise. Tomino liked Okawara&#x27;s work and asked him to collaborate with him in his upcoming project. Originally, the anime would be called &quot;Gunboy&quot; but it was renamed &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. The &quot;White Base&quot;, the mothership of the protagonist crew members, is designed with a 3 plane view method by Kunio Okawara, however, it is not specially designed for the anime series Gundam, it was actually a salvaged design from the anime &quot;Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3&quot;. The idea of having a space carrier from Tomino is partly inspired by the earlier science fiction anime &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, which he claimed to be a fan of. It was intended to be in a more realistic black color, but was changed to white by the order of Sunrise, who similarly ordered the main mecha, Gundam, changed from a grayish white to white, red, blue and yellow. Director Tomino showed great disgust in the color change, also noticing the unrealistic non-aerodynamic design of it after the show was on air, said in an interview that such design would never appear in the real world, since it would be a sitting duck from fighter aircraft. Tomino still held a grudge 10 years after the show aired and stated in an interview in &quot;Newtype&quot; 1989 April issue that the imaginary enemies of Gundam are Sunrise, sponsors and television stations.

Tomino compares the machines with religious history in Japan, most notably the worship of Buddha statues located in temples. The relationship between the pilot and the mobile suit has also been compared with the Formula One drivers who rely on machines to achieve a goal. In order to give the mechas fast movements, most of the fights were situated in space where there was low gravity. This led to the creation of space colonies as a common setting. In order to explain how a person as young as Amuro could pilot the Gundam, the team came up with the idea of Newtypes.

==Media==

===Anime===

In February 1980, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; was aired in Italy, the first country to broadcast the show outside Japan. &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; was also later aired by the anime satellite television network, Animax, across Japan, with the series continuing to be aired on the network currently, and later its respective networks worldwide, including Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other regions.

Hoping to capitalize on the success of &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; from the previous year, Bandai Entertainment released a heavily edited and English-dubbed version of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, premiering on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami weekday afternoon after-school action programming block across the United States on Monday, July 23, 2001. The series did not do as well as &quot;Wing&quot; but the ratings were high enough for the whole series to be aired and to spawn an enormous toy line. Due to 9-11, Cartoon Network, like many other American TV stations, began pulling, and editing, war-themed content and violent programming, resulting in the cancellation of the series. However, the series finale was shown as part of Toonami&#x27;s &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve-il&quot; special on December 31, 2001. On Saturday, June 8, 2002, the series would later air on their late-night Adult Swim block, starting over from the first episode, but it was again pulled before completing its run because of low ratings.

On May 30, 2006, Bandai Entertainment re-released the English dub of the TV series in a 10 volume DVD set. There was no Japanese audio track included, apparently because Yoshiyuki Tomino felt that the original mono mix was in too poor of a condition to use. However, in 2007 the original series was released on DVD in Japan, which sold over 100,000 copies within a month&#x27;s time from December 21, 2007, to January 21, 2008.

Only one episode out of the 43 episodes (&quot;Cucuruz Doan&#x27;s Island&quot;) had never been dubbed nor aired. This was at the request of Yoshiyuki Tomino, as he felt that it was not on par with the other episodes, resulting in the episode becoming a &quot;lost episode&quot; of sorts. Despite this, the episode was included on Japanese DVD and Blu-ray releases, and was dubbed in Italian in the early 1980s.

At the 2010 New York Comic Con/New York Anime Festival, Bandai Entertainment announced that they would re-release &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; with both the original Japanese audio and the English dub. Bandai released it in two sets in the summer of 2011. The first set was released on September 13, 2011.

Following the closure in 2012 of Bandai Entertainment, the series went out of print. At their New York Comic Con 2014 panel, Sunrise announced their plans to re-release all of the &quot;Gundam&quot; series on home video in North America, starting with the original series. They would be distributed via Right Stuf Inc. They released the series on Blu-ray and DVD in October 2015.

On July 25, 2015, British anime distributor Anime Limited announced they would release &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; in cooperation with Sunrise for the first time in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray.

===Novel===
In 1979, before the end of the anime, Yoshiyuki Tomino himself created the first novelizations of the original &quot;Gundam&quot; anime series. The novels, issued as a series of three books, allowed him to depict his story in a more sophisticated, adult, and detailed fashion. Along with this adaptation came several major changes to the story. For example, Amuro is already a member of the Federation military at the time of the initial Zeon attack on Side 7, and the main characters in the Federation serve on the &quot;White Base&quot;-class ships &quot;Pegasus&quot; and &quot;Pegasus II&quot; rather than the &quot;Pegasus&quot;-class &quot;White Base&quot;. Additionally, the war continues well into the year UC 0080 in the novels, whereas it concludes at the beginning of that year in the anime series. In the novel Amuro Ray is killed in the final attack against the Zeonic stronghold of A Baoa Qu when his RX-78-3 is pierced through the torso by a Rick Dom&#x27;s beam bazooka. This occurs as Char&#x27;s unit attempts to warn him about Gihren&#x27;s intention to destroy the fortress and take the Federation&#x27;s offensive fleet along with it. Char and the crew of &quot;Pegasus II&quot; (&quot;White Base&quot;), along with handpicked men under Kycilia Zabi&#x27;s command, make a deep penetrating attack against the Side 3 and together kill Gihren Zabi, after which Kycilia is killed by Char. Tomino later lamented that had he known that the anime&#x27;s ending would be different and that another series would be made, he would not have killed off Amuro in the novels.

The three novels were translated into English by Frederik Schodt and published by Del Rey Books in September 1990. At the time, there were no officially recognized romanizations of character and mecha names, and a variety of different spellings were being used in the English-language fan community. In the original three novels, therefore, Mr. Schodt wrote the name &quot;Char&quot; as &quot;Sha.&quot; &quot;Sha&quot; is a transliteration of the Japanese pronunciation, although Mr. Tomino later publicly confirmed at Anime Expo New York 2002 that the name was originally based on the French name Charles Aznavour, a popular French-language singer. (The 2004 edition of the English translation revealed that Schodt felt that the &quot;Char&quot; rendering &quot;seemed too close&quot; to Aznavour&#x27;s name.) He also rendered &quot;Zaku&quot; as &quot;Zak,&quot; and (after consulting with Tomino) &quot;Jion&quot; as &quot;Zeon,&quot; instead of &quot;Zion,&quot; which was in use in some circles. Some North American fans, already attached to particular spellings, took great umbrage at Schodt&#x27;s renditions, forgetting that in the original Japanese most character and mecha names are written in &quot;katakana&quot;, and that there were, therefore, no &quot;official spellings.&quot; Many years later, when the &quot;Gundam&quot; series was finally licensed in North America, the rights holders came up with a unified list of &quot;official spellings&quot; for English-language material, and some of these spellings include Schodt&#x27;s renditions, as well as the renditions to which certain North American fans were attached.

In 2004, Frederik Schodt revised his original translation of the books, which had been out of print for nearly a decade. What had been a three volume set in the 1990 Del Rey edition was re-released by Stone Bridge Press as one single volume of 476 pages (with a vastly improved cover design), titled &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Awakening, Escalation, Confrontation&quot;. Since the rights holders in Japan by this time had created a unified (although still evolving) list of romanized character and mecha names, Schodt was able to use it, and Amuro&#x27;s rival in the novel thus became &quot;Char&quot; and not &quot;Sha&quot;; the popular Zeon Mobile Suit, similarly, became &quot;Zaku,&quot; and not &quot;Zak&quot;.

===Films===
Following the success of the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; TV series, in 1981 Tomino reworked the footage into three separate compilation films. The first two films, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam I&quot; (also known as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam The Movie&quot;) and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow&quot;, were released in 1981. The third film, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam III: Encounters in Space&quot;, was released in 1982.

Each of the three films is largely composed of old footage from the TV series, however Tomino felt that some things could be changed for the better. Tomino removed several aspects of the show which he felt were still too super robot-esque for the real robot series he intended &quot;Gundam&quot; to be, such as the Gundam Hammer weapon. The G-Armor upgrade parts were also completely removed and replaced in the narrative by the more realistic Core Booster support fighters, and Hayato receives a RX-77 Guncannon at Jaburo to replace the disadvantaged RX-75 Guntank. The third film also includes a substantial amount of new footage expanding on the battles of Solomon and A Baoa Qu.

The first &quot;Gundam&quot; film, upon release on 22 February 1981, drew a large crowd of 15,000 people at its premiere, leading to concerns from police and media that it could lead to social unrest from a riotous crowd. The event is considered a turning point in the history of anime, referred to as &quot;the day that anime changed&quot; according to &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; newspaper. The first film grossed , and &quot;Gundam II&quot; grossed . &quot;Encounters in Space&quot; was 1982&#x27;s fourth highest-grossing Japanese film, with a distribution income of and a total box office gross of . Collectively, the trilogy grossed at the Japanese box office.

In 1998, the three compilation films were first released directly to VHS subtitled into English as part of Bandai&#x27;s AnimeVillage releases, which makes them among the first &quot;Gundam&quot; works released in English. A year later, Bandai released an English dub of three compilation films in 1999. Featuring the voice of Michael Lindsay as Amuro Ray, and Steve Blum as Char Aznable. Due to the dub mispronouncing the word Gundam as &quot;Gun-dam&quot;, and the Principality of Zeon being called the &quot;Duchy of Zeon&quot;, Sunrise prevented it from being re-released after its debut on VHS. The films were released again in North America on May 7, 2002, in DVD format, available separately or in a boxed set. These are also available only with re-done Japanese audio with English subtitles, the DVDs identical to the 20th anniversary release of the film compilation in Japan. The original Japanese voice cast members rerecorded their lines with the exception of those who were deceased. The 20th anniversary release was digitally remastered and many of the sound effects were replaced, most notably the futuristic gun sounds being replaced by louder machine gun sound effects. Also, the music soundtrack, while not remixed was rearranged and in some cases removed from some scenes. The vocal songs are rearranged also, especially in the closing credits of the second and third films.

Bandai Visual has announced the re-release of the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; films on DVD from new HD masters and with the original, theatrical, mono audio mix. This boxed set was released in Japan on December 21, 2007. On May 18, 2010, Bandai Entertainment re-released the 20th anniversary version of the trilogy under their Anime Legends label. As with the TV series, the films were re-released in North America under Sunrise themselves with distribution from Right Stuf Inc.

The trilogy of films were distributed on DVD in the United Kingdom by Beez Entertainment in 2005 in Japanese and with a selection of subtitle tracks including English. Anime Ltd. has since acquired the UK license and has released a limited edition Blu-ray box set of the film trilogy (limited to 500 units) as an exclusive, sold only on their AllTheAnime.com store. It was released on March 27, 2017, in Japanese with English subtitles only.

An animated film adaptation based on the &quot;Cucuruz Doan&#x27;s Island&quot; episode titled was released on June 3, 2022.

===Manga===
There have been three manga series based on &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. One was written by Yū Okazaki between 1979 and 1980 and compiled into two volumes. Another is &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 0079&quot; by Kazuhisa Kondo. It was published in &quot;Dengeki Comics&quot; from 1993 to 2005 in a total of twelve &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. Viz Media published its first nine volumes in English between 2000 and 2003. The third manga is &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin&quot; by anime character designer Yoshikazu Yasuhiko. It was published from June 2001 to June 2011 in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Gundam Ace&quot; magazine and collected in a total of 23 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. The series was first released in English by Viz Media but was dropped before it was completed; it was then released by Vertical from March 2013 to December 2015.

Besides adaptations, there is a popular parody yonkoma manga titled &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam-san&quot;, which was written and drawn by Hideki Ohwada and serialized in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Gundam Ace&quot; magazine since 2001. This manga was adapted into an anime in 2014. Ohwada also created a spinoff manga, , which follows Yoshiyuki Tomino and the Sunrise staff as they work to make the television series and the compilation films. This series was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Gundam Ace&quot; magazine from 2009 to 2011 and compiled in the &quot;Gundam-san&quot; tankōbon starting in Volume 5. Kadokawa released two tankōbon volumes collecting &quot;Gundam Sousei&quot; chapters as . Denpa published &quot;The Men Who Created Gundam&quot; in English in June 2022 as an omnibus volume.

A one-shot manga written and illustrated by Junji Oono, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan’s Island: Doan and Rolland&quot;, was published on June 24, 2022 in the appendix to the August issue of &quot;Gundam Ace&quot;. It serves as a prequel to the &quot;Cucuruz Doan&#x27;s Island&quot; episode of the series.

A continuation of the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 0079&quot; manga, titled &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 Episode Luna II&quot;, began serialization in &quot;Gundam Ace&quot; on November 26, 2022.

==Reception, influence and legacy==

&quot;Gundam&quot; was not popular when it first aired, and in fact came close to being cancelled. The series was originally set to run for 52 episodes but was cut down to 39 by the show&#x27;s sponsors, which included Clover (the original toymakers for the series). However, the staff was able to negotiate a one-month extension to end the series with 43 episodes. When Bandai bought the copyrights to build plastic models for the show&#x27;s mecha, which was a relatively new market compared to the old Chogokin series Clover was making, things changed completely. With the introduction of their line of Gundam models, the popularity of the show began to soar. The models sold very well, the show began to do very well in reruns and its theatrical compilation was a huge success. Audiences were expecting another Super Robot TV show, and instead found &quot;Gundam&quot;, the first work of anime in an entirely new genre: the Real Robot genre. The Anime ranked #2 on &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Anime&quot; Magazine on their &quot;Top 50 Anime released in North America&quot;, and is regarded as changing the concept of Japanese robot anime and the turning point of history in Japan.

Despite being released in 1979, the original &quot;Gundam&quot; series is still remembered and recognized within the anime fan community. The series revolutionized mecha anime, introducing the new Real Robot genre, and over the years became synonymous with the entire genre for many. As a result, for example, parodies of mecha genre commonly feature homages to &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, thanks to its immediate recognizability.

The series was the first winner of the &quot;Animage&quot; Anime Grand Prix prize, in 1979 and the first half of 1980. In the top 100 anime from &quot;Animage&quot;, &quot;Gundam&quot; was twenty-fourth. The magazine &quot;Wizard&quot; listed the series as the second best anime of all time. By the end of 2007, each episode of the original TV series averaged a sales figure of 80,928 copies, including all of the different formats it was published in (VHS, LD, DVD, etc.). The first DVD box set sold over 100,000 copies in the first month of release, from December 21, 2007 to January 21, 2008. As part of the 30th Anniversary of the Gundam series, the company officially announced a project on March 11, 2009 called &quot;Real-G&quot;, a plan to build a 1:1 real size scale Gundam in Japan. It was completed in July 2009 and displayed in a Tokyo park then taken down later. The 18-meter tall statue was reconstructed in Shizuoka Prefecture and was taken down in March 2011. In August 2011 it was dismantled only to reopen in Odaiba, Tokyo on April 19, 2012. It stood Odaiba along with a gift shop called &quot;Gundam Front Tokyo&quot; until it was dismantled in March 2016.

Most of the critical response to the series has been due to the setting and characters. John Oppliger observes that the characters of Amuro Ray, to whom the young Japanese of that time could easily relate, and Char Aznable, who was &quot;simply [...] fascinating&quot;, made a major contribution to the series&#x27; popularity. He also concludes that &quot;in many respects First Gundam stands for the nostalgic identifying values of everything that anime itself represents&quot;. The series has been praised by Anime News Network for the way it portrays war with Amuro facing traumatic moments as a result of killing enemy soldiers in his becoming of a soldier. The series is also notable for having humans from a different race as antagonists rather than evil creatures. However, the animation has been noted to have notoriously aged when compared with series seen in the 2000s.

Mecha anime creator Shoji Kawamori attended Keio University in the same years as &quot;Macross&quot; screenwriter Hiroshi Ōnogi and character designer Haruhiko Mikimoto, where they had a &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; fan club called &quot;Gunsight One&quot;, a name they would use years later as the call sign of the bridge of the SDF-1 spaceship from their first &quot;Macross&quot; anime television series. In fact, &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; mecha anime series was inspired by Gundam in several aspects during its early development. Guillermo del Toro has cited the series as an influence on &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;.

American musician Richie Kotzen, former guitarist from Poison and Mr. Big, released an album called &quot;Ai Senshi ZxR&quot; in 2006 in Japan. The album consisted of covered music from the Gundam series and original songs. American musician Andrew W.K. also released an album called &quot;Gundam Rock&quot; on September 9, 2009, in Japan. The album consists of covered music from the Gundam series to celebrate its 30th anniversary.

===Background research===
The background research of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; is well praised in its field. The positions in which the colonies (sides) are located in orbit are called Lagrangian points, and are real world solutions to the three-body problem. The colonies (sides) are based on the O&#x27;Neill cylinder design for space habitats. The Gundam franchise was a major contributing factor to the fame of the O&#x27;Neil cylinder in Japan.

===Rides===
&quot;Gundam the Ride: A Baoa Qu&quot; was an amusement park attraction at the Fuji-Q Highland Amusement Park located in Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi, Japan. It was a dark ride for the park. Gundam the Ride, which opened to the public on July 20, 2000, was based on &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. Set during the final chaotic Battle of A Baoa Qu, Gundam the Ride places its riders in an Escape Launch Shuttle about to leave the battleship &quot;Suruga&quot;.

The animation of Gundam the Ride used mostly computer graphics, however, all human characters were hand-drawn cel animation, similar to the style current &quot;Gundam&quot; video games are done in. All of the character designs for Gundam the Ride were done by Haruhiko Mikimoto. The ride&#x27;s characters make a cameo appearance in the video game &quot;Encounters in Space&quot; while the player (playing as Amuro Ray in his Gundam) is making his way through the &quot;Dolos&quot;.

The ride closed on January 8, 2007, and replaced with &quot;Gundam Crisis Attraction&quot; The main feature of this attraction is a full size 1:1 Gundam model, lying flat inside the venue. Instead of sitting in a movable cockpit and watching a CG movie, it requires participants to carry handheld devices throughout the attraction to find certain pieces of information, similar to a scavenger hunt, in order to activate the Gundam. The interior of the attraction is a mock-up of a Federation ship, and employees remain in-character inside of the ride.

<doc id="20119" wikidata="Q33203" url="?curid=20119" title="Methodism">
<text>Methodism, also called the Methodist movement, is a Protestant Christian tradition whose origins, doctrine and practice derive from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John&#x27;s brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement. They were named &quot;Methodists&quot; for &quot;the methodical way in which they carried out their Christian faith&quot;. Methodism originated as a revival movement within Anglicanism with roots in the Church of England in the 18th century and became a separate denomination after Wesley&#x27;s death. The movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States and beyond because of vigorous missionary work, and today has about 80 million adherents worldwide.

Wesleyan theology, which is upheld by the Methodist denominations, focuses on sanctification and the transforming effect of faith on the character of a Christian. Distinguishing doctrines include the new birth, assurance, imparted righteousness, and obedience to God manifested in performing works of piety. John Wesley held that entire sanctification was &quot;the grand depositum&quot;, or foundational doctrine, of the Methodist faith, and its propagation was the reason God brought Methodists into existence. Scripture is considered the primary authority, but Methodists also look to Christian tradition, including the historic creeds. Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for all of humanity and that salvation is achievable for all. This is the Arminian doctrine, as opposed to the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people. However, Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position.

The movement has a wide variety of forms of worship, ranging from high church to low church in liturgical usage, in addition to tent revivals and camp meetings held at certain times of the year. Denominations that descend from the British Methodist tradition are generally less ritualistic, while worship in American Methodism varies depending on the Methodist denomination and congregation. Methodist worship distinctiveness includes the observance of the quarterly lovefeast, the watchnight service on New Year&#x27;s Eve, as well as altar calls in which people are invited to experience the new birth and entire sanctification. Its emphasis on growing in grace after the new birth (and after being entirely sanctified) led to the creation of class meetings for encouragement in the Christian life. Methodism is known for its rich musical tradition, and Charles Wesley was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of Methodism.

In addition to evangelism, Methodism is known for its charity, as well as support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through works of mercy that &quot;flow from the love of God and neighbor&quot; evidenced in the entirely sanctified believer. These ideals, the Social Gospel, are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals, orphanages, soup kitchens, and schools to follow Christ&#x27;s command to spread the gospel and serve all people. Methodists are historically known for their adherence to the doctrine of nonconformity to the world, reflected by their traditional standards of a commitment to sobriety, prohibition of gambling, regular attendance at class meetings, and weekly observance of the Friday fast.

Early Methodists were drawn from all levels of society, including the aristocracy, but the Methodist preachers took the message to labourers and criminals who tended to be left outside organized religion at that time. In Britain, the Methodist Church had a major effect in the early decades of the developing working class (1760–1820). In the United States, it became the religion of many slaves, who later formed black churches in the Methodist tradition.
==Origins==


The Methodist revival began in England with a group of men, including John Wesley (1703–1791) and his younger brother Charles (1707–1788), as a movement within the Church of England in the 18th century. The Wesley brothers founded the &quot;Holy Club&quot; at the University of Oxford, where John was a fellow and later a lecturer at Lincoln College. The club met weekly and they systematically set about living a holy life. They were accustomed to receiving Communion every week, fasting regularly, abstaining from most forms of amusement and luxury, and frequently visiting the sick and the poor and prisoners. The fellowship were branded as &quot;Methodist&quot; by their fellow students because of the way they used &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;method&quot; to go about their religious affairs. John, who was leader of the club, took the attempted mockery and turned it into a title of honour.

In 1735, at the invitation of the founder of the Georgia Colony, General James Oglethorpe, both John and Charles Wesley set out for America to be ministers to the colonists and missionaries to the Native Americans. Unsuccessful in their work, the brothers returned to England conscious of their lack of genuine Christian faith. They looked for help from Peter Boehler and other members of the Moravian Church. At a Moravian service in Aldersgate on 24 May 1738, John experienced what has come to be called his evangelical conversion, when he felt his &quot;heart strangely warmed&quot;. He records in his journal: &quot;I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.&quot; Charles had reported a similar experience a few days previously. Considering this a pivotal moment, Daniel L. Burnett writes: &quot;The significance of [John] Wesley&#x27;s Aldersgate Experience is monumental ... Without it the names of Wesley and Methodism would likely be nothing more than obscure footnotes in the pages of church history.&quot;

The Wesley brothers immediately began to preach salvation by faith to individuals and groups, in houses, in religious societies, and in the few churches which had not closed their doors to evangelical preachers. John Wesley came under the influence of the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609). Arminius had rejected the Calvinist teaching that God had pre-ordained an elect number of people to eternal bliss while others perished eternally. Conversely, George Whitefield (1714–1770), Howell Harris (1714–1773), and Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon (1707–1791) were notable for being Calvinistic Methodists.
Returning from his mission in Georgia, George Whitefield joined the Wesley brothers in what was rapidly becoming a national crusade. Whitefield, who had been a fellow student of the Wesleys and prominent member of the Holy Club at Oxford, became well known for his unorthodox, itinerant ministry, in which he was dedicated to open-air preachingreaching crowds of thousands. A key step in the development of John Wesley&#x27;s ministry was, like Whitefield, to preach in fields, collieries, and churchyards to those who did not regularly attend parish church services. Accordingly, many Methodist converts were those disconnected from the Church of England; Wesley remained a cleric of the Established Church and insisted that Methodists attend their local parish church as well as Methodist meetings because only an ordained minister could perform the sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion.

Faced with growing evangelistic and pastoral responsibilities, Wesley and Whitefield appointed lay preachers and leaders. Methodist preachers focused particularly on evangelising people who had been &quot;neglected&quot; by the established Church of England. Wesley and his assistant preachers organized the new converts into Methodist societies. These societies were divided into groups called &quot;classes&quot;intimate meetings where individuals were encouraged to confess their sins to one another and to build up each other. They also took part in love feasts which allowed for the sharing of testimony, a key feature of early Methodism. Growth in numbers and increasing hostility impressed upon the revival converts a deep sense of their corporate identity. Three teachings that Methodists saw as the foundation of Christian faith were:
# People are all, by nature, &quot;dead in sin&quot;.
# They are justified by faith alone.
# Faith produces inward and outward holiness.

Wesley&#x27;s organisational skills soon established him as the primary leader of the movement. Whitefield was a Calvinist, whereas Wesley was an outspoken opponent of the doctrine of predestination. Wesley argued (against Calvinist doctrine) that Christians could enjoy a second blessingentire sanctification (Christian perfection) in this life: loving God and their neighbours, meekness and lowliness of heart and abstaining from all appearance of evil. These differences put strains on the alliance between Whitefield and Wesley, with Wesley becoming hostile toward Whitefield in what had been previously close relations. Whitefield consistently begged Wesley not to let theological differences sever their friendship, and, in time, their friendship was restored, though this was seen by many of Whitefield&#x27;s followers to be a doctrinal compromise.

Many clergy in the established church feared that new doctrines promulgated by the Methodists, such as the necessity of a new birth for salvationthe first work of grace, of justification by faith and of the constant and sustained action of the Holy Spirit upon the believer&#x27;s soul, would produce ill effects upon weak minds. Theophilus Evans, an early critic of the movement, even wrote that it was &quot;the natural Tendency of their Behaviour, in Voice and Gesture and horrid Expressions, to make People mad&quot;. In one of his prints, William Hogarth likewise attacked Methodists as &quot;enthusiasts&quot; full of &quot;Credulity, Superstition, and Fanaticism&quot;. Other attacks against the Methodists were physically violentWesley was nearly murdered by a mob at Wednesbury in 1743. The Methodists responded vigorously to their critics and thrived despite the attacks against them.
Initially, the Methodists merely sought reform within the Church of England (Anglicanism), but the movement gradually departed from that Church. George Whitefield&#x27;s preference for extemporaneous prayer rather than the fixed forms of prayer in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, in addition to his insistence on the necessity of the new birth, set him at odds with Anglican clergy.

As Methodist societies multiplied, and elements of an ecclesiastical system were, one after another, adopted, the breach between John Wesley and the Church of England gradually widened. In 1784, Wesley responded to the shortage of priests in the American colonies due to the American Revolutionary War by ordaining preachers for America with the power to administer the sacraments. Wesley&#x27;s actions precipitated the split between American Methodists and the Church of England (which held that only bishops could ordain people to ministry).

With regard to the position of Methodism within Christendom, &quot;John Wesley once noted that what God had achieved in the development of Methodism was no mere human endeavor but the work of God. As such it would be preserved by God so long as history remained.&quot; Calling it &quot;the grand depositum&quot; of the Methodist faith, Wesley specifically taught that the propagation of the doctrine of entire sanctification was the reason that God raised up the Methodists in the world. In light of this, Methodists traditionally promote the motto &quot;Holiness unto the Lord&quot;.

The influence of Whitefield and Lady Huntingdon on the Church of England was a factor in the founding of the Free Church of England in 1844. At the time of Wesley&#x27;s death, there were over 500 Methodist preachers in British colonies and the United States. Total membership of the Methodist societies in Britain was recorded as 56,000 in 1791, rising to 360,000 in 1836 and 1,463,000 by the national census of 1851.

Early Methodism experienced a radical and spiritual phase that allowed women authority in church leadership. The role of the woman preacher emerged from the sense that the home should be a place of community care and should foster personal growth. Methodist women formed a community that cared for the vulnerable, extending the role of mothering beyond physical care. Women were encouraged to testify their faith. However, the centrality of women&#x27;s role sharply diminished after 1790 as Methodist churches became more structured and more male-dominated.

The Wesleyan Education Committee, which existed from 1838 to 1902, has documented the Methodist Church&#x27;s involvement in the education of children. At first, most effort was placed in creating Sunday Schools. Still, in 1836 the British Methodist Conference gave its blessing to the creation of &quot;Weekday schools&quot;.

Methodism spread throughout the British Empire and, mostly through Whitefield&#x27;s preaching during what historians call the First Great Awakening, in colonial America. However, after Whitefield&#x27;s death in 1770, American Methodism entered a more lasting Wesleyan and Arminian development phase. Revival services and camp meetings were used &quot;for spreading the Methodist message&quot;, with Francis Asbury stating that they were &quot;our harvest seasons&quot;. Henry Boehm reported that at a camp meeting in Dover in 1805, 1100 persons received the New Birth and 600 believers were entirely sanctified. Around the time of John Swanel Inskip&#x27;s leadership of the National Camp Meeting Association for the Promotion of Christian Holiness in the mid to latter 1800s, 80 percent of the membership of the North Georgia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South professed being entirely sanctified.

==Theology==

Many Methodist bodies, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the United Methodist Church, base their doctrinal standards on the Articles of Religion, John Wesley&#x27;s abridgment of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England that excised its Calvinist features. Some Methodist denominations also publish catechisms, which concisely summarise Christian doctrine. Methodists generally accept the Apostles&#x27; Creed and the Nicene Creed as declarations of shared Christian faith. Methodism affirms the traditional Christian belief in the triune Godhead (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) as well as the orthodox understanding of the person of Jesus Christ as God incarnate who is both fully divine and fully human. Methodism also emphasizes doctrines that indicate the power of the Holy Spirit to strengthen the faith of believers and to transform their personal lives.

Methodism is broadly evangelical in doctrine and is characterized by Wesleyan theology; John Wesley is studied by Methodists for his interpretation of church practice and doctrine. At its heart, the theology of John Wesley stressed the life of Christian holiness: to love God with all one&#x27;s heart, mind, soul and strength and to love one&#x27;s neighbour as oneself. One popular expression of Methodist doctrine is in the hymns of Charles Wesley. Since enthusiastic congregational singing was a part of the early evangelical movement, Wesleyan theology took root and spread through this channel. Martin V. Clarke, who documented the history of Methodist hymnody, states:

Theologically and doctrinally, the content of the hymns has traditionally been a primary vehicle for expressing Methodism&#x27;s emphasis on salvation for all, social holiness, and personal commitment, while particular hymns and the communal act of participating in hymn singing have been key elements in the spiritual lives of Methodists.

===Salvation===
Wesleyan Methodists identify with the Arminian conception of free will, as opposed to the theological determinism of absolute predestination. Methodism teaches that salvation is initiated when one chooses to respond to God, who draws the individual near to him (the Wesleyan doctrine of prevenient grace), thus teaching synergism. Methodists interpret Scripture as teaching that the saving work of Jesus Christ is for all people (unlimited atonement) but effective only to those who respond and believe, in accordance with the Reformation principles of &quot;sola gratia&quot; (grace alone) and &quot;sola fide&quot; (faith alone). John Wesley taught four key points fundamental to Methodism:
# A person is free not only to reject salvation but also to accept it by an act of free will.
# All people who are obedient to the gospel according to the measure of knowledge given them will be saved.
# The Holy Spirit assures a Christian that they are justified by faith in Jesus (assurance of faith).
# Christians in this life are capable of Christian perfection and are commanded by God to pursue it.

After the first work of grace (the new birth), Methodist soteriology emphasizes the importance of the pursuit of holiness in salvation, a concept best summarized in a quote by Methodist evangelist Phoebe Palmer who stated that &quot;justification would have ended with me had I refused to be holy.&quot; Thus, for Methodists, &quot;true faith ... cannot subsist without works.&quot; Methodism, inclusive of the holiness movement, thus teaches that &quot;justification [is made] conditional on obedience and progress in sanctification&quot;, emphasizing &quot;a deep reliance upon Christ not only in coming to faith, but in remaining in the faith.&quot; John Wesley taught that the keeping of the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments, as well as engaging in the works of piety and the works of mercy, were &quot;indispensable for our sanctification&quot;. In its categorization of sin, Methodist doctrine distinguishes between (1) &quot;sin, properly so called&quot; and (2) &quot;involuntary transgression of a divine law, known or unknown&quot;; the former category includes voluntary transgression against God, while the second category includes infirmities (such as &quot;immaturity, ignorance, physical handicaps, forgetfulness, lack of discernment, and poor communication skills&quot;).

This is reflected in the Articles of Religion of the Free Methodist Church (emphasis added in italics), which uses the wording of John Wesley:
Methodists also believe in the second work of graceChristian perfection, also known as entire sanctification, which removes original sin, makes the believer holy and empowers him/her with power to wholly serve God. John Wesley explained, &quot;entire sanctification, or Christian perfection, is neither more nor less than pure love; love expelling sin, and governing both the heart and life of a child of God. The Refiner&#x27;s fire purges out all that is contrary to love.&quot;

Methodist churches teach that apostasy can occur through a loss of faith or through sinning. If a person backslides but later decides to return to God, he or she must repent for sins and be entirely sanctified again (the Arminian doctrine of conditional security).
===Sacraments===
Methodists hold that sacraments are sacred acts of divine institution. Methodism has inherited its liturgy from Anglicanism, although Wesleyan theology tends to have a stronger &quot;sacramental emphasis&quot; than that held by evangelical Anglicans.

In common with most Protestants, Methodists recognize two sacraments as being instituted by Christ: Baptism and Holy Communion (also called the Lord&#x27;s Supper). Most Methodist churches practice infant baptism, in anticipation of a response to be made later (confirmation), as well as baptism of believing adults. The &quot;Catechism for the Use of the People Called Methodists&quot; states that, &quot;[in Holy Communion] Jesus Christ is present with his worshipping people and gives himself to them as their Lord and Saviour.&quot; In the United Methodist Church, the explanation of how Christ&#x27;s presence is made manifest in the elements (bread and wine) is described as a &quot;Holy Mystery&quot;.

Methodist churches generally recognize sacraments to be a means of grace. John Wesley held that God also imparted grace by other established means such as public and private prayer, Scripture reading, study and preaching, public worship, and fasting; these constitute the works of piety. Wesley considered means of grace to be &quot;outward signs, words, or actions ... to be the ordinary channels whereby [God] might convey to men, preventing [i.e., preparing], justifying or sanctifying grace.&quot; Specifically Methodist means, such as the class meetings, provided his chief examples for these prudential means of grace.

===Sources of teaching===

American Methodist theologian Albert Outler, in assessing John Wesley&#x27;s own practices of theological reflection, proposes a methodology termed the &quot;Wesleyan Quadrilateral&quot;. Wesley&#x27;s Quadrilateral is referred to in Methodism as &quot;our theological guidelines&quot; and is taught to its ministers (clergy) in seminary as the primary approach to interpreting Scripture and gaining guidance for moral questions and dilemmas faced in daily living.

Traditionally, Methodists declare the Bible (Old and New Testaments) to be the only divinely inspired Scripture and the primary source of authority for Christians. The historic Methodist understanding of Scripture is based on the superstructure of Wesleyan covenant theology. Methodists also make use of tradition, drawing primarily from the teachings of the Church Fathers, as a secondary source of authority. Tradition may serve as a lens through which Scripture is interpreted. Theological discourse for Methodists almost always makes use of Scripture read inside the wider theological tradition of Christianity.

John Wesley contended that a part of the theological method would involve experiential faith. In other words, truth would be vivified in personal experience of Christians (overall, not individually), if it were really truth. And every doctrine must be able to be defended rationally. He did not divorce faith from reason. By reason, one asks questions of faith and seeks to understand God&#x27;s action and will. Tradition, experience and reason, however, were subject always to Scripture, Wesley argued, because only there is the Word of God revealed &quot;so far as it is necessary for our salvation.&quot;

==Prayer, worship, and liturgy==

With respect to public worship, Methodism was endowed by the Wesley brothers with worship characterised by a twofold practice: the ritual liturgy of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; on the one hand and the non-ritualistic preaching service on the other. This twofold practice became distinctive of Methodism because worship in the Church of England was based, by law, solely on the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and worship in the Nonconformist churches was almost exclusively that of &quot;services of the word&quot;, i.e. preaching services, with Holy Communion being observed infrequently. John Wesley&#x27;s influence meant that, in Methodism, the two practices were combined, a situation which remains characteristic of the tradition. Methodism has heavily emphasized &quot;offerings of extempore and spontaneous prayer&quot;. To this end, Methodist revival services and camp meetings have been characterized by groaning and shouting, as people sought the fullness of salvation that Methodists taught to be embodied by the experience of entire sanctification. To outsiders, Wesleyans were labeled as &quot;Shouting Methodists&quot; due to their free expression during worship.

Historically, Methodist churches have devoutly observed the Lord&#x27;s Day (Sunday) with a morning service of worship, along with an evening service of worship (with the evening service being aimed at seekers and focusing on &quot;singing, prayer, and preaching&quot;); the holding of a midweek prayer meeting on Wednesday evenings has been customary. 18th-century Methodist church services were characterized by the following pattern: &quot;preliminaries (e.g., singing, prayers, testimonies), to a &#x27;message,&#x27; followed by an invitation to commitment&quot;, the latter of which took the form altar call—a practice that a remains &quot;a vital part&quot; of worship. A number of Methodist congregations devote a portion of their Sunday evening service and mid-week Wednesday evening prayer meeting to having congregants share their prayer requests, in addition to hearing personal testimonies about their faith and experiences in living the Christian life. After listening to various members of the congregation voice their prayer requests, congregants may kneel for intercessory prayer. The Lovefeast, traditionally practiced quarterly, was another practice that characterized early Methodism as John Wesley taught that it was an apostolic ordinance. Worship, hymnology, devotional and liturgical practices in Methodism were also influenced by Pietistic Lutheranism and, in turn, Methodist worship became influential in the Holiness movement.

Early Methodism was known for its &quot;almost monastic rigors, its living by rule, [and] its canonical hours of prayer&quot;. It inherited from its Anglican patrimony the practice of reciting the Daily Office, which Methodist Christians were expected to pray. The first prayer book of Methodism, &quot;The Sunday Service of the Methodists with other occasional Services&quot; thus included the canonical hours of both Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer; these services were observed everyday in early Christianity, though on the Lord&#x27;s Day, worship included the Eucharist. Later Methodist liturgical books, such as the &quot;Methodist Worship Book&quot; (1999) provide for Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer to be prayed daily; the United Methodist Church encourages its communicants to pray the canonical hours as &quot;one of the essential practices&quot; of being a disciple of Jesus. Some Methodist religious orders publish the Daily Office to be used for that community, for example, &quot;The Book of Offices and Services of The Order of Saint Luke&quot; contains the canonical hours to be prayed traditionally at seven fixed prayer times: Lauds (6 am), Terce (9 am), Sext (12 pm), None (3 pm), Vespers (6 pm), Compline (9 pm) and Vigil (12 am). Some Methodist congregations offer daily Morning Prayer.

In America, the United Methodist Church and Free Methodist Church, as well as the Primitive Methodist Church and Wesleyan Methodist Church, have a wide variety of forms of worship, ranging from high church to low church in liturgical usage. When the Methodists in America were separated from the Church of England because of the American Revolution, John Wesley provided a revised version of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; called &quot;The Sunday Service of the Methodists; With Other Occasional Services&quot; (1784). Today, the primary liturgical books of the United Methodist Church are &quot;The United Methodist Hymnal&quot; and &quot;The United Methodist Book of Worship&quot; (1992). Congregations employ its liturgy and rituals as optional resources, but their use is not mandatory. These books contain the liturgies of the church that are generally derived from Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Service&quot; and from the 20th-century liturgical renewal movement.

The British Methodist Church is less ordered, or less liturgical, in worship. It makes use of the &quot;Methodist Worship Book&quot; (similar to the Church of England&#x27;s &quot;Common Worship&quot;), containing set services and rubrics for the celebration of other rites, such as marriage. The &quot;Worship Book&quot; is also ultimately derived from Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Service&quot;.

A unique feature of American Methodism has been the observance of the season of Kingdomtide, encompassing the last 13 weeks before Advent, thus dividing the long season after Pentecost into two segments. During Kingdomtide, Methodist liturgy has traditionally emphasized charitable work and alleviating the suffering of the poor.

A second distinctive liturgical feature of Methodism is the use of Covenant Services. Although practice varies between national churches, most Methodist churches annually follow the call of John Wesley for a renewal of their covenant with God. It is common for each congregation to use the Covenant Renewal liturgy during the watchnight service in the night of New Year&#x27;s Eve, though in Britain, these are often on the first Sunday of the year. Wesley&#x27;s covenant prayer is still used, with minor modification, in the order of service:


As John Wesley advocated outdoor evangelism, revival services are a traditional worship practice of Methodism that are often held in churches, as well as at camp meetings, brush arbor revivals, and tent revivals.

==Membership==
Traditionally, Methodist connexions descending from the tradition of the Methodist Episcopal Church have a probationary period of six months before an individual is admitted into church membership as a full member of a congregation. Given the wide attendance at Methodist revival meetings, many people started to attend Methodist services of worship regularly, though they had not yet committed to membership. When they made that commitment, becoming a probationer was the first step and during this period, probationers &quot;receive additional instruction and provide evidence of the seriousness of their faith and willingness to abide by church discipline before being accepted into full membership.&quot; In addition to this, to be a probationary member of a Methodist congregation, a person traditionally requires an &quot;earnest desire to be saved from [one&#x27;s] sins&quot;. In the historic Methodist system, probationers were eligible to become members of class meetings, where they could be further discipled in their faith.

Catechisms such as &quot;The Probationer&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, authored by minister Stephen O. Garrison, have been used by probationers to learn the Methodist faith. After six months, probationers were examined before the Leaders and Stewards&#x27; Meeting (which consisted of Class Leaders and Stewards) where they were to provide &quot;satisfactory assurance both of the correctness of his faith and of his willingness to observe and keep the rules of the church.&quot; If probationers were able to do this, they were admitted as full members of the congregation by the pastor.

Full members of a Methodist congregation &quot;were obligated to attend worship services on a regular basis&quot; and &quot;were to abide by certain moral precepts, especially as they related to substance use, gambling, divorce, and immoral pastimes.&quot; This practice continues in certain Methodist connexions, such as the Lumber River Conference of the Holiness Methodist Church, in which probationers must be examined by the pastor, class leader, and board for full membership, in addition to being baptized. The same structure is found in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, which teaches:

The pastor and class leader are to ensure &quot;that all persons on probation be instructed in the Rules and Doctrines of The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church before they are admitted to Full Membership&quot; and that &quot;probationers are expected to conform to the rules and usages of the Church, and to show evidence of their desire for fellowship in the Church&quot;. After the six-month probation period, &quot;A probationer may be admitted to full membership, provided he/she has served out his/her probation, has been baptized, recommended at the Leaders&#x27; Meeting, and, if none has been held according to law, recommended by the Leader, and, on examination by the Pastor before the Church as required in ¶600 has given satisfactory assurance both of the correctness of his/her faith, and of his/her willingness to observe and keep the rules of our Church.&quot; The Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection admits to associate membership, by vote of the congregation, those who give affirmation to two questions: &quot;1) Does the Lord now forgive your sins? 2) Will you acquaint yourself with the discipline of our connection and earnestly endeavor to govern your life by its rules as God shall give you understanding?&quot; Probationers who wish to become full members are examined by the advisory board before being received as such through four vows (on the new birth, entire sanctification, outward holiness, and assent to the Articles of Religion) and a covenant. In the United Methodist Church, the process of becoming a professing member of a congregation is done through the taking membership vows (normatively in the rite of confirmation) after a period of instruction and receiving the sacrament of baptism. It is the practice of certain Methodist connexions that when people become members of a congregation, they are offered the Right Hand of Fellowship. Methodists traditionally celebrate the Covenant Renewal Service as the watchnight service annually on New Year&#x27;s Eve, in which members renew their covenant with God and the Church.

==Lifestyle==

Early Methodists wore plain dress, with Methodist clergy condemning &quot;high headdresses, ruffles, laces, gold, and &#x27;costly apparel&#x27; in general&quot;. John Wesley recommended that Methodists annually read his thoughts &quot;On Dress&quot;; in that sermon, Wesley expressed his desire for Methodists: &quot;Let me see, before I die, a Methodist congregation, full as plain dressed as a Quaker congregation.&quot; The 1858 Discipline of the Wesleyan Methodist Connection thus stated that &quot;we would ... enjoin on all who fear God plain dress.&quot; Peter Cartwright, a Methodist revivalist, stated that in addition to wearing plain dress, the early Methodists distinguished themselves from other members of society by fasting once a week, abstaining from alcohol (teetotalism), and devoutly observing the Sabbath. Methodist circuit riders were known for practicing the spiritual discipline of mortifying the flesh as they &quot;arose well before dawn for solitary prayer; they remained on their knees without food or drink or physical comforts sometimes for hours on end.&quot; The early Methodists did not participate in, and condemned, &quot;worldly habits&quot; including &quot;playing cards, racing horses, gambling, attending the theater, dancing (both in frolics and balls), and cockfighting.&quot;

In Methodism, fasting is considered one of the works of piety. The Directions Given to Band Societies (25 December 1744) by John Wesley mandate fasting and abstinence from meat on all Fridays of the year (in remembrance of the crucifixion of Jesus). Wesley himself also fasted before receiving Holy Communion &quot;for the purpose of focusing his attention on God,&quot; and asked other Methodists to do the same.

Over time, many of these practices were relaxed in mainline Methodism, although practices such as teetotalism and fasting are still encouraged, in addition to the current prohibition of gambling. Denominations of the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Methodist Church Conference, continue to reflect the spirit of the historic Methodist practice of wearing plain dress, with members abstaining from the &quot;wearing of apparel which does not modestly and properly clothe the person&quot; and &quot;refraining from the wearing of jewelry&quot; and &quot;superfluous ornaments (including the wedding ring)&quot;. The Fellowship of Independent Methodist Churches, which continues to observe the ordinance of women&#x27;s headcovering, stipulates &quot;renouncing all vain pomp and glory&quot; and &quot;adorning oneself with modest attire.&quot; The General Rules of the Methodist Church in America, which are among the doctrinal standards of many Methodist Churches, promote first-day Sabbatarianism as they require &quot;attending upon all the ordinances of God&quot; including &quot;the public worship of God&quot; and prohibit &quot;profaning the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work therein or by buying or selling.&quot;

==Contemporary Methodist denominations==
Methodism is a worldwide movement and Methodist churches are present on all populated continents. Although Methodism is declining in Great Britain and North America, it is growing in other placesat a rapid pace in, for example, South Korea. There is no single Methodist Church with universal juridical authority; Methodists belong to multiple independent denominations or &quot;connexions&quot;. The great majority of Methodists are members of denominations which are part of the World Methodist Council, an international association of 80 Methodist, Wesleyan, and related uniting denominations, representing about 80 million people.

===Europe===

Methodism is prevalent in the English-speaking world but it is also organized in mainland Europe, largely due to missionary activity of British and American Methodists. British missionaries were primarily responsible for establishing Methodism across Ireland and Italy. Today the United Methodist Church (UMC)a large denomination based in the United Stateshas a presence in Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine. Collectively the European and Eurasian regions of the UMC constitute a little over 100,000 Methodists (). Other smaller Methodist denominations exist in Europe.

====Great Britain====
The original body founded as a result of Wesley&#x27;s work came to be known as the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Schisms within the original church, and independent revivals, led to the formation of a number of separate denominations calling themselves &quot;Methodist&quot;. The largest of these were the Primitive Methodists, deriving from a revival at Mow Cop in Staffordshire, the Bible Christians, and the Methodist New Connexion. The original church adopted the name &quot;Wesleyan Methodist&quot; to distinguish it from these bodies. In 1907, a union of smaller groups with the Methodist New Connexion and Bible Christian Church brought about the United Methodist Church; then the three major streams of British Methodism united in 1932 to form the present Methodist Church of Great Britain. The fourth-largest denomination in the country, the Methodist Church of Great Britain has about 202,000 members in 4,650 congregations.
Early Methodism was particularly prominent in Devon and Cornwall, which were key centers of activity by the Bible Christian faction of Methodists. The Bible Christians produced many preachers, and sent many missionaries to Australia. Methodism also grew rapidly in the old mill towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire, where the preachers stressed that the working classes were equal to the upper classes in the eyes of God. In Wales, three elements separately welcomed Methodism: Welsh-speaking, English-speaking, and Calvinistic.

British Methodists, in particular the Primitive Methodists, took a leading role in the temperance movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Methodists saw alcoholic beverages, and alcoholism, as the root of many social ills and tried to persuade people to abstain from these. Temperance appealed strongly to the Methodist doctrines of sanctification and perfection. To this day, alcohol remains banned in Methodist premises, however this restriction no longer applies to domestic occasions in private homes (i.e. the minister may have a drink at home in the manse). The choice to consume alcohol is now a personal decision for any member.
British Methodism does not have bishops; however, it has always been characterised by a strong central organisation, the Connexion, which holds an annual Conference (the church retains the 18th-century spelling &quot;connexion&quot; for many purposes). The Connexion is divided into Districts in the charge of the chairperson (who may be male or female). Methodist districts often correspond approximately, in geographical terms, to countiesas do Church of England dioceses. The districts are divided into circuits governed by the Circuit Meeting and led and administrated principally by a superintendent minister. Ministers are appointed to Circuits rather than to individual churches, although some large inner-city churches, known as &quot;central halls&quot;, are designated as circuits in themselvesof these Westminster Central Hall, opposite Westminster Abbey in central London, is the best known. Most circuits have fewer ministers than churches, and the majority of services are led by lay local preachers, or by supernumerary ministers (ministers who have retired, called supernumerary because they are not counted for official purposes in the numbers of ministers for the circuit in which they are listed). The superintendent and other ministers are assisted in the leadership and administration of the Circuit by circuit stewards - laypeople with particular skills who, who with the ministers, collectively form what is normally known as the Circuit Leadership Team.

The Methodist Council also helps to run a number of schools, including two public schools in East Anglia: Culford School and the Leys School. The council promotes an all round education with a strong Christian ethos.

Other Methodist denominations in Britain include: the Free Methodist Church, the Fellowship of Independent Methodist Churches, the Church of the Nazarene, and The Salvation Army, all of which are Methodist churches aligned with the holiness movement, as well as the Wesleyan Reform Union, an early secession from the Wesleyan Methodist Church, and the Independent Methodist Connexion.

====Ireland====

John Wesley visited Ireland on at least twenty-four occasions and established classes and societies. The Methodist Church in Ireland () today operates across both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on an all-Ireland basis. , there were around 50,000 Methodists across Ireland. In 2013, the biggest concentration – 13,171 – was in Belfast, with 2,614 in Dublin. , it is the fourth-largest denomination in Northern Ireland, with Methodists accounting for 2.3% of the population, compared to 3% in 2011.

Eric Gallagher was the President of the Church in the 1970s, becoming a well-known figure in Irish politics. He was one of the group of Protestant churchmen who met with Provisional IRA officers in Feakle, County Clare to try to broker peace. The meeting was unsuccessful due to a Garda raid on the hotel.

In 1973, the Fellowship of Independent Methodist Churches (FIMC) was established as a number of theologically conservative congregations departed both the Methodist Church in Ireland and Free Methodist Church due to what they perceived as the rise of Modernism in those denominations.

====Italy====
The Italian Methodist Church () is a small Protestant community in Italy, with around 7,000 members. Since 1975, it is in a formal covenant of partnership with the Waldensian Church, with a total of 45,000 members. Waldensians are a Protestant movement which started in Lyon, France, in the late 1170s.

Italian Methodism has its origins in the Italian Free Church, British Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, and the American Methodist Episcopal Mission. These movements flowered in the second half of the 19th century in the new climate of political and religious freedom that was established with the end of the Papal States and unification of Italy in 1870.

Bertrand M. Tipple, minister of the American Methodist Church in Rome, founded a college there in 1914.

In April 2016, the World Methodist Council opened an Ecumenical Office in Rome. Methodist leaders and the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis, jointly dedicated the new office. It helps facilitate Methodist relationships with the wider Church, especially the Roman Catholic Church.

====Nordic and Baltic countries====
The &quot;Nordic and Baltic Area&quot; of the United Methodist Church covers the Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland) and the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania). Methodism was introduced to the Nordic countries in the late 19th century. Today the United Methodist Church in Norway () is the largest annual meeting in the region with 10,684 members in total (). The United Methodist Church in Sweden () joined the Uniting Church in Sweden in 2011.
In Finland, Methodism arrived through Ostrobothnians sailors in the 1860s, and Methodism spread especially in Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia. The first Methodist congregation was founded in Vaasa in 1881 and the first Finnish-speaking congregation in Pori in 1887. At the turn of the century, the congregation in Vaasa became the largest and most active congregation in Methodism.

====France====
The French Methodist movement was founded in the 1820s by Charles Cook in the village of Congénies in Languedoc near Nîmes and Montpellier. The most important chapel of department was built in 1869, where there had been a Quaker community since the 18th century. Sixteen Methodist congregations voted to join the Reformed Church of France in 1938. In the 1980s, missionary work of a Methodist church in Agen led to new initiatives in Fleurance and Mont de Marsan.

Methodism exists today in France under various names. The best-known is the Union of Evangelical Methodist Churches () or UEEM. It is an autonomous regional conference of the United Methodist Church and is the fruit of a fusion in 2005 between the &quot;Methodist Church of France&quot; and the &quot;Union of Methodist Churches&quot;. , the UEEM has around 1,200 members and 30 ministers.

====Germany====

In Germany, Switzerland and Austria, is the name of the United Methodist Church. The German part of the church had about 52,031 members . Members are organized into three annual conferences: north, east and south. All three annual conferences belong to the &quot;Germany Central Conference&quot;. Methodism is most prevalent in southern Saxony and around Stuttgart.

A Methodist missionary returning from Britain introduced (British) Methodism to Germany in 1830, initially in the region of Württemberg. Methodism was also spread in Germany through the missionary work of the Methodist Episcopal Church which began in 1849 in Bremen, soon spreading to Saxony and other parts of Germany. Other Methodist missionaries of the Evangelical Association went near Stuttgart (Württemberg) in 1850. Further Methodist missionaries of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ worked in Franconia and other parts of Germany from 1869 until 1905. Therefore, Methodism has four roots in Germany.

Early opposition towards Methodism was partly rooted in theological differencesnorthern and eastern regions of Germany were predominantly Lutheran and Reformed, and Methodists were dismissed as fanatics. Methodism was also hindered by its unfamiliar church structure (Connectionalism), which was more centralised than the hierarchical polity in the Lutheran and Reformed churches. After World War I, the 1919 Weimar Constitution allowed Methodists to worship freely and many new chapels were established. In 1936, German Methodists elected their first bishop.

====Hungary====
The first Methodist mission in Hungary was established in 1898 in Bácska, in a then mostly German-speaking town of Verbász (since 1918 part of the Serbian province of Vojvodina). In 1905 a Methodist mission was established also in Budapest. In 1974, a group later known as the Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship seceded from the Hungarian Methodist Church over the question of interference by the communist state.

, the United Methodist Church in Hungary, known locally as the Hungarian Methodist Church (), had 453 professing members in 30 congregations. It runs two student homes, two homes for the elderly, the Forray Methodist High School, the Wesley Scouts and the Methodist Library and Archives. The church has a special ministry among the Roma.

The seceding Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship () also remains Methodist in its organisation and theology. It has eight full congregations and several mission groups, and runs a range of charitable organisations: hostels and soup kitchens for the homeless, a non-denominational theological college, a dozen schools of various kinds, and four old people&#x27;s homes.

Today there are a dozen Methodist/Wesleyan churches and mission organisations in Hungary, but all Methodist churches lost official church status under new legislation passed in 2011, when the number of officially recognized churches in the country fell to 14. However, the list of recognized churches was lengthened to 32 at the end of February 2012. This gave recognition to the Hungarian Methodist Church and the Salvation Army, which was banned in Hungary in 1949 but had returned in 1990, but not to the Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship. The legislation has been strongly criticised by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe as discriminatory.

The Hungarian Methodist Church, the Salvation Army and the Church of the Nazarene and other Wesleyan groups formed the Wesley Theological Alliance for theological and publishing purposes in 1998. Today the Alliance has 10 Wesleyan member churches and organisations. The Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship does not belong to it and has its own publishing arm.

====Russia====
The Methodist Church established several strongholds in RussiaSaint Petersburg in the west and the Vladivostok region in the east, with large Methodist centres in Moscow and Ekaterinburg (former Sverdlovsk). Methodists began their work in the west among Swedish immigrants in 1881 and started their work in the east in 1910. On 26 June 2009, Methodists celebrated the 120th year since Methodism arrived in Czarist Russia by erecting a new Methodist centre in Saint Petersburg. A Methodist presence was continued in Russia for 14 years after the Russian Revolution of 1917 through the efforts of Deaconess Anna Eklund. In 1939, political antagonism stymied the work of the Church and Deaconess Anna Eklund was coerced to return to her native Finland.

After 1989, the Soviet Union allowed greatly increased religious freedoms and this continued after the USSR&#x27;s collapse in 1991. During the 1990s, Methodism experienced a powerful wave of revival in the nation. Three sites in particular carried the torchSamara, Moscow and Ekaterinburg. , the United Methodist Church in Eurasia comprised 116 congregations, each with a native pastor. There are currently 48 students enrolled in residential and extension degree programs at the United Methodist Seminary in Moscow.

===Caribbean===
Methodism came to the Caribbean in 1760 when the planter, lawyer and Speaker of the Antiguan House of Assembly, Nathaniel Gilbert (c. 1719–1774), returned to his sugar estate home in Antigua. A Methodist revival spread in the British West Indies due to the work of British missionaries. Missionaries established societies which would later become the Methodist Church in the Caribbean and the Americas (MCCA). The MCCA has about 62,000 members in over 700 congregations, ministered by 168 pastors. There are smaller Methodist denominations that have seceded from the parent church.

====Antigua====
The story is often told that in 1755, Nathaniel Gilbert, while convalescing, read a treatise of John Wesley, &quot;An Appeal to Men of Reason and Religion&quot; sent to him by his brother Francis. As a result of having read this book Gilbert, two years later, journeyed to England with three of his slaves and there in a drawing room meeting arranged in Wandsworth on 15 January 1759, met the preacher John Wesley. He returned to the Caribbean that same year and on his subsequent return began to preach to his slaves in Antigua.

When Gilbert died in 1774 his work in Antigua was continued by his brother Francis Gilbert to approximately 200 Methodists. However, within a year Francis took ill and returned to Britain and the work was carried on by Sophia Campbell (&quot;a Negress&quot;) and Mary Alley (&quot;a Mulatto&quot;), two devoted women who kept the flock together with class and prayer meetings as well as they could.

On 2 April 1778, John Baxter, a local preacher and skilled shipwright from Chatham in Kent, England, landed at English Harbour in Antigua (now called Nelson&#x27;s Dockyard) where he was offered a post at the naval dockyard. Baxter was a Methodist and had heard of the work of the Gilberts and their need for a new preacher. He began preaching and meeting with the Methodist leaders, and within a year the Methodist community had grown to 600 persons. By 1783, the first Methodist chapel was built in Antigua, with John Baxter as the local preacher, its wooden structure seating some 2,000 people.

====St. Bart&#x27;s====
In 1785, William Turton (1761–1817) a Barbadian son of a planter, met John Baxter in Antigua, and later, as layman, assisted in the Methodist work in the Swedish colony of St. Bartholomew from 1796.

In 1786, the missionary endeavour in the Caribbean was officially recognized by the Methodist Conference in England, and that same year Thomas Coke, having been made Superintendent of the church two years previously in America by Wesley, was travelling to Nova Scotia, but weather forced his ship to Antigua.

====Jamaica====
In 1818 Edward Fraser (1798 – aft. 1850), a privileged Barbadian slave, moved to Bermuda and subsequently met the new minister James Dunbar. The Nova Scotia Methodist Minister noted young Fraser&#x27;s sincerity and commitment to his congregation and encouraged him by appointing him as assistant. By 1827 Fraser assisted in building a new chapel. He was later freed and admitted to the Methodist Ministry to serve in Antigua and Jamaica.

====Barbados====
Following William J. Shrewsbury&#x27;s preaching in the 1820s, Sarah Ann Gill (1779–1866), a free-born black woman, used civil disobedience in an attempt to thwart magistrate rulings that prevented parishioners holding prayer meetings. In hopes of building a new chapel, she paid an extraordinary £1,700-0s–0d and ended up having militia appointed by the Governor to protect her home from demolition.

In 1884 an attempt was made at autonomy with the formation of two West Indian Conferences, however by 1903 the venture had failed. It was not until the 1960s that another attempt was made at autonomy. This second attempt resulted in the emergence of the Methodist Church in the Caribbean and the Americas in May 1967.

Francis Godson (1864–1953), a Methodist minister, who having served briefly in several of the Caribbean islands, eventually immersed himself in helping those in hardship of the First World War in Barbados. He was later appointed to the Legislative Council of Barbados, and fought for the rights of pensioners. He was later followed by renowned Barbadian Augustus Rawle Parkinson (1864–1932), who also was the first principal of the Wesley Hall School, Bridgetown in Barbados (which celebrated its 125th anniversary in September 2009).

In more recent times in Barbados, Victor Alphonso Cooke (born 1930) and Lawrence Vernon Harcourt Lewis (born 1932) are strong influences on the Methodist Church on the island. Their contemporary and late member of the Dalkeith Methodist Church, was the former secretary of the University of the West Indies, consultant of the &quot;Canadian Training Aid Programme&quot; and a man of letters – Francis Woodbine Blackman (1922–2010). It was his research and published works that enlightened much of this information on Caribbean Methodism.

===Africa===
Most Methodist denominations in Africa follow the British Methodist tradition and see the Methodist Church of Great Britain as their mother church. Originally modelled on the British structure, since independence most of these churches have adopted an episcopal model of church governance.

====Nigeria====
The Nigerian Methodist Church is one of the largest Methodist denominations in the world and one of the largest Christian churches in Nigeria, with around two million members in 2000 congregations. It has seen exponential growth since the turn of the millennium.

Christianity was established in Nigeria with the arrival in 1842 of a Wesleyan Methodist missionary. He had come in response to the request for missionaries by the ex-slaves who returned to Nigeria from Sierra Leone. From the mission stations established in Badagry and Abeokuta, the Methodist church spread to various parts of the country west of the River Niger and part of the north. In 1893 missionaries of the Primitive Methodist Church arrived from Fernando Po, an island off the southern coast of Nigeria. From there the Methodist Church spread to other parts of the country, east of the River Niger and also to parts of the north. The church west of the River Niger and part of the north was known as the Western Nigeria District and east of the Niger and another part of the north as the Eastern Nigeria District. Both existed independently of each other until 1962 when they constituted the Conference of Methodist Church Nigeria. The conference is composed of seven districts. The church has continued to spread into new areas and has established a department for evangelism and appointed a director of evangelism. An episcopal system of church governance adopted in 1976 was not fully accepted by all sections of the church until the two sides came together and resolved to end the disagreement. A new constitution was ratified in 1990. The system is still episcopal but the points which caused discontent were amended to be acceptable to both sides. Today, the Nigerian Methodist Church has a prelate, eight archbishops and 44 bishops.

====Ghana====
Methodist Church Ghana is one of the largest Methodist denominations, with around 800,000 members in 2,905 congregations, ministered by 700 pastors. It has fraternal links with the British Methodist and United Methodist churches worldwide.

Methodism in Ghana came into existence as a result of the missionary activities of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, inaugurated with the arrival of Joseph Rhodes Dunwell to the Gold Coast in 1835. Like the mother church, the Methodist Church in Ghana was established by people of Protestant background. Roman Catholic and Anglican missionaries came to the Gold Coast from the 15th century. A school was established in Cape Coast by the Anglicans during the time of Philip Quaque, a Ghanaian priest. Those who came out of this school had Bible copies and study supplied by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. A member of the resulting Bible study groups, William De-Graft, requested Bibles through Captain Potter of the ship &quot;Congo&quot;. Not only were Bibles sent, but also a Methodist missionary. In the first eight years of the Church&#x27;s life, 11 out of 21 missionaries who worked in the Gold Coast died. Thomas Birch Freeman, who arrived at the Gold Coast in 1838 was a pioneer of missionary expansion. Between 1838 and 1857 he carried Methodism from the coastal areas to Kumasi in the Asante hinterland of the Gold Coast. He also established Methodist Societies in Badagry and AbeoKuta in Nigeria with the assistance of William De-Graft.

By 1854, the church was organized into circuits constituting a district with T. B. Freeman as chairman. Freeman was replaced in 1856 by William West. The district was divided and extended to include areas in the then Gold Coast and Nigeria by the synod in 1878, a move confirmed at the British Conference. The districts were Gold Coast District, with T. R. Picot as chairman and Yoruba and Popo District, with John Milum as chairman. Methodist evangelisation of northern Gold Coast began in 1910. After a long period of conflict with the colonial government, missionary work was established in 1955. Paul Adu was the first indigenous missionary to northern Gold Coast.

In July 1961, the Methodist Church in Ghana became autonomous, and was called the Methodist Church Ghana, based on a deed of foundation, part of the church&#x27;s &quot;Constitution and Standing Orders&quot;.

====Southern Africa====

The Methodist Church operates across South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, with a limited presence in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It is a member church of the World Methodist Council.

Methodism in Southern Africa began as a result of lay Christian work by an Irish soldier of the English Regiment, John Irwin, who was stationed at the Cape and began to hold prayer meetings as early as 1795. The first Methodist lay preacher at the Cape, George Middlemiss, was a soldier of the 72nd Regiment of the British Army stationed at the Cape in 1805. This foundation paved the way for missionary work by Methodist missionary societies from Great Britain, many of whom sent missionaries with the 1820 English settlers to the Western and Eastern Cape. Among the most notable of the early missionaries were Barnabas Shaw and William Shaw. The largest group was the Wesleyan Methodist Church, but there were a number of others that joined to form the Methodist Church of South Africa, later known as the Methodist Church of Southern Africa.

The Methodist Church of Southern Africa is the largest mainline Protestant denomination in South Africa7.3% of the South African population recorded their religious affiliation as &#x27;Methodist&#x27; in the last national census.

===Asia===

====China====

Methodism was brought to China in the autumn of 1847 by the Methodist Episcopal Church. The first missionaries sent out were Judson Dwight Collins and Moses Clark White, who sailed from Boston 15 April 1847, and reached Fuzhou 6 September. They were followed by Henry Hickok and Robert Samuel Maclay, who arrived 15 April 1848. In 1857, the first convert was baptised in connection with its labours. In August 1856, a brick built church was dedicated named the &quot;Church of the True God&quot; (), the first substantial church building erected in Fuzhou by Protestant Missions. In the winter of the same year another brick built church, located on the hill in the suburbs on the south bank of the Min, was finished and dedicated, called the &quot;Church of Heavenly Peace&quot;. In 1862, the number of members was 87. The Fuzhou Conference was organized by Isaac W. Wiley on 6 December 1867, by which time the number of members and probationers had reached 2,011.

Hok Chau (; also known as Lai-Tong Chau, ) was the first ordained Chinese minister of the South China District of the Methodist Church (incumbent 1877–1916). Benjamin Hobson, a medical missionary sent by the London Missionary Society in 1839, set up Wai Ai Clinic (). Liang Fa, Hok Chau and others worked there. Liang baptized Chau in 1852. The Methodist Church based in Britain sent missionary George Piercy to China. In 1851, Piercy went to Guangzhou (Canton), where he worked in a trading company. In 1853, he started a church in Guangzhou. In 1877, Chau was ordained by the Methodist Church, where he pastored for 39 years.

In 1867, the mission sent out the first missionaries to Central China, who began work at Jiujiang. In 1869, missionaries were also sent to the capital city Beijing, where they laid the foundations of the work of the North China Mission. In November 1880, the West China Mission was established in Sichuan Province. In 1896, the work in the Hinghua prefecture (modern-day Putian) and surrounding regions was also organized as a Mission Conference.

In 1947, the Methodist Church in the Republic of China celebrated its centenary. In 1949, however, the Methodist Church moved to Taiwan with the Kuomintang government.

====Hong Kong====
====India====

Methodism came to India twice, in 1817 and in 1856, according to P. Dayanandan who has extensively researched the subject. Thomas Coke and six other missionaries set sail for India on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1814. Coke, then 66, died en route. Rev. James Lynch was the one who finally arrived in Madras in 1817 at a place called Black Town (Broadway), later known as George Town. Lynch conducted the first Methodist missionary service on 2 March 1817, in a stable.

The first Methodist church was dedicated in 1819 at Royapettah. A chapel at Broadway (Black Town) was later built and dedicated on 25 April 1822. This church was rebuilt in 1844 since the earlier structure was collapsing. At this time there were about 100 Methodist members in all of Madras, and they were either Europeans or Eurasians (European and Indian descent). Among names associated with the founding period of Methodism in India are Elijah Hoole and Thomas Cryer, who came as missionaries to Madras.

In 1857, the Methodist Episcopal Church started its work in India, and with prominent evangelists like William Taylor of the Emmanuel Methodist Church, Vepery, born in 1874. Taylor and the evangelist James Mills Thoburn established the Thoburn Memorial Church in Calcutta in 1873 and the Calcutta Boys&#x27; School in 1877.

In 1947, the Wesleyan Methodist Church in India merged with Presbyterians, Anglicans and other Protestant churches to form the Church of South India while the American Methodist Church remained affiliated as the Methodist Church in Southern Asia (MCSA) to the mother church in the USA – the United Methodist Church until 1981, when by an enabling act, the Methodist Church in India (MCI) became an autonomous church in India. Today, the Methodist Church in India is governed by the General Conference of the Methodist Church of India headed by six bishops, with headquarters in Mumbai, India.

====Malaysia and Singapore====

Missionaries from Britain, North America, and Australia founded Methodist churches in many Commonwealth countries. These are now independent from their former &quot;mother&quot; churches. In addition to the churches, these missionaries often also founded schools to serve the local community. A good example of such schools are the Methodist Boys&#x27; School in Kuala Lumpur, Methodist Girls&#x27; School and Methodist Boys&#x27; School in George Town, and Anglo-Chinese School, Methodist Girls&#x27; School, Paya Lebar Methodist Girls School and Fairfield Methodist Schools in Singapore.

====Philippines====
Methodism in the Philippines began shortly after the United States acquired the Philippines in 1898 as a result the Spanish–American War. On 21 June 1898, after the Battle of Manila Bay but before the Treaty of Paris, executives of the American Mission Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church expressed their desire to join other Protestant denominations in starting mission work in the islands and to enter into a Comity Agreement that would facilitate the establishment of such missions. The first Protestant worship service was conducted on 28 August 1898 by an American military chaplain named George C. Stull. Stull was an ordained Methodist minister from the Montana Annual Conference of The Methodist Episcopal Church (later part of the United Methodist Church after 1968).
Methodist and Wesleyan traditions in the Philippines are shared by three of the largest mainline Protestant churches in the country: The United Methodist Church in the Philippines, &quot;Iglesia Evangelica Metodista En Las Islas Filipinas&quot; (&quot;Evangelical Methodist Church in the Philippine Islands&quot;, abbreviated IEMELIF), and The United Church of Christ in the Philippines. There are also evangelical Protestant churches in the country of the Methodist tradition like the Wesleyan Church of the Philippines, the Free Methodist Church of the Philippines, and the Church of the Nazarene. There are also the IEMELIF Reform Movement (IRM), The Wesleyan (Pilgrim Holiness) Church of the Philippines, the Philippine Bible Methodist Church, Incorporated, the Pentecostal Free Methodist Church, Incorporated, the Fundamental Christian Methodist Church, The Reformed Methodist Church, Incorporated, The Methodist Church of the Living Bread, Incorporated, and the Wesley Evangelical Methodist Church &amp; Mission, Incorporated.

There are three episcopal areas of the United Methodist Church in the Philippines: the Baguio Episcopal Area, Davao Episcopal Area and Manila Episcopal Area.

A call for autonomy from groups within the United Methodist Church in the Philippines was discussed at several conferences led mostly by episcopal candidates. This led to the establishment of the &quot;Ang Iglesia Metodista sa Pilipinas&quot; (&quot;The Methodist Church in the Philippines&quot;) in 2010, led by Bishop Lito C. Tangonan, George Buenaventura, Chita Milan and Joe Frank E. Zuñiga. The group finally declared full autonomy and legal incorporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission was approved on 7 December 2011 with papers held by present procurators. It now has 126 local churches in Metro Manila, Palawan, Bataan, Zambales, Pangasinan, Bulacan, Aurora, Nueva Ecija, as well as parts of Pampanga and Cavite. Tangonan was consecrated as the denomination&#x27;s first Presiding Bishop on 17 March 2012.

====South Korea====

The Korean Methodist Church (KMC) is one of the largest churches in South Korea with around 1.5 million members and 8,306 ministers. Methodism in Korea grew out of British and American mission work which began in the late 19th century. The first missionary was Robert Samuel Maclay of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who sailed from Japan in 1884 and was given the authority of medical and schooling permission from emperor Gojong. The Korean church became fully autonomous in 1930, retaining affiliation with Methodist churches in America and later the United Methodist Church. The church experienced rapid growth in membership throughout most of the 20th centuryin spite of the Korean Warbefore stabilizing in the 1990s. The KMC is a member of the World Methodist Council and hosted the first Asia Methodist Convention in 2001.

There are many Korean-language Methodist churches in North America catering to Korean-speaking immigrants.

====Taiwan====
In 1947, the Methodist Church in the Republic of China celebrated its centenary. In 1949, however, the Methodist Church moved to Taiwan with the Kuomintang government. On 21 June 1953, Taipei Methodist Church was erected, then local churches and chapels with a baptized membership numbering over 2,500. Various types of educational, medical and social services are provided (including Tunghai University). In 1972, the Methodist Church in the Republic of China became autonomous, and the first bishop was installed in 1986.

===Americas===
====Brazil====
The Methodist Church in Brazil was founded by American missionaries in 1867 after an initial unsuccessful founding in 1835. It has grown steadily since, becoming autonomous in 1930. In the 1970s it ordained its first woman minister. In 1975 it also founded the first Methodist university in Latin America, the Methodist University of Piracicaba. , the Brazilian Methodist Church is divided into eight annual conferences with 162,000 members.

====Canada====


The father of Methodism in Canada was Rev. Coughlan, who arrived in Newfoundland in 1763, where he opened a school and travelled widely.

The second was William Black (1760–1834) who began preaching in settlements along the Petitcodiac River of New Brunswick in 1781. A few years afterwards, Methodist Episcopal circuit riders from the U.S. state of New York began to arrive in Canada West at Niagara, and the north shore of Lake Erie in 1786, and at the Kingston region on the northeast shore of Lake Ontario in the early 1790s. At the time the region was part of British North America and became part of Upper Canada after the Constitutional Act of 1791. Upper and Lower Canada were both parts of the New York Episcopal Methodist Conference until 1810 when they were transferred to the newly formed Genesee Conference. Reverend Major George Neal began to preach in Niagara in October 1786 and was ordained in 1810 by Bishop Philip Asbury, at the Lyons, New York Methodist Conference. He was Canada&#x27;s first saddlebag preacher and travelled from Lake Ontario to Detroit for 50 years preaching the gospel.

The spread of Methodism in the Canadas was seriously disrupted by the War of 1812 but quickly gained lost ground after the Treaty of Ghent was signed in 1815. In 1817, the British Wesleyans arrived in the Canadas from the Maritimes but by 1820 had agreed, with the Episcopal Methodists, to confine their work to Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) while the latter would confine themselves to Upper Canada (present-day Ontario). In the summer of 1818, the first place of public worship was erected for the Wesleyan Methodists in York, later Toronto. The chapel for the First Methodist Church was built on the corner of King Street and Jordan Street, the entire cost of the building was $250, an amount that took the congregation three years to raise. In 1828, Upper Canadian Methodists were permitted by the General Conference in the United States to form an independent Canadian Conference and, in 1833, the Canadian Conference merged with the British Wesleyans to form the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Canada. In 1884, most Canadian Methodists were brought under the umbrella of the Methodist Church, Canada.

In the fall of 1873 and winter of 1874, General Superintendent B. T. Roberts of the Free Methodist Church visited Scarborough on the invitation of Robert Loveless, a Primitive Methodist layman. Later, in 1876 while presiding over the very young North Michigan Conference, he read conference appointments that assigned C.H. Sage his field of labour—Canada. This led to the expansion of the Free Methodist Church in Canada. 

In 1925, the Methodist Church, Canada and most Presbyterian congregations (then by far the largest Protestant communion in Canada), most Congregational Union of Ontario and Quebec congregations, Union Churches in Western Canada, and the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal merged to form the United Church of Canada. In 1968, the Evangelical United Brethren Church&#x27;s Canadian congregations joined the United Church of Canada. 

The Free Methodist Church in Canada is the largest Methodist denomination in the country at present. A smaller denomination, the British Methodist Episcopal Church, remains active today as well.

====Mexico====
The Methodist Church came to Mexico in 1872, with the arrival of two Methodist commissioners from the United States to observe the possibilities of evangelistic work in México. In December 1872, Bishop Gilbert Haven arrived in Mexico City. He was ordered by M. D. William Butler to go to México. Bishop John C. Keener arrived from the Methodist Episcopal Church, South in January 1873.

In 1874, M. D. William Butler established the first Protestant Methodist school of México, in Puebla. The school was founded under the name &quot;Instituto Metodista Mexicano&quot;. Today the school is called &quot;Instituto Mexicano Madero&quot;. It is still a Methodist school, and it is one of the most elite, selective, expensive and prestigious private schools in the country, with two campuses in Puebla State, and one in Oaxaca. A few years later the principal of the school created a Methodist university.

On 18 January 1885, the first Annual Conference of the United Episcopal Church of México was established.

====United States====

Wesley came to believe that the New Testament evidence did not leave the power of ordination to the priesthood in the hands of bishops but that other priests could ordain. In 1784, he ordained preachers for Scotland, England, and America, with power to administer the sacraments (this was a major reason for Methodism&#x27;s final split from the Church of England after Wesley&#x27;s death). At that time, Wesley sent Thomas Coke to America. Francis Asbury founded the Methodist Episcopal Church at the Baltimore Christmas Conference in 1784; Coke (already ordained in the Church of England) ordained Asbury deacon, elder, and bishop each on three successive days. Circuit riders, many of whom were laymen, travelled by horseback to preach the gospel and establish churches in many places. One of the most famous circuit riders was Robert Strawbridge who lived in the vicinity of Carroll County, Maryland, soon after arriving in the Colonies around 1760.

The First Great Awakening was a religious movement in the 1730s and 1740s, beginning in New Jersey, then spreading to New England, and eventually south into Virginia and North Carolina. George Whitefield played a major role, traveling across the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style, accepting everyone as his audience.

The new style of sermons and the way people practiced their faith breathed new life into religion in America. People became passionately and emotionally involved in their religion, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. People began to study the Bible at home. The effect was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the Protestant Reformation.
The Second Great Awakening was a nationwide wave of revivals, from 1790 to 1840. In New England, the renewed interest in religion inspired a wave of social activism among Yankees; Methodism grew and established several colleges, notably Boston University. In the &quot;burned over district&quot; of western New York, the spirit of revival burned brightly. Methodism saw the emergence of a Holiness movement. In the west, especially at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, and in Tennessee, the revival strengthened the Methodists and the Baptists. Methodism grew rapidly in the Second Great Awakening, becoming the nation&#x27;s largest denomination by 1820. From 58,000 members in 1790, it reached 258,000 in 1820 and 1,661,000 in 1860, growing by a factor of 28.6 in 70 years, while the total American population grew by a factor of eight. Other denominations also used revivals, but the Methodists grew fastest of all because &quot;they combined popular appeal with efficient organization under the command of missionary bishops.&quot; Methodism attracted German immigrants, and the first German Methodist Church was erected in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Disputes over slavery placed the church in difficulty in the first half of the 19th century, with the northern church leaders fearful of a split with the South, and reluctant to take a stand. The Wesleyan Methodist Connexion (later renamed the Wesleyan Methodist Church) and the Free Methodist Church were formed by staunch abolitionists, and the Free Methodists were especially active in the Underground Railroad, which helped to free slaves. In 1962, the Evangelical Wesleyan Church separated from the Free Methodist Church. In 1968 the Wesleyan Methodist Church and Pilgrim Holiness Church merged to form the Wesleyan Church; a significant amount dissented from this decision resulting in the independence of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and the formation of the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches, both of which fall within the conservative holiness movement.

In a much larger split, in 1845 at Louisville, Kentucky, the churches of the slaveholding states left the Methodist Episcopal Church and formed the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The northern and southern branches were reunited in 1939, when slavery was no longer an issue. In this merger also joined the Methodist Protestant Church. Some southerners, more conservative in theology, opposed the merger, and formed the Southern Methodist Church in 1940.

The Third Great Awakening from 1858 to 1908 saw enormous growth in Methodist membership, and a proliferation of institutions such as colleges (e.g., Morningside College). Methodists were often involved in the &quot;Missionary Awakening&quot; and the Social Gospel Movement. The awakening in so many cities in 1858 started the movement, but in the North it was interrupted by the Civil War. In the South, on the other hand, the Civil War stimulated revivals, especially in Lee&#x27;s army.

In 1914–1917 many Methodist ministers made strong pleas for world peace. President Woodrow Wilson (a Presbyterian), promised &quot;a war to end all wars&quot;, using language of a future peace that had been a watchword for the postmillennial movement. In the 1930s many Methodists favored isolationist policies. Thus in 1936, Methodist Bishop James Baker, of the San Francisco Conference, released a poll of ministers showing 56% opposed warfare. However, the Methodist Federation called for a boycott of Japan, which had invaded China and was disrupting missionary activity there. In Chicago, 62 local African Methodist Episcopal churches voted their support for the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s policy, while opposing any plan to send American troops overseas to fight. When war came in 1941, the vast majority of Methodists supported the national war effort, but there were also a few (673) conscientious objectors.

The United Methodist Church (UMC) was formed in 1968 as a result of a merger between the Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB) and the Methodist Church. The former church had resulted from mergers of several groups of German Methodist heritage; however, there was no longer any need or desire to worship in the German language. The latter church was a result of union between the Methodist Protestant Church and the northern and southern factions of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The merged church had approximately nine million members as of the late 1990s. While United Methodist Church in America membership has been declining, associated groups in developing countries are growing rapidly. Prior to the merger that led to the formation of the United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Methodist Church entered into a schism with the Methodist Church, citing modernism in its parent body as the reason for the departure in 1946.
American Methodist churches are generally organized on a &quot;connectional&quot; model, related, but not identical to that used in Britain. Pastors are assigned to congregations by bishops, distinguishing it from presbyterian government. Methodist denominations typically give lay members representation at regional and national Conferences at which the business of the church is conducted, making it different from most episcopal government. This connectional organizational model differs further from the congregational model, for example of Baptist, and Congregationalist Churches, among others.

In addition to the United Methodist Church, there are over 40 other denominations that descend from John Wesley&#x27;s Methodist movement. Some, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Free Methodists and the Wesleyan Church (formerly Wesleyan Methodist), are explicitly Methodist. There are also independent Methodist churches, many of which are affiliated with the Association of Independent Methodists. The Salvation Army and the Church of the Nazarene adhere to Methodist theology.

The Holiness Revival was primarily among people of Methodist persuasion, who felt that the church had once again become apathetic, losing the Wesleyan zeal. Some important events of this revival were the writings of Phoebe Palmer during the mid-1800s, the establishment of the first of many holiness camp meetings at Vineland, New Jersey, in 1867, and the founding of Asbury College (1890), and other similar institutions in the U.S. around the turn of the 20th century.

In 2020, United Methodists announced a plan to split the denomination over the issue of same-sex marriage, which resulted in traditionalist clergy, laity and theologians forming the Global Methodist Church, a traditionalist Methodist denomination that came into being on 1 May 2022.

===Oceania===
Methodism is particularly widespread in some Pacific Island nations, such as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga.

====Australia====
In the 19th century there were annual conferences in each Australasian colony (including New Zealand). Various branches of Methodism in Australia merged during the 20 years from 1881. The Methodist Church of Australasia was formed on 1 January 1902 when five Methodist denominations in Australia – the Wesleyan Methodist Church, the Primitive Methodists, the Bible Christian Church, the United Methodist Free and the Methodist New Connexion Churches merged. In polity it largely followed the Wesleyan Methodist Church.

In 1945 Kingsley Ridgway offered himself as a Melbourne-based &quot;field representative&quot; for a possible Australian branch of the Wesleyan Methodist Church of America, after meeting an American serviceman who was a member of that denomination. The Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia was founded on his work.
The Methodist Church of Australasia merged with the majority of the Presbyterian Church of Australia and the Congregational Union of Australia in 1977, becoming the Uniting Church. The Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia and some independent congregations chose not to join the union.

Wesley Mission in Pitt Street, Sydney, the largest parish in the Uniting Church, remains strongly in the Wesleyan tradition. There are many local churches named after John Wesley.

From the mid-1980s a number of independent Methodist churches were founded by missionaries and other members from the Methodist Churches of Malaysia and Singapore. Some of these came together to form what is now known as the Chinese Methodist Church in Australia in 1993, and it held its first full Annual Conference in 2002. Since the 2000s many independent Methodist churches have also been established or grown by Tongan immigrants.

====Fiji====
As a result of the early efforts of missionaries, most of the natives of the Fiji Islands were converted to Methodism in the 1840s and 1850s. According to the 2007 census, 34.6% of the population (including almost two-thirds of ethnic Fijians), are adherents of Methodism, making Fiji one of the most Methodist nations. The Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma, the largest religious denomination, is an important social force along with the traditional chiefly system. In the past, the church once called for a theocracy and fueled anti-Hindu sentiment.

====New Zealand====

In June 1823 Wesleydale, the first Wesleyan Methodist mission in New Zealand, was established at Kaeo. The Methodist Church of New Zealand, which is directly descended from the 19th-century missionaries, was the fourth-most common Christian denomination recorded in the 2018 New Zealand census.

Since the early 1990s, missionaries and other Methodists from Malaysia and Singapore established Methodist churches around major urban areas in New Zealand. These congregations came together to form the Chinese Methodist Church in New Zealand (CMCNZ) in 2003.{

====Samoan Islands====
The Methodist Church is the third largest denomination throughout the Samoan Islands, in both Samoa and American Samoa. In 1868, Piula Theological College was established in Lufilufi on the north coast of Upolu island in Samoa and serves as the main headquarters of the Methodist church in the country. The college includes the historic Piula Monastery as well as Piula Cave Pool, a natural spring situated beneath the church by the sea.

====Tonga====

Methodism had a particular resonance with the inhabitants of Tonga. In the 1830s Wesleyan missionaries converted paramount chief Taufa&#x27;ahau Tupou who in turn converted fellow islanders. Today, Methodism is represented on the islands by the Free Church of Tonga and the Free Wesleyan Church, which is the largest church in Tonga. 48% of Tongans adhered to Methodist churches. The royal family of the country are prominent members of the Free Wesleyan Church, and the late king was a lay preacher. Tongan Methodist minister Sione &#x27;Amanaki Havea developed coconut theology, which tailors theology to a Pacific Islands context.

==Ecumenical relations==
Many Methodists have been involved in the ecumenical movement, which has sought to unite the fractured denominations of Christianity. Because Methodism grew out of the Church of England, a denomination from which neither of the Wesley brothers seceded, some Methodist scholars and historians, such as Rupert E. Davies, have regarded their &#x27;movement&#x27; more as a preaching order within wider Christian life than as a church, comparing them with the Franciscans, who formed a religious order within the medieval European church and not a separate denomination. Certainly, Methodists have been deeply involved in early examples of church union, especially the United Church of Canada and the Church of South India.

A disproportionate number of Methodists take part in inter-faith dialogue. For example, Wesley Ariarajah, a long-serving director of the World Council of Churches&#x27; sub-unit on &quot;Dialogue with People of Living Faiths and Ideologies&quot; is a Methodist.

In October 1999, an executive committee of the World Methodist Council resolved to explore the possibility of its member churches becoming associated with the doctrinal agreement which had been reached by the Catholic Church and Lutheran World Federation (LWF). In May 2006, the International Methodist–Catholic Dialogue Commission completed its most recent report, entitled &quot;The Grace Given You in Christ: Catholics and Methodists Reflect Further on the Church&quot;, and submitted the text to Methodist and Catholic authorities. In July of the same year, in Seoul, South Korea, the Member Churches of the World Methodist Council (WMC) voted to approve and sign a &quot;Methodist Statement of Association&quot; with the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, the agreement which was reached and officially accepted in 1999 by the Catholic Church and the Lutheran World Federation and which proclaimed that:

&quot;Together we confess: By grace alone, in faith in Christ&#x27;s saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works... as sinners our new life is solely due to the forgiving and renewing mercy that God imparts as a gift and that we receive in faith, and never can merit in any way,&quot; affirming &quot;fundamental doctrinal agreement&quot; concerning justification between the Catholic Church, the LWF, and the World Methodist Council.

This is not to say there is perfect agreement between the three denominational traditions; while Catholics and Methodists believe that salvation involves cooperation between God and man, Lutherans believe that God brings about the salvation of individuals without any cooperation on their part.

Commenting on the ongoing dialogues with Catholic Church leaders, Ken Howcroft, Methodist minister and the Ecumenical Officer for the Methodist Church of Great Britain, noted that &quot;these conversations have been immensely fruitful.&quot; Methodists are increasingly recognizing that the 15 centuries prior to the Reformation constitute a shared history with Catholics, and are gaining new appreciation for neglected aspects of the Catholic tradition. There are, however, important unresolved doctrinal differences separating Roman Catholicism and Methodism, which include &quot;the nature and validity of the ministry of those who preside at the Eucharist [Holy Communion], the precise meaning of the Eucharist as the sacramental &#x27;memorial&#x27; of Christ&#x27;s saving death and resurrection, the particular way in which Christ is present in Holy Communion, and the link between eucharistic communion and ecclesial communion.

In the 1960s, the Methodist Church of Great Britain made ecumenical overtures to the Church of England, aimed at denominational union. Formally, these failed when they were rejected by the Church of England&#x27;s General Synod in 1972; conversations and co-operation continued, however, leading in 2003 to the signing of a covenant between the two churches. From the 1970s onward, the Methodist Church also started several Local Ecumenical Projects (LEPs, later renamed Local Ecumenical Partnerships) with local neighbouring denominations, which involved sharing churches, schools and in some cases ministers. In many towns and villages Methodists are involved in LEPs which are sometimes with Anglican or Baptist churches, but most commonly Methodist and United Reformed Church. In terms of belief, practice and churchmanship, many Methodists see themselves as closer to the United Reformed Church (another Nonconformist church) than to the Church of England. In the 1990s and early 21st century, the British Methodist Church was involved in the Scottish Church Initiative for Union, seeking greater unity with the established and Presbyterian Church of Scotland, the Scottish Episcopal Church and the United Reformed Church in Scotland.

The Methodist Church of Great Britain is a member of several ecumenical organisations, including the World Council of Churches, the Conference of European Churches, the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe, Churches Together in Britain and Ireland, Churches Together in England, Action of Churches Together in Scotland and Cytûn (Wales).

Methodist denominations in the United States have also strengthened ties with other Christian traditions. In April 2005, bishops in the United Methodist Church approved &quot;A Proposal for Interim Eucharistic Sharing.&quot; This document was the first step toward full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). The ELCA approved this same document in August 2005. At the 2008 General Conference, the United Methodist Church approved full communion with the ELCA. The UMC is also in dialogue with the Episcopal Church for full communion. The UMC and ELC worked together on a document called &quot;Confessing Our Faith Together&quot;.

<text>Mancala ( &quot;manqalah&quot;) is a family of two-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans, or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. The objective is usually to capture all or some set of the opponent&#x27;s pieces.

Versions of the game date back past the 3rd century and evidence suggests the game existed in Ancient Egypt. It is among the oldest known games to still be widely played today.

== History ==
According to some experts, the oldest discovered Mancala boards are in &#x27;Ain Ghazal, Jordan in the floor of a Neolithic dwelling as early as ~5,870 BC although this claim has been disputed by others. More recent and undisputed claims concern artifacts from modern-day Israel in the city of Gedera in an excavated Roman bathhouse where pottery boards and rock cuts that were unearthed dating back to between the 2nd and 3rd century AD. Among other early evidence of the game are fragments of a pottery board and several rock cuts found in Aksumite areas in Matara (in Eritrea) and Yeha (in Ethiopia), which are dated by archaeologists to between the 6th and 7th centuries AD. 

The oldest mention of the game is in the &quot;Kitab al-Aghani&quot; (&quot;Book of Songs&quot;) of the 10th-century, attributed to Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani. The game may have been mentioned by Giyorgis of Segla in his 14th century Geʽez text &quot;Mysteries of Heaven and Earth&quot;, where he refers to a game called qarqis, a term used in Geʽez to refer to both Gebet&#x27;a (mancala) and &quot;Sant&#x27;araz&quot; (modern &quot;sent&#x27;erazh&quot;, Ethiopian chess). Evidence of the game has also been uncovered in Kenya.

The games have also existed in Eastern Europe. In Estonia, it was once very popular (see &quot;Bohnenspiel&quot;), and likewise in Bosnia (where it is called Ban-Ban and still played today), Serbia, and Greece (&quot;Mandoli&quot;, Cyclades). Two mancala tables from the early 18th century are to be found in Weikersheim Castle in southern Germany. In western Europe, it never caught on but was documented by Oxford University orientalist Thomas Hyde.

In the United States a traditional mancala game called Warra was still played in Louisiana in the early 20th century, and a commercial version called Kalah became popular in the 1940s. In Cape Verde, mancala is known as &quot;ouril&quot;. It is played on the Islands and was brought to the United States by Cape Verdean immigrants. It is played to this day in Cape Verdean communities in New England.

Historians may have found evidence of Mancala in slave communities of the Americas. The game was brought to the Americas by enslaved Africans during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The game was played by enslaved Africans to foster community and develop social skills. Archeologists may have found evidence of the game Mancala played in Nashville, Tennessee at the Hermitage Plantation.

Recent studies of mancala rules have given insight into the distribution of mancala. This distribution has been linked to migration routes, which may go back several hundred years.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;mancala&quot; () is a tool noun derived from an Arabic root &quot;naqala&quot; () meaning &quot;to move&quot;.

== General gameplay ==
Most mancala games have a common gameplay. Players begin by placing a certain number of seeds, prescribed for the particular game, in each of the pits on the game board. A player may count their stones to plot the game. A turn consists of removing all seeds from a pit, &quot;sowing&quot; the seeds (placing one in each of the following pits in sequence), and capturing based on the state of the board. The game&#x27;s object is to plant the most seeds in the bank. This leads to the English phrase &quot;count and capture&quot; sometimes used to describe the gameplay. Although the details differ greatly, this general sequence applies to all games.

If playing in capture mode, once a player ends their turn in an empty pit on their own side, they capture the opponent&#x27;s pieces directly across. Once captured, the player gets to put the seeds in their own bank. After capturing, the opponent forfeits a turn.

=== Equipment ===
Equipment is typically a board, constructed of various materials, with a series of holes arranged in rows, usually two or four. The materials include clay and other shapeable materials. Some games are more often played with holes dug in the earth, or carved in stone. The holes may be referred to as &quot;depressions&quot;, &quot;pits&quot;, or &quot;houses&quot;. Sometimes, large holes on the ends of the board called &quot;stores&quot;, are used for holding the pieces.

Playing pieces are seeds, beans, stones, cowry shells, half-marbles or other small undifferentiated counters that are placed in and transferred about the holes during play.

Board configurations vary among different games but also within variations of a given game; for example Endodoi is played on boards from 2×6 to 2×10. The largest are Tchouba (Mozambique) with a board of 160 (4×40) holes requiring 320 seeds, and En Gehé (Tanzania), played on longer rows with up to 50 pits (a total of 2×50=100) and using 400 seeds. The most minimalistic variants are Nano-Wari and Micro-Wari, created by the Bulgarian ethnologue Assia Popova. The Nano-Wari board has eight seeds in just two pits; Micro-Wari has a total of four seeds in four pits.

With a two-rank board, players usually are considered to control their respective sides of the board, although moves often are made into the opponent&#x27;s side. With a four-rank board, players control an inner row and an outer row, and a player&#x27;s seeds will remain in these closest two rows unless the opponent captures them.

=== Objective ===

The objective of most two- and three-row mancala games is to capture more stones than the opponent; in four-row games, one usually seeks to leave the opponent with no legal move or sometimes to capture all counters in their front row.

At the beginning of a player&#x27;s turn, they select a hole with seeds that will be sown around the board. This selection is often limited to holes on the current player&#x27;s side of the board, as well as holes with a certain minimum number of seeds.
In a process known as &quot;sowing&quot;, all the seeds from a hole are dropped one by one into subsequent holes in a motion wrapping around the board. Sowing is an apt name for this activity, since not only are many games traditionally played with seeds but placing seeds one at a time in different holes reflects the physical act of sowing. If the sowing action stops after dropping the last seed, the game is considered a &quot;single lap&quot; game.

&quot;Multiple laps&quot; or &quot;relay sowing&quot; is a frequent feature of mancala games, although not universal. When relay sowing, if the last seed during sowing lands in an occupied hole, all the contents of that hole, including the last sown seed, are immediately re-sown from the hole. The process usually will continue until sowing ends in an empty hole. Another common way to receive &quot;multiple laps&quot; is when the final seed sown lands in your designated hole.

Many games from the Indian subcontinent use &quot;pussakanawa laps&quot;. These are like standard multi-laps, but instead of continuing the movement with the contents of the last hole filled, a player continues with the next hole. A pussakanawa lap move will then end when a lap ends just before an empty hole.

If a player ends their stone with a point move they get a &quot;free turn&quot;.

=== Capturing ===

Depending on the last hole sown in a lap, a player may &quot;capture&quot; stones from the board. The exact requirements for capture, as well as what is done with captured stones, vary considerably among games. Typically, a capture requires sowing to end in a hole with a certain number of stones, ending across the board from stones in specific configurations or landing in an empty hole adjacent to an opponent&#x27;s hole that contains one or more pieces.

Another common way of capturing is to capture the stones that reach a certain number of seeds at any moment.

Also, several games include the notion of capturing holes, and thus all seeds sown on a captured hole belong at the end of the game to the player who captured it.

== Names and variants ==

The name is a classification or type of game, rather than any specific game. Some of the most popular mancala games (concerning distribution area, the numbers of players and tournaments, and publications) are:
* Bao – played in most of East Africa including Kenya, Tanzania, Comoros, Madagascar, Malawi, as well as some areas of DR Congo, and Burundi.
* Gebeta (Tigrinya: ገበጣ) – played in Ethiopia and Eritrea (especially in Tigray).
* Kalah – North American variation, the most popular variant in the Western world.
* Omweso (&quot;mweso&quot;) – played in Uganda, some players and tournaments also in the UK.
* Oware (&quot;awalé, awélé, awari&quot;) – Ashanti, but played world-wide including Europe (England, France, Catalonia, Portugal), where it is mostly played (but not exclusively) by expatriates; close variants in West Africa (e.g., Ayo by Yorubas (Nigeria), Ouri (Cape Verde)) and Warri in the Caribbean.
* Pallanguzhi – played in Tamil Nadu, India.
* Ovvaḷugoṇḍi – played in Maldives
* Songo – played in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, also among expatriates in France.
* Sungka – Popular variants are known as Congklak (a.k.a. &quot;congkak&quot;, &quot;congka&quot;, &quot;tjongklak&quot;, &quot;jongklak&quot;) and Dakon (or ) – played in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei; boards are often sold in fairtrade shops in Germany and other European countries. 
* Toguz korgool or Toguz kumalak – played in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, tournaments also in Europe.
* Eson Khorgol (Mongolian: &quot;nine balls&quot;), also Eson Xorgol, played by the Kazakh minority in the aimag province of Bayan Ölgii in north-western Mongolia. The game was first described in 1963. 

Although more than 800 names of traditional mancala games are known, some names denote the same game, while others are used for more than one game. Almost 200 modern invented versions have also been described.

== Psychology ==

Like other board games, mancala games have led to psychological studies. Retschitzki has studied the cognitive processes used by awalé players. Some of Restchitzki&#x27;s results on memory and problem solving have recently been simulated by Fernand Gobet with the CHREST computer model. De Voogt has studied the psychology of Bao playing.

== Competition ==

Several groups of Mancala games have their own tournaments. A medley tournament including at least two modalities has been part of the Mind Sports Olympiad, including in the in-person event and the online Grand Prix.

<doc id="20125" wikidata="Q1309" url="?curid=20125" title="Maastricht">
<text>Maastricht ( , , ; ; ; ) is a city and a municipality in the southeastern Netherlands. It is the capital and largest city of the province of Limburg. Maastricht is located on both sides of the Meuse (), at the point where the river is joined by the Jeker. Mount Saint Peter (&quot;Sint-Pietersberg&quot;) is largely situated within the city&#x27;s municipal borders. Maastricht is adjacent to the border with Belgium and is part of the Meuse-Rhine Euroregion, an international metropolis with a population of about 3.9 million, which includes the nearby German and Belgian cities of Aachen, Liège, and Hasselt.

Maastricht developed from a Roman settlement (&quot;Trajectum ad Mosam&quot;) to a medieval river trade and religious centre. In the 16th century it became a garrison town and in the 19th century an early industrial centre. Today, the city is a thriving cultural and regional hub. It became well known through the Maastricht Treaty and as the birthplace of the euro. Maastricht has 1,677 national heritage buildings (&quot;rijksmonumenten&quot;), the second highest number in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam. The city is visited by tourists for shopping and recreation, and has a large international student population. The last stage of the Cretaceous period and the Mesozoic era, the Maastrichtian, is named after this city, at the end of which was the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which resulted in the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.

== History ==
=== Toponymy ===
Maastricht is mentioned in ancient documents as &quot;[Ad] Treiectinsem [urbem]&quot; ab. 575, &quot;Treiectensis&quot; in 634, &quot;Triecto&quot;, &quot;Triectu&quot; in 7th century, &quot;Triiect&quot; in 768–781, &quot;Traiecto&quot; in 945, &quot;Masetrieth&quot; in 1051.

The place name &quot;Maastricht&quot; is an Old Dutch compound &quot;Masa-&quot; (&gt; &quot;Maas&quot; &quot;the Meuse river&quot;) + Old Dutch &quot;*treiekt&quot;, itself borrowed from Gallo-Romance cf. its Walloon name &quot;li trek&quot;, from Classical Latin &quot;trajectus&quot; (&quot;ford, passage, place to cross a river&quot;) with the later addition of &quot;Maas&quot; &quot;Meuse&quot; to avoid the confusion with the &quot;-trecht&quot; of Utrecht having exactly the same original form and etymology. The Latin name first appears in medieval documents and it is not known whether &quot;&quot; was Maastricht&#x27;s name during Roman times.

A resident of Maastricht is referred to as &quot;Maastrichtenaar&quot; while in the local dialect it is either &quot;Mestreechteneer&quot; or, colloquially, &quot;Sjeng&quot; (derived from the formerly popular French name &quot;Jean&quot;).

=== Early history ===

Neanderthal remains have been found to the west of Maastricht (Belvédère excavations). Of a later date are Palaeolithic remains, between 8,000 and 25,000 years old. Celts lived here around 500 BC, at a spot where the river Meuse was shallow and therefore easy to cross.

It is not known when the Romans arrived in Maastricht, nor whether the settlement was founded by them. The Romans built a bridge across the Meuse in the 1st century AD, during the reign of Augustus Caesar. The bridge was an important link in the main road between Bavay and Cologne. Roman Maastricht was relatively small. Remains of the Roman road, the bridge, a religious shrine, a Roman bath, a granary, some houses and the 4th-century castrum walls and gates, have been excavated. Fragments of provincial Roman sculptures, as well as coins, jewelry, glass, pottery and other objects from Roman Maastricht are on display in the exhibition space of the city&#x27;s public library (&quot;Centre Céramique&quot;).

According to legend, the Armenian-born Saint Servatius, Bishop of Tongeren, died in Maastricht in 384 where he was interred along the Roman road, outside the castrum. According to Gregory of Tours it was bishop Monulph who around 570 built the first stone church on the grave of Servatius, a precursor of the present-day Basilica of Saint Servatius. The city remained an early Christian diocese until it lost the distinction to nearby Liège in the 8th or 9th century.

=== Middle Ages ===
In the early Middle Ages Maastricht, along with Aachen and Liège, formed part of what is considered the heartland of the Carolingian dynasty. At this time, the town was an important centre for river trade and manufacturing. Merovingian coins minted in Maastricht have been found throughout Europe. In 881 the town was plundered by the Vikings. In the 10th century it briefly became the capital of the duchy of Lower Lorraine.

During the 11th and 12th centuries the town flourished culturally. Several provosts of the chapter of Saint Servatius held important positions in the Holy Roman Empire. The two collegiate churches were largely rebuilt and redecorated during this era. Maastricht Romanesque stone sculpture and silversmithing are regarded as highlights of Mosan art. Maastricht painters were praised by Wolfram von Eschenbach in his Parzival. Around the same time, the poet Henric van Veldeke wrote a legend of Saint Servatius, one of the earliest works in Dutch literature. The two main churches acquired a wealth of relics and the septennial Maastricht Pilgrimage became a major event that drew up to 100,000 pilgrims.

Unlike most Dutch towns, Maastricht did not receive city rights at a certain date. These gradually developed during its long history. In 1204 the city&#x27;s dual authority was formalised in a treaty, with the prince-bishop of Liège and the duke of Brabant holding joint sovereignty over the city. Soon afterwards the first ring of medieval walls were built. In 1275, the old Roman bridge collapsed under the weight of a procession, allegedly killing 400 people. A replacement bridge, funded by church indulgences, was built slightly to the north and survives until today, the Sint Servaasbrug.

Throughout the Middle Ages, the city remained a centre for trade and manufacturing principally of wool and leather but gradually economic decline set in. After a brief period of economic prosperity around 1500, the city&#x27;s economy suffered during the wars of religion of the 16th and 17th centuries, and recovery did not happen until the industrial revolution in the early 19th century.

The strategic location of Maastricht at a major river crossing necessitated the construction of an array of fortifications around the city during this period. The Spanish and Dutch garrisons became an important factor in the city&#x27;s economy. In 1579 the city was sacked by the Spanish army led by the Duke of Parma (Siege of Maastricht, 1579). For over fifty years the Spanish crown took over the role previously held by the dukes of Brabant in the joint sovereignty over Maastricht. In 1632 the city was conquered by Prince Frederick Henry of Orange and the Dutch States General replaced the Spanish crown in the joint government of Maastricht. There was an attempt in 1634 of Spanish forces to recapture the city, but to no avail.

Another Siege of Maastricht (1673) took place during the Franco-Dutch War. In June 1673, Louis XIV laid siege to the city because French supply lines were being threatened. During this siege, Vauban, the famous French military engineer, developed a new tactic in order to break down the strong fortifications surrounding Maastricht. His systematic approach remained the standard method of attacking fortresses until the 20th century. On 25 June 1673, while preparing to storm the city, captain-lieutenant Charles de Batz de Castelmore, also known as the &quot;comte d&#x27;Artagnan&quot;, was killed by a musket shot outside the Tongerse Poort. This event was embellished in Alexandre Dumas&#x27; novel &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot;, part of the D&#x27;Artagnan Romances. French troops occupied Maastricht from 1673 to 1678.

In 1748 the French again conquered the city at what is known as the Second French Siege of Maastricht, during the War of Austrian Succession. After each siege the city&#x27;s fortifications were restored and expanded. The French revolutionary army failed to take the city in 1793 but a year later they succeeded. The condominium was dissolved and Maastricht was annexed to the French First Republic, later the First French Empire. For almost twenty years (1795–1814/15) Maastricht was the capital of the French département of Meuse-Inférieure.

=== 19th and early 20th century ===

After the Napoleonic era, Maastricht became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. It was made the capital of the newly formed Province of Limburg (1815–1839). When the southern provinces of the newly formed kingdom seceded in 1830, the Dutch garrison in Maastricht remained loyal to the Dutch king, William I, even when most of the inhabitants of the town and the surrounding area sided with the Belgian revolutionaries. In 1831, arbitration by the Great Powers allocated the city to the Netherlands. However, neither the Dutch nor the Belgians agreed to this and the arrangement was not implemented until the 1839 Treaty of London. During this period of isolation Maastricht developed into an early industrial town.
Because of its eccentric location in the southeastern Netherlands, as well as its geographical and cultural proximity to Belgium and Germany, integration of Maastricht and Limburg into the Netherlands did not come about easily. Maastricht retained a distinctly non-Dutch appearance during much of the 19th century and it was not until the First World War that the city was forced to look northwards.

Like the rest of the Netherlands, Maastricht remained neutral during World War I. However, being wedged between Germany and Belgium, it received large numbers of refugees, putting a strain on the city&#x27;s resources. Early in World War II, the city was taken by the Germans by surprise during the Battle of Maastricht of May 1940. On 13 and 14 September 1944 it was the first Dutch city to be liberated by Allied forces of the US Old Hickory Division. The three Meuse bridges were destroyed or severely damaged during the war. As elsewhere in the Netherlands, the majority of Maastricht Jews died in Nazi concentration camps.

=== After World War II ===

During the latter half of the century, traditional industries (such as Maastricht&#x27;s potteries) declined and the city&#x27;s economy shifted to a service economy. Maastricht University was founded in 1976. Several European institutions found their base in Maastricht. In 1981 and 1991 European Councils were held in Maastricht, the latter one resulting a year later in the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, leading to the creation of the European Union and the euro. Since 1988, The European Fine Art Fair, regarded as the world&#x27;s leading art fair, annually draws in some of the wealthiest art collectors.

Since the 1990s, large parts of the city have been refurbished, including the areas around the main railway station and the Maasboulevard promenade along the Meuse, the Entre Deux and Mosae Forum shopping centres, as well as some of the main shopping streets. A prestigious quarter designed by international architects and including the new Bonnefanten Museum, a public library, and a theatre was built on the grounds of the former Société Céramique factory near the town centre. Further large-scale projects, such as the redevelopment of the area around the A2 motorway, the Sphinx Quarter and the Belvédère area are under construction.

In the early 2000s, Maastricht launched several campaigns against drug-dealing in an attempt to stop foreign buyers taking advantage of the liberal Dutch legislation and causing trouble in the downtown area.

== Geography ==
=== Neighbourhoods ===

Maastricht consists of seven areas (&quot;wijken&quot;) and 44 neighbourhoods (&quot;buurten&quot;). Each area and neighbourhood has a number which corresponds to its CBS code.

# Maastricht Centrum (CBS area code: 093500): Binnenstad, Jekerkwartier, Kommelkwartier, Statenkwartier, Boschstraatkwartier, Sint Maartenspoort, Wyck-Céramique
# South-West (093501): Villapark, Jekerdal, Biesland, Campagne, Wolder, Sint Pieter)
# West (093502): Brusselsepoort, Mariaberg, Belfort, Pottenberg, Malpertuis, Caberg, Malberg, Dousberg-Hazendans, Daalhof
# North-West (093503): Boschpoort, Bosscherveld, Frontenkwartier, Belvédère, Lanakerveld
# North-East (093505): Beatrixhaven, Borgharen, Itteren, Meerssenhoven
# East (093504): Wyckerpoort, Wittevrouwenveld, Nazareth, Limmel, Amby, Scharn, Heugemerveld
# South-East (093506): Randwyck, Heugem, Heer, De Heeg, Vroendaal

Itteren, Borgharen, Limmel, Amby, Heer, Heugem, Scharn, Oud-Caberg, Sint Pieter and Wolder are neighbourhoods that used to be separate municipalities or villages until they were annexed by the city of Maastricht in the course of the 20th century.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===
The outlying areas of the following municipalities are bordering the municipality of Maastricht directly.

&quot;Clockwise from north-east to north-west:&quot;
&quot;(B = Situated in Belgium)&quot;

=== Border ===
Maastricht&#x27;s city limits has an international border with Belgium. Most of it borders Belgium&#x27;s Flemish region, but a small part to the south also has a border with Wallonia. Both countries are part of Europe&#x27;s Schengen Area and, thus, are open without border controls.

=== Climate ===
Maastricht features the same climate as most of the Netherlands (&quot;Cfb&quot;, Oceanic climate), however, due to its more inland location in between hills, summers tend to be warmer (especially in the Meuse valley, which lies lower than the meteorological station) and winters a bit colder, although the difference is only noticeable on just a few days a year. The highest temperature recorded was on 25 July 2019 at .

== Demographics ==

=== Languages ===
Maastricht is a city of linguistic diversity, partly as a result of its location at the crossroads of multiple language areas and its international student population.

* Dutch is the national language and the language of elementary and secondary education (excluding international institutions) as well as administration. Dutch in Maastricht is often spoken with a distinctive Limburgish accent, which should not be confused with the Limburgish language.
* Limburgish (or &quot;Limburgian&quot;) is the overlapping term of the tonal dialects spoken in the Dutch and the Belgian provinces of Limburg. The Maastrichtian dialect (&quot;Mestreechs&quot;) is only one of many variants of Limburgish. It is characterised by stretched vowels and some French influence on its vocabulary. In recent years the Maastricht dialect has been in decline (see dialect levelling) and a language switch to Standard Dutch has been noted.
* French used to be the language of education and culture in Maastricht. In the late 18th century the language gained a powerful position as the judicial and administrative language, and throughout the following century it was the preferred language of the upper classes. Between 1851 and 1892 a Francophone newspaper (&quot;Le Courrier de la Meuse&quot;) was published in Maastricht. The language is often part of secondary school curricula. Many proper names are French and the language has left many traces in the local dialect.
* German, like French, is often part of secondary school curricula. Due to Maastricht&#x27;s geographic proximity to Germany and the great number of German students in the city, German is widely spoken.
* English has become an important language in education. At Maastricht University and Hogeschool Zuyd it is the language of instruction for many courses. Many foreign students and expatriates use English as a lingua franca. English is also a mandatory subject in Dutch secondary schools.

=== Religion ===

In 2010–2014, 69.8% of the population of Maastricht regarded themselves as religious. 60.4% of the total population stated an affiliation with the Roman Catholic Church. 13.9% attended a religious ceremony at least once a month.

== Culture and tourism ==





=== Sights of Maastricht ===
Maastricht is known in the Netherlands and beyond for its lively squares, narrow streets, and historic buildings. The city has 1,677 national heritage buildings (&quot;rijksmonumenten&quot;), more than any Dutch city outside Amsterdam. In addition to that there are 3,500 locally listed buildings (&quot;gemeentelijke monumenten&quot;). The entire city centre is a conservation area (&quot;beschermd stadsgezicht&quot;) and largely traffic-free. The tourist information office (VVV) is located in the basement of Dinghuis, a late-medieval courthouse overlooking Grote Staat.

== Nature ==

=== Parks ===
There are several city parks and recreational areas in Maastricht:
* Stadspark, the main public park in Maastricht, partly 19th-century, with remnants of the medieval city walls, a branch of the Jeker river, a mini-zoo and several public sculptures (e.g. the statue of d&#x27;Artagnan in Aldenhofpark, a 20th-century extension of Stadspark). Other extensions of the park are called Kempland, Henri Hermanspark, Monseigneur Nolenspark and Waldeckpark. From 2014 onwards, the grounds of the former Tapijn military barracks will be gradually added to the park;
* Jekerpark, a new park along the river Jeker, separated from Stadspark by a busy road;
* Frontenpark, a new park west of the city centre, incorporating parts of the fortifications of Maastricht from the 17th to 19th centuries;
* Charles Eykpark, a modern park between the public library and Bonnefanten Museum on the east bank of the Meuse river, designed in the late 1990s by Swedish landscape architect Gunnar Martinsson.
* Griendpark, a modern park on the east bank of the river with an inline-skating and skateboarding course.
* Geusseltpark in eastern Maastricht and J.J. van de Vennepark in western Maastricht, both with elaborate sports facilities.

=== Natural areas ===
* The Meuse river and its green banks in outlying areas. In the northern areas around Itteren and Borgharen &#x27;new nature&#x27; is being created in combination with river protection measures and gravel mining.
* Pietersplas, an artificial lake between Maastricht and Gronsveld that was the result of gravel pits on the banks of the Meuse river. There is a beach on the northern slope of the lake and a marina near Castle Hoogenweerth. The eastern riverbed between Pietersplas and the provincial government building is a nature reserve (Kleine Weerd).
* The Jeker Valley, along the river Jeker, starts near the city centre in Stadspark and leads via Jekerpark to an area with green meadows, fertile fields, some vineyards on the slopes of Cannerberg, several water mills and Château Neercanne, and continues further south into Belgium.
* The green flanks of Mount Saint Peter, including many footpaths. 
* Dousberg and Zouwdal, a modest hill and valley surrounded by urban development on the western edge of the city, partly in Belgium. A large part of the hill is now in use as an international golf course (Golfclub Maastricht).
* Landgoederenzone, an extended area in the northeast of Maastricht (partly in Meerssen) consisting of around fifteen country estates, such as Severen, Geusselt, Bethlehem, Mariënwaard, Kruisdonk, Vaeshartelt, Meerssenhoven, Borgharen and Hartelstein. Some of the castles, villas and stately homes are surrounded by industrial areas or quarries.
* Bike paths through agricultural areas in several outlying quarters (like &quot;Biesland&quot; and &quot;Wolder&quot;).

== Sports ==

* In football, Maastricht is represented by MVV Maastricht (Dutch: &quot;Maatschappelijke Voetbal Vereniging Maastricht&quot;), who (as of the 2016–2017 season) play in the Dutch first division of the national competition (which is the second league after the Eredivisie league). MVV&#x27;s home is the Geusselt stadium near the A2 highway.
* Maastricht is also home to the Maastricht Wildcats, an American Football League team and member of the AFBN (American Football Bond Nederland).
* Since 1998, Maastricht has been the traditional starting place of the annual Amstel Gold Race, the only Dutch cycling classic. For several years the race also finished in Maastricht, but since 2002 the finale has been in the municipality of Valkenburg. Tom Dumoulin was born in Maastricht.
* Since 2000, Maastricht has been the first city in the Netherlands with a Lacrosse team. The Student Sport Association &quot;Maaslax&quot; is closely linked to Maastricht University and a member of the NLB (Nederlandse Lacrosse Bond).

== Politics ==
=== City council ===
The municipal government of Maastricht consists of a city council, a mayor and a number of aldermen. The city council, a 39-member legislative body directly elected every four years, appoints the aldermen on the basis of a coalition agreement between two or more parties after each election.

=== Aldermen and mayors ===
The mayor and aldermen make up the executive branch of the municipal government. 

The mayor from 2002, Gerd Leers (CDA), resigned in January 2010 following allegations of irregularities in a holiday villa project in Bulgaria owned by Leers. He was replaced by Onno Hoes, a Liberal (VVD), the only male mayor in the country officially married to a man. In 2013 Hoes was subject to controversy after disclosures of intimate affairs with several other men, although he remained mayor. After a new affair in 2014, Hoes eventually stepped down.

From July 2015, Annemarie Penn-te Strake became mayor. She was an independent serving no political party, although her husband was a former chairman of the Maastricht Seniorenpartij. She had served in the Dutch judicial system for many years, and during her tenure as mayor she still served as attorney general. In July 2023 Wim Hillenaar (CDA) took over as mayor.

=== Cannabis ===
One controversial issue which dominated Maastricht politics for many years was the city&#x27;s approach to soft drugs. Under the Dutch soft drug policy, individuals may buy cannabis from &#x27;coffeeshops&#x27; under certain conditions. From the 1980s, Maastricht saw a growing influx of &#x27;drug tourists&#x27;, mainly from neighbouring Belgium, France and Germany. The city government attempted to reduce negative side effects, including illegal sale of hard drugs in the city centre and anti-social behaviour.

A 2008 proposal to relocate the coffeeshops to the outskirts of the city was opposed by neighbouring municipalities (some in Belgium) and by the Dutch and Belgian parliaments. In December 2010, a Maastricht law to restrict entry to coffeeshops to local residents was upheld by the Court of Justice of the European Union, with the Dutch government introducing a similar national law in 2012. The new system led to a reduction in drug tourism in Maastricht&#x27;s cannabis shops, but an increase in drug dealing on the streets. A 2018 Maastricht University study showed a substantial decline in drug nuisance since 2012, although criminal drug networks had grown due to police budget cuts.

== Transport ==

=== By bike ===
Maastricht is bikeable. People biking are able to cross the river using every bridge in the city. 

=== By car ===
Maastricht is served by the A2 and A79 motorways. The city can be reached from Brussels and Cologne in approximately one hour and from Amsterdam in about two and a half hours.

The A2 motorway runs through Maastricht in a double-decked tunnel. Before 2016, the A2 motorway ran through the city; heavily congested, it caused air pollution in the urban area. Construction of a two-level tunnel designed to solve these problems started in 2011 and was opened (in stages) by December 2016.

In spite of several large underground car parks, parking in the city centre forms a major problem during weekends and bank holidays because of the large numbers of visitors. Parking fees are deliberately high to encourage visitors to use public transport or park and ride facilities away from the centre.

=== By train ===
Maastricht is served by three rail operators, all of which call at the main Maastricht railway station near the centre and two of which call at the smaller Maastricht Randwyck, near the business and university district. Only Arriva also calls at Maastricht Noord, which opened in 2013. Intercity trains northwards to Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Den Bosch and Utrecht are operated by Dutch Railways. The line to Heerlen, Valkenburg and Kerkrade is operated by Arriva. The National Railway Company of Belgium runs south to Liège in Belgium. The westbound railway to Hasselt (Belgium) closed in 1954. The former railway to Aachen was closed down in the 1980s. However, Aachen can still be reached via Heerlen.

=== By bus ===
Regular bus lines connect the city centre, outer areas, business districts and railway stations. The regional Arriva bus network extends to most parts of South Limburg and Aachen (Germany). Regional buses by De Lijn connect Maastricht with Hasselt, Tongeren and Maasmechelen, and one bus connects Maastricht with Liège, operated by TEC. Various bus companies such as Flixbus and Eurolines provide intercity bus services from Maastricht to many European destinations.

=== By air ===
Maastricht is served by the nearby Maastricht Aachen Airport , in nearby Beek, and it is informally referred to by that name. The airport is located about north of the city centre. The airport is served by Corendon Dutch Airlines and Ryanair which operate scheduled flights to destinations around the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands, North-Africa and also London Stansted Airport from March 2022. There are also charter flights to Lourdes which are operated by Enter Air.

=== By boat ===
Maastricht has a river port (&quot;Beatrixhaven&quot;) and is connected by water with Belgium and the rest of the Netherlands through the river Meuse, the Juliana Canal, the Albert Canal and the Zuid-Willemsvaart. Although there are no regular boat connections to other cities, various organized boat trips for tourists connect Maastricht with Belgium cities such as Liège.

== Local anthem ==
In 2002 the municipal government officially adopted a local anthem (Limburgish (Maastrichtian variant): &quot;Mestreechs Volksleed&quot;, ) composed of lyrics in Maastrichtian, written by Alfons Olterdissen. The theme was originally composed by his brother, Guus Olterdissen, though the theme is similar to the theme &quot;Pe al nostru steag e scris Unire&quot; of the Romanian composer Ciprian Porumbescu (1853–1883). It is unknown if the Olterdissen brothers were aware of the Romanian piece.

<text>Maurits Cornelis Escher (; ; 17 June 1898 – 27 March 1972) was a Dutch graphic artist who made woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints, many of which were inspired by mathematics.
Despite wide popular interest, for most of his life Escher was neglected in the art world, even in his native Netherlands. He was 70 before a retrospective exhibition was held. In the late twentieth century, he became more widely appreciated, and in the twenty-first century he has been celebrated in exhibitions around the world.

His work features mathematical objects and operations including impossible objects, explorations of infinity, reflection, symmetry, perspective, truncated and stellated polyhedra, hyperbolic geometry, and tessellations. Although Escher believed he had no mathematical ability, he interacted with the mathematicians George Pólya, Roger Penrose, and Donald Coxeter, and the crystallographer Friedrich Haag, and conducted his own research into tessellation.

Early in his career, he drew inspiration from nature, making studies of insects, landscapes, and plants such as lichens, all of which he used as details in his artworks. He traveled in Italy and Spain, sketching buildings, townscapes, architecture and the tilings of the Alhambra and the Mezquita of Cordoba, and became steadily more interested in their mathematical structure.

Escher&#x27;s art became well known among scientists and mathematicians, and in popular culture, especially after it was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1966 Mathematical Games column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Apart from being used in a variety of technical papers, his work has appeared on the covers of many books and albums. He was one of the major inspirations for Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning 1979 book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;.

== Early life ==
Maurits Cornelis Escher was born on 17 June 1898 in Leeuwarden, Friesland, the Netherlands, in a house that forms part of the Princessehof Ceramics Museum today. He was the youngest son of the civil engineer George Arnold Escher and his second wife, Sara Gleichman. In 1903, the family moved to Arnhem, where he attended primary and secondary school until 1918. Known to his friends and family as &quot;Mauk&quot;, he was a sickly child and was placed in a special school at the age of seven; he failed the second grade. Although he excelled at drawing, his grades were generally poor. He took carpentry and piano lessons until he was thirteen years old.

In 1918, he went to the Technical College of Delft. From 1919 to 1922, Escher attended the Haarlem School of Architecture and Decorative Arts, learning drawing and the art of making woodcuts. He briefly studied architecture, but he failed a number of subjects (due partly to a persistent skin infection) and switched to decorative arts, studying under the graphic artist Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita.

== Study journeys ==
In 1922, an important year of his life, Escher traveled through Italy, visiting Florence, San Gimignano, Volterra, Siena, and Ravello. In the same year, he traveled through Spain, visiting Madrid, Toledo, and Granada. He was impressed by the Italian countryside and, in Granada, by the Moorish architecture of the fourteenth-century Alhambra. The intricate decorative designs of the Alhambra, based on geometrical symmetries featuring interlocking repetitive patterns in the coloured tiles or sculpted into the walls and ceilings, triggered his interest in the mathematics of tessellation and became a powerful influence on his work.

Escher returned to Italy and lived in Rome from 1923 to 1935. While in Italy, Escher met Jetta Umiker – a Swiss woman, like himself attracted to Italy – whom he married in 1924. The couple settled in Rome where their first son, Giorgio (George) Arnaldo Escher, named after his grandfather, was born. Escher and Jetta later had two more sons – Arthur and Jan.

He travelled frequently, visiting (among other places) Viterbo in 1926, the Abruzzi in 1927 and 1929, Corsica in 1928 and 1933, Calabria in 1930, the Amalfi coast in 1931 and 1934, and Gargano and Sicily in 1932 and 1935. The townscapes and landscapes of these places feature prominently in his artworks. In May and June 1936, Escher travelled back to Spain, revisiting the Alhambra and spending days at a time making detailed drawings of its mosaic patterns. It was here that he became fascinated, to the point of obsession, with tessellation, explaining:

The sketches he made in the Alhambra formed a major source for his work from that time on. He studied the architecture of the Mezquita, the Moorish mosque of Cordoba. This turned out to be the last of his long study journeys; after 1937, his artworks were created in his studio rather than in the field. His art correspondingly changed sharply from being mainly observational, with a strong emphasis on the realistic details of things seen in nature and architecture, to being the product of his geometric analysis and his visual imagination. All the same, even his early work already shows his interest in the nature of space, the unusual, perspective, and multiple points of view.

== Later life ==

In 1935, the political climate in Italy under Mussolini became unacceptable to Escher. He had no interest in politics, finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium, but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy. When his eldest son, George, was forced at the age of nine to wear a Ballila uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to Château-d&#x27;Œx, Switzerland, where they remained for two years.

The Netherlands post office had Escher design a semi-postal stamp for the &quot;Air Fund&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Het Nationaal Luchtvaartfonds&quot;) in 1935, and again in 1949 he designed Dutch stamps. These were for the 75th anniversary of the Universal Postal Union; a different design was used by Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles for the same commemoration.

Escher, who had been very fond of and inspired by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937 the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. World War II forced them to move in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Escher&#x27;s best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold, and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published as part of the book &quot;Escher on Escher&quot;. He was awarded the Knighthood of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1955; in 1967 he was made an Officer.

In July 1969 he finished his last work, a large woodcut with threefold rotational symmetry called &quot;Snakes&quot;, in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings. These shrink to infinity toward both the center and the edge of a circle. It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using three blocks, each rotated three times about the center of the image and precisely aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print. The image encapsulates Escher&#x27;s love of symmetry; of interlocking patterns; and, at the end of his life, of his approach to infinity. The care that Escher took in creating and printing this woodcut can be seen in a video recording.

Escher moved to the Rosa Spier Huis in Laren in 1970, an artists&#x27; retirement home in which he had his own studio. He died in a hospital in Hilversum on 27 March 1972, aged 73. He is buried at the New Cemetery in Baarn.

== Mathematically inspired work ==

Much of Escher&#x27;s work is inescapably mathematical. This has caused a disconnect between his fame among mathematicians and the general public, and the lack of esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world. His originality and mastery of graphic techniques are respected, but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical. Movements such as conceptual art have, to a degree, reversed the art world&#x27;s attitude to intellectuality and lyricism, but this did not rehabilitate Escher, because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective. However, these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public.

Escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes: J. L. Locher, director of the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, points out that Parmigianino (1503–1540) had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his 1524 &quot;Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror&quot;, depicting his own image in a curved mirror, while William Hogarth&#x27;s 1754 &quot;Satire on False Perspective&quot; foreshadows Escher&#x27;s playful exploration of errors in perspective. Another early artistic forerunner is Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720–1778), whose dark &quot;fantastical&quot; prints such as &quot;The Drawbridge&quot; in his &quot;Carceri&quot; (&quot;Prisons&quot;) sequence depict perspectives of complex architecture with many stairs and ramps, peopled by walking figures. Escher greatly admired Piranesi and had several of Piranesi&#x27;s prints hanging in his studio.

Only with 20th century movements such as Cubism, De Stijl, Dadaism, and Surrealism did mainstream art start to explore Escher-like ways of looking at the world with multiple simultaneous viewpoints. However, although Escher had much in common with, for example, Magritte&#x27;s surrealism and Op art, he did not make contact with any of these movements.

=== Tessellation ===

In his early years, Escher sketched landscapes and nature. He sketched insects such as ants, bees, grasshoppers, and mantises, which appeared frequently in his later work. His early love of Roman and Italian landscapes and of nature created an interest in tessellation, which he called &quot;Regular Division of the Plane&quot;; this became the title of his 1958 book, complete with reproductions of a series of woodcuts based on tessellations of the plane, in which he described the systematic buildup of mathematical designs in his artworks. He wrote, &quot;crystallographers have opened the gate leading to an extensive domain&quot;.

After his 1936 journey to the Alhambra and to La Mezquita, Cordoba, where he sketched the Moorish architecture and the tessellated mosaic decorations, Escher began to explore tessellation using geometric grids as the basis for his sketches. He then extended these to form complex interlocking designs, for example with animals such as birds, fish, and reptiles. One of his first attempts at a tessellation was his pencil, India ink, and watercolour &quot;Study of Regular Division of the Plane with Reptiles&quot; (1939), constructed on a hexagonal grid. The heads of the red, green, and white reptiles meet at a vertex; the tails, legs, and sides of the animals interlock exactly. It was used as the basis for his 1943 lithograph &quot;Reptiles&quot;.

His first study of mathematics began with papers by George Pólya and by the crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, sent to him by his brother Berend, a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 canonical wallpaper groups and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of symmetry. From this point on, he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his artworks using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His &quot;Metamorphosis I&quot; (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In &quot;Metamorphosis I&quot;, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece &quot;Metamorphosis III&quot;, which is almost seven metres long.

In 1941 and 1942 Escher summarised his findings for his own artistic use in a sketchbook, which he labeled (following Haag) &quot;Regelmatige vlakverdeling in asymmetrische congruente veelhoeken&quot; (&quot;Regular division of the plane with asymmetric congruent polygons&quot;). The mathematician Doris Schattschneider unequivocally described this notebook as recording &quot;a methodical investigation that can only be termed mathematical research.&quot; She defined the research questions he was following as

=== Geometries ===


Although Escher did not have mathematical training – his understanding of mathematics was largely visual and intuitive – his art had a strong mathematical component, and several of the worlds that he drew were built around impossible objects. After 1924 Escher turned to sketching landscapes in Italy and Corsica with irregular perspectives that are impossible in natural form. His first print of an impossible reality was &quot;Still Life and Street&quot; (1937); impossible stairs and multiple visual and gravitational perspectives feature in popular works such as &quot;Relativity&quot; (1953). &quot;House of Stairs&quot; (1951) attracted the interest of the mathematician Roger Penrose and his father, the biologist Lionel Penrose. In 1956, they published a paper, &quot;Impossible Objects: A Special Type of Visual Illusion&quot; and later sent Escher a copy. Escher replied, admiring the Penroses&#x27; continuously rising flights of steps, and enclosed a print of &quot;Ascending and Descending&quot; (1960). The paper contained the tribar or Penrose triangle, which Escher used repeatedly in his lithograph of a building that appears to function as a perpetual motion machine, &quot;Waterfall&quot; (1961).

Escher was interested enough in Hieronymus Bosch&#x27;s 1500 triptych &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; to re-create part of its right-hand panel, &quot;Hell&quot;, as a lithograph in 1935. He reused the figure of a Mediaeval woman in a two-pointed headdress and a long gown in his lithograph &quot;Belvedere&quot; in 1958; the image is, like many of his other &quot;extraordinary invented places&quot;, peopled with &quot;jesters, , and contemplators&quot;. Thus, Escher not only was interested in possible or impossible geometry but was, in his own words, a &quot;reality enthusiast&quot;; he combined &quot;formal astonishment with a vivid and idiosyncratic vision&quot;.

Escher worked primarily in the media of lithographs and woodcuts, although the few mezzotints he made are considered to be masterpieces of the technique. In his graphic art, he portrayed mathematical relationships among shapes, figures, and space. Integrated into his prints were mirror images of cones, spheres, cubes, rings, and spirals.

Escher was fascinated by mathematical objects such as the Möbius strip, which has only one surface. His wood engraving &quot;Möbius Strip II&quot; (1963) depicts a chain of ants marching forever over what, at any one place, are the two opposite faces of the object—which are seen on inspection to be parts of the strip&#x27;s single surface. In Escher&#x27;s own words:

The mathematical influence in his work became prominent after 1936, when, having boldly asked the Adria Shipping Company if he could sail with them as travelling artist in return for making drawings of their ships, they surprisingly agreed, and he sailed the Mediterranean, becoming interested in order and symmetry. Escher described this journey, including his repeat visit to the Alhambra, as &quot;the richest source of inspiration I have ever tapped&quot;.

Escher&#x27;s interest in curvilinear perspective was encouraged by his friend and &quot;kindred spirit&quot;, the art historian and artist Albert Flocon, in another example of constructive mutual influence. Flocon identified Escher as a &quot;thinking artist&quot; alongside Piero della Francesca, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Wenzel Jamnitzer, Abraham Bosse, Girard Desargues, and Père Nicon. Flocon was delighted by Escher&#x27;s &quot;Grafiek en tekeningen&quot; (&quot;Graphics and Drawings&quot;), which he read in 1959. This stimulated Flocon and André Barre to correspond with Escher and to write the book &quot;La Perspective curviligne&quot; (&quot;Curvilinear perspective&quot;).

=== Platonic and other solids ===
Escher often incorporated three-dimensional objects such as the Platonic solids such as spheres, tetrahedrons, and cubes into his works, as well as mathematical objects such as cylinders and stellated polyhedra. In the print &quot;Reptiles&quot;, he combined two- and three-dimensional images. In one of his papers, Escher emphasized the importance of dimensionality:

Escher&#x27;s artwork is especially well-liked by mathematicians such as Doris Schattschneider and scientists such as Roger Penrose, who enjoy his use of polyhedra and geometric distortions. For example, in &quot;Gravitation&quot;, animals climb around a stellated dodecahedron.

The two towers of &quot;Waterfall&quot; impossible building are topped with compound polyhedra, one a compound of three cubes, the other a stellated rhombic dodecahedron now known as Escher&#x27;s solid. Escher had used this solid in his 1948 woodcut &quot;Stars&quot;, which contains all five of the Platonic solids and various stellated solids, representing stars; the central solid is animated by chameleons climbing through the frame as it whirls in space. Escher possessed a 6 cm refracting telescope and was a keen-enough amateur astronomer to have recorded observations of binary stars.

=== Levels of reality ===
Escher&#x27;s artistic expression was created from images in his mind, rather than directly from observations and travels to other countries. His interest in the multiple levels of reality in art is seen in works such as &quot;Drawing Hands&quot; (1948), where two hands are shown, each drawing the other. The critic Steven Poole commented that

=== Infinity and hyperbolic geometry ===

In 1954 the International Congress of Mathematicians met in Amsterdam, and N. G. de Bruin organised a display of Escher&#x27;s work at the Stedelijk Museum for the participants. Both Roger Penrose and H. S. M. Coxeter were deeply impressed with Escher&#x27;s intuitive grasp of mathematics. Inspired by &quot;Relativity&quot;, Penrose devised his tribar, and his father, Lionel Penrose, devised an endless staircase. Roger Penrose sent sketches of both objects to Escher, and the cycle of invention was closed when Escher then created the perpetual motion machine of &quot;Waterfall&quot; and the endless march of the monk-figures of &quot;Ascending and Descending&quot;.
In 1957 Coxeter obtained Escher&#x27;s permission to use two of his drawings in his paper &quot;Crystal symmetry and its generalizations&quot;. He sent Escher a copy of the paper; Escher recorded that Coxeter&#x27;s figure of a hyperbolic tessellation &quot;gave me quite a shock&quot;: the infinite regular repetition of the tiles in the hyperbolic plane, growing rapidly smaller towards the edge of the circle, was precisely what he wanted to allow him to represent infinity on a two-dimensional plane.

Escher carefully studied Coxeter&#x27;s figure, marking it up to analyse the successively smaller circles with which (he deduced) it had been constructed. He then constructed a diagram, which he sent to Coxeter, showing his analysis; Coxeter confirmed it was correct, but disappointed Escher with his highly technical reply. All the same, Escher persisted with hyperbolic tiling, which he called &quot;Coxetering&quot;. Among the results were the series of wood engravings &quot;Circle Limit I–IV&quot;. In 1959, Coxeter published his finding that these works were extraordinarily accurate: &quot;Escher got it absolutely right to the millimeter&quot;.

== Legacy ==

=== In art collections ===

The Escher intellectual property is controlled by the M.C. Escher Company, while exhibitions of his artworks are managed separately by the M.C. Escher Foundation.

The primary institutional collections of original works by M.C. Escher are the Escher Museum in The Hague; the National Gallery of Art (Washington, DC); the National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa); the Israel Museum (Jerusalem); and the Huis ten Bosch (Nagasaki, Japan).

=== Exhibitions ===

Despite wide popular interest, Escher was for a long time somewhat neglected in the art world; even in his native Netherlands, he was 70 before a retrospective exhibition was held. In the twenty-first century, major exhibitions have been held in cities around the world. An exhibition of his work in Rio de Janeiro attracted more than 573,000 visitors in 2011; its daily visitor count of 9,677 made it the most visited museum exhibition of the year, anywhere in the world. No major exhibition of Escher&#x27;s work was held in Britain until 2015, when the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art ran one in Edinburgh from June to September 2015, moving in October 2015 to the Dulwich Picture Gallery, London. The exhibition poster is based on &quot;Hand with Reflecting Sphere&quot;, 1935, which shows Escher in his house reflected in a handheld sphere, thus illustrating the artist, his interest in levels of reality in art (e.g., is the hand in the foreground more real than the reflected one?), perspective, and spherical geometry. The exhibition moved to Italy in 2015–2016, attracting over 500,000 visitors in Rome and Bologna, and then Milan.

=== In mathematics and science ===

Doris Schattschneider identifies eleven strands of mathematical and scientific research anticipated or directly inspired by Escher. These are the classification of regular tilings using the edge relationships of tiles: two-color and two-motif tilings (counterchange symmetry or antisymmetry); color symmetry (in crystallography); metamorphosis or topological change; covering surfaces with symmetric patterns; Escher&#x27;s algorithm (for generating patterns using decorated squares); creating tile shapes; local versus global definitions of regularity; symmetry of a tiling induced by the symmetry of a tile; orderliness not induced by symmetry groups; the filling of the central void in Escher&#x27;s lithograph &quot;Print Gallery&quot; by H. Lenstra and B. de Smit.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning 1979 book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; by Douglas Hofstadter discusses the ideas of self-reference and strange loops expressed in Escher&#x27;s art. The asteroid 4444 Escher was named in Escher&#x27;s honor in 1985.

=== In popular culture ===

Escher&#x27;s fame in popular culture grew when his work was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1966 &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Escher&#x27;s works have appeared on many album covers including The Scaffold&#x27;s 1969 &quot;L the P&quot; with &quot;Ascending and Descending&quot;; Mott the Hoople&#x27;s eponymous 1969 record with &quot;Reptiles&quot;, Beaver &amp; Krause&#x27;s 1970 &quot;In A Wild Sanctuary&quot; with &quot;Three Worlds&quot;; and Mandrake Memorial&#x27;s 1970 &quot;Puzzle&quot; with &quot;House of Stairs&quot; and (inside) &quot;Curl Up&quot;. His works have similarly been used on many book covers, including some editions of Edwin Abbott&#x27;s &quot;Flatland&quot;, which used &quot;Three Spheres&quot;; E. H. Gombrich&#x27;s &quot;Meditations on a Hobby Horse&quot; with &quot;Horseman&quot;; Pamela Hall&#x27;s &quot;Heads You Lose&quot; with &quot;Plane Filling 1&quot;; Patrick A. Horton&#x27;s &quot;Mastering the Power of Story&quot; with &quot;Drawing Hands&quot;; Erich Gamma et al.&#x27;s &quot;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-oriented software&quot; with &quot;Swans&quot;; and Arthur Markman&#x27;s &quot;Knowledge Representation&quot; with &quot;Reptiles&quot;. The &quot;World of Escher&quot; markets posters, neckties, T-shirts, and jigsaw puzzles of Escher&#x27;s artworks. Both Austria and the Netherlands have issued postage stamps commemorating the artist and his works.

<text>Zheng Shang-Chi, also known as the Master of Kung Fu and Brother Hand, is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Jim Starlin, debuting in &quot;Special Marvel Edition&quot; #15 (December 1973) in the Bronze Age of Comic Books, and starring in his own solo title until 1983. Described as the greatest martial artist alive, Shang-Chi has been trained since birth to be the ultimate fighter with a specialization in various unarmed and weaponry-based &quot;wushu&quot; styles, including the use of the &quot;gùn&quot;, &quot;nunchaku&quot;, and &quot;jian&quot;. Shang-Chi later assumes leadership of the Five Weapons Society and acquires the Ten Rings weapons.

Shang-Chi was spun off from novelist Sax Rohmer&#x27;s licensed property as the unknown son of fictional villain Dr. Fu Manchu. In later editions, his connection to Dr. Fu Manchu was underplayed after Marvel lost the comic book rights to the latter&#x27;s character; to get around this problem, the publisher eventually renamed Shang-Chi&#x27;s father Zheng Zu.

Shang-Chi made his live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021), where he is portrayed by Simu Liu.

==Publication history==
In the early 1970s, writer Steve Englehart and artist Jim Starlin approached DC Comics to adapt the television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot; into a comic book, as DC&#x27;s parent company, Warner Communications, owned the rights to the series. DC Comics, however, was not interested in their pitch, believing the show&#x27;s and the martial arts genre popularity would fade quickly. The duo then approached Marvel Comics with the idea to create a kung fu-focused original comic. Editor-in-chief Roy Thomas agreed, but only if they would include the Sax Rohmer&#x27;s pulp villain Dr. Fu Manchu, as Marvel had previously acquired the comic book rights to the character, and made their protagonist half-white. Englehart and Starlin agreed. They developed Shang-Chi, a master of kung fu, who was introduced as a previously unknown son of Dr. Fu Manchu. Though an original character himself, many of Shang-Chi&#x27;s supporting characters (most notably Dr. Fu Manchu, Sir Denis Nayland Smith, Dr. James Petrie and Fah Lo Suee) were Rohmer creations. Starlin left the series after #17 (replaced by Paul Gulacy) and Englehart after #19 (replaced by Doug Moench). No characters from the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; television series were officially included in the comic series, though in the #19 issue the character Lu Sun bore such a strong resemblance to Kwai Chang Caine that to avoid copyright issues, the character was given a mustache throughout the issue. With artist Paul Gulacy, Shang-Chi&#x27;s visual appearance was modeled after that of Bruce Lee.

According to Englehart, his name was influenced by his study of the I-Ching, composed of 升 (shēng), meaning &quot;ascending&quot;, and chi, meaning vital energy.
Shang-Chi first appeared in &quot;Special Marvel Edition&quot; #15 (December 1973). He appeared again in issue #16, and with issue #17 (April 1974) the publication was retitled &quot;The Hands of Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu&quot;. Amidst the martial arts craze in the United States in the 1970s, the book became very popular, surviving until issue #125 (June 1983), a solid run that included four &quot;Giant-Size&quot; issues and one &quot;Annual&quot;. &quot;Special Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; #1 (1975) cover-titled as &quot;Savage Fists of Kung Fu&quot; reprinted stories from &quot;The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot; #1–2; &quot;The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Special&quot; #1; and &quot;Special Marvel Edition&quot; #15. The character did several crossovers with other Marvel martial artists, including the White Tiger, Iron Fist and the Daughters of the Dragon (Colleen Wing and Misty Knight). He appeared regularly in &quot;The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot;.

Shang-Chi had two more short series: the &quot;Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black&quot; one-shot issue (1990) and the MAX miniseries &quot;Master of Kung Fu: Hellfire Apocalypse&quot; (2002) with artist Paul Gulacy on art again. The character had two stories in the comics anthology series &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;, including one by Moench that ran in the series&#x27; first eight issues in 1988, and co-starred in the &quot;Moon Knight Special&quot; (1992).

In 1995, Shang-Chi would be one of the revival titles produced by Milestone Media, according to writer Dwayne McDuffie, the title would show Shang-Chi using firearms, inspired by gun fu style by Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo; however, according to McDuffie, the proposal was cancelled after the departure of editor-in-chief Tom DeFalco and the death of Mark Gruenwald the following year.

In 1997 a story arc starring Shang-Chi ran in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #514–516, and was intended to lead into a miniseries for the character in 1998.

Although spun out of licensed properties, Shang-Chi is a Marvel-owned character and has been firmly established as a part of the Marvel Universe with guest appearances in numerous other titles, such as &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot;, &quot;Marvel Knights&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;. Most of the original licensed characters in the supporting cast have been either phased out or renamed in the more recent series and stories.

In some of his modern appearances, mention is made of his villainous father either in cryptic terms or using a variety of new names, due to Marvel no longer having the rights to Dr. Fu Manchu. In 2010&#x27;s &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; #6–10, writer Ed Brubaker officially sidestepped the entire issue via a storyline where the Shadow Council resurrects a zombified version of Dr. Fu Manchu, only to discover that &quot;Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; was only an alias and that Shang-Chi&#x27;s father&#x27;s real name was Zheng Zu, an ancient Chinese sorcerer who discovered the secret to immortality. Similarly, Shang-Chi&#x27;s half sister Fah Lo Suee was later renamed Zheng Bao Yu in 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Fearless Defenders&quot; #8, written by Cullen Bunn, while Smith and Petrie have not appeared in any Marvel properties since the end of the &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot; series in 1983.

Shang-Chi returned as a main character in the 2007 &quot;Heroes for Hire&quot; comic book. In 2009, the black and white one-shot &quot;Shang-Chi: Master of Kung&quot; Fu was released, with stories written by Jonathan Hickman, Mike Benson, Charlie Huston and Robin Furth and illustrated by Tomm Coker, C.P. Smith, Enrique Romero and Paul Gulacy.

In 2014, the miniseries &quot;Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot; was released with Shang-Chi in appearance, written by Mike Benson and illustrated by Tan Eng Huat.

In 2015, Shang-Chi starred in the &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot; revival in the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline. Written by Haden Blackman and illustrated by Taljic, the four-issue series is a &quot;wuxia&quot;-inspired story that takes place in the Battleworld domain of K&#x27;un-Lun and centered around Shang-Chi in his fight to overthrow his despotic father, Emperor Zheng Zu.

In 2017, after a 34-year gap, Shang-Chi once again starred in &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot;&#x27;s 126th issue as part of the &quot;Marvel Legacy&quot; relaunch, written by mixed martial artist CM Punk and illustrated by Dalibor Talajic.

In 2020, Shang-Chi starred in a self-titled five issue miniseries written by &quot;American Born Chinese&quot; author Gene Luen Yang with art by Dike Ruan and Philip Tan. Initially set for a June 2020 release, the first issue was delayed to September due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Shang-Chi starred in a new ongoing series by Yang and Ruan in 2021, with Marcus To replacing Ruan by the 9th issue. Following the release of the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021), Yang incorporated several concepts introduced in the movie into the Shang-Chi mythos, including the character Jiang Li as Shang-Chi&#x27;s real mother, who was based on Shang-Chi&#x27;s mother Ying Li, retconning Shang-Chi&#x27;s white American mother and his mixed-race heritage; the heavenly realm Ta-Lo, which was previously introduced by writers Mark Gruenwald, Ralph Macchio and artist Keith Pollard in &quot;Thor&quot; #310 (1980); and the Ten Rings weapons.

In March 2021, the one-shot &quot;The Legend of Shang-Chi&quot; was published, by Alyssa Wong (script) and Andie Tong (art).

In September 2021, Shang-Chi starred in a miniseries made available by the Marvel Unlimited app, the miniseries was written by Alyssa Wong and illustrated by Nathan Stockman.

In July 2022, the ongoing &quot;Shang-Chi&quot; series was succeeded by a new ongoing series titled &quot;Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings&quot;, with the previously solicited &quot;Shang-Chi&quot; #13 being retitled &quot;Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings&quot; #1. 
Yang&#x27;s 24-issue run concluded with the one-shot &quot;Shang-Chi: Master of the Ten Rings&quot;, with Michael YG replacing To on art, in January 2023. In October, he starred in the graphic novel &quot;Shang-Chi and the Quest for Immortality&quot;, which was written and illustrated by Victoria Ying and colored by Ian Herring.

In December 2023, Shang-Chi starred in a &quot;Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot; revival titled &quot;Deadly Hands of Kung Fu: Gang War&quot;, a three issue miniseries written by Greg Pak and illustrated by Caio Majado which was part of the &quot;Gang War&quot; crossover event. In February 2024, Shang-Chi was added to the team lineup for a new &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; series, written by Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing and illustrated by Geraldo Borges. Lanzing explained that Shang-Chi&#x27;s inclusion to the title was due to the character&#x27;s spy thriller roots from the &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot; series.

In September 2024, Shang-Chi was featured as a main character in the limited series &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;, which was written by Steve Orlando and drawn by Cory Smith.

==Fictional character biography==
===&quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot;===

Shang-Chi was born in Henan Province, China, and is the son of Zheng Zu who at the time was using the alias of Dr. Fu Manchu. Shang-Chi was trained from infancy in the martial arts by his father and his tutors. Believing his father was a benevolent humanitarian, Shang-Chi is sent on a mission to London to murder Dr. James Petrie, who his father claimed was a threat to peace. After assassinating Petrie, Shang-Chi encounters Dr. Fu Manchu&#x27;s archenemy Sir Denis Nayland Smith, who tells Shang-Chi his father&#x27;s true nature. Realizing Smith is telling the truth, Shang-Chi escapes from Dr. Fu Manchu&#x27;s Manhattan headquarters, telling his father they are now enemies and vowing to put an end to his evil schemes.

Shang-Chi subsequently fights his adoptive brother Midnight, who was sent by their father to kill Shang-Chi for his defection, and then encounters Smith&#x27;s &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; and MI-6 agent Black Jack Tarr, sent by Smith to apprehend Shang-Chi. After several encounters and coming to trust one another, Shang-Chi becomes an ally of Sir Denis Nayland Smith and MI-6. Together with Smith, Tarr, fellow MI-6 agents Clive Reston and Leiko Wu (his eventual love interest), and Dr. Petrie, Shang-Chi goes on many adventures and missions, usually thwarting his father&#x27;s plans for world domination. Shang-Chi occasionally encounters his half-sister Fah Lo Suee, who leads her own faction of the Si-Fan but opposes her attempts to co-opt him into her own schemes to usurp their father&#x27;s criminal empire.

With Smith, Tarr, Reston, Wu and Petrie, Shang-Chi forms Freelance Restorations, Ltd, an independent spy agency based in Stormhaven Castle, Scotland. After many skirmishes and battles, Shang-Chi witnesses the death of Fu Manchu. Soon after his father&#x27;s death, a guilt-ridden Shang-Chi quits Freelance Restorations, severs all ties with his former allies, forsakes his life as an adventurer, and retires to a village in remote Yang-Tin, China, to live as a fisherman.

===Return===
Some time later, Shang-Chi returns from China and rejoins Tarr, Reston, and Wu. They battle Argus&#x27; terrorist group that aims to cause the United States to act more aggressively against all terrorists. Argus has Wu tortured, cutting off her hand. Shang-Chi and the others rescue Wu, but Shang-Chi imbibes a dose of a slow-acting poison. He is cured by Dr. Fu Manchu&#x27;s elixir vitae.

His father&#x27;s criminal empire split into factions: Sleeping Dragon Clan (led by Chiang Kai-Dong), Steel Lotus Group (led by Hsien Ming-Ho), Wild Tiger Mob (led by Deng Ling-Xiao) and Coiled Serpent Syndicate (led by Mao Liu-Cho). Kingpin takes control of his own faction of the Si-Fan in Hong Kong and provides them cybernetics. Shang-Chi joins forces with the X-Men and Elektra Natchios against the Kingpin&#x27;s Si-Fan.

After collaborating with British Intelligence, Fah Loh Suee was eventually placed as a director of MI-6. Her endeavors perpetually placed her at odds with Shang-Chi and his fellow MI-6 agents. Years later, she once again became involved in the criminal underworld. Now going by the name the Cursed Lotus, she headed a narcotics empire supplying a highly addictive drug, Wild Tiger, with Deng Ling-Xiao and the Wild Tiger, acting as a front for her in Hong Kong. Despite the Wild Tiger Mob being brought down by Shang-Chi, she eludes capture. Shang-Chi never discovers his half-sister&#x27;s involvement.

Fu Manchu eventually resurfaces and employed Zaran (Zhou Man She) to retrieve a chemical from A.I.M. and later directed him to kill Shang-Chi for him. He sent his dacoits to aid Zaran against Shang-Chi and the Marvel Knights. Although they succeeded in destroying the building that Shang-Chi was in, Zaran failed to slay him.

Later retakes control of the Si-Fan but his plot to deploy his Hellfire Weapon is thwarted once again by his son and his allies, at that time it was known as Comte de Saint Germain or Ghost. Shang-Chi have rejoined MI-6, against his father and his previously unknown half-brother Moving Shadow. The mission results in his father&#x27;s Hellfire weapon being destroyed and Moving Shadow&#x27;s death at Dr. Fu Manchu&#x27;s hand for his failure in killing Shang-Chi.

===&quot;Heroes for Hire&quot;===
As a member of the restored Heroes for Hire, Shang-Chi puts his strength of character at the service of their teammates. Humbug, turning against the heroes, tried to double-cross both his friends and the &quot;Earth Hive&quot; of insects, joining the Hive. Shang-Chi refuses to kill Humbug until he finds Humbug has no qualms about torturing the Tarantula if it means less suffering for Colleen. Shang-Chi snaps his neck and leaves with the catatonic Tarantula, ashamed of becoming a soulless murderer.

Still working for MI-6, Shang-Chi collaborates with Pete Wisdom of MI-13 in facing the Welsh dragon, which has become a human crime lord. He becomes the tutor of a young Earth-616 Killraven.

===Heroic Age===
In the &quot;Shadowland&quot; storyline, Shang-Chi is one of the heroes fighting the Hand&#x27;s ninjas. He later works together with Spider-Man against Mister Negative and temporarily takes Mister Negative&#x27;s powers until Shang-Chi is brought back to normal by Spider-Man.

In &quot;Secret Avengers&quot;, Steve Rogers tracks down Shang-Chi to help turn back the Shadow Council, which has partially resurrected Shang-Chi&#x27;s father and employed the Hai-Dai, a squad of assassins, to hunt Shang-Chi down. Beast reveals to Shang-Chi and the Secret Avengers Dr. Fu Manchu is really an ancient sorcerer named Zheng Zu. When Shang-Chi and Rogers meet with John Steele and the Shadow Council for the prisoner exchange, Rogers is overpowered by Steele and Shang-Chi is captured. While Zheng Zu prepares to sacrifice Shang-Chi to complete his resurrection, the Avengers and Moon Knight drop in on him and the Shadow Council. The Prince of Orphans disrupts the ritual, resulting in Zheng Zu&#x27;s death and Shang-Chi&#x27;s rescue. Shang-Chi subsequently joins the Secret Avengers, but leaves the team following the defeat of Arnim Zola 4.2.3. The reveal of Zu&#x27;s true identity results in Fah Lo Suee&#x27;s real identity, Zheng Bao Yu, being revealed as well. Now in full control of the Hai-Dai, Bao Yu resumes her father&#x27;s long-forgotten experiment of bio-engineering Brood eggs as weapons, which she uses to carry out hits in New York&#x27;s Chinatown. The plot is uncovered by Misty Knight and Annabelle Riggs of the Fearless Defenders with help from Elsa Bloodstone; the three track Bao Yu and the Hai-Dai assassins and scientists to an underground laboratory. With the help of No-Name of the Brood, the Fearless Defenders defeat the Hai-Dai and destroy the experiments, forcing Bao Yu to teleport away from her lair.

Per the instructions of the new Madame Web, Shang-Chi is assigned to train Spider-Man in kung fu to compensate for the loss of his spider-sense, which was &#x27;overloaded&#x27; after the wall-crawler had to transmit a strong signal on the same frequency to disable a drone army of Spider-Slayers. Under Shang-Chi&#x27;s tutelage, Spider-Man develops his own martial arts style, the &quot;Way of the Spider&quot;.

During the events of &quot;Spider-Island&quot;, Shang-Chi and other inhabitants of Manhattan are infected by the Spider-Virus, giving him the same powers and abilities as Spider-Man. Shang-Chi is also plagued by recurring nightmares of himself as a spider attacking innocent civilians. People with spider-powers run amok in the city. When he sees Iron Fist and other heroes fighting Spider-Man impostors and Peter Parker nearby, Shang-Chi protects Parker and confirms Spider-Man&#x27;s identity to the other heroes. Meanwhile, the Bride of Nine Spiders attacks and abducts her teammates in the Immortal Weapons. Shang-Chi attempts to stop the Bride of Nine Spiders from abducting Iron Fist with his newly acquired powers, but is unsuccessful.

Shang-Chi learns from Silver Sable that she has found possible locations in Manhattan for the Bride of Nine Spiders&#x27; lair. Although Shang-Chi defeats the Bride of Nine Spiders and frees Iron Fist, he discovers the real culprit: the demon Ai Apaec, who seeks to feed off the Immortal Weapons. Shang-Chi fights Ai Apeac and mutates into a spider during the battle as a result of his infection, but Iron Fist uses his chi force to cure Shang-Chi. After making sure Iron Fist and the rest of the Immortal Weapons are evacuated, Shang-Chi collapses the mansion hideout on Ai Apeac, leaving him immobilized for the Avengers to put back into custody. Shang-Chi and the Immortal Weapons arrive to join the heroes during the final stand against the Spider Queen.

===Marvel NOW!===
During the Marvel NOW! relaunch, Shang-Chi joins the Avengers after being recruited by Captain America and Iron Man.

During the events of &quot;Infinity&quot;, Shang-Chi and the Avengers join the Galactic Council to fight against the Builders and their crusade against all life in the universe. When several allies were captured by the enemy, Shang forms a rescue team with the Black Widow, Spider-Woman and Manifold. Wielding a pair of energy projecting gauntlets, Shang&#x27;s timely intervention prevented his friends from being vaporized by an Aleph. After the Builders&#x27; defeat, the Avengers return to Earth with their new Galactic Council allies to face off against an even bigger threat back home – Thanos. Shang is sent along with the Black Widow and Manifold the infiltrate the Peak and shut down Thanos&#x27; first line of defense; however, the team is intercepted by the Black Dwarf and his guards. As Manifold returned to grab reinforcements, Shang and Natasha managed to defeat the entire security force, save the general who proved to be too much for even the Master of Kung Fu. The combined might of Gladiator, Ronan the Accuser and other Council members eventually made short work of the Black Dwarf and allows Shang and the infiltration team to complete their mission.

With the threat of both the Builders and Thanos thwarted, Shang-Chi is sent to Madripoor along with the Black Widow, the Falcon, and Wolverine to stop a full-scale riot that has broken throughout out the island nation. Shang-Chi infiltrates a temple housed by the Hand but is too late to stop the Hand&#x27;s new leader, the Gorgon, from completing a ritual which raises the island out of the water up upon the head of a massive dragon. When the dragon begins to take flight, Shang-Chi quickly takes out all of the present Hand ninjas at the temple and challenges the Gorgon. Despite a valiant effort, Shang-Chi is defeated by the Gorgon, who throws Shang-Chi from the edge of the dragon&#x27;s head several hundred feet above the ground. Shang-Chi is rescued by the Chinese intelligence-gathering agency S.P.E.A.R and is taken to their air-bound base, the Circle, to recuperate. Shang-Chi, along with the Avengers and S.P.E.A.R.&#x27;s superhuman response team the Ascendants, go to Shanghai to defend the city from the dragon and the Hand&#x27;s forces. Using Pym Particles supplied to him by S.P.E.A.R. director Xian Zheng, Shang Chi grows to the size of a giant and defeats the dragon in combat, but not before enacting payback by tearing off the Hand&#x27;s temple (with a screaming Gorgon still trapped inside) from the dragon&#x27;s head and throwing it several miles away.

When the Illuminati were exposed to have tampered with the mind of Captain America and attempting to destroy worlds threatening Earth as part of the Incursions as seen in the &quot;Time Runs Out&quot; storyline, Shang-Chi joined a faction of the Avengers led by Sunspot. Sunspot&#x27;s Avengers, having taken control over A.I.M., discovered that &quot;Incursion points&quot; (points where an Incursion world that is about to hit Earth can be seen) were causing a massive number of physical mutations among those who stumbled upon the locations. Sending Shang-Chi to an Incursion point in Japan, Shang-Chi was exposed to cosmic-level radiation that transformed Shang-Chi into a mutate capable of creating duplicates of himself.

After capturing Crossbones for a mission, Shang-Chi is informed by Captain America about his former lover Leiko Wu&#x27;s murder at the hands of Razor Fist while working undercover for MI-6 in one of London&#x27;s triads. Shang-Chi travels to London for Leiko&#x27;s funeral and while wondering around Chinatown, he is attacked by unknown assailants, one whom reveals that the crime lord the White Dragon was behind the murder. Shang-Chi is approached by triad clan leader and former enemy Skull-Crusher who offers him a truce; Chao Sima alleges he and Leiko became lovers while she was working undercover and had planned to defect from MI-6 for him. With help from Skull-Crusher and the newly arrived Daughters of the Dragon and the Sons of the Tiger, Shang-Chi confirms that Razor Fist was hired by the White Dragon to kill Leiko due to her involvement with his rival Skull-Crusher and discovers that the White Dragon has access to Mao Shan Pai, a powerful Chinese black magic. Shang-Chi and Skull-Crusher infiltrate the White Dragon&#x27;s estate, where they discover a room displaying the severed heads of missing triad leaders. The two of them fight the White Dragon but are captured by Shang-Chi&#x27;s brother, Midnight Sun, who reveals himself to be the true mastermind behind the White Dragon. With the Mao Shan Pai spellbook taken by the White Dragon&#x27;s men, M&#x27;Nai plans to use its magic to give him power and influence over the triad clans, finally fulfilling Zheng Zu&#x27;s legacy. Needing the heads of the clan leaders in order to complete the ritual, Midnight Sun beheads the White Dragon and Skull-Crusher and proceeds to cast the spell. Instead of giving him power, the spell resurrects Leiko from Chao&#x27;s spilled blood. Since Skull-Crusher made her the leader of his clan before her death, Chao&#x27;s death violated the ritual and resurrected Leiko to punish Midnight Sun. Shang-Chi is able to knock out Midnight Sun during their fight while Leiko brutally maims Razor Fist. Leiko uses her newfound powers to summon the dead spirits of Skull-Crusher, the White Dragon and the other dead triad leaders, who drag Midnight Sun into their realm. When Leiko attempts to execute Razor Fist, Shang-Chi pleads with his former lover to stop; while he is able to get Leiko to spare Razor Fist, he is unable to bring her back to her normal self. Black Jack Tarr (now director of MI-6) and his men raid the estate; Razor Fist and the White Dragon&#x27;s men are arrested while Leiko escapes. Before leaving London, Shang-Chi leaves a photo of him and Leiko at her grave, which is later taken by Leiko after he leaves.

===&quot;The Protectors&quot;===
Shang-Chi joins several other Asian American superheroes (the Hulk (Amadeus Cho), Silk, Ms. Marvel, Jimmy Woo, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jake Oh) for a fundraiser in Flushing, Queens. Later, while the group is spending the night out in Koreatown, Manhattan, they are ambushed by the alien Prince Regent Phalkan and his small army from Seknarf Seven. Shang-Chi and his allies briefly fight off the invaders before they and a large group of bystanders are teleported near Seknarf Seven, where Phalkan demands that the group offer a few people for food within a time limit. Dubbing their group &quot;the Protectors&quot;, Woo rallies the group and bystanders into working together to escape, while Shang-Chi leads an attack with Silk and Ms. Marvel. The Protectors are eventually able to free themselves and defeat Phalkan and his forces with the help of the bystanders. The Alpha Flight Space Program arrives to rescue the Protectors and bystanders and arrest Phalkan, who Sasquatch reveals was exiled from Seknarf Seven for treason.

===&quot;Secret Empire&quot;===
During the 2017 &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Shang-Chi is found to have been a prisoner of HYDRA in Madripoor following HYDRA&#x27;s takeover of the United States. After the Hive and the Gorgon are defeated, the Tony Stark A.I. finds him and he states that he does not have the Cosmic Cube shard anymore. A flashback revealed that Emma Frost took the Cosmic Cube shard from him when he was unconscious. Shang-Chi was later seen with the Underground when they and other American superheroes are fighting HYDRA&#x27;s forces in Washington, D.C.

===&quot;Domino&quot;===
Seeking a way to fight her ability-stealing adversary Topaz, Domino approaches Shang-Chi (who was referred to her by his Protectors teammate Amadeus Cho) at his retreat in Lantau Island for training. After a long training session, the two spend a romantic night out in Hong Kong, only to be ambushed at a night club by a large group of Shang-Chi&#x27;s enemies, led by Midnight Sun and including Razor Fist, Shen Kuei, Shockwave, Death-Hand, Shadow Stalker, Tiger-Claw and others. Domino and Shang-Chi defeat them with relative ease. The two are eventually confronted by Topaz who Domino defeats using Shang-Chi&#x27;s teachings. Despite Shang-Chi&#x27;s pleas for mercy, Domino kills Topaz. Disappointed, Shang-Chi breaks up with Domino and dismisses her as his student.

===&quot;War of the Realms&quot;===
In &quot;The War of the Realms&quot; storyline, after taking part in a demonstration for Jimmy Woo&#x27;s Pan-Asian School for the Unusually Gifted in Mumbai, Shang-Chi and the Protectors are offered membership to Woo&#x27;s Agents of Atlas. Shang-Chi and the others are suddenly alerted by the news of Malekith&#x27;s invasion of Earth; most of the New Agents of Atlas head to Seoul while Ms. Marvel joins Jake Oh and the Champions in New York. Shang-Chi and the others defend Seoul from Malekith&#x27;s ally Queen Sindr and her Fire Goblin forces from Muspelheim with help from the Korean heroes White Fox, Crescent, Io and Luna Snow. After Sindr threatens to summon a volcano in the middle of the city and kill millions of innocents, Brawn teleports Atlas and their new allies away from the battle, allowing Sindr to peacefully annex South Korea. Brawn eventually summons the Chinese heroes the Sword Master and Aero, Filipina heroine Wave, and the Hawaiian Goddess of Fire and Volcanoes Pele from Shanghai to help assist in the fight against Sindr. The newly summoned heroes are less than pleased for being taken out of their previous battle, but Pele quickly puts a stop to the infighting, warning the group that Sindr plans to melt the polar ice caps if they do not work together. After formulating a plan, Brawn confronts Sindr and her forces directly while Aero, Wave and Luna use Sindr&#x27;s Black Bifrost to travel to the Arctic to decrease its temperature; Shang-Chi and the others are teleported to Atlas&#x27; ally the Monkey King of the Ascendants in Northern China where Shang-Chi begins training the remaining members for their final fight. As planned by Brawn, the Queen of Cinders arrives in Northern China with a captured Brawn, only to be taken by surprise by Shang-Chi and the others, who defeat Sindr with Shang-Chi&#x27;s training, although Pele (who is revealed to have been M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced Atlas android) and the Monkey King sacrifice themselves in the process. Despite given the chance to surrender, Sindr flees using the Black Bifrost, only for Shang-Chi and the others to follow her with Brawn&#x27;s teleporter, where they help Captain Marvel defeat her and her remaining forces at the Great Wall of China near Beijing. Shang-Chi is later shown fighting the remaining Fire Goblins alongside Wolverine, Hawkeye, and the Warriors Three in Shanghai. After Malekith&#x27;s defeat, Shang-Chi is seen with the other Agents in Shanghai looking on while the captured Fire Goblins are escorted back to Muspelheim.

===New Agents of Atlas===
Shortly after the &quot;War of the Realms&quot; storyline, Shang-Chi encounters the Sword Master in New York City, who is searching for his missing father. Noticing the upstart hero&#x27;s inexperience and recklessness, Shang takes Lin Lie under his wing to improve his skills. While Shang-Chi and the Sword Master are continuing their training in Flushing, they are interrupted when white lights begin engulfing the city. The two, who are reunited with the other Atlas agents and Giant-Man discover the cities they were in (along with other Asian, Pacific and predominantly Asian cities outside of Asia) have been merged and connected together with portals. Tech mogul Mike Nguyen of the Big Nguyen Company reveals himself to be behind the newly merged city, &quot;Pan&quot;, which he states for 24 hours would allow every citizen to easily explore each other&#x27;s respective cities without any political and economic restrictions.

Sometime later, Shang-Chi and the Sword Master are confronted by Ares, who attempts to take Lin Lie&#x27;s Fuxi sword. Shang-Chi makes a compromise to Ares: in exchange for Shang-Chi and the Sword Master helping him, Ares would help find Lin Lie&#x27;s missing father. Ares accepts, explaining that his drakon son Ismenios had been abducted and that he wished to use the sword to kill Ismenios&#x27; kidnapper, who Ares believes to be another god. Using Pan Portals, the three are able to track Ismenios to a temple in Madripoor, where they encounter Davi Naka, the Mother Goddess of Madripoor. Naka reveals that Ismenios attempted to plunder Atlantis&#x27;s treasure hoard during the absence of its sea serpent guardian, but was caught by Namor. Due to her duty to protect all dragons, Naka rescued Ismenios from Namor&#x27;s wrath and imprisoned the young drakon in her temple for his protection and to placate the king. Naka further warns the group that despite her efforts, Namor is still outraged over the disappearance of his dragon and implores them to find her.

Amadeus later approaches Shang-Chi and tasks him with locating Jimmy Woo, who has not contacted the team since Pan&#x27;s creation. Along with Crescent, Shang-Chi infiltrates Woo&#x27;s office in the Pan-Asian School for the Unusually Gifted in the Mumbai sector of Pan, where he discovers a photograph of Woo and Nguyen together. Shang-Chi and Crescent discover a secret tunnel in Woo&#x27;s office that takes them to the Atlas Foundation&#x27;s headquarters in the Pan sector of San Francisco, where they confront Woo and the Atlas Foundation&#x27;s dragon adviser Mr. Lao, who introduces himself to the Atlas agents. Concurrently, the other Agents find Atlantis&#x27; missing sea serpent imprisoned in Nguyen&#x27;s personal tower, where her magical scales are being harvested to power Pan&#x27;s portals. Woo and Lao order the team to immediately release her while Nguyen argues that doing so would disrupt Pan&#x27;s portals. Before a decision can be made, Namor emerges from the waters off of Pan&#x27;s coast to reclaim his stolen dragon, kickstarting a war between Pan and Atlantis.

===&quot;Atlantis Attacks&quot;===
In the 2020 &quot;Atlantis Attacks&quot; storyline, Shang-Chi and the other New Agents of Atlas are summoned by Brawn during his confrontation with Namor. Namor warns the group to return Atlantis&#x27; dragon in a day or else face the wrath of Atlantis before retreating. After the skirmish, Shang-Chi and the other New Agents are introduced to the original Agents of Atlas by Woo. When Woo sends Namora, Venus, Aero and Wave to Atlantis for a diplomatic mission, Brawn discretely orders Shang-Chi and the Sword Master to spy on Namora, due to her familial ties with Namor. The dragon is eventually released from captivity, but upon arriving home she unexpectedly goes berserk and attacks the underwater kingdom. Witnessing the destruction caused by the dragon, Shang-Chi relays to Amadeus that Atlantis&#x27; scientists discovered an implant embedded in the dragon&#x27;s scales to be the source of her behavior and that Namor believes Amadeus to be behind the sabotage, prompting the king to resume his attack on Pan. When Amadeus is forcibly transformed into the Hulk and put under Nguyen&#x27;s control with Sirena tech in a last ditch effort to destroy Atlantis, Shang-Chi is able to remove the device from Amadeus, freeing him from Nguyen&#x27;s control and reverting him back into Brawn. After the conflict, Shang-Chi admonishes Woo for using the team as his pawns and subsequently quits.

===&quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;===
Yearning for an ordinary life, Shang-Chi relocates to San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown but crosses paths with Leiko, who had rejoined MI-6. When Leiko informs him that his father&#x27;s organization might be active again, they are attacked by unknown assailants but are rescued by Brother Sabre and Sister Dagger, who reveal themselves to be Shang-Chi&#x27;s half-siblings. The two reveal to Shang-Chi that he has been chosen by Zheng Zu&#x27;s spirit as the next Supreme Commander of the Five Weapons Society, a secret organization created by their father centuries ago, the society has used various names over the years such as Si-Fan, Golden Dawn and Hai-Dai; it is also revealed to Shang-Chi that the Honan retreat he was raised in was the House of the Deadly Hand, one of the Society&#x27;s five houses, and that he was its designated champion, Brother Hand. Sabre and Dagger ask their half-brother to return to their family and reclaim his rightful place as leader of the Society from its illegitimate leader Sister Hammer, who usurped control from the previous Commander, Brother Staff, and sent Staff&#x27;s Warriors to kill Shang-Chi to consolidate her rule. Realizing that Hammer is his long-lost full sister, Shi-Hua, Shang-Chi vows to save her from his father&#x27;s cult.

Shang-Chi arrives at the House of the Deadly Staff in London, where he and Shi-Hua surprisingly have a tearful reunion. Shi-Hua explains to Shang-Chi the history of the Five Weapons Society and its five houses, which had gone through many names, including the Si-Fan, the Golden Dawn and Hai Dai; Shi-Hua reveals that she had been sent to the House of the Deadly Hammer in Russia as its Champion following their separation. Shang-Chi reveals the truth of their father&#x27;s nature and attempts to convince Shi-Hua to leave the Society, but is rebuked. Mistakenly believing that Shang-Chi murdered Zheng Zu, Shi-Hua is outraged that their father&#x27;s spirit would choose Shang-Chi over her to succeed him and reveals that she can only be legitimized as the Society&#x27;s Supreme Commander by killing Shang-Chi. Shang-Chi realizes that his sister had poisoned him and begins to succumb to its effects. Instead of dying, Shang-Chi awakens in one of the House&#x27;s laboratory, whose panicked scientists unleash a swarm of jiangshi to kill him. Shang-Chi is grievously wounded by a jiangshi and, before losing consciousness, he is rescued by Sabre and Dagger. While recuperating at the House of the Deadly Dagger in France, Shang-Chi is provided with a new ceremonial uniform and trains with Sabre and Dagger (who reveal their birth names to be Takeshi and Esme, respectively, to him) to prepare against Shi-Hua&#x27;s jiangshi, which are powered by spirit energy and an &quot;unavenged grievance&quot;. Shang-Chi notices that his wound has begun turning his flesh to resemble a jiangshi&#x27;s, making him realize that he is slowly turning into one. A dilapidated spirit beckons Shang-Chi to the House&#x27;s shrine room. Believing him to be his father, Shang-Chi uncovers a shrine dedicated to Zheng Zu&#x27;s younger brother, Zheng Yi, and a mysterious map. The spirit reveals himself to be Yi and disappears before explaining anything else.

Guided by the map, Shang-Chi and his siblings are directed to Yi&#x27;s tomb in Henan, where Yi&#x27;s spirit appears to him in full flesh. Shang-Chi requests Yi&#x27;s guidance in stopping Shi-Hua and her jiangshi and to heal his festering wound inflicted by the jiangshi. Instead, Yi&#x27;s spirit tells Shang-Chi to stop running away from his family, otherwise he would lose his way like his father and that his wounds would lead to something greater. Yi also reveals that Zu did not steal his life essence for immortality, but willingly gave it when Zu tried to save him from dying.

When Shi-Hua and her jiangshi army attack London, Shang-Chi and his siblings arrive as back-up for Leiko and MI-6, providing them with paper amulets to purify the jiangshi. Shang-Chi begins to succumb to his wound and partially transforms into a jiangshi, allowing Shi-Hua to control his body to attack Takeshi and Esme. When Shang-Chi starts resisting, Shi-Hua plants a microchip containing her unavenged grievance on him to put him under her complete control. Instead of resisting, Shang-Chi calms himself, which transports the two to an astral plane where they witness memories of Shi-Hua&#x27;s harsh upbringing by their father at the House of the Deadly Hand in Russia. Realizing that her anger is at Zheng Zu rather than Shang-Chi, Shi-Hua stops her assault, causing the jiangshi to collapse and Shang-Chi&#x27;s wounds to heal. However, Shi-Hua blames Shang-Chi for robbing her of her life&#x27;s purpose and flees before Leiko can apprehend her. On the day of the Lunar New Year, Shang-Chi is named the new Supreme Commander of the Five Weapons Society and with Takeshi and Esme at his side, Shang-Chi vows to keep the Society free of Zheng Zu&#x27;s influence and to use it to protect all humankind. After the ceremony, Shang-Chi is visited by Zheng Zu&#x27;s spirit, who congratulates him and comments that he is destined to become like him, unsettling Shang-Chi.

=== &quot;The Equinox Blade&quot; ===
While Shang-Chi is still in London, Leiko approaches him on behalf of MI-6 and asks him to steal the mystical Equinox Blade from the British Museum before it could be auctioned off due to the danger the sword poses . Leiko guides Shang-Chi via earpiece through the museum&#x27;s security systems, but he encounters Lady Deathstrike, who had just stolen the blade and used its power to steal the souls of the museum&#x27;s guards. After a prolonged struggle and with Leiko&#x27;s help, Shang-Chi knocks Deathstrike out of a window and destroys the blade, freeing the souls it consumed to return to its victims. For his trouble, Leiko treats Shang-Chi to gelato.

=== &quot;Project Gelsemium&quot; ===
Shortly after taking control of the Five Weapons Society, Shang-Chi and Leiko spend vacation together in Seoul, where they witness several gas bombs detonate across the city, turning victims into trees. After helping White Fox rescue civilians from a gas explosion, they receive a broadcast of similar explosions happening in major cities worldwide. The three track the origin of one of the diffusors to an A.I.M. laboratory in London to, where they encounter scientist Jessa Chen, who claims she and other scientists are being forced against their will to create the bioweapon, named the Gelsemium Molecule. Leiko takes Chen to safety while Shang-Chi and White Fox fight A.I.M. guards; however Chen reveals herself as Doctor Gelsemium, the true mastermind behind the Gelsemium Molecule and uses her tree-like physiology to restrain Leiko before exposing her to a Molecule sample, taking her to a laboratory in the Pacific Northwest. With the helpf of Gelsemium&#x27;s former co-workers who used to work for his father, Shang-Chi and White Fox find Leiko through her tracker and fight Gelsemium. After Gelsemium is defeated, Leiko is cured with an antidote which later supplied to Gelsemium&#x27;s victims around the world.

=== &quot;What Is vs. What If&quot; ===
Shang-Chi encounters the Ruguo Coin and is faced with an alternate version of himself who remained faithful to his father from &quot;What If&quot; #16 (August 1979).

===&quot;Enter the Phoenix&quot;===
During the &quot;Enter the Phoenix&quot; storyline, Shang-Chi is chosen by the Phoenix Force to participate in her tournament alongside many other superheroes and supervillains to decide her next host. Along with the other champions, Shang-Chi is empowered by a spark of the Phoenix&#x27;s cosmic fire and wins his first match against Hyperion, who is unable to control the Phoenix&#x27;s power and immediately surrenders without fighting. For his next match, Shang-Chi is pitted against Captain America, who plans to throw the match and help train Shang-Chi into controlling the Phoenix, as he believes Shang-Chi is the ideal choice for the entity&#x27;s next avatar. Before Shang-Chi can land the final blow, he vows to not use his powers to take another life, causing the Phoenix to intervene and eliminate him from the tournament, giving Captain America the win.

===&quot;Shang-Chi vs. the Marvel Universe&quot;===
As the new Supreme Commander of the Five Weapons Society, Shang-Chi finds himself struggling with balancing his loyalties between the superhero community and his family obligations. Sister Dagger and Brother Sabre become increasingly frustrated with the new direction Shang-Chi has for the Society while his newfound involvement with his father&#x27;s criminal empire puts his superhero allies on edge. After establishing a new House of the Deadly Hand in New York City&#x27;s Chinatown to serve as the Society&#x27;s main headquarters, Shang-Chi is reunited with his exiled mutant half-sister Zheng Zhilan, who rejoins their family as the new Sister Staff, and his biological mother Jiang Li, who had been previously trapped in the Negative Zone for years. After Brother Sabre steals a Cosmic Cube from Captain America without Shang-Chi&#x27;s knowledge to help his former lover Lady Iron Fan escape Captain America&#x27;s custody, the Avengers, Spider-Man and Mister Fantastic confront Shang-Chi and the Society to reclaim the Cube. Shang-Chi realizes the truth when Brother Sabre discreetly uses the Cube&#x27;s power to help Shang-Chi defeat Thor and relinquishes the Cube along with Takeshi as a prisoner to the Avengers. Despite Spider-Man and Jiang Li reassuring him, Shang-Chi&#x27;s relationship with his siblings becomes strained while his former allies remain unconvinced of his conviction. Unbeknownst to Shang-Chi, these events are being orchestrated by Chieftain Xin, an old enemy of Zheng Zu, who conspires with Zhilan, Lady Iron Fan and former Society allies King Wild Man and the Red Dot Collective to bring an end to Shang-Chi&#x27;s rule.

===&quot;Family of Origin&quot; and &quot;Blood and Monsters&quot;===
While spending time with his mother at the New House of the Deadly Hand, Jiang Li reveals her past to Shang-Chi, including her history as a Qilin Rider from the mystical dimension of Ta-Lo and how she met and married his father. Shang-Chi and Jiang Li are ambushed by Zhilan, Red Dot, King Wild Man, Lady Iron Fan and their henchmen; Jiang Li uses her psionic abilities to detect that they are being led by Xin, her father. Zhilan reveals that her betrayal is a ruse and helps Shang-Chi and the Society defeat the would-be assassins. Jiang Li explains to Shang-Chi the circumstances surrounding her disappearance and Xin&#x27;s hatred towards Zu and his bloodline. Unfortunately, the assassins take Jiang Li hostage and escape though a portal created by Xin to Qilin Island. When Shang-Chi proves too difficult to defeat in combat, Xin resorts to creating several &quot;taotie&quot; from Shang-Chi&#x27;s blood to hunt down anyone who possesses the bloodline of Zheng Zu. Shang-Chi rescues Takeshi and Shi-Hua when they are both attacked by &quot;taotie&quot; and the Qilin Riders, respectively, and reconciles with both of them. With all five of the Champions of the Five Weapons Society back together, Shang-Chi and his siblings take a makeshift portal to Ta-Lo to rescue his mother and stop his grandfather. The siblings are confronted by the Jade Emperor&#x27;s guards for trespassing, with the Emperor himself arriving to capture them with his Ten Rings. While imprisoned in the Jade Palace dungeon, Zheng Zu&#x27;s spirit visits Shang-Chi to convince him to take the Ten Rings to stop Xin from destroying their family. Xin, empowered by a &quot;taotie&quot; mask created from Shang-Chi&#x27;s blood and Shi-Hua&#x27;s severed hand, arrives at the dungeon to destroy the Zheng bloodline once and for all. Shang-Chi reluctantly allows his father to guide him to the Jade Emperor&#x27;s vault containing the Ten Rings, donning them to save his siblings from his grandfather. When Shang-Chi tries resisting Zheng Zu&#x27;s influence, Xin is able to take six of the Rings from him and defeats the Champions before heading to the House of the Deadly Hand to join the Qilin Riders in destroying the Society. Shang-Chi and his siblings are protected by the four remaining Rings, which is witnessed by the Jade Emperor, who allows Shang-Chi and the others to leave Ta-Lo to stop Xin on the condition that he returns the Ten Rings. At the House of the Deadly Hand, Shang-Chi fights Xin again but loses the remaining Ten Rings to his grandfather, who then orders the Riders to destroy New York City. With no other option, Shang-Chi gives in to Zu&#x27;s influence, allowing him to reclaim all of the Rings from Xin, unlocking their full power and taking on his father&#x27;s appearance and personality. Shang-Chi then uses the Rings to defeat Xin and all the Qilin Riders. Before a corrupted Shang-Chi can execute Xin, he is talked down by Jiang Li and his siblings, freeing him from Zu&#x27;s influence. Shang-Chi has the Five Weapons Society repair the damage done to the city and tend to wounded civilians, revealing the Society&#x27;s existence and his leadership to the public but restores his superhero allies&#x27; faith in him. Afterwards, Shang-Chi hands Xin and the Ten Rings to the Jade Emperor, who appoints Jiang Li as the new Chieftain of the Qilin Riders, forcing her to stay in Ta-Lo. Shang-Chi&#x27;s siblings go their separate ways but leave on good terms with him. One month after the ordeal, Shang-Chi discovers that the Ten Rings have left Ta-Lo and arrived at the House of the Deadly Hand.

===&quot;Secrets&quot; and &quot;Fool Me Twice&quot;===
Sometime before the Ten Rings return to him, Shang-Chi reunites with Jimmy Woo to take down illegal fighting rings organized by Crossfire, where unwilling participants, particularly those of color, are mentally coerced in fighting each other by Crossfire&#x27;s brainwashing technology. After Crossfire and his brokers apprehended by the two with help from the Agents of Atlas, Five Weapons Society, Champions and Leiko, Shang-Chi and Jimmy reflect on their similar backgrounds and different upbringings before reconciling with each other. Shang-Chi later discovers that the Eyes of the Dragon survived their destruction and were stolen by the Inhuman criminal Kamran. Shang-Chi, Sister Dagger and Sister Staff track down the Eyes to Jersey City, New Jersey, where they prevent Kamran from using the Eyes on Ms. Marvel to sacrifice her life to prolong that of his boss, the Inhuman crimelord Lineage.

===&quot;Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings&quot;===
Unable to access the gateways to Ta-Lo, Shang-Chi has the Ten Rings sealed in a vault within the House of the Deadly Hand. Due to the final battle between Shang-Chi and Xin being televised all over the world, the Ten Rings have become public knowledge, prompting several criminal organizations into attacking the House of the Deadly Hand to claim the Rings, forcing Shang-Chi to don them again to fight them off. Shang-Chi leaves the Rings in another vault while accompanying Leiko in rescuing Clive Reston; Shang-Chi discovers the rescue mission is a ruse orchestrated by MI6 to keep him preoccupied while the Ten Rings are stolen by Black Jack Tarr and his men. When MI6 and MI13 accidentally summon an eldritch parasite called the Wyrm of Desolation with the Ten Rings, Shang-Chi saves them and reacquires the Rings, but not before admonishing his former friends for betraying him. These events are witnessed by the Xian Jinzha and Muzha, who question Shang-Chi&#x27;s worthiness of wielding the Ten Rings, prompting them to host a Game of Rings to find a true Ring Keeper.

Shang-Chi and nine other fighters are summoned to the Meritorious Striving Pagoda in Ta-Lo as participants for the Game of Rings; each player is given one of the Ten Rings and forced to fight against one another in the pagoda, with the winner receiving all Ten Rings. Shang-Chi forms an alliance with Shen Kuei and each are able to claim two Rings apiece before advancing to the pagoda&#x27;s next floor. On the next floor, Shang-Chi and Shen Kuei meet Jinzha and Muzha, who reveal the history of the Ten Rings to them. Shang-Chi and Shen Keui are attacked by Leiko, who had been possessed by a spawn of the Desolation Wyrm and entered the tournament as a contestant. After Shang-Chi frees her from the Wyrmspawn, Leiko apologizes to Shang-Chi for the theft of the Ten Rings and withdraws from the tournament. However, Shen Kuei betrays Shang-Chi and steals Leiko&#x27;s Ring from him as both advance to the final floor of the pagoda. As Shang-Chi and Shen Kuei fight in the final round, Shen Kuei willingly consumes the Wrymspawn to defeat Shang-Chi. Shang-Chi is rescued by the other remaining player, Red Cannon, who reveals herself to be Shi-Hua. Shi-Hua destroys the Wyrmspawn but when she is prevented by Shang-Chi from killing Shen Kuei, she gives her Rings to Shang-Chi and withdraws from the tournament. Shang-Chi pleads with Jinzha and Muzha to heal Shen Kuei; the brothers honor his request and send Shen Kuei back to his home dimension. Shang-Chi is declared winner of the Game of Rings and is congratulated by Jiang Li and the Jade Emperor, who reveal themselves to have orchestrated the Game of Rings to test Shang-Chi&#x27;s worthiness of wielding the Rings. The Emperor warns Shang-Chi of a looming threat to Earth that can only be stopped by a worthy Ring-Keeper on Earth, which was why he entrusted the Ten Rings with Shang-Chi.

During a mission with his siblings to thwart a gang of Zheng Zu&#x27;s loyalists from summoning an earlier version of their father from the past, Shang-Chi is accidentally sent back in time to the First Opium War where he encounters younger versions of Zheng Zu and Zheng Yi and that era&#x27;s Deadly Warriors. Shang-Chi is taken aback by Zu&#x27;s heroic and amiable personality and befriends him. The two work together to apprehend a corrupt constable and part on good terms as Shang-Chi is transported back to the present.

===Gang War===
During the events of &quot;Gang War&quot;, Shang-Chi attends a meeting held by the heads of New York&#x27;s criminal families following the attempted assassination of Tombstone, claiming that he acting in the best interests of the Five Weapons Society. As Tombstone&#x27;s coma has left a power vacuum within the criminal underworld, tensions between rival superpowered gangs escalates to a city-wide gang war; due to the close proximities of their organizations&#x27; territories, Shang-Chi is forced to intervene during a destructive turf war between Mister Negative and Lady Yulan. Struggling between his commitment to New York&#x27;s superheroes, maintaining the loyalty of the Society&#x27;s battle hungry warriors and prioritizing Chinatown&#x27;s safety, Shang-Chi minimalizes Society&#x27;s activities as much as possible in the Gang War. Spider-Man confronts Shang-Chi for his involvement with the other crime lords, but Shang-Chi explains that he is only doing so to protect Chinatown&#x27;s citizens and reassures Spider-Man that he would keep the Society confined to Chinatown. Believing that Shang-Chi&#x27;s actions are weakening the Society, several members led by Captain Feng stage a coup against him, which Shang-Chi easily fights off. However, several of Feng&#x27;s sorcerers trap the Ten Rings within a magic prison, robbing Shang-Chi of his weapons. Hoping to find a way to keep Chinatown safe without the Rings, Shang-Chi sends a message to Mr. Negative, Yulan and Diamondback, requesting they each send their best champion to challenge him in a duel for control of Chinatown. The three crimelords accept the challenge but attend the duel themselves. Shang-Chi easily defeats them but discovers they each had sent decoys in their places while focusing their attention on having their forces destroy each other, which Shang-Chi had planned to happen. While Shang-Chi&#x27;s gambit to pit his biggest rivals against each other while keeping them out of Chinatown succeeds, it creates further destruction throughout the rest of city, prompting Mayor Luke Cage into gathering Spider-Man, Danny Rand, She-Hulk and Tombstone to confront him. Having anticipated this as well that his rivals would eventually team up against him after fighting each other, Shang-Chi manipulates the arriving heroes and villains into fighting each other at the House of the Deadly Hand while tricking Captain Feng and his sorcerers into releasing the Ten Rings, which he then uses to defeat the traitors and villains. With Chinatown safe and the Ten Rings back in his possession, Shang-Chi joins the other heroes in ending the Gang War.

===Thunderbolts===
Shang-Chi is recruited by Bucky Barnes into his new Thunderbolts team to eliminate the Red Skull and his enterprises. Using the codename Gamemaster, Shang-Chi and Barnes travel to Hong Kong to intercept U.S. Agent and American Kaiju, who were tricked by the Red Skull&#x27;s spies within the United States Army into destroying the Skull&#x27;s remaining secret base to cover his escape. When Red Skull remotely forces American Kaiju to go on a rampage in the city, Shang-Chi orders the Five Weapons Society to protect citizens and provides Barnes with the mystical Ring of Kuafu, allowing Barnes to grow into the size of a giant to subdue American Kaiju. Shang-Chi and the Thunderbolts travel to Latveria to attack the Red Skull at his remaining base, which is successful after the team tricks Doctor Doom into attacking and killing the Skull.

===&quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;===
Shang-Chi is one of several heroes recruited by Captain America to part of the Avengers Emergency Response Squad and is deployed on the team&#x27;s first mission to stop Sin from terrorizing Rügen with her new powers; Shang-Chi and his team ultimately succeed. While later investigating a robbery that had been committed in Rügen during the fight against Sin, Shang-Chi is ambushed by the culprit Tiger Snake of the Serpent Society. The two fight to a standstill until Shang-Chi is forced to retreat when Tiger Snake poisons him. After recovering at Avengers Mansion, Shang-Chi reports the encounter with Tiger Snake to Captain America. Realizing that the Serpent Society had been using the crises that the AVENG.E.R.S. had been dealing with as cover for several robberies, Shang-Chi joins Captain America&#x27;s team to confront Tiger Snake and the Serpent Society while they are committing a heist at a mine close to Latveria. They are too late to stop Pit Viper from completing a mysterious substance called the Serpent&#x27;s Tears. Pit Viper attempts to make Shang-Chi his first test subject with the Serpent&#x27;s Tears but Captain America jumps in the way; the Tears transform him into a humanoid snake-like monster. Despite this, the AVENG.E.R.S. reunite and rally together to defeat the Serpent Society, destroy the Serpent&#x27;s Tears and revert Captain America back to human where Shang-Chi defeats Tiger Snake in a rematch.

==Powers and abilities==
Shang-Chi&#x27;s fighting skills are so great that he has been able to beat numerous superhuman opponents. Shang-Chi is classed as an athlete but he is one of the best non-superhumans in martial arts and has dedicated much of his life to the art, being referred to by some as the greatest empty-hand fighter and practitioner of kung fu alive, with even Ares acknowledging him as one of the few mortals who can hold their own against a god without the use of magic. In addition, Shang-Chi has battled superpowered foes like Thing of the Fantastic Four in hand-to-hand combat and proved a formidable opponent. Many of his physical abilities seem to stem from his mastery of chi, which often allows him to surpass physical limitations of normal athletes. He has also demonstrated the ability to dodge and catch bullets from machine guns and sniper rifles, and is able to deflect gunshots with his bracers. Shang-Chi is also highly trained in concentration and meditation, and is an expert in various hand weapons including swords, staffs, kali sticks, nunchaku, and shuriken.

His style is known as the &quot;Way of the Deadly Hand&quot;, due to his training at the House of the Deadly Hand.

Due to his martial arts prowess, Shang-Chi is a highly sought out teacher and has mentored many characters in kung fu and hand-to-hand combat. Some of Shang-Chi&#x27;s most prominent students and sparring partners have included Captain America, Spider-Man, and Wolverine.

He is also very in tune with the chi emitted by all living beings, to the point where he was able to detect the psionically masked Jean Grey by sensing her energy.

During his time with the Avengers, Shang-Chi was given special equipment by Tony Stark. This included a pair of gauntlets that allowed him to focus his chi in ways that increased his strength and a pair of repulsor-powered nunchaku. Even without such equipment, his mastery of ki enables him to challenge powerful foes like the Builders or even gamma mutates.

Originally having no superpowers, Shang-Chi has temporarily gained superpowers on several occasions. During the events of &quot;Spider-Island&quot;, he briefly gained the same powers and abilities as Spider-Man after being infected by the Spider-Virus. After mutating into a giant spider, he was cured of his infection by Iron Fist&#x27;s chi, although at the cost of him losing his spider-powers. In &quot;Avengers World&quot; Shang-Chi briefly used Pym Particles to grow to immense size. Following exposure to the cosmic radiation from the Incursions, Shang-Chi was able to create an unlimited number of duplicates of himself.

Shortly after reuniting with his mother, Shang-Chi discovered that he inherited Jiang Li&#x27;s psionic abilities, allowing him to form psychic bonds with his blood relatives. These bonds allow Shang-Chi to sense their location or feel any pain that is inflicted upon them. Shang-Chi&#x27;s psionic abilities also extend to his dead relatives, allowing him to communicate and interact with the spirits of his deceased uncle and father.

While adventuring in Ta-Lo, Shang-Chi acquired the heavenly Ten Rings from the Jade Emperor, granting him a variety of powers and abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, durability and stamina, as well as allowing him to fly and levitate. Shang-Chi can control the Rings telepathically which can be used in a variety of ways, including launching them as projectiles, utilizing them as platforms for transportation and generating makeshift chains to grab objects and restrain opponents. The Ten Rings can also alter their size, either shrinking down to fit Shang-Chi&#x27;s wrists or enlarge themselves to ensnare a human. When Shang-Chi first wore the Ten Rings, his fear of their power corrupting him allowed Chieftain Xin to take control of the Rings away from him. However, when Shang-Chi gave in to his desire, he was able to reclaim the Ten Rings and unlock their potential, increasing his strength and abilities but giving him a similar likeness and personality of his father. Although Shang-Chi was able to completely fight off his father&#x27;s influence, the Ten Rings still retained their unlocked power and loyalty to him.

==Other versions==

In this continuity, he is the exiled son of Emperor Zheng Zu, Master of the Ten Rings, a ruthless martial arts school that uses mystical powers and techniques based on the powers of the Mandarin&#x27;s ten rings from the mainstream continuity. Shang-Chi is wanted for the murder of Lord Tuan, the master of the Iron Fist school, the main rivals of the Ten Rings school. A drunk vagabond, Shang-Chi is approached by Kitten to help teach her and her group of fellow outcasts who had been exiled from each of their respective schools the techniques of the Ten Rings. Ashamed by his upbringing, Shang-Chi coldly refuses and insults the group, outraging their leader, Callisto, who informs the emperor of Shang-Chi&#x27;s whereabouts. The gang&#x27;s hideout raided by K&#x27;un Lun&#x27;s sheriff and Tuan&#x27;s student Rand-K&#x27;ai, the emperor&#x27;s assassin Red Sai of the Red Hand school and Ten Rings enforcer Laughing Skull but after Laughing Skull kills outcast Cy against Rand-K&#x27;ai&#x27;s orders, Shang-Chi helps the group escape with the Nightbringer technique. A guilt ridden Shang-Chi agrees to take the outcasts as his pupils, dubbing their new school The Lowest Caste. Shang-Chi returns from his exile to represent the Lowest Caste for the tournament held every thirteen years to decide which participating master would be the next ruler of K&#x27;un-Lun. Zu allows Shang-Chi to participate but alters the rules so Shang-Chi would have to defeat every representative before facing him in the Thirteen Chambers. After defeating Namor, Drew, Karnak, Lady Mandarin, Ava, Creed, Spector and T&#x27;Challa in consecutive matches, Shang-Chi encounters Rand-K&#x27;ai and Red Sai in the penultimate match of the Thirteen Chambers. During the fight, Red Sai confesses that Zu had sent her to assassinate his rival Tuan but ultimately failed. To spare his lover and her students from the emperor&#x27;s wrath, Shang-Chi killed Tuan; Zu implicated and exiled his son for the murder to cover his own involvement. After the truth is revealed, Red Sai and Rand-K&#x27;ai let Shang-Chi pass so that he could defeat his father. During the fight between Shang-Chi and Zheng Zu, Zu attempts to kill his son with the Spectral Touch technique, only for the move to pass through him due to Shang-Chi learning Kitten&#x27;s technique to become intangible. Shang-Chi proceeds to use nine of the Ten Ring techniques against his father and ultimately defeats him with The Gorgon&#x27;s Eye, which turns him into stone. With Zu&#x27;s defeat, Shang-Chi becomes the new emperor of K&#x27;un-Lun.

===House of M===
In the alternate timeline of the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline, Shang-Chi never realizes his father&#x27;s evil doings before his death at Magneto&#x27;s hands. This causes him to become consumed with a desire for vengeance. In this reality, Shang-Chi is the head of the Dragons criminal organization, alongside Colleen Wing, the Swordsman, Mantis, Zaran the Weapons Master and Machete. The Dragons later resolved their rivalry against Luke Cage&#x27;s gang, but were eventually captured in a trap created by both the Kingpin&#x27;s assassins and Thunderbird&#x27;s agents. The Dragons and the Wolfpack were freed by Luke Cage, in which Shang-Chi&#x27;s gang join the Avengers in their battle against the Brotherhood.

===Marvel Apes===
In this simian version of the Marvel Universe, Shang-Chi and his father work as a subversive organization, trying to get the local sentients to work in peace and not in animalistic domination. The Avengers (Ape-vengers) murder him for this &#x27;weak-minded&#x27; sentiment.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; continuity, Shang-Chi is turned into a zombie during a multi-hero effort to rescue surviving civilians. In a mid-Manhattan battle, detailed in &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; #23, he and dozens of other zombie-heroes attempt to consume the last batch of humans. These humans are defended by that universe&#x27;s Magneto and the Ultimate Fantastic Four. During a successful rescue attempt, Thing sends Shang-Chi flying through the air with one punch. Shang-Chi is then seen attacking Magneto once again, but he is cut in half by the Master of Magnetism. A different Shang-Chi appears in &quot;Marvel Zombies Return&quot; in an alternate universe where he is unaffected by the zombie outbreak. The zombie Wolverine finds him in an underground fight club, engaging with other infamous martial artists. The flesh-hungry mutant slashes him to death.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; universe, Shang-Chi first appeared in &quot;Ultimate Marvel Team-Up&quot; #15. He is the son of an international crime lord. Trained from birth to become a living weapon, he became the world&#x27;s greatest martial artist and being a noble spirit, he eventually came to renounce his father&#x27;s empire. Seeking to get away from his father&#x27;s reach, he emigrated to New York where he worked as a floor sweeper at Wu&#x27;s Fish Market in Chinatown. Feeling that the denizens of New York&#x27;s Chinatown needed someone to protect them, he and his friend Danny Rand were drawn into the gang war between the Kingpin and Hammerhead after the latter targeted him to win over the Chinatown gangs to his cause. The conflict climaxed when Shang-Chi, Danny Rand, Spider-Man, the Black Cat, the Moon Knight and Elektra ambushed Hammerhead&#x27;s penthouse, where a battle royale ensued. It ended with an unconscious Elektra, Hammerhead and Moon Knight. The gang members were then arrested by the police.

The martial arts warrior disguised himself as a costumed criminal in order to take down the Kingpin. The Kingpin discovered his plan and threatened to kill the hero, but he was rescued by Daredevil, who then recruited him as a part of his team to take down the Kingpin. After the Kingpin&#x27;s identity is leaked to the New York Police Department, Shang-Chi and the team disbanded and went their separate ways.

===Earth-13584===
In A.I.M.&#x27;s pocket dimension of Earth-13584, Shang-Chi appears as a member of Spider-Man&#x27;s gang.

==In other media==
===Film===
According to Margaret Loesch, former president and CEO of Marvel Productions, in the 1980s Stan Lee considered Brandon Lee for the role of Shang-Chi and met with the actor and his mother Linda Lee to discuss a potential movie or television series starring the character. In 2001, Stephen Norrington announced his intentions to direct a Shang-Chi film entitled &quot;The Hands of Shang-Chi&quot;. By 2003, the film was in development at DreamWorks Pictures with Yuen Woo-Ping replacing Norrington as director and Bruce C. McKenna hired to write the screenplay. Ang Lee joined the project as a producer in 2004, but the film did not materialize after that point and the rights to the character reverted to Marvel. In 2006, Shang-Chi was chosen as one of the many properties in Marvel Studios&#x27; new film deal with Paramount Pictures.

<text>Marv Albert (born Marvin Philip Aufrichtig; June 12, 1941) is an American former sportscaster. Honored for his work by the Basketball Hall of Fame, he was commonly referred to as &quot;the voice of basketball&quot;. From 1967 to 2004, he was also known as &quot;the voice of the New York Knicks&quot;. Albert was best known nationally for his work as the lead announcer for both the NBA on NBC and NBA games on TNT. In 2015, he was inducted into the Broadcasting Hall of Fame.

In addition to working extensively in both professional and college basketball, he has experience calling a variety of other sports, such as American football, ice hockey, horse racing, boxing, and tennis. Albert has called the play-by-play of eight Super Bowls, nine NBA Finals, and seven Stanley Cup Finals. He has also called the Wimbledon Tennis Championships for TNT with Jim Courier and Mary Carillo and has worked as a co-host and reporter for two World Series (1986 and 1988).

Albert hails from a family of broadcasters. His brothers, Al and Steve Albert, and a son, Kenny, are also play-by-play sports commentators.

==Early life==
Albert was born in Brooklyn, New York City, where he went to Abraham Lincoln High School. His family members owned a grocery store on Brighton Beach Avenue between 3rd and 4th Streets known as Aufrichtig. He attended Syracuse University&#x27;s Newhouse School of Public Communications from 1960 through 1963. In 1962, he served as the voice of the AAA Syracuse Chiefs. He graduated from New York University in 1965.

==Broadcasting career==

===National Basketball Association===
After getting his start by being a ball boy for the New York Knicks, Albert worked his first Knicks game as a broadcaster on January 27, 1963, on WCBS Radio. He was filling in for his mentor, Marty Glickman, who was away in Europe. The game was against the Celtics at the Boston Garden. Beginning in 1967 and lasting 37 years, Albert served as the voice of the New York Knicks on radio and television before being let go by James L. Dolan, the chairman of the MSG Network and Cablevision, after Albert criticized the team&#x27;s poor play on-air in 2004. It was said that Albert&#x27;s high salary was also a factor. His son, Kenny Albert, has been a part-time play-by-play announcer for the Knicks since 2009, filling in whenever the elder Albert&#x27;s successor, Mike Breen, is unavailable.

====NBC Sports====
Albert was the lead play-by-play announcer for the &quot;NBA on NBC&quot; for most of its run from 1990 to 2002, calling every NBA Finals during that timeframe except for 1998, 1999, and 2000, which were called by Bob Costas in the wake of Albert&#x27;s arrest for sexual assault. Albert resumed his previous position for the 2000–2001 season and called Game 4 of the 2002 NBA Finals, which was the final NBA telecast on NBC. During his time on NBC, he continued as the lead play-by-play man for the New York Knicks on local MSG Network telecasts and began calling national games for TNT in 1999, as well. When he regained the lead broadcaster position on NBC, he continued to call play-by-play for both networks until the end of NBC&#x27;s coverage in 2002.

====TNT====
Albert continued to be the lead play-by-play announcer for National Basketball Association games on TNT, a position he assumed in 1999. Indeed, TNT had become his primary commitment ever since his longtime employer NBC lost the NBA broadcasting rights in 2002 to ABC and ESPN, which may have played a role in his departure from the Knicks&#x27; broadcast booth. The Knicks reportedly wanted Albert to accept a salary commensurate with his reduced Knicks schedule but also weren&#x27;t happy about Albert making what Knicks management felt were overly critical comments about their team despite their losing record.

In basketball, his most famous call is his simple &quot;Yes!&quot; for a basket, rendered in many variations of volume and length depending on the situation.

On April 17, 2002, shortly after calling a game between the Indiana Pacers and Philadelphia 76ers on TNT, both Albert and color commentator Mike Fratello were injured in a limo accident in Trenton, New Jersey. Albert sustained facial lacerations, a concussion, and a sprained ankle. The 2002 NBA Playoffs was set to begin two days later, with Albert scheduled to call multiple games that week. Bob Costas filled in for those games, and Albert returned to call Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and Sacramento Kings.

On May 15, 2021, it was reported that Albert had planned on retiring following the 2021 NBA playoffs. The news became official two days later. His last game called was Game 6 of the 2021 NBA Eastern Conference Finals, between the Milwaukee Bucks and Atlanta Hawks.

====New Jersey Nets (YES)====
In 2005, Albert officially became the lead play-by-play man for the New Jersey Nets franchise started calling their games on the YES Network, often teaming with Brooklyn native and NBA veteran Mark Jackson. With that, the Nets had employed all three Albert brothers during the franchise&#x27;s history; Al started his broadcast career with the Nets during their ABA days, while Steve called Nets games during the late 1970s and 1980s. Beginning with the 2008–09 season, he was also paired with his TNT broadcast colleague Mike Fratello on the YES Network. However, with the Nets&#x27; struggles in the 2009–10 season, Nets management relegated him Albert to secondary play-by-play and was replaced by Ian Eagle. In 2011, Albert left the YES Network to join CBS Sports for NFL and NCAA tournament coverage.

====Other basketball-related ventures====
Albert hosts a basketball-focused interview show on NBA TV, which also airs on YES.

Albert also hosted the &quot;Dazzling Dunks and Basketball Bloopers&quot; VHS tape by NBA Entertainment in 1988.

Since 2003, Albert has also been providing the play-by-play voice on the &quot;NBA Live&quot; video-game series from EA Sports, a role he fulfilled until &quot;NBA Live 10&quot;.

From 2011 to 2015, Albert announced NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship tournament games, the result of longtime tournament broadcaster CBS handing off some of its coverage to Turner Sports.

In February 2016, Albert and Turner Sports announced that he would no longer call NCAA Tournament basketball games, stating that calling four games in one day during the first round, and a total of six matches in three days during the first two rounds, was too much for his 74-year-old voice to handle. Albert said that he &quot;felt it was the wiser move to go primarily NBA at this stage.&quot;

In 2022, Albert appeared in the &quot;Playoffs on NBA Lane&quot; short film alongside ESPN sideline reporter Malika Andrews.

===Outside basketball===

====New York Rangers====
In addition to the Knicks, Albert had a lengthy tenure (beginning in 1965) calling the games of another Madison Square Garden tenant, the New York Rangers. He handled the radio call of the Rangers&#x27; Stanley Cup-clinching victory in 1994.

He also famously coined the nickname &quot;Red Light&quot; for radio analyst Sal Messina, a former Rangers goaltender. His signature play-by-play phrase was &quot;kick save and a beauty.&quot;

Over his years as the Rangers&#x27; broadcaster, Albert missed a large number of games for other commitments. Many other broadcasters filled in, including several who later served long stints for other NHL teams, including Howie Rose, Mike Emrick, and John Kelly, as well as Albert&#x27;s brothers Al and Steve. It was his absence from Game 7 of the Rangers–Devils Eastern Conference Finals game that led to Rose&#x27;s famed &quot;Matteau, Matteau, Matteau&quot; call.

Albert left the Rangers after the 1994–95 season. At the same time, Rose took the job as a play-by-play announcer of the New York Islanders. Albert&#x27;s son, Kenny, replaced him and has been the radio voice of the Rangers ever since. Kenny also calls NHL and Olympic ice hockey for NBC Sports and has served as the national radio voice of the Stanley Cup Finals since 2016.

====New York Giants====
From 1973 to 1976, Albert called radio broadcasts of New York Giants football games, succeeding Marty Glickman after the latter started broadcasting for the New York Jets.

====&quot;Monday Night Football&quot;====
Albert was also the lead play-by-play voice of the Westwood One radio network&#x27;s NFL coverage from the 2002 to the 2009 seasons, calling &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; as well as numerous playoff games and every Super Bowl from 2003 to 2010. On June 4, 2010, it was announced that Albert was leaving his &quot;NFL on Westwood One&quot; duties. He was succeeded by Kevin Harlan.

====&quot;NFL on CBS&quot;====
On June 6, 2011, it was announced Albert was joining CBS Sports to call play-by-play for &quot;The NFL on CBS&quot;. Albert was usually teamed with Rich Gannon on broadcasts.

On May 29, 2014, Albert stepped down from calling &quot;The NFL on CBS&quot; to focus more on his basketball duties for TNT and CBS.

====Other network duties====
Other NBC Sports duties included play-by-play announcing for the NFL (by 1983, Albert was the No. 2 play-by-play man behind Dick Enberg, usually alternating the secondary NFL role year to year with Don Criqui), college basketball (teaming with Bucky Waters on Big East/ECAC games), horse racing, boxing (often working with Ferdie Pacheco and subsequently, Sugar Ray Leonard when NBC relaunched boxing under the &quot;Premier Boxing Champions&quot; umbrella), NHL All-Star Games (Albert called the NHL All-Star Game with John Davidson on NBC from 1990 to 1994), and Major League Baseball, as well as hosting baseball studio and pre-game shows (including NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1986 and 1988 World Series alongside Bob Costas). He also spent 13 years as the sports director of the network&#x27;s flagship station, WNBC-TV, in New York.

Albert also called regular-season and playoff NHL games for the syndicated NHL Network in the 1976–77 season, and, from 2000 to 2002, he helped call TNT&#x27;s coverage of the Wimbledon Championships tennis tournament.

===In popular culture===
Albert made 53 guest appearances on David Letterman&#x27;s late-night talk show for NBC and CBS. Each time Albert appeared, he brought with him a group of clips featuring sports bloopers and outstanding plays, which he narrated and dubbed the &quot;Albert Achievement Awards&quot;. The music accompanying the bloopers was &quot;12th Street Rag&quot;.

Albert was placed as No. 14 on David J. Halberstam&#x27;s list of Top 50 All-Time Network Television Sports Announcers on Yahoo! Sports.

He appears on &quot;Perfect Sense, Part II&quot;, on Roger Waters&#x27; 1992 album, &quot;Amused to Death&quot;, commentating on a military attack in the manner of a sports report.

Albert&#x27;s voice is imitated in the popular video game &quot;NBA Jam&quot;. The announcer was modeled on Albert, although there is no mention of Albert in the game and the announcer was actually voiced by Tim Kitzrow.

Jack Black and his bandmate Kyle Gass derived the name of their band &#x27;Tenacious D&#x27; from a term used by Albert to describe the tenacious defense of the New York Knicks in 1994.

==Sexual assault==
Albert was accused of sexually assaulting a 42-year-old woman in 1997. The woman accused Albert of throwing her onto a bed, biting her, then forcing her to perform oral sex after a February 12, 1997 argument in his Pentagon City hotel room. DNA testing linked Albert to genetic material taken from the bite marks and from semen in her underwear. During the trial, another woman, Patricia Masden, testified that Albert had bitten her on two separate occasions, in Miami in 1993 and in Dallas in 1994, which she viewed as unwanted sexual advances. Masden, a VIP liaison for Hyatt Hotels, claimed that Albert called her to help him send a fax from his Dallas hotel room, where she found him wearing &quot;white panties and garter belt&quot;. Albert&#x27;s defense team said that the judge blocked most of what they wanted to bring to trial in Albert&#x27;s defense, prompting them to accept a plea deal from the prosecutors. Albert pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and battery charges, while a felony charge of forcible sodomy was dropped. He was given a 12-month suspended sentence. The conviction was expunged from his record a year later, in accordance with the terms of his sentencing. In an interview with Barbara Walters, Albert maintained that his accuser had requested he bite her. He also denied her accusation that he had requested she bring another man into their sexual affair. He described her recorded conversation with the police on the night of the incident as &quot;an Academy Award performance&quot;.

NBC – for which Albert worked for over 20 years – fired him hours after he entered his guilty plea. His last NFL broadcast for NBC before being fired was the 1997 Baltimore Ravens-New York Giants game alongside Randy Cross and Len Berman. Bob Costas took over for Albert on &quot;NBA on NBC&quot; in the 1997–98 NBA season. Tom Hammond would eventually move up to the #2 team (behind Dick Enberg, Paul Maguire, and Phil Simms), while Dan Hicks would primarily call games with Hammond&#x27;s old partner, Jim Kelly. NBC rehired Albert less than two years after firing him, with Chairman of NBC Sports Dick Ebersol stating that, &quot;Marv has done what he had to do&quot; since being fired.

<text>The Minnesota Vikings are a professional American football team based in Minneapolis. The Vikings compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division. Founded in 1960 as an expansion team, the team began play the following year. They are named after the Vikings of medieval Scandinavia, reflecting the prominent Scandinavian American culture of Minnesota. The team plays its home games at U.S. Bank Stadium in the Downtown East section of Minneapolis.

The Vikings have an all-time overall record of , the highest regular season and combined winning percentage among NFL franchises who have not won a Super Bowl, in addition the most playoff runs, division titles, and (tied with the Buffalo Bills) Super Bowl appearances. They also have the most conference championship appearances of non-winning Super Bowl teams, with them being one of four (along with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Rams) to appear in a conference championship every decade since the 1970s.

==History==
Professional football in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area (the &quot;Twin Cities&quot;) began with the Minneapolis Marines/Red Jackets, an NFL team that played intermittently in the 1920s and 1930s. A new professional team in the area did not surface again until August 1959, when Minnesota businessmen Bill Boyer, H. P. Skoglund, and Max Winter were awarded a franchise in the new American Football League (AFL). Five months later, in January 1960, after significant pressure from the NFL, the ownership group, along with Bernard H. Ridder, reneged on its agreement with the AFL and then was awarded the National Football League&#x27;s 14th franchise, with play to begin in 1961. Ole Haugsrud was added to the NFL team ownership because, in the 1920s, when he sold his Duluth Eskimos team back to the league, the agreement allowed him 10 percent of any future Minnesota team. The teams from Ole Haugsrud&#x27;s high school, Central High School in Superior, Wisconsin, were also called the Vikings and had a similar purple-and-yellow color scheme.

From the team&#x27;s first season in 1961 to 1981, the team called Metropolitan Stadium in suburban Bloomington home. The Vikings conducted summer training camp at Bemidji State University from 1961 to 1965. In 1966, the team moved to their training camp to Minnesota State University in Mankato. The training camp at Minnesota State was one of the longest continuously running training camp events in the NFL and is remembered as part of the golden era history of the team. The Vikings played their home games at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis from 1982 to 2013. The Vikings played their last game at the Metrodome on December 29, 2013, defeating the Detroit Lions 14–13 to end the season.

Since the team&#x27;s first season in 1961, the Vikings have had one of the highest winning percentages in the NFL. As of 2022, they have won at least three games in every season except in 1962, and are one of only seven NFL teams to win at least 15 games in a regular season. The Vikings have won one NFL Championship, in 1969, before the league&#x27;s merger with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970. Since the merger, the team has qualified for the playoffs 28 times, third-most in the league (trailing only the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers). The team played in Super Bowls IV, VIII, IX and XI, but failed to win any of them. In addition, they have lost in their last six NFC Championship Game appearances, stretching back to 1978. The Vikings have 15 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

===1960s===
The team was officially named the Minnesota Vikings on September 27, 1960; the name is partly meant to reflect Minnesota&#x27;s place as a center of Scandinavian American culture. From the start, the Vikings embraced an energetic marketing program that produced first-year season ticket sales of nearly 26,000 and an average home attendance of 34,586, about 85 percent of Metropolitan Stadium&#x27;s capacity of 40,800. Eventually, the capacity of Met Stadium was increased to 47,900. Bert Rose, former public relations director for the Los Angeles Rams, was appointed the team&#x27;s first general manager. The search for the first head coach saw the team court then-Northwestern University head coach Ara Parseghian, who, according to &quot;Minneapolis Star&quot; writer Jim Klobuchar—the Vikings&#x27; first beat reporter for that newspaper—visited team management in the Twin Cities under the condition that his visit was to be kept secret from his current employer. His cover was blown by local columnist Sid Hartman, who reported the visit and forced Parseghian to issue denials. Philadelphia Eagles assistant Nick Skorich and a man with Minnesota ties who was working in the CFL, Bud Grant, were also candidates until a different Eagle, quarterback Norm Van Brocklin, was hired on January 18, 1961. Van Brocklin had just finished his career as a player on a high note, having defeated the Green Bay Packers in the 1960 NFL Championship Game.


As a new franchise, the Vikings had the first overall selection in the 1961 NFL draft, and they picked running back Tommy Mason of Tulane. They also took a young quarterback from the University of Georgia named Fran Tarkenton in the third round. Notable veterans acquired in the offseason were George Shaw and Hugh McElhenny. The Vikings won their first regular-season game, defeating the Chicago Bears 37–13 on Opening Day 1961; Tarkenton came off the bench to throw four touchdown passes and run for another to lead the upset. Reality set in as the expansion team lost its next seven games on their way to a 3–11 record. The losing continued throughout much of the 1960s as the Vikings had a combined record of 32 wins, 59 losses, and 7 ties in their first seven seasons with only one winning season (8–5–1 in 1964).

On March 7, 1967, quarterback Fran Tarkenton was traded to the New York Giants for a first-round and second-round draft choice in 1967, a first-round choice in 1968 and a second-round choice in 1969. With the picks, Minnesota selected Clinton Jones and Bob Grim in 1967, Ron Yary in 1968 and Ed White in 1969. On March 10, 1967, the Vikings hired new head coach Bud Grant to replace Van Brocklin, who had resigned on February 11, 1967. Grant came to the Vikings from the Canadian Football League as head coach for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, whom he led to four Grey Cup Championships in 10 years. Replacing Tarkenton at quarterback was eight-year CFL veteran and Grey Cup champion Joe Kapp. During the late 1960s, the Vikings built a powerful defense known as the Purple People Eaters, led by Alan Page, Carl Eller, Gary Larsen, and Jim Marshall. In 1968, that stingy defense earned the Vikings their first Central Division title and their first playoff berth.

In 1969, the Vikings secured a 12–2 record. The team had 12 straight regular-season victories after a season-opening loss to the New York Giants, which was the longest single-season winning streak in 35 years. The Vikings defeated the Cleveland Browns 27–7 in the last pre-merger NFL Championship Game on January 4, 1970, at Metropolitan Stadium. The Vikings became the first modern NFL expansion team to win an NFL Championship Game, and earned a berth in Super Bowl IV; however, the heavily favored Vikings lost that game to the Kansas City Chiefs, 23–7. The team MVP that season was Joe Kapp, who threw for seven touchdowns against the Baltimore Colts – still an all-time NFL record; however, Kapp refused to accept the award, stating, &quot;There is not one most valuable Viking... there are 40 most valuable Vikings!&quot;

===1970s===
The team continued to dominate in 1970 (moving into the newly formed NFC Central) and 1971, reaching the playoffs behind the stubborn &quot;Purple People Eaters&quot; defensive line. In 1971, Alan Page won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award given by the Associated Press. He was the first defensive player to win the award.

On January 27, 1972, the Vikings traded Norm Snead, Bob Grim, Vince Clements and first-round draft picks in 1972 and 1973 to the New York Giants to reacquire the popular Fran Tarkenton. While the acquisitions of Tarkenton and wide receiver John Gilliam improved the passing attack, the running game was inconsistent and the Vikings finished with a disappointing 7–7 record. The Vikings addressed the problem by drafting running back Chuck Foreman with their first pick in the 1973 draft. Co-owner Bill Boyer died on February 19, 1973 and was replaced on the team&#x27;s board of directors by his son-in-law Jack Steele.

The Vikings won their first nine games of 1973 and finished the season with a 12–2 record. They then advanced to their second Super Bowl in franchise history, Super Bowl VIII, against the Miami Dolphins at Rice Stadium in Houston, Texas; however, the Dolphins prevailed, 24–7.

The Vikings won the Central Division again in 1974 with a 10–4 record. In the playoffs they built on their cold-weather reputation, defeating both the St. Louis Cardinals 30–14 and the Los Angeles Rams 14–10 in frozen Metropolitan Stadium. The Vikings played in their second straight Super Bowl, Super Bowl IX (3rd overall), losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 16–6, at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans on January 12, 1975.

Led by Tarkenton and running back Chuck Foreman, the 1975 Vikings got off to a 10–0 start and easily won another division title. However, the Vikings lost to the Dallas Cowboys in the playoffs, 17–14, on a controversial touchdown pass from the Cowboys&#x27; quarterback Roger Staubach to wide receiver Drew Pearson that became known as the Hail Mary. The touchdown was controversial because many felt that Pearson pushed off on Vikings defensive back Nate Wright, committing pass interference. As the Metropolitan Stadium crowd was stunned to learn that no penalty was called, debris was thrown on the field for several minutes. A Corby&#x27;s Whiskey bottle struck game official Armen Terzian, rendering him unconscious.

The Vikings played in Super Bowl XI, their third Super Bowl (fourth overall) in four years, against the Oakland Raiders at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on January 9, 1977. The Vikings, however, lost 32–14.

In 1977, the Vikings again won the Central Division with a 9–5 record and advanced to their 4th NFC Championship Game in 5 years, but were defeated by the eventual Super Bowl Champion Cowboys, 23–6, at Texas Stadium.

By 1978, age was taking its toll on the Vikings, but they still made the playoffs with an 8–7–1 record. There was no more playoff magic as the Rams finally defeated the Vikings, 34–10 in Los Angeles after having lost in their previous four playoff matchups (in 1969, &#x27;74, &#x27;76 and &#x27;77). Quarterback Fran Tarkenton retired following the season holding league passer records in attempts (6,467), completions (3,686), yards (47,003), and touchdowns (342).

In December 1979, ground was broken for construction of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in downtown Minneapolis.

===1980s===
On May 15, 1981, the Vikings moved into a new facility in suburban Eden Prairie that housed the team&#x27;s offices, locker room and practice fields. The complex was named &quot;Winter Park&quot; after Max Winter, one of the Vikings&#x27; founders, who served as the team&#x27;s president from 1965 to 1987. The Vikings played their final game at Metropolitan Stadium on December 20 to conclude the 1981 NFL season by losing to the Kansas City Chiefs, 10–6.

The Vikings played their first game at the Metrodome in a preseason matchup against the Seattle Seahawks on August 21, 1982, in a game Minnesota won, 7–3. The first touchdown in the new facility was scored by Joe Senser on an 11-yard pass from Tommy Kramer. The first regular-season game in the Metrodome was the 1982 opener on September 12, when the Vikings defeated Tampa Bay, 17–10. Rickey Young scored the first regular-season touchdown in the facility on a 3-yard run in the 2nd quarter. That year the defense led by Joey Browner began a dominant 10-year run as a premier NFL defensive back. The Vikings beat the St. Louis Cardinals 28–10 on August 6, 1983, at Wembley Stadium in London in the first international game in the NFL.

On January 27, 1984, Bud Grant retired as head coach of the Vikings. With a career regular-season record of 151–87–5 (.632) in 17 seasons with Minnesota, Grant led the franchise to 12 playoff appearances, 11 division titles, and four Super Bowls. Les Steckel, who was an offensive assistant with the Vikings for 5 seasons, was then named the 3rd head coach in franchise history. Steckel, who came to the Vikings in 1979 after working as an assistant with the 49ers, was the youngest head coach in the NFL in 1984 at age 38. However, the Vikings lost a franchise-worst 13 games. After the season Steckel was fired, and on December 18, 1984, Bud Grant came out of retirement and was rehired as the head coach of the Vikings.

On January 6, 1986, following the 1985 season, Bud Grant re-retired, this time permanently, as head coach of the Vikings. At the time of his retirement he held the 6th best winning record for a coach in NFL history with 168 career wins, including playoffs. In 18 seasons, he led the Vikings to a 158–96–5 regular-season record. Longtime Vikings assistant coach Jerry Burns was named the fourth head coach in team history on January 7, 1986. He served as the Vikings&#x27; offensive coordinator from 1968 to 1985, when the team won 11 division titles and played in four Super Bowls. In his first season, the Vikings, led by the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Tommy Kramer, went 9–7, their first winning record in four years. On August 2, 1986, Fran Tarkenton was the first player who played the majority of his career with the Vikings to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Following the strike-shortened 1987 season, the 8–7 Vikings, who had finished 8–4 in regular games but 0–3 using strike-replacement players, pulled two upsets in the playoffs. They defeated the 12–3 New Orleans Saints 44–10 at the Louisiana Superdome in the Wild Card game. The following week, in the Divisional Playoff game, they beat the 13–2 San Francisco 49ers 36–24 at Candlestick Park. During that game, Anthony Carter set the all-time record for most receiving yards in a playoff game with 227 yards. The Vikings played the Washington Redskins in the NFC Championship Game on January 17, 1988, at RFK Stadium. Trailing 17–10, the Vikings drove to the Redskins&#x27; 6-yard line with a little over a minute left in the game, but failed to get the ball into the end zone. The Vikings&#x27; hopes of a Super Bowl ended when Darrin Nelson dropped a pass from Wade Wilson on fourth down at the goal line.

On October 12, 1989, the Vikings acquired Herschel Walker from Dallas. The final result of the trade gave the Vikings Walker, third-round choice Mike Jones, fifth-round choice Reggie Thornton and 10th-round choice Pat Newman in 1990 and a third-round choice Jake Reed in 1991. Dallas received Issiac Holt, David Howard, Darrin Nelson, Jesse Solomon, Alex Stewart, a first-, second- and a sixth-round choice in 1990, first- and second-round choices in 1991 and a first-, second- and third-round choice in 1992. Two of those selections turned into Emmitt Smith and Darren Woodson. Walker&#x27;s performance fell short of expectations in his three seasons with the Vikings, while the Cowboys rode their draft picks to three Super Bowl victories in the early-to-mid-1990s.

===1990s===

On December 3, 1991, Jerry Burns announced his retirement effective at the end of the 1991 season. In six seasons as head coach of the Vikings, Burns compiled a career record of 52–43 (.547). He also led Minnesota to three playoff appearances, including a division title and an NFC Championship Game. Dennis Green was later named the fifth head coach in team history, after turning around a struggling Stanford University football program as head coach from 1989 to 1991. In his 10 seasons as the coach of the Vikings, Green won four NFC Central division titles, had eight playoff appearances, two NFC Championship Game appearances and an all-time record of 97–62. The Vikings therefore had the fifth highest winning percentage among all NFL teams during the regular season in the 1990s.

====1998====

1998 was a year to remember for the franchise. With a spectacular offense led by quarterback Randall Cunningham (who replaced an injured Brad Johnson), running back Robert Smith, veteran wide receiver Cris Carter, and explosive rookie Randy Moss, the Vikings set a then-NFL record by scoring a total of 556 points, never scoring fewer than 24 in a game. The Vikings finished the season 15–1, their only loss was to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 27–24 in Week 9. In the playoffs, the Vikings rolled past the Arizona Cardinals 41–21, and came into the Metrodome heavily favored for their NFC title showdown with the Atlanta Falcons, who had gone 14–2 in the regular season. After kicker Gary Anderson, who had just completed the first perfect regular season in NFL history (not missing a single extra point or field goal attempt the entire year), missed a 38-yard field goal attempt with just over 2 minutes remaining, the Falcons&#x27; ensuing drive tied the game. This led to a controversial decision by head coach Dennis Green to run out the clock and let the game go to overtime. Though the Vikings won the coin toss, Atlanta went on to win it 30–27 in overtime on Morten Andersen&#x27;s 38-yard field goal. The Vikings became the first 15–1 team to fail to reach the Super Bowl.

====1999====

Cunningham resumed duties again in 1999, but after a lukewarm 2–4 start, Jeff George replaced him as starting quarterback. He finished the season with an 8–2 record, and led the Vikings into the postseason once again, with an overall team record of 10–6. Minnesota beat Dallas in the Wild Card game 27–10, and faced playoff newcomer Kurt Warner and the St. Louis Rams in the Divisional matchup. The game was a shootout that Minnesota led 17–14 at halftime, but the Rams outscored Minnesota 35–20 in the second half to win 49–37.

===2000s===
The Vikings entered the decade by winning the divisional championship and an appearance in the NFC Championship game, where they were defeated 41–0 by the New York Giants. The following season, they struggled by posting a 5–11 record in 2001. The team made the playoffs again in 2004, but did not win a divisional title again until 2008. Since the merger, the 2000s became the decade with the fewest playoff berths for the franchise.

====2000====

In 2000, the Vikings went 11–5. The Vikings were 11–2 after 14 weeks, but slumped briefly, losing their last three to the Rams, Packers and Colts while starting quarterback Daunte Culpepper was hampered by injury. Nonetheless, the Vikings made the playoffs for the fifth straight year. After easily beating the Saints in the Divisional game 34–16, they traveled to New York City to face the Giants in the NFC Championship Game. Though they were the road team, the Vikings were favored to win the game (since most considered their 11–2 record with Culpepper more indicative than their 0–3 record when he was out); instead, the Vikings were defeated 41–0, their worst defeat in playoff history. Robert Smith, who ran for 1,521 yards that season, retired at the end of the year after only playing eight NFL seasons.

====2001–2005====
In 2001, after a disappointing 5–11 season, the Vikings bought out the contract of Dennis Green, despite his successful coaching tenure with the team. Mike Tice coached the final game of 2001, losing to the Ravens 19–3. Tice was named the permanent coach after the season, but he would not lead the Vikings back to the playoffs until 2004. In 2002, as part of the league&#x27;s realignment with the addition of the Houston Texans, the Vikings and their other traditional NFC Central rivals became part of the newly formed NFC North.

During the 2003 season, the Vikings came close to getting into the playoffs. However, the Arizona Cardinals completed a game-winning touchdown on 4th-and-28 with 0:00 left, knocking the Vikings out of the playoffs. The moment of Arizona&#x27;s touchdown was actually the first moment the entire season in which the Vikings hadn&#x27;t led their division. The Vikings became the second team in football history to miss the playoffs after getting off to a 6–0 start, following the 1978 Washington Redskins.

In 2004, Daunte Culpepper amassed MVP-like statistics, throwing for 4,717 passing yards (leading the NFL), 39 passing touchdowns (a Viking record), and 5,123 total yards (an NFL record). In the wild card game, the Vikings defeated the rival Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field in their first-ever playoff meeting, 31–17. In doing so, the Vikings became the second team in NFL history to have a .500 record (8–8) in the regular season and win a playoff game (The St. Louis Rams did the same thing only a day earlier). In the divisional round, the Vikings were defeated by the eventual NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles.

On March 2, 2005, Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss was traded to the Oakland Raiders for linebacker Napoleon Harris and the Raiders&#x27; first-round draft pick. After struggling to a disappointing 2–5 start to the 2005 season, Vikings lost quarterback Daunte Culpepper to a season-ending knee injury. This injury was a very significant part to this Minnesota Vikings team due to the fact they also lost Moss. The dynamic duo from years earlier was now gone and a new leader would eventually emerge. The Vikings finished the 2005 season with a 9–7 record.

In October, 17 team members were part of a party of about 90 that went out on a pleasure cruise on local Lake Minnetonka. The incident erupted into scandal when media reported that a number of the players had performed sex acts and that prostitutes had been flown in. Four players were ultimately charged with misdemeanors related to the party.

Mike Tice was fired by owner Zygi Wilf after the 2005 season and was replaced by Brad Childress.

====2006–2008====

Minnesota began the 2006 season 4–2 (with Childress becoming the first Vikings coach to start his career 2–0), but finished the year at 6–10, receiving the 7th pick in the NFL draft; with it, the Vikings selected Adrian Peterson out of the University of Oklahoma.

Peterson&#x27;s first career touchdown was a 60-yard screen pass against the Atlanta Falcons in his first career game. When the Vikings played the Chicago Bears in Week 6, Peterson broke the record for single-game All-Purpose (rushing, receiving, kick returning) yards (361 total yards, 224 rushing). In Week 9, Peterson broke the NFL single-game rushing record set by Jamal Lewis in 2003 by rushing for 296 yards against the San Diego Chargers. Despite a strong push in the middle of the season, winning five straight games, the Vikings lost their final two games to finish the season at 8–8 and missed the playoffs.

In Week 13 of the 2008 season against the Bears, Gus Frerotte hooked up with Bernard Berrian and set the record for longest play in franchise history with a 99-yard touchdown pass. In the 2009 season, Adrian Peterson led the NFL with 1760 rushing yards, breaking the franchise record. The Vikings clinched the NFC North championship for the first time after defeating the New York Giants 20–19 in Week 17, when kicker Ryan Longwell made the game-winning field goal. Peterson had 19 carries for 109 yards and added a touchdown during the game.

On January 4, 2009, the Vikings hosted the Philadelphia Eagles for the wild-card round, their first home playoff game in eight years. The Eagles led the Viking 16–14 at halftime and, coming off a 44–6 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, went on to defeat the Vikings 26–14.

Since 2006, the Vikings have been known especially for their strong run defense (#1 in the NFL in 2006, 2007, and 2008; they are the first NFL team to accomplish this since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970), anchored by the Williams Wall consisting of defensive tackle Kevin Williams and nose tackle Pat Williams (no relation). With the addition of sack-leader Jared Allen in 2008, the dominant front four began being called by several nicknames, including &quot;Thunder and Plunder&quot; and &quot;Shock and AWE&quot; (an acronym of their surname initials).

====2009====
On August 18, 2009, after months of speculation and negotiations, twice-retired veteran quarterback Brett Favre, who until 2007 had played 16 years for division archrival Green Bay Packers, signed a two-year, $25 million deal with the Vikings.

On October 5, 2009, the Vikings hosted the Green Bay Packers as Favre played his former team for the first time. With a 30–23 victory on Monday Night Football, the Vikings moved to a 4–0 record. Favre became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat all 32 current teams as a starter. Over 21.8 million viewers tuned in to watch the game, beating the previous record for a cable television program set by a game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys in 2008 (18.6 million viewers).

The Vikings beat the New York Giants, 44–7, in Week 17 to help the team clinch the second seed in the conference and a first-round-bye with an Eagles loss later that same day. The Vikings ended the regular season with a 12–4 record, their best record since 2000 and the first 11-plus win season since their record-setting 1998 campaign. The Vikings played the Dallas Cowboys in the divisional round on January 17, 2010, and won the game by a score of 34–3, advancing the Vikings to the NFC Championship game, the ninth in franchise history. This would also be the first NFC Championship game for the team since the 2000 season. Minnesota would travel to New Orleans the following week to face the top-seeded Saints in the first conference championship game held at the Superdome. Despite out-gaining the Saints on offense by nearly a twofold margin, the Vikings were severely hindered by five turnovers, including a Favre interception in the final minute of the fourth quarter in Saints territory. They were ousted in overtime, 31–28, as the Saints won the coin toss and kicked a 40-yard field goal on the first possession of overtime.

===2010s===
The Vikings performed similarly in the 2010s, only making the playoffs four times and going 2–4 in those games. Additionally, there was inconsistency at the quarterback position, with thirteen quarterbacks starting at least one game for the team during this decade. Despite their performance, the team performed better in the regular season overall after the 2013 season, including an NFC Championship appearance in 2017.

====2010–2013====
In the first week of the 2010 NFL regular season, the Vikings played the defending Super Bowl champions, the New Orleans Saints. The Vikings lost 14–9. In Week 2, the Vikings played the Miami Dolphins and lost 14–10. The Vikings defeated the Detroit Lions 24–10 in the third week of the season. After a week four bye-week, the Vikings received star wide receiver Randy Moss in a trade with the New England Patriots. Even with the addition of Moss, the Vikings lost to the New York Jets 29–20 in Week 5. The Vikings won a crucial victory against another struggling team in the form of the Dallas Cowboys 24–21, but in Week 7 the Vikings lost to the arch-rival Green Bay Packers 28–24. In Week 9, the Vikings played the Arizona Cardinals at home and won 27–24 in overtime, coming back from a 24–10 deficit in the final four minutes of regulation. Favre threw for a career-high 446 passing yards. The Vikings then went on to face the Chicago Bears, but were defeated, and then went on to be blown out 31–3 at home by the Packers the following game. Head coach Brad Childress was fired the following Monday. With Leslie Frazier filling in for the fired Childress, the Vikings won two games in a row. One against the Washington Redskins on the road, and a blowout win over the Buffalo Bills at home.

After a winter storm dropped nearly of snow in the Minneapolis/St Paul area the Saturday before the Vikings December 12 home game versus the New York Giants and gusts drove snow removers off the dome&#x27;s roof overnight, several panels were damaged as the weight of the snow caused the roof to collapse. After viewing the damage, Vikings management and the NFL decided to move the game to Monday and play it at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. Because of ongoing repairs to the roof of the Metrodome, the Vikings played their December 20 game versus the Chicago Bears at TCF Bank Stadium. Favre threw the final touchdown pass of his career (to Percy Harvin) in this game. On December 26, the NFL announced that the game versus the Philadelphia Eagles was being postponed to Tuesday, December 28, 2010, because of blizzard conditions. This marks the third consecutive venue or date change for a Vikings game and was the first NFL game played on a Tuesday since 1964. The Vikings proceeded to upset the dynamic Eagles offense, led by a resurgent Michael Vick, 24–14 with rookie Joe Webb at the helm. The Vikings finished the season 6–10 with a 20–13 loss against the Detroit Lions.

The 2010–11 season was a step down for the Minnesota Vikings. After coming within a few plays of Super Bowl XLIV, Minnesota ended the 2010 season with a 6–10 record and a last place finish in the NFC North for the first time since 1990. During the season, the Vikings had many distractions, including trading for Randy Moss and then waiving him only a month later, Brett Favre&#x27;s NFL investigation for allegedly sending inappropriate text messages to Jets&#x27; employee Jenn Sterger while he was with the team in 2008, the Metrodome&#x27;s collapse and resulting venue changes, and finally head coach Brad Childress&#x27; firing on November 22 following a 31–3 loss at the hands of the rival Green Bay Packers.

After serving as the interim head coach for the final six games of the season (finishing with a 3–3 record), defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier was officially named the head coach on January 3, 2011, after signing a three-year contract. On January 17, Brett Favre retired for the third, and officially last, time, leaving the team in search of a long-term replacement at the quarterback position. Wasting no time after being appointed head coach, Frazier began to restructure the team&#x27;s coaching staff, including letting go of offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell and hiring Mike Singletary as linebackers coach and Bill Musgrave as the new offensive coordinator. Their first-round draft pick was Christian Ponder, a quarterback from Florida State University. The team finished with a 3–13 record, tied with the 1984 Vikings for the second-worst record in franchise history.
During the 2012 NFL draft, the team selected USC lineman Matt Kalil with the 4th overall pick after a trade with the Cleveland Browns, and Notre Dame safety Harrison Smith in the first round. Both players were instrumental in helping the Vikings reach the playoffs for the 27th time in franchise history, as was fellow draftee, sixth-round kicker Blair Walsh. After beating the Packers in the final game of 2012 to reach the playoffs as the NFC&#x27;s sixth seed, the Vikings lost 24–10 to the Packers in the rematch at Lambeau Field in the wild-card round. The team was forced to play backup Joe Webb during the game after Ponder was sidelined due to an arm injury sustained from the previous week. Peterson was later named the league&#x27;s MVP, after rushing for 2,097 yards, the second most rushing yards in a season in NFL history.

In the 2013 season, the Vikings finished with five wins, ten losses, and one tie, with no road wins. Notable moments include acquired free agent Matt Cassel outplaying Christian Ponder at the quarterback position and the defense allowing a league-worst 480 points, coming within four points of matching the franchise&#x27;s worst set in 1984. This was also the last season played at the Metrodome as a new stadium deal was reached. Leslie Frazier was fired after the regular season ended.

====2014–2019====

The team hired former Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer to replace Leslie Frazier as head coach on January 16, 2014. Former Cleveland Browns offensive coordinator Norv Turner replaced Bill Musgrave, and George Edwards replaced Alan Williams as defensive coordinator. In the 2014 NFL draft, the Vikings selected Anthony Barr, a linebacker out of UCLA, and Teddy Bridgewater, a quarterback out of the University of Louisville. Bridgewater would later lose the starting job to Matt Cassel only to become the starter for the Vikings when Cassel was lost to a season-ending foot injury in week 3. Star running back Adrian Peterson only played in one regular-season game due to his ongoing child abuse trial, with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell placing Peterson on the Commissioner&#x27;s Exempt List indefinitely. On April 16, 2015, the league released a statement issuing Peterson&#x27;s reinstatement to occur on April 17, 2015. The Vikings concluded their season with seven wins and nine losses, winning only one game against a divisional opponent, although Bridgewater set a franchise record for wins by a rookie starting quarterback. On January 3, 2016, the Vikings beat divisional rival Green Bay 20–13 to win the NFC North for the first time since 2009. The Vikings, led by their top 5 defense, ended the 2015 season with an 11–5 record, and a #3 seed in the playoffs. However, they lost to the Seattle Seahawks 10–9 after Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard field goal in the third coldest game in NFL playoff history.

The Vikings were responsible for a historic milestone in the late rounds of the 2016 NFL draft. Their sixth-round selection, German wide receiver Moritz Böhringer, was the first European player ever to be drafted by an NFL team without having previously played at any level in North America. After Teddy Bridgewater went down with a knee injury in the preseason of 2016, the Vikings traded their 2017 first round pick and a conditional fourth round pick to the Philadelphia Eagles for quarterback Sam Bradford, who threw for 20 touchdowns, 5 interceptions, 3,877 yards, and while starting the season a league best 5–0, completed the season 3–8 for a season total of 8–8. Following the knee injury, the Vikings declined to pick up the fifth-year option on Bridgewater. Running back Adrian Peterson went down to injury in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers with a torn meniscus and was placed on the Injured Reserve until Week 15. On February 28, 2017, the Vikings announced they would not exercise Peterson&#x27;s 2017 contract option which made him a free agent. Had they exercised the option, Peterson would be owed $18 million for the 2017 season. On April 25, 2017, the New Orleans Saints signed Peterson to a two-year, $7 million contract, ending his tenure with the Vikings since his debut in 2007 as a rookie. He holds several Vikings records including most career rushing touchdowns, career rushing yards, and most rushing yards in a season.

In the summer of 2017, the Vikings ownership announced they would end the 52-year annual tradition of summer training camp in Mankato at Minnesota State University, Mankato as they built a large new headquarters building, training facility and area property development in Eagan on the site of the former Northwest Airlines offices completed in the spring of 2018 in time for the 2018 summer training camp that July.

The Vikings won the NFC North for the second time in three years in 2017, finishing with a 13–3 record that saw them go into the playoffs as the #2 seed in the NFC. In the divisional round, they came up against the New Orleans Saints. With less than 10 seconds remaining in the game and trailing by a single point, the Vikings lined up on 3rd-and-10 on their own 39-yard line. Quarterback Case Keenum threw the ball to wide receiver Stefon Diggs inside field goal range near the right sideline, giving the receiver a chance to get out of bounds with just enough time for a game-winning field goal attempt; however, safety Marcus Williams missed his attempted tackle, allowing Diggs to run down the sideline unopposed for the first walk-off game-winning touchdown in NFL playoff history. On KFAN 100.3, radio announcer Paul Allen called the play the &#x27;Minneapolis Miracle&#x27;. The Vikings went on to the NFC Championship for the opportunity to play in Super Bowl LII in their own stadium, only to lose 38–7 to the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles.

On March 15, 2018, quarterback Kirk Cousins signed a three-year fully guaranteed $84 million contract with the Vikings. The signing made Cousins the highest paid football player at the time. The Vikings finished with a 8–7–1 record and missed the playoffs in the 2018 season.

On September 22, 2019, the Vikings defeated the Oakland Raiders for their 500th win as a franchise, with an overall record of 500–427–11 at that point. The team finished the 2019 season at 10–6, clinching a wild card spot. The Vikings went on to pull an upset victory in the wild card round against the New Orleans Saints 26–20 in overtime. The victory advanced the team to the divisional round, where they lost to the eventual NFC champions San Francisco 49ers 10–27.

===2020s===

====2020====
The Vikings used the 22nd overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft on All-Pro wide receiver Justin Jefferson. After falling to the New Orleans Saints on Christmas Day, the Minnesota Vikings were eliminated from the 2020 playoffs. The Vikings finished 7–9 in 2020, the first losing season since 2014 and only the second under Zimmer.

====2021====
In 2021, the Vikings missed the playoffs for the second straight season after a 37–10 loss to the Green Bay Packers in Week 17. After a 31–17 win over the Chicago Bears in Week 18 to finish the season 8–9, the team fired head coach Mike Zimmer and general manager Rick Spielman on January 10, 2022.

====2022====
On January 26, 2022, the Vikings hired Kwesi Adofo-Mensah, former vice president of football operations at the Cleveland Browns and Director of R&amp;D at the San Francisco 49ers, to be the team&#x27;s new general manager. After the Los Angeles Rams won Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022, the Vikings subsequently named then-Rams offensive coordinator Kevin O&#x27;Connell as their franchise&#x27;s 10th head coach on February 16. The Vikings finished the regular season as NFC North champions with a 13–4 record. They also set an NFL record by winning 11 one-score games, the most in any NFL season. The Vikings entered the playoffs as the number three seed in the NFC but lost in the wild-card round to the New York Giants 31–24.

====2023====
In Week 8, the Vikings lost Kirk Cousins for the season to an Achilles injury. The Vikings closed out the year with Jaren Hall, Joshua Dobbs, and Nick Mullens seeing time at quarterback. The team finished the 2023 season with a 7–10 record. In the offseason, Cousins departed for the Atlanta Falcons. The Vikings had the 10th overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft and used it on Michigan quarterback J. J. McCarthy.

==== 2024 ====

While first-round draft pick JJ McCarthy was originally speculated to have the opportunity to be a starter, battling for the QB1 positions with journeyman backup Sam Darnold, who had been signed in the offseason. However, after encountering knee swelling the day after his NFL debut in a pre-season game, McCarthy underwent knee surgery for his meniscus, ending his season. Darnold became the starter, but there was not much excitement around him. Initial predictions for the Vikings record were shaky, with estimations such as 9–8 and 7–10. Darnold, however, had a breakout season, by week 17 leading the Vikings to a 14–2 record, becoming the first quarterback in the NFL to win 14 games in their first season with a team.

==Logo and uniforms==
The Vikings&#x27; trademark horned helmet and purple-and-gold uniforms were designed by &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; cartoonist Karl Hubenthal. Bert Rose and Norm Van Brocklin both knew Hubenthal from their days with the Los Angeles Rams organization. Hubenthal also designed the original Norseman logo.

From the team&#x27;s debut in 1961 to 1995, the Vikings&#x27; logos and uniforms essentially remained the same. Reflecting Minnesota&#x27;s Scandinavian cultural heritage, one of the team&#x27;s two primary logos consists of a profile of a blond Norseman, while the other consists of a white Viking horn.
The team&#x27;s helmet is purple with a Viking horn logo on each side. Each horn is outlined in gold. The horn logo was slightly revised in 2006. The original uniform design consisted of white pants, gold trim, and either purple or white jerseys. On the jersey&#x27;s sleeves was the Northwestern stripe pattern in white with gold trim. For the white uniform the stripes were purple with gold trim as well. From 1962 to 1964, the Vikings wore purple pants with their white jerseys (The Vikings, with their current uniform, still wear, purple pants with yellow and white trim). In 1969, the design for the white uniforms had changed to a completely different stripe pattern, which was over the shoulders, then the purple ones, which were around the sleeve cuff. These unique shoulder stripes were first worn in 1969, the year they went to their first Super Bowl. There have also been minor changes to the uniform design throughout the years, such as changing the color of the face mask from gray to white in 1980, and then to purple in 1985. In addition, the Norseman logo was added to the sleeves in 1996, and the purple jersey stripes were toned down with that change; the &quot;TV numbers&quot;, previously located on the jersey sleeves, moved up to the shoulders as well that year. The Vikings continued to wear black shoes until Les Steckel became head coach in 1984; they were the last NFL team to make the change from black to white shoes. In 2006, the team returned to black shoes for the first time since the 1983 season.

The Vikings tweaked their Norseman logo, which involved updating the shading, altering the shape and base of the horns, thickening the mustache and face, making the gold tones brighter, and shortening the braid. The new logo was unveiled on February 14, 2013. On March 28, the team reported that new uniforms will be unveiled on April 25.

On April 25, 2013, the Minnesota Vikings unveiled the club&#x27;s new uniforms during its annual NFL draft party.

From 1969 through 1973, the Vikings had an alternate purple jersey without stripes for warm-weather games.

The team&#x27;s uniforms were redesigned in 2006, the first significant change in the franchise&#x27;s 46-year history. Although the team colors remained the same, trim lines were added to the outside shoulders and sleeves, and the sides of the jerseys and pants. In addition, the horn on the helmet was slightly more defined. Included in the new design are both white and purple pants, the purple pants have not been regularly used since 2007, but resurfaced twice in 2010.

The team wore black armbands for the last four games in 1978 in memory of Jack &quot;Jocko&quot; Nelson, an assistant coach who died during the season. In 1985 the team wore a 25 years patch on their jerseys. In 1989, they wore a &quot;40 for 60&quot; patch honoring the 1969 NFL championship team. They wore a 35 years patch in 1995, 40 years in 2000 and 45 years in 2005. They also wore patches in 1999 for assistant coach Chip Myers who died in the offseason and in 2001 for Korey Stringer. The Vikings, like other teams, wore NFL 50th and 75th-anniversary patches in 1969 and 1994.

They also wore &quot;TS&quot; decals on their helmets in memory of Tony Sparano in the 2018 NFL season, their offensive-line coach who died before the season started.

On December 24, 2022, in a Week 16 game against the New York Giants, the Vikings wore all-white uniforms at home in the regular season for the first time. As part of the &quot;Winter Whiteout&quot; event, the team painted its logo and end zones white with purple accents, and encouraged fans at the stadium to wear white. The Vikings again wore the all-white uniforms at home against the Detroit Lions on December 24, 2023. On June 6, 2024, the Vikings unveiled a new alternate &quot;Winter Warrior&quot; uniform, which is all-white with purple and silver stripes and a new Vikings wordmark. The uniform is paired with an alternate white helmet, featuring a silver middle stripe and the traditional horn decal in silver trimmed in purple.

In 2023, the Vikings unveiled throwback uniforms based on the 1960s purple uniforms, which had gold trim on the numbers. However, the current matte purple helmet would be used, with gray facemasks and throwback horn decals.

===All-purple uniforms===
On October 11, 1964, for a home game against the Detroit Lions, the Vikings decided to wear their road uniform of white jerseys and purple pants; however, the Lions mistakenly only brought their white jerseys to Minnesota. The game began with both teams wearing white, but it proved too confusing, and ahead of the second quarter, the Vikings changed into their purple jerseys; however, they did not change their pants, resulting in the first time the Vikings wore all-purple for a game. It was not until 43 years later, on December 17, 2007 (a Monday Night Football game against the Chicago Bears) that the Vikings again wore both purple jerseys and purple pants—the first time they wore all-purple intentionally. They repeated this three years later, the wearing all-purple for the November 7, 2010, home game against the Arizona Cardinals.

The NFL introduced &quot;Color Rush&quot; uniforms for all 32 teams in the 2016 season, specifically for &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; games. The Vikings had an all-purple uniform with gold numbers and stripes on the pants, which made its only appearance as a Color Rush uniform in Week 13 at home against the Dallas Cowboys. After the program was discontinued in 2018, these uniforms have become the team&#x27;s primary alternate and are now known under the name &quot;Primetime Purple&quot;; however, the Vikings only wear these uniforms during home Thursday Night games. They wore the uniforms under the Primetime Purple name for the first time during a game against the Washington Redskins in 2019. In the team&#x27;s Wild Card game against the New Orleans Saints during the 2019 season, the Vikings wore all purple again; however, instead of the regular alternates, they wore the regular home uniforms with the away purple pants. Following the Vikings&#x27; win in this game, they have worn this combination in two subsequent games against the Saints, which took place in 2020 and 2022.

In 2020, despite the Vikings not having a Thursday Night game scheduled, the Primetime Purple uniforms made an appearance for a late-afternoon game against the Cowboys. The following season, they were worn again for a Thursday Night home game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The most recent appearance for these uniforms came during a Thanksgiving Day game against the New England Patriots in 2022.

===All-white uniform===

On June 6, 2024, the Minnesota Vikings unveiled an all-white &quot;Winter Warrior&quot; uniform. It features a white helmet with a satin finish and is adorned with a metallic gray stripe inspired by the metal stripping found on traditional Viking helmets. The uniform is based on the team&#x27;s decision to wear their standard white jerseys and white pants for one game in both the 2022 and 2023 seasons, which the Vikings dubbed &quot;Winter Whiteouts&quot;. This uniform is the first in Minnesota history to include a white helmet. These uniforms were worn for their 2024 Winter Whiteout game against the Bears.

==Team culture==

===Mascots===
After several failed attempts at developing an official team-owned mascot, the Vikings finally introduced Viktor the Viking during the 2007 Vikings&#x27; season. Team officials had long indicated that they were after a mascot concept that would primarily appeal to the team&#x27;s younger fan base. Viktor the Viking, a muscle-bound, blond-haired and mustachioed character, wears a Vikings&#x27; #1 jersey and an oversized Vikings helmet with protruding horns and a small yellow nose guard.

From 1970 to 1992, truck driver Hub Meeds dressed as a Viking and served as the team mascot. Meeds asked to become the mascot after being accidentally let onto the field by security during Super Bowl IV in New Orleans.

From 1994 to 2015, the team mascot was Ragnar (played by Joseph Juranitch) and was based on the legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok. Juranitch admits to being somewhat of an eccentric—he holds the current world record for fastest time shaving a beard with an axe, but hasn&#x27;t shaved his beard since he won the Ragnar job among 3,000 applicants. Ragnar drove onto the field at the beginning of a game dressed in Viking garb, on a motorcycle, while a cheerleader used to ride a snowmobile. Although never one to shy away from confrontations with opposing players, notably Chad &quot;Ochocinco&quot; Johnson, he had a soft spot for Brett Favre while the quarterback started for the rival Green Bay Packers. In 2015, the Vikings announced that they were not able to reach a new contract agreement with Juranitch which he wanted $20,000 per game, and released him.

Another mascot associated with the Vikings was &quot;Vikadontis Rex&quot;, a purple foam dinosaur. Vikadontis was the official mascot of the Minnesota Vikings Children&#x27;s Fund and took part in the 1995 Celebrity Mascot Olympics. Vikadontis was retired starting with the 2000 season. The team also had an NFL Huddles mascot in the mid-1980s (somewhat similar to Viktor the Viking). Krazy George Henderson was also employed as a cheerleader from 1982 to 1985.

===Fight song===

&quot;Skol, Vikings&quot; is the fight song of the Minnesota Vikings. It was introduced around the time the team was founded in 1961. It is always played whenever the team scores a touchdown, field goal or safety, at the end of each half, and upon victory.

The song &quot;Purple and Gold&quot; was recorded in 2010 by Minneapolis native Prince to be used as a fight song for the Minnesota Vikings.

===Helga hats===
Vikings fans are known to dress up in &quot;Helga hats&quot;, purple hats with white horns and blonde braids, mimicking the helmets popularly believed to have been worn by Viking warriors. The original Helga Hats are still hand assembled in the Twin Cities area.

===Vikings horn===

During home games, the Vikings&#x27; Gjallarhorn is played during its pre-game ceremonies, a tradition that started in 2007. The ceremony has been an opportunity to honor past Viking greats (most notably Randy Moss) along with Minnesota-related folks (such as the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men&#x27;s ice hockey team when they won the NCAA hockey championship). The first horn broke right before the playing of the 2016 playoff game in Minnesota versus the Seattle Seahawks, owing to below-zero temperatures (at the time, the Vikings were playing at Huntington Bank Stadium, an outdoor stadium) that cracked it. Both the first and second horns were created by Todd Johnson, a general manager at a music store.

===Skol Chant===
The Skol Chant is a cheer that is used in U.S. Bank Stadium for Minnesota Vikings games. It involves fans clapping their hands above their heads and yelling &quot;Skol&quot;, in response to the beat of a drum. The chant is a modified take on the Viking War Cry used at the Iceland national football team&#x27;s games and popularized by Iceland supporters at UEFA Euro 2016.

&quot;Skol&quot; (written &quot;skål&quot; in Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish and &quot;skál&quot; in Faroese and Icelandic or &quot;skaal&quot; in archaic spellings or transliteration of any of those languages) is the Danish–Norwegian–Swedish word for &quot;cheers&quot; or &quot;good health&quot;, a salute or a toast, as to an admired person or group.

==Rivalries==
===Divisional===
====Chicago Bears====

The Vikings&#x27; rivalry with the Chicago Bears began when the Vikings entered the league as an expansion team in 1961. The first time these two teams met, the Vikings managed an upset over the Bears 37–13 in Minnesota. Both teams are members of the NFC North, and play at least twice a year. The Vikings lead the overall series 65–57–2. The teams have met once in the postseason, a 35–18 Bears win in the 1994 Wild Card Round.

====Detroit Lions====

The Vikings and Detroit Lions have played twice annually since the Vikings entered the league&#x27;s Western Conference in 1961. The two teams moved to the NFC Central after the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, which became the NFC North after the NFL&#x27;s 2002 realignment. This is the only NFC North rivalry without any head-to-head postseason meetings. The Vikings lead the all-time series 80–41–2.

====Green Bay Packers====

The rivalry between the Vikings and the Green Bay Packers began in 1961, similarly to their other divisional rivalries. Much like other Minnesota-Wisconsin sports rivalries, such as that between the Wisconsin Badgers and Minnesota Golden Gophers. It is also considered to be the most widely acknowledged rivalry within NFC North. Events such as Randy Moss mooning the Green Bay crowd in the first playoff game between these two teams (won by the Vikings), and former Packer great Brett Favre&#x27;s move to the Vikings have created more resentment between these teams. The Packers lead the all-time series 66–60–3, despite the two teams splitting their two playoff contests.

===Conference===
====New Orleans Saints====

The Vikings have developed a heated NFC rivalry with the New Orleans Saints, who have become known as the Vikings&#x27; biggest out-of-division rival. The Vikings lead the overall series 23–13, including 4–1 in the playoffs. This rivalry has featured many notable playoff matchups, such as the 2009 NFC Championship Game and the 2017 NFC Divisional Round game.

===Historic===
====Dallas Cowboys====

The rivalry between the Cowboys and the Vikings heated up during the 1970s, with several of their games impacting the NFC playoff race during that decade. The Cowboys lead the all-time series 19–15, including a 4–3 record against the Vikings in the playoffs.

====Los Angeles Rams====

The Vikings&#x27; rivalry with the Los Angeles Rams was most heated in the 1970s when the two teams faced off in many consequential playoff games. To-date, the Vikings are the Rams&#x27; second most played playoff opponent with seven games, and the Rams are tied with the Cowboys as the most played playoff opponent for the Vikings.
The Vikings lead the all-time series 27–18–1 and are 5–2 in the playoffs.

===Current staff===
==Radio and television==

The Vikings&#x27; flagship radio station is KFXN-FM (100.3), which uses the branding &quot;KFAN&quot; based on its former calls on 1130 AM before a format flip between the AM and FM stations before the 2011 season; 1130 AM also continues to broadcast game play-by-play as KTLK.

The games are also heard on the &quot;KFAN Radio Network&quot; in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, and North Dakota, as well as many other outlets. Paul Allen has been the play-by-play announcer since the 2002 NFL season with Pete Bercich filling in as analyst, who began his first season in 2007.

Telecasts of preseason games not shown on national networks are aired on KMSP (Channel 9) in the Twin Cities with a simulcast of KFAN&#x27;s radio broadcast while Fox Sports North shows a tape delay later.

<text>Mixmaster Morris (born Morris Gould; 30 December 1960) is an English electronica DJ and underground musician who has also recorded as The Irresistible Force. His work in the 1990s blended ambient music and chill-out influences with UK dance styles.

==Life and career==
Morris Gould was born in Brighton, Sussex, England, but grew up in Lincolnshire and was educated at Millfield in Somerset, and King&#x27;s College London. At 15 he founded a punk rock band, The Ripchords, whose sole release, an eponymous EP with four tracks, was championed by the BBC Radio One DJ John Peel. After leaving university, he began working as a DJ in 1985 with his &quot;Mongolian Hip Hop Show&quot; on pirate radio station Network 21 in London – the handle Mixmaster Morris was suggested by the station director. After a year of managing a club called &quot;The Gift&quot; in New Cross, which had been founded by Keith Gallagher and named after a Velvet Underground song, Morris began releasing material as The Irresistible Force in 1987 in collaboration with singer-songwriter Des de Moor. He became involved with the emerging UK acid house scene, after organising Madhouse at The Fridge, Brixton in 1988 – which was the subject of a piece by Peel in &quot;The Observer&quot;.

A show with the band Psychic TV led to him becoming full-time DJ with The Shamen, and touring with them on their &#x27;Synergy&#x27; tours for nearly two years.

The first release as The Irresistible Force was the single, &quot;I Want To&quot; (1988), but success came with the first album, &quot;Flying High&quot;, released in 1992 on Rising High Records. In 1994, Morris released the second album &quot;Global Chillage&quot; which featured a holographic sleeve, and was released in the US on Astralwerks. After a period of legal problems, the third album &quot;It&#x27;s Tomorrow Already&quot; came out on Ninja Tune.

In 1990, he made one of the first chillout compilations, &quot;Give Peace a Dance 2: The Ambient Collection&quot; for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, followed by the series &quot;Chillout or Die&quot; for Rising High Records. A mix tape for &quot;Mixmag&quot; shared with Alex Patterson was also released as a CD. &quot;The Morning After&quot; became his first major-label mix album, followed by &quot;Abstract Funk Theory&quot; for Obsessive.

Through the 1990s he was a regular DJ in the chill out room at Return to the Source parties in London, around the UK and abroad. In 2003 he released the mix CD &quot;God Bless the Chilled&quot; for the Return to the Source Ambient Meditations series.

He has produced many remixes since 1985, including Coldcut&#x27;s &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;. This remix was nominated by Norman Cook as his favourite chillout track on BBC Television. His mix for INXS was a Top 20 hit in the UK. Other early remixes were of Lloyd Cole, Dave Howard Singers, Bang Bang Machine, Stump, Higher Intelligence Agency, Sven Väth and Rising High Collective.

In the early 1990s his key residencies were alongside the Detroit masters at Lost, Megatripolis at London&#x27;s Heaven, and also the Tribal Gathering parties. He became known for wearing holographic suits, produced by the company Spacetime, which he modelled for &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine. Throughout the decade, Morris wrote about electronic music for the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Mixmag&quot;, and &quot;i-D&quot;. He was resident on Kiss FM for several years, and then a regular on Solid Steel, the Ninja Tune syndicated radio show. He made his film debut in &quot;Modulations&quot; (Caipirinha Films), and his music was used in a number of other films including &quot;Groove&quot; and &quot;Hey Happy&quot;.

Morris has played in over fifty countries at nightclubs and parties, and particularly music festivals such as the Full Moon parties in the Mojave Desert, Glastonbury Festival, Rainbow 2000 and Mother SOS in Japan, Chillits in Northern California, and Berlin&#x27;s Love Parade. He also ran the downtempo night Nubient in Brixton. In 1995, he played at the first The Big Chill festival, and then became a resident for the next 16 years.

He also collaborated with the German musician Pete Namlook under the name Dreamfish, recording two albums. Also with SF-based musician Jonah Sharp and Haruomi Hosono of Yellow Magic Orchestra he made the album &quot;Quiet Logic&quot; for the Japanese label Daisyworld.

In 1998 he joined the UK&#x27;s Ninja Tune record label, with whom he toured as a DJ and made three releases. 1999 saw him win &#x27;Best Chillout DJ&#x27; at the Ibiza DJ Awards at Pacha, Ibiza, and in 2001 he won the title for a second time, becoming the first DJ to achieve this. He has appeared in many lists of the world&#x27;s top DJ&#x27;s including the Ministry of Sound book &quot;The Annual&quot; and 2003&#x27;s &quot;DJs by Lopez&quot;, and &quot;URB Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 DJ list. Morris records regular radio shows for the Japanese internet radio station Samurai FM. In 2006 he started a new club at the Big Chill House in Kings Cross, London, and did a guest mix for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Room&quot; show. His essay about jazz was published in the book, &quot;Crossfade&quot;, and he made a one-off appearance reading it aloud.

In March 2007, together with Coldcut, he organised a tribute show to the writer and philosopher Robert Anton Wilson, which they performed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. He also played in Goa for the first time with The Big Chill, and started a new residency at The Prince in Brixton. In May 2008 Morris undertook an ambient mix on BBC Radio 1, and put a The Irresistible Force band together to play at The Big Chill festival. In 2009, he compiled a podcast for Tate Britain to accompany their Altermodern exhibition, and opened a new AV night called MMMTV in Camden. The mix CD, &quot;Calm Down My Selector&quot; was released in January by Wakyo Records, and he made a tour of Japan to promote it.

In 2010, he won another Ibiza DJ Award, for the third time. In October that year, he was announced as Head of A+R for Apollo Records. 2011 saw him rejoin Bestival as part of their &quot;Ambient Forest&quot; team.

2017 saw Morris continue to stay at the top of the psybient/downtempo movement and charts, especially Mixcloud where he held top positions in most categories relating to ambient music for the full year. 2017 also saw the triumphant return of Mixmaster Morris with his acclaimed release &quot;Kira Kira&quot;, a lush soundscape that was received well by many publications and listeners and earned a spot in &quot;Extreme Chill&#x27;s&quot; top twenty of 2017 along with releases by Brian Eno and Steve Roach.

<doc id="20143" wikidata="Q12175" url="?curid=20143" title="Manx language">
<text>Manx ( or , or ), also known as Manx Gaelic, is a Gaelic language of the insular Celtic branch of the Celtic language family, itself a branch of the Indo-European language family. Manx is the heritage language of the Manx people.

Although few children native to the Isle of Man speak Manx as a first language, there has been a steady increase in the number of speakers since the death of Ned Maddrell in 1974. He was considered to be the last speaker to grow up in a Manx-speaking community environment. Despite this, the language has never fallen completely out of use, with a minority having some knowledge of it as a heritage language, and it is still an important part of the island&#x27;s culture and cultural heritage.

Manx is often cited as a good example of language revitalization efforts; in 2015, around 1,800 people had varying levels of second-language conversational ability. Since the late 20th century, Manx has become more visible on the island, with increased signage, radio broadcasts and a Manx-medium primary school. The revival of Manx has been made easier because the language was well recorded, e.g. the Bible and the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; had been translated into Manx, and audio recordings had been made of native speakers.

==Names==

===In Manx===
The endonym of the language is /, which shares the same etymology as the word &quot;Gaelic&quot;, as do the endonyms of its sister languages: Irish (; , and ) and Scottish Gaelic (). Manx frequently uses the forms / (with definite article), as do Irish () and Scottish Gaelic ().

To distinguish it from the two other forms of Gaelic, the phrases &quot;Gaelic of Mann&quot; and &quot;Manx Gaelic&quot; are also used. In addition, the nickname &quot;the mother tongue&quot;, lit. &quot;the mother&#x27;s tongue&quot; is occasionally used.

===In English===
The language is usually referred to in English as &quot;Manx&quot;. The term &quot;Manx Gaelic&quot; is often used, for example when discussing the relationship between the three Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx) or to avoid confusion with Manx English, the form of English spoken on the island. A feature of Manx English deriving from Gaelic is the use of the definite article, e.g. &quot;the Manx&quot;, &quot;the Gaelic&quot;, in ways not generally seen in standard English.

The word &quot;Manx&quot;, often spelled historically as &quot;Manks&quot; (particularly by natives of the island), means &quot;Mannish&quot; and originates from Old Norse . The Isle of Man is named after the Irish god Manannán mac Lir, thus (&quot;Mannanán&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;Mannanán&#x27;s Island&quot;).

== History ==

Manx is a Goidelic language, closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic. On the whole it is partially mutually intelligible with these, and native speakers of one find it easy to gain passive, and even spoken, competency in the other two.

It has been suggested that a little-documented Brythonic language (i.e. related to modern Welsh, Cornish and Breton) may have been spoken on the Isle of Man before the arrival of Christian missionaries from Ireland in the early Middle Ages. However, there is little surviving evidence about the language spoken on the island at that time.

The basis of the modern Manx language is Primitive Irish (like modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic). The island either lends its name to or takes its name from &quot;Manannán&quot;, the Brythonic and Gaelic sea god who is said in myth to have once ruled the island. Primitive Irish is first attested in Ogham inscriptions from the 4th century AD. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain. Primitive Irish transitioned into Old Irish through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the Latin script and is attested primarily in marginalia to Latin manuscripts, but there are no extant examples from the Isle of Man.

Latin was used for ecclesiastical records from the establishment of Christianity in the Isle of Man in the 5th century AD. Many lexical items concerning religion, writing and record keeping entered Manx at this time.

The Isle of Man was conquered by Norse Vikings in the 9th century. Although there is some evidence in the form of runic inscriptions that Norse was used by some of these settlers, the Vikings who settled around the Irish Sea and West Coast of Scotland soon became Gaelic speaking Norse–Gaels. During the 9th century AD, the Gaelic of the inhabitants of the Isle of Man, like those of Scotland and the North of Ireland, may have been significantly influenced by Norse speakers. While Norse had very little impact on the Manx language overall, a small number of modern place names on the Isle of Man are Norse in origin, e.g. Laxey (Laksaa) and Ramsey (Rhumsaa). Other Norse legacies in Manx include loanwords and personal names.

By the 10th century, it is supposed that Middle Irish had emerged and was spoken throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man.

The island came under Scottish rule in 1266, and alternated between Scottish and English rule until finally becoming the feudal possession of the Stanley family in 1405. It is likely that until that point, except for scholarly knowledge of Latin and courtly use of Anglo-Norman, Manx was the only language spoken on the island. Since the establishment of the Stanleys on the Isle of Man, first Anglo-Norman and later the English language have been the chief external factors in the development of Manx, until the 20th century, when Manx speakers became able to access Irish and Scottish Gaelic media.

===17th to 19th centuries===
Manx had diverged considerably from the Gaelic languages of Scotland and Ireland between 1400 and 1900. The 17th century Plantation of Ulster, the decline of Irish in Leinster and the extinction of Galloway Gaelic led to the geographic isolation of Manx from other dialects of Gaelic. The development of a separate orthography also led Manx to diverge from Irish and Scottish Gaelic.

In the 17th century, some university students left the Isle of Man to attend school in England. At the same time, teaching in English was required in schools founded by governor Isaac Barrow. Barrow also promoted the use of English in churches; he considered that it was a superior language for reading the Bible; however, because the majority of ministers were monolingual Manx speakers, his views had little practical impact.

Thomas Wilson began his tenure as Bishop of Mann in 1698 and was succeeded by Mark Hildesley. Both men held positive views of Manx; Wilson was the first person to publish a book in Manx, a translation of &quot;The Principles and Duties of Christianity&quot; (), and Hildesley successfully promoted the use of Manx as the language of instruction in schools. The New Testament was first published in Manx in 1767. In the late 18th century, nearly every school was teaching in English. This decline continued into the 19th century, as English gradually became the primary language spoken on the Isle of Man.

In 1848, J.G. Cumming wrote, &quot;there are ... few persons (perhaps none of the young) who speak no English.&quot; Henry Jenner estimated in 1874 that about 30% of the population habitually spoke Manx (12,340 out of a population of 41,084). According to official census figures, 9.1% of the population claimed to speak Manx in 1901; in 1921 the percentage was only 1.1%. Since the language was used by so few people, it had low linguistic &quot;prestige&quot;, and parents tended not to teach Manx to their children, thinking it would be useless to them compared with English.

According to Brian Stowell, &quot;In the 1860s there were thousands of Manx people who couldn&#x27;t speak English, but barely a century later it was considered to be so backwards to speak the language that there were stories of Manx speakers getting stones thrown at them in the towns.&quot;

=== Revival ===
Following the decline in the use of Manx during the 19th century, (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899. By the middle of the 20th century, only a few elderly native speakers remained (the last of them, Ned Maddrell, died on 27 December 1974), but by then a scholarly revival had begun and a few people had started teaching it in schools. The Manx Language Unit was formed in 1992, consisting of three members and headed by Manx Language Officer Brian Stowell, a language activist and fluent speaker, &quot;which was put in charge of all aspects of Manx language teaching and accreditation in schools.&quot; This led to an increased interest in studying the Manx language and encouraged a renewed sense of ethnic identity. The revival of Manx was aided by the recording work done in the 20th century by researchers. Most notably, the Irish Folklore Commission was sent in with recording equipment in 1948 by Éamon de Valera. Also important in preserving the Manx language was work conducted by the late Brian Stowell, who is considered personally responsible for the current revival of the Manx language. The Manx Language Strategy was released in 2017, outlining a five-year plan for the language&#x27;s continued revitalisation. Culture Vannin employs a Manx Language Development Officer () to encourage and facilitate the use of the language.

In 2009, UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot; declared Manx an extinct language, despite the presence of hundreds of speakers on the Isle of Man. Historian and linguist Jennifer Kewley Draskau reacted to this declaration, saying that saying that &quot;Unesco ought to know better than to declare Manx a dead language. There are hundreds of speakers of Manx and while people are able to have productive conversations in the language then it is very much alive and well.&quot; Since then, UNESCO&#x27;s classification of the language has changed to &quot;critically endangered&quot;. 

In the 2011 census, 1,823 out of 80,398 Isle of Man residents, or 2.27% of the population, claimed to have knowledge of Manx, an increase of 134 people from the 2001 census. These individuals were spread roughly uniformly over the island: in Douglas 566 people professed an ability to speak, read or write Manx; 179 in Peel, 146 in Onchan, and 149 in Ramsey.

Traditional Manx given names have experienced a marked resurgence on the island, especially and (Mary), (William), (from the Manx king Godred Crovan of Norse origin), (Bridget), (Alice), (Jack), (John), (Joan), (Fionnuala), (Patrick) and (from the Norse goddess) remain popular.

=== Estimated number of speakers by year ===


== Status ==

Manx is not officially recognised by any national or regional government, although its contribution to Manx culture and tradition is acknowledged by some governmental and non-governmental bodies.

The Standing Orders of the House of Keys provide that: &quot;The proceedings of the House shall be in English; but if a Member at any point pronounces a customary term or sentence in Manx Gaelic or any other language, the Speaker may call upon the Member for a translation.&quot; An example was at the sitting on 12 February 2019, when an MHK used the expression , stated to mean &quot;nonsense&quot;.

Manx is used in the annual Tynwald ceremony and Manx words are used in official Tynwald publications.

For the purpose of strengthening its contribution to local culture and community, Manx is recognised under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and in the framework of the British-Irish Council.

The Isle of Man comprised the one site for the Manx language in the Atlas Linguarum Europae, a project that compared dialects and languages across all countries in Europe.

Manx is taught as a second language at all of the island&#x27;s primary and secondary schools. The lessons are optional and instruction is provided by the Department of Education&#x27;s Manx Language Team which teach up to A Level standard.

The Bunscoill Ghaelgagh, a primary school at St John&#x27;s, has 67 children, as of September 2016, who receive nearly all of their education through the medium of the language. Children who have attended the school have the opportunity to receive some of their secondary education through the language at Queen Elizabeth II High School in Peel.

The playgroup organisation Mooinjer Veggey, which operates the , runs a series of preschool groups that introduce the language.
Bilingual road, street, village and town boundary signs are common throughout the Isle of Man. All other road signs are in English only.

Business signage in Manx is gradually being introduced but is not mandated by law; however, the 1985 Tynwald Report on the use of Manx states that signage should be bilingual except where a Manx phrase is the norm.

== Classification and dialects ==

Manx is one of the three daughter languages of Old Irish (via Middle Irish), the other two being Irish and Scottish Gaelic. It shares a number of developments in phonology, vocabulary and grammar with its sisters (in some cases only with certain dialects) and shows a number of unique changes. There are two attested historical dialects of Manx, Northern Manx and Southern Manx. A third dialect may have existed in-between, around Douglas.

===Similarities to and differences from Irish and Scottish Gaelic===

Manx and Scottish Gaelic share the partial loss of phonemic palatalisation of labial consonants; while in Irish velarised consonants contrast phonemically with palatalised . A consequence of this phonemic merger is that Middle Irish unstressed word-final (- in Irish and Gaelic) has merged with (- in Irish and Gaelic), in Manx; both have become (-), e.g. &quot;to stand&quot; (Irish ), &quot;religion&quot; (Irish ), &quot;fainting&quot; (Early Modern Irish , lit. &quot;in clouds&quot;), and &quot;on you (pl.)&quot; (Irish ).

Medial and final * have generally become and in Manx, thus &#x27;you pl.&#x27; (Irish and Scottish Gaelic ; Lewis Gaelic ), &quot;bitter&quot; (Scottish , Irish (Northern/Western) , (Southern) ), &quot;river&quot; (Scottish , Irish (Northern) ) (Western) (Southern) , &quot;hand&quot; (Scottish , Irish (Northern) , (Western) , (Southern) ), &quot;summer&quot; (Scottish , Irish (Northern) , (Western/Southern) ). Rare retentions of the older pronunciation of include , &quot;Dublin&quot;, Middle Irish &quot;Duibhlind&quot; .

Moreover, similarly to Munster Irish, historical () and (nasalised ) tend to be lost word medially or finally in Manx, either with compensatory lengthening or vocalisation as resulting in diphthongisation with the preceding vowel, e.g. &quot;winter&quot; (Irish (Southern) ) and &quot;mountains&quot; (Irish (Southern) ). Another similarity to Munster Irish is the development of the Old Irish diphthongs before velarised consonants ( in Irish and Scottish Gaelic) to , as in &quot;carpenter&quot; and &quot;narrow&quot; (Irish and Scottish and ).

Like Connacht and Ulster Irish (cf. Irish phonology) and most dialects of Scottish Gaelic, Manx has changed the historical consonant clusters to , e.g. Middle Irish &quot;mockery&quot; and &quot;women&quot; have become and respectively in Manx. The affrication of slender &quot;&quot; sounds is also common to Manx, Northern Irish, and Scottish Gaelic.

Unstressed Middle Irish word-final syllable (-) has developed to (-) in Manx, as in &quot;buy&quot; (cf. Irish ) and &quot;apparatus&quot; (cf. Gaelic ), like Northern/Western Irish and Southern dialects Scottish Gaelic (e.g. Arran, Kintyre).

Another property Manx shares with Ulster Irish and some dialects of Scottish Gaelic is that rather than appears in unstressed syllables before ( in Manx), e.g. &quot;straight&quot; (Irish ), &quot;to remember&quot; (Scottish Gaelic ).

Like Southern and Western Irish and Northern Scottish Gaelic, but unlike the geographically closer varieties of Ulster Irish and Arran and Kintyre Gaelic, Manx shows vowel lengthening or diphthongisation before the Old Irish fortis and lenis sonorants, e.g. &quot;children&quot; , &quot;brown&quot; and &quot;butter&quot; correspond to Irish/Scottish Gaelic , , and respectively, which have long vowels or diphthongs in Western and Southern Irish and in the Scottish Gaelic dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Skye, thus Western Irish , Southern Irish/Northern Scottish , , ), but short vowels and &#x27;long&#x27; consonants in Ulster Irish, Arran, and Kintyre, , and .

Another similarity with Southern Irish is the treatment of Middle Irish word-final unstressed (- in Irish and Scottish Gaelic). In nouns (including verbal nouns), this became in Manx, as it did in Southern Irish, e.g. &quot;war&quot; , &quot;to praise&quot; (cf. Irish and (Southern Irish) and ). In finite verb forms before full nouns (as opposed to pronouns) became in Manx, as in Southern Irish, e.g. &quot;would praise&quot; (cf. Irish (Southern Irish) ).

===Dialects===

Linguistic analysis of the last few dozen native speakers reveals a number of dialectal differences between the North and the South of the island. Northern Manx () was spoken from Maughold in the northeast to Peel on the west coast. Southern Manx was spoken in the sheading of Rushen. It is possible that written Manx represents a &#x27;midlands&#x27; dialect of Douglas and surrounding areas.

In Southern Manx, older , and in some cases , became . In Northern Manx the same happened, but sometimes remained as well, e.g. &quot;day&quot; (cf. Irish ) was in the South but or in the North. Old is always in both dialects, e.g. &quot;young&quot; (cf. Irish ) is in both dialects. and lengthened before became , as in &quot;paayrt&quot; &#x27;&quot;part&quot; , &quot;ard&quot; &quot;high&quot; , &quot;jiarg&quot; &quot;red&quot; , &quot;argid&quot; &quot;money, silver&quot; and &quot;aarey&quot; &quot;gold gen.&quot; .

In Northern Manx, older before in the same syllable is diphthongised, while in Southern Manx it is lengthened but remains a monophthong, e.g. &quot;head&quot; (cf. Irish ) is in the North but in the South.

Words with , and in some cases , in Irish and Scottish are spelled with in Manx. In Northern Manx, this sound was , while in Southern Manx it was , , or , e.g. &quot;wind&quot; (cf. Irish ) is in the north and in the South, while &quot;coal&quot; (cf. Irish ) is in the North and , , or in the South.

In both the North and the South, there is a tendency to insert a short before a word-final in monosyllabic words, as in for &quot;whole&quot; and for &quot;woman&quot;. This is known as pre-occlusion. In Southern Manx, however, there is also pre-occlusion of before and of before , as in for &quot;walking&quot; and for &quot;ship&quot;. These forms are generally pronounced without pre-occlusion in the North. Pre-occlusion of before , on the other hand, is more common in the North, as in &quot;heavy&quot;, which is in the North but in the South. This feature is also found in Cornish.

Southern Manx tended to lose word-initial before , which was usually preserved in the North, e.g. &quot;glen&quot; and &quot;knee&quot; are and and in the South but and in the North.

In modern times, the small size of the island and the improvement in communications precludes any regional dialect variations.
==Phonology==
=== Stress ===
Stress generally falls on the first syllable of a word in Manx, but in many cases, stress is attracted to a long vowel in the second syllable. Examples include:
* &quot;sprite&quot;
* &quot;busy&quot;

=== Consonants ===
The consonant phoneme inventory of Manx:

The voiceless plosives are aspirated. The dental, postalveolar and palato-velar plosives affricate to in many contexts.

Manx has an optional process of lenition of plosives between vowels, where voiced plosives and voiceless fricatives become voiced fricatives and voiceless plosives become either voiced plosives or voiced fricatives. This process introduces the allophones . The voiced fricative may be further lenited to , and may disappear altogether. Examples include:

Voiceless plosive to voiced plosive:
* &gt; : &quot;flag, rag&quot;
* &gt; : &quot;sin&quot;
Voiceless plosive to voiced fricative:
* &gt; : &quot;cup&quot;
* &gt; : &quot;boat&quot;
* &gt; : &quot;tooth&quot;
Voiced plosive to voiced fricative:
* &gt; : &quot;horse&quot;
* &gt; : &quot;face&quot;
* &gt; : &quot;prayer&quot;
* &gt; &gt; : &quot;stick&quot;
* &gt; : &quot;born&quot;
Voiceless fricative to voiced fricative:
* &gt; or : &quot;married&quot;
* &gt; : &quot;stand&quot;
* &gt; : &quot;easy&quot;
* &gt; &gt; : &quot;beginning&quot;
* &gt; : &quot;live&quot;
* &gt; &gt; ∅: &quot;past&quot;

Another optional process is pre-occlusion, the insertion of a very short plosive before a sonorant consonant. In Manx, this applies to stressed monosyllabic words. The inserted consonant is homorganic with the following sonorant, which means it has the same place of articulation. Long vowels are often shortened before pre-occluded sounds. Examples include:
* &gt; : &gt; &quot;heavy&quot;
* &gt; : &gt; &quot;head&quot;
* &gt; : &gt; &quot;birds&quot;
* &gt; : &gt; &quot;ship&quot;
* &gt; : &gt; &quot;walking&quot;

The trill is realised as a one- or two-contact flap at the beginning of syllable, and as a stronger trill when preceded by another consonant in the same syllable. At the end of a syllable, can be pronounced either as a strong trill or, more frequently, as a weak fricative , which may vocalise to a nonsyllabic or disappear altogether. This vocalisation may be due to the influence of Manx English, which is non-rhotic. Examples of the pronunciation of include:
* &quot;snare&quot; 
* &quot;bread&quot; 
* &quot;big&quot; 

===Vowels===
The vowel phoneme inventory of Manx:

The status of and as separate phonemes is debatable, but is suggested by the allophony of certain words such as &quot;is&quot;, &quot;women&quot;, and so on. An alternative analysis is that Manx has the following system, where the vowels and have allophones ranging from through to . As with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, there is a large amount of vowel allophony, such as that of . This depends mainly on the &#x27;broad&#x27; and &#x27;slender&#x27; status of the neighbouring consonants:

When stressed, is realised as .

Manx has a relatively large number of diphthongs, all of them falling:
==Grammar==
=== Syntax ===

Like most Insular Celtic languages, Manx is a VSO language. However, most finite verbs are formed periphrastically, using an auxiliary verb in conjunction with the verbal noun. In this case, only the auxiliary verb precedes the subject, while the verbal noun comes after the subject. The auxiliary verb may be a modal verb rather than a form of (&quot;be&quot;) or (&quot;do&quot;). Particles like the negative (&quot;not&quot;) precede the inflected verb. Examples:



When the auxiliary verb is a form of (&quot;do&quot;), the direct object precedes the verbal noun and is connected to it with the particle :

As in Irish (cf. Irish syntax#The forms meaning &quot;to be&quot;), there are two ways of expressing &quot;to be&quot; in Manx: with the substantive verb , and with the copula. The substantive verb is used when the predicate is an adjective, adverb, or prepositional phrase. Examples:



Where the predicate is a noun, it must be converted to a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition (&quot;in&quot;) + possessive pronoun (agreeing with the subject) in order for the substantive verb to be grammatical:

Otherwise, the copula is used when the predicate is a noun. The copula itself takes the form or in the present tense, but it is often omitted in affirmative statements:

In questions and negative sentences, the present tense of the copula is :

=== Morphology ===
==== Initial consonant mutations ====
Like all modern Celtic languages, Manx shows initial consonant mutations, which are processes by which the initial consonant of a word is altered according to its morphological and/or syntactic environment. Manx has two mutations: lenition and eclipsis, found on nouns and verbs in a variety of environments; adjectives can undergo lenition but not eclipsis. In the late spoken language of the 20th century the system was breaking down, with speakers frequently failing to use mutation in environments where it was called for, and occasionally using it in environments where it was not called for.


In the corpus of the late spoken language, there is also one example of the eclipsis (nasalisation) of : the sentence (&quot;I have found the lamb&quot;), where is pronounced . However, probably this was a mis-transcription; the verbal noun in this case is not &quot;get, fetch&quot;, but rather &quot;find&quot;.

==== Nouns ====
Manx nouns display gender, number and sometimes case, for instance, for feminine &quot;foot&quot;.

==== Pronouns ====
In addition to regular forms, personal pronouns also have emphatic versions.

==== Verbs ====
Manx verbs generally form their finite forms by means of periphrasis: inflected forms of the auxiliary verbs &quot;to be&quot; or &quot;to do&quot; are combined with the verbal noun of the main verb. Only the future, conditional, preterite, and imperative can be formed directly by inflecting the main verb, but even in these tenses, the periphrastic formation is more common in Late Spoken Manx.

The fully inflected forms of the regular verb &quot;to throw&quot; are as follows. In addition to the forms below, a past participle may be formed using : &quot;thrown&quot;.

1. First person singular, making the use of a following subject pronoun redundant

2. First person plural, making the use of a following subject pronoun redundant

3. Used with all other persons, meaning an accompanying subject must be stated, e.g. &quot;he will throw&quot;, &quot;they will throw&quot;

4. Singular subject.

5. Plural subject.

There are a few peculiarities when a verb begins with a vowel, i.e. the addition of in the preterite and in the future and conditional dependent. Below is the conjugation of &quot;to grow&quot;.

There is a small number of irregular verbs, the most irregular of all being &quot;be&quot;.
==== Prepositions ====
Like the other Insular Celtic languages, Manx has inflected prepositions, contractions of a preposition with a pronominal direct object, as the following common prepositions show. Note the sometimes identical form of the uninflected preposition and its third person singular masculine inflected form.

====Numbers====
Numbers are traditionally vigesimal in Manx, e.g. &quot;twenty&quot;, &quot;forty&quot; (&quot;two twenties&quot;), &quot;sixty&quot; (&quot;three twenties&quot;).

*In the northern dialects of Irish may be affricated to or .

== Orthography ==
Manx orthography is based on Elizabethan English, and to a lesser extent Middle Welsh, developed by people who had an education in English (and Welsh until the 16th century). The result is an inconsistent and only partially phonemic spelling system, similar to English orthography and completely incomprehensible to readers of Irish and Scottish Gaelic. This is because both Irish and Scottish Gaelic use spelling systems derived from Classical Gaelic, the common literary language of Man, Ireland, and Scotland until the Bardic schools closed down in the 17th century, which makes them very etymological. Both Irish and Scottish Gaelic use only 18 letters to represent around 50 phonemes. While Manx uses 24 letters (the ISO basic Latin alphabet, excluding and ), covering a similar range of phonemes, all three make use of many digraphs and trigraphs. In 1932, Celticist T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly expressed the opinion that Manx orthography is inadequate, as it is neither traditional nor phonetic. Therefore, if a form of Classical Gaelic orthography adapted to Manx had survived or if one based on the reforms of Theobald Stapleton were to be developed and introduced, the very close relationship between Manx, Irish, and Scottish Gaelic would be obvious to readers at first sight and Manx would be much easier for other Gaels to read and understand.

There is no evidence, however, of Gaelic type ever having been used on the island.

=== Spelling to sound correspondences ===


=== Diacritics ===
Manx uses only one diacritic, a cedilla, which is (optionally) used to differentiate between the two phonemes represented by :
* () &quot;lord&quot;, is pronounced with , as in the English &quot;church&quot;
* () &quot;nor&quot; or &quot;neither&quot;, is pronounced with , as in Scottish English &quot;loch&quot; () or Irish English &quot;lough&quot; (), a sound commonly represented by at the ends of words in Manx (and Irish English).

===Example===
The following examples are taken from Broderick 1984–86, 1:178–79 and 1:350–53. The first example is from a speaker of Northern Manx, the second from Ned Maddrell, a speaker of Southern Manx.

== Vocabulary ==
Manx vocabulary is predominantly of Goidelic origin, derived from Old Irish and has cognates in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. However, Manx itself, as well as the languages from which it is derived, borrowed words from other languages, especially Latin, Old Norse, French (particularly Anglo-Norman), and English (both Middle English and Modern English).

The following table shows a selection of nouns from the Swadesh list and indicates their pronunciations and etymologies.

See for the complete list in all the Celtic languages.

=== Phrases ===
=== Loanwords ===
Loanwords are primarily Norse and English, with a smaller number coming from French. Some examples of Norse loanwords are &quot;garden&quot; (from &quot;enclosure&quot;) and &quot;sea rock&quot; (from ). Examples of French loanwords are &quot;danger&quot; (from ) and &quot;advantage&quot; (from ).

English loanwords were common in late (pre-revival) Manx, e.g. &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;badger&quot;, rather than the more usual native Gaelic and . In more recent years, there has been a reaction against such borrowing, resulting in coinages for technical vocabulary. Despite this, calques exist in Manx, not necessarily obvious to its speakers. To fill gaps in recorded Manx vocabulary, revivalists have referred to modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic for words and inspiration.

Some religious terms come ultimately from Latin, Greek and Hebrew, e.g. &quot;holy&quot; (from Latin ), &quot;church&quot; (from Greek / &quot;assembly&quot;) and &quot;abbot&quot; (from Hebrew / &quot;father&quot;). These did not necessarily come directly into Manx, but via Old Irish. In more recent times, has been borrowed from modern Hebrew. Many Irish and English loanwords also have a classical origin, e.g. &quot;television&quot; (Irish ) and &quot;telephone&quot;. Foreign language words (usually via English) are used occasionally especially for ethnic food, e.g. chorizo and spaghetti.

Going in the other direction, Manx Gaelic has influenced Manx English (Anglo-Manx). Common words and phrases in Anglo-Manx originating in the language include &quot;tholtan&quot; &quot;ruined farmhouse&quot;, &quot;quaaltagh&quot; &quot;first-foot&quot;, &quot;keeill&quot; &quot;(old) church&quot;, &quot;cammag&quot;, &quot;traa-dy-liooar&quot; &quot;time enough&quot;, and Tynwald (&quot;tinvaal&quot;), which is ultimately of Norse origin, but comes from Manx. It is suggested that the House of Keys takes its name from &quot;Kiare as Feed&quot; (four and twenty), which is the number of its sitting members.

==== Gaelic versions of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer ====
The Lord&#x27;s Prayer has been translated into all of the Gaelic languages (and Old Irish). Although not direct, it is a good demonstration of the differences between their orthographies.

== Media ==

Two weekly programmes in Manx are available on medium wave on Manx Radio: on Monday and on Friday. The news in Manx is available online from Manx Radio, who have three other weekly programmes that use the language: ; and . Several news readers on Manx Radio also use a good deal of incidental Manx.

The &quot;Isle of Man Examiner&quot; has a monthly bilingual column in Manx.

The first film to be made in Manx, 22-minute-long &quot;The Sheep Under the Snow&quot;, premiered in 1983 and was entered for the 5th Celtic Film and Television Festival in Cardiff in 1984. It was directed by Shorys Y Creayrie (George Broderick) for Foillan Films of Laxey, and is about the background to an early 18th-century folk song. In 2013, a short film, Solace in Wicca, was produced with financial assistance from Culture Vannin, CinemaNX and Isle of Man Film. A series of short cartoons about the life of Cú Chulainn which was produced by BBC Northern Ireland is available as are a series of cartoons on Manx mythology. Most significant is a 13-part DVD series Manx translation of the award-winning series &quot;Friends and Heroes&quot;.

=== Literature ===

Manx never had a large number of speakers, so it would not have been practical to mass-produce written literature. However, a body of oral literature did exist. The &quot;Fianna&quot; tales and others like them are known, including the Manx ballad , commemorating Finn MacCumhail and Oisín. With the coming of Protestantism, Manx spoken tales slowly disappeared, while a tradition of carvals, Christian ballads, developed with religious sanction. Even so, Bishop Mark Hildesley, after his gardener overheard him discussing the &quot;Ossian&quot; poems of James Macpherson and admitted to known of Fionn and Oisin, the Bishop collected from the local oral tradition multiple lays in Manx from the Fenian Cycle of Celtic Mythology, which were accordingly preserved for the future.

There is no record of literature written distinctively in Manx before the Reformation. By that time, any presumed literary link with Ireland and Scotland, such as through Irish-trained priests, had been lost. The first published literature in Manx was &quot;The Principles and Duties of Christianity ()&quot;, translated by Bishop of Sodor and Man Thomas Wilson.

The &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; was translated by John Phillips, the Welsh-born Anglican Bishop of Sodor and Man from 1605 to 1633. The early Manx script has some similarities with orthographical systems found occasionally in Scotland and in Ireland for the transliteration of Gaelic, such as the Book of the Dean of Lismore, as well as some extensive texts based on English and Scottish English orthographical practices of the time. Little secular Manx literature has been preserved.

The New Testament was first published in 1767. When the Anglican church authorities started to produce written literature in the Manx language in the 18th century, the system developed by John Philips was further &quot;anglicised&quot;; the one feature retained from Welsh orthography was the use of to represent (e.g. &quot;horse&quot; and &quot;help&quot; as well as (e.g. &quot;knowledge&quot;), though it is also used to represent , (e.g. &quot;John&quot; (vocative), &quot;fish&quot;).

Other works produced in the 18th and 19th centuries include catechisms, hymn books and religious tracts. A translation of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; was made by Rev. Thomas Christian of Marown in 1796.

A considerable amount of secular literature has been produced in the 20th and 21st centuries as part of the language revival. In 2006, the first full-length novel in Manx, (&quot;The Vampire Murders&quot;) was published by Brian Stowell, after being serialised in the press. There is an increasing amount of literature available in the language, and recent publications include Manx versions of the &quot;Gruffalo&quot; and &quot;Gruffalo&#x27;s Child&quot;.

Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s &quot;The Little Prince&quot; was translated into Manx by Rob Teare in 2019.

== Manx and Christianity ==
=== The Manx Bible ===

The Bible was first produced in Manx by a group of Anglican clergymen on the island. The Gospel of Matthew was printed in 1748. The Gospel and were produced in 1763 and 1767, respectively, by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK). In 1772 the Old Testament was printed, together with the Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) from the Apocrypha.

 &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; of the Old and New Testaments was published as one book by the SPCK in 1775, effectively fixing the modern orthography of Manx, which has changed little since. Jenner claims that some bowdlerisation had occurred in the translation, e.g. the occupation of Rahab the prostitute is rendered as &quot;a hostess, female inn-keeper.&quot; The bicentenary was celebrated in 1975 and included a set of stamps from the Isle of Man Post Office.

There was a translation of the (&quot;Psalms of David&quot;) in metre in Manx by the Rev John Clague, vicar of Rushen, which was printed with the Book of Common Prayer of 1768. Bishop Hildesley required that these Metrical Psalms were to be sung in churches. These were reprinted by in 1905.

The British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) published the &quot;New Testament&quot; in 1810 and reprinted it in 1824. &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; of the Old Testament and New Testament (without the two books of the Apocrypha) was first printed as a whole in 1819. BFBS last printed anything on paper in Manx in 1936 when it reprinted &quot;the Gospel of St John&quot;; this was reprinted by in 1968. The Manx Bible was republished by Shearwater Press in July 1979 as (Manx Family Bible), which was a reproduction of the BFBS 1819 Bible.

Since 2014 the BFBS 1936 Manx Gospel of John has been available online on YouVersion and Bibles.org.

=== Church ===
Manx has not been used in Mass since the late 19th century, though holds an annual Christmas service on the island.
In a move towards the Catholic Church in the Isle of Man having a Bishop of its own, in September 2023 St. Mary of the Isle Church in Douglas was granted Co-Cathedral status by Pope Francis. During the Mass of dedication by Malcolm McMahon, the Archbishop of Liverpool, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer was recited in Manx and the Manx National Anthem was also performed.

<doc id="20144" wikidata="Q209851" url="?curid=20144" title="Marcomanni">
<text>The Marcomanni were a Germanic people who lived close to the border of the Roman Empire, north of the River Danube, and are mentioned in Roman records from approximately 60 BC until about 400 AD. They were one of the most important members of the powerful cluster of allied Suebian peoples in this region, which also included the Hermunduri, Varisti, and Quadi along the Danube, and the Semnones and Langobardi to their north. 

After a major defeat to the Romans in about 9 BC, the Marcomanni somehow received a new king named Maroboduus, who had grown up in Rome. He subsequently led his people and several others into a region surrounded by forests and mountains in the present day Czech Republic. Before 9 BC the homeland of the Marcomanni is not known, but archaeological evidence suggests that they lived near the central Elbe river and Saale, or possibly to the southwest of this region in Franconia. The Marcomanni were first reported by Julius Caesar among the Germanic peoples who were attempting to settle in Gaul in 58 BC under the leadership of Ariovistus, but he did not explain where their homeland was. 

From his base in Bohemia, Maroboduus built up a Rome-aligned Suebian empire, but the Langobardi and Semnones left when Maroboduus failed to support the rebellion of Arminius against Rome. The subsequent war among the Germanic peoples was damaging to both sides. This damaged Maroboduus&#x27;s reputation, and he was eventually toppled from power, and died in exile in Ravenna. This suited the empire because despite their neutrality towards Rome, Roman rulers saw the Marcomanni as a potential threat to them, within striking distance of Italy. Over the centuries the Romans sought to control their leaders, and disrupt their relationships with neighbouring peoples. Despite long periods of peace and prosperity there were also several periods of intense warfare between them, often triggered by the actions of peoples living further from the Roman frontier. 

In the second century AD, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and his co-emperors, the Romans pursued a major series of bloody wars against the Marcomanni and their allies which are called the Marcomannic wars. At one point the Marcomanni and their allies invaded Italy itself. Eventually defeated, the Marcomanni were weakened, and many were moved into the Roman empire, but the tensions behind this war were never resolved, and their neighbours such as the Quadi continued to come into conflict with Rome. This ended only when Goths, Alans and Huns moved from the east into the Middle Danube region and took effective control of it in the late 4th century. The region subsequently came under the rule of Attila, who died in 453. By this time many Marcomanni apparently already lived within Pannonia in the Roman empire, and at least some of these had converted to Christianity. There are indications that a significant number apparently came to live to the south between the Sava and Drava rivers in what is now Slovenia and Croatia. More generally, although the details are now unclear, many Marcomanni and other Suebian communities from the region of the Elbe and Danube are believed to have joined the Langobardi who moved southwards into the Middle Danube region, replacing the short-lived kingdoms which arose after Attila&#x27;s death, and subsequently moved into Italy under pressure from the arrival of the Avars from the east. Other Marcomanni are likely to have joined the Alemanni, and Bavarians to their west, or even to have left the region entirely with the Suebi who founded the Kingdom of the Suebi in what is now Portugal and Spain.

==Name==
It is believed that the name of the Marcomanni comes from a Germanic language. The first part derives from a Proto-Germanic word reconstructed as &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;border, boundary&quot;, which is also the origin of the English words &quot;march&quot; and &quot;mark&quot;, meaning &quot;frontier&quot;, or &quot;border&quot;, as for example in the term &quot;Welsh marches&quot;. They were therefore &quot;border men&quot;. The Marcomanni already had this name before they encountered the Romans in Gaul in 58 BC, where both the Romans and the Marcomanni were foreigners. Their homeland up until that time, and therefore the frontier or march they originally lived near, is unknown.

==The time of Caesar and Ariovistus (58 BC)==
The Marcomanni first appear in historical records among the confederates of Ariovistus who fought against Julius Caesar in Gaul. Ariovistus led a large group of &quot;Germani&quot; settlers who had crossed the Rhine from what is now Germany, into what is now France. Caesar&#x27;s report of his battles mentions the Marcomanni among them only once, in his account of his victory in 58 BC. Caesar wrote that he approached the Germanic camp and forced them to draw up their forces. They &quot;arranged them by tribe (&quot;generatim&quot;, by &quot;gens&quot;), at equal distances, the Harudes, Marcomanni, Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes, Sedusii, Suebi; and surrounded their whole army with their chariots and wagons, that no hope might be left in flight. On these they placed their women, who, with outstretched hand and in tears, entreated the soldiers, as they went forward to battle, not to deliver them into slavery to the Romans.&quot; According to Caesar the Tribocci, Vangiones and Nemetes came from homelands nearby to the Rhine itself, but the others apparently came from further east.

The exact position of the Marcomanni homelands east of the Rhine at this time is not known. Although there is no scholarly consensus, one of the most common proposals is that they came from the region in northeastern Bavaria. It is generally accepted that they lived near to, or even among the Suebi, because later Roman writers connect the two peoples, and because of archaeological evidence showing Elbe Germanic peoples first entering present day central Germany and later entering the modern Bohemian area at the right time to match the Marcomanni. Caesar understood the country of the Suebi he faced to be in or near present day Hesse, Franconia, and Thuringia. Caesar himself made no mention of any special connection between the Suebi and Marcomanni, because he only mentioned the Marcomanni once in a list. It is nevertheless possible the Marcomanni were already seen as a branch of the Suebi, although this categorization is only made explicit in much later authors such as Strabo and Tacitus. Alternatively, between Caesar and Strabo there may have been changes in the relationship between the Suebi and Marcomanni, or in the terminology that was used. Caesar described the Suebi he encountered as the largest and the most warlike Germanic people (&quot;gens&quot;), who were divided into 100 districts (&quot;pagi&quot;) which supplied 1000 men each during war. The forces of these &quot;pagi&quot; were distinct within the Suevi forces, and it is sometimes suggested that the Marcomanni could have been one of these &quot;pagi&quot;. The Suebi were also able to call upon other countries (&quot;nationes&quot;) to supply infantry and cavalry reinforcements.

A later Roman historian, Cassius Dio, mentioned that part of a country where the Marcomanni had recently lived was settled by the Hermunduri in 7 BC with Roman permission, and this was apparently west of the Elbe, if we can assume that the events he described happened in one campaign. However this area is also not easy to identify. This is partly because the Hermunduri themselves were pushed east of the Elbe soon after, by the time of Strabo, who was writing around 20 AD. (Generations later, in the time of Tacitus around 100 AD, the Hermunduri were again friendly with Rome, and once again living west of the Elbe, stretching to the Danube in Raetia, apparently near present day Regensburg and Passau, to the &quot;sources&quot; of the Elbe, which may include the Vltava. However, it can&#x27;t be assumed that this is the same region they settled in 7 BC.) 

In terms of archaeological evidence the Marcomanni and their Suebian neighbours are strongly associated with the Grossromstedter archaeological culture of the Middle Elbe and Saale river regions. The area of this culture expanded southwest into the region between the Rhine and Werra before the Roman empire entered the region. And after the Roman conquests began it can be found expanding southeast into the Bohemian region. It was influenced not only by the older Jastorf culture of the central Elbe region, but notably also by the Przeworsk culture from further east in present day Poland. The variant which subsequently developed in the old Boii lands is called the Plaňany-Group, and shows the influence of their older Celtic La Tène culture associated with earlier Celtic peoples of these regions, such as the Boii and Volcae Tectosages. The present day Czech region had itself already come under Przeworsk influence in the generations before the Germanic influx. The name of the Marcomanni, which refers to a frontier, may echo an earlier demarcation somewhere between such Germanic and Celtic cultures.

The Marcomanni are archaeologically difficult to distinguish among the various Suebian groups such as the Quadi and Hermunduri who were bringing the Grossromstedter culture southwards and westwards. Furthermore, the Grossromstedter culture already began to have some influence in the Bohemian area after Caesar&#x27;s victories, and before the Marcomanni defeat in 9 BC.

==Near extermination by the Romans (9 BC)==
In the time of Augustus (reigned 27 BC – 14 AD), major invasions of Germania were launched, giving the Romans effective control of the part between the Rhine and Elbe rivers, until the rebellion of Arminius in 9 AD. During this period the Marcomanni suffered at least one major defeat and subsequently moved themselves into a more remote area surrounded by mountains and forests.

In the &quot;Res Gestae Divi Augusti&quot; which celebrates the reign of Augustus, it is boasted that among the many kings who took refuge with Augustus as suppliants, there was a king of the Marcomanni Suebi. The name of this king is no longer legible on the &quot;Monumentum Ancyranum&quot;, but it ended with &quot;-rus&quot;.

The Roman historians Florus, and Orosius reported that Drusus the elder almost wiped out the Marcomanni as part of a bloody and difficult campaign, and then erected a mound of Marcomanni spoils. This was during his campaigns of 12–9 BC, after he had defeated the Tencteri and Chatti, and before next turning to confront an alliance of the Cherusci, Suevi, and Sicambri. Another Roman source, Cassius Dio, describes the sequence of events somewhat differently, but does not mention the Marcomanni by name:
:Drusus, [...] invaded the country of the Chatti and advanced as far as that of the Suebi, conquering with difficulty the territory traversed and defeating the forces that attacked him only after considerable bloodshed. From there he proceeded to the country of the Cherusci, and crossing the Weser, advanced as far as the Elbe, pillaging everything on his way. [...] Drusus undertook to cross this river, but failing in the attempt, set up trophies and withdrew. 
There are doubts, therefore, about the exact sequence of events, and also about the locations of the battles. Scholars are not unanimous about whether the victory over the Marcomanni happened in 9 BC, which was the year of the victory over the Cherusci, Suebi and Sugambri, and also the year that Drusus died after reaching the Elbe. The location of the Marcomanni battle is often assumed to be in Franconia but an alternative hypothesis is that it was closer to the Cherusci, in the area of northeastern Hesse and western Thuringia. There are also scholars who propose that the Suebi defeated in the 9 BC campaign were in fact the same as the Marcomanni.

==The move to &quot;Bohemia&quot;==
A later Roman historian, Cassius Dio, implies that the Romans settled the Hermunduri in a place where the Marcomanni had previously been living in 7 BC, suggesting that the Marcomanni had left a previous homeland shortly before that year. According to the accounts of Tacitus, Velleius Paterculus, and Strabo the Marcomanni eventually moved into a part of the large area that had been occupied by the Boii, a region called &quot;Baiohaemum&quot;, where their allies and fellow Suevi lived, the Quadi. Scholars interpret this placename as clear early evidence of a Germanic language being used. &quot;Haemum&quot; corresponds to English &quot;home&quot; and German &quot;&quot; (Proto-Germanic &quot;&quot;), while the change from &quot;boi&quot;- to &quot;bai&quot;- corresponds to normal evolutions in Germanic languages. This ancient term is the origin of the modern regional name Bohemia, although the boundaries of this region were likely quite different from medieval and modern versions. These classical authors place the new settlement area of the Marcomanni within the Hercynian Forest, in an area near present day Bohemia and probably within it. By 6 BC, their king, Maroboduus, had established a powerful kingdom there that Augustus came to perceive as a threat to the Roman Empire. The archaeological evidence of this period, including both a number of cremation and inhumation burials, hints at a stratified society which gave special importance to its warrior class.
*Strabo, writing about 23 AD, appears to have written the earliest surviving mention of the long-term neighbours of the Marcomanni, the Quadi. Strabo described a mountain range running north of the Danube, like a smaller version of the Alps which runs south of it. Within it is the Hercynian forest, and within this forest are tribes of Suebi &quot;similar to&quot; [or &quot;such as&quot;] &quot;the tribes of the &quot;Coldui&quot; [καθάπερ τὰ τῶν κολδούων], in whose territory lies &quot;Buiaimon&quot;, the royal seat of Maroboduus&quot;. King Maroboduus, he wrote, led several peoples into this forested region, including his own people the Marcomanni. Having lived in Rome and been favoured by Augustus he became ruler of Suevi peoples in this forested region, and also over other Suevi living outside it bordering on the Dacians (who he calls Getae). Not only is Strabo&#x27;s spelling of Quadi with an &quot;L&quot; unexpected when compared to later references, but some scholars also doubt that the Maroboduus lived within Quadi territory. Errors are suspected in the surviving text. He goes on to specify that the Hercynian forest is on the north side of the Suebi, and the Gabreta Forest is on the southern or Roman side.
*A contemporary of Strabo, Velleius Paterculus, also described &quot;Boiohaemum&quot;, where Maroboduus and the Marcomanni lived. He said these &quot;plains surrounded by the Hercynian forest&quot; were the only part of Germania which the Romans did not control in the period before the Roman defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. Velleius also remarked that Maroboduus subjugated all his neighbours either by war or treaty. Hofeneder notes that many modern scholars interpret this to mean that the Quadi were also under his overlordship. Although there is no consensus about this, it is in any case clear that the two peoples were always closely connected during the many centuries in which they appear in records. Velleius said that Maroboduus drilled his Bohemian soldiers to almost Roman standards, and that although his policy was to avoid conflict with Rome, the Romans came to be concerned that he could invade Italy. &quot;Races and individuals who revolted from us [the Romans] found in him a refuge.&quot; From a Roman point of view he noted that the closest point of access to Bohemia was via Carnuntum. This was between present-day Vienna and Bratislava, and near the Quadi territory where the Morava river enters the Danube.
*Approximately 100 AD, Tacitus reflected upon the Marcomanni in his time and in the past, saying they &quot;stand first in strength and renown, and their very territory, from which the Boii were driven in a former age, was won by valour&quot;, suggesting (in contrast to other sources) that they had to defeat the remaining residents of the area. He also mentioned that both the Marcomanni and their neighbours the Quadi have &quot;kings of their own nation, descended from the noble stock of Maroboduus and Tudrus&quot;. However, he noted that they submit to foreigners, and their strength and power depend on Roman influence. Rome supports them by arms, and &quot;more frequently by our money&quot;.

==The empire of Maroboduus==
Maroboduus built up a Rome-aligned Suebian empire. According to Strabo it included the Lugii, Semnones, and Hermunduri, and he also mentioned otherwise unknown peoples: Zumi, Butones (perhaps the Gutones), Mugilones and Sibini. Velleius and Tacitus made it clear that by 5 AD it also included the Langobardi. According to Velleius he could call upon 70,000 experienced infantry and 4,000 cavalry, although these were probably not only Marcomanni. 

In 6 AD Augustus aimed to eliminate the last power center in Germania and sent two Roman army groups under Sentius Saturninus and Tiberius to attack the Marcomanni in a pincer movement starting from Roman camps or bases which were in or near in present day Marktbreit to the west and Carnuntum on the Danube. This did not go ahead because a major revolt started in Pannonia, south of the Danube, which had also only recently been conquered. Maroboduus remained neutral.

In 9 AD, Arminius of the Cherusci began his major revolt against the Romans. He sent the head of the defeated Roman general Publius Quinctilius Varus to Maroboduus, but Maroboduus sent it to Rome. The Langobardi and Semnones, Suebians living near to the Cherusci on the Elbe, defected from this kingdom in the name of freedom, both because Maroboduus did not support the revolt, and because he held royal power.

In 17 AD war broke out among these two alliances of Germanic peoples, led by Arminius and Maroboduus. Maroboduus requested help from Rome but the Romans reject him. According to Tacitus the Romans claimed that Maroboduus &quot;had no right to invoke the aid of Roman arms against the Cherusci, when he had rendered no assistance to the Romans in their conflict with the same enemy&quot;. After an indecisive battle, Maroboduus withdrew into the hilly forests of Bohemia in 18 AD. According to Tacitus, the Romans reacted by deliberately sowing discord among the Germani, &quot;urging them to complete the destruction of the now broken power of Maroboduus&quot;. This was all in line with the new foreign policy of the emperor Tiberius.

Already in 19 AD, Maroboduus was deposed and exiled by Catualda, who was a prince who had been living in exile among the Gutones on the Baltic coast, in what is now northern Poland. Maroboduus went into exile among the Romans and lived another 18 years in Ravenna.

==The Vannius regime==
Catualda&#x27;s victory was short-lived. He was in turn deposed by Vibilius of the Hermunduri that same year he came to power, 19 AD. The subjects of Maroboduus and Catualda, presumably mainly Marcomanni, were moved by the Romans to an area near the Danube, between the Morava and &quot;Cusus&quot; rivers, and placed under the control of the Quadian king Vannius. There are proposals that the Romans were deliberately trying to create a buffer state with this settlement, but there is no consensus about this. The area where Vannius ruled over the Marcomanni exiles is generally considered to have been a state distinct from the old Quadi kingdom itself. Unfortunately the Cusus river has not been identified with certainty. However, Slovak archaeological research locates a core area of the Vannius kingdom was probably in the fertile southwestern Slovakian lowlands around Trnava, east of the Little Carpathians. On the other hand, at the same time there were similar increases in activity west of the Little Carpathians near the Morava.

Vannius personally benefitted from the new situation and became very wealthy and unpopular. He was himself eventually also deposed by Vibilius and the Hermunduri, working together with the Lugii from the north, in 50/51 AD. Vannius&#x27;s soldiers during this conflict are described here as infantry, but he also called for cavalry from his Sarmatian allies and neighbours, the Iazyges, who lived in what is now Hungary. This revolt by Vibilius was coordinated with the nephews of Vannius, Vangio and Sido, who then divided his realm between themselves as loyal Roman client kings. Vannius was defeated and fled with his followers across the Danube, where they were assigned land in Roman Pannonia. This settlement is associated with Germanic finds from the 1st century AD in Burgenland, west of Lake Neusiedl. 

The Marcomanni are not specifically mentioned much in subsequent generations, possibly because they were now politically part of the Vannian regime which was centred around the Quadian powerbases closer to the Danube. Archaeological and other evidence indicates that the Marcomanni population also more generally moved, or at least became more active, to the southeast near the Morava river, while the Quadi and the Vannian kingdom expanded further east in the direction of what is now Hungary. Archaeological evidence shows further increase in the Germanic population just north of the Danube after the fall of Vannius, in present day Lower Austria, Moravia and western Slovakia. At the same time this region also received increasing amounts of imports from within the empire. The organization of the Marcomanni and Quadi states into different kingdoms is not made clear by surviving evidence, but it is believed that by this time the Marcomanni kingdom now came to stretch into this Danubian area, probably including areas in Moravia and Lower Austria, west of the Little Carpathians.

In 69 AD, the &quot;Year of the Four Emperors&quot;, two kings Sido and Italicus, the latter perhaps the son of Vangio, fought on the side of Vespasian in a Roman civil war. Tacitus described them as kings of the Suebians, and emphasized their loyalty to Rome. They were present at the second battle of Bedriacum in 69 AD at Cremona.

The Quadi and Marcomanni had a long and relatively stable relationship with the Romans but this was interrupted under emperor Domitian during the years 89-97 AD, after the Quadi and Marcomanni refused to assist in a conflict against the Dacians. In 89 AD, according to Dio Cassius, Domitian entered Pannonia to make war, killed the peace envoys sent to him, and was then defeated by the Marcomanni. This campaign was referred to as the war against the Suebi, or the Suebi and Sarmatians, or the Marcomanni, Quadi and Sarmatians. The relationship then stabilized again in the time of emperor Nerva (reigned 96-98).

==Marcomannic Wars==


The relationship between the Romans and the Quadi and their neighbours was far more seriously and permanently disrupted during the long series of conflicts called the Marcomannic or Germanic wars, which were fought mainly during the rule of emperor Marcus Aurelius (reigned 161-180 AD). 

In the 150s or 160s AD, 6000 Langobardi (Lombards originally from present-day north Germany) and Obii (whose identity is uncertain) crossed the Lower Danube into Roman territory where they were quickly defeated. Dio Cassius reports that these events worried several of the barbarian nations. A group of them selected Ballomarius, king of the Marcomanni, and ten other representatives of the other nations, in a peace mission to the governor of Roman Pannonia. Oaths were sworn and the envoys returned home. Some scholars think the Quadi may have been involved in this raid, or at least allowed it to happen. However the Quadi and their neighbours were facing their own problems with raiders from further north, and had been trying for some time to get more support from the empire. On their side, the Romans were apparently planning for a Germania campaign, and knew that Italy itself was threatened by these pressures, but were deliberately diplomatic while they were occupied with the Parthian campaign in the Middle East, and badly affected by the Antonine plague. However, the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; especially blames the Marcomanni and Victohali for throwing everything into confusion while other tribes had been driven on by the more distant barbarians.

Although a Roman offensive could not start in 167 AD, two new legions were raised and in 168 AD the two emperors, Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius, set out to cross the alps. Either in 167 AD, &quot;before&quot; the Romans setting, or in 169 AD, &quot;after&quot; the Romans came to a stop when Verus died, the Marcomanni and Quadi led a crossing of the Danube, and an attack into Italy itself. They destroyed Opitergium (present-day Oderzo) and put the important town of Aquileia under siege. Whatever the exact sequence of events, the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; says that with the Romans in action several kings of the barbarians retreated, and some of the barbarians put anti-Roman leaders to death. In particular, the Quadi, having lost their king, announced they would not confirm an elected successor without approval from the emperors.

Marcus Aurelius returned to Rome but headed north again in the autumn of 169. He established a Danubian headquarters in Carnuntum between present-day Vienna and Bratislava. From here he could receive embassies from the different peoples north of the Danube. Some were given the possibility to settle in the empire, others were recruited to fight on the Roman side. The Quadi were pacified, and in 171 AD they agreed to leave their coalition, and returned deserters, and 13,000 prisoners of war. They supplied horses and cattle as war contributions, and promised not to allow Marcomanni or Iazyges passage through their territory. By 173 AD the Quadi had rebelled again, and they expelled their Roman-approved king Furtius, replacing with Ariogaisos. In a major battle between 172 and 174 AD, a Roman force was almost defeated, until a sudden rainstorm allowed them to defeat the Quadi. The incident is well-known because of the account given by Dio Cassius, and on the Column of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. By 175 AD the cavalry from the Marcomanni, Naristae, and Quadi were forced to travel to the Middle East, and in 176 AD Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus held a triumph as victors over Germania and Sarmatia.

The situation remained disturbed in subsequent years. The Romans declared a new war in 177 AD and set off in 178 AD, naming the Marcomanni, Hermunduri, Sarmatians, and Quadi as specific enemies. Rome executed a successful and decisive battle against them in 179 AD at Laugaricio (present-day Trenčín in Slovakia) under the command of legate and procurator Marcus Valerius Maximianus. By 180 AD the Quadi and Marcomanni were in a state of occupation, with Roman garrisons of 20,000 men each permanently stationed in both countries. The Romans even blocked the mountain passes so that they could not migrate north to live with the Semnones. Marcus Aurelius was considering the creation of a new imperial province called Marcomannia when he died in 180.

Commodus the son of Marcus Aurelius made peace soon after the death of his father in 180 AD, but he did not go ahead with plans to create a new Roman province. Some Marcomanni were subsequently settled in Italy and other parts of the empire, while others were forced to serve in the military.

==Third century==

Around 214/215 AD, Dio Cassius reports that because of raids into Pannonia, the emperor Caracalla invited the Quadi king Gaiobomarus to meet him, and then had him executed. According to this report Caracalla &quot;claimed that he had overcome the recklessness, greed, and treachery of the Germans by deceit, since these qualities could not be conquered by force&quot;, and he was proud of the &quot;enmity with the Vandili and the Marcomani, who had been friends, and in having executed Gaïobomarus&quot;.

The centre of activity of the Suebians along the Danube shifted east during the third century, towards what is now the Slovakia-Hungary border. This apparently reflects the increased importance of the Quadi, and the decreased importance of the Marcomanni.

During the reign of the Roman emperor Philip the Arab (reigned 244-249 AD), who cut off gifts which were being paid to Ukrainian Goths under the rule of Ostrogotha, the 6th century writer Jordanes believed that the Marcomanni were also paying tribute to this same Gothic king, and the princes of the Quadi were effectively slaves of the Goths.

During the reign of Valerian (253-260 AD) the historian Zosimus reported that the Marcomanni made excursions at the same time as &quot;Scythians&quot; (Goths and allied peoples from Ukraine), making inroads into all the countries adjacent to the empire, laying Thessalonica waste. Valerian&#x27;s son Gallienus (reigned 253-268 AD) settled the Marcomanni within the Roman province of Pannonia Superior, south of the Danube. He also took Pipa or Pipara, the daughter of the Marcomanni king, Attalus, as a concubine.

Although the details are not clear, the emperor Diocletian claimed a triumph over the Marcomanni in 299 AD.

==Fourth century and later==

Although the Quadi and other allies continued to be mentioned by historians in the fourth century, the records say little about the Marcomanni until after the death of Valentinian I during a period of conflict with the Quadi in 375 AD, and after the great Roman defeat to the Goths, Alans and Huns at the Battle of Adrianople in 378 AD. It seems that the Rugii and Heruli may have already moved into the Marcomanni&#x27;s traditional region during this period. The &quot;Laterculus Veronensis&quot; shows that Heruli and Rugii were already present somewhere in western Europe in about 314. Similar listings from later in the 4th century, the &quot;Cosmographia&quot; of Julius Honorius, and probably also the &quot;Liber Generationis&quot;, both listed the Heruli together with the Marcomanni and Quadi, in whose traditional region the Herule kingdom would later be found.

The defeat at Adrianople had a major impact upon the Pannonian/Danubian region. Although there is no consensus about the details, the Romans now quickly tried new approaches to settling newcomers in large numbers. One of the armed groups responsible for the defeat, led by Alatheus and Saphrax, were settled into the Pannonian part of the Roman empire, near the Marcomanni homeland, and expected to do military service for Rome. In effect however, Rome seems to have lost effective control of the region. The Goths, Alans and Huns suddenly came to dominate several such regions, supposedly still within the empire, and also became massively important within the Roman military.

After the death of emperor Theodosius I in 395, Saint Jerome listed the Marcomanni, Quadi, Vandals and Sarmatians, together with several of the new eastern peoples causing devastation in the Roman provinces stretching from Constantinople to the Julian Alps, including Dalmatia, and all the provinces of Pannonia: &quot;Goths and Sarmatians, Quadi and Alans, Huns and Vandals and Marcomanni&quot;. Claudian describes them crossing the frozen Danube with wagons, and then setting wagons around themselves like a wall at the approach of the Roman commander Stilicho. He says that all the fertile lands between the Black Sea and Adriatic were subsequently like uninhabited deserts, specifically including Dalmatia and Pannonia. At the same time, the Gothic general Alaric I, who had loyally served with his Gothic troops under Theodosius I at the Battle of Frigidus only a few months early, was beginning his famous rebellion, and started leading his army south, first towards Constantinople, and later towards Greece. This was triggered by internal Roman conflicts after the death of Theodosius. Claudian claimed that they were all incited by an Eastern Roman consul and enemy of Stilicho, Rufinus. The exact connection between Alaric and the groups who crossed the Danube at the same time remains unclear.

Soon after this, Ambrose, bishop of Milan 374-397, corresponded with a Christian Marcomanni queen named Fritigil, initiating a peace treaty between the Marcomanni and the western Roman military leader Stilicho. That was the last clear evidence of the Marcomanni having a polity, which was probably now on the Roman side of the Danube, in Pannonia. Soon afterward, the Pannonian and Danubian area went into a long period of turmoil, under the influence of peoples from the east including the Huns, Goths and Alans. Nevertheless, there are records indicating that Marcomanni continued to exist within Roman territory, where it seems that they were given initially responsibility for defence of parts of the Upper Danube. The &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; which describes the Roman military of around 420 AD also lists palatine auxiliaries (court troops) of the &quot;Marcomanni Honoriani seniores&quot; and &quot;iuniores&quot; for Italy, as well as the &quot;Equites Marcomanni&quot; for the mobile army in North Africa. 

Some of the Marcomanni may have been among the Suebi who invaded Iberia in about 409, and established the kingdom in the Roman province of Gallaecia. These Suevi were probably a mix of Suevian groups from the area north of Danube and Pannonian basin such as the Marcomanni, Quadi and Buri.

In the Danubian area, Attila came to be acknowledged as ruler. There is no direct &quot;contemporary&quot; evidence that any Marcomanni or Quadi continued to exist as his subjects or allies under their old names. However, centuries later Paulus Diaconus listed the subject peoples who Attila could call upon, in addition to the better-known Goths and Gepids, and mentioned &quot;Marcomanni, Suebi, Quadi&quot;, alongside the expected &quot;Herules, Thuringi and Rugii&quot;. This implies that the Marcomanni might for example have been present at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451. However, modern scholars have doubts about whether the Marcomanni or Quadi would still have been identified under those names under Attila in 451, because contemporary sources don&#x27;t mention them.

While it is not clear what happened to the Marcomanni and other Suebi during Attila&#x27;s time, after he died in 453 a Suebian kingdom appeared which was ruled by a man named Hunimund and existed in or near north-eastern Pannonia. This may have been made up of Quadi, or a mixture of Suebians. After being defeated by the Ostrogoths, Hunimund and some of his people seem to have moved west and joined the Alemanni. The record which mentions the Suebi joining the Alemanni is also one of the first records mentioning the early Bavarians, or Baiuvarii, who were also living south of the Danube, to the east of the Alemanni, in what had been Roman territory. It is generally believed that their name is Germanic, and that it indicates an origin in the nearby regions to the east, including Roman Pannonia, which were once inhabited by the Boii. It is therefore considered very likely that the Baiuvarii included Marcomanni.

Possibly distinct from the Suebi led by Hunimund, the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot;, a much later document which used sources which are in many cases now lost, indicates that a Marcannori people (&quot;Marcannorum gens&quot;) lived in the mountainous southwest of Pannonia near the Sava river. A Sava or Suavia province between the Sava and Drava rivers, continued to exist during the time when the Ostrogoths ruled Italy, and may have been named after these Suebi (Suavi). It is possible that the Suebi moved into this more southern area after the defeat of Hunimund, or they may have been a separate group. During the Ostrogothic period, these Suebi were legally distinguished from the native populations under the term &quot;old barbarians&quot; (&quot;antiqui barbari&quot;), which also distinguished them legally from the new non-Romans, the Goths. Unusually, they were legally permitted to marry the provincial residents, and could therefore become part of the land owning class. Some scholars believe these were descendants of the Christian Marcomanni of Queen Fritigil. During the time of Theoderic the Great a group of Alemanni crossed the alps with cattle and wagons to seek refuge with these &quot;antiqui barbari&quot;. Procopius noted that in 537, the Ostrogoths recruited an army of these Suebi to launch an attack against areas held by the Eastern Roman empire. In 540 Ostrogothic rule in the Sava region came to an end, and the Suebi came under the authority of Eastern Roman emperor Justinian.

In the 530s the Langobardi (Lombards), who had been moving southwards in steps over several generations, entered the Sava area, and in the 540s the Eastern empire ceded control of it to them. The Suebi of the Sava region were among the peoples who were allowed to assimilate into Lombard society, if they accepted to live as Lombards under Lombard law. The Lombards, facing pressure from the arrival of the Avars into the area, moved into Italy and began taking control of it, bit by bit.

<text>Maroboduus (d. AD 37), also known as Marbod, was a king of the Marcomanni, who were a Germanic Suebian people. He spent part of his youth in Rome, and returning, found his people under pressure from invasions by the Roman Empire between the Rhine and Elbe. He led them into the forests of Bohemia, near to the Quadi who already lived nearby, and established a large alliance.

==Name==
The name appears in Latin and Greek texts spelt variously: &quot;Maroboduus, Marobodus, Maraboduus, Meroboduus, Morobuduus, Moroboduus, Marbodus&quot; and &quot;Marabodus&quot; in Latin sources; &quot;Maroboudos&quot; and &quot;Baroboudos&quot; in Greek ones.

According to linguist Xavier Delamarre, the personal name &quot;Maroboduus&quot; is a latinized form of Gaulish &quot;Maro-boduos&quot;, from &quot;maro&quot;- (&#x27;great&#x27;) attached to &quot;boduos&quot; (&#x27;crow&#x27;; cf. Middle Irish &quot;bodb&quot; &#x27;scald-crow, war-divinity&#x27;, Old Breton &quot;bodou&quot; &#x27;ardea&#x27;; also Common Brittonic &quot;Boduoci&quot;). The Celtic personal names &quot;Boduus&quot;, &quot;Teuto-boduus&quot;, &quot;Ate-boduus&quot;, &quot;Soli-boduus&quot;, &quot;Boduo-genus&quot;, and &quot;Buduo-gnatus&quot; are related. Philologist John T. Koch argues that Middle Irish &quot;bodb&quot; must be understood as the &#x27;bird on the battlefield and manifestation of the war-goddess&#x27;.

The second element of the name, &quot;boduos&quot;, is a term shared by Celtic and Germanic languages, where it is found as the common noun *&quot;badwō&quot; (&#x27;battle&#x27;; cf. ON &quot;bǫð&quot;, OE &quot;beado&quot;, OS &quot;badu&quot;-&quot;,&quot; OHG &quot;batu-&quot;) and in the name of the war goddess &quot;Baduhenna&quot;. The original meaning of Celtic–Germanic *&quot;bhodhwo&quot;- must have been &#x27;battle, fight&#x27;, later metaphorised in Celtic as &#x27;crow&#x27;, a bird symbolizing the carnage in battle.

==Biography==
Maroboduus was born into a noble family of the Marcomanni. As a young man, he lived in Italy and enjoyed the favour of the Emperor Augustus. The Marcomanni had been beaten utterly by the Romans in 10 BC. About 9 BC, Maroboduus returned to Germania and became ruler of his people. To deal with the threat of Roman expansion into the Rhine-Danube basin, he led the Marcomanni to the area later known as Bohemia to be outside the range of the Roman influence. There, he took the title of king and organized a confederation of several neighboring Germanic tribes. He was the first documented ruler of Bohemia with a government.
Augustus planned in 6 AD to destroy the kingdom of Maroboduus, which he considered to be too dangerous for the Romans. The future emperor Tiberius commanded 12 legions to attack the Marcomanni, but the outbreak of a revolt in Illyria, and the need for troops there, forced Tiberius to conclude a treaty with Maroboduus and to recognize him as king.

==War with Arminius and death==
His rivalry with Arminius, the Cheruscan leader who inflicted the devastating defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest on the Romans under Publius Quinctilius Varus in 9 AD, prevented a concerted attack on Roman territory across the Rhine in the north (by Arminius) and in the Danube basin in the south (by Maroboduus).

However, according to the first-century AD historian Marcus Velleius Paterculus, Arminius sent Varus&#x27;s head to Maroboduus, but the king of the Marcomanni sent it to Augustus. In the revenge war of Tiberius and Germanicus against the Cherusci, in 16 AD, Maroboduus stayed neutral.

In 17 AD, war broke out between Arminius and Maroboduus, and after an indecisive battle, Maroboduus withdrew into the hilly forests of Bohemia in 18 AD. In the next year, Catualda, a young Marcomannic nobleman living in exile among the Gutones, returned, perhaps by a subversive Roman intervention, and defeated Maroboduus. The deposed king had to flee to Italy, and Tiberius detained him for 18 years in Ravenna. There, Maroboduus died in 37 AD. Catualda was, in turn, defeated by the Hermunduri Vibilius, after which the realm was ruled by the Quadian Vannius. Vannius was himself also deposed by Vibilius, in coordination with his nephews Vangio and Sido, who then ruled as Roman client kings.

<text>A muon ( ; from the Greek letter mu (μ) used to represent it) is an elementary particle similar to the electron, with an electric charge of −1 &quot;e&quot; and spin-1/2, but with a much greater mass. It is classified as a lepton. As with other leptons, the muon is not thought to be composed of any simpler particles.

The muon is an unstable subatomic particle with a mean lifetime of , much longer than many other subatomic particles. As with the decay of the free neutron (with a lifetime around 15 minutes), muon decay is slow (by subatomic standards) because the decay is mediated only by the weak interaction (rather than the more powerful strong interaction or electromagnetic interaction), and because the mass difference between the muon and the set of its decay products is small, providing few kinetic degrees of freedom for decay. Muon decay almost always produces at least three particles, which must include an electron of the same charge as the muon and two types of neutrinos.

Like all elementary particles, the muon has a corresponding antiparticle of opposite charge (+1 &quot;e&quot;) but equal mass and spin: the antimuon (also called a &quot;positive muon&quot;). Muons are denoted by and antimuons by . Formerly, muons were called &quot;mu mesons&quot;, but are not classified as mesons by modern particle physicists , and that name is no longer used by the physics community.

Muons have a mass of , which is approximately times that of the electron, &quot;m&quot;. There is also a third lepton, the tau, approximately 17 times heavier than the muon.

Due to their greater mass, muons accelerate more slowly than electrons in electromagnetic fields, and emit less bremsstrahlung (deceleration radiation). This allows muons of a given energy to penetrate far deeper into matter because the deceleration of electrons and muons is primarily due to energy loss by the bremsstrahlung mechanism. For example, so-called secondary muons, created by cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere, can penetrate the atmosphere and reach Earth&#x27;s land surface and even into deep mines.

Because muons have a greater mass and energy than the decay energy of radioactivity, they are not produced by radioactive decay. Nonetheless, they are produced in great amounts in high-energy interactions in normal matter, in certain particle accelerator experiments with hadrons, and in cosmic ray interactions with matter. These interactions usually produce pi mesons initially, which almost always decay to muons.

As with the other charged leptons, the muon has an associated muon neutrino, denoted by , which differs from the electron neutrino and participates in different nuclear reactions.

== History of Discovery ==
Muons were discovered by Carl D. Anderson and Seth Neddermeyer at Caltech in 1936 while studying cosmic radiation. Anderson noticed particles that curved differently from electrons and other known particles when passed through a magnetic field. They were negatively charged but curved less sharply than electrons, but more sharply than protons, for particles of the same velocity. It was assumed that the magnitude of their negative electric charge was equal to that of the electron, and so to account for the difference in curvature, it was supposed that their mass was greater than an electron&#x27;s but smaller than a proton&#x27;s. Thus Anderson initially called the new particle a &quot;mesotron&quot;, adopting the prefix &quot;meso-&quot; from the Greek word for &quot;mid-&quot;. The existence of the muon was confirmed in 1937 by J. C. Street and E. C. Stevenson&#x27;s cloud chamber experiment.

A particle with a mass in the meson range had been predicted before the discovery of any mesons, by theorist Hideki Yukawa:
It seems natural to modify the theory of Heisenberg and Fermi in the following way. The transition of a heavy particle from neutron state to proton state is not always accompanied by the emission of light particles. The transition is sometimes taken up by another heavy particle.
Because of its mass, the mu meson was initially thought to be Yukawa&#x27;s particle and some scientists, including Niels Bohr, originally named it the &quot;yukon&quot;. 
The fact that the mesotron (i.e. the muon) was not Yukawa&#x27;s particle was established in 1946 by an experiment conducted by Marcello Conversi, Oreste Piccioni, and Ettore Pancini in Rome. In this experiment, which Luis Walter Alvarez called the &quot;start of modern particle physics&quot; in his 1968 Nobel lecture, they showed that the muons from cosmic rays were decaying without being captured by atomic nuclei, contrary to what was expected of the mediator of the nuclear force postulated by Yukawa. Yukawa&#x27;s predicted particle, the pi meson, was finally identified in 1947 (again from cosmic ray interactions).

With two particles now known with the intermediate mass, the more general term &quot;meson&quot; was adopted to refer to any such particle within the correct mass range between electrons and nucleons. Further, in order to differentiate between the two different types of mesons after the second meson was discovered, the initial mesotron particle was renamed the &quot;mu meson&quot; (the Greek letter &quot;μ&quot; [&quot;mu&quot;] corresponds to &quot;m&quot;), and the new 1947 meson (Yukawa&#x27;s particle) was named the &quot;pi meson&quot;.

As more types of mesons were discovered in accelerator experiments later, it was eventually found that the mu meson significantly differed not only from the pi meson (of about the same mass), but also from all other types of mesons. The difference, in part, was that mu mesons did not interact with the nuclear force, as pi mesons did (and were required to do, in Yukawa&#x27;s theory). Newer mesons also showed evidence of behaving like the pi meson in nuclear interactions, but not like the mu meson. Also, the mu meson&#x27;s decay products included both a neutrino and an antineutrino, rather than just one or the other, as was observed in the decay of other charged mesons.

In the eventual Standard Model of particle physics codified in the 1970s, all mesons other than the mu meson were understood to be hadrons – that is, particles made of quarks – and thus subject to the nuclear force. In the quark model, a &quot;meson&quot; was no longer defined by mass (for some had been discovered that were very massive – more than nucleons), but instead were particles composed of exactly two quarks (a quark and antiquark), unlike the baryons, which are defined as particles composed of three quarks (protons and neutrons were the lightest baryons). Mu mesons, however, had shown themselves to be fundamental particles (leptons) like electrons, with no quark structure. Thus, mu &quot;mesons&quot; were not mesons at all, in the new sense and use of the term &quot;meson&quot; used with the quark model of particle structure.

With this change in definition, the term &quot;mu meson&quot; was abandoned, and replaced whenever possible with the modern term &quot;muon&quot;, making the term &quot;mu meson&quot; only a historical footnote. In the new quark model, other types of mesons sometimes continued to be referred to in shorter terminology (e.g., &quot;pion&quot; for pi meson), but in the case of the muon, it retained the shorter name and was never again properly referred to by older &quot;mu meson&quot; terminology.

The eventual recognition of the muon as a simple &quot;heavy electron&quot;, with no role at all in the nuclear interaction, seemed so incongruous and surprising at the time, that Nobel laureate I. I. Rabi famously quipped, &quot;Who ordered that?&quot;

In the Rossi–Hall experiment (1941), muons were used to observe the time dilation (or, alternatively, length contraction) predicted by special relativity, for the first time.

== Muon sources ==

Muons arriving on the Earth&#x27;s surface are created indirectly as decay products of collisions of cosmic rays with particles of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

When a cosmic ray proton impacts atomic nuclei in the upper atmosphere, pions are created. These decay within a relatively short distance (meters) into muons (their preferred decay product), and muon neutrinos. The muons from these high-energy cosmic rays generally continue in about the same direction as the original proton, at a velocity near the speed of light. Although their lifetime &quot;without&quot; relativistic effects would allow a half-survival distance of only about 456 meters at most (as seen from Earth), the time dilation effect of special relativity (from the viewpoint of the Earth) allows cosmic ray secondary muons to survive the flight to the Earth&#x27;s surface, since in the Earth frame the muons have a longer half-life due to their velocity. From the viewpoint (inertial frame) of the muon, on the other hand, it is the length contraction effect of special relativity that allows this penetration, since in the muon frame its lifetime is unaffected, but the length contraction causes distances through the atmosphere and Earth to be far shorter than these distances in the Earth rest-frame. Both effects are equally valid ways of explaining the fast muon&#x27;s unusual survival over distances.

Since muons are unusually penetrative of ordinary matter, like neutrinos, they are also detectable deep underground (700 meters at the Soudan 2 detector) and underwater, where they form a major part of the natural background ionizing radiation. Like cosmic rays, as noted, this secondary muon radiation is also directional.

The same nuclear reaction described above (i.e. hadron–hadron impacts to produce pion beams, which then quickly decay to muon beams over short distances) is used by particle physicists to produce muon beams, such as the beam used for the muon &quot;g&quot;−2 experiment.

==Muon decay==

Muons are unstable elementary particles and are heavier than electrons and neutrinos but lighter than all other matter particles. They decay via the weak interaction. Because leptonic family numbers are conserved in the absence of an extremely unlikely immediate neutrino oscillation, one of the product neutrinos of muon decay must be a muon-type neutrino and the other an electron-type antineutrino (antimuon decay produces the corresponding antiparticles, as detailed below).

Because charge must be conserved, one of the products of muon decay is always an electron of the same charge as the muon (a positron if it is a positive muon). Thus all muons decay to at least an electron, and two neutrinos. Sometimes, besides these necessary products, additional other particles that have no net charge and spin of zero (e.g., a pair of photons, or an electron-positron pair), are produced.

The dominant muon decay mode (sometimes called the Michel decay after Louis Michel) is the simplest possible: the muon decays to an electron, an electron antineutrino, and a muon neutrino. Antimuons, in mirror fashion, most often decay to the corresponding antiparticles: a positron, an electron neutrino, and a muon antineutrino. In formulaic terms, these two decays are:
: → + 

The mean lifetime, , of the (positive) muon is . The equality of the muon and antimuon lifetimes has been established to better than one part in 104.

=== Prohibited decays ===
Certain neutrino-less decay modes are kinematically allowed but are, for all practical purposes, forbidden in the Standard Model, even given that neutrinos have mass and oscillate. Examples forbidden by lepton flavour conservation are:
and

Taking into account neutrino mass, a decay like → + is technically possible in the Standard Model (for example by neutrino oscillation of a virtual muon neutrino into an electron neutrino), but such a decay is extremely unlikely and therefore should be experimentally unobservable. Fewer than one in 1050 muon decays should produce such a decay.

Observation of such decay modes would constitute clear evidence for theories beyond the Standard Model. Upper limits for the branching fractions of such decay modes were measured in many experiments starting more than years ago. The current upper limit for the → + branching fraction was measured 2009–2013 in the MEG experiment and is .

=== Theoretical decay rate ===

The muon decay width that follows from Fermi&#x27;s golden rule has dimension of energy, and must be proportional to the square of the amplitude, and thus the square of Fermi&#x27;s coupling constant (formula_1), with over-all dimension of inverse fourth power of energy. By dimensional analysis, this leads to Sargent&#x27;s rule of fifth-power dependence on ,
:formula_2
where formula_3, and:
:formula_4 is the fraction of the maximum energy transmitted to the electron.

The decay distributions of the electron in muon decays have been parameterised using the so-called Michel parameters. The values of these four parameters are predicted unambiguously in the Standard Model of particle physics, thus muon decays represent a good test of the spacetime structure of the weak interaction. No deviation from the Standard Model predictions has yet been found.

For the decay of the muon, the expected decay distribution for the Standard Model values of Michel parameters is
:formula_5
where formula_6 is the angle between the muon&#x27;s polarization vector formula_7 and the decay-electron momentum vector, and formula_8 is the fraction of muons that are forward-polarized. Integrating this expression over electron energy gives the angular distribution of the daughter electrons:
:formula_9
The electron energy distribution integrated over the polar angle (valid for formula_10) is
:formula_11

Because the direction the electron is emitted in (a polar vector) is preferentially aligned opposite the muon spin (an axial vector), the decay is an example of non-conservation of parity by the weak interaction. This is essentially the same experimental signature as used by the original demonstration. More generally in the Standard Model, all charged leptons decay via the weak interaction and likewise violate parity symmetry.

== Muonic atoms ==
The muon was the first elementary particle discovered that does not appear in ordinary atoms.

=== Negative muon atoms ===
&quot;Negative&quot; muons can form muonic atoms (previously called mu-mesic atoms), by replacing an electron in ordinary atoms. Muonic hydrogen atoms are much smaller than typical hydrogen atoms because the much larger mass of the muon gives it a much more localized ground-state wavefunction than is observed for the electron. In multi-electron atoms, when only one of the electrons is replaced by a muon, the size of the atom continues to be determined by the other electrons, and the atomic size is nearly unchanged. Nonetheless, in such cases, the orbital of the muon continues to be smaller and far closer to the nucleus than the atomic orbitals of the electrons.

Spectroscopic measurements in muonic hydrogen have been used to produce a precise estimate of the proton radius. The results of these measurements diverged from the then accepted value giving rise to the so called proton radius puzzle. Later this puzzle found its resolution when new improved measurements of the proton radius in the electronic hydrogen became available. 

Muonic helium is created by substituting a muon for one of the electrons in helium-4. The muon orbits much closer to the nucleus, so muonic helium can therefore be regarded like an isotope of helium whose nucleus consists of two neutrons, two protons and a muon, with a single electron outside. Chemically, muonic helium, possessing an unpaired valence electron, can bond with other atoms, and behaves more like a hydrogen atom than an inert helium atom.

Muonic heavy hydrogen atoms with a negative muon may undergo nuclear fusion in the process of muon-catalyzed fusion, after the muon may leave the new atom to induce fusion in another hydrogen molecule. This process continues until the negative muon is captured by a helium nucleus, where it remains until it decays.

Negative muons bound to conventional atoms can be captured (muon capture) through the weak force by protons in nuclei, in a sort of electron-capture-like process. When this happens, nuclear transmutation results: The proton becomes a neutron and a muon neutrino is emitted.

=== Positive muon atoms ===
A &quot;positive&quot; muon, when stopped in ordinary matter, cannot be captured by a proton since the two positive charges can only repel. The positive muon is also not attracted to the nucleus of atoms. Instead, it binds a random electron and with this electron forms an exotic atom known as muonium (mu) atom. In this atom, the muon acts as the nucleus. The positive muon, in this context, can be considered a pseudo-isotope of hydrogen with one ninth of the mass of the proton. Because the mass of the electron is much smaller than the mass of both the proton and the muon, the reduced mass of muonium, and hence its Bohr radius, is very close to that of hydrogen. Therefore this bound muon-electron pair can be treated to a first approximation as a short-lived &quot;atom&quot; that behaves chemically like the isotopes of hydrogen (protium, deuterium and tritium).

Both positive and negative muons can be part of a short-lived pi-mu atom consisting of a muon and an oppositely charged pion. These atoms were observed in the 1970s in experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory and Fermilab.

== Anomalous magnetic dipole moment ==
The anomalous magnetic dipole moment is the difference between the experimentally observed value of the magnetic dipole moment and the theoretical value predicted by the Dirac equation. The measurement and prediction of this value is very important in the precision tests of QED. The E821 experiment at Brookhaven and the Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab studied the precession of the muon spin in a constant external magnetic field as the muons circulated in a confining storage ring. The Muon g-2 collaboration reported in 2021:
: formula_12

The prediction for the value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment includes three parts:
: &quot;μ&quot;SM = &quot;μ&quot;QED + &quot;μ&quot;EW + &quot;μ&quot;had.

The difference between the &quot;g&quot;-factors of the muon and the electron is due to their difference in mass. Because of the muon&#x27;s larger mass, contributions to the theoretical calculation of its anomalous magnetic dipole moment from Standard Model weak interactions and from contributions involving hadrons are important at the current level of precision, whereas these effects are not important for the electron. The muon&#x27;s anomalous magnetic dipole moment is also sensitive to contributions from new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry. For this reason, the muon&#x27;s anomalous magnetic moment is normally used as a probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model rather than as a test of QED. Muon &quot;g&quot;−2, a new experiment at Fermilab using the E821 magnet improved the precision of this measurement.

In 2020 an international team of 170 physicists calculated the most accurate prediction for the theoretical value of the muon&#x27;s anomalous magnetic moment.

=== Muon g−2 ===
Muon g-2 is a particle physics experiment at Fermilab to measure the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of a muon to a precision of 0.14 ppm, which is a sensitive test of the Standard Model. It might also provide evidence of the existence of entirely new particles.

In 2021, the Muon g−2 Experiment presented their first results of a new experimental average that increased the difference between experiment and theory to 4.2 standard deviations.

== Electric dipole moment ==
The current experimental limit on the muon electric dipole moment, |&quot;d&quot;&quot;μ&quot;| &lt; 1.9 × 10−19 e·cm set by the E821 experiment at the Brookhaven, is orders of magnitude above the Standard Model prediction. The observation of a non-zero muon electric dipole moment would provide an additional source of CP violation. An improvement in sensitivity by two orders of magnitude over the Brookhaven limit is expected from the experiments at Fermilab.

== Muon radiography and tomography ==
Since muons are much more deeply penetrating than X-rays or gamma rays, muon imaging can be used with much thicker material or, with cosmic ray sources, larger objects. One example is commercial muon tomography used to image entire cargo containers to detect shielded nuclear material, as well as explosives or other contraband.

The technique of muon transmission radiography based on cosmic ray sources was first used in the 1950s to measure the depth of the overburden of a tunnel in Australia and in the 1960s to search for possible hidden chambers in the Pyramid of Chephren in Giza. In 2017, the discovery of a large void (with a length of 30 metres minimum) by observation of cosmic-ray muons was reported.

In 2003, the scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory developed a new imaging technique: &quot;muon scattering tomography&quot;. With muon scattering tomography, both incoming and outgoing trajectories for each particle are reconstructed, such as with sealed aluminum drift tubes. Since the development of this technique, several companies have started to use it.

In August 2014, Decision Sciences International Corporation announced it had been awarded a contract by Toshiba for use of its muon tracking detectors in reclaiming the Fukushima nuclear complex. The Fukushima Daiichi Tracker was proposed to make a few months of muon measurements to show the distribution of the reactor cores. In December 2014, Tepco reported that they would be using two different muon imaging techniques at Fukushima, &quot;muon scanning method&quot; on Unit 1 (the most badly damaged, where the fuel may have left the reactor vessel) and &quot;muon scattering method&quot; on Unit 2. The International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning IRID in Japan and the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization KEK call the method they developed for Unit 1 the &quot;muon permeation method&quot;; 1,200 optical fibers for wavelength conversion light up when muons come into contact with them. After a month of data collection, it is hoped to reveal the location and amount of fuel debris still inside the reactor. The measurements began in February 2015.

<text>Michael John Muuss (October 16, 1958 – November 20, 2000) was the American author of the freeware network tool ping, as well as the first interactive ray tracing program.
==Career==
A graduate of Johns Hopkins University, Muuss was a senior scientist specializing in geometric solid modeling, ray-tracing, MIMD architectures and digital computer networks at the United States Army Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland when he died. He wrote a number of software packages (including BRL-CAD) and network tools (including ttcp and the concept of the default route or &quot;default gateway&quot;) and contributed to many others (including BIND).

However, the thousand-line ping, which he wrote in December 1983 while working at the Ballistic Research Laboratory, is the program for which he is most remembered. Due to its usefulness, ping has been implemented on a large number of operating systems, initially Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) and Unix, but later others including Windows and Mac OS X.

In 1993, the USENIX Association gave a Lifetime Achievement Award (&quot;Flame&quot;) to the Computer Systems Research Group at University of California, Berkeley, honoring 180 individuals, including Muuss, who contributed to the CSRG&#x27;s 4.4BSD-Lite release.

Muuss is mentioned in two books, &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg&quot; () and &quot;Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier&quot; (), for his role in tracking down crackers. He is also mentioned in Peter Salus&#x27;s &quot;A Quarter Century of UNIX&quot; and a link to his website’s ping page is included in &quot;How Linux Works&quot; ().

Muuss died in an automobile collision on Interstate 95 on November 20, 2000. The Michael J. Muuss Research Award, set up by friends and family of Muuss, memorializes him at Johns Hopkins University.

<doc id="20151" wikidata="Q624004" url="?curid=20151" title="Mousse">
<text>A mousse (, ; ) is a soft prepared food that incorporates air bubbles to give it a light and airy texture. Depending on preparation techniques, it can range from light and fluffy to creamy and thick. A mousse may be sweet or savory.

Sweet mousses are typically made with whipped egg whites, whipped cream, or both, and flavored with one or more of chocolate, coffee, caramel, puréed fruits, or various herbs and spices, such as mint or vanilla. In the case of some chocolate mousses, egg yolks are often stirred into melted chocolate to give the final product a richer mouthfeel. Mousses are also typically chilled before being served, which gives them a denser texture. Additionally, mousses are often frozen into silicone molds and unmolded to give the mousse a defined shape. Sweetened mousse is served as a dessert or used as an airy cake filling. It is sometimes stabilized with gelatin.

Savory mousses can be made from meat, fish, shellfish, foie gras, cheese, or vegetables. Hot mousses often get their light texture from the addition of beaten egg whites.

==History==

Various desserts consisting of whipped cream in pyramidal shapes with coffee, liqueurs, chocolate, fruits, and so on either in the mixture or poured on top were called (&#x27;cream in a foam&#x27;), (&#x27;foamy cream&#x27;), (&#x27;foam&#x27;), and so on, as early as 1768. Modern mousses are a continuation of this tradition.

==Savory mousse==
Molded and shaped fish mousse with bread and butter remains a popular meal of American cuisine, if not a party dip, although it is not as common as it was in the 1950s.
