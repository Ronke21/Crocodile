<text>Phonology is the branch of linguistics that studies how languages systematically organize their phonemes or, for sign languages, their constituent parts of signs. The term can also refer specifically to the sound or sign system of a particular language variety. At one time, the study of phonology related only to the study of the systems of phonemes in spoken languages, but now it may relate to any linguistic analysis either:

Sign languages have a phonological system equivalent to the system of sounds in spoken languages. The building blocks of signs are specifications for movement, location, and handshape. At first, a separate terminology was used for the study of sign phonology (&quot;chereme&quot; instead of &quot;phoneme&quot;, etc.), but the concepts are now considered to apply universally to all human languages.

== Terminology ==
The word &quot;phonology&quot; (as in &quot;phonology of English&quot;) can refer either to the field of study or to the phonological system of a given language. This is one of the fundamental systems that a language is considered to comprise, like its syntax, its morphology and its lexicon. The word &quot;phonology&quot; comes from Ancient Greek , &quot;phōnḗ&quot;, &#x27;voice, sound&#x27;, and the suffix &quot;-logy&quot; (which is from Greek , &quot;lógos&quot;, &#x27;word, speech, subject of discussion&#x27;).

Phonology is typically distinguished from phonetics, which concerns the physical production, acoustic transmission and perception of the sounds or signs of language. Phonology describes the way they function within a given language or across languages to encode meaning. For many linguists, phonetics belongs to descriptive linguistics and phonology to theoretical linguistics, but establishing the phonological system of a language is necessarily an application of theoretical principles to analysis of phonetic evidence in some theories. The distinction was not always made, particularly before the development of the modern concept of the phoneme in the mid-20th century. Some subfields of modern phonology have a crossover with phonetics in descriptive disciplines such as psycholinguistics and speech perception, which result in specific areas like articulatory phonology or laboratory phonology.

Definitions of the field of phonology vary. Nikolai Trubetzkoy in &quot;Grundzüge der Phonologie&quot; (1939) defines phonology as &quot;the study of sound pertaining to the system of language,&quot; as opposed to phonetics, which is &quot;the study of sound pertaining to the act of speech&quot; (the distinction between &quot;language&quot; and &quot;speech&quot; being basically Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s distinction between &quot;langue&quot; and &quot;parole&quot;). More recently, Lass (1998) writes that phonology refers broadly to the subdiscipline of linguistics concerned with the sounds of language, and in more narrow terms, &quot;phonology proper is concerned with the function, behavior and organization of sounds as linguistic items.&quot; According to Clark &quot;et al.&quot; (2007), it means the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken human language, or the field of linguistics studying that use.

== History ==
Early evidence for a systematic study of the sounds in a language appears in the 4th century BCE &quot;Ashtadhyayi&quot;, a Sanskrit grammar composed by Pāṇini. In particular, the &quot;Shiva Sutras&quot;, an auxiliary text to the &quot;Ashtadhyayi&quot;, introduces what may be considered a list of the phonemes of Sanskrit, with a notational system for them that is used throughout the main text, which deals with matters of morphology, syntax and semantics.

Ibn Jinni of Mosul, a pioneer in phonology, wrote prolifically in the 10th century on Arabic morphology and phonology in works such as &quot;Kitāb Al-Munṣif, Kitāb Al-Muḥtasab,&quot; and &quot; &quot;.

The study of phonology as it exists today is defined by the formative studies of the 19th-century Polish scholar Jan Baudouin de Courtenay, who (together with his students Mikołaj Kruszewski and Lev Shcherba in the Kazan School) shaped the modern usage of the term &quot;phoneme&quot; in a series of lectures in 1876–1877. The word &quot;phoneme&quot; had been coined a few years earlier, in 1873, by the French linguist A. Dufriche-Desgenettes. In a paper read at 24 May meeting of the Société de Linguistique de Paris, Dufriche-Desgenettes proposed for &quot;phoneme&quot; to serve as a one-word equivalent for the German &quot;Sprachlaut&quot;. Baudouin de Courtenay&#x27;s subsequent work, though often unacknowledged, is considered to be the starting point of modern phonology. He also worked on the theory of phonetic alternations (what is now called allophony and morphophonology) and may have had an influence on the work of Saussure, according to E. F. K. Koerner.

An influential school of phonology in the interwar period was the Prague school. One of its leading members was Prince Nikolai Trubetzkoy, whose &quot;Grundzüge der Phonologie&quot; (&quot;Principles of Phonology&quot;), published posthumously in 1939, is among the most important works in the field from that period. Directly influenced by Baudouin de Courtenay, Trubetzkoy is considered the founder of morphophonology, but the concept had also been recognized by de Courtenay. Trubetzkoy also developed the concept of the &quot;archiphoneme&quot;. Another important figure in the Prague school was Roman Jakobson, one of the most prominent linguists of the 20th century. Louis Hjelmslev&#x27;s glossematics also contributed with a focus on linguistic structure independent of phonetic realization or semantics.

In 1968, Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle published &quot;The Sound Pattern of English&quot; (SPE), the basis for generative phonology. In that view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. The features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.

Natural phonology is a theory based on the publications of its proponent David Stampe in 1969 and, more explicitly, in 1979. In this view, phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another; those that are active and those that are suppressed is language-specific. Rather than acting on segments, phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups. Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance. Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously, but the output of one process may be the input to another. The second most prominent natural phonologist is Patricia Donegan, Stampe&#x27;s wife; there are many natural phonologists in Europe and a few in the US, such as Geoffrey Nathan. The principles of natural phonology were extended to morphology by Wolfgang U. Dressler, who founded natural morphology.

In 1976, John Goldsmith introduced autosegmental phonology. Phonological phenomena are no longer seen as operating on &quot;one&quot; linear sequence of segments, called phonemes or feature combinations but rather as involving &quot;some parallel sequences&quot; of features that reside on multiple tiers. Autosegmental phonology later evolved into feature geometry, which became the standard theory of representation for theories of the organization of phonology as different as lexical phonology and optimality theory.

Government phonology, which originated in the early 1980s as an attempt to unify theoretical notions of syntactic and phonological structures, is based on the notion that all languages necessarily follow a small set of principles and vary according to their selection of certain binary parameters. That is, all languages&#x27; phonological structures are essentially the same, but there is restricted variation that accounts for differences in surface realizations. Principles are held to be inviolable, but parameters may sometimes come into conflict. Prominent figures in this field include Jonathan Kaye, Jean Lowenstamm, Jean-Roger Vergnaud, Monik Charette, and John Harris.

In a course at the LSA summer institute in 1991, Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky developed optimality theory, an overall architecture for phonology according to which languages choose a pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints ordered by importance; a lower-ranked constraint can be violated when the violation is necessary in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint. The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince and has become a dominant trend in phonology. The appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements (e.g. features) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of &quot;substance-free phonology&quot;, especially by Mark Hale and Charles Reiss.

An integrated approach to phonological theory that combines synchronic and diachronic accounts to sound patterns was initiated with Evolutionary Phonology in recent years.

== Analysis of phonemes ==

An important part of traditional, pre-generative schools of phonology is studying which sounds can be grouped into distinctive units within a language; these units are known as phonemes. For example, in English, the &quot;p&quot; sound in &quot;pot&quot; is aspirated (pronounced ) while that in &quot;spot&quot; is not aspirated (pronounced ). However, English speakers intuitively treat both sounds as variations (allophones, which cannot give origin to minimal pairs) of the same phonological category, that is of the phoneme . (Traditionally, it would be argued that if an aspirated were interchanged with the unaspirated in &quot;spot&quot;, native speakers of English would still hear the same words; that is, the two sounds are perceived as &quot;the same&quot; .) In some other languages, however, these two sounds are perceived as different, and they are consequently assigned to different phonemes. For example, in Thai, Bengali, and Quechua, there are minimal pairs of words for which aspiration is the only contrasting feature (two words can have different meanings but with the only difference in pronunciation being that one has an aspirated sound where the other has an unaspirated one).

Part of the phonological study of a language therefore involves looking at data (phonetic transcriptions of the speech of native speakers) and trying to deduce what the underlying phonemes are and what the sound inventory of the language is. The presence or absence of minimal pairs, as mentioned above, is a frequently used criterion for deciding whether two sounds should be assigned to the same phoneme. However, other considerations often need to be taken into account as well.

The particular contrasts which are phonemic in a language can change over time. At one time, and , two sounds that have the same place and manner of articulation and differ in voicing only, were allophones of the same phoneme in English, but later came to belong to separate phonemes. This is one of the main factors of historical change of languages as described in historical linguistics.

The findings and insights of speech perception and articulation research complicate the traditional and somewhat intuitive idea of interchangeable allophones being perceived as the same phoneme. First, interchanged allophones of the same phoneme can result in unrecognizable words. Second, actual speech, even at a word level, is highly co-articulated, so it is problematic to expect to be able to splice words into simple segments without affecting speech perception.

Different linguists therefore take different approaches to the problem of assigning sounds to phonemes. For example, they differ in the extent to which they require allophones to be phonetically similar. There are also differing ideas as to whether this grouping of sounds is purely a tool for linguistic analysis, or reflects an actual process in the way the human brain processes a language.

Since the early 1960s, theoretical linguists have moved away from the traditional concept of a phoneme, preferring to consider basic units at a more abstract level, as a component of morphemes; these units can be called &quot;morphophonemes&quot;, and analysis using this approach is called morphophonology.

== Other topics ==

In addition to the minimal units that can serve the purpose of differentiating meaning (the phonemes), phonology studies how sounds alternate, or replace one another in different forms of the same morpheme (allomorphs), as well as, for example, syllable structure, stress, feature geometry, tone, and intonation.

Phonology also includes topics such as phonotactics (the phonological constraints on what sounds can appear in what positions in a given language) and phonological alternation (how the pronunciation of a sound changes through the application of phonological rules, sometimes in a given order that can be feeding or bleeding,) as well as prosody, the study of suprasegmentals and topics such as stress and intonation.

The principles of phonological analysis can be applied independently of modality because they are designed to serve as general analytical tools, not language-specific ones. The same principles have been applied to the analysis of sign languages (see Phonemes in sign languages), even though the sublexical units are not instantiated as speech sounds.

<text>In Greek mythology, Prometheus (; , , possibly meaning &quot;forethought&quot;) is a god of fire. Prometheus is best known for defying the Olympian gods by taking fire from them and giving it to humanity in the form of technology, knowledge and, more generally, civilization.

In some versions of the myth, he is also credited with the creation of humanity from clay. Prometheus is known for his intelligence and for being a champion of mankind and is also generally seen as the author of the human arts and sciences. He is sometimes presented as the father of Deucalion, the hero of the flood story.

The punishment of Prometheus for stealing fire from Olympus and giving it to humans is a subject of both ancient and modern culture. Zeus, king of the Olympian gods, condemned Prometheus to eternal torment for his transgression. Prometheus was bound to a rock, and an eagle — the emblem of Zeus — was sent to eat his liver (in ancient Greece, the liver was thought to be the seat of human emotions). His liver would then grow back overnight, only to be eaten again the next day in an ongoing cycle. According to several major versions of the myth, most notably that of Hesiod, Prometheus was eventually freed by the hero Heracles. The struggle of Prometheus is located by some at Mount Elbrus or at Mount Kazbek, two volcanic promontories in the Caucasus Mountains beyond which for the ancient Greeks lay the realm of the &quot;barbari&quot;.

In another myth, Prometheus establishes the form of animal sacrifice practiced in ancient Greek religion. Evidence of a cult to Prometheus himself is not widespread. He was a focus of religious activity mainly at Athens, where he was linked to Athena and Hephaestus, who were the Greek deities of creative skills and technology.

In the Western classical tradition, Prometheus became a figure who represented human striving (particularly the quest for scientific knowledge) and the risk of overreaching or unintended consequences. In particular, he was regarded in the Romantic era as embodying the lone genius whose efforts to improve human existence could also result in tragedy: Mary Shelley, for instance, gave &quot;The Modern Prometheus&quot; as the subtitle to her novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818).

==Etymology==
The etymology of the theonym &quot;prometheus&quot; is debated. The usual view is that it signifies &quot;forethought&quot;, as that of his brother Epimetheus denotes &quot;afterthought&quot;. Hesychius of Alexandria gives Prometheus the variant name of Ithas, and adds &quot;whom others call Ithax&quot;, and describes him as the Herald of the Titans. Kerényi remarks that these names are &quot;not transparent&quot;, and may be different readings of the same name, while the name &quot;Prometheus&quot; is descriptive.

It has also been theorised that it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root that also produces the Vedic &quot;pra math&quot;, &quot;to steal&quot;, hence &quot;pramathyu-s&quot;, &quot;thief&quot;, cognate with &quot;Prometheus&quot;, the thief of fire. The Vedic myth of fire&#x27;s theft by Mātariśvan is an analogue to the Greek account. &quot;Pramant&quot; was the fire-drill, the tool used to create fire. The suggestion that Prometheus was in origin the human &quot;inventor of the fire-sticks, from which fire is kindled&quot; goes back to Diodorus Siculus in the first century BC. The reference is again to the &quot;fire-drill&quot;, a worldwide primitive method of fire making using a vertical and a horizontal piece of wood to produce fire by friction.

== Myths and legends ==

===Possible sources===

The oldest record of Prometheus is in Hesiod, but stories of theft of fire by a trickster figure are widespread around the world. Some other aspects of the story resemble the Sumerian myth of Enki (or Ea in later Babylonian mythology), who was also a bringer of civilisation who protected humanity against the other gods, including during the great flood, as well as created man from clay. While the theory lost favour in the 20th century that Prometheus descends from the Vedic fire bringer Mātariśvan, it was suggested in the 19th century and is still supported by some.

=== Oldest legends ===

====Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; and &quot;Works and Days&quot;====

=====&quot;Theogony&quot;=====
The first recorded account of the Prometheus myth appeared in the late 8th-century BC Greek epic poet Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;. In that account, Prometheus was a son of the Titan Iapetus by Clymene or Asia, one of the Oceanids. He was brother to Menoetius, Atlas, and Epimetheus. Hesiod, in &quot;Theogony&quot;, introduces Prometheus as a lowly challenger to Zeus&#x27;s omniscience and omnipotence.

In the trick at Mecone, a sacrificial meal marking the &quot;settling of accounts&quot; between mortals and immortals, Prometheus played a trick against Zeus. He placed two sacrificial offerings before the Olympian: a selection of beef hidden inside an ox&#x27;s stomach (nourishment hidden inside a displeasing exterior), and the bull&#x27;s bones wrapped completely in &quot;glistening fat&quot; (something inedible hidden inside a pleasing exterior). Zeus chose the latter, setting a precedent for future sacrifices. Henceforth, humans would keep that meat for themselves and burn the bones wrapped in fat as an offering to the gods. This angered Zeus, who hid fire from humans in retribution. In this version of the myth, the use of fire was already known to humans, but withdrawn by Zeus.

Prometheus stole fire back from Zeus in a fennel stalk and restored it to humanity. This further enraged Zeus, who sent the first woman to live with humanity (Pandora, not explicitly mentioned). The woman, a &quot;shy maiden&quot;, was fashioned by Hephaestus out of clay and Athena helped to adorn her properly. Hesiod writes, &quot;From her is the race of women and female kind: of her is the deadly race and tribe of women who live amongst mortal men to their great trouble, no helpmeets in hateful poverty, but only in wealth&quot;. For his crimes, Prometheus was punished by Zeus, who bound him with chains and sent an eagle to eat Prometheus&#x27; immortal liver every day, which then grew back every night. Years later, the Greek hero Heracles, with Zeus&#x27; permission, killed the eagle and freed Prometheus from this torment.
===== &quot;Works and Days&quot; =====
Hesiod revisits the story of Prometheus and the theft of fire in &quot;Works and Days&quot;. In it the poet expands upon Zeus&#x27;s reaction to Prometheus&#x27; deception. Not only does Zeus withhold fire from humanity, but &quot;the means of life&quot; as well. Had Prometheus not provoked Zeus&#x27;s wrath, &quot;you would easily do work enough in a day to supply you for a full year even without working; soon would you put away your rudder over the smoke, and the fields worked by ox and sturdy mule would run to waste&quot;.

Hesiod also adds more information to &quot;Theogony&quot;″s story of the first woman, a maiden crafted from earth and water by Hephaestus now explicitly called Pandora (&quot;all gifts&quot;). Zeus in this case gets the help of Athena, Aphrodite, Hermes, the Graces and the Hours. After Prometheus steals the fire, Zeus sends Pandora in retaliation. Despite Prometheus&#x27; warning, Epimetheus accepts this &quot;gift&quot; from the gods. Pandora carried a jar with her from which were released mischief and sorrow, plague and diseases. Pandora shuts the lid of the jar too late to contain all the evil plights that escaped, but Hope is left trapped in the jar because Zeus forces Pandora to seal it up before Hope can escape.

=====Interpretation=====
Casanova (1979), finds in Prometheus a reflection of an ancient, pre-Hesiodic trickster-figure, who served to account for the mixture of good and bad in human life, and whose fashioning of humanity from clay was an Eastern motif familiar in &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;. As an opponent of Zeus, the titan Prometheus can be seen as characteristic of the titans in general, and like other titans, was punished for his opposition. As an advocate for humanity he gains semi-divine status at Athens, where the episode in &quot;Theogony&quot; in which he is liberated is interpreted by Casanova as a post-Hesiodic interpolation.

According to the classicist Karl-Martin Dietz, in Hesiod&#x27;s scriptures, Prometheus represents the &quot;descent of mankind from the communion with the gods into the present troublesome life&quot;.

====The Lost Titanomachy====
The Titanomachy is a lost epic of the cosmological struggle between the Greek gods and their parents, the Titans, and, in addition to the works of Hesiod, is a probable source of the Prometheus myth. Its reputed author was supposed to have lived in the 8th century BC, but M. L. West has argued that it can&#x27;t be earlier than the late 7th century BC. Presumably included in the Titanomachy is the story of Prometheus, himself a Titan, who managed to avoid being in the direct confrontational cosmic battle between Zeus and the other Olympians against Cronus and the other Titans (although there is no direct evidence of Prometheus&#x27; inclusion in the epic). M. L. West notes that surviving references suggest that there may have been significant differences between the Titanomachy epic and the account of events in Hesiod; and that the Titanomachy may be the source of later variants of the Prometheus myth not found in Hesiod, notably the non-Hesiodic material found in the &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; of Aeschylus.

===Athenian tradition===
The two major authors to have an influence on the development of the myths and legends surrounding the Titan Prometheus during the Socratic era of greater Athens were Aeschylus and Plato. The two men wrote in highly distinctive forms of expression which for Aeschylus centered on his mastery of the literary form of Greek tragedy, while for Plato this centered on the philosophical expression of his thought in the form of the various dialogues he wrote during his lifetime.

==== Aeschylus and the ancient literary tradition ====
&quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, perhaps the most famous treatment of the myth to be found among the Greek tragedies, is traditionally attributed to the 5th-century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus. At the centre of the drama are the results of Prometheus&#x27; theft of fire and his current punishment by Zeus. The playwright&#x27;s dependence on the Hesiodic source material is clear, though &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; also includes a number of changes to the received tradition. It has been suggested by M.L. West that these changes may derive from the now lost epic Titanomachy.

Before his theft of fire, Prometheus played a decisive role in the Titanomachy, securing victory for Zeus and the other Olympians. Zeus&#x27; torture of Prometheus thus becomes a particularly harsh betrayal. The scope and character of Prometheus&#x27; transgressions against Zeus are also widened. In addition to giving humanity fire, Prometheus claims to have taught them the arts of civilisation, such as writing, mathematics, agriculture, medicine, and science. His greatest benefaction for humanity seems to have been saving them from complete destruction. In an apparent twist on the myth of the so-called Five Ages of Man found in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot; (wherein Cronus and, later, Zeus created and destroyed five successive races of humanity), Prometheus asserts that Zeus had wanted to obliterate the human race, but that he somehow stopped him.
Moreover, Aeschylus anachronistically and artificially injects Io, another victim of Zeus&#x27;s violence and ancestor of Heracles, into Prometheus&#x27; story. Finally, just as Aeschylus gave Prometheus a key role in bringing Zeus to power, he also attributed to him secret knowledge that could lead to Zeus&#x27;s downfall: Prometheus had been told by his mother Themis, who in the play is identified with Gaia (Earth), of a potential marriage that would produce a son who would overthrow Zeus. Fragmentary evidence indicates that Heracles, as in Hesiod, frees the Titan in the trilogy&#x27;s second play, &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;. It is apparently not until Prometheus reveals this secret of Zeus&#x27;s potential downfall that the two reconcile in the final play, &quot;Prometheus the Fire-Bringer&quot; or &quot;Prometheus Pyrphoros&quot;, a lost tragedy by Aeschylus.

&quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; also includes two mythic innovations of omission. The first is the absence of Pandora&#x27;s story in connection with Prometheus&#x27; own. Instead, Aeschylus includes this one oblique allusion to Pandora and her jar that contained Hope (252): &quot;[Prometheus] caused blind hopes to live in the hearts of men.&quot; Second, Aeschylus makes no mention of the sacrifice-trick played against Zeus in the &quot;Theogony&quot;. The four tragedies of Prometheus attributed to Aeschylus, most of which are lost to the passages of time into antiquity, are &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; (&quot;Prometheus Desmotes&quot;), &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; (&quot;Lyomenos&quot;), &quot;Prometheus the Fire Bringer&quot; (&quot;Pyrphoros&quot;), and &quot;Prometheus the Fire Kindler&quot; (&quot;Pyrkaeus&quot;).

The larger scope of Aeschylus as a dramatist revisiting the myth of Prometheus in the age of Athenian prominence has been discussed by William Lynch. Lynch&#x27;s general thesis concerns the rise of humanist and secular tendencies in Athenian culture and society which required the growth and expansion of the mythological and religious tradition as acquired from the most ancient sources of the myth stemming from Hesiod. For Lynch, modern scholarship is hampered by not having the full trilogy of Prometheus by Aeschylus, the last two parts of which have been lost to antiquity. Significantly, Lynch further comments that although the Prometheus trilogy is not available, the &quot;Orestia&quot; trilogy by Aeschylus remains available and may be assumed to provide significant insight into the overall structural intentions which may be ascribed to the Prometheus trilogy by Aeschylus as an author of significant consistency and exemplary dramatic erudition.

Harold Bloom, in his research guide for Aeschylus, has summarised some of the critical attention that has been applied to Aeschylus concerning his general philosophical import in Athens. As Bloom states, &quot;Much critical attention has been paid to the question of theodicy in Aeschylus. For generations, scholars warred incessantly over &#x27;the justice of Zeus,&#x27; unintentionally blurring it with a monotheism imported from Judeo-Christian thought. The playwright undoubtedly had religious concerns; for instance, Jacqueline de Romilly suggests that his treatment of time flows directly out of his belief in divine justice. But it would be an error to think of Aeschylus as sermonising. His Zeus does not arrive at decisions which he then enacts in the mortal world; rather, human events are themselves an enactment of divine will.&quot;

According to Thomas Rosenmeyer, regarding the religious import of Aeschylus, &quot;In Aeschylus, as in Homer, the two levels of causation, the supernatural and the human, are co-existent and simultaneous, two ways of describing the same event.&quot; Rosenmeyer insists that ascribing portrayed characters in Aeschylus should not conclude them to be either victims or agents of theological or religious activity too quickly. As Rosenmeyer states: &quot;[T]he text defines their being. For a critic to construct an Aeschylean theology would be as quixotic as designing a typology of Aeschylean man. The needs of the drama prevail.&quot;

In a rare comparison of Prometheus in Aeschylus with Oedipus in Sophocles, Harold Bloom states that &quot;Freud called &quot;Oedipus&quot; an &#x27;immoral play,&#x27; since the gods ordained incest and parricide. Oedipus therefore participates in our universal unconscious sense of guilt, but on this reading so do the gods&quot; [...] &quot;I sometimes wish that Freud had turned to Aeschylus instead, and given us the Prometheus complex rather than the Oedipus complex.&quot;

Karl-Martin Dietz states that in contrast to Hesiod&#x27;s, in Aeschylus&#x27; oeuvre, Prometheus stands for the &quot;Ascent of humanity from primitive beginnings to the present level of civilisation.&quot;

====Plato and philosophy====
Olga Raggio, in her study &quot;The Myth of Prometheus&quot;, attributes Plato in the &quot;Protagoras&quot; as an important contributor to the early development of the Prometheus myth. Raggio indicates that many of the more challenging and dramatic assertions which Aeschylean tragedy explores are absent from Plato&#x27;s writings about Prometheus.

As summarised by Raggio, Raggio then goes on to point out Plato&#x27;s distinction of creative power (&quot;techne&quot;), which is presented as superior to merely natural instincts (&quot;physis&quot;).

For Plato, only the virtues of &quot;reverence and justice can provide for the maintenance of a civilised society – and these virtues are the highest gift finally bestowed on men in equal measure&quot;. The ancients by way of Plato believed that the name &quot;Prometheus&quot; derived from the Greek prefix &quot;pro&quot;- (before) + &quot;manthano&quot; (intelligence) and the agent suffix -&quot;eus&quot;, thus meaning &quot;Forethinker&quot;.

In his dialogue titled &quot;Protagoras&quot;, Plato contrasts Prometheus with his dull-witted brother Epimetheus, &quot;Afterthinker&quot;. In Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Protagoras&quot;, Protagoras asserts that the gods created humans and all the other animals, but it was left to Prometheus and his brother Epimetheus to give defining attributes to each. As no physical traits were left when the pair came to humans, Prometheus decided to give them fire and other civilising arts.

==== Athenian religious dedication and observance ====
It is understandable that since Prometheus was considered a Titan (distinct from an Olympian) that there would be an absence of evidence, with the exception of Athens, for the direct religious devotion to his worship. Despite his importance to the myths and imaginative literature of ancient Greece, the religious cult of Prometheus during the Archaic and Classical periods seems to have been limited. Writing in the 2nd century AD, the satirist Lucian points out that while temples for the major Olympians were everywhere, none for Prometheus is to be seen.

Athens was the exception; here Prometheus was worshipped alongside Athena and Hephaestus. The altar of Prometheus in the grove of the Academy was the point of origin for several significant processions and other events regularly observed on the Athenian calendar. For the Panathenaic festival, arguably the most important civic festival at Athens, a torch race began at the altar, which was located outside the sacred boundary of the city, and passed through the Kerameikos, the district inhabited by potters and other artisans who regarded Prometheus and Hephaestus as patrons. The race then travelled to the heart of the city, where it kindled the sacrificial fire on the altar of Athena on the Acropolis to conclude the festival. These footraces took the form of relays in which teams of runners passed off a flaming torch. According to Pausanias (2nd century AD), the torch relay, called &quot;lampadedromia&quot; or &quot;lampadephoria&quot;, was first instituted at Athens in honour of Prometheus.

By the Classical period, the races were run by ephebes also in honour of Hephaestus and Athena. Prometheus&#x27; association with fire is the key to his religious significance and to the alignment with Athena and Hephaestus that was specific to Athens and its &quot;unique degree of cultic emphasis&quot; on honouring technology. The festival of Prometheus was the Prometheia (τὰ Προμήθεια). The wreaths worn symbolised the chains of Prometheus. There is a pattern of resemblances between Hephaestus and Prometheus. Although the classical tradition is that Hephaestus split Zeus&#x27;s head to allow Athena&#x27;s birth, that story has also been told of Prometheus. A variant tradition makes Prometheus the son of Hera like Hephaestus. According to that version, the Giant Eurymedon raped Hera when she was young, and she had Prometheus. After Zeus married Hera, he threw Eurymedon into Tartarus and punished Prometheus in Caucasus, using the theft of fire as an excuse. Ancient artists depict Prometheus wearing the pointed cap of an artist or artisan, like Hephaestus, and also the crafty hero Odysseus. The artisan&#x27;s cap was also depicted as worn by the Cabeiri, supernatural craftsmen associated with a mystery cult known in Athens in classical times, and who were associated with both Hephaestus and Prometheus. Kerényi suggests that Hephaestus may in fact be the &quot;successor&quot; of Prometheus, despite Hephaestus being himself of archaic origin.

Pausanias recorded a few other religious sites in Greece devoted to Prometheus. Both Argos and Opous claimed to be Prometheus&#x27; final resting place, each erecting a tomb in his honour. The Greek city of Panopeus had a cult statue that was supposed to honour Prometheus for having created the human race there.

====Aesthetic tradition in Athenian art====
Prometheus&#x27; torment by the eagle and his rescue by Heracles were popular subjects in vase paintings of the 6th to 4th centuries BC. He also sometimes appears in depictions of Athena&#x27;s birth from Zeus&#x27; forehead. There was a relief sculpture of Prometheus with Pandora on the base of Athena&#x27;s cult statue in the Athenian Parthenon of the 5th century BC. A similar rendering is also found at the great altar of Zeus at Pergamon from the second century BC.

The event of the release of Prometheus from captivity was frequently revisited on Attic and Etruscan vases between the sixth and fifth centuries BC. In the depiction on display at the Museum of Karlsruhe and in Berlin, the depiction is that of Prometheus confronted by a menacing large bird (assumed to be the eagle) with Heracles approaching from behind shooting his arrows at it. In the fourth century this imagery was modified to depicting Prometheus bound in a cruciform manner, possibly reflecting an Aeschylus-inspired manner of influence, again with an eagle and with Heracles approaching from the side.

=== Other authors ===

Some two dozen other Greek and Roman authors retold and further embellished the Prometheus myth from as early as the 5th century BC (Diodorus, Herodorus) into the 4th century AD. The most significant detail added to the myth found in, e.g., Sappho, Aesop and Ovid was the central role of Prometheus in the creation of the human race. According to these sources, Prometheus fashioned humans out of clay.

Although perhaps made explicit in the &quot;Prometheia&quot;, later authors such as Hyginus, the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, and Quintus of Smyrna would confirm that Prometheus warned Zeus not to marry the sea nymph Thetis. She is consequently married off to the mortal Peleus, and bears him a son greater than the father – Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan War. Pseudo-Apollodorus moreover clarifies a cryptic statement (1026–29) made by Hermes in &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, identifying the centaur Chiron as the one who would take on Prometheus&#x27; suffering and die in his place. Reflecting a myth attested in Greek vase paintings from the Classical period, Pseudo-Apollodorus places the Titan (armed with an axe) at the birth of Athena, thus explaining how the goddess sprang forth from the forehead of Zeus.

Other minor details attached to the myth include: the duration of Prometheus&#x27; torment; the origin of the eagle that ate the Titan&#x27;s liver (found in Pseudo-Apollodorus and Hyginus); Pandora&#x27;s marriage to Epimetheus (found in Pseudo-Apollodorus); myths surrounding the life of Prometheus&#x27; son, Deucalion (found in Ovid and Apollonius of Rhodes); and Prometheus&#x27; marginal role in the myth of Jason and the Argonauts (found in Apollonius of Rhodes and Valerius Flaccus).

&quot;Variants of legends containing the Prometheus motif are widespread in the Caucasus&quot; region, reports Hunt, who gave ten stories related to Prometheus from ethno-linguistic groups in the region.

Prometheus finally makes an appearance in Athenian playwright Aristophanes&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Birds&quot;, where he is seen living on Mount Olympus after the end of his long torture, apparently having reconciled with the other gods. He is presented not as the dauntless rebel who questioned Zeus, but rather as a timid god who goes to negotiate with the titular Birds disguised, so that Zeus will not notice him talking to the enemy.

Zahhak, an evil figure in Iranian mythology, also ends up eternally chained on a mountainside – though the rest of his career is dissimilar to that of Prometheus.

==Late Roman antiquity==
The three most prominent aspects of the Prometheus myth have parallels within the beliefs of many cultures. &quot;The Prometheus myth of creation as a visual symbol of the Neoplatonic concept of human nature, illustrated in (many) sarcophagi, was evidently a contradiction of the Christian teaching of the unique and simultaneous act of creation by the Trinity.&quot; This Neoplatonism of late Roman antiquity was especially stressed by Tertullian who recognised both difference and similarity of the biblical deity with the mythological figure of Prometheus.

The imagery of Prometheus and the creation of man used for the purposes of the representation of the creation of Adam in biblical symbolism is also a recurrent theme in the artistic expression of late Roman antiquity. Of the relatively rare expressions found of the creation of Adam in those centuries of late Roman antiquity, one can single out the so-called &quot;Dogma sarcophagus&quot; of the Lateran Museum where three figures (commonly taken to represent the theological trinity) are seen in making a benediction to the new man. Another example is found where the prototype of Prometheus is also recognisable in the early Christian era of late Roman antiquity. This can be found upon a sarcophagus of the Church at Mas d&#x27;Aire as well, and in an even more direct comparison to what Raggio refers to as &quot;a coarsely carved relief from Campli (Teramo) (where) the Lord sits on a throne and models the body of Adam, exactly like Prometheus&quot;. Still another such similarity is found in the example found on a Hellenistic relief presently in the Louvre in which the Lord gives life to Eve through the imposition of his two fingers on her eyes recalling the same gesture found in earlier representations of Prometheus.

In Georgian mythology, Amirani is a cultural hero who challenged the chief god and, like Prometheus, was chained on the Caucasian mountains where birds would eat his organs. This aspect of the myth had a significant influence on the Greek imagination. It is recognisable from a Greek gem roughly dated to the time of the Hesiod poems, which show Prometheus with hands bound behind his body and crouching before a bird with long wings. This same image would also be used later in the Rome of the Augustan age as documented by Furtwangler.

In the often cited and highly publicised interview between Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers on Public Television, the author of &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; presented his view on the comparison of Prometheus and Jesus. Moyers asked Campbell the question in the following words, &quot;In this sense, unlike heroes such as Prometheus or Jesus, we&#x27;re not going on our journey to save the world but to save ourselves.&quot; To which Campbell&#x27;s well-known response was that, &quot;But in doing that, you save the world. The influence of a vital person vitalizes, there&#x27;s no doubt about it. The world without spirit is a wasteland. People have the notion of saving the world by shifting things around, changing the rules [...] No, no! Any world is a valid world if it&#x27;s alive. The thing to do is to bring life to it, and the only way to do that is to find in your own case where the life is and become alive yourself.&quot; For Campbell, Jesus suffered mortally on the Cross while Prometheus suffered eternally while chained to a rock, and each of them received punishment for the gift which they bestowed to humankind, for Jesus this was the gift of propitiation from Heaven, and, for Prometheus this was the gift of fire from Olympus.

It remains a continuing debate among scholars of comparative religion and the literary reception of mythological and religious subject matter as to whether the typology of suffering and torment represented in the Prometheus myth finds its more representative comparisons with the narratives of the Hebrew scriptures or with the New Testament narratives. In the Book of Job, significant comparisons can be drawn between the sustained suffering of Job in comparison to that of eternal suffering and torment represented in the Prometheus myth. With Job, the suffering is at the acquiescence of heaven and at the will of the demonic, while in Prometheus the suffering is directly linked to Zeus as the ruler of Olympus. The comparison of the suffering of Jesus after his sentencing in Jerusalem is limited to the three days, from Thursday to Saturday, and leading to the culminating narratives corresponding to Easter Sunday. The symbolic import for comparative religion would maintain that suffering related to justified conduct is redeemed in both the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament narratives, while in Prometheus there remains the image of a non-forgiving deity, Zeus, who nonetheless requires reverence.

Writing in late antiquity of the fourth and fifth century, the Latin commentator Marcus Servius Honoratus explained that Prometheus was so named because he was a man of great foresight &quot;(vir prudentissimus)&quot;, possessing the abstract quality of &quot;providentia&quot;, the Latin equivalent of Greek &quot;promētheia&quot; (). Anecdotally, the Roman fabulist Phaedrus (c. 15 BC – c. 50 AD) attributes to Aesop a simple etiology for homosexuality, in Prometheus&#x27; getting drunk while creating the first humans and misapplying the genitalia.

==Middle Ages==
Perhaps the most influential book of the Middle Ages upon the reception of the Prometheus myth was the mythological handbook of Fulgentius Placiades. As stated by Raggio, &quot;The text of Fulgentius, as well as that of (Marcus) Servius [...] are the main sources of the mythological handbooks written in the ninth century by the anonymous &quot;Mythographus Primus&quot; and &quot;Mythographus Secundus&quot;. Both were used for the more lengthy and elaborate compendium by the English scholar Alexander Neckman (1157–1217), the &quot;Scintillarium Poetarum&quot;, or &quot;Poetarius&quot;.&quot; The purpose of his books was to distinguish allegorical interpretation from the historical interpretation of the Prometheus myth. Continuing in this same tradition of the allegorical interpretation of the Prometheus myth, along with the historical interpretation of the Middle Ages, is the &quot;Genealogiae&quot; of Giovanni Boccaccio. Boccaccio follows these two levels of interpretation and distinguishes between two separate versions of the Prometheus myth. For Boccaccio, Prometheus is placed &quot;In the heavens where all is clarity and truth, [Prometheus] steals, so to speak, a ray of the divine wisdom from God himself, source of all Science, supreme Light of every man.&quot; With this, Boccaccio shows himself moving from the mediaeval sources with a shift of accent towards the attitude of the Renaissance humanists.

Using a similar interpretation to that of Boccaccio, Marsilio Ficino in the fifteenth century updated the philosophical and more sombre reception of the Prometheus myth not seen since the time of Plotinus. In his book written in 1476–77 titled &quot;Quaestiones Quinque de Mente&quot;, Ficino indicates his preference for reading the Prometheus myth as an image of the human soul seeking to obtain supreme truth. As Raggio summarises Ficino&#x27;s text, &quot;The torture of Prometheus is the torment brought by reason itself to man, who is made by it many times more unhappy than the brutes. It is after having stolen one beam of the celestial light [...] that the soul feels as if fastened by chains and [...] only death can release her bonds and carry her to the source of all knowledge.&quot; This sombreness of attitude in Ficino&#x27;s text would be further developed later by Charles de Bouelles&#x27; &quot;Liber de Sapiente&quot; of 1509 which presented a mix of both scholastic and Neoplatonic ideas.

==Renaissance==

After the writings of both Boccaccio and Ficino in the late Middle Ages about Prometheus, interest in the Titan shifted considerably in the direction of becoming subject matter for painters and sculptors alike. Among the most famous examples is that of Piero di Cosimo from about 1510 presently on display at the museums of Munich and Strasburg (see Inset). Raggio summarises the Munich version as follows; &quot;The Munich panel represents the dispute between Epimetheus and Prometheus, the handsome triumphant statue of the new man, modelled by Prometheus, his ascension to the sky under the guidance of Minerva; the Strasburg panel shows in the distance Prometheus lighting his torch at the wheels of the Sun, and in the foreground on one side, Prometheus applying his torch to the heart of the statue and, on the other, Mercury fastening him to a tree.&quot; All the details are evidently borrowed from Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Genealogiae&quot;.

The same reference to the &quot;Genealogiae&quot; can be cited as the source for the drawing by Parmigianino presently located in the Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York City. In the drawing, a very noble rendering of Prometheus is presented which evokes the memory of Michelangelo&#x27;s works portraying Jehovah. This drawing is perhaps one of the most intense examples of the visualisation of the myth of Prometheus from the Renaissance period.

Writing in the late British Renaissance, William Shakespeare uses the Promethean allusion in the famous death scene of Desdemona in his tragedy of &quot;Othello&quot;. Othello in contemplating the death of Desdemona asserts plainly that he cannot restore the &quot;Promethean heat&quot; to her body once it has been extinguished. For Shakespeare, the allusion is clearly to the interpretation of the fire from the heat as the bestowing of life to the creation of man from clay by Prometheus after it was stolen from Olympus. The analogy bears direct resemblance to the biblical narrative of the creation of life in Adam through the bestowed breathing of the creator in Genesis. Shakespeare&#x27;s symbolic reference to the &quot;heat&quot; associated with Prometheus&#x27; fire is to the association of the gift of fire to the mythological gift or theological gift of life to humans.

==Post-Renaissance==
The myth of Prometheus has been a favourite theme of Western art and literature in the post-renaissance and post-Enlightenment tradition and, occasionally, in works produced outside the West.

=== Post-Renaissance literary arts ===
For the Romantic era, Prometheus was the rebel who resisted all forms of institutional tyranny epitomised by Zeus – church, monarch, and patriarch. The Romantics drew comparisons between Prometheus and the spirit of the French Revolution, Christ, the Satan of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, and the divinely inspired poet or artist. Prometheus is the lyrical &quot;I&quot; who speaks in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; poem &quot;Prometheus&quot; (written c. 1772–74, published 1789), addressing God (as Zeus) in misotheist accusation and defiance. In &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; (1820), a four-act lyrical drama, Percy Bysshe Shelley rewrites the lost play of Aeschylus so that Prometheus does not submit to Zeus (under the Latin name Jupiter), but instead supplants him in a triumph of the human heart and intellect over tyrannical religion. Lord Byron&#x27;s poem &quot;Prometheus&quot; also portrays the Titan as unrepentant. As documented by Raggio, other leading figures among the great Romantics included Byron, Longfellow and Nietzsche as well. Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is subtitled &quot;The Modern Prometheus&quot;, in reference to the novel&#x27;s themes of the over-reaching of modern humanity into dangerous areas of knowledge.

====Goethe&#x27;s poems====

&quot;Prometheus&quot; is a poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in which a character based on the mythic Prometheus addresses God (as Zeus) in a romantic and misotheist tone of accusation and defiance. The poem was written between 1772 and 1774. It was first published fifteen years later in 1789. It is an important work as it represents one of the first encounters of the Prometheus myth with the literary Romantic movement identified with Goethe and with the Sturm und Drang movement.

The poem has appeared in Volume 6 of Goethe&#x27;s poems (in his Collected Works) in a section of &quot;&quot; (assorted poems), shortly following the &quot;Harzreise im Winter&quot;. It is immediately followed by &quot;Ganymed&quot;, and the two poems are written as informing each other according to Goethe&#x27;s plan in their actual writing. &quot;Prometheus&quot; (1774) was originally planned as a drama but never completed by Goethe, though the poem is inspired by it. Prometheus is the creative and rebellious spirit rejected by God and who angrily defies him and asserts himself. Ganymede, by direct contrast, is the boyish self who is both adored and seduced by God. As a high Romantic poet and a humanist poet, Goethe presents both identities as contrasting aspects of the Romantic human condition.

The poem offers direct biblical connotations for the Prometheus myth which was unseen in any of the ancient Greek poets dealing with the Prometheus myth in either drama, tragedy, or philosophy. The intentional use of the German phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;When I was a child&quot;): the use of &quot; is distinctive, and with it Goethe directly applies the Lutheran translation of Saint Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to the Corinthians, : &quot; (&quot;When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things&quot;). Goethe&#x27;s Prometheus is significant for the contrast it evokes with the biblical text of Corinthians rather than for its similarities.

In his book titled &quot;Prometheus: Archetypal Image of Human Existence&quot;, C. Kerényi states the key contrast between Goethe&#x27;s version of Prometheus with the ancient Greek version. As Kerényi states, &quot;Goethe&#x27;s Prometheus had Zeus for father and a goddess for mother. With this change from the traditional lineage the poet distinguished his hero from the race of the Titans.&quot; For Goethe, the metaphorical comparison of Prometheus to the image of the Son from the New Testament narratives was of central importance, with the figure of Zeus in Goethe&#x27;s reading being metaphorically matched directly to the image of the Father from the New Testament narratives.

====Percy Bysshe Shelley====
Percy Shelley published his four-act lyrical drama titled &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; in 1820. His version was written in response to the version of myth as presented by Aeschylus and is orientated to the high British Idealism and high British Romanticism prevailing in Shelley&#x27;s own time. Shelley, as the author himself discusses, admits the debt of his version of the myth to Aeschylus and the Greek poetic tradition which he assumes is familiar to readers of his own lyrical drama. For example, it is necessary to understand and have knowledge of the reason for Prometheus&#x27; punishment if the reader is to form an understanding of whether the exoneration portrayed by Shelley in his version of the Prometheus myth is justified or unjustified. The quote of Shelley&#x27;s own words describing the extent of his indebtedness to Aeschylus has been published in numerous sources publicly available.

The literary critic Harold Bloom in his book &quot;Shelley&#x27;s Mythmaking&quot; expresses his high expectation of Shelley in the tradition of mythopoeic poetry. For Bloom, Percy Shelley&#x27;s relationship to the tradition of mythology in poetry &quot;culminates in &#x27;Prometheus&#x27;. The poem provides a complete statement of Shelley&#x27;s vision.&quot; Bloom devotes two full chapters in this 1959 book to Shelley&#x27;s lyrical drama &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;. Following his 1959 book, Bloom edited an anthology of critical opinions on Shelley for Chelsea House Publishers where he concisely stated his opinion as, &quot;Shelley is the unacknowledged ancestor of Wallace Stevens&#x27; conception of poetry as the Supreme Fiction, and &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; is the most capable imagining, outside of Blake and Wordsworth, that the Romantic quest for a Supreme Fiction has achieved.&quot;

Within the pages of his Introduction to the Chelsea House edition on Percy Shelley, Bloom also identifies the six major schools of criticism opposing Shelley&#x27;s idealised mythologising version of the Prometheus myth. In sequence, the opposing schools to Shelley are given as: (i) The school of &quot;common sense&quot;, (ii) The Christian orthodox, (iii) The school of &quot;wit&quot;, (iv) Moralists, of most varieties, (v) The school of &quot;classic&quot; form, and (vi) The Precisionists, or concretists. Although Bloom is least interested in the first two schools, the second one on the Christian orthodox has special bearing on the reception of the Prometheus myth during late Roman antiquity and the synthesis of the New Testament canon. The Greek origins of the Prometheus myth have already discussed the &quot;Titanomachia&quot; as placing the cosmic struggle of Olympus at some point in time preceding the creation of humanity, while in the New Testament synthesis there was a strong assimilation of the prophetic tradition of the Hebrew prophets and their strongly eschatological orientation. This contrast placed a strong emphasis within the ancient Greek consciousness as to the moral and ontological acceptance of the mythology of the &quot;Titanomachia&quot; as an accomplished mythological history, whereas for the synthesis of the New Testament narratives this placed religious consciousness within the community at the level of an anticipated &quot;eschaton&quot; not yet accomplished. Neither of these would guide Percy Shelley in his poetic retelling and re-integration of the Prometheus myth.

To the Socratic Greeks, one important aspect of the discussion of religion would correspond to the philosophical discussion of &#x27;becoming&#x27; with respect to the New Testament syncretism rather than the ontological discussion of &#x27;being&#x27; which was more prominent in the ancient Greek experience of mythologically oriented cult and religion. For Shelley, both of these reading were to be substantially discounted in preference to his own concerns for promoting his own version of an idealised consciousness of a society guided by the precepts of High British Romanticism and High British Idealism.

====&quot;Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus&quot;====
&quot;Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus&quot;, written by Mary Shelley when she was 18, was published in 1818, two years before Percy Shelley&#x27;s above-mentioned play. It has endured as one of the most frequently revisited literary themes in twentieth century film and popular reception with few rivals for its sheer popularity among even established literary works of art. The primary theme is a parallel to the aspect of the Prometheus myth which concentrates on the creation of man by the Titans, transferred and made contemporary by Shelley for British audiences of her time. The subject is that of the creation of life by a scientist, thus bestowing life through the application and technology of medical science rather than by the natural acts of reproduction. The short novel has been adapted into many films and productions ranging from the early versions with Boris Karloff to later versions including Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s 1994 film adaptation.

====Twentieth century====

Franz Kafka wrote a short piece titled &quot;Prometheus&quot;, outlining what he saw as his perspective on four aspects of this myth:
According to the first, he was clamped to a rock in the Caucasus for betraying the secrets of the gods to men, and the gods sent eagles to feed on his liver, which was perpetually renewed.

According to the second, Prometheus, goaded by the pain of the tearing beaks, pressed himself deeper and deeper into the rock until he became one with it.

According to the third, his treachery was forgotten in the course of thousands of years, forgotten by the gods, the eagles, forgotten by himself.

According to the fourth, everyone grew weary of the meaningless affair. The gods grew weary, the eagles grew weary, the wound closed wearily.

There remains the inexplicable mass of rock. The legend tried to explain the inexplicable. As it came out of a substratum of truth it had in turn to end in the inexplicable.

This short piece by Kafka concerning his interest in Prometheus was supplemented by two other mythological pieces written by him. As stated by Reiner Stach, &quot;Kafka&#x27;s world was mythical in nature, with Old Testament and Jewish legends providing the templates. It was only logical (even if Kafka did not state it openly) that he would try his hand at the canon of antiquity, re-interpreting it and incorporating it into his own imagination in the form of allusions, as in &#x27;The Silence of the Sirens,&#x27; &#x27;Prometheus,&#x27; and &#x27;Poseidon.&#x27;&quot; Among 20th century poets, Ted Hughes wrote a 1973 collection of poems titled &quot;Prometheus on His Crag&quot;. The Nepali poet Laxmi Prasad Devkota (d. 1949) also wrote an epic titled &quot;Prometheus&quot; (प्रमीथस).

In his 1952 book, &quot;Lucifer and Prometheus&quot;, Zvi Werblowsky presented the speculatively derived Jungian construction of the character of Satan in Milton&#x27;s celebrated poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Werblowsky applied his own Jungian style of interpretation to appropriate parts of the Prometheus myth for the purpose of interpreting Milton. A reprint of his book in the 1990s by Routledge Press included an introduction to the book by Carl Jung. Some Gnostics have been associated with identifying the theft of fire from heaven as embodied by the fall of Lucifer &quot;the Light Bearer&quot;.

Ayn Rand cited the Prometheus myth in &quot;Anthem&quot;, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, using the mythological character as a metaphor for creative people rebelling against the confines of modern society in The Fountainhead and for the punishment given to &quot;Men of Production&quot; for their productivity and ability in Atlas Shrugged.

The Eulenspiegel Society began the magazine &quot;Prometheus&quot; in the early 1970s; it is a decades-long-running magazine exploring issues important to kinksters, ranging from art and erotica, to advice columns and personal ads, to conversation about the philosophy of consensual kink. The magazine now exists online.

The artificial chemical element promethium is named after Prometheus.

Saturn&#x27;s moon Prometheus is named after him.

&quot;American Prometheus&quot; is a book released in 2005 about Robert J. Oppenheimer, the &quot;father of the atomic bomb&quot;.

===Post-Renaissance aesthetic tradition===
====Visual arts====
Prometheus has been depicted in a number of well-known artworks, including Mexican muralist José Clemente Orozco&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus&quot; fresco at Pomona College and Paul Manship&#x27;s bronze sculpture &quot;Prometheus&quot; at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan.

====Classical music, opera, and ballet====
Works of classical music opera, and ballet directly or indirectly inspired by the myth of Prometheus have included renderings by some of the major composers of both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In this tradition, the orchestral representation of the myth has received the most sustained attention of composers. These have included the symphonic poem by Franz Liszt titled &quot;Prometheus&quot; from 1850, among his other Symphonic Poems (No. 5, S.99). Alexander Scriabin composed &quot;&quot;, Opus 60 (1910), also for orchestra. In the same year Gabriel Fauré composed his three-act opera &quot;Prométhée&quot; (1910). Charles-Valentin Alkan composed his &quot;Grande sonate &#x27;Les quatre âges&#x27;&quot; (1847), with the 4th movement entitled &quot;Prométhée enchaîné&quot; (Prometheus Bound). Beethoven composed the score to a ballet version of the myth titled &quot;The Creatures of Prometheus&quot; (1801).

An adaptation of Goethe&#x27;s poetic version of the myth was composed by Hugo Wolf, &quot;Prometheus&quot; (&quot;Bedecke deinen Himmel, Zeus&quot;, 1889), as part of his Goethe-lieder for voice and piano, later transcribed for orchestra and voice. An opera of the myth was composed by Carl Orff titled &quot;Prometheus&quot; (1968), using Aeschylus&#x27; Greek language &quot;Prometheia&quot;. A tradition has of course grown among critics of finding allusions to &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring cycle&quot;.

Rudolf Wagner-Régeny composed the Prometheus (opera) in 1959. Another work inspired by the myth, &quot;Prometeo&quot; (Prometheus), was composed by Luigi Nono between 1981 and 1984 and can be considered a sequence of nine cantatas. The libretto in Italian was written by Massimo Cacciari, and selects from texts by such varied authors as Aeschylus, Walter Benjamin and Rainer Maria Rilke and presents the different versions of the myth of Prometheus without telling any version literally.

<text>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that results in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight.
Phenylketonuria is an inherited genetic disorder. It is caused by mutations in the &quot;PAH&quot; gene, which can result in inefficient or nonfunctional phenylalanine hydroxylase, an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of excess phenylalanine. This results in the buildup of dietary phenylalanine to potentially toxic levels. It is autosomal recessive, meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated for the condition to develop. There are two main types, classic PKU and variant PKU, depending on whether any enzyme function remains. Those with one copy of a mutated gene typically do not have symptoms. Many countries have newborn screening programs for the disease.
Treatment is with a diet that (1) is low in foods that contain phenylalanine, and (2) includes special supplements. Babies should use a special formula with a small amount of breast milk. The diet should begin as soon as possible after birth and be continued for life. People who are diagnosed early and maintain a strict diet can have normal health and a normal life span. Effectiveness is monitored through periodic blood tests. The medication sapropterin dihydrochloride may be useful in some.
Phenylketonuria affects about 1 in 12,000 babies. Males and females are affected equally. The disease was discovered in 1934 by Ivar Asbjørn Følling, with the importance of diet determined in 1935. As of 2023, genetic therapies that aim to directly restore liver PAH activity are a promising and active research field.

==Signs and symptoms==

Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight.

Because the mother&#x27;s body is able to break down phenylalanine during pregnancy, infants with PKU are normal at birth. The disease is not detectable by physical examination at that time, because no damage has yet been done. Newborn screening is performed to detect the disease and initiate treatment before any damage is done. The blood sample is usually taken by a heel prick, typically performed 2–7 days after birth. This test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after one or two days of normal infant feeding.

If a child is not diagnosed during the routine newborn screening test and a phenylalanine-restricted diet is not introduced, then phenylalanine levels in the blood will increase over time. Toxic levels of phenylalanine, along with insufficient levels of tyrosine, can interfere with infant development in ways that have permanent effects. The disease may present clinically with seizures, hypopigmentation (excessively fair hair and skin), and a &quot;musty odor&quot; to the baby&#x27;s sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate, a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylacetone). In most cases, a repeat test should be done at approximately two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any phenylketonuria that was initially missed.

Untreated children often fail to attain early developmental milestones, develop microcephaly, and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities, seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A characteristic &quot;musty or mousy&quot; odor on the skin, as well as a predisposition for eczema, persists throughout life in the absence of treatment.

The damage done to the brain if PKU is untreated during the first months of life is not reversible. Affected children who are detected at birth and treated are much less likely to develop neurological problems or have seizures and intellectual disability, though such clinical disorders are still possible including asthma, eczema, anemia, weight gain, renal insufficiency, osteoporosis, gastritis, esophagus, and kidney deficiencies, kidney stones, and hypertension. Additionally, mood disorders occur 230% higher than controls; dizziness and giddiness occur 180% higher; chronic ischemic heart disease, asthma, diabetes, and gastroenteritis occur 170% higher; and stress and adjustment disorder occur 160% higher. In general, however, outcomes for people treated for PKU are good. Treated people may have no detectable physical, neurological, or developmental problems at all.

==Genetics==
PKU is an autosomal recessive metabolic genetic disorder. As an autosomal recessive disorder, two PKU alleles are required for an individual to experience symptoms of the disease. For a child to inherit PKU, both parents must have and pass on the defective gene. If both parents are carriers for PKU, there is a 25% chance any child they have will be born with the disorder, a 50% chance the child will be a carrier and a 25% chance the child will neither develop nor be a carrier for the disease.

PKU is characterized by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the gene for the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), rendering it nonfunctional. This enzyme is necessary to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) to the amino acid tyrosine (Tyr). When PAH activity is reduced, phenylalanine accumulates and is converted into phenylpyruvate (also known as phenylketone), which can be detected in the urine.

Carriers of a single PKU allele do not exhibit symptoms of the disease but appear to be protected to some extent against the fungal toxin ochratoxin A. Louis Woolf suggested that this accounted for the persistence of the allele in certain populations, in that it confers a selective advantage—in other words, being a heterozygote is advantageous.

The PAH gene is located on chromosome 12 in the bands 12q22-q24.2. As of 2000, around 400 disease-causing mutations had been found in the PAH gene. This is an example of allelic genetic heterogeneity.

==Pathophysiology==
When phenylalanine (Phe) cannot be metabolized by the body, a typical diet that would be healthy for people without PKU causes abnormally high levels of Phe to accumulate in the blood, which is toxic to the brain. If left untreated (and often even in treatment), complications of PKU include severe intellectual disability, brain function abnormalities, microcephaly, mood disorders, irregular motor functioning, and behavioral problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as physical symptoms such as a &quot;musty&quot; odor, eczema, and unusually light skin and hair coloration.

===Classical PKU===
Classical PKU, and its less severe forms &quot;mild PKU&quot; and &quot;mild hyperphenylalaninemia&quot; are caused by a mutated gene for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which converts the amino acid phenylalanine (&quot;Phe&quot;) to other essential compounds in the body, in particular tyrosine. Tyrosine is a conditionally essential amino acid for PKU patients because without PAH it cannot be produced in the body through the breakdown of phenylalanine.

PAH deficiency causes a spectrum of disorders, including classic phenylketonuria (PKU) and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (also known as &quot;hyperphe&quot; or &quot;mild HPA&quot;), a less severe accumulation of phenylalanine. Compared to classic PKU patients, patients with &quot;hyperphe&quot; have greater PAH enzyme activity and are able to tolerate larger amounts of phenylalanine in their diets. Without dietary intervention, mild HPA patients have blood Phe levels higher than those with normal PAH activity. There is currently no international consensus on the definition of mild HPA, however, it is most frequently diagnosed at blood Phe levels between 2–6 mg/dL.

Phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid (LNAA). LNAAs compete for transport across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LNAAT). If phenylalanine is in excess in the blood, it will saturate the transporter. Excessive phenylalanine levels tend to decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain. As these amino acids are necessary for protein and neurotransmitter synthesis, Phe buildup hinders the development of the brain, causing intellectual disability.

Recent research suggests that neurocognitive, psychosocial, quality of life, growth, nutrition, and bone pathology are slightly suboptimal even for patients who are treated and maintain their Phe levels in the target range if their diet is not supplemented with other amino acids.

Classic PKU affects myelination and white matter tracts in untreated infants; this may be one major cause of neurological problems associated with phenylketonuria. Differences in white matter development are observable with magnetic resonance imaging. Abnormalities in the gray matter can also be detected, particularly in the motor and pre-motor cortex, thalamus and the hippocampus.

It was recently suggested that PKU may resemble amyloid diseases, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease, due to the formation of toxic amyloid-like assemblies of phenylalanine.

===Tetrahydrobiopterin-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia===
A rarer form of hyperphenylalaninemia is tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency, which occurs when the PAH enzyme is normal, and a defect is found in the biosynthesis or recycling of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). BH4 is necessary for proper activity of the enzyme PAH, and this coenzyme can be supplemented as treatment. Those with this form of hyperphenylalaninemia may have a deficiency of tyrosine (which is created from phenylalanine by PAH), in which case treatment is supplementation of tyrosine to account for this deficiency.

Levels of dopamine can be used to distinguish between these two types. Tetrahydrobiopterin is required to convert Phe to Tyr and is required to convert Tyr to L-DOPA via the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. L-DOPA, in turn, is converted to dopamine. Low levels of dopamine lead to high levels of prolactin. By contrast, in classical PKU (without dihydrobiopterin involvement), prolactin levels would be relatively normal.

As of 2020, tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency was known to result from defects in five genes.

===Metabolic pathways===

The enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase normally converts the amino acid phenylalanine into the amino acid tyrosine. If this reaction does not occur, phenylalanine accumulates and tyrosine is deficient. Excessive phenylalanine can be metabolized into phenylketones through the minor route, a transaminase pathway with glutamate. Metabolites include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine. Elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood and detection of phenylketones in the urine is diagnostic, however, most patients are diagnosed via newborn screening.

==Screening==

PKU is commonly included in the newborn screening panel of many countries, with varied detection techniques. Most babies born in Europe, North America, and Australia are screened for PKU soon after birth. Screening for PKU is done with bacterial inhibition assay (Guthrie test), immunoassays using fluorometric or photometric detection, or amino acid measurement using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Measurements done using MS/MS determine the concentration of Phe and the ratio of Phe to tyrosine, the ratio will be elevated in PKU.

==Treatment==
PKU is not curable. However, if it is diagnosed early enough, an affected newborn can grow up with normal brain development by managing and controlling phenylalanine (&quot;Phe&quot;) levels through diet, or a combination of diet and medication. If dietary treatment is not initiated within 2 weeks after birth, the child is likely to develop permanent intellectual disability, even if dietary interventions begin shortly thereafter.

===Diet===
People who follow the prescribed dietary treatment from birth may (but not always) have no symptoms. Their PKU would be detectable only by a blood test. People must adhere to a diet low in Phe for optimal brain development. Since Phe is necessary to synthesize many proteins, it is required for appropriate growth, but levels must be strictly controlled.
Optimal health ranges (or &quot;target ranges&quot;) are between 120 and 360 μmol/L or equivalently 2 to 6 mg/dL. This is optimally achieved during at least the first 10 years, to allow the brain to develop normally.

The diet requires restricting or eliminating foods high in Phe, such as soybeans, egg whites, shrimp, chicken breast, spirulina, watercress, fish, nuts, crayfish, lobster, tuna, turkey, legumes, and low-fat cottage cheese. Starchy foods, such as potatoes and corn are generally acceptable in controlled amounts, but the quantity of Phe consumed from these foods must be monitored. A corn-free diet may be prescribed in some cases. A food diary is usually kept to record the amount of Phe consumed with each meal, snack, or drink. An &quot;exchange&quot; system can be used to calculate the amount of Phe in a portion of food from the protein content identified on a nutritional information label. Lower-protein &quot;medical food&quot; substitutes are often used in place of normal bread, pasta, and other grain-based foods, which contain a significant amount of Phe. Many fruits and vegetables are lower in Phe and can be eaten in larger quantities. Infants may still be breastfed to provide all of the benefits of breastmilk, but the quantity must also be monitored and supplementation for missing nutrients will be required. The sweetener aspartame, present in many diet foods and soft drinks, must also be avoided, as aspartame contains phenylalanine.

The amino acid tyrosine becomes essential in people with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. Thus, in addition to the careful &quot;reduction&quot; of Phe in the diet, Tyr must be &quot;supplemented&quot; to ensure that nutritional needs are met.

Different people can tolerate different amounts of Phe in their diet. Regular blood tests are used to determine the effects of dietary Phe intake on blood Phe level.

===Nutritional supplements===
Supplementary &quot;protein substitute&quot; formulas are typically prescribed for people with PKU (starting in infancy) to provide the amino acids and other necessary nutrients that would otherwise be lacking in a low-phenylalanine diet. Tyrosine, which is normally derived from phenylalanine and which is necessary for normal brain function, is usually supplemented. Consumption of the protein substitute formulas can actually reduce phenylalanine levels, probably because it stops the process of protein catabolism from releasing Phe stored in the muscles and other tissues into the blood. Many PKU patients have their highest Phe levels after a period of fasting (such as overnight) because fasting triggers catabolism. A diet that is low in phenylalanine but does not include protein substitutes may also fail to lower blood Phe levels, since a nutritionally insufficient diet may also trigger catabolism. For all these reasons, the prescription formula is an important part of the treatment for patients with classic PKU.

Evidence supports dietary supplementation with large neutral amino acids (LNAAs). The LNAAs (e.g. leu, tyr, trp, met, his, ile, val, thr) may compete with phe for specific carrier proteins that transport LNAAs across the intestinal mucosa into the blood and across the blood–brain barrier into the brain. Its use is limited in the US due to the cost but is available in most countries as part of a low protein / PHE diet to replace missing nutrients.

Another treatment strategy is casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP), which is a milk peptide naturally free of Phe in its pure form CGMP can substitute for the main part of the free amino acids in the PKU diet and provides several beneficial nutritional effects compared to free amino acids. The fact that CGMP is a peptide ensures that the absorption rate of its amino acids is prolonged compared to free amino acids and thereby results in improved protein retention and increased satiety compared to free amino acids. Another important benefit of CGMP is that the taste is significantly improved when CGMP substitutes part of the free amino acids and this may help ensure improved compliance to the PKU diet.

Furthermore, CGMP contains a high amount of the Phe-lowering LNAAs, which constitutes about 41 g per 100 g protein and will therefore help maintain plasma Phe levels in the target range.

===Enzyme substitutes===
In 2018, the FDA approved an enzyme substitute called pegvaliase which metabolizes phenylalanine. It is for adults who are poorly managed on other treatments.

Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (a cofactor for the oxidation of phenylalanine) when taken by mouth can reduce blood levels of this amino acid in some people.

===Mothers===
For women with PKU, it is important for the health of their children to maintain low Phe levels before and during pregnancy. Though the developing fetus may only be a carrier of the PKU gene, the intrauterine environment can have very high levels of phenylalanine, which can cross the placenta. The child may develop congenital heart disease, growth retardation, microcephaly, and intellectual disability as a result. PKU-affected women themselves are not at risk of additional complications during pregnancy.

In most countries, women with PKU who wish to have children are advised to lower their blood Phe levels (typically to between 2 and 6 mg/dL) before they become pregnant, and carefully control their levels throughout the pregnancy. This is achieved by performing regular blood tests and adhering very strictly to a diet, in general, monitored on a day-to-day basis by a specialist metabolic dietitian. In many cases, as the fetus&#x27; liver begins to develop and produce PAH normally, the mother&#x27;s blood Phe levels will drop, requiring an increased intake to remain within the safe range of 2–6 mg/dL. The mother&#x27;s daily Phe intake may double or even triple by the end of the pregnancy, as a result. When maternal blood Phe levels fall below 2 mg/dL, anecdotal reports indicate that the mothers may experience adverse effects, including headaches, nausea, hair loss, and general malaise. When low phenylalanine levels are maintained for the duration of pregnancy, there are no elevated levels of risk of birth defects compared with a baby born to a non-PKU mother.

==Epidemiology==
The average number of new cases of PKU varies in different human populations. United States Caucasians are affected at a rate of 1 in 10,000. Turkey has the highest documented rate in the world, with 1 in 2,600 births, while countries such as Finland and Japan have extremely low rates with fewer than one case of PKU in 100,000 births. A 1987 study from Slovakia reports a Roma population with an extremely high incidence of PKU (one case in 40 births) due to extensive inbreeding. It is the most common amino acid metabolic problem in the United Kingdom.

Before the causes of PKU were understood, PKU caused severe disability in most people who inherited the relevant mutations. Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Pearl S. Buck had a daughter named Carol who lived with PKU before treatment was available, and wrote an account of its effects in a book called &quot;The Child Who Never Grew.&quot; Many untreated PKU patients born before widespread newborn screening are still alive, largely in dependent living homes/institutions.

Phenylketonuria was discovered by the Norwegian physician Ivar Asbjørn Følling in 1934 when he noticed hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) was associated with intellectual disability. In Norway, this disorder is known as Følling&#x27;s disease, named after its discoverer. Følling was one of the first physicians to apply detailed chemical analysis to the study of disease.

In 1934 at Rikshospitalet, Følling saw a young woman named Borgny Egeland. She had two children, Liv and Dag, who had been normal at birth but subsequently developed intellectual disability. When Dag was about a year old, the mother noticed a strong smell in his urine. Følling obtained urine samples from the children and, after many tests, he found that the substance causing the odor in the urine was phenylpyruvic acid. The children, he concluded, had excess phenylpyruvic acid in the urine, the condition which came to be called phenylketonuria (PKU).

His analysis of the urine of the two affected siblings led him to request many physicians near Oslo to test the urine of other affected patients. This led to the discovery of the same substance he had found in eight other patients. He conducted tests and found reactions that gave rise to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid, which led him to conclude that the compound contained a benzene ring. Further testing showed the melting point to be the same as phenylpyruvic acid, which indicated that the substance was in the urine.

In 1954, Horst Bickel, Evelyn Hickmans and John Gerrard published a paper that described how they created a diet that was low in phenylalanine and the patient recovered. Bickel, Gerrard, and Hickmans were awarded the John Scott Medal in 1962 for their discovery.

PKU was the first disorder to be routinely diagnosed through widespread newborn screening. Robert Guthrie introduced the newborn screening test for PKU in the early 1960s. With the knowledge that PKU could be detected before symptoms were evident, and treatment initiated, screening was quickly adopted around the world. Ireland was the first country to introduce a national screening programme in February 1966, Austria also started screening in 1966 and England in 1968.

In 2017, the European Guidelines were published. They were called for by the patient organizations such as the European Society for Phenylketonuria and Allied Disorders Treated as Phenylketonuria. They have received some critical reception.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;phenylketonuria&quot; uses combining forms of &quot;phenyl&quot; + &quot;ketone&quot; + &quot;&quot;; it is pronounced .

==Research==
Other therapies are under investigation, including gene therapy.

BioMarin is conducting clinical trials to investigate PEG-PAL (PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase or &#x27;PAL&#x27;), which is an enzyme substitution therapy in which the missing PAH enzyme is replaced with an analogous enzyme that also breaks down Phe. PEG-PAL was in Phase 2 clinical development as of 2015, but was put on clinical hold in September 2021. In February 2022, the FDA issued a statement requiring further data from non-clinical studies to assess oncogenic risk resulting from PEG-PAL treatments.

<doc id="23253" wikidata="Q165074" url="?curid=23253" title="Parallax">
<text>Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight and is measured by the angle or half-angle of inclination between those two lines. Due to foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther objects, so parallax can be used to determine distances.

To measure large distances, such as the distance of a planet or a star from Earth, astronomers use the principle of parallax. Here, the term &quot;parallax&quot; is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to the star, as observed when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit. These distances form the lowest rung of what is called &quot;the cosmic distance ladder&quot;, the first in a succession of methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects, serving as a basis for other distance measurements in astronomy forming the higher rungs of the ladder.

Because parallax is weak if the triangle formed with an object under observation and two observation points has an angle much greater 90°, the use of parallax for distance measurements is usually restricted to objects that are directly &quot;faced&quot; by the baseline (the line between two observation points) of the formed triangles.

Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex cameras that view objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, along with humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis. In computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, and there is a device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find the range, and in some variations also altitude to a target.

A simple everyday example of parallax can be seen in the dashboards of motor vehicles that use a needle-style mechanical speedometer. When viewed from directly in front, the speed may show exactly 60, but when viewed from the passenger seat, the needle may appear to show a slightly different speed due to the angle of viewing combined with the displacement of the needle from the plane of the numerical dial.

== Visual perception ==
Because the eyes of humans and other animals are in different positions on the head, they present different views simultaneously. This is the basis of stereopsis, the process by which the brain exploits the parallax due to the different views from the eye to gain depth perception and estimate distances to objects.

Animals also use motion parallax, in which the animals (or just the head) move to gain different viewpoints. For example, pigeons (whose eyes do not have overlapping fields of view and thus cannot use stereopsis) bob their heads up and down to see depth.
The motion parallax is exploited also in wiggle stereoscopy, computer graphics that provide depth cues through viewpoint-shifting animation rather than through binocular vision.

== Distance measurement ==
Parallax arises due to a change in viewpoint occurring due to the motion of the observer, of the observed, or both. What is essential is relative motion. By observing parallax, measuring angles, and using geometry, one can determine distance.

Distance measurement by parallax is a special case of the principle of triangulation, which states that, if one side length and two angles of a triangle are known, then the rest side lengths and the angle can be solved (i.e., the information of the triangle is fully determined). Thus, the careful measurement of the length of one baseline and two angles at the baseline edges can fix the scale of an entire triangulation network.

In astronomy, the triangle is extremely long and narrow, and by measuring both its shortest side length (the motion of the observer) and the small top angle (always less than 1 arcsecond, leaving the other two close to 90 degrees), the length of the long sides (in practice considered to be equal) can be determined. The distance &quot;d&quot; from the Sun to a star (measured in parsecs) is the reciprocal of the parallax &quot;p&quot; (measured in arcseconds): formula_1 For example, the distance from the Sun to Proxima Centauri is 1/0.7687 = , and a celestial object which distance is twice than this star has the half parallax 0.65045

On Earth, a coincidence rangefinder or parallax rangefinder can be used to find distance to a target. In surveying, the problem of resection explores angular measurements from a known baseline for determining an unknown point&#x27;s coordinates.

== Astronomy ==


== Metrology ==
Measurements made by viewing the position of some markers relative to something to be measured are subject to an error caused by parallax, if the markers are some distance away from the object under measurement and not viewed from the correct position or angle. An example is reading the position of a pointer against a scale in an instrument such as an analog multimeter as shown in the right figure. The same effect alters the speed read on a car&#x27;s speedometer by a driver in front of it and a passenger off to the side, values read from a graticule, not in actual contact with the display on an oscilloscope, etc.

To help the user avoid this problem, the scale is sometimes printed above a narrow strip of mirror, and the user&#x27;s eye is positioned so that the pointer obscures its reflection, guaranteeing that the user&#x27;s line of sight is perpendicular to the mirror and therefore to the scale.

== Photogrammetry ==
When viewed through a stereo viewer, aerial picture pair offers a pronounced stereo effect of landscape and buildings. High buildings appear to &quot;keel over&quot; in the direction away from the center of the photograph. Measurements of this parallax are used to deduce the height of the buildings, provided that flying height and baseline distances are known. This is a key component of the process of photogrammetry.

== Photography ==
Parallax error can be seen when taking photos with many types of cameras, such as twin-lens reflex cameras and those including viewfinders (such as rangefinder cameras). In such cameras, the eye sees the subject through different optics (the viewfinder, or a second lens) than the one through which the photo is taken. As the viewfinder is often found above the lens of the camera, photos with parallax error are often slightly lower than intended, the classic example being the image of a person with their head cropped off. This problem is addressed in single-lens reflex cameras, in which the viewfinder sees through the same lens through which the photo is taken (with the aid of a movable mirror), thus avoiding parallax error.

Parallax is also an issue in image stitching, such as for panoramas.

==Weapon sights==
Parallax affects sighting devices of ranged weapons in many ways. On sights fitted on small arms and bows, etc., the perpendicular distance between the sight and the weapon&#x27;s launch axis (e.g. the bore axis of a gun)—generally referred to as &quot;sight height&quot;—can induce significant aiming errors when shooting at close range, particularly when shooting at small targets. This parallax error is compensated for (when needed) via calculations that also take in other variables such as bullet drop, windage, and the distance at which the target is expected to be. Sight height can be used to advantage when &quot;sighting in&quot; rifles for field use. A typical hunting rifle (.222 with telescopic sights) sighted in at 75m will still be useful from without needing further adjustment.

===Optical sights===

In some reticled optical instruments such as telescopes, microscopes or in telescopic sights (&quot;scopes&quot;) used on small arms and theodolites, parallax can create problems when the reticle is not coincident with the focal plane of the target image. This is because when the reticle and the target are not at the same focus, the optically corresponded distances being projected through the eyepiece are also different, and the user&#x27;s eye will register the difference in parallaxes between the reticle and the target (whenever eye position changes) as a relative displacement on top of each other. The term &quot;parallax shift&quot; refers to the resultant apparent &quot;floating&quot; movements of the reticle over the target image when the user moves his/her head/eye laterally (up/down or left/right) behind the sight, i.e. an error where the reticle does not stay aligned with the user&#x27;s optical axis.

Some firearm scopes are equipped with a parallax compensation mechanism, which consists of a movable optical element that enables the optical system to shift the focus of the target image at varying distances into the same optical plane of the reticle (or vice versa). Many low-tier telescopic sights may have no parallax compensation because in practice they can still perform very acceptably without eliminating parallax shift. In this case, the scope is often set fixed at a designated parallax-free distance that best suits their intended usage. Typical standard factory parallax-free distances for hunting scopes are 100 yd (or 90 m) to make them suited for hunting shots that rarely exceed 300 yd/m. Some competition and military-style scopes without parallax compensation may be adjusted to be parallax free at ranges up to 300 yd/m to make them better suited for aiming at longer ranges. Scopes for guns with shorter practical ranges, such as airguns, rimfire rifles, shotguns, and muzzleloaders, will have parallax settings for shorter distances, commonly for rimfire scopes and for shotguns and muzzleloaders. Airgun scopes are very often found with adjustable parallax, usually in the form of an adjustable objective (or &quot;AO&quot; for short) design, and may adjust down to as near as .

Non-magnifying reflector or &quot;reflex&quot; sights can be theoretically &quot;parallax free&quot;. But since these sights use parallel collimated light this is only true when the target is at infinity. At finite distances, eye movement perpendicular to the device will cause parallax movement in the reticle image in exact relationship to the eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics. Firearm sights, such as some red dot sights, try to correct for this via not focusing the reticle at infinity, but instead at some finite distance, a designed target range where the reticle will show very little movement due to parallax. Some manufacturers market reflector sight models they call &quot;parallax free&quot;, but this refers to an optical system that compensates for off axis spherical aberration, an optical error induced by the spherical mirror used in the sight that can cause the reticle position to diverge off the sight&#x27;s optical axis with change in eye position.

== Artillery-fire ==
Because of the positioning of field or naval artillery, each gun has a slightly different perspective of the target relative to the location of the fire-control system. When aiming guns at the target, the fire control system must compensate for parallax to assure that fire from each gun converges on the target.

== Art ==

Several of Mark Renn&#x27;s sculptural works play with parallax, appearing abstract until viewed from a specific angle. One such sculpture is &quot;The Darwin Gate&quot; (pictured) in Shrewsbury, England, which from a certain angle appears to form a dome, according to Historic England, in &quot;the form of a Saxon helmet with a Norman window... inspired by features of St Mary&#x27;s Church which was attended by Charles Darwin as a boy&quot;.

== As a metaphor ==
In a philosophic/geometric sense: an apparent change in the direction of an object, caused by a change in observational position that provides a new line of sight. The apparent displacement, or difference of position, of an object, as seen from two different stations, or points of view. In contemporary writing, parallax can also be the same story, or a similar story from approximately the same timeline, from one book, told from a different perspective in another book. The word and concept feature prominently in James Joyce&#x27;s 1922 novel, &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Orson Scott Card also used the term when referring to Ender&#x27;s Shadow as compared to Ender&#x27;s Game.

The metaphor is invoked by Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek in his 2006 book &quot;The Parallax View&quot;, borrowing the concept of &quot;parallax view&quot; from the Japanese philosopher and literary critic Kojin Karatani. Žižek notes

<doc id="23254" wikidata="Q107231" url="?curid=23254" title="Paralysis">
<text>Paralysis (: paralyses; also known as plegia) is a loss of motor function in one or more muscles. Paralysis can also be accompanied by a loss of feeling (sensory loss) in the affected area if there is sensory damage. In the United States, roughly 1 in 50 people have been diagnosed with some form of permanent or transient paralysis. The word &quot;paralysis&quot; derives from the Greek παράλυσις, meaning &quot;disabling of the nerves&quot; from παρά (&quot;para&quot;) meaning &quot;beside, by&quot; and λύσις (&quot;lysis&quot;) meaning &quot;making loose&quot;. A paralysis accompanied by involuntary tremors is usually called &quot;palsy&quot;.

==Causes==
Paralysis is most often caused by damage in the nervous system, especially the spinal cord. Other major causes are stroke, trauma with nerve injury, poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, ALS, botulism, spina bifida, multiple sclerosis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome. Temporary paralysis occurs during REM sleep, and dysregulation of this system can lead to episodes of waking paralysis. Drugs that interfere with nerve function, such as curare, can also cause paralysis.

&quot;Pseudoparalysis&quot; (&quot;pseudo-&quot; meaning &quot;false, not genuine&quot;, from Greek ψεῦδος) is voluntary restriction or inhibition of motion because of pain, incoordination, orgasm, or other cause, and is not due to actual muscular paralysis. In an infant, it may be a symptom of congenital syphilis. Pseudoparalysis can be caused by extreme mental stress and is a common feature of mental disorders such as panic anxiety disorder.

==Variations==
Paralysis can occur in localized or generalized forms, or it may follow a certain pattern. Most paralyses caused by nervous-system damage (e.g., spinal cord injuries) are constant in nature; however, some forms of periodic paralysis, including sleep paralysis, are caused by other factors.
Paralysis can occur in newborns due to a congenital defect known as spina bifida. Spina bifida causes one or more of the vertebrae to fail to form vertebral arches within the infant, which allows the spinal cord to protrude from the rest of the spine. In extreme cases, this can cause spinal cord function inferior to the missing vertebral arches to cease. This cessation of spinal cord function can result in paralysis of lower extremities. Documented cases of paralysis of the anal sphincter in newborns have been observed when spina bifida has gone untreated. While life-threatening, many cases of spina bifida can be corrected surgically if operated on within 72 hours of birth.

Ascending paralysis presents in the lower limbs before the upper limbs. It can be associated with:
* Guillain–Barré syndrome (another name for this condition is &quot;Landry&#x27;s ascending paralysis&quot;)
* Tick paralysis

Ascending paralysis contrasts with descending paralysis, which occurs in conditions such as botulism.

==Other animals==
Many animal species use paralyzing toxins to capture prey, evade predation, or both. In stimulated muscles, the decrease in frequency of the miniature potentials runs parallel to the decrease in postsynaptic potential, and to the decrease in muscle contraction. In invertebrates, this clearly indicates that, e.g., &quot;Microbracon&quot; (wasp genus) venom causes paralysis of the neuromuscular system by acting at a presynaptic site. &quot;Philanthus&quot; venom inhibits both the fast and slow neuromuscular system at identical concentrations. It causes a decrease in the frequency of the miniature potentials without affecting their amplitude significantly.

===Invertebrates===
In some species of wasp, to complete the reproductive cycle, the female wasp paralyzes a prey item such as a grasshopper and places it in her nest. In the species &quot;Philanthus gibbosus&quot;, the paralyzed insect (most often a bee species) is coated in a thick layer of pollen. The adult &quot;P. gibbosus&quot; then lays eggs in the paralyzed insect, which is devoured by the larvae when they hatch.

===Vertebrates===
A renowned example of a vertebrate-produced paralyzing toxin is the tetrodotoxin of fish species such as &quot;Takifugu rubripes&quot;, the famously lethal pufferfish of Japanese fugu, which works by binding to sodium channels in nerve cells, inhibiting the cells&#x27; proper function. A nonlethal dose of this toxin results in temporary paralysis. This toxin is also present in many other species ranging from toads to nemerteans.

Paralysis can be seen in breeds of dogs that are chondrodysplastic. These dogs have short legs, and may also have short muzzles. Their intervertebral disc material can calcify and become more brittle. In such cases, the disc may rupture, with disc material ending up in the spinal canal, or rupturing more laterally to press on spinal nerves. A minor rupture may only result in paresis, but a major rupture can cause enough damage to cut off circulation. If no signs of pain can be elicited, surgery should be performed within 24 hours of the incident, to remove the disc material and relieve pressure on the spinal cord. After 24 hours, the chance of recovery declines rapidly, since with continued pressure, the spinal cord tissue deteriorates and dies.

Another type of paralysis is caused by a fibrocartilaginous embolism. This is a microscopic piece of disc material that breaks off and becomes lodged in a spinal artery. Nerves served by the artery will die when deprived of blood.

The German Shepherd Dog is especially prone to developing degenerative myelopathy. This is a deterioration of nerves in the spinal cord, starting in the posterior part of the cord. Affected dogs will become incontinent and gradually weaker in the hind legs as nerves die off. Eventually, their hind legs become useless. This disease also affects other large breeds of dogs. 

Cats with a heart murmur may develop blood clots that travel through arteries. If a clot is large enough to block one or both femoral arteries, there may be hind leg paralysis because the major source of blood flow to the hind leg is blocked.

Many snakes and trees exhibit powerful neurotoxins that can cause nonpermanent paralysis or death.

<text>Paths of Glory is a 1957 American anti-war film co-written and directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on the 1935 novel of the same name by Humphrey Cobb, which was based on the Souain corporals affair during World War I. The film stars Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, the commanding officer of French soldiers who refuse to continue a suicidal attack, after which Dax defends them against charges of cowardice in a court-martial.

The film was co-produced through Douglas&#x27;s film production company, Bryna Productions, and a joint venture between Stanley Kubrick and James B. Harris, Harris-Kubrick Pictures. In 1992, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

==Plot==
In 1916, during World War I in Northern France, French Major General Georges Broulard orders his subordinate, Brigadier General Paul Mireau, to take the Anthill, a well-defended German position. Mireau refuses, citing the impossibility of success. However, when Broulard mentions a potential promotion, Mireau quickly convinces himself that the attack will succeed.

In the trenches, Mireau throws a private out of the regiment for showing signs of shell shock. Mireau leaves the planning of the attack to Colonel Dax, despite Dax&#x27;s protests that the result will weaken the French Army.

Before the attack, drunken Lieutenant Roget leads a night-time scouting mission, sending one of his two men ahead. Overcome by fear while waiting for the man&#x27;s return, Roget lobs a grenade, accidentally killing the scout. Corporal Paris, the other soldier on the mission, confronts Roget, who denies any wrongdoing and falsifies his report to Colonel Dax.

The next morning, the attack on the Anthill is a failure. Dax leads the first wave of soldiers over the top into no man&#x27;s land under heavy rifle and machine gun fire. None of the men reach the German trenches, and B Company refuses to leave their trench after seeing that defeat. Mireau orders his artillery to open fire on them to force them onto the battlefield. The artillery commander refuses to fire without written confirmation of the order.

To deflect blame for the attack&#x27;s failure, Mireau decides to court-martial 100 of the soldiers for cowardice. Broulard orders Mireau to reduce the number and Mireau arrives at three, one from each company. Corporal Paris is chosen because his commanding officer Roget wishes to keep him from testifying about what happened in the scouting mission. Private Ferol is picked by his commanding officer because he is a &quot;social undesirable&quot;. Private Arnaud is chosen at random.

Dax, a criminal defense lawyer in civilian life, volunteers to defend the men at their court-martial. The trial, however, is a farce. There is no formal written indictment, a court stenographer is not present, and the court refuses to admit evidence that would support acquittal. In his closing statement, Dax angrily denounces the proceedings. Later, in a meeting with Broulard, Dax informs him that Mireau had ordered the artillery to fire onto French trenches to dislodge the soldiers refusing to attack. Nonetheless, the three are sentenced to death and shot by firing squad.

Following the executions, Broulard tells Mireau that he will be investigated for ordering artillery to fire on his own men. Mireau denounces this as a betrayal by his commanding officer. After Mireau leaves, Broulard then offers Mireau&#x27;s command to Dax, assuming that Dax&#x27;s attempts to stop the executions were a ploy to gain Mireau&#x27;s job. Discovering that Dax was sincere, Broulard rebukes him for his idealism, but Dax in turn denounces Broulard&#x27;s nihilism.

After the execution, some of Dax&#x27;s soldiers are carousing at an inn. They become more subdued as they listen to and then join in with a captive German girl working as a barmaid and entertainer as she sings a sad German sentimental folk song, The Faithful Hussar. Dax leaves without informing the men that they have been ordered to return to the front and the continuing carnage of the trenches.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Background===
The title of Cobb&#x27;s novel came from the ninth stanza of Thomas Gray&#x27;s poem &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot; (1751).

&lt;poem&gt;The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow&#x27;r,
And all that beauty, all that wealth e&#x27;er gave,
Awaits alike th&#x27;inevitable hour.
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.&lt;/poem&gt;

The book was a minor success when published in 1935, retelling the true-life affair of four French soldiers who were executed to set an example to the rest of the troops. The novel was adapted to the stage the same year by Sidney Howard, World War I veteran and scriptwriter of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. The play was a flop on Broadway because of its harsh anti-war scenes that alienated the audience. Nonetheless, Howard continued to believe in the relevance of the subject matter and thought it should be made into a film, writing, &quot;It seems to me that our motion picture industry must feel something of a sacred obligation to make the picture.&quot; Fulfilling Howard&#x27;s &quot;sacred obligation&quot;, Stanley Kubrick decided to adapt it to the screen after he remembered reading the book when he was younger. Kubrick and his partners purchased the film rights from Cobb&#x27;s widow for $10,000.

Gray&#x27;s stanza reflects Kubrick&#x27;s feelings about war as well, and that becomes clear in the narrative of the film – a long battle for something with such an unimportant name as the &quot;Ant Hill&quot;. Some of Kubrick&#x27;s unrealized projects contained themes of war as well. Kubrick once told a &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist;
Man isn&#x27;t a noble savage, he&#x27;s an ignoble savage. He is irrational, brutal, weak, silly, unable to be objective about anything where his own interests are involved – that about sums it up. I&#x27;m interested in the brutal and violent nature of man because it&#x27;s a true picture of him. And any attempt to create social institutions on a false view of the nature of man is probably doomed to failure.

&quot;Paths of Glory&quot; is based loosely on the true story of the Souain corporals affair when four French soldiers were executed in 1915 during World War I under General Géraud Réveilhac for failure to follow orders. The soldiers were exonerated posthumously in 1934. The novel is about the French execution of innocent men to strengthen others&#x27; resolve to fight. The French Army did carry out military executions for cowardice, as did most of the other major participants, excluding the United States of America and Australia. The United States sentenced 24 soldiers to death for cowardice, but the sentences were never carried out. However, a significant point in the film is the practice of selecting individuals at random and executing them as a punishment for the sins of the whole group. This is similar to the Roman practice of decimation, which was rarely used by the French Army in World War I.

===Development===
Kubrick said of his decision to make a war film: &quot;One of the attractions of a war or crime story is that it provides an almost unique opportunity to contrast an individual or our contemporary society with a solid framework of accepted value, which the audience becomes fully aware of, and which can be used as a counterpoint to a human, individual, emotional situation. Further, war acts as a kind of hothouse for forced, quick breeding of attitudes and feelings. Attitudes crystallise and come out into the open. Conflict is natural, when it would in a less critical situation have to be introduced almost as a contrivance, and would thus appear forced or, even worse, false.&quot;

Although Kubrick&#x27;s previous film &quot;The Killing&quot; had failed at the box office, it had managed to land on several critical top-ten lists for the year. Dore Schary, then head of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, liked the film and hired Kubrick and Harris to develop film stories from MGM&#x27;s pile of scripts and purchased novels. Finding nothing they liked, Kubrick remembered reading Cobb&#x27;s book at the age of 14 and the &quot;great impact&quot; it had upon him and suggested it as their next project. Schary strongly doubted the commercial success of the story, which had already been turned down by every other major studio.

After Schary was fired by MGM in a major shake-up, Kubrick and Harris managed to interest Kirk Douglas in a script version that Kubrick had done with Calder Willingham. After reading the script, Kirk Douglas was impressed and managed to get an advance for a $1 million budget from United Artists to help produce the film. Of the roughly $1 million budget, more than a third was allocated to Kirk Douglas&#x27; salary. Prior to the involvement of Douglas and his Bryna Production Company, no studio had showed interest in the seemingly noncommercial subject matter and filming in black and white. MGM rejected the idea of the film based on fears that the film would be unfavourable to European distributors and audiences. United Artists agreed to back it with Douglas as the star.

===Writing===
Kubrick eventually hired Calder Willingham to work on the script of &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (1957), of which Jim Thompson had written earlier drafts. The specific contributions by Kubrick, Thompson, and Willingham to the final script were disputed, and the matter went to arbitration with the Writers&#x27; Guild. Willingham claimed that Thompson had minimal involvement in the final script of the film, claiming responsibility for 99 percent of &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; for himself and that Thompson had not written any of the dialogue. When Thompson&#x27;s draft screenplay was compared to the final film, it was clear that Thompson had written seven scenes, including the reconnaissance mission and the scene with soldiers the night before their executions by firing squad. In the end, the Writers&#x27; Guild attributed the script in the order of Kubrick, Willingham and then Thompson.

Parts of the screenplay were taken from Cobb&#x27;s work verbatim. However, Kubrick made several changes to the narrative of the novel in his adaptation, most notably his shift of focus to Colonel Dax, as opposed to Paris, Ferol and Arnaud as in the novel. One speculated addition is when General Mireau says “show me a patriot, and I&#x27;ll show you an honest man”, and Colonel Dax responds that Samuel Johnson once said: “Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel”.

Primarily, Kubrick and Thompson had added a happy ending to the film to make the film more commercial to the general public, where the men&#x27;s lives are saved from execution at the last minute by the general. However, these changes were reversed back more closely to the original novel at the demand of Kirk Douglas. On the Criterion Collection Blu-ray, James B. Harris claims to have gotten this ending past distributors by sending the entire script instead of just the reversed ending, in the knowledge that those distributors would not read through the whole script again. After viewing the film, United Artists was happy with the changes and left the ending as it is.

===Filming===

Production took place entirely in Bavaria, Germany, especially at the Schleissheim Palace near Munich. Timothy Carey was fired during production. He was reportedly extremely difficult to work with, even to the extent of faking his own kidnapping, holding up the whole production. He was replaced in the scenes remaining to be shot with a double. The film cost slightly less than $1 million and just about broke even.

Due to having three years&#x27; military training, around 600 German police officers were used as extras for soldiers. The last scenes filmed were those that take place on the battlefield. For the construction of the battlefield, Kubrick hired 5,000 square yards (0.4 hectares) of land from a local farmer. It took Kubrick a month to set up the filming of the assault, arranging props and tearing up the field to look like a war zone. For the filming of the battle sequence, the battlefield was divided into five regions where explosive charges were specifically placed. This made it easier for Kubrick to film the dying of extras as he split the extras into five groups, one for each of the regions, and each man would die in his own zone by an explosion that was near him.

An early critical test of Kubrick&#x27;s obsession with control on the set came during the making of &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;. As recalled by Kirk Douglas:
The only female character in the film, the woman who sings &quot;The Faithful Hussar&quot;, is portrayed by German actress Christiane Harlan (credited in the film as Susanne Christian). She and Kubrick later married; the couple remained together until his death in 1999. It was on set that they originally had met.

====Kubrick&#x27;s use of visual imagery and mise-en-scene====

&quot;Paths of Glory&quot; employs both camera-work and audio cues to create a sense of realism, thus making it easier for the audience to sympathise with the plight of the accused soldiers. In the beginning of the film a snare drum plays, and the music is reminiscent of war era newsreels. During the battle sequences, the camera keeps pace with the soldiers but in other ways, the shots look like old trench warfare footage from World War I. The film&#x27;s choice of black and white further emphasises its similarity to the actual newsreels of the conflict.

Kubrick&#x27;s vision of war was far bleaker than that of some other films of the era, which also influenced the director&#x27;s choice to shoot the picture in black and white. The visuals also allow the audience to see the difference between &quot;life in the trenches&quot; and &quot;life in the command&quot;. From the opulent mansion of the high-ranking officers, the audience notices wide shots from the exterior and the interior. The viewer misses nothing; every decadent piece of furniture, jewelry or bauble that the senior officers have, in sharp contrast to the trenches where the shots are much tighter. Close ups and point-of-view shots (e.g. from Colonel Dax&#x27;s perspective) are cramped and tight, suffocating for the audience. Switching to a shot in front of Dax&#x27;s person, e.g. a walking shot, the audience becomes much like the other soldiers accompanying him in the trenches, feeling stuck and trapped in the confined and dangerous space.

===Score and use of sounds===
The musical score by Gerald Fried makes extensive use of percussion instruments, specifically military drums.

Kubrick used sound, or the lack thereof, to build tension and suspense in the film, particularly towards the beginning when the three soldiers are given orders to check on the Anthill. This scene is in silence, with no use of diegetic/non-diegetic sound, working well to add depth and rawness. Much of what the viewer can hear throughout the film is explosions in the distance and the sound of a whistle being blown, further adding to the overall documentary style of the film. The lack of a big bold score gives no suggestion of heroism to the plot of the film, and the sounds of people dying are a common trope associated with Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s films. The song towards the ending happens within the narrative. In the tavern with the French soldiers of Dax&#x27;s regiment, a young woman sings a traditional German folk song of that era, &quot;Der treue Husar&quot;. With Kubrick&#x27;s use of mise-en-scene, the audience is able to see the German woman&#x27;s performance bring the men to tears through various close-ups and angles. The troopers begin to hum and eventually sing along to the tune in an expression of their basic humanity. &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; later ends in the same way it began with the familiar snare/drum roll used in the opening, indicative of a lack of change throughout the film. Kubrick&#x27;s use of sounds and song functions as a kind of narration for the audience, linking each sound to a later or earlier scene in the film.

==Release==
The film had its &quot;world premiere&quot; in Munich, Germany, on November 1, 1957. A month and a half before that event, on September 18, a special screening of Kubrick&#x27;s production was also presented in Munich, but then to a very select audience. Frank Gordon, reporting from the Bavarian capital for the widely read New York trade paper &quot;Variety&quot;, describes the earlier presentation in the paper&#x27;s September 27 issue:

In the United States, the picture was not officially released nationwide until January 1958, although it was shown in two major cities prior to that: in Los Angeles, California at the Fine Arts Theatre on December 20, 1957, and then five days later, on Christmas Day, in New York City at the Victoria Theatre. The American trade journal &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot; explained at the time that &quot;Paths&quot; was being shown in those cities before the end of 1957 to ensure the film would qualify for nominations for the next Academy Award ceremonies, which were to be held on March 26, 1958.

===Box office===
Assessments vary with regard to the film&#x27;s ultimate success at the box office, with some sources citing it as a modest financial success and others noting that it only managed to recoup most, if not all, of its production costs. The film did, however, earn Kubrick widespread critical acclaim, while it also generated widespread controversy, especially in Europe.

==Reception and influence==

Although the film did not receive a single nomination for the Academy Awards of 1958, it was nominated for and collected several international awards. Those awards and many positive reviews from film critics further enhanced Kubrick&#x27;s already growing reputation. The film was nominated for a BAFTA Award under the category Best Film but lost to &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;. The production also received in Finland the Jussi Awards&#x27; Diploma of Merit, was nominated for a Writers&#x27; Guild of America Award in 1959, and won the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association. Kubrick himself received on February 17, 1959, in Rome the Italian critics&#x27; Silver Ribbon, an award recognizing him as &quot;the best foreign director of 1958 for his movie &#x27;Paths of Glory&#x27;.&quot;

===Controversy===
On its release, the film&#x27;s anti-military tone was subject to severe public criticism and governmental censorship.

*In France, both active and retired personnel from the French military vehemently criticized the filmand its portrayal of the French Armyafter it was released in Belgium. The French government placed enormous pressure on United Artists (the European distributor) not to release the film in France. The film was eventually shown in France in 1975 when anti-war attitudes were more acceptable.
*The film was withdrawn from the Berlin Film Festival to avoid straining relations with France. It was then not shown in Germany until two years after its theatrical release in the United States.
*In Spain, the fascist government of Francisco Franco objected to the film. It was not shown there until 1986, 11 years after Franco&#x27;s death.
*The Swiss government banned any presentations of the film until 1970 on the grounds that it was &quot;incontestably offensive&quot; to France, its judicial system and its army.
*The film was banned in all United States military establishments, both at home and overseas, due to its content.

===Reviews in the United States, 19571958===
Despite the film&#x27;s harsh reception in Europe by various governments, French war veterans, and media outlets, in the months after the motion picture&#x27;s initial screenings in the United States, reactions to Kubrick&#x27;s production featured in American newspapers and trade publications were generally positive. Nevertheless, perceived deficiencies in the film&#x27;s structure and content were expressed by some of the nation&#x27;s leading reviewers in 1957 and 1958.

====Issues with &quot;colloquial English&quot; dialogue====
In his December 26, 1957, review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther credits Kubrick for creating a visually &quot;terrific&quot;, highly intense picture. In particular, Crowther draws attention to the story&#x27;s execution scene, which he describes as &quot;one of the most craftily directed and emotionally lacerating that we have ever seen.&quot; He does, though, also identify two &quot;troubling flaws&quot; that he saw in the film, one being within the &quot;realm of technique&quot;, the other within the &quot;realm of significance&quot;:

The absence of any spoken French or suitably accented English dialogue in a highly focused portrayal of French soldiers continued to be a point of debate in American critical analysis of &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;. Philip K. Scheuer, who wrote about films for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; from the 1920s to 1967, was another reviewer who addressed the issue again in the newspaper&#x27;s January 16, 1958, edition. In a follow-up discussion about the &quot;controversial war picture&quot;, in a commentary subtitled &quot;Question of Foreign Accents Raised by &#x27;Paths of Glory, Scheuer cites the style of speech used in the film and the screenplay&#x27;s &quot;weak&quot; ending as two reasons he omitted the production from his &quot;selection of 1957&#x27;s best&quot;. Like Bosley Crowther, he found the &quot;linguistic&quot; aspects of the dialogue wholly distracting. &quot;In &#x27;Paths, Scheuer writes, &quot;the actors all...employ ordinary colloquial Englishmuch of it, I felt, delivered badlyalthough Adolph Menjou, being of French descent, did convey a certain quality of Frenchness,&quot; adding, &quot;The others were simply Hollywood types.&quot;

====The film&#x27;s &quot;grim&quot; plot====
The overriding tone of the motion picture also evoked comments about the picture&#x27;s marketability, namely its scant appeal to a very large segment of moviegoers. &quot;Grim&quot; is the word that frequently appears in contemporary reviews of the film, an adjective understandably applied given the story&#x27;s brutal subject matter, and a word still commonly used even in complimentary assessments by critics. In its March 18, 1958 edition, the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; summarizes the release as &quot;a grim, forceful story, presented in blunt, unvarnished fashion, entirely lacking in the customary cliches, deftly directed.&quot; Whitney Williams, a critic for &quot;Variety&quot;, previewed the film six weeks before it opened at the Fine Arts Theatre in Los Angeles. In his review, which was published on November 20, 1957, Williams anticipates limited interest as well as limited box-office revenue for the picture:
&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot;, an independent and advertisement-free film review journal in 1957, agreed with &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s critic and in November expressed doubts too that the &quot;World War I melodrama&quot; would be successful commercially after its general release in January 1958. &quot;Just how it will fare at the box-office is a matter of conjecture&quot;, &quot;Harrison&#x27;s&quot; stated, characterizing its central theme as &quot;a grim and unpleasant study of man&#x27;s inhumanity toward man&quot;.

====Views on the screenplay&#x27;s ending====
Edwin S. Schallert, a fellow critic of Philip Scheuer at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, also attended the film&#x27;s first screening in Los Angeles on December 20, 1957. The following day the newspaper published Schallert&#x27;s evaluation, which begins by classifying &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; as &quot;A minor contribution but an interesting one to the war effort on the screen&quot;. Next he describes the drama&#x27;s storyline in some detail before addressing specifically the film&#x27;s final scene, which he found odd and disconnected in its presentation so soon after &quot;the grim gray execution&quot;. &quot;Susanne Christian&quot;, Schallert writes, &quot;is seen as the German girl forced to sing to a huge body of [French] troops right at the end of the picturea peculiar sort of payoff for the miscarriage of justice to which the whole gathering of men seems to be oblivious.&quot; He then concludes, Paths of Glory&#x27; is a commendably sincere picture, very well told for the most part, though it does not fulfill itself in the best screen and entertainment terms. It is practically like a documentary.&quot;

The review in &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; addressed the ending as well, maintaining that it was the &quot;picture&#x27;s one weak spot&quot;, was &quot;difficult to understand&quot;, and &quot;leaves one with a feeling that it is inconclusive&quot;. The journal then offered its own interpretation of the final scenes. From &quot;Harrison&#x27;s&quot; perspective, as Colonel Dax is returning to his quarters after his confrontations with his superior officers, &quot;he notices his soldiers enjoying themselves in a cafe. It disgusts him to think that they had so quickly forgotten their executed comrades, but he compassionately realizes that life must go on.&quot; Whitney Williams in &quot;Variety&quot; also commented about the film&#x27;s finale, noting that it &quot;ends so abruptly [the] audience is left with a feeling of incompletion.&quot;

Other assorted critics in newspapers and trade publications viewed the film&#x27;s ending and the production&#x27;s significance cinematically far differently than the cited critics at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; or the reviewers for &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;. Richard Gertner of the New York-based trade paper &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot; was one of them. He, unlike Edwin Schallert, did not see &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; as a &quot;minor contribution&quot; to the genre of wartime portrayals. Nor did he find its closing scenes &quot;peculiar&quot;; but instead, &quot;poignant&quot;. After viewing what he termed &quot;a brilliant and arresting film&quot; only a few weeks after its world premiere in Munich, Gertner highly recommended it to his readers, many of whom were theater owners. He then advised those motion picture &quot;exhibitors&quot; not to misjudge the film&#x27;s content in advance:
Finally, in contrast to Philip Scheuer&#x27;s omission of the production from his &quot;selection of 1957&#x27;s best&quot;, Gertner ends his appraisal emphatically: &quot;No doubt about it&#x27;Paths of Glory&#x27; is one of the strongest dramas of the year.&quot;

====Opinions regarding Kubrick&#x27;s direction and editing====
In spite of issues being raised in various reviews about the film&#x27;s manner of dialogue, its anticipated marketing challenges, and its ending, in the United States in 1957 and 1958 there was near universal admiration expressed for the directorial abilities and technical expertise that the 29-year-old Kubrick exhibited in the production. Jay Carmodythe drama critic for &quot;The Evening Star&quot; in Washington, D.C., and winner of the Screen Directors Guild&#x27;s &quot;Critic of the Year&quot; award for 1956commended Kubrick for directing a &quot;film with sting&quot; and doing so with &quot;chilling &quot;. At the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, critic William Zinsser judges the film to be &quot;outstanding&quot; in his December 26, 1957 review and describes Kubrick&#x27;s direction and editing as first-rate. &quot;His scenes&quot;, Zinsser observes, &quot;are vivid and well composed, and he knows the art of cuttingthe scenes make their point, with economy and bite, and move on.&quot; Even at this relatively early stage in Kubrick&#x27;s career directing feature films, he had already gained a reputation in the motion picture industry for commanding all aspects of his projects and being, as one colleague described him, &quot;&#x27;meticulous with everything, from scripting to editing&#x27;&quot;. What is notably missing, however, from Zinsser&#x27;s comments or in other contemporary reviews about the quality of the production&#x27;s &quot;cutting&quot; are any allusions to Eva Kroll, the film&#x27;s credited editor, and to her contributions in helping to construct or at least refine the end product.

===Later reactions and references to the film===
More than three decades after the release of &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, American director Robert Zemeckis paid homage to the film with the 1991 &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; episode &quot;Yellow&quot;. The episode was an adaptation of the 1952 &quot;Shock SuspenStories&quot; story, &quot;Yellow!&quot;, about a U.S. Army colonel whose son, a lieutenant, exhibits cowardice and is sentenced to face the firing squad. The father makes the son falsely believe that the firing squad will be firing blanks, so that the son will not exhibit cowardice before his execution. Zemeckis cast Kirk Douglas and his son Eric Douglas in the father and son roles.

David Simon, creator of the critically acclaimed television series &quot;The Wire&quot; (20022008), has said that &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; was a key influence on the HBO crime drama. The influence of the film comes in its depiction of the tribulations of &quot;middle management&quot;, in the form of Dax&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to protect his troops against the inhumane ambitions of his superiors, which in turn influenced &quot;The Wire&quot;&#x27;s depiction of various institutions acting against individuals.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list on February 25, 2005. Years earlier, on a 1987 episode of the televised film review series &quot;At the Movies&quot;, critic Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; debated with co-host Ebert about the respective merits of several Kubrick productions. Siskel in their discussions declared &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; to be &quot;a near perfect film,&quot; one that in his opinion was surpassed in overall quality only by Kubrick&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;.

An indication of the film&#x27;s enduring popularity can be found on the American review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. As of 2022, the film holds a 96% rating based on 75 reviews with an average rating of 9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Paths of Glory&quot; is a transcendentally humane war movie from Stanley Kubrick, with impressive, protracted battle sequences and a knock-out ending.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 90 out of 100 based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

==Preservation and restoration==
In 1992, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In October and November 2004 the film was shown at the London Film Festival by the British Film Institute. It was carefully remastered over a period of several years; the original film elements were found to be damaged. However, with the aid of several modern digital studios in Los Angeles the film was completely restored and remastered for modern cinema. In addition, Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s widow Christiane (who also appears in the closing scene as the German singer) made a guest appearance at the start of the performance.

==Home media==
&quot;Paths of Glory&quot; was released on VHS on July 21, 1997, followed by the DVD version on June 29, 1999. The Criterion Collection&#x27;s first release of the film was for a Laserdisc release in 1989. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection with a high-definition digital transfer on October 26, 2010.
Eureka released a UK Region B Blu-Ray in 2016 as part of its Masters of Cinema line.

In 2022, Kino Lorber have detailed their upcoming 4K Blu-ray release of the film, restored from the original camera negative. This release also features an audio commentary by critic Tim Lucas. This edition was released on August 23, 2022.

<doc id="23259" wikidata="Q18334" url="?curid=23259" title="Particle physics">
<text>Particle physics or high-energy physics is the study of fundamental particles and forces that constitute matter and radiation. The field also studies combinations of elementary particles up to the scale of protons and neutrons, while the study of combination of protons and neutrons is called nuclear physics.

The fundamental particles in the universe are classified in the Standard Model as fermions (matter particles) and bosons (force-carrying particles). There are three generations of fermions, although ordinary matter is made only from the first fermion generation. The first generation consists of up and down quarks which form protons and neutrons, and electrons and electron neutrinos. The three fundamental interactions known to be mediated by bosons are electromagnetism, the weak interaction, and the strong interaction.

Quarks cannot exist on their own but form hadrons. Hadrons that contain an odd number of quarks are called baryons and those that contain an even number are called mesons. Two baryons, the proton and the neutron, make up most of the mass of ordinary matter. Mesons are unstable and the longest-lived last for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. They occur after collisions between particles made of quarks, such as fast-moving protons and neutrons in cosmic rays. Mesons are also produced in cyclotrons or other particle accelerators.

Particles have corresponding antiparticles with the same mass but with opposite electric charges. For example, the antiparticle of the electron is the positron. The electron has a negative electric charge, the positron has a positive charge. These antiparticles can theoretically form a corresponding form of matter called antimatter. Some particles, such as the photon, are their own antiparticle.

These elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. The reconciliation of gravity to the current particle physics theory is not solved; many theories have addressed this problem, such as loop quantum gravity, string theory and supersymmetry theory.

Practical particle physics is the study of these particles in radioactive processes and in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider. Theoretical particle physics is the study of these particles in the context of cosmology and quantum theory. The two are closely interrelated: the Higgs boson was postulated by theoretical particle physicists and its presence confirmed by practical experiments.

== History ==
The idea that all matter is fundamentally composed of elementary particles dates from at least the 6th century BC. In the 19th century, John Dalton, through his work on stoichiometry, concluded that each element of nature was composed of a single, unique type of particle. The word &quot;atom&quot;, after the Greek word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;indivisible&quot;, has since then denoted the smallest particle of a chemical element, but physicists later discovered that atoms are not, in fact, the fundamental particles of nature, but are conglomerates of even smaller particles, such as the electron. The early 20th century explorations of nuclear physics and quantum physics led to proofs of nuclear fission in 1939 by Lise Meitner (based on experiments by Otto Hahn), and nuclear fusion by Hans Bethe in that same year; both discoveries also led to the development of nuclear weapons. Bethe&#x27;s 1947 calculation of the Lamb shift is credited with having &quot;opened the way to the modern era of particle physics&quot;.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a bewildering variety of particles was found in collisions of particles from beams of increasingly high energy. It was referred to informally as the &quot;particle zoo&quot;. Important discoveries such as the CP violation by James Cronin and Val Fitch brought new questions to matter-antimatter imbalance. After the formulation of the Standard Model during the 1970s, physicists clarified the origin of the particle zoo. The large number of particles was explained as combinations of a (relatively) small number of more fundamental particles and framed in the context of quantum field theories. This reclassification marked the beginning of modern particle physics.

== Standard Model ==
The current state of the classification of all elementary particles is explained by the Standard Model, which gained widespread acceptance in the mid-1970s after experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. It describes the strong, weak, and electromagnetic fundamental interactions, using mediating gauge bosons. The species of gauge bosons are eight gluons, , and bosons, and the photon. The Standard Model also contains 24 fundamental fermions (12 particles and their associated anti-particles), which are the constituents of all matter. Finally, the Standard Model also predicted the existence of a type of boson known as the Higgs boson. On 4 July 2012, physicists with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN announced they had found a new particle that behaves similarly to what is expected from the Higgs boson.

The Standard Model, as currently formulated, has 61 elementary particles. Those elementary particles can combine to form composite particles, accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960s. The Standard Model has been found to agree with almost all the experimental tests conducted to date. However, most particle physicists believe that it is an incomplete description of nature and that a more fundamental theory awaits discovery (See Theory of Everything). In recent years, measurements of neutrino mass have provided the first experimental deviations from the Standard Model, since neutrinos do not have mass in the Standard Model.

== Subatomic particles ==
Modern particle physics research is focused on subatomic particles, including atomic constituents, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons (protons and neutrons are composite particles called baryons, made of quarks), that are produced by radioactive and scattering processes; such particles are photons, neutrinos, and muons, as well as a wide range of exotic particles. All particles and their interactions observed to date can be described almost entirely by the Standard Model.

Dynamics of particles are also governed by quantum mechanics; they exhibit wave–particle duality, displaying particle-like behaviour under certain experimental conditions and wave-like behaviour in others. In more technical terms, they are described by quantum state vectors in a Hilbert space, which is also treated in quantum field theory. Following the convention of particle physicists, the term &quot;elementary particles&quot; is applied to those particles that are, according to current understanding, presumed to be indivisible and not composed of other particles.

=== Quarks and leptons ===
Ordinary matter is made from first-generation quarks (up, down) and leptons (electron, electron neutrino). Collectively, quarks and leptons are called fermions, because they have a quantum spin of half-integers (−1/2, 1/2, 3/2, etc.). This causes the fermions to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, where no two particles may occupy the same quantum state. Quarks have fractional elementary electric charge (−1/3 or 2/3) and leptons have whole-numbered electric charge (0 or -1). Quarks also have color charge, which is labeled arbitrarily with no correlation to actual light color as red, green and blue. Because the interactions between the quarks store energy which can convert to other particles when the quarks are far apart enough, quarks cannot be observed independently. This is called color confinement.

There are three known generations of quarks (up and down, strange and charm, top and bottom) and leptons (electron and its neutrino, muon and its neutrino, tau and its neutrino), with strong indirect evidence that a fourth generation of fermions does not exist.

=== Bosons ===
Bosons are the mediators or carriers of fundamental interactions, such as electromagnetism, the weak interaction, and the strong interaction. Electromagnetism is mediated by the photon, the quanta of light. The weak interaction is mediated by the W and Z bosons. The strong interaction is mediated by the gluon, which can link quarks together to form composite particles. Due to the aforementioned color confinement, gluons are never observed independently. The Higgs boson gives mass to the W and Z bosons via the Higgs mechanism – the gluon and photon are expected to be massless. All bosons have an integer quantum spin (0 and 1) and can have the same quantum state.

=== Antiparticles and color charge ===
Most aforementioned particles have corresponding antiparticles, which compose antimatter. Normal particles have positive lepton or baryon number, and antiparticles have these numbers negative. Most properties of corresponding antiparticles and particles are the same, with a few gets reversed; the electron&#x27;s antiparticle, positron, has an opposite charge. To differentiate between antiparticles and particles, a plus or negative sign is added in superscript. For example, the electron and the positron are denoted and . However, in the case that the particle has a charge of 0 (equal to that of the antiparticle), the antiparticle is denoted with a line above the symbol. As such, an electron neutrino is , whereas its antineutrino is . When a particle and an antiparticle interact with each other, they are annihilated and convert to other particles. Some particles, such as the photon or gluon, have no antiparticles.

Quarks and gluons additionally have color charges, which influences the strong interaction. Quark&#x27;s color charges are called red, green and blue (though the particle itself have no physical color), and in antiquarks are called antired, antigreen and antiblue. The gluon can have eight color charges, which are the result of quarks&#x27; interactions to form composite particles (gauge symmetry SU(3)).

=== Composite ===
The neutrons and protons in the atomic nuclei are baryons – the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark, and the proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark. A baryon is composed of three quarks, and a meson is composed of two quarks (one normal, one anti). Baryons and mesons are collectively called hadrons. Quarks inside hadrons are governed by the strong interaction, thus are subjected to quantum chromodynamics (color charges). The bounded quarks must have their color charge to be neutral, or &quot;white&quot; for analogy with mixing the primary colors. More exotic hadrons can have other types, arrangement or number of quarks (tetraquark, pentaquark).

An atom is made from protons, neutrons and electrons. By modifying the particles inside a normal atom, exotic atoms can be formed. A simple example would be the hydrogen-4.1, which has one of its electrons replaced with a muon.

=== Hypothetical ===
The graviton is a hypothetical particle that can mediate the gravitational interaction, but it has not been detected or completely reconciled with current theories. Many other hypothetical particles have been proposed to address the limitations of the Standard Model. Notably, supersymmetric particles aim to solve the hierarchy problem, axions address the strong CP problem, and various other particles are proposed to explain the origins of dark matter and dark energy.

== Experimental laboratories ==

The world&#x27;s major particle physics laboratories are:
* Brookhaven National Laboratory (Long Island, New York, United States). Its main facility is the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), which collides heavy ions such as gold ions and polarized protons. It is the world&#x27;s first heavy ion collider, and the world&#x27;s only polarized proton collider.
* Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (Novosibirsk, Russia). Its main projects are now the electron-positron colliders VEPP-2000, operated since 2006, and VEPP-4, started experiments in 1994. Earlier facilities include the first electron–electron beam–beam collider VEP-1, which conducted experiments from 1964 to 1968; the electron-positron colliders VEPP-2, operated from 1965 to 1974; and, its successor VEPP-2M, performed experiments from 1974 to 2000.
* CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) (Franco-Swiss border, near Geneva, Switzerland). Its main project is now the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which had its first beam circulation on 10 September 2008, and is now the world&#x27;s most energetic collider of protons. It also became the most energetic collider of heavy ions after it began colliding lead ions. Earlier facilities include the Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP), which was stopped on 2 November 2000 and then dismantled to give way for LHC; and the Super Proton Synchrotron, which is being reused as a pre-accelerator for the LHC and for fixed-target experiments.
* DESY (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron) (Hamburg, Germany). Its main facility was the Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage (HERA), which collided electrons and positrons with protons. The accelerator complex is now focused on the production of synchrotron radiation with PETRA III, FLASH and the European XFEL.
* Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) (Batavia, Illinois, United States). Its main facility until 2011 was the Tevatron, which collided protons and antiprotons and was the highest-energy particle collider on earth until the Large Hadron Collider surpassed it on 29 November 2009.
* Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) (Beijing, China). IHEP manages a number of China&#x27;s major particle physics facilities, including the Beijing Electron–Positron Collider II(BEPC II), the Beijing Spectrometer (BES), the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), the International Cosmic-Ray Observatory at Yangbajing in Tibet, the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment, the China Spallation Neutron Source, the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT), and the Accelerator-driven Sub-critical System (ADS) as well as the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO).
* KEK (Tsukuba, Japan). It is the home of a number of experiments such as the K2K experiment, a neutrino oscillation experiment and Belle II, an experiment measuring the CP violation of B mesons.
* SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (Menlo Park, California, United States). Its 2-mile-long linear particle accelerator began operating in 1962 and was the basis for numerous electron and positron collision experiments until 2008. Since then the linear accelerator is being used for the Linac Coherent Light Source X-ray laser as well as advanced accelerator design research. SLAC staff continue to participate in developing and building many particle detectors around the world.

== Theory ==

Theoretical particle physics attempts to develop the models, theoretical framework, and mathematical tools to understand current experiments and make predictions for future experiments (see also theoretical physics). There are several major interrelated efforts being made in theoretical particle physics today.

One important branch attempts to better understand the Standard Model and its tests. Theorists make quantitative predictions of observables at collider and astronomical experiments, which along with experimental measurements is used to extract the parameters of the Standard Model with less uncertainty. This work probes the limits of the Standard Model and therefore expands scientific understanding of nature&#x27;s building blocks. Those efforts are made challenging by the difficulty of calculating high precision quantities in quantum chromodynamics. Some theorists working in this area use the tools of perturbative quantum field theory and effective field theory, referring to themselves as phenomenologists. Others make use of lattice field theory and call themselves &quot;lattice theorists&quot;.

Another major effort is in model building where model builders develop ideas for what physics may lie beyond the Standard Model (at higher energies or smaller distances). This work is often motivated by the hierarchy problem and is constrained by existing experimental data. It may involve work on supersymmetry, alternatives to the Higgs mechanism, extra spatial dimensions (such as the Randall–Sundrum models), Preon theory, combinations of these, or other ideas. Vanishing-dimensions theory is a particle physics theory suggesting that systems with higher energy have a smaller number of dimensions.

A third major effort in theoretical particle physics is string theory. &quot;String theorists&quot; attempt to construct a unified description of quantum mechanics and general relativity by building a theory based on small strings, and branes rather than particles. If the theory is successful, it may be considered a &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;, or &quot;TOE&quot;.

There are also other areas of work in theoretical particle physics ranging from particle cosmology to loop quantum gravity.

== Practical applications ==
In principle, all physics (and practical applications developed therefrom) can be derived from the study of fundamental particles. In practice, even if &quot;particle physics&quot; is taken to mean only &quot;high-energy atom smashers&quot;, many technologies have been developed during these pioneering investigations that later find wide uses in society. Particle accelerators are used to produce medical isotopes for research and treatment (for example, isotopes used in PET imaging), or used directly in external beam radiotherapy. The development of superconductors has been pushed forward by their use in particle physics. The World Wide Web and touchscreen technology were initially developed at CERN. Additional applications are found in medicine, national security, industry, computing, science, and workforce development, illustrating a long and growing list of beneficial practical applications with contributions from particle physics.

== Future ==
Major efforts to look for physics beyond the Standard Model include the Future Circular Collider proposed for CERN and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) in the US that will update the 2014 P5 study that recommended the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, among other experiments.

<doc id="23260" wikidata="Q1863530" url="?curid=23260" title="List of peninsulas">
<text>A peninsula ( from &quot;paene&quot; &quot;almost&quot; and &quot;insula&quot; &quot;island&quot;) is a piece of land that is bordered mostly by water but connected to mainland. The surrounding water is usually understood to be continuous, though not necessarily named as such. A peninsula can also be a headland, cape, island promontory, bill, point,
or spit. A point is generally considered a tapering piece of land projecting into a body of water that is less prominent than a cape. In English, the plural of peninsula is &quot;peninsulas&quot; or, less commonly, &quot;peninsulae&quot;. A river which courses through a very tight meander is also sometimes said to form a &quot;peninsula&quot; within the (almost closed) loop of water.

==Europe==
Europe is sometimes considered to be a large peninsula extending off Eurasia. As such, it is one of the largest peninsulas in the world and the only one to have the status as a full continent, largely as a matter of convention rather than science. It is composed of many smaller peninsulas, the four main and largest component peninsulas being the Scandinavian, Iberian, Balkan, and Apennine peninsulas.

=== Balkan Peninsula ===
The Balkans is a region which natural borders do not coincide with the technical definition of a peninsula hence modern geographers reject the idea of a Balkan Peninsula. It would include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and the European part of Turkey.

<text>Physical geography (also known as physiography) is one of the three main branches of geography. Physical geography is the branch of natural science which deals with the processes and patterns in the natural environment such as the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere. This focus is in contrast with the branch of human geography, which focuses on the built environment, and technical geography, which focuses on using, studying, and creating tools to obtain, analyze, interpret, and understand spatial information. The three branches have significant overlap, however.

== Sub-branches ==

Physical geography can be divided into several branches or related fields, as follows:

* Geomorphology is concerned with understanding the surface of the Earth and the processes by which it is shaped, both at the present as well as in the past. Geomorphology as a field has several sub-fields that deal with the specific landforms of various environments, e.g. desert geomorphology and fluvial geomorphology; however, these sub-fields are united by the core processes which cause them, mainly tectonic or climatic processes. Geomorphology seeks to understand landform history and dynamics, and predict future changes through a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling (Geomorphometry). Early studies in geomorphology are the foundation for pedology, one of two main branches of soil science.

* Hydrology is predominantly concerned with the amounts and quality of water moving and accumulating on the land surface and in the soils and rocks near the surface and is typified by the hydrological cycle. Thus the field encompasses water in rivers, lakes, aquifers and to an extent glaciers, in which the field examines the process and dynamics involved in these bodies of water. Hydrology has historically had an important connection with engineering and has thus developed a largely quantitative method in its research; however, it does have an earth science side that embraces the systems approach. Similar to most fields of physical geography it has sub-fields that examine the specific bodies of water or their interaction with other spheres e.g. limnology and ecohydrology.
*Glaciology is the study of glaciers and ice sheets, or more commonly the cryosphere or ice and phenomena that involve ice. Glaciology groups the latter (ice sheets) as continental glaciers and the former (glaciers) as alpine glaciers. Although research in the areas is similar to research undertaken into both the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers, the former tends to be concerned with the interaction of ice sheets with the present climate and the latter with the impact of glaciers on the landscape. Glaciology also has a vast array of sub-fields examining the factors and processes involved in ice sheets and glaciers e.g. snow hydrology and glacial geology.
* Biogeography is the science which deals with geographic patterns of species distribution and the processes that result in these patterns. Biogeography emerged as a field of study as a result of the work of Alfred Russel Wallace, although the field prior to the late twentieth century had largely been viewed as historic in its outlook and descriptive in its approach. The main stimulus for the field since its founding has been that of evolution, plate tectonics and the theory of island biogeography. The field can largely be divided into five sub-fields: island biogeography, paleobiogeography, phylogeography, zoogeography and phytogeography.
* Climatology is the study of the climate, scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a long period of time. Climatology examines both the nature of micro (local) and macro (global) climates and the natural and influences on them. The field is also sub-divided largely into the climates of various regions and the study of specific phenomena or time periods e.g. tropical cyclone rainfall climatology and paleoclimatology.
* Soil geography deals with the distribution of soils across the terrain. This discipline, between geography and soil science, is fundamental to both physical geography and pedology. Pedology is the study of soils in their natural environment. It deals with pedogenesis, soil morphology, soil classification. Soil geography studies the spatial distribution of soils as it relates to topography, climate (water, air, temperature), soil life (micro-organisms, plants, animals) and mineral materials within soils (biogeochemical cycles).
* Palaeogeography is a cross-disciplinary study that examines the preserved material in the stratigraphic record to determine the distribution of the continents through geologic time. Almost all the evidence for the positions of the continents comes from geology in the form of fossils or paleomagnetism. The use of these data has resulted in evidence for continental drift, plate tectonics, and supercontinents. This, in turn, has supported palaeogeographic theories such as the Wilson cycle.
* Coastal geography is the study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology, and oceanography) and the human geography of the coast. It involves an understanding of coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weathering, and also the ways in which humans interact with the coast. Coastal geography, although predominantly geomorphological in its research, is not just concerned with coastal landforms, but also the causes and influences of sea level change.
* Oceanography is the branch of physical geography that studies the Earth&#x27;s oceans and seas. It covers a wide range of topics, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics (biological oceanography); ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics (physical oceanography); plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor (geological oceanography); and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries (chemical oceanography). These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within it.
* Quaternary science is an interdisciplinary field of study focusing on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years. The field studies the last ice age and the recent interstadial the Holocene and uses proxy evidence to reconstruct the past environments during this period to infer the climatic and environmental changes that have occurred.
* Landscape ecology is a sub-discipline of ecology and geography that address how spatial variation in the landscape affects ecological processes such as the distribution and flow of energy, materials, and individuals in the environment (which, in turn, may influence the distribution of landscape &quot;elements&quot; themselves such as hedgerows). The field was largely funded by the German geographer Carl Troll. Landscape ecology typically deals with problems in an applied and holistic context. The main difference between biogeography and landscape ecology is that the latter is concerned with how flows or energy and material are changed and their impacts on the landscape whereas the former is concerned with the spatial patterns of species and chemical cycles.
* Geomatics is the field of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information. Geomatics includes geodesy (scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the earth, its gravitational field, and other geodynamic phenomena, such as crustal motion, oceanic tides, and polar motion), cartography, geographical information science (GIS) and remote sensing (the short or large-scale acquisition of information of an object or phenomenon, by the use of either recording or real-time sensing devices that are not in physical or intimate contact with the object).
* Environmental geography is a branch of geography that analyzes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. The branch bridges the divide between human and physical geography and thus requires an understanding of the dynamics of geology, meteorology, hydrology, biogeography, and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment. Although the branch was previously more visible in research than at present with theories such as environmental determinism linking society with the environment. It has largely become the domain of the study of environmental management or anthropogenic influences.

==Journals and literature==
&quot;Main category:&quot; Geography Journals

Mental geography and earth science journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions. Most journals cover a specific publish the research within that field, however unlike human geographers, physical geographers tend to publish in inter-disciplinary journals rather than predominantly geography journal; the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Additionally, textbooks, books, and communicate research to laypeople, although these tend to focus on environmental issues or cultural dilemmas. Examples of journals that publish articles from physical geographers are:
==Historical evolution of the discipline==
From the birth of geography as a science during the Greek classical period and until the late nineteenth century with the birth of anthropogeography (human geography), geography was almost exclusively a natural science: the study of location and descriptive gazetteer of all places of the known world. Several works among the best known during this long period could be cited as an example, from Strabo (&quot;Geography&quot;), Eratosthenes (&quot;Geographika&quot;) or Dionysius Periegetes (&quot;Periegesis Oiceumene&quot;) in the Ancient Age. In more modern times, these works include the Alexander von Humboldt (&quot;Kosmos&quot;) in the nineteenth century, in which geography is regarded as a physical and natural science through the work &quot;Summa de Geografía&quot; of Martín Fernández de Enciso from the early sixteenth century, which indicated for the first time the New World.

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a controversy exported from geology, between supporters of James Hutton (uniformitarianism thesis) and Georges Cuvier (catastrophism) strongly influenced the field of geography, because geography at this time was a natural science.

Two historical events during the nineteenth century had a great effect on the further development of physical geography. The first was the European colonial expansion in Asia, Africa, Australia and even America in search of raw materials required by industries during the Industrial Revolution. This fostered the creation of geography departments in the universities of the colonial powers and the birth and development of national geographical societies, thus giving rise to the process identified by Horacio Capel as the institutionalization of geography.

The exploration of Siberia is an example. In the mid-eighteenth century, many geographers were sent to perform geographical surveys in the area of Arctic Siberia. Among these is who is considered the patriarch of Russian geography, Mikhail Lomonosov. In the mid-1750s Lomonosov began working in the Department of Geography, Academy of Sciences to conduct research in Siberia. They showed the organic origin of soil and developed a comprehensive law on the movement of the ice, thereby founding a new branch of geography: glaciology. In 1755 on his initiative was founded Moscow University where he promoted the study of geography and the training of geographers. In 1758 he was appointed director of the Department of Geography, Academy of Sciences, a post from which would develop a working methodology for geographical survey guided by the most important long expeditions and geographical studies in Russia.

The contributions of the Russian school became more frequent through his disciples, and in the nineteenth century we have great geographers such as Vasily Dokuchaev who performed works of great importance as a &quot;principle of comprehensive analysis of the territory&quot; and &quot;Russian Chernozem&quot;. In the latter, he introduced the geographical concept of soil, as distinct from a simple geological stratum, and thus found a new geographic area of study: pedology. Climatology also received a strong boost from the Russian school by Wladimir Köppen whose main contribution, climate classification, is still valid today. However, this great geographer also contributed to the paleogeography through his work &quot;The climates of the geological past&quot; which is considered the father of paleoclimatology. Russian geographers who made great contributions to the discipline in this period were: NM Sibirtsev, Pyotr Semyonov, K.D. Glinka, Neustrayev, among others.

The second important process is the theory of evolution by Darwin in mid-century (which decisively influenced the work of Friedrich Ratzel, who had academic training as a zoologist and was a follower of Darwin&#x27;s ideas) which meant an important impetus in the development of Biogeography.

Another major event in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries took place in the United States. William Morris Davis not only made important contributions to the establishment of discipline in his country but revolutionized the field to develop cycle of erosion theory which he proposed as a paradigm for geography in general, although in actually served as a paradigm for physical geography. His theory explained that mountains and other landforms are shaped by factors that are manifested cyclically. He explained that the cycle begins with the lifting of the relief by geological processes (faults, volcanism, tectonic upheaval, etc.). Factors such as rivers and runoff begin to create V-shaped valleys between the mountains (the stage called &quot;youth&quot;). During this first stage, the terrain is steeper and more irregular. Over time, the currents can carve wider valleys (&quot;maturity&quot;) and then start to wind, towering hills only (&quot;senescence&quot;). Finally, everything comes to what is a plain flat plain at the lowest elevation possible (called &quot;baseline&quot;) This plain was called by Davis&#x27; &quot;peneplain&quot; meaning &quot;almost plain&quot; Then river rejuvenation occurs and there is another mountain lift and the cycle continues.

Although Davis&#x27;s theory is not entirely accurate, it was absolutely revolutionary and unique in its time and helped to modernize and create a geography subfield of geomorphology. Its implications prompted a myriad of research in various branches of physical geography. In the case of the Paleogeography, this theory provided a model for understanding the evolution of the landscape. For hydrology, glaciology, and climatology as a boost investigated as studying geographic factors shape the landscape and affect the cycle. The bulk of the work of William Morris Davis led to the development of a new branch of physical geography: Geomorphology whose contents until then did not differ from the rest of geography. Shortly after this branch would present a major development. Some of his disciples made significant contributions to various branches of physical geography such as Curtis Marbut and his invaluable legacy for Pedology, Mark Jefferson, Isaiah Bowman, among others.

<text>In geography, a plain, commonly known as flatland, is a flat expanse of land that generally does not change much in elevation, and is primarily treeless. Plains occur as lowlands along valleys or at the base of mountains, as coastal plains, and as plateaus or uplands. Plains are one of the major landforms on earth, being present on all continents and covering more than one-third of the world&#x27;s land area. Plains in many areas are important for agriculture. There are various types of plains and biomes on them.

== Description ==

A plain or flatland is a flat expanse of land with a layer of grass that generally does not change much in elevation, and is primarily treeless. Plains occur as lowlands along valleys or at the base of mountains, as coastal plains, and as plateaus or uplands. Plains are one of the major landforms on earth, where they are present on all continents, and cover more than one-third of the world&#x27;s land area.

In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides, but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains, or by cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometimes termed a gap). Coastal plains mostly rise from sea level until they run into elevated features such as mountains or plateaus. Plains can be formed from flowing lava; from deposition of sediment by water, ice, or wind; or formed by erosion by the agents from hills or mountains.

Biomes on plains include grassland (temperate or subtropical), steppe (semi-arid), savannah (tropical) or tundra (polar). In a few instances, deserts and rainforests may also be considered plains.

Plains in many areas are important for agriculture because where the soils were deposited as sediments they may be deep and fertile, and the flatness facilitates mechanization of crop production; or because they support grasslands which provide good grazing for livestock.

==Types of plain==


===Depositional plains===
The types of depositional plains include:
* Abyssal plains, flat or very gently sloping areas of the deep ocean basin.
* Planitia , the Latin word for plain, is used in the naming of plains on extraterrestrial objects (planets and moons), such as Hellas Planitia on Mars or Sedna Planitia on Venus.
* Alluvial plains, which are formed by rivers and which may be one of these overlapping types:
** Alluvial plains, formed over a long period of time by a river depositing sediment on their flood plains or beds, which become alluvial soil. The difference between a flood plain and an alluvial plain is: a flood plain represents areas experiencing flooding fairly regularly in the present or recently, whereas an alluvial plain includes areas where a flood plain is now and used to be, or areas which only experience flooding a few times a century.
** Flood plain, adjacent to a lake, river, stream, or wetland that experiences occasional or periodic flooding.
** Scroll plain, a plain through which a river meanders with a very low gradient.
* Glacial plains, formed by the movement of glaciers under the force of gravity:
** Outwash plain (also known as sandur; plural sandar), a glacial out-wash plain formed of sediments deposited by melt-water at the terminus of a glacier. Sandar consist mainly of stratified (layered and sorted) gravel and sand.
** Till plains, plain of glacial till that form when a sheet of ice becomes detached from the main body of a glacier and melts in place depositing the sediments it carries. Till plains are composed of unsorted material (till) of all sizes.
* Lacustrine plains, plains that originally formed in a lacustrine environment, that is, as the bed of a lake.
* Lava plains, formed by sheets of flowing lava.

===Erosional plains===
Erosional plains have been leveled by various agents of denudation such as running water, rivers, wind and glacier which wear out the rugged surface and smoothens them. Plain resulting from the action of these agents of denudation are called &quot;peneplains&quot; (almost plain) while plains formed from wind action are called &quot;pediplains&quot;.

===Structural plains===
Structural plains are relatively undisturbed horizontal surfaces of the Earth. They are structurally depressed areas of the world that make up some of the most extensive natural lowlands on the Earth&#x27;s surface.

<text>Peter Altenberg (9 March 1859 – 8 January 1919) was a writer and poet from Vienna, Austria. He played a key role in the genesis of early modernism in the city.

==Biography==
He was born Richard Engländer on 9 March 1859 in Vienna into a Jewish family. The nom de plume, &quot;Altenberg&quot;, came from a small town on the Danube river. Allegedly, he chose the &quot;Peter&quot; to honor a young girl whom he remembered as an unrequited love (it had been her nickname). Although he grew up in a middle class Jewish family, Altenberg eventually separated himself from his family of origin by dropping out of both law and medical school, and embracing Bohemianism as a permanent lifestyle choice. He cultivated a feminine appearance and feminine handwriting, wore a cape, sandals and a broad-brimmed hat, and despised &#x27;macho&#x27; masculinity.

Discovered by Arthur Schnitzler in 1894 and appreciated by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Karl Kraus, Altenberg was one of the main proponents of Viennese Impressionism. He was a master of short, aphoristic stories based on close observation of everyday life events. After reading Altenberg&#x27;s first published collection &quot;Wie ich es sehe&quot; (1896) Hofmannsthal wrote: &quot;Even though entirely unconcerned with things important, the book has such a good conscience that one can immediately see that it cannot possibly be a German book. It is truly Viennese. It flaunts it – its origin – as it flaunts its attitude.&quot;

At the fin de siècle, when Vienna was a major crucible and center for modern arts and culture, Altenberg was a very influential part of a literary and artistic movement known as Jung-Wien (Young Vienna). Altenberg was a contemporary of Karl Kraus, Gustav Mahler, Arthur Schnitzler, Gustav Klimt, and Adolf Loos, with whom he had a very close relationship. He was somewhat older, in his early 30s, than the others. His oeuvre consists of short, poetic prose pieces that do not easily fit into usual formal categories. The inspiration for his trademark short prose he drew from the concise aesthetic of Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s prose poems and the spatial limitations of the &#x27;Correspondenzkarte,&#x27; the postcard, first launched and disseminated in his native Austria in 1869.

He became well known throughout Vienna after the publication of a book of his fragmentary observations of women and children in everyday street activities. Because most of his literary work was written while he frequented various Viennese bars and coffeehouses, Altenberg is sometimes referred to as a cabaret or coffee house poet. His favorite coffeehouse was the Café Central, to which he even had his mail delivered.

Altenberg&#x27;s detractors said he was a drug addict and a womanizer. Altenberg was also rumored to have problems with alcoholism and mental illness. Yet his admirers considered him to be a highly creative individual with a great love for the aesthetic, for nature, and for young girls. He is certainly known to have had a large collection of photographs and drawings of young girls, and those who knew him well (such as the daughter of his publisher) wrote of his adoration of young girls.

Altenberg was never a commercially successful writer, but he did enjoy most if not all of the benefits of fame in his lifetime. Altenberg was at one point nominated for the Nobel Prize. Some of the aphoristic poetry he wrote on the backs of postcards and scraps of paper were set to music by composer Alban Berg. In 1913, Berg&#x27;s &quot;Five songs on picture postcard texts by Peter Altenberg&quot; were premiered in Vienna. The piece caused an uproar, and the performance had to be halted: a complete performance of the work was not given until 1952.

Altenberg, like many writers and artists, was constantly short of money, but he was adept at making friends, cultivating patrons, and convincing others to pay for his meals, his champagne, even his rent, with which he was frequently late. He repaid his debts with his talent, his wit, and his charm. Many academics consider him to have been a &quot;bohemian&#x27;s bohemian.&quot;
Most of Altenberg&#x27;s work is published in the German language and, outside of anthology pieces, is difficult to find. Much of it remains in university libraries or private collections. Two selections have been translated, &quot;Evocations of Love&quot; (1960) and &quot;Telegrams of the Soul: Selected Prose of Peter Altenberg&quot; (2005).

Altenberg, who never married, died on 8 January 1919, aged 59, of pneumonia. He is buried at Central Cemetery in Vienna, Austria.

<text>Palestinians () are an Arab ethnonational group native to the region of Palestine.

In 1919, Palestinian Muslims and Palestinian Christians constituted 90 percent of the population of Palestine, just before the third wave of Jewish immigration and the setting up of British Mandatory Palestine after World War I. Opposition to Jewish immigration spurred the consolidation of a unified national identity, though Palestinian society was still fragmented by regional, class, religious, and family differences. The history of the Palestinian national identity is a disputed issue amongst scholars. For some, the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; is used to refer to the nationalist concept of a Palestinian people by Palestinian Arabs from the late 19th century and in the pre-World War I period, while others assert the Palestinian identity encompasses the heritage of all eras from biblical times up to the Ottoman period. After the Israeli Declaration of Independence, the 1948 Palestinian expulsion, and more so after the 1967 Palestinian exodus, the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; evolved into a sense of a shared future in the form of aspirations for a Palestinian state.

Founded in 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization is an umbrella organization for groups that represent the Palestinian people before international states. The Palestinian National Authority, officially established in 1994 as a result of the Oslo Accords, is an interim administrative body nominally responsible for governance in Palestinian population centres in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Since 1978, the United Nations has observed an annual International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. According to British historian Perry Anderson, it is estimated that half of the population in the Palestinian territories are refugees, and that they have collectively suffered approximately US$300 billion in property losses due to Israeli confiscations, at 2008–2009 prices.

Despite various wars and exoduses, roughly one half of the world&#x27;s Palestinian population continues to reside in the territory of former Mandatory Palestine, now encompassing Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In Israel proper, Palestinians constitute almost 21 percent of the population as part of its Arab citizens. Many are Palestinian refugees or internally displaced Palestinians, including over 1.4 million in the Gaza Strip, over 870,000 in the West Bank, and around 250,000 in Israel proper. Of the Palestinian population who live abroad, known as the Palestinian diaspora, more than half are stateless, lacking legal citizenship in any country. 2.3 million of the diaspora population are registered as refugees in neighboring Jordan, most of whom hold Jordanian citizenship; over 1 million live between Syria and Lebanon, and about 750,000 live in Saudi Arabia, with Chile holding the largest Palestinian diaspora concentration (around half a million) outside of the Arab world.

==Etymology==

The Greek toponym &quot;Palaistínē&quot; (Παλαιστίνη), which is the origin of the Arabic &quot;Filasṭīn&quot; (فلسطين), first occurs in the work of the 5th century BCE Greek historian Herodotus, where it denotes generally the coastal land from Phoenicia down to Egypt. Herodotus also employs the term as an ethnonym, as when he speaks of the &quot;Syrians of Palestine&quot; or &quot;Palestinian-Syrians&quot;, an ethnically amorphous group he distinguishes from the Phoenicians. Herodotus makes no distinction between the inhabitants of Palestine.

The Greek word reflects an ancient Eastern Mediterranean-Near Eastern word which was used either as a toponym or ethnonym. In Ancient Egyptian &quot;Peleset/Purusati&quot; has been conjectured to refer to the &quot;Sea Peoples&quot;, particularly the Philistines. Among Semitic languages, Akkadian &quot;Palaštu&quot; (variant &quot;Pilištu&quot;) is used of 7th-century Philistia and its, by then, four city states. Biblical Hebrew&#x27;s cognate word &quot;Plištim&quot;, is usually translated Philistines.

When the Romans conquered the region in the first century BCE, they used the name Judaea for the province that covered most of the region. At the same time, the name &quot;Syria Palestina&quot; continued to be used by historians and geographers to refer to the area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, as in the writings of Philo, Josephus and Pliny the Elder. During the early 2nd century CE, Syria Palaestina became the official administrative name in a move viewed by scholars as an attempt by emperor Hadrian to disassociate Jews from the land as punishment for the Bar Kokhba revolt. Jacobson suggested the change to be rationalized by the fact that the new province was far larger. The name was thenceforth inscribed on coins, and beginning in the fifth century, mentioned in rabbinic texts. The Arabic word &quot;Filastin&quot; has been used to refer to the region since the time of the earliest medieval Arab geographers. It appears to have been used as an Arabic adjectival noun in the region since as early as the 7th century.

In modern times, the first person to self-describe Palestine&#x27;s Arabs as &quot;Palestinians&quot; was Khalil Beidas in 1898, followed by Salim Quba&#x27;in and Najib Nassar in 1902. After the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, which eased press censorship laws in the Ottoman Empire, dozens of newspapers and periodicals were founded in Palestine, and the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; expanded in usage. Among those were the &quot;Al-Quds&quot;, &quot;Al-Munadi&quot;, &quot;Falastin&quot;, &quot;Al-Karmil&quot; and Al-Nafir newspapers, which used the term &quot;Filastini&quot; more than 170 times in 110 articles from 1908 to 1914. They also made references to a &quot;Palestinian society&quot;, &quot;Palestinian nation&quot;, and a &quot;Palestinian diaspora&quot;. Article writers included Christian and Muslim Arab Palestinians, Palestinian emigrants, and non-Palestinian Arabs. The Palestinian Arab Christian Falastin newspaper had addressed its readers as Palestinians since its inception in 1911 during the Ottoman period.

During the Mandatory Palestine period, the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; was used to refer to all people residing there, regardless of religion or ethnicity, and those granted citizenship by the British Mandatory authorities were granted &quot;Palestinian citizenship&quot;. Other examples include the use of the term Palestine Regiment to refer to the Jewish Infantry Brigade Group of the British Army during World War II, and the term &quot;Palestinian Talmud&quot;, which is an alternative name of the Jerusalem Talmud, used mainly in academic sources.

Following the 1948 establishment of Israel, the use and application of the terms &quot;Palestine&quot; and &quot;Palestinian&quot; by and to Palestinian Jews largely dropped from use. For example, the English-language newspaper &quot;The Palestine Post&quot;, founded by Jews in 1932, changed its name in 1950 to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;. The term Arab Jews can include Jews with Palestinian heritage and Israeli citizenship, although some Arab Jews prefer to be called Mizrahi Jews. Non-Jewish Arab citizens of Israel with Palestinian heritage identify themselves as Arabs or Palestinians. These non-Jewish Arab Israelis thus include those that are Palestinian by heritage but Israeli by citizenship.

The Palestinian National Charter, as amended by the PLO&#x27;s Palestinian National Council in July 1968, defined &quot;Palestinians&quot; as &quot;those Arab nationals who, until 1947, normally resided in Palestine regardless of whether they were evicted from it or stayed there. Anyone born, after that date, of a Palestinian father – whether in Palestine or outside it – is also a Palestinian.&quot; Note that &quot;Arab nationals&quot; is &quot;not&quot; religious-specific, and it includes not only the Arabic-speaking Muslims of Palestine but also the Arab Christians and other religious communities of Palestine who were at that time Arabic-speakers, such as the Samaritans and Druze. Thus, the Jews of Palestine were/are also included, although limited only to &quot;the [Arabic-speaking] Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the beginning of the [pre-state] Zionist invasion.&quot; The Charter also states that &quot;Palestine with the boundaries it had during the British Mandate, is an indivisible territorial unit.&quot;

==Origins==
Historical records and later genetic studies indicate that the Palestinian people descend mostly from Ancient Levantines extending back to Bronze Age inhabitants of Levant. According to Palestinian historian Nazmi Al-Ju&#x27;beh like in other Arab nations, the Arab identity of Palestinians, largely based on linguistic and cultural affiliation, is independent of the existence of any actual Arabian origins. Palestinians are sometimes described as indigenous. In a human rights context, the word &quot;indigenous&quot; may have different definitions; the UN Commission on Human Rights uses several criteria to define this term.
Palestine has undergone many demographic and religious upheavals throughout history. During the 2nd millennium BCE, it was inhabited by the Canaanites, Semitic-speaking peoples who practiced the Canaanite religion. Most Palestinians share a strong genetic link to the ancient Canaanites. Israelites later emerged as an outgrowth of southern Canaanite civilization, with Jews and Israelite Samaritans eventually forming the majority of the population in Palestine during classical antiquity, However, the Jewish population in Jerusalem and its surroundings in Judea, and Samaritan population in Samaria, never fully recovered as a result of the Jewish-Roman Wars and Samaritan revolts respectively.

In the centuries that followed, the region experienced political and economic unrest, mass conversions to Christianity (and subsequent Christianization of the Roman Empire), and the religious persecution of minorities. The immigration of Christians, the emigration of Jews, and the conversion of pagans, Jews and Samaritans, contributed to a Christian majority forming in Late Roman and Byzantine Palestine.

In the 7th century, the Arab Rashiduns conquered the Levant; they were later succeeded by other Arab Muslim dynasties, including the Umayyads, Abbasids and the Fatimids. Over the following several centuries, the population of Palestine drastically decreased, from an estimated 1 million during the Roman and Byzantine periods to about 300,000 by the early Ottoman period. Over time, the existing population adopted Arab culture and language and much converted to Islam. The settlement of Arabs before and after the Muslim conquest is thought to have played a role in accelerating the Islamization process. Some scholars suggest that by the arrival of the Crusaders, Palestine was already overwhelmingly Muslim, while others claim that it was only after the Crusades that the Christians lost their majority, and that the process of mass Islamization took place much later, perhaps during the Mamluk period.

For several centuries during the Ottoman period the population in Palestine declined and fluctuated between 150,000 and 250,000 inhabitants, and it was only in the 19th century that a rapid population growth began to occur. This growth was aided by the immigration of Egyptians (during the reigns of Muhammad Ali and Ibrahim Pasha) and Algerians (following Abdelkader El Djezaïri&#x27;s revolt) in the first half of the 19th century, and the subsequent immigration of Algerians, Bosnians, and Circassians during the second half of the century. Between 1871 and 1945, around a dozen villages were established by immigrants.

Many Palestinian villagers claim ancestral ties to Arab tribes from the Arabian Peninsula that settled in Palestine during or after the Muslim conquest of the Levant. Some Palestinian families, notably in the Hebron and Nablus regions, claim Jewish and Samaritan ancestry respectively, preserving associated cultural customs and traditions.

==Genetics==

Early farming populations in the Levant, Iran, and Anatolia have significantly influenced modern-day Western Asian genomes. A 2020 study compared the genome-wide data of modern-day Palestinians and other populations in the Levant with various ancient population samples recovered from archaeological sites. It suggested that Palestinians, along with other modern-day populations in the Levant, have ancestry from Southern Levant populations from the Bronze and Iron Ages (associated with &quot;Canaanite&quot; culture), along with migrants from the Caucasus or Zagros area dating back to around 2500 to 1000 BCE.

Genetic studies indicate a genetic affinity between Palestinians and other Arab and Semitic groups in the Middle East and North Africa. A 2003 study, which looked into Mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome variations in African and West Asian populations, suggested that there are indications within Palestinian populations of maternal gene flow from Sub-Saharan Africa, possibly linked to historical migrations or the Arab slave trade. Genetic studies have also shown a genetic relationship between Palestinians and Jews. A 2023 study, which looked at the whole genomes of modern-day ethnic groups around the world, found that the Palestinian samples clustered in the &quot;Middle Eastern genomic group&quot;. This group included samples from populations such as Samaritans, Bedouins, Jordanians, Iraqi Jews and Yemenite Jews.

==Identity==

===Emergence of a distinct identity===

The timing and causes behind the emergence of a distinctively Palestinian national identity among the Arabs of Palestine are matters of scholarly disagreement. Some argue that it can be traced as far back as the peasants&#x27; revolt in Palestine in 1834 (or even as early as the 17th century), while others argue that it did not emerge until after the Mandatory Palestine period. Legal historian Assaf Likhovski states that the prevailing view is that Palestinian identity originated in the early decades of the 20th century, when an embryonic desire among Palestinians for self-government in the face of generalized fears that Zionism would lead to a Jewish state and the dispossession of the Arab majority crystallised among most editors, Christian and Muslim, of local newspapers. The term itself &quot;Filasṭīnī&quot; was first introduced by Khalīl Beidas in a translation of a Russian work on the Holy Land into Arabic in 1898. After that, its usage gradually spread so that, by 1908, with the loosening of censorship controls under late Ottoman rule, a number of Muslim, Christian and Jewish correspondents writing for newspapers began to use the term with great frequency in referring to the &#x27;Palestinian people&#x27; (&quot;ahl/ahālī Filasṭīn&quot;), &#x27;Palestinians&#x27; (&quot;al-Filasṭīnīyūn&quot;), the &#x27;sons of Palestine&#x27; (&quot;abnā’ Filasṭīn&quot;) or to &#x27;Palestinian society&#x27; (&quot;al-mujtama&#x27; al-filasṭīnī&quot;).
Whatever the differing viewpoints over the timing, causal mechanisms, and orientation of Palestinian nationalism, by the early 20th century strong opposition to Zionism and evidence of a burgeoning nationalistic Palestinian identity is found in the content of Arabic-language newspapers in Palestine, such as &quot;Al-Karmil&quot; (est. 1908) and &quot;Filasteen&quot; (est. 1911). Filasteen initially focused its critique of Zionism around the failure of the Ottoman administration to control Jewish immigration and the large influx of foreigners, later exploring the impact of Zionist land-purchases on Palestinian peasants (, &quot;fellahin&quot;), expressing growing concern over land dispossession and its implications for the society at large.

Historian Rashid Khalidi&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness&quot; is considered a &quot;foundational text&quot; on the subject. He notes that the archaeological strata that denote the history of Palestine – encompassing the Biblical, Roman, Byzantine, Umayyad, Abbasid, Fatimid, Crusader, Ayyubid, Mamluk and Ottoman periods – form part of the identity of the modern-day Palestinian people, as they have come to understand it over the last century. Noting that Palestinian identity has never been an exclusive one, with &quot;Arabism, religion, and local loyalties&quot; playing an important role, Khalidi cautions against the efforts of some extreme advocates of Palestinian nationalism to &quot;anachronistically&quot; read back into history a nationalist consciousness that is in fact &quot;relatively modern&quot;.

Khalidi argues that the modern national identity of Palestinians has its roots in nationalist discourses that emerged among the peoples of the Ottoman empire in the late 19th century that sharpened following the demarcation of modern nation-state boundaries in the Middle East after World War I. Khalidi also states that although the challenge posed by Zionism played a role in shaping this identity, that &quot;it is a serious mistake to suggest that Palestinian identity emerged mainly as a response to Zionism.&quot;

Conversely, historian James L. Gelvin argues that Palestinian nationalism was a direct reaction to Zionism. In his book &quot;The Israel-Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War&quot; he states that &quot;Palestinian nationalism emerged during the interwar period in response to Zionist immigration and settlement.&quot; Gelvin argues that this fact does not make the Palestinian identity any less legitimate: &quot;The fact that Palestinian nationalism developed later than Zionism and indeed in response to it does not in any way diminish the legitimacy of Palestinian nationalism or make it less valid than Zionism. All nationalisms arise in opposition to some &#x27;other.&#x27; Why else would there be the need to specify who you are? And all nationalisms are defined by what they oppose.&quot;

David Seddon writes that &quot;[t]he creation of Palestinian identity in its contemporary sense was formed essentially during the 1960s, with the creation of the Palestine Liberation Organization.&quot; He adds, however, that &quot;the existence of a population with a recognizably similar name (&#x27;the Philistines&#x27;) in Biblical times suggests a degree of continuity over a long historical period (much as &#x27;the Israelites&#x27; of the Bible suggest a long historical continuity in the same region).&quot;

Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal consider the 1834 Peasants&#x27; revolt in Palestine as constituting the first formative event of the Palestinian people. From 1516 to 1917, Palestine was ruled by the Ottoman Empire save a decade from the 1830s to the 1840s when an Egyptian vassal of the Ottomans, Muhammad Ali, and his son Ibrahim Pasha successfully broke away from Ottoman leadership and, conquering territory spreading from Egypt to as far north as Damascus, asserted their own rule over the area. The so-called Peasants&#x27; Revolt by Palestine&#x27;s Arabs was precipitated by heavy demands for conscripts. The local leaders and urban notables were unhappy about the loss of traditional privileges, while the peasants were well aware that conscription was little more than a death sentence. Starting in May 1834 the rebels took many cities, among them Jerusalem, Hebron and Nablus and Ibrahim Pasha&#x27;s army was deployed, defeating the last rebels on 4 August in Hebron. Benny Morris argues that the Arabs in Palestine nevertheless remained part of a larger national pan-Arab or, alternatively, pan-Islamist movement. Walid Khalidi argues otherwise, writing that Palestinians in Ottoman times were &quot;[a]cutely aware of the distinctiveness of Palestinian history ...&quot; and &quot;[a]lthough proud of their Arab heritage and ancestry, the Palestinians considered themselves to be descended not only from Arab conquerors of the seventh century but also from indigenous peoples who had lived in the country since time immemorial, including the ancient Hebrews and the Canaanites before them.&quot;

Zachary J. Foster argued in a 2015 &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article that &quot;based on hundreds of manuscripts, Islamic court records, books, magazines, and newspapers from the Ottoman period (1516–1918), it seems that the first Arab to use the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; was Farid Georges Kassab, a Beirut-based Orthodox Christian.&quot; He explained further that Kassab&#x27;s 1909 book &quot;Palestine, Hellenism, and Clericalism&quot; noted in passing that &quot;the Orthodox Palestinian Ottomans call themselves Arabs, and are in fact Arabs,&quot; despite describing the Arabic speakers of Palestine as Palestinians throughout the rest of the book.&quot;

Bernard Lewis argues it was not as a Palestinian nation that the Arabs of Ottoman Palestine objected to Zionists, since the very concept of such a nation was unknown to the Arabs of the area at the time and did not come into being until very much later. Even the concept of Arab nationalism in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire, &quot;had not reached significant proportions before the outbreak of World War I.&quot; Tamir Sorek, a sociologist, submits that, &quot;Although a distinct Palestinian identity can be traced back at least to the middle of the nineteenth century (Kimmerling and Migdal 1993; Khalidi 1997b), or even to the seventeenth century (Gerber 1998), it was not until after World War I that a broad range of optional &quot;political&quot; affiliations became relevant for the Arabs of Palestine.&quot;

Israeli historian Efraim Karsh takes the view that the Palestinian identity did not develop until after the 1967 war because the Palestinian exodus/expulsion had fractured society so greatly that it was impossible to piece together a national identity. Between 1948 and 1967, the Jordanians and other Arab countries hosting Arab refugees from Palestine/Israel silenced any expression of Palestinian identity and occupied their lands until Israel&#x27;s conquests of 1967. The formal annexation of the West Bank by Jordan in 1950, and the subsequent granting of its Palestinian residents Jordanian citizenship, further stunted the growth of a Palestinian national identity by integrating them into Jordanian society.

The idea of a unique Palestinian state distinct from its Arab neighbors was at first rejected by Palestinian representatives. The First Congress of Muslim-Christian Associations (in Jerusalem, February 1919), which met for the purpose of selecting a Palestinian Arab representative for the Paris Peace Conference, adopted the following resolution: &quot;We consider Palestine as part of Arab Syria, as it has never been separated from it at any time. We are connected with it by national, religious, linguistic, natural, economic and geographical bonds.&quot;

==Rise of Palestinian nationalism==
An independent Palestinian state has not exercised full sovereignty over the land in which the Palestinians have lived during the modern era. Palestine was administered by the Ottoman Empire until World War I, and then overseen by the British Mandatory authorities. Israel was established in parts of Palestine in 1948, and in the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank was ruled by Jordan, and the Gaza Strip by Egypt, with both countries continuing to administer these areas until Israel occupied them in the Six-Day War. Historian Avi Shlaim states that the Palestinians&#x27; lack of sovereignty over the land has been used by Israelis to deny Palestinians their rights
to self-determination.

Today, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination has been affirmed by the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of Justice and several Israeli authorities. A total of 133 countries recognize Palestine as a state. However, Palestinian sovereignty over the areas claimed as part of the Palestinian state remains limited, and the boundaries of the state remain a point of contestation between Palestinians and Israelis.

===British Mandate (1917–1947)===
The first Palestinian nationalist organizations emerged at the end of the World War I. Two political factions emerged. &quot;al-Muntada al-Adabi&quot;, dominated by the Nashashibi family, militated for the promotion of the Arabic language and culture, for the defense of Islamic values and for an independent Syria and Palestine. In Damascus, &quot;al-Nadi al-Arabi&quot;, dominated by the Husayni family, defended the same values.

Article 22 of The Covenant of the League of Nations conferred an international legal status upon the territories and people which had ceased to be under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire as part of a &#x27;sacred trust of civilization&#x27;. Article 7 of the League of Nations Mandate required the establishment of a new, separate, Palestinian nationality for the inhabitants. This meant that Palestinians did not become British citizens, and that Palestine was not annexed into the British dominions. The Mandate document divided the population into Jewish and non-Jewish, and Britain, the Mandatory Power considered the Palestinian population to be composed of religious, not national, groups. Consequently, government censuses in 1922 and 1931 would categorize Palestinians confessionally as Muslims, Christians and Jews, with the category of Arab absent.

The articles of the Mandate mentioned the civil and religious rights of the non-Jewish communities in Palestine, but not their political status. At the San Remo conference, it was decided to accept the text of those articles, while inserting in the minutes of the conference an undertaking by the Mandatory Power that this would not involve the surrender of any of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine. In 1922, the British authorities over Mandatory Palestine proposed a draft constitution that would have granted the Palestinian Arabs representation in a Legislative Council on condition that they accept the terms of the mandate. The Palestine Arab delegation rejected the proposal as &quot;wholly unsatisfactory&quot;, noting that &quot;the People of Palestine&quot; could not accept the inclusion of the Balfour Declaration in the constitution&#x27;s preamble as the basis for discussions. They further took issue with the designation of Palestine as a British &quot;colony of the lowest order.&quot; The Arabs tried to get the British to offer an Arab legal establishment again roughly ten years later, but to no avail.

After the British general, Louis Bols, read out the Balfour Declaration in February 1920, some 1,500 Palestinians demonstrated in the streets of Jerusalem.

A month later, during the 1920 Nebi Musa riots, the protests against British rule and Jewish immigration became violent and Bols banned all demonstrations. In May 1921 however, further anti-Jewish riots broke out in Jaffa and dozens of Arabs and Jews were killed in the confrontations.

After the 1920 Nebi Musa riots, the San Remo conference and the failure of Faisal to establish the Kingdom of Greater Syria, a distinctive form of Palestinian Arab nationalism took root between April and July 1920. With the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the French conquest of Syria, coupled with the British conquest and administration of Palestine, the formerly pan-Syrianist mayor of Jerusalem, Musa Qasim Pasha al-Husayni, said &quot;Now, after the recent events in Damascus, we have to effect a complete change in our plans here. Southern Syria no longer exists. We must defend Palestine&quot;.

Conflict between Palestinian nationalists and various types of pan-Arabists continued during the British Mandate, but the latter became increasingly marginalized. Two prominent leaders of the Palestinian nationalists were Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, appointed by the British, and Izz ad-Din al-Qassam. After the killing of sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam by the British in 1935, his followers initiated the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, which began with a general strike in Jaffa and attacks on Jewish and British installations in Nablus. The Arab Higher Committee called for a nationwide general strike, non-payment of taxes, and the closure of municipal governments, and demanded an end to Jewish immigration and a ban of the sale of land to Jews. By the end of 1936, the movement had become a national revolt, and resistance grew during 1937 and 1938. In response, the British declared martial law, dissolved the Arab High Committee and arrested officials from the Supreme Muslim Council who were behind the revolt. By 1939, 5,000 Arabs had been killed in British attempts to quash the revolt; more than 15,000 were wounded.

===War (1947–1949)===
In November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Partition Plan, which divided the mandate of Palestine into two states: one majority Arab and one majority Jewish. The Palestinian Arabs rejected the plan and attacked Jewish civilian areas and paramilitary targets. Following Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence in May 1948, five Arab armies (Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Transjordan) came to the Palestinian Arabs&#x27; aid against the newly founded State of Israel.

The Palestinian Arabs suffered such a major defeat at the end of the war, that the term they use to describe the war is Nakba (the &quot;catastrophe&quot;). Israel took control of much of the territory that would have been allocated to the Arab state had the Palestinian Arabs accepted the UN partition plan. Along with a military defeat, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from what became the State of Israel. Israel did not allow the Palestinian refugees of the war to return to Israel.

===&quot;Lost years&quot; (1949–1967)===

After the war, there was a hiatus in Palestinian political activity. Khalidi attributes this to the traumatic events of 1947–49, which included the depopulation of over 400 towns and villages and the creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees. 418 villages had been razed, 46,367 buildings, 123 schools, 1,233 mosques, 8 churches and 68 holy shrines, many with a long history, destroyed by Israeli forces. In addition, Palestinians lost from 1.5 to 2 million acres of land, an estimated 150,000 urban and rural homes, and 23,000 commercial structures such as shops and offices. Recent estimates of the cost to Palestinians in property confiscations by Israel from 1948 onwards has concluded that Palestinians have suffered a net $300 billion loss in assets.

Those parts of British Mandatory Palestine which did not become part of the newly declared Israeli state were occupied by Egypt or annexed by Jordan. At the Jericho Conference on 1 December 1948, 2,000 Palestinian delegates supported a resolution calling for &quot;the unification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full Arab unity&quot;. During what Khalidi terms the &quot;lost years&quot; that followed, Palestinians lacked a center of gravity, divided as they were between these countries and others such as Syria, Lebanon, and elsewhere.

In the 1950s, a new generation of Palestinian nationalist groups and movements began to organize clandestinely, stepping out onto the public stage in the 1960s. The traditional Palestinian elite who had dominated negotiations with the British and the Zionists in the Mandate, and who were largely held responsible for the loss of Palestine, were replaced by these new movements whose recruits generally came from poor to middle-class backgrounds and were often students or recent graduates of universities in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus. The potency of the pan-Arabist ideology put forward by Gamal Abdel Nasser—popular among Palestinians for whom Arabism was already an important component of their identity—tended to obscure the identities of the separate Arab states it subsumed.

===1967–present===

Since 1967, Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have lived under military occupation, creating, according to Avram Bornstein, a carceralization of their society. In the meantime, pan-Arabism has waned as an aspect of Palestinian identity. The Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank triggered a second Palestinian exodus and fractured Palestinian political and militant groups, prompting them to give up residual hopes in pan-Arabism. They rallied increasingly around the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had been formed in Cairo in 1964. The group grew in popularity in the following years, especially under the nationalistic orientation of the leadership of Yasser Arafat. Mainstream secular Palestinian nationalism was grouped together under the umbrella of the PLO whose constituent organizations include Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, among other groups who at that time believed that political violence was the only way to &quot;liberate&quot; Palestine. These groups gave voice to a tradition that emerged in the 1960s that argues Palestinian nationalism has deep historical roots, with extreme advocates reading a Palestinian nationalist consciousness and identity back into the history of Palestine over the past few centuries, and even millennia, when such a consciousness is in fact relatively modern.The Battle of Karameh and the events of Black September in Jordan contributed to growing Palestinian support for these groups, particularly among Palestinians in exile. Concurrently, among Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a new ideological theme, known as &quot;sumud&quot;, represented the Palestinian political strategy popularly adopted from 1967 onward. As a concept closely related to the land, agriculture and indigenousness, the ideal image of the Palestinian put forward at this time was that of the peasant (in Arabic, &quot;fellah&quot;) who stayed put on his land, refusing to leave. A strategy more passive than that adopted by the Palestinian fedayeen, &quot;sumud&quot; provided an important subtext to the narrative of the fighters, &quot;in symbolizing continuity and connections with the land, with peasantry and a rural way of life.&quot;

In 1974, the PLO was recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people by the Arab nation-states and was granted observer status as a national liberation movement by the United Nations that same year. Israel rejected the resolution, calling it &quot;shameful&quot;. In a speech to the Knesset, Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Yigal Allon outlined the government&#x27;s view that: &quot;No one can expect us to recognize the terrorist organization called the PLO as representing the Palestinians—because it does not. No one can expect us to negotiate with the heads of terror-gangs, who through their ideology and actions, endeavor to liquidate the State of Israel.&quot;

In 1975, the United Nations established a subsidiary organ, the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, to recommend a program of implementation to enable the Palestinian people to exercise national independence and their rights to self-determination without external interference, national independence and sovereignty, and to return to their homes and property.

The First Intifada (1987–93) was the first popular uprising against the Israeli occupation of 1967. Followed by the PLO&#x27;s 1988 proclamation of a State of Palestine, these developments served to further reinforce the Palestinian national identity. After the Gulf War in 1991, Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait. The policy which partly led to this exodus was a response to the alignment of PLO leader Yasser Arafat with Saddam Hussein.

The Oslo Accords, the first Israeli–Palestinian interim peace agreement, were signed in 1993. The process was envisioned to last five years, ending in June 1999, when the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area began. The expiration of this term without the recognition by Israel of the Palestinian State and without the effective termination of the occupation was followed by the Second Intifada in 2000. The second intifada was more violent than the first. The International Court of Justice observed that since the government of Israel had decided to recognize the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people, their existence was no longer an issue. The court noted that the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 28 September 1995 also referred a number of times to the Palestinian people and its &quot;legitimate rights&quot;. According to Thomas Giegerich, with respect to the Palestinian people&#x27;s right to form a sovereign independent state, &quot;The right of self-determination gives the Palestinian people collectively the inalienable right freely to determine its political status, while Israel, having recognized the Palestinians as a separate people, is obliged to promote and respect this right in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations&quot;.

Following the failures of the Second Intifada, a younger generation is emerging that cares less about nationalist ideology than about economic growth. This has been a source of tension between some of the Palestinian political leadership and Palestinian business professionals who desire economic cooperation with Israelis. At an international conference in Bahrain, Palestinian businessman Ashraf Jabari said, &quot;I have no problem working with Israel. It is time to move on. ... The Palestinian Authority does not want peace. They told the families of the businessmen that they are wanted [by police] for participating in the Bahrain workshop.&quot;

==Demographics==

In the absence of a comprehensive census including all Palestinian diaspora populations, and those that have remained within what was British Mandate Palestine, exact population figures are difficult to determine. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) announced at the end of 2015 that the number of Palestinians worldwide at the end of 2015 was 12.37 million of which the number still residing within historic Palestine was 6.22 million. In 2022, Arnon Soffer estimated that in the territory of former Mandatory Palestine (now encompassing Israel and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip), there&#x27;s a Palestinian population of 7.503 million, making up 51.16% of the total population. Within Israel proper, Palestinians constitute almost 21 percent of the population as part of its Arab citizens.

In 2005, a critical review of the PCBS figures and methodology was conducted by the American-Israel Demographic Research Group (AIDRG). In their report, they claimed that several errors in the PCBS methodology and assumptions artificially inflated the numbers by a total of 1.3 million. The PCBS numbers were cross-checked against a variety of other sources (e.g., asserted birth rates based on fertility rate assumptions for a given year were checked against Palestinian Ministry of Health figures as well as Ministry of Education school enrollment figures six years later; immigration numbers were checked against numbers collected at border crossings, etc.). The errors claimed in their analysis included: birth rate errors (308,000), immigration &amp; emigration errors (310,000), failure to account for migration to Israel (105,000), double-counting Jerusalem Arabs (210,000), counting former residents now living abroad (325,000) and other discrepancies (82,000). The results of their research was also presented before the United States House of Representatives on 8 March 2006.

The study was criticised by Sergio DellaPergola, a demographer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. DellaPergola accused the authors of the AIDRG report of misunderstanding basic principles of demography on account of their lack of expertise in the subject, but he also acknowledged that he did not take into account the emigration of Palestinians and thinks it has to be examined, as well as the birth and mortality statistics of the Palestinian Authority.
He also accused AIDRG of selective use of data and multiple systematic errors in their analysis, claiming that the authors assumed the Palestinian Electoral registry to be complete even though registration is voluntary, and they used an unrealistically low Total Fertility Ratio (a statistical abstraction of births per woman) to reanalyse that data in a &quot;typical circular mistake.&quot; DellaPergola estimated the Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza at the end of 2005 as 3.33 million, or 3.57 million if East Jerusalem is included. These figures are only slightly lower than the official Palestinian figures. The Israeli Civil Administration put the number of Palestinians in the West Bank at 2,657,029 as of May 2012.

The AIDRG study was also criticized by Ian Lustick, who accused its authors of multiple methodological errors and a political agenda.

In 2009, at the request of the PLO, &quot;Jordan revoked the citizenship of thousands of Palestinians to keep them from remaining permanently in the country.&quot;

Many Palestinians have settled in the United States, particularly in the Chicago area.

In total, an estimated 600,000 Palestinians are thought to reside in the Americas. Palestinian emigration to South America began for economic reasons that pre-dated the Arab-Israeli conflict, but continued to grow thereafter. Many emigrants were from the Bethlehem area. Those emigrating to Latin America were mainly Christian. Half of those of Palestinian origin in Latin America live in Chile, El Salvador and Honduras also have substantial Palestinian populations. These two countries have had presidents of Palestinian ancestry (Antonio Saca in El Salvador and Carlos Roberto Flores in Honduras). Belize, which has a smaller Palestinian population, has a Palestinian minister – Said Musa. Schafik Jorge Handal, Salvadoran politician and former guerrilla leader, was the son of Palestinian immigrants.

===Refugees===

In 2006, there were 4,255,120 Palestinians registered as refugees with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). This number includes the descendants of refugees who fled or were expelled during the 1948 war, but excludes those who have since then emigrated to areas outside of UNRWA&#x27;s remit. Based on these figures, almost half of all Palestinians are registered refugees. The 993,818 Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip and 705,207 Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, who hail from towns and villages now located within the borders of Israel, are included in these figures.UNRWA figures do not include some 274,000 people, or 1 in 5.5 of all Arab residents of Israel, who are internally displaced Palestinian refugees.

Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and the West Bank are organized according to a refugee family&#x27;s village or place of origin. Among the first things that children born in the camps learn is the name of their village of origin. David McDowall writes that, &quot;[...] a yearning for Palestine permeates the whole refugee community and is most ardently espoused by the younger refugees, for whom home exists only in the imagination.&quot;

Israeli policy to prevent the refugees from returning to their homes was initially formulated by David Ben Gurion and Joseph Weitz, director of the Jewish National Fund was formally adopted by the Israeli cabinet in June 1948. In December of that year the UN adopted resolution 194, which resolved &quot;that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible.&quot; Despite much of the international community, including the US President Harry Truman, insisting that the repatriation of Palestinian refugees was essential, Israel refused to accept the principle. In the intervening years Israel has consistently refused to change its position and has introduced further legislation to hinder Palestinians refugees from returning and reclaiming their land and confiscated property.

In keeping with an Arab League resolution in 1965, most Arab countries have refused to grant citizenship to Palestinians, arguing that it would be a threat to their right of return to their homes in Palestine. In 2012, Egypt deviated from this practice by granting citizenship to 50,000 Palestinians, mostly from the Gaza Strip.

Palestinians living in Lebanon are deprived of basic civil rights. They cannot own homes or land and are barred from becoming lawyers, engineers and doctors.

===Religion===
The majority of Palestinians are Muslim, the vast majority of whom are followers of the Sunni branch of Islam, with a small minority of Ahmadiyya. Palestinian Christians represent a significant minority of 6%, and belong to several denominations, followed by much smaller religious communities, including Druze and Samaritans. Palestinian Jews – considered Palestinian by the Palestinian National Charter adopted by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) which defined them as those &quot;Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the beginning of the Zionist invasion&quot; – today identify as Israelis (with the exception of a very few individuals). Palestinian Jews almost universally abandoned any such identity after the establishment of Israel and their incorporation into the Israeli Jewish population, which was originally composed of Jewish immigrants from around the world.Until the end of the 19th century, cross-cultural syncretism between Islamic and Christian symbols and figures in religious practice was common in the Palestinian countryside, where most villages did not have local mosques or churches. Popular feast days, such as Thursday of the Dead, were celebrated by both Muslims and Christians and shared prophets and saints include Jonah, who is venerated in Halhul as both a Biblical and Islamic prophet, and St. George, who is known in Arabic as al-Khdir. Villagers would pay tribute to local patron saints at maqams – domed single rooms often placed in the shadow of an ancient carob or oak tree; many of them are rooted in Jewish, Samaritan, Christian and sometimes pagan traditions. Saints, taboo by the standards of orthodox Islam, mediated between man and God, and shrines to saints and holy men dotted the Palestinian landscape. Ali Qleibo, a Palestinian anthropologist, states that this built evidence constitutes &quot;an architectural testimony to Christian/Moslem Palestinian religious sensibility and its roots in ancient Semitic religions.&quot;

Religion as constitutive of individual identity was accorded a minor role within Palestinian social structure until the latter half of the 19th century. Jean Moretain, a priest writing in 1848, wrote that a Christian in Palestine was &quot;distinguished only by the fact that he belonged to a particular clan. If a certain tribe was Christian, then an individual would be Christian, but without knowledge of what distinguished his faith from that of a Muslim.&quot;

The concessions granted to France and other Western powers by the Ottoman Sultanate in the aftermath of the Crimean War had a significant impact on contemporary Palestinian religious cultural identity. Religion was transformed into an element &quot;constituting the individual/collective identity in conformity with orthodox precepts&quot;, and formed a major building block in the political development of Palestinian nationalism.

The British census of 1922 registered 752,048 inhabitants in Palestine, consisting of 660,641 Palestinian Arabs (Muslim and Christian Arabs), 83,790 Palestinian Jews, and 7,617 persons belonging to other groups. The corresponding percentage breakdown is 87% Muslim and Christian Arab and 11% Jewish.
Bernard Sabella of Bethlehem University estimates that 6% of the Palestinian population worldwide is Christian and that 56% of them live outside of historic Palestine. According to the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs, the Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is 97% Muslim and 3% Christian. The vast majority of the Palestinian community in Chile follow Christianity, largely Eastern Orthodox and some Roman Catholic, and in fact the number of Palestinian Christians in the diaspora in Chile alone exceeds the number of those who have remained in their homeland. Saint George is the patron saint of the Palestinian Christians.

The Druze became Israeli citizens and Druze males serve in the Israel Defense Forces, though some individuals identify as &quot;Palestinian Druze&quot;. According to Salih al-Shaykh, most Druze do not consider themselves to be Palestinian: &quot;their Arab identity emanates in the main from the common language and their socio-cultural background, but is detached from any national political conception. It is not directed at Arab countries or Arab nationality or the Palestinian people, and does not express sharing any fate with them. From this point of view, their identity is Israel, and this identity is stronger than their Arab identity&quot;.

There are also about 350 Samaritans who carry Palestinian identity cards and live in the West Bank while a roughly equal number live in Holon and carry Israeli citizenship. Those who live in the West Bank also are represented in the legislature for the Palestinian National Authority. They are commonly referred to among Palestinians as the &quot;Jews of Palestine&quot;, and maintain their own unique cultural identity.

Jews who identify as Palestinian Jews are few, but include Israeli Jews who are part of the Neturei Karta group, and Uri Davis, an Israeli citizen and self-described Palestinian Jew (who converted to Islam in 2008 in order to marry Miyassar Abu Ali) who serves as an observer member in the Palestine National Council.

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, founder of the Baháʼí Faith spent his last years in Acre, then part of the Ottoman Empire. He remained there for 24 years, where a shrine was erected in his honor.

===Current demographics===
According to the PCBS, there are an estimated 4,816,503 Palestinians in the Palestinian territories , of whom 2,935,368 live in the West Bank and 1,881,135 in the Gaza Strip. According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, there were 1,658,000 Arab citizens of Israel as of 2013. Both figures include Palestinians in East Jerusalem.

In 2008, Minority Rights Group International estimated the number of Palestinians in Jordan to be about 3 million. The UNRWA put their number at 2.3 million .

==Society==
===Language===

Palestinian Arabic is a subgroup of the broader Levantine Arabic dialect. Prior to the 7th century Islamic Conquest and Arabization of the Levant, the primary languages spoken in Palestine, among the predominantly Christian and Jewish communities, were Aramaic, Greek, and Syriac. Arabic was also spoken in some areas. Palestinian Arabic, like other variations of the Levantine dialect, exhibits substantial influences in lexicon from Aramaic.

Palestinian Arabic has three primary sub-variations, Rural, Urban, and Bedouin, with the pronunciation of the &quot;Qāf&quot; serving as a shibboleth to distinguish between the three main Palestinian sub-dialects: The urban variety notes a [Q] sound, while the rural variety (spoken in the villages around major cities) have a [K] for the [Q]. The Bedouin variety of Palestine (spoken mainly in the southern region and along the Jordan valley) use a [G] instead of [Q].

Barbara McKean Parmenter has noted that the Arabs of Palestine have been credited with the preservation of the original Semitic place names of many sites mentioned in the Bible, as was documented by the American geographer Edward Robinson in the 19th century.

Palestinians who live or work in Israel generally can also speak Modern Hebrew, as do some who live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

===Education===

The literacy rate of Palestine was 96.3% according to a 2014 report by the United Nations Development Programme, which is high by international standards. There is a gender difference in the population aged above 15 with 5.9% of women considered illiterate compared to 1.6% of men. Illiteracy among women has fallen from 20.3% in 1997 to less than 6% in 2014.

Palestinian intellectuals, among them May Ziadeh and Khalil Beidas, were an integral part of the Arab intelligentsia. Educational levels among Palestinians have traditionally been high. In the 1960s the West Bank had a higher percentage of its adolescent population enrolled in high school education than did Lebanon. Claude Cheysson, France&#x27;s Minister for Foreign Affairs under the first Mitterrand Presidency, held in the mid-eighties that, &#x27;even thirty years ago, (Palestinians) probably already had the largest educated elite of all the Arab peoples.&#x27;

Contributions to Palestinian culture have been made by diaspora figures including Edward Said and Ghada Karmi, Arab citizens of Israel including Emile Habibi, and Jordanians including Ibrahim Nasrallah.

===Women and family===

In the 19th and early 20th century, there were some well known Palestinian families, which included the Khalidi family, the al-Husayni family, the Nashashibi family, the Tuqan family, the Nusaybah family, Qudwa family, Shawish clan, Shurrab family, Al-Zaghab family, Al-Khalil family, Ridwan dynasty, Al-Zeitawi family, Abu Ghosh clan, Barghouti family, Doghmush clan, Douaihy family, Hilles clan, Jarrar family, and the Jayyusi family. Since various conflicts with Zionists began, some of the communities have subsequently left Palestine. The role of women varies among Palestinians, with both progressive and ultra-conservative opinions existing. Other groups of Palestinians, such as the Negev Bedouins or Druze may no longer self-identify as Palestinian for political reasons.

==Culture==

Ali Qleibo, a Palestinian anthropologist, has critiqued Muslim historiography for assigning the beginning of Palestinian cultural identity to the advent of Islam in the 7th century. In describing the effect of such historiography, he writes: Pagan origins are disavowed. As such the peoples who populated Palestine throughout history have discursively rescinded their own history and religion as they adopted the religion, language, and culture of Islam. That the peasant culture of the large fellahin class showed features of cultures other than Islam was a conclusion arrived at by some Western scholars and explorers who mapped and surveyed Palestine during the latter half of the 19th century, and these ideas were to influence 20th-century debates on Palestinian identity by local and international ethnographers.
The contributions of the &#x27;nativist&#x27; ethnographies produced by Tawfiq Canaan and other Palestinian writers and published in &quot;The Journal of the Palestine Oriental Society&quot; (1920–48) were driven by the concern that the &quot;native culture of Palestine&quot;, and in particular peasant society, was being undermined by the forces of modernity. Salim Tamari writes that: Implicit in their scholarship (and made explicit by Canaan himself) was another theme, namely that the peasants of Palestine represent—through their folk norms ... the living heritage of all the accumulated ancient cultures that had appeared in Palestine (principally the Canaanite, Philistine, Hebraic, Nabatean, Syrio-Aramaic and Arab).
Palestinian culture is closely related to those of the nearby Levantine countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, and the Arab World. Cultural contributions to the fields of art, literature, music, costume and cuisine express the characteristics of the Palestinian experience and show signs of common origin despite the geographical separation between the Palestinian territories, Israel and the diaspora.

Al-Quds Capital of Arab Culture is an initiative undertaken by UNESCO under the Cultural Capitals Program to promote Arab culture and encourage cooperation in the Arab region. The opening event was launched in March 2009.

===Cuisine===
Palestine&#x27;s history of rule by many different empires is reflected in Palestinian cuisine, which has benefited from various cultural contributions and exchanges. Generally speaking, modern Syrian-Palestinian dishes have been influenced by the rule of three major Islamic groups: the Arabs, the Persian-influenced Arabs and the Turks. The Arabs who conquered Syria and Palestine had simple culinary traditions primarily based on the use of rice, lamb and yogurt, as well as dates. The already simple cuisine did not advance for centuries due to Islam&#x27;s strict rules of parsimony and restraint, until the rise of the Abbasids, who established Baghdad as their capital. Baghdad was historically located on Persian soil and henceforth, Persian culture was integrated into Arab culture during the 9th–11th centuries and spread throughout central areas of the empire.

There are several foods native to Palestine that are well known in the Arab world, such as, &quot;kinafe Nabulsi&quot;, Nabulsi cheese (cheese of Nablus), Ackawi cheese (cheese of Acre) and &quot;musakhan&quot;. &quot;Kinafe&quot; originated in Nablus, as well as the sweetened &quot;Nabulsi&quot; cheese used to fill it. Another very popular food is Palestinian Kofta or Kufta.

Mezze describes an assortment of dishes laid out on the table for a meal that takes place over several hours, a characteristic common to Mediterranean cultures. Some common mezze dishes are &quot;hummus&quot;, &quot;tabouleh&quot;,&quot;baba ghanoush&quot;, &quot;labaneh&quot;, and &quot;zate &#x27;u zaatar&quot;, which is the pita bread dipping of olive oil and ground thyme and sesame seeds.

Entrées that are eaten throughout the Palestinian territories, include &quot;waraq al-&#x27;inib&quot; – boiled grape leaves wrapped around cooked rice and ground lamb. &quot;Mahashi&quot; is an assortment of stuffed vegetables such as, zucchinis, potatoes, cabbage and in Gaza, chard.

===Art===
Similar to the structure of Palestinian society, the Palestinian field of arts extends over four main geographic centers: the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel, the Palestinian diaspora in the Arab world, and the Palestinian diaspora in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.

;Cinema

Palestinian cinematography, relatively young compared to Arab cinema overall, receives much European and Israeli support. Palestinian films are not exclusively produced in Arabic; some are made in English, French or Hebrew. More than 800 films have been produced about Palestinians, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and other related topics. Examples include &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; and &quot;Paradise Now&quot;.

;Handicrafts

A wide variety of handicrafts, many of which have been produced in the area of Palestine for hundreds of years, continue to be produced today. Palestinian handicrafts include embroidery and weaving, pottery-making, soap-making, glass-making, and olive-wood and Mother of Pearl carvings, among others.

;Traditional costumes

Foreign travelers to Palestine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries often commented on the rich variety of costumes among the area&#x27;s inhabitants, and particularly among the fellaheen or village women. Until the 1940s, a woman&#x27;s economic status, whether married or single, and the town or area they were from could be deciphered by most Palestinian women by the type of cloth, colors, cut, and embroidery motifs, or lack thereof, used for the robe-like dress or &quot;thoub&quot; in Arabic.

New styles began to appear in the 1960s. For example, the &quot;six-branched dress&quot; named after the six wide bands of embroidery running down from the waist. These styles came from the refugee camps, particularly after 1967. Individual village styles were lost and replaced by an identifiable &quot;Palestinian&quot; style. The shawal, a style popular in the West Bank and Jordan before the First Intifada, probably evolved from one of the many welfare embroidery projects in the refugee camps. It was a shorter and narrower fashion, with a western cut.
===Literature===


Palestinian literature forms part of the wider genre of Arabic literature. Unlike its Arabic counterparts, Palestinian literature is defined by national affiliation rather than territorially. For example, Egyptian literature is the literature produced in Egypt. This too was the case for Palestinian literature up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, but following the Palestinian Exodus of 1948 it has become &quot;a literature written by Palestinians&quot; regardless of their residential status.

Contemporary Palestinian literature is often characterized by its heightened sense of irony and the exploration of existential themes and issues of identity. References to the subjects of resistance to occupation, exile, loss, and love and longing for homeland are also common. Palestinian literature can be intensely political, as underlined by writers such as Salma Khadra Jayyusi and novelist Liana Badr, who have mentioned the need to give expression to the Palestinian &quot;collective identity&quot; and the &quot;just case&quot; of their struggle. There is also resistance to this school of thought, whereby Palestinian artists have &quot;rebelled&quot; against the demand that their art be &quot;committed&quot;. Poet Mourid Barghouti for example, has often said that &quot;poetry is not a civil servant, it&#x27;s not a soldier, it&#x27;s in nobody&#x27;s employ.&quot; Rula Jebreal&#x27;s novel &quot;Miral&quot; tells the story of Hind al-Husseini&#x27;s effort to establish an orphanage in Jerusalem after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Deir Yassin massacre, and the establishment of the state of Israel.

Since 1967, most critics have theorized the existence of three &quot;branches&quot; of Palestinian literature, loosely divided by geographic location: 1) from inside Israel, 2) from the occupied territories, 3) from among the Palestinian diaspora throughout the Middle East.

Hannah Amit-Kochavi recognizes only two branches: that written by Palestinians from inside the State of Israel as distinct from that written outside (ibid., p. 11). She also posits a temporal distinction between literature produced before 1948 and that produced thereafter. In a 2003 article published in &quot;Studies in the Humanities&quot;, Steven Salaita posits a fourth branch made up of English language works, particularly those written by Palestinians in the United States, which he defines as &quot;writing rooted in diasporic countries but focused in theme and content on Palestine.&quot;
Poetry, using classical pre-Islamic forms, remains an extremely popular art form, often attracting Palestinian audiences in the thousands. Until 20 years ago, local folk bards reciting traditional verses were a feature of every Palestinian town. After the 1948 Palestinian exodus and discrimination by neighboring Arab countries, poetry was transformed into a vehicle for political activism. From among those Palestinians who became Arab citizens of Israel after the passage of the Citizenship Law in 1952, a school of resistance poetry was born that included poets including Mahmoud Darwish, Samih al-Qasim, and Tawfiq Zayyad. The work of these poets was largely unknown to the wider Arab world for years because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab governments. The situation changed after Ghassan Kanafani, another Palestinian writer in exile in Lebanon, published an anthology of their work in 1966. Palestinian poets often write about the common theme of a strong affection and sense of loss and longing for a lost homeland. Among the new generation of Palestinian writers, the work of Nathalie Handal an award-winning poet, playwright, and editor has been widely published in literary journals and magazines and has been translated into twelve languages.
Palestinian folklore is the body of expressive culture, including tales, music, dance, legends, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, customs, and comprising the traditions (including oral traditions) of Palestinian culture. There was a folklorist revival among Palestinian intellectuals such as Nimr Sirhan, Musa Allush, Salim Mubayyid, and the Palestinian Folklore Society during the 1970s. This group attempted to establish pre-Islamic (and pre-Hebraic) cultural roots for a re-constructed Palestinian national identity. The two putative roots in this patrimony are Canaanite and Jebusite. Such efforts seem to have borne fruit as evidenced in the organization of celebrations including the Qabatiya Canaanite festival and the annual Music Festival of Yabus by the Palestinian Ministry of Culture.

Traditional storytelling among Palestinians is prefaced with an invitation to the listeners to give blessings to God and the Prophet Mohammed or the Virgin Mary as the case may be, and includes the traditional opening: &quot;There was, or there was not, in the oldness of time...&quot; Formulaic elements of the stories share much in common with the wider Arab world, though the rhyming scheme is distinct. There are a cast of supernatural characters: djinns who can cross the Seven Seas in an instant, giants, and ghouls with eyes of ember and teeth of brass. Stories invariably have a happy ending, and the storyteller will usually finish off with a rhyme like: &quot;The bird has taken flight, God bless you tonight&quot;, or &quot;Tutu, tutu, finished is my &quot;haduttu&quot; (story).&quot;

===Music===

Palestinian music is well known throughout the Arab world. After 1948, a new wave of performers emerged with distinctively Palestinian themes relating to dreams of statehood and burgeoning nationalist sentiments. In addition to &quot;zajal&quot; and &quot;ataaba&quot;, traditional Palestinian songs include: &quot;Bein Al-dawai&quot;, &quot;Al-Rozana&quot;, &quot;Zarif – Al-Toul&quot;, and &quot;Al-Maijana&quot;, &quot;Dal&#x27;ona&quot;, &quot;Sahja/Saamir&quot;, &quot;Zaghareet&quot;. Over three decades, the Palestinian National Music and Dance Troupe (El Funoun) and Mohsen Subhi have reinterpreted and rearranged traditional wedding songs such as &quot;Mish&#x27;al&quot; (1986), &quot;Marj Ibn &#x27;Amer&quot;(1989) and &quot;Zaghareed&quot; (1997). &quot;Ataaba&quot; is a form of folk singing that consists of four verses, following a specific form and meter. The distinguishing feature of ataaba is that the first three verses end with the same word meaning three different things, and the fourth verse serves as a conclusion. It is usually followed by a &quot;dalouna&quot;.

Reem Kelani is one of the foremost researchers and performers in the present day of music with a specifically Palestinian narrative and heritage. Her 2006 debut solo album &quot;Sprinting Gazelle – Palestinian Songs from the Motherland and the Diaspora&quot; comprised Kelani&#x27;s research and an arrangement of five traditional Palestinian songs, whilst the other five songs were her own musical settings of popular and resistance poetry by the likes of Mahmoud Darwish, Salma Khadra Jayyusi, Rashid Husain and Mahmoud Salim al-Hout. All the songs on the album relate to &#x27;pre-1948 Palestine&#x27;.

====Palestinian hip hop====

Palestinian hip hop reportedly started in 1998 with Tamer Nafar&#x27;s group DAM. These Palestinian youth forged the new Palestinian musical subgenre, which blends Arabic melodies and hip hop beats. Lyrics are often sung in Arabic, Hebrew, English, and sometimes French. Since then, the new Palestinian musical subgenre has grown to include artists in the Palestinian territories, Israel, Great Britain, the United States and Canada.Borrowing from traditional rap music that first emerged in New York in the 1970s, &quot;young Palestinian musicians have tailored the style to express their own grievances with the social and political climate in which they live and work.&quot; Palestinian hip hop works to challenge stereotypes and instigate dialogue about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Palestinian hip-hop artists have been strongly influenced by the messages of American rappers. Tamar Nafar says, &quot;When I heard Tupac sing &#x27;It&#x27;s a White Man&#x27;s World&#x27; I decided to take hip hop seriously&quot;. In addition to the influences from American hip hop, it also includes musical elements from Palestinian and Arabic music including &quot;zajal, mawwal, and saj&quot; which can be likened to Arabic spoken word, as well as including the percussiveness and lyricism of Arabic music.

Historically, music has served as an integral accompaniment to various social and religious rituals and ceremonies in Palestinian society (Al-Taee 47). Much of the Middle-Eastern and Arabic string instruments utilized in classical Palestinian music are sampled over Hip-hop beats in both Israeli and Palestinian hip-hop as part of a joint process of localization. Just as the percussiveness of the Hebrew language is emphasized in Israeli Hip-hop, Palestinian music has always revolved around the rhythmic specificity and smooth melodic tone of Arabic. &quot;Musically speaking, Palestinian songs are usually pure melody performed monophonically with complex vocal ornamentations and strong percussive rhythm beats&quot;. The presence of a hand-drum in classical Palestinian music indicates a cultural esthetic conducive to the vocal, verbal and instrumental percussion which serve as the foundational elements of Hip-hop. This hip hop is joining a &quot;longer tradition of revolutionary, underground, Arabic music and political songs that have supported Palestinian Resistance&quot;. This subgenre has served as a way to politicize the Palestinian issue through music.

====Dance====
The Dabke, a Levantine Arab folk dance style whose local Palestinian versions were appropriated by Palestinian nationalism after 1967, has, according to one scholar, possible roots that may go back to ancient Canaanite fertility rites. It is marked by synchronized jumping, stamping, and movement, similar to tap dancing. One version is performed by men, another by women.

===Sport===

Although sport facilities did exist before the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, many such facilities and institutions were subsequently shut down. Today there remains sport centers such as in Gaza and Ramallah, but the difficulty of mobility and travel restrictions means most Palestinian are not able to compete internationally to their full potential. However, Palestinian sport authorities have indicated that Palestinians in the diaspora will be eligible to compete for Palestine once the diplomatic and security situation improves.

<text>A physicist is a scientist who specializes in the field of physics, which encompasses the interactions of matter and energy at all length and time scales in the physical universe. Physicists generally are interested in the root or ultimate causes of phenomena, and usually frame their understanding in mathematical terms. They work across a wide range of research fields, spanning all length scales: from sub-atomic and particle physics, through biological physics, to cosmological length scales encompassing the universe as a whole. The field generally includes two types of physicists: experimental physicists who specialize in the observation of natural phenomena and the development and analysis of experiments, and theoretical physicists who specialize in mathematical modeling of physical systems to rationalize, explain and predict natural phenomena.

Physicists can apply their knowledge towards solving practical problems or to developing new technologies (also known as applied physics or engineering physics).

==History==
The study and practice of physics is based on an intellectual ladder of discoveries and insights from ancient times to the present. Many mathematical and physical ideas used today found their earliest expression in the work of ancient civilizations, such as the Babylonian astronomers and Egyptian engineers, the Greek philosophers of science and mathematicians such as Thales of Miletus, Euclid in Ptolemaic Egypt, Archimedes of Syracuse and Aristarchus of Samos. Roots also emerged in ancient Asian cultures such as India and China, and particularly the Islamic medieval period, which saw the development of scientific methodology emphasising experimentation, such as the work of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) in the 11th century. The modern scientific worldview and the bulk of physics education can be said to flow from the scientific revolution in Europe, starting with the work of astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus leading to the physics of Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler in the early 1600s. The work on mechanics, along with a mathematical treatment of physical systems, was further developed by Christiaan Huygens and culminated in Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation by the end of the 17th century. The experimental discoveries of Faraday and the theory of Maxwell&#x27;s equations of electromagnetism were developmental high points during the 19th century. Many physicists contributed to the development of quantum mechanics in the early-to-mid 20th century. New knowledge in the early 21st century includes a large increase in understanding physical cosmology.

The broad and general study of nature, natural philosophy, was divided into several fields in the 19th century, when the concept of &quot;science&quot; received its modern shape. Specific categories emerged, such as &quot;biology&quot; and &quot;biologist&quot;, &quot;physics&quot; and &quot;physicist&quot;, &quot;chemistry&quot; and &quot;chemist&quot;, among other technical fields and titles. The term &quot;physicist&quot; was coined by William Whewell (also the originator of the term &quot;scientist&quot;) in his 1840 book &quot;The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences&quot;.

==Education==
A standard undergraduate physics curriculum consists of classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, non-relativistic quantum mechanics, optics, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, and laboratory experience. Physics students also need training in mathematics (calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, complex analysis, etc.), and in computer science.

Any physics-oriented career position requires at least an undergraduate degree in physics or applied physics, while career options widen with a master&#x27;s degree like MSc, MPhil, MPhys or MSci. 

For research-oriented careers, students work toward a doctoral degree specializing in a particular field. Fields of specialization include experimental and theoretical astrophysics, atomic physics, biological physics, chemical physics, condensed matter physics, cosmology, geophysics, gravitational physics, material science, medical physics, microelectronics, molecular physics, nuclear physics, optics, particle physics, plasma physics, quantum information science, and radiophysics.

==Careers==
The three major employers of career physicists are academic institutions, laboratories, and private industries, with the largest employer being the last. Physicists in academia or government labs tend to have titles such as Assistants, Professors, Sr./Jr. Scientist, or postdocs. As per the American Institute of Physics, some 20% of new physics Ph.D.s holds jobs in engineering development programs, while 14% turn to computer software and about 11% are in business/education. A majority of physicists employed apply their skills and training to interdisciplinary sectors (e.g. finance). 

Job titles for graduate physicists include Agricultural Scientist, Air Traffic Controller, Biophysicist, Computer Programmer, Electrical Engineer, Environmental Analyst, Geophysicist, Medical Physicist, Meteorologist, Oceanographer, Physics Teacher/Professor/Researcher, Research Scientist, Reactor Physicist, Engineering Physicist, Satellite Missions Analyst, Science Writer, Stratigrapher, Software Engineer, Systems Engineer, Microelectronics Engineer, Radar Developer, Technical Consultant, etc.

The majority of Physics terminal bachelor&#x27;s degree holders are employed in the private sector. Other fields are academia, government and military service, nonprofit entities, labs and teaching.

Typical duties of physicists with master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees working in their domain involve research, observation and analysis, data preparation, instrumentation, design and development of industrial or medical equipment, computing and software development, etc.

==Honors and awards==

The highest honor awarded to physicists is the Nobel Prize in Physics, awarded since 1901 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. National physical societies have many prizes and awards for professional recognition. In the case of the American Physical Society, as of 2023, there are 25 separate prizes and 33 separate awards in the field.

==Professional certification==

===United Kingdom===
Chartered Physicist (CPhys) is a chartered status and a professional qualification awarded by the Institute of Physics. It is denoted by the postnominals &quot;CPhys&quot;.

Achieving chartered status in any profession denotes to the wider community a high level of specialised subject knowledge and professional competence. According to the Institute of Physics, holders of the award of the Chartered Physicist (CPhys) demonstrate the &quot;highest standards of professionalism, up-to-date expertise, quality and safety&quot; along with &quot;the capacity to undertake independent practice and exercise leadership&quot; as well as &quot;commitment to keep pace with advancing knowledge and with the increasing expectations and requirements for which any profession must take responsibility&quot;.

Chartered Physicist is considered to be equal in status to Chartered Engineer, which the IoP also awards as a member of the Engineering Council UK, and other chartered statuses in the UK. It is also considered a &quot;regulated profession&quot; under the European professional qualification directives.

===Canada===
The Canadian Association of Physicists can appoint an official designation called Professional Physicist (P. Phys.), similar to the designation of Professional Engineer (P. Eng.). This designation was unveiled at the CAP congress in 1999 and already more than 200 people carry this distinction.

To get the certification, at minimum proof of honours bachelor or higher degree in physics or a closely related discipline must be provided. Also, the physicist must have completed, or be about to complete, three years of recent physics-related work experience after graduation. And, unless exempted, a professional practice examination must also be passed. An exemption can be granted to a candidate that has practiced physics for at least seven years and provide a detailed description of their professional accomplishments which clearly demonstrate that the exam is not necessary. 

Work experience will be considered physics-related if it uses physics directly or significantly uses the modes of thought (such as the approach to problem-solving) developed in your education or experience as a physicist, in all cases regardless of whether the experience is in academia, industry, government, or elsewhere. Management of physics-related work qualifies, and so does appropriate graduate student work.

===South Africa===
The South African Institute of Physics also delivers a certification of Professional Physicist (Pr.Phys). At a minimum, the owner must possess a three-year bachelors or equivalent degree in physics or a related field and an additional minimum of six years&#x27; experience in a physics-related activity; or an Honor or equivalent degree in physics or a related field and an additional minimum of five years&#x27; experience in a physics-related activity; or master or equivalent degree in physics or a related field and an additional minimum of three years&#x27; experience in a physics-related activity; a Doctorate or equivalent degree in Physics or a related field; or training or experience which, in the opinion of the Council, is equivalent to any of the above.

==Professional societies==
Physicists may be a member of a physical society of a country or region. Physical societies commonly publish scientific journals, organize physics conferences and award prizes for contributions to the field of physics. Some examples of physical societies are the American Physical Society, the Institute of Physics, with the oldest physical society being the German Physical Society.

<text>Peter Nilson (17 October 1937 – 8 March 1998) was a Swedish astronomer and novelist. Active at Uppsala University, he compiled a catalogue of galaxies containing nearly 13,000 entries. He was appreciated for a number of essay books (primarily about science) and for a number of science fiction novels like &quot;Rymdväktaren&quot;, or &quot;The Space Guardian&quot; and &quot;Nyaga&quot;.

He was born in the Smålandian village of Näsby and under the early teens a farmer, but science, with its celebrities such as Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein made such an impression on him, as to motivate him to accomplish college studies by letter correspondence. In the early 1960s he began his studies in Uppsala University, initially in mathematics, and thereafter theoretical physics, aesthetics, history of ideas and astronomy.

He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1993.

<text>A patent is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the legal right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention for a limited period of time in exchange for publishing an enabling disclosure of the invention. In most countries, patent rights fall under private law and the patent holder must sue someone infringing the patent in order to enforce their rights.

The procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a patent application must include one or more claims that define the scope of protection that is being sought. A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right.

Under the World Trade Organization&#x27;s (WTO) TRIPS Agreement, patents should be available in WTO member states for any invention, in all fields of technology, provided they are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application. Nevertheless, there are variations on what is patentable subject matter from country to country, also among WTO member states. TRIPS also provides that the term of protection available should be a minimum of twenty years. Some countries have other patent-like forms of intellectual property, such as utility models, which have a shorter monopoly period.

==Definition==
The word &quot;patent&quot; originates from the Latin &quot;patere&quot;, which means &quot;to lay open&quot; (i.e., to make available for public inspection). It is a shortened version of the term &quot;letters patent&quot;, which was an open document or instrument issued by a monarch or government granting exclusive rights to a person, predating the modern patent system. Similar grants included land patents, which were land grants by early state governments in the US, and printing patents, a precursor of modern copyright.

In modern usage, the term &quot;patent&quot; usually refers to the right granted to anyone who invents something new, useful and non-obvious. A patent is often referred to as a form of intellectual property right, an expression which is also used to refer to trademarks and copyrights, and which has proponents and detractors (see also Intellectual property § The term &quot;intellectual property&quot;).

Some other types of intellectual property rights are also called &quot;patents&quot; in some jurisdictions: industrial design rights are called &quot;design patents&quot; in the US, plant breeders&#x27; rights are sometimes called &quot;plant patents&quot;, and utility models and &quot;Gebrauchsmuster&quot; are sometimes called &quot;petty patents&quot; or &quot;innovation patents&quot;. The additional qualification &quot;utility patent&quot; is sometimes used (primarily in the US) to distinguish the primary meaning from these other types of patents.

Particular types of patents for inventions include biological patents, business method patents, chemical patents and software patents.

==History==
Although there is evidence that some form of patent rights was recognized in Ancient Greece in the city of Sybaris, the first statutory patent system is generally regarded to be the Venetian Patent Statute of 1474. However, recent historical research has suggested that the 1474 Statute was inspired by laws in the Kingdom of Jerusalem that granted monopolies to developers of novel silk-making techniques. Patents were systematically granted in Venice as of 1474, where they issued a decree by which new and inventive devices had to be communicated to the Republic in order to obtain legal protection against potential infringers. The period of protection was 10 years. As Venetians emigrated, they sought similar patent protection in their new homes. This led to the diffusion of patent systems to other countries.

The English patent system evolved from its early medieval origins into the first modern patent system that recognised intellectual property in order to stimulate invention; this was the crucial legal foundation upon which the Industrial Revolution could emerge and flourish. By the 16th century, the English Crown would habitually abuse the granting of letters patent for monopolies. After public outcry, King James I of England (VI of Scotland) was forced to revoke all existing monopolies and declare that they were only to be used for &quot;projects of new invention&quot;. This was incorporated into the Statute of Monopolies (1624) in which Parliament restricted the Crown&#x27;s power explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed number of years. The Statute became the foundation for later developments in patent law in England and elsewhere.
Important developments in patent law emerged during the 18th century through a slow process of judicial interpretation of the law. During the reign of Queen Anne, patent applications were required to supply a complete specification of the principles of operation of the invention for public access. Legal battles around the 1796 patent taken out by James Watt for his steam engine, established the principles that patents could be issued for improvements of an already existing machine and that ideas or principles without specific practical application could also legally be patented.

The English legal system became the foundation for patent law in countries with a common law heritage, including the United States, New Zealand and Australia. In the Thirteen Colonies, inventors could obtain patents through petition to a given colony&#x27;s legislature. In 1641, Samuel Winslow was granted the first patent in North America by the Massachusetts General Court for a new process for making salt.

The modern French patent system was created during the Revolution in 1791. Patents were granted without examination since inventor&#x27;s right was considered as a natural one. Patent costs were very high (from 500 to 1,500 francs). Importation patents protected new devices coming from foreign countries. The patent law was revised in 1844patent cost was lowered and importation patents were abolished.

The first Patent Act of the U.S. Congress was passed on April 10, 1790, titled &quot;An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts&quot;. The first patent under the Act was granted on July 31, 1790, to Samuel Hopkins of Vermont for a method of producing potash (potassium carbonate). A revised patent law was passed in 1793, and in 1836 a major revision was passed. The 1836 law instituted a significantly more rigorous application process, including the establishment of an examination system. Between 1790 and 1836 about ten thousand patents were granted. By the American Civil War about 80,000 patents had been granted.

=== Gender gap in patents ===

In the US, married women were historically precluded from obtaining patents. While section 1 of the Patent Act of 1790 did refer to &quot;she&quot;, married women were unable to own property in their own name and were also prohibited from rights to their own income, including income from anything they invented. This historical gender gap has lessened over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, however, disparity is still prevalent. In the UK, for example, only 8% of inventors were female as of 2015. This can partly be attributed to historical barriers for women to obtain patents, as well as to the fact that women are underrepresented in traditionally &quot;patent-intensive&quot; sectors, particularly STEM sectors. Marcowitz-Bitton et al. argue that the gender gap in patents is also a result of internal bias within the patent system.

=== Innovation decline ===

The number of patent applications filed each year has been growing for most countries although not smoothly, and jumps in activity are often observed due to changes in local laws. The high number of patent families for Spain in the 1800s is related to the superior preservation and cataloguing of the data by Spanish Patent and Trademark Office compared to other countries (see 1836 U.S. Patent Office fire). The US was the World&#x27;s leader in terms of patent families filed between 1900 and 1966, when Japan took over. Since 2007 PR China leads.

However, in most technologically advanced countries (see, for example, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, the UK in the figure on the right, as well as in Poland), the total (i.e. regardless of the priority/inventors&#x27; country) number of patent families filed there have been declining in absolute numbers since –1980s. The decline is even more pronounced when the number of patent applications is normalized by the country&#x27;s population each year, or when the country of origin rather than country of filing is used. For the US, the population-normalized peak in patenting occurred in 1915, and the number of subsequent patents induced per patent has been mostly declining since 1926. A study of 4,512 patents obtained by Stanford University between 1970 and 2020 showed that the university&#x27;s patenting activity plateaued in the 2010s. Incidentally, only 20% of Stanford patents in that dataset produced a positive net income for the university, while the rest was a net loss.

Similar declines have been noted not only for the number of patents, but also for other measures of innovation output.

Several hypotheses have been proposed as explanations for the observed decline:

# increasing cost of doing research, as &quot;lower-hanging fruits have been picked up&quot;;
# decrease in productivity per researcher; This occurred because factor (1) (higher hanging fruits) overwhelms increased efficiency in computation, automation, big data analysis and communication.
# human civilization is reaching the limits of the human brain rather than technological limits. &quot;For the first time in history people are bombarded with far more information than they can process.&quot;
# It has also been suggested that the rate of innovation is proportional to the rate of population growth (rather than to the total population), and that the observed decline in research productivity is related to the resource-limited Malthusian growth model.
# increasing fragmentation of patent encumbrance and increasing number and cost of patent litigations;
# decreasing value of patents in post-industrial economies, as businesses prefer less risky and more profitable investments in software rather than in hardware, which can be protected more effectively and at a lower cost by using copyrights, trade secrets, first mover advantage, download limitations (see digital economy). A related decline of manufacturing share in the GDP of post-industrial countries has been reported in some studies.
# a slow-down in patent applications in the US has been attributed to court decisions in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.(2012), Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. (2013) and Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International (2014) limiting the eligibility of business method and biological patents. Similar restrictions on software patents have been enacted in other countries.
# the number of patent applications from PR China is expected to go down after 2025, when government subsidies for patent filing are to expire.
# patents that are registered but not commercialized, as is the case in around 50% of them, function as a barrier to the registration of similar ideas, effectively creating a growing zone of non-patentability.

==Law==
===Effects===
A patent does not give a right to make or use or sell an invention. Rather, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the right to &quot;exclude others&quot; from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented invention for the term of the patent, which is usually 20 years from the filing date subject to the payment of maintenance fees. From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor &quot;a right to &quot;try&quot; to exclude by asserting the patent in court&quot;, for many granted patents turn out to be invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court. A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public. Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, mortgaged, assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.

A patent, being an exclusionary right, does not necessarily give the patent owner the right to exploit the invention subject to the patent. For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else&#x27;s patent. If an inventor obtains a patent on improvements to an existing invention which is still under patent, they can only legally use the improved invention if the patent holder of the original invention gives permission, which they may refuse.

Some countries have &quot;working provisions&quot; that require the invention be exploited in the jurisdiction it covers. Consequences of not working an invention vary from one country to another, ranging from revocation of the patent rights to the awarding of a compulsory license awarded by the courts to a party wishing to exploit a patented invention. The patentee has the opportunity to challenge the revocation or license, but is usually required to provide evidence that the reasonable requirements of the public have been met by the working of invention.

===Challenges===

In most jurisdictions, there are ways for third parties to challenge the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the national patent office; these are called opposition proceedings. It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court. In either case, the challenging party tries to prove that the patent should never have been granted. There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not patentable subject matter at all; the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to the person skilled in the art, at the time the application was filed; or that some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc. Patents can be found to be invalid in whole or in part for any of these reasons.

===Infringement===

Patent infringement occurs when a third party, without authorization from the patentee, makes, uses, or sells a patented invention. Patents, however, are enforced on a national basis. The making of an item in China, for example, that would infringe a US patent, would not constitute infringement under US patent law unless the item were imported into the US.

Infringement includes literal infringement of a patent, meaning they are performing a prohibited act that is protected against by the patent. There is also the Doctrine of Equivalents. This doctrine protects from someone creating a product that is basically, by all rights, the same product that is protected with just a few modifications. In some countries, like the United States, there is liability for another two forms of infringement. One is contributory infringement, which is participating in another&#x27;s infringement. This could be a company helping another company to create a patented product or selling the patented product which is created by another company. There is also inducement to infringement, which is when a party induces or assists another party in violating a patent. An example of this would be a company paying another party to create a patented product in order to reduce their competitor&#x27;s market share. This is important when it comes to gray market goods, which is when a patent owner sells a product in country A, wherein they have the product patented, then another party buys and sells it, without the owner&#x27;s permission, in country B, wherein the owner also has a patent for the product. With either national or regional exhaustion being the law the in country B, the owner may still be able to enforce their patent rights; however, if country B has a policy of international exhaustion, then the patent owner will have no legal grounds for enforcing the patent in country B as it was already sold in a different country.

===Enforcement===
Patents can generally only be enforced through civil lawsuits (for example, for a US patent, by an action for patent infringement in a United States federal district court), although some countries (such as France and Austria) have criminal penalties for infringement. Typically, the patent owner seeks monetary compensation (damages) for past infringement, and seeks an injunction that prohibits the defendant from engaging in future acts of infringement, or seeks either damages or injunction. To prove infringement, the patent owner must establish that the accused infringer practises all the requirements of at least one of the claims of the patent. (In many jurisdictions the scope of the patent may not be limited to what is literally stated in the claims, for example due to the &quot;doctrine of equivalents&quot;.)

An accused infringer has the right to challenge the validity of the patent allegedly being infringed in a counterclaim. A patent can be found invalid on grounds described in the relevant patent laws, which vary between countries. Often, the grounds are a subset of requirements for patentability in the relevant country. Although an infringer is generally free to rely on any available ground of invalidity (such as a prior publication, for example), some countries have sanctions to prevent the same validity questions being relitigated. An example is the UK Certificate of contested validity.

Patent licensing agreements are contracts in which the patent owner (the licensor) agrees to grant the licensee the right to make, use, sell, or import the claimed invention, usually in return for a royalty or other compensation. It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into multiple license agreements associated with the production of a single product. Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under cross-licensing agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other&#x27;s patented inventions. Freedom Licenses like the Apache 2.0 License are a hybrid of copyright/trademark/patent license/contract due to the bundling nature of the three intellectual properties in one central license. This can make it difficult to enforce because patent licenses cannot be granted this way under copyright and would have to be considered a contract.

===Ownership===
In most countries, both natural persons and corporate entities may apply for a patent. In the United States, however, only the inventor(s) may apply for a patent, although it may be assigned to a corporate entity subsequently and inventors may be required to assign inventions to their employers under an employment contract. In most European countries, ownership of an invention may pass from the inventor to their employer by rule of law if the invention was made in the course of the inventor&#x27;s normal or specifically assigned employment duties, where an invention might reasonably be expected to result from carrying out those duties, or if the inventor had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer&#x27;s company. Applications by artificial intelligence systems, such as DABUS, have been rejected in the US, the UK, and at the European Patent Office on the grounds they are not natural persons.
The inventors, their successors or their assignees become the proprietors of the patent when and if it is granted. If a patent is granted to more than one proprietor, the laws of the country in question and any agreement between the proprietors may affect the extent to which each proprietor can exploit the patent. For example, in some countries, each proprietor may freely license or assign their rights in the patent to another person while the law in other countries prohibits such actions without the permission of the other proprietor(s).

The ability to assign ownership rights increases the liquidity of a patent as property. Inventors can obtain patents and then sell them to third parties. The third parties then own the patents and have the same rights to prevent others from exploiting the claimed inventions, as if they had originally made the inventions themselves.

===Governing laws===
The grant and enforcement of patents are governed by national laws, and also by international treaties, where those treaties have been given effect in national laws. Patents are granted by national or regional patent offices, i.e. national or regional administrative authorities. A given patent is therefore only useful for protecting an invention in the country in which that patent is granted. In other words, patent law is territorial in nature. When a patent application is published, the invention disclosed in the application becomes prior art and enters the public domain (if not protected by other patents) in countries where a patent applicant does not seek protection, the application thus generally becoming prior art against anyone (including the applicant) who might seek patent protection for the invention in those countries.

Commonly, a nation or a group of nations forms a patent office with responsibility for operating that nation&#x27;s patent system, within the relevant patent laws. The patent office generally has responsibility for the grant of patents, with infringement being the remit of national courts.

The authority for patent statutes in different countries varies. In the UK, substantive patent law is contained in the Patents Act 1977 as amended. In the United States, the Constitution empowers Congress to make laws to &quot;promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts ...&quot;. The laws Congress passed are codified in Title 35 of the United States Code and created the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

There is a trend towards global harmonization of patent laws, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) being particularly active in this area. The TRIPS Agreement has been largely successful in providing a forum for nations to agree on an aligned set of patent laws. Conformity with the TRIPS agreement is a requirement of admission to the WTO and so compliance is seen by many nations as important. This has also led to many developing nations, which may historically have developed different laws to aid their development, enforcing patents laws in line with global practice.

Internationally, there are international treaty procedures, such as the procedures under the European Patent Convention (EPC) [constituting the European Patent Organisation (EPOrg)], that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of ARIPO and OAPI, the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine CIS member states that have formed the Eurasian Patent Organization. A key international convention relating to patents is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, the principles of the convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The Paris Convention set a minimum patent protection of 20 years, but the most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim priority: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Another key treaty is the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and covering more than 150 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states along with giving owners a 30-month priority for applications as opposed to the standard 12 the Paris Convention granted. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application. The steps for PCT applications are as follows:

1. Filing the PCT patent application

2. Examination during the international phase

3. Examination during the national phase.

Alongside these international agreements for patents there was the Patent Law Treaty (PLT). This treaty standardized the filing date requirements, standardized the application and forms, allows for electronic communication and filing, and avoids unintentional loss of rights, and simplifies patent office procedures.

Sometimes, nations grant others, other than the patent owner, permissions to create a patented product based on different situations that align with public policy or public interest. These may include compulsory licenses, scientific research, and in transit in country.

=== Anti-biopiracy dispositions ===
After two decades of drafting, the WIPO&#x27;s Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore moved to a Diplomatic Conference in May 2024 and adopted the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (GRATK Treaty) mandating patent disclosure requirements for patents based on genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge from being granted. The Treaty contemplates revocation for patents incorrectly filed.

The treaty, and in particular its planned extension, is seen as complementing the Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity and its system of Access and Benefit-Sharing. Representatives of Indigenous peoples view the GRATK Treaty as a &quot;first step towards guaranteeing just and transparent access to these resources.&quot;

===Application and prosecution===

Before filing for an application, which must be paid for whether a patent is granted or not, a person will want to ensure that their material is patentable. Patentable material must be synthetic, meaning that anything natural cannot be patented. For example, minerals, materials, genes, facts, organisms, and biological processes cannot be patented, but if someone were to apply an inventive, non-obvious, step to them to synthesize something new, the result could be patentable. That includes genetically engineered strains of bacteria, as was decided in Diamond v. Chakrabarty. Patentability also depends on public policy and ethical standards. Additionally, patentable materials must be novel, useful, and a non-obvious inventive step.
A patent is requested by filing a written application at the relevant patent office. The person or company filing the application is referred to as &quot;the applicant&quot;. The applicant may be the inventor or its assignee. The application contains a description of how to make and use the invention that must provide sufficient detail for a person skilled in the art (i.e., the relevant area of technology) to make and use the invention. In some countries there are requirements for providing specific information such as the usefulness of the invention, the best mode of performing the invention known to the inventor, or the technical problem or problems solved by the invention. Drawings illustrating the invention may also be provided.

The application also includes one or more claims that define what a patent covers or the &quot;scope of protection&quot;.

After filing, an application is often referred to as &quot;patent pending&quot;. While this term does not confer legal protection, and a patent cannot be enforced until granted, it serves to provide warning to potential infringers that if the patent is issued, they may be liable for damages.

Once filed, a patent application is &quot;prosecuted&quot;. A patent examiner reviews the patent application to determine if it meets the patentability requirements of that country. If the application does not comply, objections are communicated to the applicant or their patent agent or attorney through an Office action, to which the applicant may respond. The number of Office actions and responses that may occur vary from country to country, but eventually a final rejection is sent by the patent office, or the patent application is granted, which after the payment of additional fees, leads to an issued, enforceable patent. In some jurisdictions, there are opportunities for third parties to bring an opposition proceeding between grant and issuance, or post-issuance.

Once granted the patent is subject in most countries to renewal fees to keep the patent in force. These fees are generally payable on a yearly basis. Some countries or regional patent offices (e.g. the European Patent Office) also require annual renewal fees to be paid for a patent application before it is granted. In the US, patent maintenance fees are due on 3.5, 7.5 and 11.5 anniversaries of the patent issuance. Only ca. 50% of issued US patents are maintained full term. Large corporations tend to pay maintenance fees through the full term, while small companies are more likely to abandon their patents earlier, even though the due fees are ca. 5 times lower for small businesses (microentities). 

====Costs====
The costs of preparing and filing a patent application, prosecuting it until grant and maintaining the patent vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may also be dependent upon the type and complexity of the invention, and on the type of patent.

The European Patent Office estimated in 2005 that the average cost of obtaining a European patent (via a Euro-direct application, i.e. not based on a PCT application) and maintaining the patent for a 10-year term was around €32,000. Since the London Agreement entered into force on May 1, 2008, this estimation is however no longer up-to-date, since fewer translations are required.

After a patent is issued, in most countries patent maintenance payments are required. In some countries (e.g. Russia) fees are due every year, and the amount due does not change much. In other countries (e.g. US) payments are due ca. every 4th year after the grant date, and the amount due increases every time. A 2023 study by Rochester Institute of Technology found the full term maintenance rate of issued US patents has been fairly constant (40-50%) since 1992. Full term patents have more issued claims and receive on average more citations than earlier expired patents.

The European Patent Office charges annual fees for pending applications. Also, between 2012 and 2016 Ecuador increased its patent maintenance fees ten-fold, briefly becoming the most expensive country to maintain patents.

In the United States, in 2000 the cost of obtaining a patent (patent prosecution) was estimated to be from $10,000 to $30,000 per patent. When patent litigation is involved (which in year 1999 happened in about 1,600 cases compared to 153,000 patents issued in the same year), costs increase significantly: although 95% of patent litigation cases are settled out of court, those that reach the courts have legal costs on the order of a million dollars per case, not including associated business costs.

====Non-national treatment in the application procedure====

Non-national treatments in national patent offices had been prevalent among the Northern countries until they were prohibited after the negotiation of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. According to Articles 2 and 3 of this treaty, juristic and natural persons who are either national of or domiciled in a state party to the Convention shall, as regards the protection of industrial property, enjoy in all the other countries of the Union, the advantages that their respective laws grant to nationals.

In addition, the TRIPS Agreement explicitly prohibits any such discrimination. TRIPS Agreement Article 27.1 states that &#x27;patents shall be available and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the place of invention, the field of technology and whether products are imported or locally produced&#x27;.

===Alternatives===
A defensive publication is the act of publishing a detailed description of a new invention without patenting it, so as to establish prior art and public identification as the creator/originator of an invention, although a defensive publication can also be anonymous. A defensive publication prevents others from later being able to patent the invention.

A trade secret is information that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by non-disclosure agreement and labour law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and industrial espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that the value of a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public. The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.

==Benefits==

Primary incentives embodied in the patent system include incentives to invent in the first place; to disclose the invention once made; to invest the sums necessary to experiment, produce and market the invention; and to design around and improve upon earlier patents.

Patents provide incentives for economically efficient research and development (R&amp;D). A study conducted annually by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) shows that the 2,000 largest global companies invested more than 430 billion euros in 2008 in their R&amp;D departments. If the investments can be considered as inputs of R&amp;D, real products and patents are the outputs. Based on these groups, a project named Corporate Invention Board, had measured and analyzed the patent portfolios to produce an original picture of their technological profiles. Supporters of patents argue that without patent protection, R&amp;D spending would be significantly less or eliminated altogether, limiting the possibility of technological advances or breakthroughs. Corporations would be much more conservative about the R&amp;D investments they made, as third parties would be free to exploit any developments.

The logical consequence of more efficient R&amp;D is a more efficient national economy: An increase in patenting has proven to be linked with an increase of national income. A 2009 study on patent effects in various countries around the world finds, for instance, that a 10% increase in patenting in 1910 led on average to a 9 to 11% higher level of per capita GDP in 1960. The positive effects of patenting on national income were found to be particularly strong in the U.S., Switzerland and Sweden. However, patenting is not the only factor influencing GDP growth: among others, schooling also plays a big role.

&quot;The patent internalizes the externality by giving the [inventor] a property right over its invention.&quot;

In accordance with the original definition of the term &quot;patent&quot;, patents are intended to facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovations into the public domain for the common good. Thus patenting can be viewed as contributing to open hardware after an embargo period (usually of 20 years). If inventors did not have the legal protection of patents, in many cases, they might prefer or tend to keep their inventions secret (e.g. keep trade secrets). Awarding patents generally makes the details of new technology publicly available, for exploitation by anyone after the patent expires, or for further improvement by other inventors. Furthermore, when a patent&#x27;s term has expired, the public record ensures that the patentee&#x27;s invention is not lost to humanity.

One effect of modern patent usage is that a small-time inventor, who can afford both the patenting process and the defense of the patent, can use the exclusive right status to become a licensor. This allows the inventor to accumulate capital from licensing the invention and may allow innovation to occur because he or she may choose not to manage a manufacturing buildup for the invention. Thus the inventor&#x27;s time and energy can be spent on pure innovation, allowing others to concentrate on manufacturability.

Another effect of modern patent usage is the social benefit(s) of technology disclosure. Although patentees usually end up not reaping benefit from their patent monopoly, the society still benefits from patent disclosures. Also patents both enable and incentivize competitors to design around (or to &quot;invent around&quot; according to R S Praveen Raj) the patented invention. This may promote healthy competition among manufacturers, resulting in gradual improvements of the technology base.

==Criticism==


Legal scholars, economists, activists, policymakers, industries, and trade organizations have held differing views on patents and engaged in contentious debates on the subject. Critical perspectives emerged in the nineteenth century that were especially based on the principles of free trade. Contemporary criticisms have echoed those arguments, claiming that patents block innovation and waste resources (e.g. with patent-related overheads) that could otherwise be used productively to improve technology. These and other research findings that patents decreased innovation because of the following mechanisms:
* Low quality, already known or obvious patents hamper innovation and commercialization.
* Blocking the use of fundamental knowledge with patents creates a &quot;tragedy of the anticommons, where future innovations can not take place outside of a single firm in an entire field&quot;.
* Patents weaken the public domain and innovation that comes from it.
* Patent thickets, or &quot;an overlapping set of patent rights&quot;, in particular slow innovation.
* Broad patents prevent companies from commercializing products and hurt innovation. In the worst case, such broad patents are held by non-practicing entities (patent trolls), which do not contribute to innovation. Enforcement by patent trolls of poor quality patents has led to criticism of the patent office as well as the system itself. For example, in 2011, United States business entities incurred $29 billion in direct costs because of patent trolls. Lawsuits brought by &quot;patent assertion companies&quot; made up 61% of all patent cases in 2012, according to the Santa Clara University School of Law.
* Patents apply a &quot;one size fits all&quot; model to industries with differing needs, that is especially unproductive for the software industry.
* Rent-seeking by owners of pharmaceutical patents have also been a particular focus of criticism, as the high prices they enable puts life-saving drugs out of reach of many people.
* &quot;With the partial exception of the pharmaceutical industry, we just do not have clear evidence to support the assumption that patents provide significant incentives to inventive activity&quot;.

Boldrin and Levine conclude &quot;Our preferred policy solution is to abolish patents entirely and to find other legislative instruments, less open to lobbying and rent seeking, to foster innovation when there is clear evidence that laissez-faire undersupplies it.&quot; Abolishing patents may be politically challenging in some countries, however, as the primary economic theories supporting patent law hold that inventors and innovators need patents to recoup the costs associated with research, inventing, and commercializing; this reasoning is weakened if the new technologies decrease these costs. A 2016 paper argued for substantial weakening of patents because current technologies (e.g. 3D printing, cloud computing, synthetic biology, etc.) have reduced the cost of innovation.

Debates over the usefulness of patents for their primary objective are part of a larger discourse on intellectual property protection, which also reflects differing perspectives on copyright.

=== Anti-patent initiatives ===
* Patents on expensive medications are often used as examples that can highlight the inadequacy of patent-based mechanisms. One workaround solution that has been applied by South Africa in the past is passing explained domestic law that gives the state the right to import inexpensive generic versions without permission and wait for international regulations and incentive-systems to get upgraded at a later point.
* In 2020, multiple initiatives, including by India and South Africa, called for a waiver of TRIPS vaccine patents for accelerated deployment of COVID-19 vaccines around the world. However, no mechanisms of alternative medical research and development incentive-systems or technical details of proposed &quot;sharing&quot; after certain amounts of profit were reported and some argue that, instead of intellectual property rights, manufacturing know-how is the main barrier to expanding capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1136/bmj.n2375&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Patent Busting Project is an Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) initiative challenging patents that the organization claims are illegitimate and suppress innovation or limit online expression. The initiative launched in 2004 and involves two phases: documenting the damage caused by these patents, and submitting challenges to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
* Patent critic, Joseph Stiglitz has proposed Prizes as an alternative to patents in order to further advance solutions to global problems such as AIDS.
* In 2012, Stack Exchange launched Ask Patents, a forum for crowdsourcing prior art to invalidate patents.
* Several authors have argued for developing defensive prior art to prevent patenting based on obviousness using lists or algorithms. For example, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina School of Law, has demonstrated a method to protect DNA research, which could apply to other technology. Chin wrote an algorithm to generate 11 million &quot;obvious&quot; nucleotide sequences to count as prior art and his algorithmic approach has already proven effective at anticipating prior art against oligonucleotide composition claims filed since his publication of the list and has been cited by the U.S. patent office a number of times. More recently, Joshua Pearce developed an open-source algorithm for identifying prior art for 3D printing materials to make such materials obvious by patent standards. As the 3-D printing community is already grappling with legal issues, this development was hotly debated in the technical press. Chin made the same algorithm-based obvious argument in DNA probes.
* Google and other technology companies founded the LOT Network in 2014 to combat patent assertion entities by cross-licensing patents, thereby preventing legal action by such entities.

<doc id="23275" wikidata="Q10261" url="?curid=23275" title="Pythagoras">
<text>Pythagoras of Samos (;  BC) was an ancient Ionian Greek philosopher, polymath, and the eponymous founder of Pythagoreanism. His political and religious teachings were well known in Magna Graecia and influenced the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and, through them, Western philosophy. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras&#x27;s education and influences, but most agree that he travelled to Croton in southern Italy around 530 BC, where he founded a school in which initiates were allegedly sworn to secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle.

In antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with mathematical and scientific discoveries, such as the Pythagorean theorem, Pythagorean tuning, the five regular solids, the theory of proportions, the sphericity of the Earth, the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus, and the division of the globe into five climatic zones. He was reputedly the first man to call himself a philosopher (&quot;lover of wisdom&quot;). Historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries and pronouncements, as some of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors, such as Hippasus and Philolaus.

The teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is the &quot;transmigration of souls&quot; or &quot;metempsychosis&quot;, which holds that every soul is immortal and, upon death, enters into a new body. He may have also devised the doctrine of &quot;musica universalis&quot;, which holds that the planets move according to mathematical ratios and thus resonate to produce an inaudible symphony of music. Following Croton&#x27;s decisive victory over Sybaris in around 510 BC, Pythagoras&#x27;s followers came into conflict with supporters of democracy, and their meeting houses were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or he may have escaped to Metapontum and died there.

Pythagoras influenced Plato whose dialogues (especially &quot;Timaeus&quot;) exhibit Pythagorean ideas. A major revival of his teachings occurred in the first century BC among Middle Platonists, coinciding with the rise of Neopythagoreanism. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great philosopher throughout the Middle Ages and Pythagoreanism had an influence on scientists such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton. Pythagorean symbolism was also used throughout early modern European esotericism, and his teachings as portrayed in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; would later influence the modern vegetarian movement.

== Biographical sources ==
No authentic writings of Pythagoras have survived, and almost nothing is known for certain about his life. The earliest sources on Pythagoras&#x27;s life are brief, ambiguous, and often satirical. The earliest source on Pythagoras&#x27;s teachings is a satirical poem probably written after his death by the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon ( BC), who had been one of his contemporaries. In the poem, Xenophanes describes Pythagoras interceding on behalf of a dog that is being beaten, professing to recognize in its cries the voice of a departed friend. Alcmaeon of Croton ( BC), a doctor who lived in Croton at around the same time Pythagoras lived there, incorporates many Pythagorean teachings into his writings and alludes to having possibly known Pythagoras personally. The poet Heraclitus of Ephesus ( BC), who was born across a few miles of sea away from Samos and may have lived within Pythagoras&#x27;s lifetime, mocked Pythagoras as a clever charlatan, remarking that &quot;Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practiced inquiry more than any other man, and selecting from these writings he manufactured a wisdom for himself—much learning, artful knavery.&quot;

The Greek poets Ion of Chios ( BC) and Empedocles of Acragas ( BC) both express admiration for Pythagoras in their poems. The first concise description of Pythagoras comes from the historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus ( BC), who describes him as one of the greatest Greek teachers and states that Pythagoras taught his followers how to attain immortality. The accuracy of the works of Herodotus is controversial. The writings attributed to the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus of Croton ( BC) are the earliest texts to describe the numerological and musical theories that were later ascribed to Pythagoras. The Athenian rhetorician Isocrates ( BC) was the first to describe Pythagoras as having visited Egypt. Aristotle ( BC) wrote a treatise &quot;On the Pythagoreans&quot;, which no longer exists. Some of it may be preserved in the &quot;Protrepticus&quot;. Aristotle&#x27;s disciples Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus, and Heraclides Ponticus (who all lived in the 3rd century BC) also wrote on the same subject.

Most of the major sources on Pythagoras&#x27;s life are from the Roman period, by which point, according to the German classicist Walter Burkert, &quot;the history of Pythagoreanism was already... the laborious reconstruction of something lost and gone.&quot; Three ancient biographies of Pythagoras have survived from late antiquity, all of which are filled primarily with myths and legends. The earliest and most respectable of these is the one from Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;. The two later biographies were written by the Neoplatonist philosophers Porphyry and Iamblichus and were partially intended as polemics against the rise of Christianity. The later sources are much lengthier than the earlier ones, and even more fantastic in their descriptions of Pythagoras&#x27;s achievements. Porphyry and Iamblichus used material from the lost writings of Aristotle&#x27;s disciples (Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus, and Heraclides) and material taken from these sources is generally considered to be the most reliable.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Herodotus, Isocrates, and other early writers agree that Pythagoras was the son of Mnesarchus, and that he was born on the Greek island of Samos in the eastern Aegean. According to these biographers, Pythagoras&#x27;s father was not born on the island, although he got naturalized there, but according to Iamblichus he was a native of the island. He is said to have been a gem-engraver or a wealthy merchant but his ancestry is disputed and unclear. His mother was a native of Samos, descending from a &quot;geomoroi&quot; family. Apollonius of Tyana, gives her name as Pythaïs. Iamblichus tells the story that the Pythia prophesied to her while she was pregnant with him that she would give birth to a man supremely beautiful, wise, and beneficial to humankind. As to the date of his birth, Aristoxenus stated that Pythagoras left Samos in the reign of Polycrates, at the age of 40, which would give a date of birth around 570 BC. Pythagoras&#x27;s name led him to be associated with Pythian Apollo (); Aristippus of Cyrene in the 4th century BC explained his name by saying, &quot;He spoke [, ] the truth no less than did the Pythian [ ]&quot;.

During Pythagoras&#x27;s formative years, Samos was a thriving cultural hub known for its feats of advanced architectural engineering, including the building of the Tunnel of Eupalinos, and for its riotous festival culture. It was a major center of trade in the Aegean where traders brought goods from the Near East. According to Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier, these traders almost certainly brought with them Near Eastern ideas and traditions. Pythagoras&#x27;s early life also coincided with the flowering of early Ionian natural philosophy. He was a contemporary of the philosophers Anaximander, Anaximenes, and the historian Hecataeus, all of whom lived in Miletus, across the sea from Samos.

=== Reputed travels ===

Pythagoras is traditionally thought to have received most of his education in the Near East. Modern scholarship has shown that the culture of Archaic Greece was heavily influenced by those of Levantine and Mesopotamian cultures. Like many other important Greek thinkers, Pythagoras was said to have studied in Egypt. By the time of Isocrates in the fourth century BC, Pythagoras&#x27;s reputed studies in Egypt were already taken as fact. The writer Antiphon, who may have lived during the Hellenistic Era, claimed in his lost work &quot;On Men of Outstanding Merit&quot;, used as a source by Porphyry, that Pythagoras learned to speak Egyptian from the Pharaoh Amasis II himself, that he studied with the Egyptian priests at Diospolis (Thebes), and that he was the only foreigner ever to be granted the privilege of taking part in their worship. The Middle Platonist biographer Plutarch ( AD) writes in his treatise &quot;On Isis and Osiris&quot; that, during his visit to Egypt, Pythagoras received instruction from the Egyptian priest Oenuphis of Heliopolis (meanwhile Solon received lectures from a Sonchis of Sais). According to the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria ( AD), &quot;Pythagoras was a disciple of Sonchis, an Egyptian archprophet, as well as a Plato of Sechnuphis.&quot; Some ancient writers claimed that Pythagoras learned geometry and the doctrine of metempsychosis from the Egyptians.

Other ancient writers, however, claimed that Pythagoras had learned these teachings from the Magi in Persia or even from Zoroaster himself. Diogenes Laërtius asserts that Pythagoras later visited Crete, where he went to the Cave of Ida with Epimenides. The Phoenicians are reputed to have taught Pythagoras arithmetic and the Chaldeans to have taught him astronomy. By the third century BC, Pythagoras was already reported to have studied under the Jews as well. Contradicting all these reports, the novelist Antonius Diogenes, writing in the second century BC, reports that Pythagoras discovered all his doctrines himself by interpreting dreams. The third-century AD Sophist Philostratus claims that, in addition to the Egyptians, Pythagoras also studied under sages or gymnosophists in India. Iamblichus expands this list even further by claiming that Pythagoras also studied with the Celts and Iberians.

=== Alleged Greek teachers ===

Ancient sources also record Pythagoras having studied under a variety of native Greek thinkers. Some identify Hermodamas of Samos as a possible tutor. Hermodamas represented the indigenous Samian rhapsodic tradition and his father Creophylos was said to have been the host of his rival poet Homer. Others credit Bias of Priene, Thales, or Anaximander (a pupil of Thales). Other traditions claim the mythic bard Orpheus as Pythagoras&#x27;s teacher, thus representing the Orphic Mysteries. The Neoplatonists wrote of a &quot;sacred discourse&quot; Pythagoras had written on the gods in the Doric Greek dialect, which they believed had been dictated to Pythagoras by the Orphic priest Aglaophamus upon his initiation to the orphic Mysteries at Leibethra. Iamblichus credited Orpheus with having been the model for Pythagoras&#x27;s manner of speech, his spiritual attitude, and his manner of worship. Iamblichus describes Pythagoreanism as a synthesis of everything Pythagoras had learned from Orpheus, from the Egyptian priests, from the Eleusinian Mysteries, and from other religious and philosophical traditions. Riedweg states that, although these stories are fanciful, Pythagoras&#x27;s teachings were definitely influenced by Orphism to a noteworthy extent.

Of the various Greek sages claimed to have taught Pythagoras, Pherecydes of Syros is mentioned most often. Similar miracle stories were told about both Pythagoras and Pherecydes, including one in which the hero predicts a shipwreck, one in which he predicts the conquest of Messina, and one in which he drinks from a well and predicts an earthquake. Apollonius Paradoxographus, a paradoxographer who may have lived in the second century BC, identified Pythagoras&#x27;s thaumaturgic ideas as a result of Pherecydes&#x27;s influence. Another story, which may be traced to the Neopythagorean philosopher Nicomachus, tells that, when Pherecydes was old and dying on the island of Delos, Pythagoras returned to care for him and pay his respects. Duris, the historian and tyrant of Samos, is reported to have patriotically boasted of an epitaph supposedly penned by Pherecydes which declared that Pythagoras&#x27;s wisdom exceeded his own. On the grounds of all these references connecting Pythagoras with Pherecydes, Riedweg concludes that there may well be some historical foundation to the tradition that Pherecydes was Pythagoras&#x27;s teacher. Pythagoras and Pherecydes also appear to have shared similar views on the soul and the teaching of metempsychosis.

Before 520 BC, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, Pythagoras might have met Thales of Miletus, who would have been around fifty-four years older than him. Thales was a philosopher, scientist, mathematician, and engineer, also known for a special case of the inscribed angle theorem. Pythagoras&#x27;s birthplace, the island of Samos, is situated in the Northeast Aegean Sea not far from Miletus. Diogenes Laërtius cites a statement from Aristoxenus (fourth century BC) stating that Pythagoras learned most of his moral doctrines from the Delphic priestess Themistoclea. Porphyry agrees with this assertion but calls the priestess Aristoclea (&quot;Aristokleia&quot;). Ancient authorities furthermore note the similarities between the religious and ascetic peculiarities of Pythagoras with the Orphic or Cretan mysteries, or the Delphic oracle.

=== In Croton ===
Porphyry repeats an account from Antiphon, who reported that, while he was still on Samos, Pythagoras founded a school known as the &quot;semicircle&quot;. Here, Samians debated matters of public concern. Supposedly, the school became so renowned that the brightest minds in all of Greece came to Samos to hear Pythagoras teach. Pythagoras himself dwelled in a secret cave, where he studied in private and occasionally held discourses with a few of his close friends. Christoph Riedweg, a German scholar of early Pythagoreanism, states that it is entirely possible Pythagoras may have taught on Samos, but cautions that Antiphon&#x27;s account, which makes reference to a specific building that was still in use during his own time, appears to be motivated by Samian patriotic interest.

Around 530 BC, when Pythagoras was about forty years old, he left Samos. His later admirers claimed that he left because he disagreed with the tyranny of Polycrates in Samos; Riedweg notes that this explanation closely aligns with Nicomachus&#x27;s emphasis on Pythagoras&#x27;s purported love of freedom, but that Pythagoras&#x27;s enemies portrayed him as having a proclivity towards tyranny. Other accounts claim that Pythagoras left Samos because he was so overburdened with public duties in Samos, because of the high estimation in which he was held by his fellow-citizens. He arrived in the Greek colony of Croton (today&#x27;s Crotone, in Calabria) in what was then Magna Graecia. All sources agree that Pythagoras was charismatic and quickly acquired great political influence in his new environment. He served as an advisor to the elites in Croton and gave them frequent advice. Later biographers tell fantastical stories of the effects of his eloquent speeches in leading the people of Croton to abandon their luxurious and corrupt way of life and devote themselves to the purer system which he came to introduce.

=== Family and friends ===
Diogenes Laërtius states that Pythagoras &quot;did not indulge in the pleasures of love&quot; and that he cautioned others to only have sex &quot;whenever you are willing to be weaker than yourself&quot;. According to Porphyry, Pythagoras married Theano, a lady of Crete and the daughter of Pythenax and had several children with her. Porphyry writes that Pythagoras had two sons named Telauges and Arignote, and a daughter named Myia, who &quot;took precedence among the maidens in Croton and, when a wife, among married women.&quot; Iamblichus mentions none of these children and instead only mentions a son named Mnesarchus after his grandfather. This son was raised by Pythagoras&#x27;s appointed successor Aristaeus and eventually took over the school when Aristaeus was too old to continue running it. Suda writes that Pythagoras had 4 children (Telauges, Mnesarchus, Myia and Arignote).

The wrestler Milo of Croton was said to have been a close associate of Pythagoras and was credited with having saved the philosopher&#x27;s life when a roof was about to collapse. This association may have been the result of confusion with a different man named Pythagoras, who was an athletics trainer. Diogenes Laërtius records Milo&#x27;s wife&#x27;s name as Myia. Iamblichus mentions Theano as the wife of Brontinus of Croton. Diogenes Laërtius states that the same Theano was Pythagoras&#x27;s pupil and that Pythagoras&#x27;s wife Theano was her daughter. Diogenes Laërtius also records that works supposedly written by Theano were still extant during his own lifetime and quotes several opinions attributed to her. These writings are now known to be pseudepigraphical.

=== Death ===
Pythagoras&#x27;s emphasis on dedication and asceticism are credited with aiding in Croton&#x27;s decisive victory over the neighboring colony of Sybaris in 510 BC. After the victory, some prominent citizens of Croton proposed a democratic constitution, which the Pythagoreans rejected. The supporters of democracy, headed by Cylon and Ninon, the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from Pythagoras&#x27;s brotherhood, roused the populace against them. Followers of Cylon and Ninon attacked the Pythagoreans during one of their meetings, either in the house of Milo or in some other meeting-place. Accounts of the attack are often contradictory and many probably confused it with the later anti-Pythagorean rebellions, such as the one in Metapontum in 454 BC. The building was apparently set on fire, and many of the assembled members perished; only the younger and more active members managed to escape.

Sources disagree regarding whether Pythagoras was present when the attack occurred and, if he was, whether or not he managed to escape. In some accounts, Pythagoras was not at the meeting when the Pythagoreans were attacked because he was on Delos tending to the dying Pherecydes. According to another account from Dicaearchus, Pythagoras was at the meeting and managed to escape, leading a small group of followers to the nearby city of Locris, where they pleaded for sanctuary, but were denied. They reached the city of Metapontum, where they took shelter in the temple of the Muses and died there of starvation after forty days without food. Another tale recorded by Porphyry claims that, as Pythagoras&#x27;s enemies were burning the house, his devoted students laid down on the ground to make a path for him to escape by walking over their bodies across the flames like a bridge. Pythagoras managed to escape, but was so despondent at the deaths of his beloved students that he committed suicide. A different legend reported by both Diogenes Laërtius and Iamblichus states that Pythagoras almost managed to escape, but that he came to a fava bean field and refused to run through it, since doing so would violate his teachings, so he stopped instead and was killed. This story seems to have originated from the writer Neanthes, who told it about later Pythagoreans, not about Pythagoras himself.

== Teachings ==
=== Metempsychosis ===
Although the exact details of Pythagoras&#x27;s teachings are uncertain, it is possible to reconstruct a general outline of his main ideas. Aristotle writes at length about the teachings of the Pythagoreans, but without mentioning Pythagoras directly. One of Pythagoras&#x27;s main doctrines appears to have been &quot;metempsychosis&quot;, the belief that all souls are immortal and that, after death, a soul is transferred into a new body. This teaching is referenced by Xenophanes, Ion of Chios, and Herodotus. Nothing whatsoever, however, is known about the nature or mechanism by which Pythagoras believed metempsychosis to occur.

Empedocles alludes in one of his poems that Pythagoras may have claimed to possess the ability to recall his former incarnations. Diogenes Laërtius reports an account from Heraclides Ponticus that Pythagoras told people that he had lived four previous lives that he could remember in detail. The first of these lives was as Aethalides the son of Hermes, who granted him the ability to remember all his past incarnations. Next, he was incarnated as Euphorbus, a minor hero from the Trojan War briefly mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. He then became the philosopher Hermotimus, who recognized the shield of Euphorbus in the temple of Apollo. His final incarnation was as Pyrrhus, a fisherman from Delos. One of his past lives, as reported by Dicaearchus, was as a beautiful courtesan.

=== Mysticism ===
Another belief attributed to Pythagoras was that of the &quot;harmony of the spheres&quot;, which maintained that the planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, which correspond to musical notes and thus produce an inaudible symphony. According to Porphyry, Pythagoras taught that the seven Muses were actually the seven planets singing together. In his philosophical dialogue &quot;Protrepticus&quot;, Aristotle has his literary double say:

Pythagoras was said to have practiced divination and prophecy. The earliest mentions of divination by isopsephy in Greek literature associate it with Pythagoras; he was viewed as the founder of this practice. According to his biographer, Iamblichus, he taught his method of divination to a Scythian priest of Apollo by the name of Abaris the Hyperborean:

This shouldn&#x27;t be confused with a simplified version known today as &quot;Pythagorean numerology&quot;, involving a variant of an isopsephic technique known – among other names – as or , by means of which the base values of letters in a word were mathematically reduced by addition or division, in order to obtain a single value from one to nine for the whole name or word; these &#x27;roots&#x27; or &#x27;base numbers&#x27; could then be interpreted with other techniques, such as traditional Pythagorean attributions. This latter form of numerology flourished during the Byzantine era, and was first attested among the Gnostics of the second century AD. By that time, isopsephy had developed into several different techniques that were used for a variety of purposes; including divination, doctrinal allegory, and medical prognosis and treatment.

In the visits to various places in Greece—Delos, Sparta, Phlius, Crete, etc.—which are ascribed to him, he usually appears either in his religious or priestly guise, or else as a lawgiver.

=== Numerology ===


According to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans used mathematics for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application. They believed that all things were made of numbers. The number one (the monad) represented the origin of all things and the number two (the dyad) represented matter. The number three was an &quot;ideal number&quot; because it had a beginning, middle, and end and was the smallest number of points that could be used to define a plane triangle, which they revered as a symbol of the god Apollo. The number four signified the four seasons and the four elements. The number seven was also sacred because it was the number of planets and the number of strings on a lyre, and because Apollo&#x27;s birthday was celebrated on the seventh day of each month. They believed that odd numbers were masculine, that even numbers were feminine, and that the number five represented marriage, because it was the sum of two and three.

Ten was regarded as the &quot;perfect number&quot; and the Pythagoreans honored it by never gathering in groups larger than ten. Pythagoras was credited with devising the tetractys, the triangular figure of four rows which add up to the perfect number, ten. The Pythagoreans regarded the tetractys as a symbol of utmost mystical importance. Iamblichus, in his &quot;Life of Pythagoras&quot;, states that the tetractys was &quot;so admirable, and so divinised by those who understood [it],&quot; that Pythagoras&#x27;s students would swear oaths by it. Andrew Gregory concludes that the tradition linking Pythagoras to the tetractys is probably genuine.

Modern scholars debate whether these numerological teachings were developed by Pythagoras himself or by the later Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus of Croton. In his landmark study &quot;Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism&quot;, Walter Burkert argues that Pythagoras was a charismatic political and religious teacher, but that the number philosophy attributed to him was really an innovation by Philolaus. According to Burkert, Pythagoras never dealt with numbers at all, let alone made any noteworthy contribution to mathematics. Burkert argues that the only mathematics the Pythagoreans ever actually engaged in was simple, proofless arithmetic, but that these arithmetic discoveries did contribute significantly to the beginnings of mathematics.

== Pythagoreanism ==
=== Communal lifestyle ===
Both Plato and Isocrates state that, above all else, Pythagoras was known as the founder of a new way of life. The organization Pythagoras founded at Croton was called a &quot;school&quot;, but, in many ways, resembled a monastery. The adherents were bound by a vow to Pythagoras and each other, for the purpose of pursuing the religious and ascetic observances, and of studying his religious and philosophical theories. The members of the sect shared all their possessions in common and were devoted to each other to the exclusion of outsiders. Ancient sources record that the Pythagoreans ate meals in common after the manner of the Spartans. One Pythagorean maxim was &quot;koinà tà phílōn&quot; (&quot;All things in common among friends&quot;). Both Iamblichus and Porphyry provide detailed accounts of the organization of the school, although the primary interest of both writers is not historical accuracy, but rather to present Pythagoras as a divine figure, sent by the gods to benefit mankind. Iamblichus, in particular, presents the &quot;Pythagorean Way of Life&quot; as a pagan alternative to the Christian monastic communities of his own time. For Pythagoreans, the highest reward humans could attain was for their soul to join in the life of the gods and thus escape the cycle of reincarnation. Two groups existed within early Pythagoreanism: the &quot;mathematikoi&quot; (&quot;learners&quot;) and the &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; (&quot;listeners&quot;). The &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; are traditionally identified by scholars as &quot;old believers&quot; in mysticism, numerology, and religious teachings; whereas the &quot;mathematikoi&quot; are traditionally identified as a more intellectual, modernist faction who were more rationalist and scientific. Gregory cautions that there was probably not a sharp distinction between them and that many Pythagoreans probably believed the two approaches were compatible. The study of mathematics and music may have been connected to the worship of Apollo. The Pythagoreans believed that music was a purification for the soul, just as medicine was a purification for the body. One anecdote of Pythagoras reports that when he encountered some drunken youths trying to break into the home of a virtuous woman, he sang a solemn tune with long spondees and the boys&#x27; &quot;raging willfulness&quot; was quelled. The Pythagoreans also placed particular emphasis on the importance of physical exercise; therapeutic dancing, daily morning walks along scenic routes, and athletics were major components of the Pythagorean lifestyle. Moments of contemplation at the beginning and end of each day were also advised.

=== Prohibitions and regulations ===
Pythagorean teachings were known as &quot;symbols&quot; (&quot;symbola&quot;) and members took a vow of silence that they would not reveal these symbols to non-members. Those who did not obey the laws of the community were expelled and the remaining members would erect tombstones for them as though they had died. A number of &quot;oral sayings&quot; (&quot;akoúsmata&quot;) attributed to Pythagoras have survived, dealing with how members of the Pythagorean community should perform sacrifices, how they should honor the gods, how they should &quot;move from here&quot;, and how they should be buried. Many of these sayings emphasize the importance of ritual purity and avoiding defilement. For instance, a saying which Leonid Zhmud concludes can probably be genuinely traced back to Pythagoras himself forbids his followers from wearing woolen garments. Other extant oral sayings forbid Pythagoreans from breaking bread, poking fires with swords, or picking up crumbs and teach that a person should always put the right sandal on before the left. The exact meanings of these sayings, however, are frequently obscure. Iamblichus preserves Aristotle&#x27;s descriptions of the original, ritualistic intentions behind a few of these sayings, but these apparently later fell out of fashion, because Porphyry provides markedly different ethical-philosophical interpretations of them:

New initiates were allegedly not permitted to meet Pythagoras until after they had completed a five-year initiation period, during which they were required to remain silent. Sources indicate that Pythagoras himself was unusually progressive in his attitudes towards women and female members of Pythagoras&#x27;s school appear to have played an active role in its operations. Iamblichus provides a list of 235 famous Pythagoreans, seventeen of whom are women. In later times, many prominent female philosophers contributed to the development of Neopythagoreanism.

Pythagoreanism also entailed a number of dietary prohibitions. It is more or less agreed that Pythagoras issued a prohibition against the consumption of fava beans and the meat of non-sacrificial animals such as fish and poultry. Both of these assumptions, however, have been contradicted. Pythagorean dietary restrictions may have been motivated by belief in the doctrine of metempsychosis. Some ancient writers present Pythagoras as enforcing a strictly vegetarian diet. Eudoxus of Cnidus, a student of Archytas, writes, &quot;Pythagoras was distinguished by such purity and so avoided killing and killers that he not only abstained from animal foods, but even kept his distance from cooks and hunters.&quot; Other authorities contradict this statement. According to Aristoxenus, Pythagoras allowed the use of all kinds of animal food except the flesh of oxen used for ploughing, and rams. According to Heraclides Ponticus, Pythagoras ate the meat from sacrifices and established a diet for athletes dependent on meat.

== Legends ==
Within his own lifetime, Pythagoras was already the subject of elaborate hagiographic legends. Aristotle described Pythagoras as a wonder-worker and somewhat of a supernatural figure. In a fragment, Aristotle writes that Pythagoras had a golden thigh, which he publicly exhibited at the Olympic Games and showed to Abaris the Hyperborean as proof of his identity as the &quot;Hyperborean Apollo&quot;. Supposedly, the priest of Apollo gave Pythagoras a magic arrow, which he used to fly over long distances and perform ritual purifications. He was supposedly once seen at both Metapontum and Croton at the same time. When Pythagoras crossed the river Kosas (the modern-day Basento), &quot;several witnesses&quot; reported that they heard it greet him by name. In Roman times, a legend claimed that Pythagoras was the son of Apollo. According to Muslim tradition, Pythagoras was said to have been initiated by Hermes (Egyptian Thoth).

Pythagoras was said to have dressed all in white. He is also said to have borne a golden wreath atop his head and to have worn trousers after the fashion of the Thracians. Diogenes Laërtius presents Pythagoras as having exercised remarkable self-control; he was always cheerful, but &quot;abstained wholly from laughter, and from all such indulgences as jests and idle stories&quot;. Pythagoras was said to have had extraordinary success in dealing with animals. A fragment from Aristotle records that, when a deadly snake bit Pythagoras, he bit it back and killed it. Both Porphyry and Iamblichus report that Pythagoras once persuaded a bull not to eat fava beans and that he once convinced a notoriously destructive bear to swear that it would never harm a living thing again, and that the bear kept its word.

Riedweg suggests that Pythagoras may have personally encouraged these legends, but Gregory states that there is no direct evidence of this. Anti-Pythagorean legends were also circulated. Diogenes Laërtes retells a story told by Hermippus of Samos, which states that Pythagoras had once gone into an underground room, telling everyone that he was descending to the underworld. He stayed in this room for months, while his mother secretly recorded everything that happened during his absence. After he returned from this room, Pythagoras recounted everything that had happened while he was gone, convincing everyone that he had really been in the underworld and leading them to trust him with their wives.

== Attributed discoveries ==
=== In mathematics ===
Although Pythagoras is most famous today for his alleged mathematical discoveries, classical historians dispute whether he himself ever actually made any significant contributions to the field. Many mathematical and scientific discoveries were attributed to Pythagoras, including his famous theorem, as well as discoveries in the fields of music, astronomy, and medicine. Since at least the first century BC, Pythagoras has commonly been given credit for discovering the Pythagorean theorem, a theorem in geometry that states that &quot;in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal [to the sum of] the squares of the two other sides&quot;—that is, formula_1. According to a popular legend, after he discovered this theorem, Pythagoras sacrificed an ox, or possibly even a whole &quot;hecatomb&quot;, to the gods. Cicero rejected this story as spurious because of the much more widely held belief that Pythagoras forbade blood sacrifices. Porphyry attempted to explain the story by asserting that the ox was actually made of dough.

The Pythagorean theorem was known and used by the Babylonians and Indians centuries before Pythagoras, but he may have been the first to introduce it to the Greeks. Some historians of mathematics have even suggested that he—or his students—may have constructed the first proof. Burkert rejects this suggestion as implausible, noting that Pythagoras was never credited with having proved any theorem in antiquity. Furthermore, the manner in which the Babylonians employed Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) cuneiform sources. Pythagoras&#x27;s biographers state that he also was the first to identify the five regular solids and that he was the first to discover the Theory of Proportions.

=== In music ===
According to legend, Pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations when he passed blacksmiths at work one day and heard the sound of their hammers clanging against the anvils. Thinking that the sounds of the hammers were beautiful and harmonious, except for one, he rushed into the blacksmith shop and began testing the hammers. He then realized that the tune played when the hammer struck was directly proportional to the size of the hammer and therefore concluded that music was mathematical.

=== In astronomy ===
In ancient times, Pythagoras and his contemporary Parmenides of Elea were both credited with having been the first to teach that the Earth was spherical, the first to divide the globe into five climatic zones, and the first to identify the morning star and the evening star as the same celestial object (now known as Venus). Of the two philosophers, Parmenides has a much stronger claim to having been the first and the attribution of these discoveries to Pythagoras seems to have possibly originated from a pseudepigraphal poem. Empedocles, who lived in Magna Graecia shortly after Pythagoras and Parmenides, knew that the earth was spherical. By the end of the fifth century BC, this fact was universally accepted among Greek intellectuals. The identity of the morning star and evening star was known to the Babylonians over a thousand years earlier.

== Later influence in antiquity ==
=== On Greek philosophy ===

Sizeable Pythagorean communities existed in Magna Graecia, Phlius, and Thebes during the early fourth century BC. Around the same time, the Pythagorean philosopher Archytas was highly influential on the politics of the city of Tarentum in Magna Graecia. According to later tradition, Archytas was elected as &quot;strategos&quot; (&quot;general&quot;) seven times, even though others were prohibited from serving more than a year. Archytas was also a renowned mathematician and musician. He was a close friend of Plato and he is quoted in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. Aristotle states that the philosophy of Plato was heavily dependent on the teachings of the Pythagoreans. Cicero repeats this statement, remarking that &quot;Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia&quot; (&quot;They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean&quot;). According to Charles H. Kahn, Plato&#x27;s middle dialogues, including &quot;Meno&quot;, &quot;Phaedo&quot;, and &quot;The Republic&quot;, have a strong &quot;Pythagorean coloring&quot;, and his last few dialogues (particularly &quot;Philebus&quot; and &quot;Timaeus&quot;) are extremely Pythagorean in character.

According to R. M. Hare, Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; may be partially based on the &quot;tightly organised community of like-minded thinkers&quot; established by Pythagoras at Croton. Additionally, Plato may have borrowed from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and abstract thought are a secure basis for philosophy, science, and morality. Plato and Pythagoras shared a &quot;mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world&quot; and both were probably influenced by Orphism. The historian of philosophy Frederick Copleston states that Plato probably borrowed his tripartite theory of the soul from the Pythagoreans. Bertrand Russell, in his &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot;, contends that the influence of Pythagoras on Plato and others was so great that he should be considered the most influential philosopher of all time. He concludes that &quot;I do not know of any other man who has been as influential as he was in the school of thought.&quot;

A revival of Pythagorean teachings occurred in the first century BC when Middle Platonist philosophers such as Eudorus and Philo of Alexandria hailed the rise of a &quot;new&quot; Pythagoreanism in Alexandria. At around the same time, Neopythagoreanism became prominent. The first-century AD philosopher Apollonius of Tyana sought to emulate Pythagoras and live by Pythagorean teachings. The later first-century Neopythagorean philosopher Moderatus of Gades expanded on Pythagorean number philosophy and probably understood the soul as a &quot;kind of mathematical harmony&quot;. The Neopythagorean mathematician and musicologist Nicomachus likewise expanded on Pythagorean numerology and music theory. Numenius of Apamea interpreted Plato&#x27;s teachings in light of Pythagorean doctrines.

=== On art and architecture ===
Greek sculpture sought to represent the permanent reality behind superficial appearances. Early Archaic sculpture represents life in simple forms, and may have been influenced by the earliest Greek natural philosophies. The Greeks generally believed that nature expressed itself in ideal forms and was represented by a type (), which was mathematically calculated. When dimensions changed, architects sought to relay permanence through mathematics. Maurice Bowra believes that these ideas influenced the theory of Pythagoras and his students, who believed that &quot;all things are numbers&quot;.

During the sixth century BC, the number philosophy of the Pythagoreans triggered a revolution in Greek sculpture. Greek sculptors and architects attempted to find the mathematical relation (canon) behind aesthetic perfection. Possibly drawing on the ideas of Pythagoras, the sculptor Polykleitos wrote in his &quot;Canon&quot; that beauty consists in the proportion, not of the elements (materials), but of the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. In the Greek architectural orders, every element was calculated and constructed by mathematical relations. Rhys Carpenter states that the ratio 2:1 was &quot;the generative ratio of the Doric order, and in Hellenistic times an ordinary Doric colonnade, beats out a rhythm of notes.&quot;

The oldest known building designed according to Pythagorean teachings is the Porta Maggiore Basilica, a subterranean basilica which was built during the reign of the Roman emperor Nero as a secret place of worship for Pythagoreans. The basilica was built underground because of the Pythagorean emphasis on secrecy and also because of the legend that Pythagoras had sequestered himself in a cave on Samos. The basilica&#x27;s apse is in the east and its atrium in the west out of respect for the rising sun. It has a narrow entrance leading to a small pool where the initiates could purify themselves. The building is also designed according to Pythagorean numerology, with each table in the sanctuary providing seats for seven people. Three aisles lead to a single altar, symbolizing the three parts of the soul approaching the unity of Apollo. The apse depicts a scene of the poet Sappho leaping off the Leucadian cliffs, clutching her lyre to her breast, while Apollo stands beneath her, extending his right hand in a gesture of protection, symbolizing Pythagorean teachings about the immortality of the soul. The interior of the sanctuary is almost entirely white because the color white was regarded by Pythagoreans as sacred.

The emperor Hadrian&#x27;s Pantheon in Rome was also built based on Pythagorean numerology. The temple&#x27;s circular plan, central axis, hemispherical dome, and alignment with the four cardinal directions symbolize Pythagorean views on the order of the universe. The single oculus at the top of the dome symbolizes the monad and the sun-god Apollo. The twenty-eight ribs extending from the oculus symbolize the moon, because twenty-eight was the same number of months on the Pythagorean lunar calendar. The five coffered rings beneath the ribs represent the marriage of the sun and moon.

=== In early Christianity ===
Many early Christians had a deep respect for Pythagoras. Eusebius ( AD), bishop of Caesarea, praises Pythagoras in his &quot;Against Hierokles&quot; for his rule of silence, his frugality, his &quot;extraordinary&quot; morality, and his wise teachings. In another work, Eusebius compares Pythagoras to Moses. In one of his letters, the Church Father Jerome ( AD) praises Pythagoras for his wisdom and, in another letter, he credits Pythagoras for his belief in the immortality of the soul, which he suggests Christians inherited from him. Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD) rejected Pythagoras&#x27;s teaching of metempsychosis without explicitly naming him, but otherwise expressed admiration for him. In &quot;On the Trinity&quot;, Augustine lauds the fact that Pythagoras was humble enough to call himself a &quot;philosophos&quot; or &quot;lover of wisdom&quot; rather than a &quot;sage&quot;. In another passage, Augustine defends Pythagoras&#x27;s reputation, arguing that Pythagoras certainly never taught the doctrine of metempsychosis.

== Influence after antiquity ==
=== In the Middle Ages ===
During the Middle Ages, Pythagoras was revered as the founder of mathematics and music, two of the Seven Liberal Arts. He appears in numerous medieval depictions, in illuminated manuscripts and in the relief sculptures on the portal of the Cathedral of Chartres. The &quot;Timaeus&quot; was the only dialogue of Plato to survive in Latin translation in western Europe, which led William of Conches (c. 1080–1160) to declare that Plato was Pythagorean. A large-scale translation movement emerged during the Abbasid Caliphate, translating many Greek texts into Arabic. Works ascribed to Pythagoras included the &quot;Golden Verses&quot; and snippets of his scientific and mathematical theories. By translating and disseminating Pythagorean texts, Islamic scholars ensured their survival and wider accessibility. This preserved knowledge that might have otherwise been lost through the decline of the Roman Empire and the neglect of classical learning in Europe. In the 1430s, the Camaldolese friar Ambrose Traversari translated Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot; from Greek into Latin and, in the 1460s, the philosopher Marsilio Ficino translated Porphyry and Iamblichus&#x27;s &quot;Lives of Pythagoras&quot; into Latin as well, thereby allowing them to be read and studied by western scholars. In 1494, the Greek Neopythagorean scholar Constantine Lascaris published &quot;The Golden Verses of Pythagoras&quot;, translated into Latin, with a printed edition of his &quot;Grammatica&quot;, thereby bringing them to a widespread audience. In 1499, he published the first Renaissance biography of Pythagoras in his work &quot;Vitae illustrium philosophorum siculorum et calabrorum&quot;, issued in Messina.

=== On modern science ===
In his preface to his book &quot;On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres&quot; (1543), Nicolaus Copernicus cites various Pythagoreans as the most important influences on the development of his heliocentric model of the universe, deliberately omitting mention of Aristarchus of Samos, a non-Pythagorean astronomer who had developed a fully heliocentric model in the fourth century BC, in effort to portray his model as fundamentally Pythagorean. Johannes Kepler considered himself to be a Pythagorean. He believed in the Pythagorean doctrine of &quot;musica universalis&quot; and it was his search for the mathematical equations behind this doctrine that led to his discovery of the laws of planetary motion. Kepler titled his book on the subject &quot;Harmonices Mundi&quot; (&quot;Harmonics of the World&quot;), after the Pythagorean teaching that had inspired him. Near the conclusion of the book, Kepler describes himself falling asleep to the sound of the heavenly music, &quot;warmed by having drunk a generous draught... from the cup of Pythagoras.&quot; He also called Pythagoras the &quot;grandfather&quot; of all Copernicans.

Isaac Newton firmly believed in the Pythagorean teaching of the mathematical harmony and order of the universe. Though Newton was notorious for rarely giving others credit for their discoveries, he attributed the discovery of the Law of Universal Gravitation to Pythagoras. Albert Einstein believed that a scientist may also be &quot;a Platonist or a Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research.&quot; The English philosopher Alfred North Whitehead argued that &quot;In a sense, Plato and Pythagoras stand nearer to modern physical science than does Aristotle. The two former were mathematicians, whereas Aristotle was the son of a doctor&quot;. By this measure, Whitehead declared that Einstein and other modern scientists like him are &quot;following the pure Pythagorean tradition.&quot;

=== On vegetarianism ===
A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, in which he delivers a speech imploring his followers to adhere to a strictly vegetarian diet. It was through Arthur Golding&#x27;s 1567 English translation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period. John Donne&#x27;s &quot;Progress of the Soul&quot; discusses the implications of the doctrines expounded in the speech, and Michel de Montaigne quoted the speech no less than three times in his treatise &quot;Of Cruelty&quot; to voice his moral objections against the mistreatment of animals. William Shakespeare references the speech in his play &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. John Dryden included a translation of the scene with Pythagoras in his 1700 work &quot;Fables, Ancient and Modern&quot;, and John Gay&#x27;s 1726 fable &quot;Pythagoras and the Countryman&quot; reiterates its major themes, linking carnivorism with tyranny. Lord Chesterfield records that his conversion to vegetarianism had been motivated by reading Pythagoras&#x27;s speech in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Until the word &quot;vegetarianism&quot; was coined in the 1840s, vegetarians were referred to in English as &quot;Pythagoreans&quot;. Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote an ode entitled &quot;To the Pythagorean Diet&quot;, and Leo Tolstoy adopted the Pythagorean diet himself.

=== On Western esotericism ===
Early modern European esotericism drew heavily on the teachings of Pythagoras. The German humanist scholar Johannes Reuchlin (1455–1522) synthesized Pythagoreanism with Christian theology and Jewish Kabbalah, arguing that Kabbalah and Pythagoreanism were both inspired by Mosaic tradition and that Pythagoras was therefore a kabbalist. In his dialogue &quot;De verbo mirifico&quot; (1494), Reuchlin compared the Pythagorean tetractys to the ineffable divine name YHWH, ascribing each of the four letters of the tetragrammaton a symbolic meaning according to Pythagorean mystical teachings.

Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa&#x27;s popular and influential three-volume treatise &quot;De Occulta Philosophia&quot; cites Pythagoras as a &quot;religious magi&quot; and advances the idea that Pythagoras&#x27;s mystical numerology operates on a supercelestial level, a religious term used to describe a high heavenly realm used during his time. The freemasons deliberately modeled their society on the community founded by Pythagoras at Croton. Rosicrucianism used Pythagorean symbolism, as did Robert Fludd (1574–1637), who believed his own musical writings to have been inspired by Pythagoras. John Dee was heavily influenced by Pythagorean ideology, particularly the teaching that all things are made of numbers. Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati, was a strong admirer of Pythagoras and, in his book &quot;Pythagoras&quot; (1787), he advocated that society should be reformed to be more like Pythagoras&#x27;s commune at Croton. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart incorporated Masonic and Pythagorean symbolism into his opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. Sylvain Maréchal, in his six-volume 1799 biography &quot;The Voyages of Pythagoras&quot;, declared that all revolutionaries in all time periods are the &quot;heirs of Pythagoras&quot;.

=== On literature ===
Dante Alighieri was fascinated by Pythagorean numerology and based his descriptions of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven on Pythagorean numbers. Dante wrote that Pythagoras saw Unity as Good and Plurality as Evil and, in &quot;Paradiso&quot; XV, 56–57, he declares: &quot;five and six, if understood, ray forth from unity&quot;. The number eleven and its multiples are found throughout the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, each book of which has thirty-three cantos, except for the &quot;Inferno&quot;, which has thirty-four, the first of which serves as a general introduction. Dante describes the ninth and tenth bolgias in the Eighth Circle of Hell as being twenty-two miles and eleven miles respectively, which correspond to the fraction , which was the Pythagorean approximation of pi.

The Transcendentalists read the ancient &quot;Lives of Pythagoras&quot; as guides on how to live a model life. Henry David Thoreau was impacted by Thomas Taylor&#x27;s translations of Iamblichus&#x27;s &quot;Life of Pythagoras&quot; and Stobaeus&#x27;s &quot;Pythagoric Sayings&quot; and his views on nature may have been influenced by the Pythagorean idea of images corresponding to archetypes. The Pythagorean teaching of &quot;musica universalis&quot; is a recurring theme throughout Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Walden&quot;.

<doc id="23279" wikidata="Q1193211" url="?curid=23279" title="The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch">
<text>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch is a 1964 science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1965. Like many of Dick&#x27;s novels, it utilizes an array of science fiction concepts and explores the ambiguous slippage between reality and unreality. It is one of Dick&#x27;s first works to explore religious themes.

The novel takes place in a future 2016 where humankind has colonized every habitable planet and moon in the Solar System. To cope with the difficult life away from Earth, colonists rely on the illegal hallucinogen Can-D, secretly distributed by corporate head Leo Bulero. New tensions arise with the rumor that merchant explorer Palmer Eldritch has returned from an expedition in possession of a new alien hallucinogen to compete with Can-D.

==Plot summary==
The story begins in a future world where global temperatures have risen so high that in most of the world it is unsafe to be outside without special cooling gear during daylight hours. In a desperate bid to preserve humanity and ease population burdens on Earth, the UN has initiated a &quot;draft&quot; for colonizing the nearby planets, where conditions are so horrific and primitive that the unwilling colonists have fallen prey to a form of escapism involving the use of an illegal drug (Can-D) in concert with &quot;layouts&quot;. Layouts are physical props intended to simulate a sort of alternative reality where life is easier than either the grim existence of the colonists in their marginal off-world colonies, or even Earth, where global warming has progressed to the point that Antarctica is prime vacation resort territory. The illegal drug Can-D allows people to &quot;share&quot; their experience of the &quot;Perky Pat&quot; (the name of the main female character in the simulated world) layouts. This &quot;sharing&quot; has caused a pseudo-religious cult or series of cults to grow up around the layouts and the use of the drug.

Up to the point where the novel begins, New York City-based Perky Pat (or P.P.) Layouts, Inc., has held a monopoly on this product, as well as on the illegal trade in the drug Can-D which makes the shared hallucinations possible.

The novel opens shortly after Barney Mayerson, P.P. Layouts&#x27; top precog, has received a &quot;draft notice&quot; from the UN for involuntary resettlement as a colonist on Mars. Mayerson is sleeping with his assistant, Roni Fugate, but remains conflicted about the divorce, which he himself initiated, from his first wife Emily, a ceramic pot artist. Meanwhile, Emily&#x27;s second husband tries to sell her pot designs to P.P. Layouts as possible accessories for the Perky Pat virtual worlds—but Barney, recognizing them as Emily&#x27;s, rejects them out of spite.

Meanwhile, the UN rescues Palmer Eldritch&#x27;s ship from a crash on Pluto. Leo Bulero, head of P.P. Layouts and an &quot;evolved&quot; human (meaning someone who has undergone expensive genetic treatments by a German &quot;doctor&quot; which are supposed to push the client &quot;forward&quot; on an evolutionary scale, and which result in gross physical, as well as mental, modifications), hears rumors that Eldritch discovered an alien hallucinogen in the Prox system with similar properties to Can-D, and that he plans to market it as &quot;Chew-Z&quot;, with UN approval, on off-world colonies. However Chew-Z does not require the prop of the external layouts and seems to have certain undefined qualities that make the use of Chew-Z even more addictive than Can-D has been. This would effectively destroy the need for P.P. Layouts. Bulero tries to contact Eldritch but he is quarantined at a UN hospital. Both Mayerson and Fugate have precognitions of reports that Bulero is going to be responsible for murdering Eldritch.

Under the guise of a reporter, Bulero travels to Eldritch&#x27;s estate on the Moon, where Eldritch holds a press conference. Bulero is kidnapped and forced to take Chew-Z intravenously. He enters a psychic netherworld over which both he and Eldritch seemingly have some control. After wrangling about business with Eldritch, Bulero travels to what appears to be Earth at some time in the not-too-distant future. Evolved humans identify him as a ghost and show him a monument to himself commemorating his role in the death of Eldritch, an &quot;enemy of the Sol System&quot;.

Bulero returns to Earth and fires Mayerson because Mayerson was afraid to travel to the Moon to rescue him. Mayerson, in despair, accepts his UN conscription to Mars but Bulero recruits him as a double agent. Mayerson is to inject himself with a toxin after taking Chew-Z in a plot to deceive the UN into thinking Chew-Z is harmful and cause them to ban it.

On Mars, Mayerson buys some Chew-Z from Eldritch, who appears in holographic form. Mayerson tries to hallucinate a world where he is still with Emily but finds that he does not control his apparent hallucination. Like Bulero, he finds himself in the future. Mayerson arrives in New York two years hence where he speaks with Bulero, Fugate and his future self about the death of Palmer Eldritch.

He also encounters several manifestations of Eldritch, identifiable by their robotic right hand, artificial eyes, and steel teeth. Eldritch offers to help Mayerson become whatever he wants, but is so controlling of the Chew-Z alternative reality that Mayerson ultimately decides he would rather be dead than continue to be manipulated by Eldritch. When a despairing Mayerson chooses death, he finds himself apparently forced into Eldritch&#x27;s body right at the point in the timeline where Bulero is ready to shoot a torpedo at Eldritch&#x27;s ship. It appears that Eldritch&#x27;s plan is to preserve his own life essence housed in Mayerson&#x27;s body while allowing Mayerson himself to die in Eldritch&#x27;s place. Eldritch, meanwhile, intends to live on in Mayerson&#x27;s form and enjoy the simple if arduous life of a Martian colonist. Mayerson, stuck in Eldritch&#x27;s body and mistaken for him, is indeed nearly killed by Bulero in the near future, but before the fatal shot can be fired he is awakened from his Chew-Z trance in the present by Bulero, who has just arrived on Mars.

Bulero is willing to take Mayerson back to Earth but refuses to after learning that Mayerson did not inject himself with the toxin. Mayerson is now confident that Bulero will kill Eldritch, so the sacrifice of taking the toxin in order to ruin Eldritch&#x27;s business is unnecessary, but he does not try to convince Bulero of this. Later, Mayerson discusses his experience with a neo-Christian colonist and they conclude that either Eldritch became a god in the Prox system or some god-like being has taken his place. Mayerson is convinced some aspect of Eldritch is still inside him, and that as long as he refuses to take Chew-Z again, it is Eldritch who will actually be killed by Bulero in the near future; Mayerson is half-resigned, half-hopeful about taking on the life of a Martian colonist without reprieve. Mayerson considers the possibility of Eldritch being what humans have always thought of as a god, but inimical, or perhaps merely an inferior aspect of a bigger and better sort of god.

The novel has an ambiguous ending, with Bulero heading back toward Earth, and apparent proliferation of Eldritch&#x27;s cyborg body &#x27;stigmata&#x27;, which may mean that Bulero is still trapped in Eldritch&#x27;s hallucinatory domain, or that Chew-Z is becoming increasingly popular among Terrans and Martian colonists.

However, the novel is not a continuation (e.g. &quot;What the Dead Men Say&quot; and the novel &quot;Ubik&quot;) or expansion (e.g. the novella and later novel &quot;Vulcan&#x27;s Hammer&quot;) of an earlier and shorter work.

* Precognition as an accepted vocation figures heavily in the plot of Dick&#x27;s short story &quot;The Minority Report&quot; (first published in 1956) and in his 1970 novel &quot;Our Friends from Frolix 8&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
Algis Budrys of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; described the novel as &quot;an important, beautifully controlled, smoothly created book which will twist your mind if you give it the least chance to do so&quot;. He praised Dick&#x27;s accomplishment, saying &quot;the whole creation resonates to the touch of the only present science-fiction writer who could possibly have done it&quot; and characterizes the result as &quot;a witty, sometimes lighthearted, and always fascinating piece of fiction&quot;. Budrys later named the book the best science-fiction novel of his first year as reviewer for the magazine, reporting that others &quot;are calling it some kind of half-conscious failure&quot;.

Weird fiction writer China Mieville listed this book as one of his top weird fiction books of all time, saying &quot;It&#x27;s infuriating to have to choose just one of Dick&#x27;s works – he is the outstanding figure in SF. In the end I went for Stigmata because I remember how I felt when I put it down. Hollow and beaten. I kept thinking: &#x27;That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s finished. Literature has been finished.

In a 2003 retrospective review, sci-fi and fantasy author Michael Moorcock criticized &quot;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch&quot; as thematically &quot;incoherent&quot;, complaining about Dick&#x27;s lack of an &quot;idiosyncratic structure or style&quot;.

Reflecting on the challenges of writing during a personal and spiritual crisis, Philip K. Dick expressed deep ambivalence about the novel. In his 1968 essay &quot;Self Portrait&quot;, he remarked, &quot;I enjoyed writing all of them [...] But this leaves out the most vital of them all: THE 3 STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH. I am afraid of that book; it deals with absolute evil, and I wrote it during a great crisis in my religious beliefs. I decided to write a novel dealing with absolute evil as personified in the form of a &#x27;human&#x27;. When the galleys came from Doubleday I couldn&#x27;t correct them because I could not bear to read the text, and this is still true.&quot;

<text>Time Out of Joint is a science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick, first published in novel form in the United States in 1959. An abridged version was also serialised in the British science fiction magazine &quot;New Worlds Science Fiction&quot; in several installments from December 1959 to February 1960.

The novel epitomizes many of Dick&#x27;s themes with its concerns about the nature of reality and ordinary people in ordinary lives having the world unravel around them. The title is a reference to Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The line is uttered by Hamlet after being visited by his father&#x27;s ghost and learning that his uncle Claudius murdered his father; in short, a shocking supernatural event that fundamentally alters the way Hamlet perceives the state and the universe (&quot;The time is out of joint; O cursed spite!/That ever I was born to set it right!&quot; [I.V.211-2]), much as do several events in the novel.

==Plot summary==
Ragle Gumm lives in the year 1959 in a quiet American town. His unusual profession consists of repeatedly winning the cash prize in a national newspaper contest called &quot;Where Will The Little Green Man Be Next?&quot;. Gumm&#x27;s 1959 has some differences from ours: the Tucker car is in production, AM/FM radios are scarce to non-existent, and Marilyn Monroe is a complete unknown. As the novel opens, strange things begin to happen to Gumm. A soft-drink stand disappears, replaced by a small slip of paper with the words &quot;SOFT-DRINK STAND&quot; printed on it in block letters. Intriguing little pieces of the real 1959 turn up: a magazine article on Marilyn Monroe, a telephone book with non-operational exchanges listed and radios hidden away in someone else&#x27;s house. People with no apparent connection to Gumm, including military pilots using aircraft transceivers, refer to him by name. Few other characters notice these or experience similar anomalies; the sole exception is Gumm&#x27;s supposed brother-in-law, Victor &quot;Vic&quot; Nielson, in whom he confides. A neighborhood woman, Mrs. Keitelbein, invites him to a civil defense class where he sees a model of a futuristic underground military factory. He has the unshakeable feeling he&#x27;s been inside that building many times before.

Confusion gradually mounts for Gumm. His neighbor Bill Black knows far more about these events than he admits, and, observing this, begins worrying: &quot;Suppose Ragle [Gumm] is becoming sane again?&quot; In fact, Gumm does become sane, and the deception surrounding him (erected to protect and exploit him) begins to unravel.

Gumm tries to escape the town and is turned back by Kafkaesque obstructions. He sees a copy of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, with himself on the cover as Man of the Year, in a military uniform, at the factory depicted in the model. He tries a second time to escape, this time with Vic, and succeeds. He learns that his idyllic town is a constructed reality designed to protect him from the frightening fact that he lives on a then-future Earth (circa 1998) that is at war against lunar colonists who are fighting for a permanent lunar settlement, politically independent from Earth.

Gumm has a unique ability to predict where the colonists&#x27; nuclear strikes will be aimed. Previously Gumm did this work for the military, but then he defected to the colonists&#x27; side and planned to secretly emigrate to the Moon. But before this could happen, he began retreating into a fantasy world based largely upon the relatively idyllic surroundings of his extreme youth. He was no longer able to shoulder his responsibility as Earth&#x27;s lone protector from Lunar-launched nuclear offensives. The fake town was thereby created on the ruins of Kemmerer, Wyoming, to accommodate and rationalize his retreat to childhood so that he could continue predicting nuclear strikes in the guise of submitting entries to a harmless newspaper contest and without the ethical qualms involved with being on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of a civil war. While Gumm regressed by himself to a 1950s mindset, the rest of the town with a few exceptions like Black were all put in a similar state artificially, explaining why hardly anyone else could perceive anomalies.

When Gumm finally remembers his true personal history, he decides to emigrate to the Moon after all because he feels that exploration and migration, as basic human impulses, should never be denied to people by any national or planetary government. Vic rejects this belief, referring to the colonists essentially as aggressors and terrorists, and returns to the simulated town - which has lost its &quot;&quot; because of Gumm&#x27;s escape from its environs. The book ends with some hope for peace, because the Lunar colonists are more willing to negotiate than Earth&#x27;s &quot;One Happy World&quot; regime has been telling its citizens.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Time Out of Joint&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #57, and stated that &quot;there are classic moments, as when reality blows a fuse and a soft-drink stand disintegrates before Gumm&#x27;s eyes, leaving only a bit of paper with the words SOFT-DRINK STAND.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Time Out of Joint&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;As usual, Dick&#x27;s deadpan investigation of a paranoid world reveals more than a little of the unreal dimensions of our own &#x27;safe&#x27; environments.&quot;

<text>A Scanner Darkly is a science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick, published in 1977. The semi-autobiographical story is set in a dystopian Orange County, California, in the then-future of June 1994, and includes an extensive portrayal of drug culture and drug use (both recreational and abusive). The novel is one of Dick&#x27;s best-known works and served as the basis for a 2006 film of the same name, directed by Richard Linklater.

==Plot summary==
The protagonist is Bob Arctor, member of a household of drug users, who is also living a double life as an undercover police agent assigned to spy on Arctor&#x27;s household. Arctor shields his identity from those in the drug subculture and from the police. (The requirement that narcotics agents remain anonymous, to avoid collusion and other forms of corruption, becomes a critical plot point late in the book.) While posing as a drug user, Arctor becomes addicted to &quot;Substance D&quot; (also referred to as &quot;Slow Death&quot;, &quot;Death&quot; or &quot;D&quot;), a powerful psychoactive drug. A conflict is Arctor&#x27;s love for Donna, a drug dealer, through whom he intends to identify high-level dealers of Substance D.

When performing his work as an undercover agent, Arctor goes by the name &quot;Fred&quot; and wears a &quot;scramble suit&quot; that conceals his identity from other officers. Then he is able to sit in a police facility and observe his housemates through &quot;holo-scanners&quot;, audio-visual surveillance devices that are placed throughout the house. Arctor&#x27;s use of the drug causes the two hemispheres of his brain to function independently or &quot;compete&quot;. When Arctor sees himself in the videos saved by the scanners, he does not realize that it is him. Through a series of drug and psychological tests, Arctor&#x27;s superiors at work discover that his addiction has made him incapable of performing his job as a narcotics agent. They do not know his identity because he wears the scramble suit, but when his police supervisor suggests to him that he might be Bob Arctor, he is confused and thinks it cannot be possible.

Donna takes Arctor to &quot;New-Path&quot;, a rehabilitation clinic, just as he begins to experience the symptoms of Substance D withdrawal. It is revealed that Donna has been a narcotics agent all along, working as part of a police operation to infiltrate New-Path and determine its funding source. Without his knowledge, Arctor has been selected to penetrate the organization. As part of the rehab program, Arctor is renamed &quot;Bruce&quot; and forced to participate in cruel group-dynamic games, intended to break the will of the patients.

The story ends with Bruce working at a New-Path farming commune, where he is experiencing a serious neurocognitive deficit, after withdrawing from Substance D. Although considered by his handlers to be nothing more than a walking shell of a man, &quot;Bruce&quot; manages to spot rows of blue flowers growing hidden among rows of corn and realizes that the blue flowers are &quot;Mors ontologica&quot;, the source of Substance D. The book ends with Bruce hiding a flower in his shoe to give to his &quot;friends&quot;—undercover police agents posing as recovering addicts at the Santa Ana New-Path facility—on Thanksgiving.

==Autobiographical nature==
&quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; is a fictionalized account of real events, based on Dick&#x27;s experiences in the 1970s drug culture. Dick said in an interview, &quot;Everything in &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; I actually saw.&quot;

Between mid-1970 (when his fourth wife Nancy left him) and mid-1972, Dick lived semi-communally with a rotating group of mostly teenage drug users at his home in Marin County, described in a letter as being located at 707 Hacienda Way, Santa Venetia. Dick explained, &quot;[M]y wife Nancy left me in 1970. I got mixed up with a lot of street people, just to have somebody to fill the house. She left me with a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house and nobody living in it but me. So I just filled it with street people and I got mixed up with a lot of people who were into drugs.&quot;

During this period, the author ceased writing completely and became fully dependent upon amphetamines, which he had been using intermittently for many years. &quot;I did take amphetamines for years in order to be able to—I was able to produce 68 final pages of copy a day,&quot; Dick said.

The character of Donna was inspired by an older teenager who became associated with Dick sometime in 1970; though they never became lovers, the woman was his principal female companion until early 1972, when Dick left for Canada to deliver a speech to a Vancouver science fiction convention. This speech, &quot;The Android and the Human&quot;, served as the basis for many of the recurring themes and motifs in the ensuing novel. Another turning point in this timeframe for Dick is the alleged burglary of his home and theft of his papers.

After delivering &quot;The Android and the Human&quot;, Dick became a participant in X-Kalay (a Canadian Synanon-type recovery program), effortlessly convincing program caseworkers that he was nursing a heroin addiction to do so. Dick&#x27;s recovery program participation was portrayed in the posthumously released book &quot;The Dark Haired Girl&quot; (a collection of letters and journals from this period, most of a romantic nature). It was at X-Kalay, while doing publicity for the facility, that he devised the notion of rehab centers being used to secretly harvest drugs (thus inspiring the book&#x27;s New-Path clinics).

In the afterword, Dick dedicates the book to those of his friends—he includes himself—who had experienced debilitation or death as a result of their drug use. Mirroring the epilogue are the involuntary goodbyes that occur throughout the story—the constant turnover and burn-out of young people that lived with Dick during those years. In the afterword, he states that the novel is about &quot;some people who were punished entirely too much for what they did&quot;, and that &quot;drug misuse is not a disease, it is a decision, like the decision to move out in front of a moving car&quot;.

==Background and publication==
&quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; was one of the few Dick novels to gestate over a long period of time. By February 1973, in an effort to prove that the effects of his amphetamine usage were merely psychosomatic, the newly clean-and-sober author had already prepared a full outline. A first draft was in development by March. This labor was soon supplanted by a new family and the completion of &quot;Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said&quot; (left unfinished in 1970), which was finally released in 1974 and received the prestigious John W. Campbell Award. Additional preoccupations were the mystical experiences of early 1974 that eventually served as a basis for &quot;VALIS&quot; and the &quot;Exegesis&quot; journal; a screenplay for an unproduced film adaptation of 1969&#x27;s &quot;Ubik&quot;; occasional lectures; and the expedited completion of the deferred Roger Zelazny collaboration &quot;Deus Irae&quot; in 1975.

Because of its semi-autobiographical nature, some of &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; was torturous to write. Tessa Dick, Philip&#x27;s wife at the time, once stated that she often found her husband weeping as the sun rose after a night-long writing session. Tessa has given interviews stating that &quot;when he was with me, he wrote &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; [in] under two weeks. But we spent three years rewriting it&quot; and that she was &quot;pretty involved in his writing process [for &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;]&quot;. Tessa stated in a later interview that she &quot;participated in the writing of &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;&quot; and said that she &quot;consider[s] [her]self the silent co-author&quot;. Philip wrote a contract giving Tessa half of all the rights to the novel, which stated that Tessa &quot;participated to a great extent in writing the outline and novel &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; with me, and I owe her one half of all income derived from it&quot;.

There was also the challenge of transmuting the events into &quot;science fiction&quot;, as Dick felt that he could not sell a mainstream or literary novel after several previous failures. Providing invaluable aid in this field was Judy-Lynn del Rey, head of Ballantine Books&#x27; SF division, which had optioned the book. Del Rey suggested the timeline change to 1994 and emphasized the more futuristic elements of the novel, such as the &quot;scramble suit&quot; employed by Fred (which, incidentally, emerged from one of the mystical experiences). Yet much of the dialogue spoken by the characters used hippie slang, dating the events of the novel to their &quot;true&quot; time-frame of 1970–72.

Upon its publication in 1977, &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; was hailed by ALA Booklist as &quot;his best yet!&quot; Brian Aldiss lauded it as &quot;the best book of the year&quot;, while Robert Silverberg praised the novel as &quot;a masterpiece of sorts, full of demonic intensity&quot;, but concluded that &quot;it happens also not to be a very successful novel... a failure, but a stunning failure&quot;. Spider Robinson panned the novel as &quot;sometimes fascinating, sometimes hilarious, [but] usually deadly boring&quot;. Sales were typical for the SF genre in America, but hardcover editions were issued in Europe, where all of Dick&#x27;s works were warmly received. It was nominated for neither the Nebula nor the Hugo Award but was awarded the British version (the BSFA) in 1978 and the French equivalent (Graouilly d&#x27;Or) upon its publication there in 1979. It also was nominated for the Campbell Award in 1978 and placed sixth in the annual Locus poll.

The title of the novel refers to the Biblical phrase &quot;Through a glass, darkly&quot;, from the King James Version of 1 Corinthians 13. Passages from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s play &quot;Faust&quot; are also referred to throughout the novel. The same-titled film by Ingmar Bergman has also been cited as a reference for the book, the film depicting the similar descent into madness and schizophrenia of its lead character portrayed by Harriet Andersson.

<doc id="23282" wikidata="Q617357" url="?curid=23282" title="Ubik">
<text>Ubik ( ) is a 1969 science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick. The story is set in a future 1992 where psychic powers are utilized in corporate espionage, while cryonic technology allows recently deceased people to be maintained in a lengthy state of hibernation. It follows Joe Chip, a technician at a psychic agency who begins to experience strange alterations in reality that can be temporarily reversed by a mysterious store-bought substance called Ubik. This work expands upon characters and concepts previously introduced in the vignette &quot;What the Dead Men Say&quot;.

&quot;Ubik&quot; is one of Dick&#x27;s most acclaimed novels. In 2009, it was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 greatest novels since 1923. In his review for &quot;Time&quot;, critic Lev Grossman described it as &quot;a deeply unsettling existential horror story, a nightmare you&#x27;ll never be sure you&#x27;ve woken up from&quot;.

==Plot==
By the year 1992, humanity has colonized the Moon and psychic powers are common. The protagonist, Joe Chip, is a debt-ridden technician working for Runciter Associates, a &quot;prudence organization&quot; employing &quot;inertials&quot;—people with the ability to negate the powers of telepaths and &quot;precogs&quot;—to enforce the privacy of clients. The company is run by Glen Runciter, assisted by his deceased wife Ella who is kept in a state of &quot;half-life&quot;, a form of cryonic suspension that allows the deceased limited consciousness and ability to communicate. While consulting with Ella, Runciter discovers that her consciousness is being invaded by another half-lifer named Jory Miller.

When business magnate Stanton Mick hires Runciter Associates to secure his lunar facilities from alleged psychic intrusion, Runciter assembles a team of 11 of his best inertials, including recent hire Pat Conley, a mysterious girl with the unique psychic ability to undo events by changing the past. Runciter and Chip travel with the group to Stanton&#x27;s Moon base, where they discover that the assignment is a trap, presumably set by the company&#x27;s main adversary, Ray Hollis, who leads an organization of psychics. A bomb blast apparently kills Runciter without significantly harming the others. They rush back to Earth to place him into half-life, but they cannot establish contact with him so his body is set to be buried.

From the moment of the explosion, the group begins to experience shifts in reality. Many objects they come into contact with (especially cigarettes) are much older than they should be, some being older types of the same object, and are rapidly deteriorating. They gradually find themselves moving into the past, eventually anchoring in 1939. At the same time, they find themselves surrounded by &quot;manifestations&quot; of Runciter; for example, his face appears on their money. As the novel progresses, members of the group one by one begin to feel tired and cold, then suddenly shrivel and die. Chip attempts to make sense of what is happening and discovers two contradictory messages from Runciter, one stating that he is alive and they are dead, and another claiming to have been recorded by him while he was still alive. The latter message advertises Ubik, a store-bought product which can be used to temporarily reverse deterioration and which often appears as a can of aerosol spray. Chip deduces that they may have all died in the blast and are now linked together in half-life, and unsuccessfully tries to get hold of Ubik.

After receiving another message and travelling to Runciter&#x27;s hometown, Chip accuses Conley of working for Hollis and causing the deterioration with her ability, and while he himself is withering away, she confirms this. As she leaves him to die, he is saved by Runciter, who sprays him with Ubik and tells him that the group is indeed in half-life and he himself is alive and trying to help them, although he does not know where Ubik comes from. As Runciter disappears, Jory reveals himself to Chip, telling him that he, not Conley, has now killed off the entire group (including Conley), as he &quot;eats&quot; half-lifers to sustain himself, and that the entire reality they are experiencing is created and maintained by him. However, Chip is temporarily protected from being consumed through the effect of Ubik, and leaves Jory. As he at last begins to deteriorate again, he meets Ella, who saves him by granting him a certificate for a life-long supply of Ubik, and instructs him to stay half-alive and seek cans of Ubik to further assist Runciter after she herself reincarnates. It is implied that Jory has allies in the real world who help him find other half-lifers to consume in order to prolong his own half-life, or that entities like Jory can arise from any collection of half-lifers. Ubik is claimed to have been developed by Ella and several other half-lifers as a defense against Jory.

Each chapter is introduced by a commercial advertising Ubik as a different product serving a specific use. The last chapter is introduced by Ubik claiming that it has created and directed the universe, and that its real name is unknown and unspoken. In this short chapter, Runciter, who is in the &quot;living&quot; world mourning the loss of his best employees, discovers coins showing Chip&#x27;s face, and feels that this is &quot;just the beginning&quot;.

==Interpretation and analysis==

Dick&#x27;s former wife Tessa remarked

Ubik is a metaphor for God. Ubik is all-powerful and all-knowing, and Ubik is everywhere. The spray can is only a form that Ubik takes to make it easy for people to understand it and use it. It is not the substance inside the can that helps them, but rather their faith in the promise that it will help them. 

She also interpreted the ending by writing

Many readers have puzzled over the ending of &quot;Ubik&quot;, when Glen Runciter finds a Joe Chip coin in his pocket. What does it mean? Is Runciter dead? Are Joe Chip and the others alive? Actually, this is meant to tell you that we can&#x27;t be sure of anything in the world that we call &#x27;reality.&#x27; It is possible that they are all dead and in cold pac or that the half-life world can affect the full-life world. It is also possible that they are all alive and dreaming.

Peter Fitting sees parallels between the God-Devil/Life-Death relationship of Ubik and the antagonist&#x27;s consumptive abilities within half-life, and the commercialized industry between psychics and psychic-inhibiting &quot;inertials&quot; which occupies the novel&#x27;s &quot;reality&quot;. Fitting also notes Dick&#x27;s effort to desacralize and commercialize Ubik through the ironic advertising messages which begin each chapter.

==Adaptations and cultural influences==

===Video game===

In 1998, Cryo Interactive Entertainment released &quot;Philip K. Dick&#x27;s Ubik&quot;, a tactical action/strategy video game very loosely based on the book. The game allowed players to act as Joe Chip and train combat squads into missions against the Hollis Corporation. The game was available for PlayStation and for Microsoft Windows and was not a significant commercial success.

===Planned film adaptations===

====Original attempt – Gorin====
In 1974, French film-maker Jean-Pierre Gorin commissioned Dick to write a screenplay based on &quot;Ubik&quot;. Dick completed the screenplay within a month, but Gorin never filmed it. The screenplay was published as &quot;Ubik: The Screenplay&quot; in 1985 () and again in 2008 (). Dick&#x27;s former wife Tessa claims that the published screenplay &quot;has been heavily edited, and others have added material to the screenplay that Phil wrote&quot;, though she suggests that &quot;film producers really ought to take a look at the author&#x27;s own screenplay before embarking upon their journey of interpretation&quot;.

====Dick&#x27;s screenplay====
Dick&#x27;s screenplay features numerous scenes that are not in the novel. According to Tim Powers, a friend of Dick&#x27;s and fellow science fiction writer, in his foreword to &quot;Ubik: The Screenplay&quot;, Dick had an idea for the film that involved &quot;the film itself appearing to undergo a series of reversions: to black-and-white, then to the awkward jerkiness of very early movies, then to a crookedly jammed frame which proceeds to blacken, bubble and melt away, leaving only the white glare of the projection bulb, which in turn deteriorates to leave the theater in darkness, and might almost leave the moviegoer wondering what sort of dilapidated, antique jalopy he&#x27;ll find his car-keys fitting when he goes outside&quot;.

====Pallotta and Celluloid Dreams====
Tommy Pallotta, who produced the film adaptation of Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;, said in an interview in July 2006 that he &quot;still [had] the option for &quot;Ubik&quot;&quot; and wanted to &quot;make a live action feature from it&quot;. In 2007, Dick&#x27;s daughter, Isa Dick Hackett, said that the film adaptation of &quot;Ubik&quot; was at an advanced stage of negotiations. In May 2008, the film was optioned by Celluloid Dreams, to be produced by Hengameh Panahi for Celluloid Dreams and Isa Dick Hackett for Electric Shepherd Productions. It was slated to enter production in early 2009.

====Failed Gondry production====

Michel Gondry was working on a film adaptation in early 2011, with Steve Golin and Steve Zaillian producing. In 2014, however, Gondry told French outlet Telerama (via Jeux Actu) that he was no longer working on the project and explained: &quot;The book is brilliant, but it&#x27;s good as a literary work. Having tried to adapt it with several screenwriters, ... at the moment I don&#x27;t feel up to doing it. It doesn&#x27;t have the dramatic structure that would make it a good film. I received a script that disheartened me a bit, and that was it. It was a dream, but in life you can&#x27;t always have what you want.&quot;

===Audiobook===
An audiobook version of &quot;Ubik&quot; was released in 2008 by Blackstone Audio. The audiobook, read by Anthony Heald, is unabridged and runs approximately 7 hours over 6 CDs. Another version released in 2016 by Brilliance Audio, read by Luke Daniels, is unabridged and runs 7 hrs 56 minutes.

===Music===

Secret Chiefs 3 created an auditory adaptation on their &quot;The Electromagnetic Azoth - &quot;Ubik&quot; / Ishraqiyun - &quot;Balance of the 19&quot;&quot; 7&quot; record. The &quot;Ubik&quot; track features musicians Trey Spruance (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle) and Bill Horist.

In 2000, Art Zoyd released a musical interpretation of the novel titled &quot;u.B.I.Q.U.e.&quot;. It is also the name of a Timo Maas single.

In 1992, Richard Pinhas released an album titled &quot;DWW&quot; featuring the tracks called &quot;Ubik&quot; and &quot;The Joe Chip Song&quot;.

In 2006, C-Jeff started a chiptune net-label called Ubiktune.

<text>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (retrospectively titled Blade Runner: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? in some later printings) is a 1968 dystopian science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick. It is set in a post-apocalyptic San Francisco, where Earth&#x27;s life has been greatly damaged by a nuclear global war. The main plot follows Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter who has to &quot;retire&quot; (i.e. kill) six escaped Nexus-6 model androids, while a secondary plot follows John Isidore, a man of sub-par IQ who aids the fugitive androids.

The book served as the basis for the 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and, even though some aspects of the novel were changed, many elements and themes from it were used in the film&#x27;s 2017 sequel &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;.

==Plot summary==
In a futuristic 1992 (2021 in later editions), after a global war that rendered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere highly radioactive, most animal species are now endangered or extinct. As a result, owning real animals has become a fashionable and expensive status symbol, while poor people can only afford realistic electric robotic imitations of animals. Also, due to the radiation, people are encouraged to move to off-world colonies with the incentive of free androids: robot servants so similar in appearance to humans that only an empathy test can confirm their identities. 

Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter for the San Francisco Police Department, is assigned to &quot;retire&quot; (kill) six defiant and violent androids of the new Nexus-6 model which have recently escaped from Mars and traveled to Earth. Deckard hopes this mission will earn him enough money to buy a live animal to replace his lone electric sheep, which would comfort his depressed wife Iran. First, Deckard visits the Seattle headquarters of the Rosen Association, which makes the androids, to confirm the accuracy of the empathy test on the new model. For business reasons, Rosen wishes to discredit the test and nearly succeeds. However, the test confirms twice that Rachael Rosen, his host in Seattle, is a Nexus-6 android, which she ultimately admits. Deckard returns to San Francisco to begin his hunt for the group of rebel androids.

Deckard meets and kills a Soviet police contact who turns out to be one of the Nexus-6 renegades in disguise. He then moves to kill his next target, an android living as an opera singer. Meeting her backstage, Deckard attempts to administer the test, but she calls the police, who arrest Deckard and detain him at a police station staffed with officers he is surprised to have never met. An official named Garland accuses Deckard himself of being an android with implanted memories. However, after a test conclusively proves that Deckard&#x27;s work is legitimate, Garland draws a gun on Deckard and reveals that the entire station is a sham, claiming that both Deckard and Phil Resch, the station&#x27;s resident bounty hunter, are also androids. Resch, unaware of Garland&#x27;s revelation, shoots Garland in the head, escaping with Deckard back to the opera singer, whom Resch next retires in cold blood. Desperate to know the truth, Resch asks Deckard to administer the empathy test on him. The test indicates Resch has sociopathic tendencies but confirms he is human. Deckard then tests himself, confirming that he is also human but has a sense of empathy for certain androids.

Having killed three androids in a day, Deckard is now able to buy his wife Iran an authentic Nubian goat. His next target is an abandoned apartment building where the three remaining android fugitives are assumed to be hiding. Deckard suddenly experiences hallucinations of a man named Mercer, the main martyr-like character in a popular religious movement who is depicted as being continuously assailed by falling rocks. The vision of Mercer tells Deckard to proceed, despite the immorality of the mission. Deckard calls on Rachael Rosen since her knowledge of android psychology may aid his investigation. Rachael declines to help, but reluctantly agrees to meet Deckard at a hotel in exchange for him abandoning the case. At the hotel, she reveals that one of the fugitive androids is the same model as her, meaning that he will have to kill an android that looks like her. Despite having initial doubts about Rachael, Deckard has sex with her, after which they confess their love for each another. Rachael reveals she has slept with many bounty hunters, having been programmed to do so in order to dissuade them from their missions. Deckard threatens to kill her but ultimately holds back and leaves for the abandoned apartment building.

The three remaining android fugitives plan to outwit Deckard. The building&#x27;s only other inhabitant, John R. Isidore, a radioactively damaged and intellectually below-average human, attempts to befriend them. He is shocked when they callously torture and mutilate a rare spider he discovers. Deckard enters the building, experiencing strange, supernatural vision again, notifying him of an ambush. When the androids attack him first, Deckard is legally justified to kill all three without testing them beforehand. Isidore is devastated and Deckard is rewarded for a record number of Nexus-6 kills in a day. Returning home, Deckard finds Iran grieving because, while he was away, Rachael stopped by their apartment and killed their goat.

Deckard travels to an uninhabited, obliterated region near the border with Oregon to reflect. He climbs a hill and is hit by falling rocks, realizing this is an experience eerily similar to the plight of the prophet Mercer. He stumbles upon a toad (an animal thought to be extinct) but, when he returns home with it, he is crestfallen when Iran discovers it is merely a robot. As he goes to sleep, she prepares to care for the electric toad anyway.

==Influence and inspiration==
Dick intentionally imitates noir fiction styles of scene delivery, a hard-boiled investigator dealing coldly with a brutal world full of corruption and stupidity. Another influence on Dick was author Theodore Sturgeon, writer of &quot;More Than Human&quot;, a surrealistic story of humanity broken into different tiers, one controlling another through telepathic means. A few years after the publication of &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, the author spoke about man&#x27;s animate creations in a famous 1972 speech: &quot;The Android and the Human&quot;:

In the novel, the android antagonists are indeed more human than the human protagonist, intentionally. They are a mirror held up to human action, contrasted with a culture losing its own humanity.

===Influence===
&quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; influenced generations of science fiction writers, becoming a founding document of the new wave science fiction movement as well as a basic model for its cyberpunk heirs. It influenced other genres such as scifi-based metal from artists including Rob Zombie and Powerman 5000.

===Adaptations===
====Film====

Hampton Fancher and David Peoples wrote a loose cinematic adaptation that became the film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, released in 1982, featuring several of the novel&#x27;s characters. It was directed by Ridley Scott. Following the international success of the film, the title &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was adopted for some later editions of the novel, although the term itself was not used in the original. This movie led to a sequel in 2017 entitled &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; which retains many themes of the novel.

====Radio====
As part of their &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; dystopia series in 2014, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a two-part adaptation of the novel. It was produced and directed by Sasha Yevtushenko from an adaption by Jonathan Holloway. It stars James Purefoy as Rick Deckard and Jessica Raine as Rachael Rosen. The episodes were originally broadcast on Sunday 15 June and 22 June 2014.

====Audiobook====
The novel has been released in audiobook form at least twice. A version was released in 1994 that featured Matthew Modine and Calista Flockhart.

A new audiobook version was released in 2007 by Random House Audio to coincide with the release of &quot;Blade Runner: The Final Cut&quot;. This version, read by Scott Brick, is unabridged and runs approximately 9.5 hours over eight CDs. This version is a tie-in, using the &quot;Blade Runner: The Final Cut&quot; film poster and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; title.

====Theater====
A stage adaptation of the book, written by Edward Einhorn, ran from November 18 to December 10, 2010, at the 3LD Art &amp; Technology Center in New York and made its West Coast Premiere on September 13, 2013, playing until October 10 at the Sacred Fools Theater Company in Los Angeles.

====Comic books====
BOOM! Studios published a 24-issue comic book limited series based on &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; containing the full text of the novel and illustrated by artist Tony Parker. The comic garnered a nomination for &quot;Best New Series&quot; from the 2010 Eisner Awards. In May 2010, BOOM! Studios began serializing an eight-issue prequel subtitled &quot;Dust To Dust&quot;, written by Chris Roberson and drawn by Robert Adler. The story takes place in the days immediately after World War Terminus.

==Sequels==
Three novels intended as sequels to both &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; have been published:
* &quot;Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human&quot; (1995)
* &quot;Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon&quot; (2000)

These official and authorized sequels were written by Dick&#x27;s friend K. W. Jeter. They continue the story of Rick Deckard and attempt to reconcile many of the differences between the novel and the 1982 film.

==Critical reception==
Critical reception of &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; has been overshadowed by the popularity of its 1982 film adaptation, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Of those critics who focus on the novel, several nest it predominantly in the history of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s body of work. In particular, Dick&#x27;s 1972 speech &quot;The Human and the Android&quot; is cited in this connection. Jill Galvan calls attention to the correspondence between Dick&#x27;s portrayal of the narrative&#x27;s dystopian, polluted, man-made setting and the description Dick gives in his speech of the increasingly artificial and potentially sentient or &quot;quasi-alive&quot; environment of his present. Summarizing the essential point of Dick&#x27;s speech, Galvan argues, &quot;[o]nly by recognizing how [technology] has encroached upon our understanding of &#x27;life&#x27; can we come to full terms with the technologies we have produced&quot; (414). As a &quot;bildungsroman of the cybernetic age&quot;, Galvan maintains, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; follows one person&#x27;s gradual acceptance of the new reality. Christopher Palmer emphasizes Dick&#x27;s speech to bring to attention the increasingly dangerous risk of humans becoming &quot;mechanical&quot;. &quot;Androids threaten reduction of what makes life valuable, yet promise expansion or redefinition of it, and so do aliens and gods&quot;. Gregg Rickman cites another, earlier, and lesser-known Dick novel that also deals with androids, &quot;We Can Build You&quot;, asserting that &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; can be read as a sequel.

In a departure from the tendency among most critics to examine the novel in relation to Dick&#x27;s other texts, Klaus Benesch examined &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; primarily in connection with Jacques Lacan&#x27;s essay on the mirror stage. There, Lacan claims that the formation and reassurance of the self depends on the construction of an Other through imagery, beginning with a double as seen in the mirror. The androids, Benesch argues, perform a doubling function similar to the mirror image of the self, but they do this on a social, not individual, scale. Therefore, human anxiety about androids expresses uncertainty about human identity and society. Benesch draws on Kathleen Woodward&#x27;s emphasis on the body to illustrate the shape of human anxiety about an android Other. Woodward asserts that the debate over distinctions between human and machine usually fails to acknowledge the presence of the body. &quot;If machines are invariably contrived as technological prostheses that are designed to amplify the physical faculties of the body, they are also built, according to this logic, to outdo, to surpass the human in the sphere of physicality altogether&quot;.

Sherryl Vint emphasizes the importance of animals for the novel&#x27;s exploration of the alienation of humans from their authentic being. In wrestling with his role as a bounty hunter who is supposedly defending society from those who lack empathy, Deckard comes to realize the artificiality of the distinctions that have been used in American culture to exclude animals and &quot;animalized&quot; humans from ethical consideration. &quot;The central role of animals in &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; and the issues of species being that they raise show the need to struggle for a different way of being in the world. This way resists commodification in our relations with one another and with nature to produce a better future, one in which humans might be fully human once again by repairing our social relations with animals and nature.&quot;

<text>Radio Free Albemuth is a dystopian novel by Philip K. Dick, written in 1976 and published posthumously in 1985. Originally titled &quot;VALISystem A&quot;, it was his first attempt to deal in fiction with his experiences of early 1974. When his publishers at Bantam requested extensive rewrites he canned the project and reworked it into the &quot;VALIS&quot; trilogy. Arbor House acquired the rights to &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; in 1985. They then published an edition under the current title (the original was too close to &quot;VALIS&quot;), prepared from the corrected typescript given by Dick to his friend Tim Powers.

==Plot summary==
In this alternate history, the corrupt United States president Ferris F. Fremont (FFF for 666, &#x27;F&#x27; being the 6th letter in the alphabet) becomes Chief Executive in the late 1960s following Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s administration. The character is best described as an amalgam of Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon, who abrogates civil liberties and human rights through positing a conspiracy theory centered on a (presumably) fictitious subversive organization known as &quot;Aramchek&quot;. In addition to this, he is associated with a right-wing populist movement called &quot;Friends of the American People&quot; (FAPers).

The President&#x27;s paranoia and opportunism lead to the establishment of a real resistance movement that is organized through narrow-beam radio transmissions from a mysterious alien near-Earth satellite by a superintelligent, extraterrestrial, but less than omnipotent being (or network) named VALIS.

Like its successor &quot;VALIS&quot;, this novel is autobiographical. Dick himself is a major character, though fictitious protagonist Nicholas Brady serves as a vehicle for Dick&#x27;s alleged gnostic theophany on February 11, 1974. In addition, Sadassa Silvia is a character who claims that Ferris Fremont is actually a communist covert agent recruited by Sadassa&#x27;s mother when Fremont was still a teenager.

As with &quot;VALIS&quot;, &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; deals with Dick&#x27;s highly personal style of Christianity (or Gnosticism). It further examines the moral and ethical repercussions of informing on trusted friends for the authorities. Also prominent is Dick&#x27;s dislike of the Republican Party, satirizing Nixon&#x27;s America as a Stalinist or neo-fascist police state. Fremont eventually captures and imprisons Dick and Brady after the latter attempts to produce and distribute a record that contains subliminal messages of revolt against the current dictatorship. Brady and Silvia are executed, and Dick narrates the concluding passage about his life in a concentration camp, while his supposedly latest work is actually penned by a ghost writer and regime-approved hack. Suddenly, however, he hears music blaring from a transistor radio which contains the same subliminal message. He and his friends, it turns out, were just a decoy set up by VALIS to deter the government from stopping a much more popular A-List band from releasing a similar record with a better-established recording company. As Dick realizes this and hears youngsters repeating the lyrics, he realizes that salvation may lie within the hearts and minds of the next generation.

==Reception==
Gerald Jonas of &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought that the novel &quot;may have been merely a first draft (and an abandoned first draft at that), but this book is not Dick at his best.&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #92, and stated that &quot;Dick: understood fear and corruption too well. I was less convinced by the visionary passages, though there&#x27;s a great line when nervy politicians destroy the alien satellite: &#x27;They shot down God.&#x27;&quot;

J. Michael Caparula reviewed &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 80. Caparula commented that &quot;The final result presents a satisfying (albeit enigmatic) conclusion to his trilogy of Valis novels (&quot;Valis&quot; and &quot;The Divine Invasion&quot; being the other two).&quot;

==Relationship to &quot;VALIS&quot;==
When he rewrote &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; as &quot;VALIS&quot;, Dick incorporated the plotline of &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; as a backdrop film (also titled &quot;VALIS&quot;) that recapitulated the central theological and existential concerns of his novel as a mise en abyme - that is, a miniature copy of his central preoccupations at this stage of his literary career, common to both works. The word &quot;albemuth&quot; was derived by Dick from the Arabic word Al Behemoth, &quot;the whale&quot;, itself an oblique reference to Fomalhaut, the star Dick at one time believed VALIS came from in real life.

==Film adaptation==

John Alan Simon wrote, produced and directed a film adaptation of &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;. Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette stars as Sadassa Silvia. Filming took place in October 2007 at Los Angeles&#x27; Lacy Street Studios and multiple other locations. The film premiered in February 2010 at the Sedona Film Festival as a work in-progress. It was released as a limited release (and VOD) on June 27, 2014.

<text>A passport is an official travel document issued by a government that certifies a person&#x27;s identity and nationality for international travel. A passport allows its bearer to enter and temporarily reside in a foreign country, access local aid and protection, and obtain consular assistance from their government. In addition to facilitating travel, passports are a key mechanism for border security and regulating migration; they may also serve as official identification for various domestic purposes. 

State-issued travel documents have existed in some form since antiquity; the modern passport was universally adopted and standardized in 1920. The passport takes the form of a booklet bearing the official name and emblem of the issuing government and containing the biographical information of the individual, including their full name, photograph, place and date of birth, and signature. A passport does not create any rights in the country being visited nor impose any obligation on the issuing country; rather, it provides certification to foreign government officials of the holder&#x27;s identity and right to travel, with pages available for inserting entry and exit stamps and travel visas—endorsements that allow the individual to enter and temporarily reside in a country for a period of time and under certain conditions.

Since 1998, many countries have transitioned to biometric passports, which contain an embedded microchip to facilitate authentication and safeguard against counterfeiting. As of July 2024, over 150 jurisdictions issue such &quot;e-passports&quot;; previously issued non-biometric passports usually remain valid until expiration.
Eligibility for a passport varies by jurisdiction, although citizenship is a common prerequisite. However, a passport may be issued to individuals who do not have the status or full rights of citizenship, such as American or British nationals. Likewise, certain classes of individuals, such as diplomats and government officials, may be issued special passports that provide certain rights and privileges, such as immunity from arrest or prosecution. 

While passports are typically issued by national governments, certain subnational entities are authorised to issue passports to citizens residing within their borders. Additionally, other types of official documents may serve a similar role to passports but are subject to different eligibility requirements, purposes, or restrictions. 

==History==

=== Etymology and origin ===
Etymological sources show that the term &quot;passport&quot; may derive from a document required by some medieval Italian states in order for an individual to pass through the physical harbor (Italian &quot;passa porto&quot;, &quot;to pass the harbor&quot;) or gate (Italian &quot;passa porte&quot;, &quot;to pass the gates&quot;) of a walled city or jurisdiction. Such documents were issued by local authorities to foreign travellers—as opposed to local citizens, as is the modern practice—and generally contained a list of towns and cities the document holder was permitted to enter or pass through. On the whole, documents were not required for travel to seaports, which were considered open trading points, but documents were required to pass harbor controls and travel inland from seaports. The transition from private to state control over movement was an essential aspect of the transition from feudalism to capitalism. Communal obligations to provide poor relief were an important source of the desire for controls on movement.:10

=== Antecedents ===
One of the earliest known references to paperwork that served an analogous role to a passport is found in the Hebrew Bible. Nehemiah 2:7–9, dating from approximately 450 BC, states that Nehemiah, an official serving King Artaxerxes I of Persia, asked permission to travel to Judea; the king granted leave and gave him a letter &quot;to the governors beyond the river&quot; requesting safe passage for him as he traveled through their lands.

The ancient Indian political text Arthashastra (third century BCE) mentions passes issued at the rate of one &quot;masha&quot; per pass to enter and exit the country, and describes the duties of the () who must issue sealed passes before a person could enter or leave the countryside.

Passports were an important part of the Chinese bureaucracy as early as the Western Han (202 BC – 9 AD), if not in the Qin dynasty. They required such details as age, height, and bodily features. These passports () determined a person&#x27;s ability to move throughout imperial counties and through points of control. Even children needed passports, but those of one year or less who were in their mother&#x27;s care may not have needed them.

In the medieval Islamic Caliphate, a form of passport was the &quot;bara&#x27;a&quot;, a receipt for taxes paid. Only people who paid their &quot;zakah&quot; (for Muslims) or &quot;jizya&quot; (for dhimmis) taxes were permitted to travel to different regions of the Caliphate; thus, the &quot;bara&#x27;a&quot; receipt was a &quot;basic passport&quot;.

In the 12th century, the Republic of Genoa issued a document called &quot;Bulletta&quot;, which was issued to the nationals of the Republic who were traveling to the ports of the emporiums and the ports of the Genoese colonies overseas, as well as to foreigners who entered them.

King Henry V of England is credited with having invented what some consider the first British passport in the modern sense, as a means of helping his subjects prove who they were in foreign lands. The earliest reference to these documents is found in a 1414 Act of Parliament. In 1540, granting travel documents in England became a role of the Privy Council of England, and it was around this time that the term &quot;passport&quot; was used. In 1794, issuing British passports became the job of the Office of the Secretary of State. In the Holy Roman Empire, the 1548 Imperial Diet of Augsburg required the public to hold imperial documents for travel, at the risk of permanent exile.

In 1791, Louis XVI masqueraded as a valet during his Flight to Varennes as passports for the nobility typically included a number of persons listed by their function but without further description.:31–32

A Pass-Card Treaty of October 18, 1850 among German states standardized information including issuing state, name, status, residence, and description of bearer. Tramping journeymen and jobseekers of all kinds were not to receive pass-cards.:92–93

=== Modern development ===
A rapid expansion of railway infrastructure and wealth in Europe beginning in the mid-nineteenth century led to large increases in the volume of international travel and a consequent unique dilution of the passport system for approximately thirty years prior to World War I. The speed of trains, as well as the number of passengers that crossed multiple borders, made enforcement of passport laws difficult. The general reaction was the relaxation of passport requirements. In the later part of the nineteenth century and up to World War I, passports were not required, on the whole, for travel within Europe, and crossing a border was a relatively straightforward procedure. Consequently, comparatively few people held passports.

During World War I, European governments introduced border passport requirements for security reasons, and to control the emigration of people with useful skills. These controls remained in place after the war, becoming a standard, though controversial, procedure. British tourists of the 1920s complained, especially about attached photographs and physical descriptions, which they considered led to a &quot;nasty dehumanisation&quot;. The British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act was passed in 1914, clearly defining the notions of citizenship and creating a booklet form of the passport.

In 1920, the League of Nations held a conference on passports, the Paris Conference on Passports &amp; Customs Formalities and Through Tickets. Passport guidelines and a general booklet design resulted from the conference, which was followed up by conferences in 1926 and 1927. The League of Nations issued Nansen passports to stateless refugees from 1922 to 1938.

While the United Nations held a travel conference in 1963, no passport guidelines resulted from it. Passport standardization came about in 1980, under the auspices of the ICAO. ICAO standards include those for machine-readable passports. Such passports have an area where some of the information otherwise written in textual form is written as strings of alphanumeric characters, printed in a manner suitable for optical character recognition. This enables border controllers and other law enforcement agents to process these passports more quickly, without having to input the information manually into a computer. ICAO publishes Doc 9303 &quot;Machine Readable Travel Documents&quot;, the technical standard for machine-readable passports. A more recent standard is for biometric passports. These contain biometrics to authenticate the identity of travellers. The passport&#x27;s critical information is stored on a tiny RFID computer chip, much like information stored on smartcards. Like some smartcards, the passport booklet design calls for an embedded contactless chip that is able to hold digital signature data to ensure the integrity of the passport and the biometric data.

Historically, legal authority to issue passports is founded on the exercise of each country&#x27;s executive discretion. Certain legal tenets follow, namely: first, passports are issued in the name of the state; second, no person has a legal right to be issued a passport; third, each country&#x27;s government, in exercising its executive discretion, has complete and unfettered discretion to refuse to issue or to revoke a passport; and fourth, that the latter discretion is not subject to judicial review. However, legal scholars including A.J. Arkelian have argued that evolutions in both the constitutional law of democratic countries and the international law applicable to all countries now render those historical tenets both obsolete and unlawful.

==Types==

Governments around the world issue a variety of passports for different purposes. The most common variety are ordinary passports issued to individual citizens and other nationals. In the past, certain countries issued collective passports or family passports. Today, passports are typically issued to individual travellers rather than groups. Aside from ordinary passports issued to citizens by national governments, there are a variety of other types of passports by governments in specific circumstances.

While individuals are typically only permitted to hold one passport, certain governments permit citizens to hold more than one ordinary passport. Individuals may also simultaneously hold an ordinary passport and an official or diplomatic passport.

=== Emergency passport ===
Emergency passports (also called temporary passports) are issued to persons with urgent need to travel who do not have passports, e.g. someone abroad whose passport has been lost or stolen who needs to travel home within a few days, someone whose passport expires abroad, or someone who urgently needs to travel abroad who does not have a passport with sufficient validity. These passports are intended for very short durations, e.g. to allow immediate one-way travel back to the home country. Laissez-passer are also used for this purpose. Uniquely, the United Kingdom issues emergency passports to citizens of certain Commonwealth states who lose their passports in non-Commonwealth countries where their home state does not maintain a diplomatic or consular mission.

===Diplomatic and official passports===

Pursuant to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and the immunity afforded to officials of a foreign state under customary international law, diplomats and other individuals travelling on government business are entitled to reduced scrutiny at border checkpoints when travelling overseas. Consequently, such individuals are typically issued special passports indicating their status. These passports come in three distinct varieties:

==== Diplomatic passports ====
: Typically issued to accredited diplomats, senior consular staff, heads of state or government, and to senior foreign ministry employees. Individuals holding diplomatic passports are usually entitled to certain degrees of immunity from border control inspections, depending on their home countries and their countries of entry.

==== Service/official passports ====
: Issued to senior government officials travelling on state business who are not eligible for diplomatic passports. Holders of official passports are typically entitled to similar immunity from border control inspections. In the United States of America, official and service passports are two distinct categories of passport, with official passports being issued to senior government officials while service passports are issued to government contractors.

==== Public affairs passports ====
: Issued to Chinese citizens holding senior positions in state-owned companies. While public affairs passports do not usually entitle their bearers to exemption from searches at border checkpoints, they are subject to more liberal visa policies in several countries primarily in Africa and Asia (see: Visa requirements for Chinese citizens).

===Passports without right of abode===


Unlike most countries, the United Kingdom and the Republic of China issue various categories of passports to individuals without the right of abode in their territory. In the United Kingdom&#x27;s case, these passports are typically issued to individuals connected with a former British colony while, in the ROC&#x27;s case, these passports are the result of the legal distinction between ROC nationals with and without residence in the area it administers. In both cases, holders of such passports are able to obtain residence on an equal footing with foreigners by applying for indefinite leave to remain (UK) or a resident certificate (ROC).

====Republic of China (Taiwan)====
A Republic of China citizen who does not have household registration () in the area administered by the ROC is classified as a National Without Household Registration (NWOHR; ) and is subject to immigration controls when clearing ROC border controls, does not have automatic residence rights, and cannot vote in Taiwanese elections. However, they are exempt from conscription. Most individuals with this status are children born overseas to ROC citizens who do hold household registration. Additionally, because the ROC observes the principle of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;, members of the overseas Chinese community are also regarded as citizens. During the Cold War, both the ROC and PRC governments actively sought the support of overseas Chinese communities in their attempts to secure the position as the legitimate sole government of China. The ROC also encouraged overseas Chinese businessmen to settle in Taiwan to facilitate economic development and regulations concerning evidence of ROC nationality by descent were particularly lax during the period, allowing many overseas Chinese the right to settle in Taiwan. About 60,000 NWOHRs currently hold Taiwanese passports with this status.

====United Kingdom====
The United Kingdom issues several similar but distinct passports which correspond to the country&#x27;s several categories of nationality. Full British citizens are issued a standard British passport. British citizens resident in the Crown Dependencies may hold variants of the British passport which confirm their Isle of Man, Jersey, or Guernsey identity. Many of the other categories of nationality do not grant bearers right of abode in the United Kingdom itself. 

British National (Overseas) passports are issued to individuals connected to Hong Kong prior to its return to China. British Overseas Citizen passports are primarily issued to individuals who did not acquire the citizenship of the colony they were connected to when it obtained independence (or their stateless descendants). British Overseas Citizen passports are also issued to certain categories of Malaysian nationals in Penang and Malacca, and individuals connected to Cyprus as a result of the legislation granting independence to those former British colonies. British Protected Person passports are issued to otherwise stateless people connected to a former British protectorate. British subject passports are issued to otherwise stateless individuals connected to British India or to certain categories of Irish citizens (though, in the latter case, they do convey right of abode). 

Additionally, individuals connected to a British overseas territory are accorded British Overseas Territories citizenship and may hold passports issued by the governments of their respective territory. All overseas territory citizens are also now eligible for full British citizenship. Each territory maintains its own criteria for determining whom it grants right of abode. Consequently, individuals holding BOTC passports are not necessarily entitled to enter or reside in the territory that issued their passport. Most countries distinguish between BOTC and other classes of British nationality for border control purposes. For instance, only Bermudian passport holders with an endorsement stating that they possess right of abode or belonger status in Bermuda are entitled to enter America without an electronic travel authorisation.

Border control policies in many jurisdictions distinguish between holders of passports with and without right of abode, including NWOHRs and holders of the various British passports that do not confer right of abode upon the bearer. Certain jurisdictions may additionally distinguish between holders of such British passports with and without indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. NWOHRs do not, for instance, have access to the Visa Waiver Program, or to visa free access to the Schengen Area or Japan. Other countries, such as India which allows all Chinese nationals to apply for eVisas, do not make such a distinction. Notably, while Singapore does permit visa free entry to all categories of British passport holders, it reduces length of stay for British nationals without right of abode in the United Kingdom, but does not distinguish between ROC passport holders with and without household registration.

Until 31 January 2021, holders of British National (Overseas) passports were able to use their UK passports for immigration clearance in Hong Kong and to seek consular protection from overseas Chinese diplomatic missions. This was a unique arrangement as it involved a passport issued by one state conferring right of abode (or, more precisely right to land) in and consular protection from another state. Since that date, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments have prohibited the use of BN(O) passports as travel documents or proof of identity and it; much like British Overseas Citizen, British Protected Person, or ROC NWOHR passports; is not associated with right of abode in any territory. BN(O)s who do not possess Chinese (or any other) nationality are required to use a Document of Identity for Visa Purposes for travel. This restriction disproportionally affects ease of travel for permanent residents of Indian, Pakistani, and Nepali ethnicity, who were not granted Chinese nationality in 1997. As an additional consequence, Hongkongers seeking early pre-retirement withdrawals from the Mandatory Provident Fund pension scheme may not use BN(O) passports for identity verification.

====Latvia and Estonia====
Similarly, non-citizens in Latvia and in Estonia are individuals, primarily of Russian or Ukrainian ethnicity, who are not citizens of Latvia or Estonia, but who have settled during the Soviet occupation, and thus have the right to a special non-citizen passport issued by the government as well as some other specific rights. Approximately two thirds of them are ethnic Russians, followed by ethnic Belarusians, ethnic Ukrainians, ethnic Poles and ethnic Lithuanians. According to the UN Special Rapporteur, the citizenship and naturalization laws in Latvia &quot;are seen by the Russian community as discriminatory practices&quot;. Per Russian visa policy, holders of the Estonian alien&#x27;s passport or the Latvian non-citizen passport are entitled to visa free entry to Russia, in contrast to Estonian and Latvian citizens who must obtain an electronic visa.

===Regional and subnational passports===
====China====
The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) authorises its Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau to issue passports to their permanent residents with Chinese nationality under the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; arrangement. Visa policies imposed by foreign authorities on Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents holding such passports are different from those holding ordinary passports of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. A Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport (HKSAR passport) and Macau Special Administrative Region passport (MSAR passport) gain visa-free access to many more countries than ordinary PRC passports.

On 1 July 2011, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People&#x27;s Republic of China launched a trial issuance of e-passports for individuals conducting public affairs work overseas on behalf of the Chinese government. The face, fingerprints, and other biometric features of the passport holder is digitized and stored in pre-installed contactless smart chip, along with &quot;the passport owner&#x27;s name, sex and personal photo as well as the passport&#x27;s term of validity and [the] digital certificate of the chip&quot;. Ordinary biometric passports were introduced by the Ministry of Public Security on 15 May 2012. As of January 2015, all new passports issued by China are biometric e-passports, and non-biometric passports are no longer issued.

In 2012, over 38 million Chinese citizens held ordinary passports, comprising only 2.86 percent of the total population at the time. In 2014, China issued 16 million passports, ranking first in the world, surpassing the United States (14 million) and India (10 million). The number of ordinary passports in circulation rose to 120 million by October 2016, which was approximately 8.7 percent of the population. As of April 2017 to date, China had issued over 100 million biometric ordinary passports.

====Kingdom of Denmark====
The three constituent countries of the Danish Realm have a common nationality. Denmark proper is a member of the European Union, but Greenland and Faroe Islands are not. Danish citizens residing in Greenland or Faroe Islands can choose between holding a Danish EU passport and a Greenlandic or Faroese non-EU Danish passport.

As of 21 September 2022, Danish citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 188 countries and territories, thus ranking the Danish passport fifth in the world (tied with the passports of Austria, the Netherlands, and Sweden) according to the Henley Passport Index. According to the World Tourism Organization 2016 report, the Danish passport is first in the world (tied with Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Singapore, and the United Kingdom) in terms of travel freedom, with the mobility index of 160 (out of 215 with no visa weighted by 1, visa on arrival weighted by 0.7, eVisa by 0.5 and traditional visa weighted by 0).

====Serbian Coordination Directorate Passports in Kosovo====
Under Serbian law, people born or otherwise legally settled in Kosovo are considered Serbian nationals and as such they are entitled to a Serbian passport. However, these passports are not issued directly by the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs but by the Serbian Coordination Directorate for Kosovo and Metohija instead. These particular passports do not allow the holder to enter the Schengen Area without a visa.

As of August 2023, Serbian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 138 countries and territories, ranking the Serbian passport 38th overall in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley Passport Index. Serbian passport is one of the 5 passports with the most improved rating globally since 2006 in terms of number of countries that its holders may visit without a visa.

====American Samoa====
Although all U.S. citizens are also U.S. nationals, the reverse is not true. As specified in , a person whose only connection to the United States is through birth in an outlying possession (which is defined in as American Samoa and Swains Island, the latter of which is administered as part of American Samoa), or through descent from a person so born, acquires U.S. nationality but not the citizenship. This was formerly the case in a few other current or former U.S. overseas possessions, i.e. the Panama Canal Zone and Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The passport issued to non-citizen nationals contains the endorsement code 9 which states: &quot;THE BEARER IS A UNITED STATES NATIONAL AND NOT A UNITED STATES CITIZEN.&quot; on the annotations page. Non-citizen nationals may reside and work in the United States without restrictions, and may apply for citizenship under the same rules as resident aliens. Like resident aliens, they are not presently allowed by any U.S. state to vote in federal or state elections.

===Passports issued by entities without sovereign territory===

Several entities without a sovereign territory issue documents described as passports, most notably Iroquois League, the Aboriginal Provisional Government in Australia and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Such documents are not necessarily accepted for entry into a country.

==Details and specifications==
===Criteria for issuance===
Each country sets its own conditions for the issue of passports. Under the law of most countries, passports are government property, and may be limited or revoked at any time, usually on specified grounds, and possibly subject to judicial review. In many countries, surrender of one&#x27;s passport is a condition of granting bail in lieu of imprisonment for a pending criminal trial due to the risk of the person leaving the country. When passport holders apply for a new passport (commonly, due to expiration of the previous passport, insufficient validity for entry to some countries or lack of blank pages), they may be required to surrender the old passport for invalidation. In some circumstances an expired passport is not required to be surrendered or invalidated (for example, if it contains an unexpired visa).

Requirements for passport applicants vary significantly from country to country, with some states imposing stricter measures than others. For example, Pakistan requires applicants to be interviewed before a Pakistani passport will be granted. When applying for a passport or a national ID card, all Pakistanis are required to sign an oath declaring Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be an impostor prophet and all Ahmadis to be non-Muslims. In contrast, individuals holding British National (Overseas) status are legally entitled to hold a passport in that capacity.

Countries with conscription or national service requirements may impose restrictions on passport applicants who have not yet completed their military obligations. For example, in Finland, male citizens aged 18–30 years must prove that they have completed, or are exempt from, their obligatory military service to be granted an unrestricted passport; otherwise a passport is issued valid only until the end of their 28th year, to ensure that they return to carry out military service. Other countries with obligatory military service, such as South Korea and Syria, have similar requirements, e.g. South Korean passport and Syrian passport.

===Validity===

Passports have a limited validity, usually between 5 and 10 years. Many countries require passports to be valid for a minimum of six months beyond the planned date of departure, as well as having at least two to four blank pages. It is recommended that a passport be valid for at least six months from the departure date as many airlines deny boarding to passengers whose passport has a shorter expiry date, even if the destination country does not have such a requirement for incoming visitors.

There is an increasing trend for adult passports to be valid for ten years, such as a United Kingdom passport, United States Passport, New Zealand Passport (after 30 November 2015) or Australian passport.

Some countries issue passports that valid for longer than 10 years, which ICAO does not recommend due to the security concerns and even some countries including all member states of the European Union do not accept passports older than 10 years.

===Cover designs===


Passport booklets from almost all countries around the world display the national coat of arms of the issuing country on the front cover. The United Nations keeps a record of national coats of arms, but displaying a coat of arms is not an internationally recognised requirement for a passport.

There are several groups of countries that have, by mutual agreement, adopted common designs for their passports:

* The European Union. The design and layout of passports of the member states of the European Union are a result of consensus and recommendation, rather than of directive. Passports are issued by member states and may consist of either the usual passport booklet or the newer passport card format. The covers of ordinary passport booklets are burgundy-red (except for Croatia which has a blue cover), with &quot;European Union&quot; written in the national language or languages. Below that are the name of the country, the national coat of arms, the word or words for &quot;passport&quot;, and, at the bottom, the symbol for a biometric passport. The data page can be at the front or at the back of a passport booklet and there are significant design differences throughout to indicate which member state is the issuer. Member states that participate in the Schengen Agreement have agreed that their e-passports should contain fingerprint information in the chip.
* In 2006, the members of the CA-4 Treaty (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua) adopted a common-design passport, called the Central American passport, following a design already in use by Nicaragua and El Salvador since the mid-1990s. It features a navy-blue cover with the words &quot;América Central&quot; and a map of Central America, and with the territory of the issuing country highlighted in gold (in place of the individual nations&#x27; coats of arms). At the bottom of the cover are the name of the issuing country and the passport type.
* The members of the Andean Community of Nations (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru) began to issue commonly designed passports in 2005. Specifications for the common passport format were outlined in an Andean Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in 2002. Previously issued national passports will be valid until their expiry dates. Andean passports are bordeaux (burgundy-red), with words in gold. Centred above the national seal of the issuing country is the name of the regional body in Spanish (&quot;Comunidad Andina&quot;). Below the seal is the official name of the member country. At the bottom of the cover is the Spanish word &quot;pasaporte&quot; along with the English &quot;passport&quot;. Venezuela had issued Andean passports, but has subsequently left the Andean Community, so they will no longer issue Andean passports.
* The Union of South American Nations had signaled an intention to establish a common passport design, but it is doubtful that this will happen since the group effectively broke up in 2019.
* Twelve member states of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) began issuing passports with a common design since early 2009. It features the CARICOM symbol along with the national coat of arms and name of the member state, rendered in a CARICOM official language (English, French, Dutch). The member states which use the common design are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. There was a movement by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to issue a common designed passport, but the implementation of the CARICOM passport made that redundant, and it was abandoned.

===Request page===

Passports sometimes contain a message, usually near the front, requesting that the passport&#x27;s bearer be allowed to pass freely, and further requesting that, in the event of need, the bearer be granted assistance. The message is sometimes made in the name of the government or the head of state, and may be written in more than one language, depending on the language policies of the issuing authority.

===Languages===

In 1920, an international conference on passports and through tickets held by the League of Nations recommended that passports be issued in the French language, historically the language of diplomacy, and one other language. Currently, the ICAO recommends that passports be issued in English, French, and Spanish; or in the national language of the issuing country and in either English, French, or Spanish. Many European countries use their national language, along with English and French.

Some additional language combinations are:
* National passports of the European Union bear all of the official languages of the European Union. Two or three languages are printed at the relevant points, followed by reference numbers which point to the passport page where translations into the remaining languages appear.
* Algerian, Chadian, Lebanese, Mauritanian, Moroccan and Tunisian passports are in three languages: Arabic, English, and French.
* The Barbadian passport and the United States passport are tri-lingual: English, French and Spanish. United States passports were English and French since 1976, but began being printed with a Spanish message and labels during the late 1990s, in recognition of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Spanish-speaking status. Since 2007, the Data Page, which contains photo, identifying information, and the passport&#x27;s issuance and expiration dates, and the Personal Data and Emergency Contact page are written in English, French, and Spanish; the cover and instructions pages are printed solely in English.
* On Belgian passports, all three official languages (Dutch, French, German) appear on the cover, in addition to English on the main page. The order of the official languages depends on the official residence of the holder.
* Passports of Bosnia and Herzegovina are in the three official languages of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian in addition to English.
* Brazilian passports contain four languages: Portuguese, the official country language; Spanish, because of bordering nations; English and French.
* British passports bear English and French on the information page and Spanish, Welsh, Irish and Scottish Gaelic translations on an extra page.
* Cypriot passports are in Greek, Turkish and English.
* Haitian passports are in French and Haitian Creole.
* Passports issued by the Holy See are in Latin (the language of the Catholic Church), French, and English.
* The first page of the old Libyan passport (green cover) was in Arabic only. The current passport has dark-blue cover, is electronically readable, and has Arabic with English translation in the first page (first page from a right-to-left script viewpoint). Similar arrangements are found in the passports of some other Arab countries.
* Iraqi passports are in Arabic, Kurdish and English.
* Macau SAR passports are in three languages: Chinese (in traditional Chinese characters), Portuguese and English.
*New Zealand passports are in English and te reo Māori.
* Norwegian passports are in the two forms of the Norwegian language, Bokmål and Nynorsk, Northern Sami and English.
* Sri Lankan passports are in Sinhala, Tamil and English.
* Swiss passports are in five languages: German, French, Italian, Romansh and English.

==Limitations on use==

A passport is merely an identity document that is widely recognised for international travel purposes, and the possession of a passport does not in itself entitle a traveller to enter any country other than the country that issued it, and sometimes not even then, as with holders of the British Overseas citizen passport. Many countries normally require visitors to obtain a visa. Each country has different requirements or conditions for the grant of visas, such as for the visitor not being likely to become a public charge for financial, health, family, or other reasons, and the holder not having been convicted of a crime or considered likely to commit one. Where a country does not recognise another, or is in dispute with it, entry may be prohibited to holders of passports of the other party to the dispute, and sometimes to others who have, for example, visited the other country; examples are listed below. A country that issues a passport may also restrict its validity or use in specified circumstances, such as use for travel to certain countries for political, security, or health reasons.

Many nations implement border controls restricting the entry of people of certain nationalities or who have visited certain countries. For instance, Georgia refuses entry to holders of passports issued by the Republic of China. Similarly, since April 2017, nationals of Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and Iran have been banned from entering the parts of eastern Libya under the control of the Tobruk government. The Pakistani passports explicitly mention that these passports are valid in all countries except Israel. The majority of Arab countries, as well as Iran and Malaysia, ban Israeli citizens; however, exceptional entry to Malaysia is possible with approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs. Certain countries may also restrict entry to those with Israeli stamps or visas in their passports. As a result of tension over the former Republic of Artsakh dispute, Azerbaijan currently forbids entry to Armenian citizens as well as to individuals with proof of travel to Artsakh.
Between September 2017 and January 2021, the United States of America did not issue new visas to nationals of Iran, North Korea, Libya, Somalia, Syria, or Yemen pursuant to restrictions imposed by the Trump administration, which were subsequently repealed by the Biden administration on 20 January 2021. While in force, the restrictions were conditional and could be lifted if the countries affected meet the required security standards specified by the Trump administration, and dual citizens of these countries could still enter if they presented a passport from a non-designated country.

==Value==
One method by which to rank the value of a passport is to calculate its mobility score (MS). The mobility score of a passport is the number of countries that allow the holder of that passport to enter for general tourism visa-free, visa-on-arrival, eTA, or eVisa issued within 3 days. As of 2023, the strongest passport in the world is the Singaporean passport. 
However, another way to determine passport mobility score is the number of countries it allows holders to live and work in. For example, by this measure, the Irish passport would be most powerful because it allows the holder to live in all European Union/European Economic Area countries, as well as Switzerland and the United Kingdom, as the Irish passport is the only European Union passport now that still allows its users the right to live/work in the United Kingdom.

<text>A point-of-view shot (also known as POV shot, first-person shot or subjective camera) is a film scene—usually a short one—that is shot as if through the eyes of a character (the subject). The camera shows what the subject&#x27;s eyes would see. It is usually established by being positioned between a shot of a character looking at something, and a shot showing the character&#x27;s reaction (see shot reverse shot). The POV technique is one of the foundations of film editing.

==Subjectives==
A POV shot need not be the strict point-of-view of an actual single character in a film. Sometimes the point-of-view shot is taken over the shoulder of the character (third person), who remains visible on the screen. Sometimes a POV shot is &quot;shared&quot; (&quot;dual&quot; or &quot;triple&quot;), i.e. it represents the joint POV of two (or more) characters.

Point-of-view, or simply p.o.v., camera angles record the scene from a particular player&#x27;s viewpoint. The point-of-view is an objective angle, but since it falls between the objective and subjective angle, it should be placed in a separate category and given special consideration. A point-of-view shot is as close as an objective shot can approach a subjective shot—and still remain objective. The camera is positioned at the side of a subjective player—whose viewpoint is being depicted—so that the audience is given the impression they are standing cheek-to-cheek with the off-screen player. The viewer does not see the event through the player&#x27;s eyes, as in a subjective shot in which the camera trades places with the screen player. He sees the event from the player&#x27;s viewpoint, as if standing alongside him. Thus, the camera angle remains objective, since it is an unseen observer not involved in the action.&quot; 
:—Joseph V. Mascelli, &quot;The Five C&#x27;s of Cinematography&quot;

Supporting narrative elements are required to indicate the shot to the viewer as a POV shot. These may include shot sequencing, sound effects, visual effects and acting.

==Leading actor POV==
When the leading actor is the subject of the POV it is known as the subjective viewpoint. The audience sees events through the leading actor&#x27;s eyes, as if they were experiencing the events themselves. Some films are partially or totally shot using this technique, for example the 1947 film noir &quot;Lady in the Lake&quot;, which is shot entirely through the subjective POV of its central character in an attempt to replicate the first-person narrative style of the Raymond Chandler novel upon which the film is based.

==Technology==

POV footage has existed since the first cameras were mounted in early airplanes and cars, anywhere a film&#x27;s creator intended to take viewers inside the action with the psychological purpose of giving viewers a feel of &quot;What he or she is going through&quot;, he or she being a participant in the subject matter. Cameras were increasingly introduced into more difficult experiences.

Dick Barrymore, an early action filmmaker akin to Warren Miller, experimented with film cameras and counter weights mounted to a helmet. Barrymore could ski unencumbered while capturing footage of scenery and other skiers. Though the unit was heavy relative to its manner of use, it was considered hands-free, and worked.

Numerous companies have developed successful POV designs, from laparoscopic video equipment used inside the body during medical procedures, to high tech film and digital cameras mounted to jets and employed during flight, or on helmet based systems used by cinematographers. These designs are expensive, and mostly bespoke or DIY solutions. There are systems made by camera equipment manufacturers, but they require professional filmmaking experience and training.

Up until the 2010&#x27;s, the race for hands-free POV cameras for use on a consumer level has faced problems. The technology has had issues with usability, combining lenses with microphones with batteries with recording units; all connected using spidery cables, which proved cumbersome in use when compared to the quality of the end content. Since then, improvements in mobile phone camera systems and the introduction of action cameras from companies like GoPro, DJI, and Insta360 have risen to the occasion and offer sophisticated camera stabilization with video quality that is impressive for their small camera sensor size.

==Notable examples==
In making 1927&#x27;s &quot;Napoléon&quot;, director Abel Gance wrapped a camera and much of the lens in sponge padding so that it could be punched by other actors to portray the leading character&#x27;s point of view during a fist fight, part of a larger snowball fight between schoolboys including young Napoleon. Gance wrote in the technical scenario that the camera &quot;defends itself as if it were Bonaparte himself. It is in the fortress and fights back. It clambers on the wall of snow and jumps down, as if it were human. A punch in the lens. Arms at the side of the camera as if the camera itself had arms. Camera K falls on the ground, struggles, gets up.&quot; In the scenario, &quot;Camera K&quot; refers to Gance&#x27;s main photographer, Jules Kruger, who wore the camera mounted to a breastplate strapped to his chest for these shots.

POV shots were used extensively by Alfred Hitchcock for various narrative effects.

In &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1931), director Rouben Mamoulian uses a beginning point-of-view shot.
The long running British sitcom &quot;Peep Show&quot; is filmed entirely in point-of-view shots.

The film &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; often showed the killer&#x27;s perspective, and the killer was not revealed until the end. Horror and thriller movies often use POV to make the audience see only what one character sees, to add suspense.

The film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs (film)&quot; (1991) contains a large number of shots shown from Clarice Starling&#x27;s (Jodie Foster) POV, in which other characters often look at and talk directly into the camera lens.

&quot;The Plainclothesman&quot;, an early US television series, assumed the title character&#x27;s POV.

&quot;Enter the Void&quot; (2009) by Gaspar Noé is shot from the first-person viewpoint, although in an unusual way, since most of the movie involves an out-of-body experience.

The action film &quot;Hardcore Henry&quot; (2015) consists entirely of POV shots, presenting events from the perspective of the title character, in the style of a first-person shooter video game.

Nearly the entire film &quot;Maniac&quot; is shot from the murderer&#x27;s point of view, with his face being shown only in reflections and occasionally in the third person.

The documentary &quot;I Didn&#x27;t See You There&quot; (2022) is shot from the physical perspective of director Reid Davenport, largely from his electric wheelchair. The film expands the scope of point-of-view cinema towards a disabled aesthetic generated by Davenport&#x27;s embodiment.

<text>Persistence of vision is the optical illusion that occurs when the visual perception of an object does not cease for some time after the rays of light proceeding from it have ceased to enter the eye. 
The illusion has also been described as &quot;retinal persistence&quot;, &quot;persistence of impressions&quot;, simply &quot;persistence&quot; and other variations. A very commonly given example of the phenomenon is the apparent fiery trail of a glowing coal or burning stick while it is whirled around in the dark.

Many explanations of the illusion actually seem to describe positive afterimages and the neurological effect can be compared to the technological effect of motion blur in photography (or in film and video).

&quot;Persistence of vision&quot; can also be understood to mean the same as &quot;flicker fusion&quot;, the effect that vision seems to persist continuously when the light that enters the eyes is interrupted with short and regular intervals. When the frequency is too high for the visual system to discern differences between moments, light and dark impressions fuse together into a continuous impression of the scene with intermediate brightness (as defined by the Talbot-Plateau law).

Since its introduction, the term &quot;persistence of vision&quot; has often been mistaken to be the explanation for motion perception in optical toys like the phenakistiscope and the zoetrope, and later in cinema. This theory has been disputed since long before cinematography&#x27;s breakthrough in 1895. The illusion of motion as a result of fast intermittent presentations of sequential images is a stroboscopic effect, as explained in 1833 by Simon Stampfer (one of the inventors of the stroboscopic disc, a.k.a. phenakistiscope).

Early descriptions of the illusion often attributed the effect purely to the physiology of the eye, particularly of the retina. Nerves and parts of the brain later became accepted as important factors.

Sensory memory has been cited as a cause.

==Natural occurrences and applications==
Impressions of several natural phenomena and the principles of some optical toys have been attributed to persistence of vision. In 1768, Patrick D&#x27;Arcy recognised the effect in &quot;the luminous ring that we see by turning a torch quickly, the fire wheels in the fireworks, the flattened spindle shape we see in a vibrating cord, the continuous circle we see in a cogwheel that turns with speed&quot;. Basically everything that resembles motion blur seen in fast moving objects could be regarded as &quot;persistence of vision&quot;.

===Sparkler&#x27;s trail effect===
The apparent line of light behind a fast moving luminous object is known as the &quot;sparkler&#x27;s trail effect&quot;, since it is commonly known from the use of sparklers.

===Light painting===
The effect has occasionally been applied in the arts by writing or drawing with a light source recorded by a camera with a long exposure time.

This concept has been further developed into media with computer-controlled moving light sources (nowadays mostly LED light), known as S.W.I.M. (Sequential Wave Imprinting Machine). However, like video and television, the technology actually gets rid of the visual trail of fast-moving lights by presenting a stroboscopic sequence of very short visual cues (resulting in a sharp image, still or animated).

===Color-top / Newton disc===

Colors on spinning tops or rotating wheels mix together if the motion is too fast to register the details. A colored dot then appears as a circle and one line can make the whole surface appear in one uniform hue.

The Newton disc optically mixes wedges of Isaac Newton&#x27;s primary colors into one (off-)white surface when it spins fast.

===Thaumatrope===
In April 1825 the first &quot;Thaumatrope&quot; was published by W. Phillips (in anonymous association with John Ayrton Paris). The fact that the pictures on either side of the twirling disc seem to blend together into one image has often falsely been presented as an illustration of the effect of persistence of vision (the fusion instead depends on stroboscopic interruptions and the compatibility of the mental impressions of the two alternating pictures).

The differences between impressions of quick alternations of two figures –depending on tachistoscope frequencies, distance between the figures, and/or variance in shapes– was studied by Max Wertheimer in 1912. These experiments inspired the theories of Gestalt psychology.

===Kaleidoscopic colour-top===
In April 1858 John Gorham patented his &quot;Kaleidoscopic colour-top&quot;. This is a top on which two small discs are placed, usually one with colors and a black one with cut-out patterns. When the discs spin and the top disc is retarded into regular jerky motions the toy exhibits &quot;beautiful forms which are similar to those of the kaleidoscope&quot; with multiplied colours. Gorham described how the colours appear mixed on the spinning top &quot;from the duration of successive impressions on the retina&quot;. Gorham founded the principle on &quot;the well-known experiment of whirling a stick, ignited at one end&quot; (a.k.a. the sparkler&#x27;s trail effect).

===Rubber pencil trick===
A pencil or another rigid straight line can appear as bending like flexible rubber when it is wiggled fast enough between fingers, or otherwise undergoing rigid motion.

Persistence of vision has been discarded as sole cause of the illusion. It is thought that the eye movements of the observer fail to track the motions of features of the object.

This effect is widely known as an entertaining &quot;magic&quot; trick for children.

==History==
Phenomena related to flicker fusion and motion blur have been described since antiquity. Film historians have often confused flicker fusion with afterimages that arise after staring at an object, while mostly ignoring the importance of the stroboscopic effect in their explanations of motion perception in film.

===Historical references to afterimages and motion blur===
Aristotle (384–322 BC) noted that the image of the sun remained in his vision after he stopped looking at it.

The discovery of persistence of vision is sometimes attributed to the Roman poet Lucretius (), although he only mentions something similar in connection with images seen in a dream.

Around 165 AD Ptolemy described in his book &quot;Optics&quot; a rotating potter&#x27;s wheel with different colors on it. He noted how the different colors of sectors mixed together into one color and how dots appeared as circles when the wheel was spinning very fast. When lines are drawn across the axis of the disc they make the whole surface appear to be of a uniform color. &quot;The visual impression that is created in the first revolution is invariably followed by repeated instances that subsequently produce an identical impression. This also happens in the case of shooting stars, whose light seems distended on account of their speed of motion, all according to the amount of
perceptible distance it passes along with the sensible impression that arises in the visual faculty.&quot;

Porphyry (circa 243–305) in his commentary on Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Harmonics&quot; describes how the senses are not stable but confused and inaccurate. Certain intervals between repeated impressions are not detected. A white or black spot on a spinning cone (or top) appears as a circle of that color and a line on the top makes the whole surface appear in that color. &quot;Because of the swiftness of the movement we receive the impression of the line on every part of the cone as the line moves.&quot;

In the 11th century Ibn al-Haytham, who was familiar with Ptolemy&#x27;s writings, described how colored lines on a spinning top could not be discerned as different colors but appeared as one new color composed of all of the colors of the lines. He deducted that sight needs some time to discern a color. al-Haytam also noted that the top appeared motionless when spun extremely quickly &quot;for none of its points remains fixed in the same spot for any perceptible time&quot;.

Leonardo da Vinci wrote in a notebook: &quot;Every body that moves rapidly seems to colour its path with the impression of its hue. The truth of this proposition is seen from experience; thus when the lightning moves among dark clouds the speed of its sinuous flight makes its whole course resemble a luminous snake. So in like manner if you wave a lighted brand its whole course will seem a ring of flame. This is because the organ of perception acts more rapidly than the judgment.&quot;

In his 1704 book &quot;Opticks&quot;, Isaac Newton (1642–1726/27) described a machine with prisms, a lens and a large moving comb with teeth causing alternating colors to be projected successively. If this was done quickly enough, the alternating colours could no longer be perceived separately but were seen as white. Newton compared its principle to the sparkler&#x27;s trail effect: a gyrating burning coal could appear as a circle of fire because &quot;the sensation of the coal in the several places of that circle remains impress&#x27;d on the sensorium, until the coal return again to the same place.&quot;

In 1768 Patrick d&#x27;Arcy (1725-1779) reported how he had measured a duration of 0.13 seconds for one full rotation of a burning coal while it was seen as a full circle of light. He registered multiple rotations with a purpose-built machine in his garden and with the collaboration of an observer who had superior eyesight (D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s own eyesight had been damaged in an accident). D&#x27;Arcy suspected that the duration may differ between different observers, light intensities of spinning objects, colours and viewing distances. He planned further experiments to determine such possible differences, but no results seem to have been published.

===1820–1866: Revolving wheel===
 
In 1821 the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and The Arts&quot; published a &quot;letter to the editor&quot; with the title &quot;Account of an Optical Deception.&quot; It was dated Dec. 1, 1820 and attributed to &quot;J.M.&quot;, possibly publisher/editor John Murray himself. The author noted that the spokes of a rotating wheel seen through fence slats appeared with peculiar curvatures (see picture). The letter concluded: &quot;The general principles on which this deception is based will immediately occur to your mathematical readers, but a perfect demonstration will probably prove less easy than it appears on first sight&quot;. Four years later Peter Mark Roget offered an explanation when reading at the Royal Society on December 9, 1824. He added: &quot;It is also to be noticed that, however rapidly the wheel revolves, each individual spoke, during the moment it is viewed, appears to be at rest.&quot; Roget claimed that the illusion is due to the fact &quot;that an impression made by a pencil of rays on the retina, if sufficiently vivid, will remain for a certain time after the cause has ceased.&quot; He also provided mathematical details about the appearing curvatures.

As a university student Joseph Plateau noticed in some of his early experiments that when looking from a small distance at two concentric cogwheels which turned fast in opposite directions, it produced the optical illusion of a motionless wheel. He later read Peter Mark Roget&#x27;s 1824 article and decided to investigate the phenomenon further. He published his findings in &quot;Correspondance Mathématique et Physique&quot; in 1828 and 1830. In 1829 Plateau presented his then unnamed anorthoscope in his doctoral thesis &quot;Sur quelques propriétés des impressions produites par la lumière sur l&#x27;organe de la vue&quot;. The anorthoscope was a disc with an anamorphic picture that could be viewed as a clear immobile image when the disc was rotated and seen through the four radial slits of a counter-rotating disc. The discs could also be translucent and lit from behind through the slits of the counter-rotating disc.

On 10 December 1830, scientist Michael Faraday wrote a paper for the &quot;Journal of the Royal Institution of Great Britain&quot;, entitled &quot;On a Peculiar Class of Optical Deceptions&quot;. Two instances of rotating wheels that appeared to stand still had been pointed out to him and he had read about the somewhat similar palisade illusion in Roget&#x27;s article. Faraday started experimenting with rotations of toothed cardboard wheels. Several effects had already been described by Plateau, but Faraday also simplified the experiment by looking at a mirror through the spaces between the teeth in the circumference of the cardboard disc. On 21 January 1831, Faraday presented the paper at the Royal Institution, with some new experiments. He had cut concentric series of apertures nearer to the center of a disc (representing smaller cogwheels) with small differences in the amount of &quot;cogs&quot; per &quot;wheel&quot;. When looking at the mirror through the holes of one of the wheels in the rotating disc, that wheel seemed to stand still while the others would appear to move with different velocities or opposite direction.

Plateau was inspired by Faraday&#x27;s additional experiments and continued the research. In July 1832 Plateau sent a letter to Faraday and added an experimental circle with apparently abstract figures that produced a &quot;completely immobile image of a little, perfectly regular horse&quot; when rotated in front of a mirror. After several attempts and many difficulties Plateau managed to animate the figures between the slits in a disc when he constructed the first effective model of the phénakisticope in November or December 1832 . Plateau published his then unnamed invention in a January 20, 1833 letter to &quot;Correspondance Mathématique et Physique&quot;.

Simon Stampfer claimed to have independently and almost simultaneously invented his very similar &quot;Stroboscopischen Scheiben oder optischen Zauberscheiben&quot; (stroboscopic discs or optical magic discs) soon after he read about Faraday&#x27;s findings in December 1832.

Stampfer also mentioned several possible variations of his stroboscopic invention, including a cylinder (similar to the later zoetrope) as well as a long, looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers (somewhat similar to film) and a theater-like frame (much like the later praxinoscope). In January 1834, William George Horner also suggested a cylindrical variation of Plateau&#x27;s phénakisticope, but he did not manage to publish a working version. William Ensign Lincoln invented the definitive zoetrope with exchangeable animation strips in 1865 and had it published by Milton Bradley and Co. in December 1866.

==Other theories for motion perception in film==
In his 1833 patent and his explanatory pamphlet for his stroboscopic discs, Simon Stampfer emphasized the importance of the interruptions of the beams of light reflected by the drawings, while a mechanism would transport the images past the eyes at an appropriate speed. The pictures had to be constructed according to certain laws of physics and mathematics, including the systematic division of a movement into separate moments. He described the idea of persistence of vision only as the effect that made the interruptions go unnoticed.

The idea that the motion effects in so-called &quot;optical toys&quot;, like the phénakisticope and the zoetrope, may be caused by images lingering on the retina was questioned in an 1868 article by William Benjamin Carpenter. He suggested that the illusion was &quot;rather a &quot;mental&quot; than a &quot;retinal&quot; phenomenon&quot;.

Early theories of persistence of vision were centered on the retina, while later theories preferred or added ideas about cognitive (brain centered) elements of motion perception. Many psychological concepts of the basic principle of animation suggested that the blanks in between the images were filled in by the mind.

Max Wertheimer proved in 1912 that test subjects did not see anything in between the two different positions in which a figure was projected by a tachistocope at frequencies that were ideal for the illusion of one figure moving from one position to the next. He used the Greek letter φ (phi) to designate illusions of motion. At higher speeds, when test subjects believed to see both positions more or less simultaneously, a moving objectless phenomenon was seen between and around the projected figures. Wertheimer supposed this &quot;pure phi phenomenon&quot; was a more direct sensory experience of motion. The ideal animation illusion of motion across the interval between the figures was later called &quot;beta movement&quot;.

A visual form of memory known as iconic memory has been described as the cause of persistence of vision. Some scientists nowadays consider the entire theory of iconic memory a myth.

When contrasting the theory of persistence of vision with that of phi phenomena, an understanding emerges that the eye &quot;is not a camera&quot; and does not see in frames per second. In other words, vision is not as simple as light registering on a medium since the brain has to make sense of the visual data the eye provides and construct a coherent picture of reality.

Although psychologists and physiologists have rejected the relevance of the theory of retinal persistence film viewership, film academics and theorists generally have not, and it persists in citations in many classic and modern film-theory texts.

Joseph and Barbara Anderson argue that the phi phenomena privileges a more constructionist approach to the cinema (David Bordwell, Noël Carroll, Kirstin Thompson) whereas the persistence of vision privileges a realist approach (André Bazin, Christian Metz, Jean-Louis Baudry).

<text>A propaganda film is a film that involves some form of propaganda. Propaganda films spread and promote certain ideas that are usually religious, political, or cultural in nature. A propaganda film is made with the intent that the viewer will adopt the position promoted by the propagator and eventually take action towards making those ideas widely accepted. Propaganda films are popular mediums of propaganda due to their ability to easily reach a large audience in a short amount of time. They are also able to come in a variety of film types such as documentary, non-fiction, and newsreel, making it even easier to provide subjective content that may be deliberately misleading.

Propaganda is the ability &quot;to produce and spread fertile messages that, once sown, will germinate in large human cultures&quot;. However, in the 20th century, a &quot;new&quot; propaganda emerged, which revolved around political organizations and their need to communicate messages that would &quot;sway relevant groups of people in order to accommodate their agendas&quot;. First developed by the Lumiere brothers in 1896, film provided a unique means of accessing large audiences at once. Film was the first universal mass medium in that it could simultaneously influence viewers as individuals and members of a crowd, which led to it quickly becoming a tool for governments and non-state organizations to project a desired ideological message. As Nancy Snow stated in her book, &quot;Information War: American Propaganda, Free Speech and Opinion Control Since 9-11&quot;, propaganda &quot;begins where critical thinking ends.&quot;

==Tools used in propaganda film==
Film is a unique medium that reproduces images, movement, and sound in a lifelike manner as it fuses meaning with evolvement as time passes in the story depicted. Unlike many other art forms, film produces a sense of immediacy. Film&#x27;s ability to create the illusion of life and reality, allows for it be used as a medium to present alternative ideas or realities making it easy for the viewer to perceive this as an accurate depiction of life.

Some film academics have noted film&#x27;s great illusory abilities. Dziga Vertov claimed in his 1924 manifesto, &quot;The Birth of Kino-Eye&quot; that &quot;the cinema-eye is cinema-truth&quot;. To paraphrase Hilmar Hoffmann, this means that in film, only what the camera &#x27;sees&#x27; exists, and the viewer, lacking alternative perspectives, conventionally takes the image for reality.

=== Rhetoric ===
Making the viewer sympathize with the characters that align with the agenda or message the filmmaker portray is a common rhetorical tool used in propaganda film. Propaganda films exhibit this by having reoccurring themes good vs. evil. The viewer is meant to feel sympathy towards the &quot;good side&quot; while loathing in the &quot;evil side&quot;. Prominent Nazi film maker Joseph Goebbels used this tactic to invoke deep emotions into the audience. Goebbels stressed that while making films full of nationalistic symbols can energize a population, nothing will work better to mobilize a population towards the Nazi cause like &quot;intensifying life&quot;.

==== The Kuleshov Effect ====
After the 1917 October Revolution the newly formed Bolshevik government and its leader Vladimir Lenin placed an emphasis on the need for film as a propaganda tool. Lenin viewed propaganda merely as a way to educate the masses as opposed to a way to evoke emotion and rally the masses towards a political cause. Film became the preferred medium of propaganda in the newly formed Russian Soviet Republic due to a large portion of the peasant population being illiterate.
The Kuleshov Effect was first used in 1919 in the film &quot;The Exposure of the Relics of Sergius of Radonezh&quot; by juxtaposing images of the exhumed coffin and body of Sergius of Radonezh, a prominent Russian saint, and the reaction from the watching audience. The images of the crowd are made up of mostly female faces, whose expressions can be interpreted ambiguously. The idea behind juxtaposing these images was to subvert the audience&#x27;s assumption that the crowd would show emotions of being sad or upset. Instead the crowd could be interpreted to be expressing emotions of boredom, fear, dismay, and a myriad amount of other emotions. There is nothing to prove to the audience that the images of the audience and the exhumed body were captured in the same moment or place (it is now believed the images of the crowd were filmed outdoors while the images showing the skeletal remains were captured indoors). This is what blurs the line of truth making the Kuleshov Effect an effective tool of propaganda.

<doc id="23291" wikidata="Q76259" url="?curid=23291" title="Pliocene">
<text>The Pliocene ( ; also Pleiocene) is the epoch in the geologic time scale that extends from 5.33 to 2.58 million years ago (Ma). It is the second and most recent epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian Stage, which lasted from 2.59 to 1.81 Ma, and is now included in the Pleistocene.

As with other older geologic periods, the geological strata that define the start and end are well-identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain. The boundaries defining the Pliocene are not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer Miocene and the relatively cooler Pleistocene. The upper boundary was set at the start of the Pleistocene glaciations.

==Etymology==
Charles Lyell (later Sir Charles) gave the Pliocene its name in &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; (volume 3, 1833).

The word &quot;pliocene&quot; comes from the Greek words (, &quot;more&quot;) and (, &quot;new&quot; or &quot;recent&quot;) and means roughly &quot;continuation of the recent&quot;, referring to the essentially modern marine mollusc fauna.

==Subdivisions==

In the official timescale of the ICS, the Pliocene is subdivided into two stages. From youngest to oldest they are:

* Piacenzian (3.60–2.58 Ma)
* Zanclean (5.33–3.60 Ma)

The Piacenzian is sometimes referred to as the Late Pliocene, whereas the Zanclean is referred to as the Early Pliocene.

In the system of
* North American Land Mammal Ages (NALMA) include Hemphillian (9–4.75 Ma), and Blancan (4.75–1.6 Ma). The Blancan extends forward into the Pleistocene.
* South American Land Mammal Ages (SALMA) include Montehermosan (6.8–4.0 Ma), Chapadmalalan (4.0–3.0 Ma) and Uquian (3.0–1.2 Ma).

In the Paratethys area (central Europe and parts of western Asia) the Pliocene contains the Dacian (roughly equal to the Zanclean) and Romanian (roughly equal to the Piacenzian and Gelasian together) stages. As usual in stratigraphy, there are many other regional and local subdivisions in use.

In Britain, the Pliocene is divided into the following stages (old to young): Gedgravian, Waltonian, Pre-Ludhamian, Ludhamian, Thurnian, Bramertonian or Antian, Pre-Pastonian or Baventian, Pastonian and Beestonian. In the Netherlands the Pliocene is divided into these stages (old to young): Brunssumian C, Reuverian A, Reuverian B, Reuverian C, Praetiglian, Tiglian A, Tiglian B, Tiglian C1-4b, Tiglian C4c, Tiglian C5, Tiglian C6 and Eburonian. The exact correlations between these local stages and the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) stages is not established.

==Climate==
During the Pliocene epoch (5.3 to 2.6 million years ago (Ma)), the Earth&#x27;s climate became cooler and drier, as well as more seasonal, marking a transition between the relatively warm Miocene to the cooler Pleistocene. However, the beginning of the Pliocene was marked by an increase in global temperatures relative to the cooler Messinian. This increase was related to the 1.2 million year obliquity amplitude modulation cycle. By 3.3-3.0 Ma, during the Mid-Piacenzian Warm Period (mPWP), global average temperature was 2–3 °C higher than today, while carbon dioxide levels were the same as today (400 ppm). Global sea level was about 25 m higher, though its exact value is uncertain. The northern hemisphere ice sheet was ephemeral before the onset of extensive glaciation over Greenland that occurred in the late Pliocene around 3 Ma.
The formation of an Arctic ice cap is signaled by an abrupt shift in oxygen isotope ratios and ice-rafted cobbles in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Ocean beds. Mid-latitude glaciation was probably underway before the end of the epoch. The global cooling that occurred during the Pliocene may have accelerated on the disappearance of forests and the spread of grasslands and savannas.

During the Pliocene the earth climate system response shifted from a period of high frequency-low amplitude oscillation dominated by the 41,000-year period of Earth&#x27;s obliquity to one of low-frequency, high-amplitude oscillation dominated by the 100,000-year period of the orbital eccentricity characteristic of the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles.

During the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, 3.6 to 2.6 Ma, the Arctic was much warmer than it is at the present day (with summer temperatures some 8 °C warmer than today). That is a key finding of research into a lake-sediment core obtained in Eastern Siberia, which is of exceptional importance because it has provided the longest continuous late Cenozoic land-based sedimentary record thus far.

During the late Zanclean, Italy remained relatively warm and humid. Central Asia became more seasonal during the Pliocene, with colder, drier winters and wetter summers, which contributed to an increase in the abundance of plants across the region. In the Loess Plateau, δ13C values of occluded organic matter increased by 2.5% while those of pedogenic carbonate increased by 5% over the course of the Late Miocene and Pliocene, indicating increased aridification. Further aridification of Central Asia was caused by the development of Northern Hemisphere glaciation during the Late Pliocene. A sediment core from the northern South China Sea shows an increase in dust storm activity during the middle Pliocene. The South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM) increased in intensity after 2.95 Ma, likely because of enhanced cross-equatorial pressure caused by the reorganisation of the Indonesian Throughflow.

In the south-central Andes, an arid period occurred from 6.1 to 5.2 Ma, with another occurring from 3.6 to 3.3 Ma. These arid periods are coincident with global cold periods, during which the position of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies shifted northward and disrupted the South American Low Level Jet, which brings moisture to southeastern South America.

From around 3.8 Ma to about 3.3 Ma, North Africa experienced an extended humid period. In northwestern Africa, tropical forests extended up to Cape Blanc during the Zanclean until around 3.5 Ma. During the Piacenzian, from about 3.5 to 2.6 Ma, the region was forested at irregular intervals and contained a significant Saharan palaeoriver until 3.35 Ma, when trade winds began to dominate over fluvial transport of pollen. Around 3.26 Ma, a strong aridification event that was followed by a return to more humid conditions, which was itself followed by another aridification around 2.7 Ma. From 2.6 to 2.4 Ma, vegetation zones began repeatedly shifting latitudinally in response to glacial-interglacial cycles.

The climate of eastern Africa was very similar to what it is today. Unexpectedly, the expansion of grasslands in eastern Africa during this epoch appears to have been decoupled from aridification and not caused by it, as evidenced by their asynchrony.

Southwestern Australia hosted heathlands, shrublands, and woodlands with a greater species diversity compared to today during the Middle and Late Pliocene. Three different aridification events occurred around 2.90, 2.59, and 2.56 Ma, and may have been linked to the onset of continental glaciation in the Arctic, suggesting that vegetation changes in Australia during the Pliocene behaved similarly to during the Late Pleistocene and were likely characterised by comparable cycles of aridity and humidity.

The equatorial Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature gradient was considerably lower than it is today. Mean sea surface temperatures in the east were substantially warmer than today but similar in the west. This condition has been described as a permanent El Niño state, or “El Padre.” Several mechanisms have been proposed for this pattern, including increased tropical cyclone activity.

The extent of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet oscillated at the 40 kyr period of Earth&#x27;s obliquity. Ice sheet collapse occurred when the global average temperature was 3 °C warmer than today and carbon dioxide concentration was at 400 ppmv. This resulted in open waters in the Ross Sea. Global sea-level fluctuation associated with ice-sheet collapse was probably up to 7 meters for the west Antarctic and 3 meters for the east Antarctic. Model simulations are consistent with reconstructed ice-sheet oscillations and suggest a progression from a smaller to a larger West Antarctic ice sheet in the last 5 million years. Intervals of ice sheet collapse were much more common in the early-mid Pliocene (5 Ma – 3 Ma), after three-million-year intervals with modern or glacial ice volume became longer and collapse occurs only at times when warmer global temperature coincide with strong austral summer insolation anomalies.

==Paleogeography==

Continents continued to drift, moving from positions possibly as far as 250 km from their present locations to positions only 70 km from their current locations. South America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene, making possible the Great American Interchange and bringing a nearly complete end to South America&#x27;s distinctive native ungulate fauna, though other South American lineages like its predatory mammals were already extinct by this point and others like xenarthrans continued to do well afterwards. The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters decreasing temperatures in the now-separated Atlantic Ocean.

Africa&#x27;s collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea, cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean. The border between the Miocene and the Pliocene is also the time of the Messinian salinity crisis.

During the Late Pliocene, the Himalayas became less active in their uplift, as evidenced by sedimentation changes in the Bengal Fan.

The land bridge between Alaska and Siberia (Beringia) was first flooded near the start of the Pliocene, allowing marine organisms to spread between the Arctic and Pacific Oceans. The bridge would continue to be periodically flooded and restored thereafter.

Pliocene marine formations are exposed in northeast Spain, southern California, New Zealand, and Italy.

During the Pliocene parts of southern Norway and southern Sweden that had been near sea level rose. In Norway this rise elevated the Hardangervidda plateau to 1200 m in the Early Pliocene. In Southern Sweden similar movements elevated the South Swedish highlands leading to a deflection of the ancient Eridanos river from its original path across south-central Sweden into a course south of Sweden.

==Environment and evolution of human ancestors==
The Pliocene is bookended by two significant events in the evolution of human ancestors. The first is the appearance of the hominin &quot;Australopithecus anamensis&quot; in the early Pliocene, around 4.2 million years ago. The second is the appearance of &quot;Homo&quot;, the genus that includes modern humans and their closest extinct relatives, near the end of the Pliocene at 2.6 million years ago. Key traits that evolved among hominins during the Pliocene include terrestrial bipedality and, by the end of the Pliocene, encephalized brains (brains with a large neocortex relative to body mass and stone tool manufacture.

Improvements in dating methods and in the use of climate proxies have provided scientists with the means to test hypotheses of the evolution of human ancestors. Early hypotheses of the evolution of human traits emphasized the selective pressures produced by particular habitats. For example, many scientists have long favored the savannah hypothesis. This proposes that the evolution of terrestrial bipedality and other traits was an adaptive response to Pliocene climate change that transformed forests into more open savannah. This was championed by Grafton Elliot Smith in his 1924 book, &quot;The Evolution of Man&quot;, as &quot;the unknown world beyond the trees&quot;, and was further elaborated by Raymond Dart as the killer ape theory. Other scientists, such as Sherwood L. Washburn, emphasized an intrinsic model of hominin evolution. According to this model, early evolutionary developments triggered later developments. The model placed little emphasis on the surrounding environment. Anthropologists tended to focus on intrinsic models while geologists and vertebrate paleontologists tended to put greater emphasis on habitats.

Alternatives to the savanna hypothesis include the woodland/forest hypothesis, which emphasizes the evolution of hominins in closed habitats, or hypotheses emphasizing the influence of colder habitats at higher latitudes or the influence of seasonal variation. More recent research has emphasized the variability selection hypothesis, which proposes that variability in climate fostered development of hominin traits. Improved climate proxies show that the Pliocene climate of east Africa was highly variable, suggesting that adaptability to varying conditions was more important in driving hominin evolution than the steady pressure of a particular habitat.

==Flora==

The change to a cooler, drier, more seasonal climate had considerable impacts on Pliocene vegetation, reducing tropical species worldwide. Deciduous forests proliferated, coniferous forests and tundra covered much of the north, and grasslands spread on all continents (except Antarctica). Eastern Africa in particular saw a huge expansion of C4 grasslands. Tropical forests were limited to a tight band around the equator, and in addition to dry savannahs, deserts appeared in Asia and Africa.

==Fauna==

Both marine and continental faunas were essentially modern, although continental faunas were a bit more primitive than today. 

The land mass collisions meant great migration and mixing of previously isolated species, such as in the Great American Interchange. Herbivores got bigger, as did specialized predators.

===Mammals===
In North America, rodents, large mastodons and gomphotheres, and opossums continued successfully, while hoofed animals (ungulates) declined, with camel, deer, and horse all seeing populations recede. Three-toed horses (&quot;Nannippus&quot;), oreodonts, protoceratids, and chalicotheres became extinct. Borophagine dogs and &quot;Agriotherium&quot; became extinct, but other carnivores including the weasel family diversified, and dogs and short-faced bears did well. Ground sloths, huge glyptodonts, and armadillos came north with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. The latitudinal diversity gradient among terrestrial North American mammals became established during this epoch some time after 4 Ma.

In Eurasia rodents did well, while primate distribution declined. Elephants, gomphotheres and stegodonts were successful in Asia (the largest land mammals of the Pliocene were such proboscideans as &quot;Deinotherium&quot;, &quot;Anancus&quot;, and &quot;Mammut borsoni&quot;,) though proboscidean diversity declined significantly during the Late Pliocene. Hyraxes migrated north from Africa. Horse diversity declined, while tapirs and rhinos did fairly well. Bovines and antelopes were successful; some camel species crossed into Asia from North America. Hyenas and early saber-toothed cats appeared, joining other predators including dogs, bears, and weasels.
Africa was dominated by hoofed animals, and primates continued their evolution, with australopithecines (some of the first hominins) and baboon-like monkeys such as the &quot;Dinopithecus&quot; appearing in the late Pliocene. Rodents were successful, and elephant populations increased. Cows and antelopes continued diversification and overtook pigs in numbers of species. Early giraffes appeared. Horses and modern rhinos came onto the scene. Bears, dogs and weasels (originally from North America) joined cats, hyenas and civets as the African predators, forcing hyenas to adapt as specialized scavengers. Most mustelids in Africa declined as a result of increased competition from the new predators, although &quot;Enhydriodon omoensis&quot; remained an unusually successful terrestrial predator.

South America was invaded by North American species for the first time since the Cretaceous, with North American rodents and primates mixing with southern forms. Litopterns and the notoungulates, South American natives, were mostly wiped out, except for the macrauchenids and toxodonts, which managed to survive. Small weasel-like carnivorous mustelids, coatis and short-faced bears migrated from the north. Grazing glyptodonts, browsing giant ground sloths and smaller caviomorph rodents, pampatheres, and armadillos did the opposite, migrating to the north and thriving there.

The marsupials remained the dominant Australian mammals, with herbivore forms including wombats and kangaroos, and the huge &quot;Diprotodon&quot;. Carnivorous marsupials continued hunting in the Pliocene, including dasyurids, the dog-like thylacine and cat-like &quot;Thylacoleo&quot;. The first rodents arrived in Australia. The modern platypus, a monotreme, appeared.

===Birds===

The predatory South American phorusrhacids were rare in this time; among the last was &quot;Titanis&quot;, a large phorusrhacid that migrated to North America and rivaled mammals as top predator. Other birds probably evolved at this time, some modern (such as the genera &quot;Cygnus&quot;, &quot;Bubo&quot;, &quot;Struthio&quot; and &quot;Corvus&quot;), some now extinct.

===Reptiles and amphibians===
Alligators and crocodiles died out in Europe as the climate cooled. Venomous snake genera continued to increase as more rodents and birds evolved. Rattlesnakes first appeared in the Pliocene. The modern species &quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;, having evolved in the Miocene, continued into the Pliocene, except with a more northern range; specimens have been found in very late Miocene deposits of Tennessee. Giant tortoises still thrived in North America, with genera like &quot;Hesperotestudo&quot;. Madtsoid snakes were still present in Australia. The amphibian order Allocaudata became extinct.

=== Bivalves ===
In the Western Atlantic, assemblages of bivalves exhibited remarkable stasis with regards to their basal metabolic rates throughout the various climatic changes of the Pliocene.

===Corals===
The Pliocene was a high water mark for species diversity among Caribbean corals. From 5 to 2 Ma, coral species origination rates were relatively high in the Caribbean, although a noticeable extinction event and drop in diversity occurred at the end of this interval.

==Oceans==

Oceans continued to be relatively warm during the Pliocene, though they continued cooling. The Arctic ice cap formed, drying the climate and increasing cool shallow currents in the North Atlantic. Deep cold currents flowed from the Antarctic.

The formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 3.5 million years ago cut off the final remnant of what was once essentially a circum-equatorial current that had existed since the Cretaceous and the early Cenozoic. This may have contributed to further cooling of the oceans worldwide.

The Pliocene seas were alive with sea cows, seals, sea lions, sharks and whales.
