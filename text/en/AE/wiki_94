<text>Pentecostalism or classical Pentecostalism is a Protestant, Evangelical movement that emphasizes direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit. The term &quot;Pentecostal&quot; is derived from Pentecost, an event that commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks, as described in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2:1–31).

Like other forms of evangelical Protestantism, Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible and the necessity of the New Birth: an individual repenting of their sin and &quot;accepting Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior&quot;. It is distinguished by belief in both the &quot;baptism in the Holy Spirit&quot; and baptism by water, that enables a Christian to &quot;live a Spirit-filled and empowered life&quot;. This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts: such as speaking in tongues and divine healing. Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the Early Church. For this reason, some Pentecostals also use the term &quot;Apostolic&quot; or &quot;Full Gospel&quot; to describe their movement.

Holiness Pentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century among adherents of the Wesleyan-Holiness movement, who were energized by Christian revivalism and expectation of the imminent Second Coming of Christ. Believing that they were living in the end times, they expected God to spiritually renew the Christian Church and bring to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world. In 1900, Charles Parham, an American evangelist and faith healer, began teaching that speaking in tongues was the Biblical evidence of Spirit baptism. Along with William J. Seymour, a Wesleyan-Holiness preacher, he taught that this was the third work of grace. The three-year-long Azusa Street Revival, founded and led by Seymour in Los Angeles, California, resulted in the growth of Pentecostalism throughout the United States and the rest of the world. Visitors carried the Pentecostal experience back to their home churches or felt called to the mission field. While virtually all Pentecostal denominations trace their origins to Azusa Street, the movement has had several divisions and controversies. Early disputes centered on challenges to the doctrine of entire sanctification, and later on, the Holy Trinity. As a result, the Pentecostal movement is divided between Holiness Pentecostals who affirm three definite works of grace, and Finished Work Pentecostals who are partitioned into trinitarian and non-trinitarian branches, the latter giving rise to Oneness Pentecostalism.

Comprising over 700 denominations and many independent churches, Pentecostalism is highly decentralized. No central authority exists, but many denominations are affiliated with the Pentecostal World Fellowship. With over 279 million classical Pentecostals worldwide, the movement is growing in many parts of the world, especially the Global South and Third World countries. Since the 1960s, Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions, and Pentecostal beliefs concerning the baptism of the Holy Spirit and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and Catholic churches through their adherence to the Charismatic movement. Together, worldwide Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity numbers over 644 million adherents. While the movement originally attracted mostly lower classes in the global South, there is a new appeal to middle classes. Middle-class congregations tend to have fewer members. Pentecostalism is believed to be the fastest-growing religious movement in the world.

==History==
===Background===
Early Pentecostals have considered the movement a latter-day restoration of the church&#x27;s apostolic power, and historians such as Cecil M. Robeck Jr. and Edith Blumhofer write that the movement emerged from late 19th-century radical evangelical revival movements in America and in Great Britain.

Within this radical evangelicalism, expressed most strongly in the Wesleyan–holiness and Higher Life movements, themes of restorationism, premillennialism, faith healing, and greater attention on the person and work of the Holy Spirit were central to emerging Pentecostalism. Believing that the second coming of Christ was imminent, these Christians expected an endtime revival of apostolic power, spiritual gifts, and miracle-working. Figures such as Dwight L. Moody and R. A. Torrey began to speak of an experience available to all Christians which would empower believers to evangelize the world, often termed &quot;baptism with the Holy Spirit&quot;.

Certain Christian leaders and movements had important influences on early Pentecostals. The essentially universal belief in the continuation of all the spiritual gifts in the Keswick and Higher Life movements constituted a crucial historical background for the rise of Pentecostalism. Albert Benjamin Simpson (1843–1919) and his Christian and Missionary Alliance (founded in 1887) was very influential in the early years of Pentecostalism, especially on the development of the Assemblies of God. Another early influence on Pentecostals was John Alexander Dowie (1847–1907) and his Christian Catholic Apostolic Church (founded in 1896). Pentecostals embraced the teachings of Simpson, Dowie, Adoniram Judson Gordon (1836–1895) and Maria Woodworth-Etter (1844–1924; she later joined the Pentecostal movement) on healing. Edward Irving&#x27;s Catholic Apostolic Church (founded c. 1831) also displayed many characteristics later found in the Pentecostal revival.

Isolated Christian groups were experiencing charismatic phenomena such as divine healing and speaking in tongues. The Holiness Pentecostal movement provided a theological explanation for what was happening to these Christians, and they adapted a modified form of Wesleyan soteriology to accommodate their new understanding.

===Early revivals: 1900–1929===

Charles Fox Parham, an independent holiness evangelist who believed strongly in divine healing, was an important figure to the emergence of Pentecostalism as a distinct Christian movement. Parham, who was raised as a Methodist, started a spiritual school near Topeka, Kansas in 1900, which he named Bethel Bible School. There he taught that speaking in tongues was the scriptural evidence for the reception of the baptism with the Holy Spirit. On January 1, 1901, after a watch night service, the students prayed for and received the baptism with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues. Parham received this same experience sometime later and began preaching it in all his services. Parham believed this was xenoglossia and that missionaries would no longer need to study foreign languages. Parham closed his Topeka school after 1901 and began a four-year revival tour throughout Kansas and Missouri. He taught that the baptism with the Holy Spirit was a third experience, subsequent to conversion and sanctification. Sanctification cleansed the believer, but Spirit baptism empowered for service.

At about the same time that Parham was spreading his doctrine of initial evidence in the Midwestern United States, news of the Welsh Revival of 1904–1905 ignited intense speculation among radical evangelicals around the world and particularly in the US of a coming move of the Spirit which would renew the entire Christian Church. This revival saw thousands of conversions and also exhibited speaking in tongues.

Parham moved to Houston, Texas in 1905, where he started a Bible training school. One of his students was William J. Seymour, a one-eyed black preacher. Seymour traveled to Los Angeles where his preaching sparked the three-year-long Azusa Street Revival in 1906. The revival first broke out on Monday April 9, 1906 at 214 Bonnie Brae Street and then moved to 312 Azusa Street on Friday, April 14, 1906. Worship at the racially integrated Azusa Mission featured an absence of any order of service. People preached and testified as moved by the Spirit, spoke and sung in tongues, and fell (were slain) in the Spirit. The revival attracted both religious and secular media attention, and thousands of visitors flocked to the mission, carrying the &quot;fire&quot; back to their home churches. Despite the work of various Wesleyan groups such as Parham&#x27;s and D. L. Moody&#x27;s revivals, the beginning of the widespread Pentecostal movement in the US is generally considered to have begun with Seymour&#x27;s Azusa Street Revival.
The crowds of African-Americans and whites worshiping together at William Seymour&#x27;s Azusa Street Mission set the tone for much of the early Pentecostal movement. During the period of 1906–1924, Pentecostals defied social, cultural and political norms of the time that called for racial segregation and the enactment of Jim Crow laws. The Church of God in Christ, the Church of God (Cleveland), the Pentecostal Holiness Church, and the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World were all interracial denominations before the 1920s. These groups, especially in the Jim Crow South were under great pressure to conform to segregation. Ultimately, North American Pentecostalism would divide into white and African-American branches. Though it never entirely disappeared, interracial worship within Pentecostalism would not reemerge as a widespread practice until after the civil rights movement.

Women were vital to the early Pentecostal movement. Believing that whoever received the Pentecostal experience had the responsibility to use it towards the preparation for Christ&#x27;s second coming, Pentecostal women held that the baptism in the Holy Spirit gave them empowerment and justification to engage in activities traditionally denied to them. The first person at Parham&#x27;s Bible college to receive Spirit baptism with the evidence of speaking in tongues was a woman, Agnes Ozman. Women such as Florence Crawford, Ida Robinson, and Aimee Semple McPherson founded new denominations, and many women served as pastors, co-pastors, and missionaries. Women wrote religious songs, edited Pentecostal papers, and taught and ran Bible schools. The unconventionally intense and emotional environment generated in Pentecostal meetings dually promoted, and was itself created by, other forms of participation such as personal testimony and spontaneous prayer and singing. Women did not shy away from engaging in this forum, and in the early movement the majority of converts and church-goers were female. Nevertheless, there was considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of women in the church. The subsiding of the early Pentecostal movement allowed a socially more conservative approach to women to settle in, and, as a result, female participation was channeled into more supportive and traditionally accepted roles. Auxiliary women&#x27;s organizations were created to focus women&#x27;s talents on more traditional activities. Women also became much more likely to be evangelists and missionaries than pastors. When they were pastors, they often co-pastored with their husbands.

The majority of early Pentecostal denominations taught Christian pacifism and adopted military service articles that advocated conscientious objection.

====Spread and opposition====

Azusa participants returned to their homes carrying their new experience with them. In many cases, whole churches were converted to the Pentecostal faith, but many times Pentecostals were forced to establish new religious communities when their experience was rejected by the established churches. One of the first areas of involvement was the African continent, where, by 1907, American missionaries were established in Liberia, as well as in South Africa by 1908. Because speaking in tongues was initially believed to always be actual foreign languages, it was believed that missionaries would no longer have to learn the languages of the peoples they evangelized because the Holy Spirit would provide whatever foreign language was required. (When the majority of missionaries, to their disappointment, learned that tongues speech was unintelligible on the mission field, Pentecostal leaders were forced to modify their understanding of tongues.) Thus, as the experience of speaking in tongues spread, a sense of the immediacy of Christ&#x27;s return took hold, and that energy would be directed into missionary and evangelistic activity. Early Pentecostals saw themselves as outsiders from mainstream society, dedicated solely to preparing the way for Christ&#x27;s return.

An associate of Seymour&#x27;s, Florence Crawford, brought the message to the Northwest, forming what would become the Apostolic Faith Church—a Holiness Pentecostal denomination—by 1908. After 1907, Azusa participant William Howard Durham, pastor of the North Avenue Mission in Chicago, returned to the Midwest to lay the groundwork for the movement in that region. It was from Durham&#x27;s church that future leaders of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada would hear the Pentecostal message. One of the most well known Pentecostal pioneers was Gaston B. Cashwell (the &quot;Apostle of Pentecost&quot; to the South), whose evangelistic work led three Southeastern holiness denominations into the new movement.

The Pentecostal movement, especially in its early stages, was typically associated with the impoverished and marginalized of America, especially African Americans and Southern Whites. With the help of many healing evangelists such as Oral Roberts, Pentecostalism spread across America by the 1950s.


International visitors and Pentecostal missionaries would eventually export the revival to other nations. The first foreign Pentecostal missionaries were Alfred G. Garr and his wife, who were Spirit baptized at Azusa and traveled to India and later Hong Kong. On being Spirit baptized, Garr spoke in Bengali, a language he did not know, and becoming convinced of his call to serve in India came to Calcutta with his wife Lilian and began ministering at the Bow Bazar Baptist Church. The Norwegian Methodist pastor T. B. Barratt was influenced by Seymour during a tour of the United States. By December 1906, he had returned to Europe, and he is credited with beginning the Pentecostal movement in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, France and England. A notable convert of Barratt was Alexander Boddy, the Anglican vicar of All Saints&#x27; in Sunderland, England, who became a founder of British Pentecostalism. Other important converts of Barratt were German minister Jonathan Paul who founded the first German Pentecostal denomination (the Mülheim Association) and Lewi Pethrus, the Swedish Baptist minister who founded the Swedish Pentecostal movement.

Through Durham&#x27;s ministry, Italian immigrant Luigi Francescon received the Pentecostal experience in 1907 and established Italian Pentecostal congregations in the US, Argentina (Christian Assembly in Argentina), and Brazil (Christian Congregation of Brazil). In 1908, Giacomo Lombardi led the first Pentecostal services in Italy. In November 1910, two Swedish Pentecostal missionaries arrived in Belem, Brazil and established what would become the Assembleias de Deus (Assemblies of God of Brazil). In 1908, John G. Lake, a follower of Alexander Dowie who had experienced Pentecostal Spirit baptism, traveled to South Africa and founded what would become the Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa and the Zion Christian Church. As a result of this missionary zeal, practically all Pentecostal denominations today trace their historical roots to the Azusa Street Revival. Eventually, the first missionaries realized that they definitely needed to learn the local language and culture, needed to raise financial support, and develop long-term strategies for the development of indigenous churches.

The first generation of Pentecostal believers faced immense criticism and ostracism from other Christians, most vehemently from the Holiness movement from which they originated. Alma White, leader of the Pillar of Fire Church—a Holiness Methodist denomination, wrote a book against the movement titled &quot;Demons and Tongues&quot; in 1910. She called Pentecostal tongues &quot;satanic gibberish&quot; and Pentecostal services &quot;the climax of demon worship&quot;. Famous Holiness Methodist preacher W. B. Godbey characterized those at Azusa Street as &quot;Satan&#x27;s preachers, jugglers, necromancers, enchanters, magicians, and all sorts of mendicants&quot;. To Dr. G. Campbell Morgan, Pentecostalism was &quot;the last vomit of Satan&quot;, while Dr. R. A. Torrey thought it was &quot;emphatically not of God, and founded by a Sodomite&quot;. The Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene, one of the largest holiness groups, was strongly opposed to the new Pentecostal movement. To avoid confusion, the church changed its name in 1919 to the Church of the Nazarene.

A. B. Simpson&#x27;s Christian and Missionary Alliance—a Keswickian denomination—negotiated a compromise position unique for the time. Simpson believed that Pentecostal tongues speaking was a legitimate manifestation of the Holy Spirit, but he did not believe it was a necessary evidence of Spirit baptism. This view on speaking in tongues ultimately led to what became known as the &quot;Alliance position&quot; articulated by A. W. Tozer as &quot;seek not—forbid not&quot;.

====Early controversies====
The first Pentecostal converts were mainly derived from the Holiness movement and adhered to a Wesleyan understanding of entire sanctification as a definite, instantaneous experience and second work of grace. Problems with this view arose when large numbers of converts entered the movement from non-Wesleyan backgrounds, especially from Baptist churches. In 1910, William Durham of Chicago first articulated the Finished Work, a doctrine which located sanctification at the moment of salvation and held that after conversion the Christian would progressively grow in grace in a lifelong process. This teaching polarized the Pentecostal movement into two factions: Holiness Pentecostalism and Finished Work Pentecostalism. The Wesleyan doctrine was strongest in the Apostolic Faith Church, which views itself as being the successor of the Azusa Street Revival, as well as in the Calvary Holiness Association, Congregational Holiness Church, Church of God (Cleveland), Church of God in Christ, Free Gospel Church and the Pentecostal Holiness Church; these bodies are classed as Holiness Pentecostal denominations. The Finished Work, however, would ultimately gain ascendancy among Pentecostals, in denominations such as the Assemblies of God, which was the first Finished Work Pentecostal denomination. After 1911, most new Pentecostal denominations would adhere to Finished Work sanctification.

In 1914, a group of 300 predominately white Pentecostal ministers and laymen from all regions of the United States gathered in Hot Springs, Arkansas, to create a new, national Pentecostal fellowship—the General Council of the Assemblies of God. By 1911, many of these white ministers were distancing themselves from an existing arrangement under an African-American leader. Many of these white ministers were licensed by the African-American, C. H. Mason under the auspices of the Church of God in Christ, one of the few legally chartered Pentecostal organizations at the time credentialing and licensing ordained Pentecostal clergy. To further such distance, Bishop Mason and other African-American Pentecostal leaders were not invited to the initial 1914 fellowship of Pentecostal ministers. These predominately white ministers adopted a congregational polity, whereas the COGIC and other Southern groups remained largely episcopal and rejected a Finished Work understanding of Sanctification. Thus, the creation of the Assemblies of God marked an official end of Pentecostal doctrinal unity and racial integration.

Among these Finished Work Pentecostals, the new Assemblies of God would soon face a &quot;new issue&quot; which first emerged at a 1913 camp meeting. During a baptism service, the speaker, R. E. McAlister, mentioned that the Apostles baptized converts once in the name of Jesus Christ, and the words &quot;Father, Son, and Holy Ghost&quot; were never used in baptism. This inspired Frank Ewart who claimed to have received as a divine prophecy revealing a nontrinitarian conception of God. Ewart believed that there was only one personality in the Godhead—Jesus Christ. The terms &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; were titles designating different aspects of Christ. Those who had been baptized in the Trinitarian fashion needed to submit to rebaptism in Jesus&#x27; name. Furthermore, Ewart believed that Jesus&#x27; name baptism and the gift of tongues were essential for salvation. Ewart and those who adopted his belief, which is known as Oneness Pentecostalism, called themselves &quot;oneness&quot; or &quot;Jesus&#x27; Name&quot; Pentecostals, but their opponents called them &quot;Jesus Only&quot;.

Amid great controversy, the Assemblies of God rejected the Oneness teaching, and many of its churches and pastors were forced to withdraw from the denomination in 1916. They organized their own Oneness groups. Most of these joined Garfield T. Haywood, an African-American preacher from Indianapolis, to form the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. This church maintained an interracial identity until 1924 when the white ministers withdrew to form the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated. This church later merged with another group forming the United Pentecostal Church International. This controversy among the Finished Work Pentecostals caused Holiness Pentecostals to further distance themselves from Finished Work Pentecostals, who they viewed as heretical.

===1930–1959===
While Pentecostals shared many basic assumptions with conservative Protestants, the earliest Pentecostals were rejected by Fundamentalist Christians who adhered to cessationism. In 1928, the World Christian Fundamentals Association labeled Pentecostalism &quot;fanatical&quot; and &quot;unscriptural&quot;. By the early 1940s, this rejection of Pentecostals was giving way to a new cooperation between them and leaders of the &quot;new evangelicalism&quot;, and American Pentecostals were involved in the founding of the 1942 National Association of Evangelicals. Pentecostal denominations also began to interact with each other both on national levels and international levels through the Pentecostal World Fellowship, which was founded in 1947.

Some Pentecostal churches in Europe, especially in Italy and Germany, during the war were also victims of the Holocaust. Because of their tongues speaking their members were considered mentally ill, and many pastors were sent either to confinement or to concentration camps.

Though Pentecostals began to find acceptance among evangelicals in the 1940s, the previous decade was widely viewed as a time of spiritual dryness, when healings and other miraculous phenomena were perceived as being less prevalent than in earlier decades of the movement. It was in this environment that the Latter Rain Movement, the most important controversy to affect Pentecostalism since World War II, began in North America and spread around the world in the late 1940s. Latter Rain leaders taught the restoration of the fivefold ministry led by apostles. These apostles were believed capable of imparting spiritual gifts through the laying on of hands. There were prominent participants of the early Pentecostal revivals, such as Stanley Frodsham and Lewi Pethrus, who endorsed the movement citing similarities to early Pentecostalism. However, Pentecostal denominations were critical of the movement and condemned many of its practices as unscriptural. One reason for the conflict with the denominations was the sectarianism of Latter Rain adherents. Many autonomous churches were birthed out of the revival.

A simultaneous development within Pentecostalism was the postwar Healing Revival. Led by healing evangelists William Branham, Oral Roberts, Gordon Lindsay, and T. L. Osborn, the Healing Revival developed a following among non-Pentecostals as well as Pentecostals. Many of these non-Pentecostals were baptized in the Holy Spirit through these ministries. The Latter Rain and the Healing Revival influenced many leaders of the charismatic movement of the 1960s and 1970s.

===1960–present===
Before the 1960s, most non-Pentecostal Christians who experienced the Pentecostal baptism in the Holy Spirit typically kept their experience a private matter or joined a Pentecostal church afterward. The 1960s saw a new pattern develop where large numbers of Spirit baptized Christians from mainline churches in the US, Europe, and other parts of the world chose to remain and work for spiritual renewal within their traditional churches. This initially became known as New or Neo-Pentecostalism (in contrast to the older classical Pentecostalism) but eventually became known as the Charismatic Movement. While cautiously supportive of the Charismatic Movement, the failure of Charismatics to embrace traditional Pentecostal teachings, such as the prohibition of dancing, abstinence from alcohol and other drugs such as tobacco, as well as restrictions on dress and appearance following the doctrine of outward holiness, initiated an identity crisis for classical Pentecostals, who were forced to reexamine long held assumptions about what it meant to be Spirit filled. The liberalizing influence of the Charismatic Movement on classical Pentecostalism can be seen in the disappearance of many of these taboos since the 1960s, apart from certain Holiness Pentecostal denominations, such as the Apostolic Faith Church, which maintain these standards of outward holiness. Because of this, the cultural differences between classical Pentecostals and charismatics have lessened over time. The global renewal movements manifest many of these tensions as inherent characteristics of Pentecostalism and as representative of the character of global Christianity.

==Beliefs==

Pentecostalism is an evangelical faith, emphasizing the reliability of the Bible and the need for the transformation of an individual&#x27;s life through faith in Jesus. Like other evangelicals, Pentecostals generally adhere to the Bible&#x27;s divine inspiration and inerrancy—the belief that the Bible, in the original manuscripts in which it was written, is without error. Pentecostals emphasize the teaching of the &quot;full gospel&quot; or &quot;foursquare gospel&quot;. The term &quot;foursquare&quot; refers to the four fundamental beliefs of Pentecostalism: Jesus saves according to John 3:16; baptizes with the Holy Spirit according to Acts 2:4; heals bodily according to James 5:15; and is coming again to receive those who are saved according to 1 Thessalonians 4:16–17.

===Salvation===

The central belief of classical Pentecostalism is that through the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, sins can be forgiven and humanity reconciled with God. This is the Gospel or &quot;good news&quot;. The fundamental requirement of Pentecostalism is that one be born again. The new birth is received by the grace of God through faith in Christ as Lord and Savior. In being born again, the believer is regenerated, justified, adopted into the family of God, and the Holy Spirit&#x27;s work of sanctification is initiated.

Classical Pentecostal soteriology is generally Arminian rather than Calvinist. The security of the believer is a doctrine held within Pentecostalism; nevertheless, this security is conditional upon continual faith and repentance. Pentecostals believe in both a literal heaven and hell, the former for those who have accepted God&#x27;s gift of salvation and the latter for those who have rejected it.

For most Pentecostals there is no other requirement to receive salvation. Baptism with the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues are not generally required, though Pentecostal converts are usually encouraged to seek these experiences. A notable exception is Jesus&#x27; Name Pentecostalism, most adherents of which believe both water baptism and Spirit baptism are integral components of salvation.

===Baptism with the Holy Spirit===

Pentecostals identify three distinct uses of the word &quot;baptism&quot; in the New Testament:

* Baptism into the body of Christ: This refers to salvation. Every believer in Christ is made a part of his body, the Church, through baptism. The Holy Spirit is the agent, and the body of Christ is the medium.
* Water baptism: Symbolic of dying to the world and living in Christ, water baptism is an outward symbolic expression of that which has already been accomplished by the Holy Spirit, namely baptism into the body of Christ.
* Baptism with the Holy Spirit: This is an experience distinct from baptism into the body of Christ. In this baptism, Christ is the agent and the Holy Spirit is the medium.

While the figure of Jesus Christ and his redemptive work are at the center of Pentecostal theology, that redemptive work is believed to provide for a fullness of the Holy Spirit of which believers in Christ may take advantage. The majority of Pentecostals believe that at the moment a person is born again, the new believer has the presence (indwelling) of the Holy Spirit. While the Spirit &quot;dwells&quot; in every Christian, Pentecostals believe that all Christians should seek to be &quot;filled&quot; with him. The Spirit&#x27;s &quot;filling&quot;, &quot;falling upon&quot;, &quot;coming upon&quot;, or being &quot;poured out upon&quot; believers is called the baptism with the Holy Spirit. Pentecostals define it as a definite experience occurring after salvation whereby the Holy Spirit comes upon the believer to anoint and empower them for special service. It has also been described as &quot;a baptism into the love of God&quot;.

The main purpose of the experience is to grant power for Christian service. Other purposes include power for spiritual warfare (the Christian struggles against spiritual enemies and thus requires spiritual power), power for overflow (the believer&#x27;s experience of the presence and power of God in their life flows out into the lives of others), and power for ability (to follow divine direction, to face persecution, to exercise spiritual gifts for the edification of the church, etc.).

Pentecostals believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is available to all Christians. Repentance from sin and being born again are fundamental requirements to receive it. There must also be in the believer a deep conviction of needing more of God in their life, and a measure of consecration by which the believer yields themself to the will of God. Citing instances in the Book of Acts where believers were Spirit baptized before they were baptized with water, most Pentecostals believe a Christian need not have been baptized in water to receive Spirit baptism. However, Pentecostals do believe that the biblical pattern is &quot;repentance, regeneration, water baptism, and then the baptism with the Holy Ghost&quot;. There are Pentecostal believers who have claimed to receive their baptism with the Holy Spirit while being water baptized.

It is received by having faith in God&#x27;s promise to fill the believer and in yielding the entire being to Christ. Certain conditions, if present in a believer&#x27;s life, could cause delay in receiving Spirit baptism, such as &quot;weak faith, unholy living, imperfect consecration, and egocentric motives&quot;. In the absence of these, Pentecostals teach that seekers should maintain a persistent faith in the knowledge that God will fulfill his promise. For Pentecostals, there is no prescribed manner in which a believer will be filled with the Spirit. It could be expected or unexpected, during public or private prayer.

Pentecostals expect certain results following baptism with the Holy Spirit. Some of these are immediate while others are enduring or permanent. Most Pentecostal denominations teach that speaking in tongues is an immediate or initial physical evidence that one has received the experience. Some teach that any of the gifts of the Spirit can be evidence of having received Spirit baptism. Other immediate evidences include giving God praise, having joy, and desiring to testify about Jesus. Enduring or permanent results in the believer&#x27;s life include Christ glorified and revealed in a greater way, a &quot;deeper passion for souls&quot;, greater power to witness to nonbelievers, a more effective prayer life, greater love for and insight into the Bible, and the manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit.

Holiness Pentecostals, with their background in the Wesleyan-Holiness movement, historically teach that baptism with the Holy Spirit, as evidenced by glossolalia, is the third work of grace, which follows the new birth (first work of grace) and entire sanctification (second work of grace).

While the baptism with the Holy Spirit is a definite experience in a believer&#x27;s life, Pentecostals view it as just the beginning of living a Spirit-filled life. Pentecostal teaching stresses the importance of continually being filled with the Spirit. There is only one baptism with the Spirit, but there should be many infillings with the Spirit throughout the believer&#x27;s life.

===Divine healing===
Pentecostalism is a holistic faith, and the belief that Jesus is Healer is one quarter of the full gospel. Pentecostals cite four major reasons for believing in divine healing: 1) it is reported in the Bible, 2) Jesus&#x27; healing ministry is included in his atonement (thus divine healing is part of salvation), 3) &quot;the whole gospel is for the whole person&quot;—spirit, soul, and body, 4) sickness is a consequence of the Fall of Man and salvation is ultimately the restoration of the fallen world. In the words of Pentecostal scholar Vernon L. Purdy, &quot;Because sin leads to human suffering, it was only natural for the Early Church to understand the ministry of Christ as the alleviation of human suffering, since he was God&#x27;s answer to sin ... The restoration of fellowship with God is the most important thing, but this restoration not only results in spiritual healing but many times in physical healing as well.&quot; In the book &quot;In Pursuit of Wholeness: Experiencing God&#x27;s Salvation for the Total Person&quot;, Pentecostal writer and Church historian Wilfred Graves Jr. describes the healing of the body as a physical expression of salvation.

For Pentecostals, spiritual and physical healing serves as a reminder and testimony to Christ&#x27;s future return when his people will be completely delivered from all the consequences of the fall. However, not everyone receives healing when they pray. It is God in his sovereign wisdom who either grants or withholds healing. Common reasons that are given in answer to the question as to why all are not healed include: God teaches through suffering, healing is not always immediate, lack of faith on the part of the person needing healing, and personal sin in one&#x27;s life (however, this does not mean that all illness is caused by personal sin). Regarding healing and prayer Purdy states:

Pentecostals believe that prayer and faith are central in receiving healing. Pentecostals look to scriptures such as James 5:13–16 for direction regarding healing prayer. One can pray for one&#x27;s own healing (verse 13) and for the healing of others (verse 16); no special gift or clerical status is necessary. Verses 14–16 supply the framework for congregational healing prayer. The sick person expresses their faith by calling for the elders of the church who pray over and anoint the sick with olive oil. The oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit.

Besides prayer, there are other ways in which Pentecostals believe healing can be received. One way is based on Mark 16:17–18 and involves believers laying hands on the sick. This is done in imitation of Jesus who often healed in this manner. Another method that is found in some Pentecostal churches is based on the account in Acts 19:11–12 where people were healed when given handkerchiefs or aprons worn by the Apostle Paul. This practice is described by Duffield and Van Cleave in &quot;Foundations of Pentecostal Theology&quot;:

During the initial decades of the movement, Pentecostals thought it was sinful to take medicine or receive care from doctors. Over time, Pentecostals moderated their views concerning medicine and doctor visits; however, a minority of Pentecostal churches continues to rely exclusively on prayer and divine healing. For example, doctors in the United Kingdom reported that a minority of Pentecostal HIV patients were encouraged to stop taking their medicines and parents were told to stop giving medicine to their children, trends that placed lives at risk.

===Eschatology===
The last element of the gospel is that Jesus is the &quot;Soon Coming King&quot;. For Pentecostals, &quot;every moment is eschatological&quot; since at any time Christ may return. This &quot;personal and imminent&quot; Second Coming is for Pentecostals the motivation for practical Christian living including: personal holiness, meeting together for worship, faithful Christian service, and evangelism (both personal and worldwide). Globally, Pentecostal attitudes to the End Times range from enthusiastic participation in the prophecy subculture to a complete lack of interest through to the more recent, optimistic belief in the coming restoration of God&#x27;s kingdom.

Historically, however, they have been premillennial dispensationalists believing in a pretribulation rapture. Pre-tribulation rapture theology was popularized extensively in the 1830s by John Nelson Darby, and further popularized in the United States in the early 20th century by the wide circulation of the Scofield Reference Bible.

===Spiritual gifts===
Pentecostals are continuationists, meaning they believe that all of the spiritual gifts, including the miraculous or &quot;sign gifts&quot;, found in 1 Corinthians 12:4–11, 12:27–31, Romans 12:3–8, and Ephesians 4:7–16 continue to operate within the Church in the present time. Pentecostals place the gifts of the Spirit in context with the fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit is the result of the new birth and continuing to abide in Christ. It is by the fruit exhibited that spiritual character is assessed. Spiritual gifts are received as a result of the baptism with the Holy Spirit. As gifts freely given by the Holy Spirit, they cannot be earned or merited, and they are not appropriate criteria with which to evaluate one&#x27;s spiritual life or maturity. Pentecostals see in the biblical writings of Paul an emphasis on having both character and power, exercising the gifts in love.

Just as fruit should be evident in the life of every Christian, Pentecostals believe that every Spirit-filled believer is given some capacity for the manifestation of the Spirit. The exercise of a gift is considered to be a manifestation of the Spirit, not of the gifted person, and though the gifts operate through people, they are primarily gifts given to the Church. They are valuable only when they minister spiritual profit and edification to the body of Christ. Pentecostal writers point out that the lists of spiritual gifts in the New Testament do not seem to be exhaustive. It is generally believed that there are as many gifts as there are useful ministries and functions in the Church. A spiritual gift is often exercised in partnership with another gift. For example, in a Pentecostal church service, the gift of tongues might be exercised followed by the operation of the gift of interpretation.

According to Pentecostals, all manifestations of the Spirit are to be judged by the church. This is made possible, in part, by the gift of discerning of spirits, which is the capacity for discerning the source of a spiritual manifestation—whether from the Holy Spirit, an evil spirit, or from the human spirit. While Pentecostals believe in the current operation of all the spiritual gifts within the church, their teaching on some of these gifts has generated more controversy and interest than others. There are different ways in which the gifts have been grouped. W. R. Jones suggests three categories, illumination (Word of Wisdom, word of knowledge, discerning of spirits), action (Faith, working of miracles and gifts of healings) and communication (Prophecy, tongues and interpretation of tongues). Duffield and Van Cleave use two categories: the vocal and the power gifts.

====Vocal gifts====
The gifts of prophecy, tongues, interpretation of tongues, and words of wisdom and knowledge are called the vocal gifts. Pentecostals look to 1 Corinthians 14 for instructions on the proper use of the spiritual gifts, especially the vocal ones. Pentecostals believe that prophecy is the vocal gift of preference, a view derived from 1 Corinthians 14. Some teach that the gift of tongues is equal to the gift of prophecy when tongues are interpreted. Prophetic and glossolalic utterances are not to replace the preaching of the Word of God nor to be considered as equal to or superseding the written Word of God, which is the final authority for determining teaching and doctrine.

=====Word of wisdom and word of knowledge=====

Pentecostals understand the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge to be supernatural revelations of wisdom and knowledge by the Holy Spirit. The word of wisdom is defined as a revelation of the Holy Spirit that applies scriptural wisdom to a specific situation that a Christian community faces. The word of knowledge is often defined as the ability of one person to know what God is currently doing or intends to do in the life of another person.

=====Prophecy=====

Pentecostals agree with the Protestant principle of &quot;sola Scriptura&quot;. The Bible is the &quot;all sufficient rule for faith and practice&quot;; it is &quot;fixed, finished, and objective revelation&quot;. Alongside this high regard for the authority of scripture is a belief that the gift of prophecy continues to operate within the Church. Pentecostal theologians Duffield and van Cleave described the gift of prophecy in the following manner: &quot;Normally, in the operation of the gift of prophecy, the Spirit heavily anoints the believer to speak forth to the body not premeditated words, but words the Spirit supplies spontaneously in order to uplift and encourage, incite to faithful obedience and service, and to bring comfort and consolation.&quot;

Any Spirit-filled Christian, according to Pentecostal theology, has the potential, as with all the gifts, to prophesy. Sometimes, prophecy can overlap with preaching &quot;where great unpremeditated truth or application is provided by the Spirit, or where special revelation is given beforehand in prayer and is empowered in the delivery&quot;.

While a prophetic utterance at times might foretell future events, this is not the primary purpose of Pentecostal prophecy and is never to be used for personal guidance. For Pentecostals, prophetic utterances are fallible, i.e. subject to error. Pentecostals teach that believers must discern whether the utterance has edifying value for themselves and the local church. Because prophecies are subject to the judgement and discernment of other Christians, most Pentecostals teach that prophetic utterances should never be spoken in the first person (e.g. &quot;I, the Lord&quot;) but always in the third person (e.g. &quot;Thus saith the Lord&quot; or &quot;The Lord would have...&quot;).

=====Tongues and interpretation=====

A Pentecostal believer in a spiritual experience may vocalize fluent, unintelligible utterances (glossolalia) or articulate a natural language previously unknown to them (xenoglossy). Commonly termed &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;, this vocal phenomenon is believed by Pentecostals to include an endless variety of languages. According to Pentecostal theology, the language spoken (1) may be an unlearned human language, such as the Bible claims happened on the Day of Pentecost, or (2) it might be of heavenly (angelic) origin. In the first case, tongues could work as a sign by which witness is given to the unsaved. In the second case, tongues are used for praise and prayer when the mind is superseded and &quot;the speaker in tongues speaks to God, speaks mysteries, and ... no one understands him&quot;.

Within Pentecostalism, there is a belief that speaking in tongues serves two functions. Tongues as the &quot;initial evidence&quot; of the third work of grace, baptism with the Holy Spirit, and in individual prayer serves a different purpose than tongues as a spiritual gift. All Spirit-filled believers, according to initial evidence proponents, will speak in tongues when baptized in the Spirit and, thereafter, will be able to express prayer and praise to God in an unknown tongue. This type of tongue speaking forms an important part of many Pentecostals&#x27; personal daily devotions. When used in this way, it is referred to as a &quot;prayer language&quot; as the believer is speaking unknown languages not for the purpose of communicating with others but for &quot;communication between the soul and God&quot;. Its purpose is for the spiritual edification of the individual. Pentecostals believe the private use of tongues in prayer (i.e. &quot;prayer in the Spirit&quot;) &quot;promotes a deepening of the prayer life and the spiritual development of the personality&quot;. From Romans 8:26–27, Pentecostals believe that the Spirit intercedes for believers through tongues; in other words, when a believer prays in an unknown tongue, the Holy Spirit is supernaturally directing the believer&#x27;s prayer.

Besides acting as a prayer language, tongues also function as the &quot;gift of tongues&quot;. Not all Spirit-filled believers possess the gift of tongues. Its purpose is for gifted persons to publicly &quot;speak with God in praise, to pray or sing in the Spirit, or to speak forth in the congregation&quot;. There is a division among Pentecostals on the relationship between the gifts of tongues and prophecy. One school of thought believes that the gift of tongues is always directed from man to God, in which case it is always prayer or praise spoken to God but in the hearing of the entire congregation for encouragement and consolation. Another school of thought believes that the gift of tongues can be prophetic, in which case the believer delivers a &quot;message in tongues&quot;—a prophetic utterance given under the influence of the Holy Spirit—to a congregation.

Whether prophetic or not, however, Pentecostals are agreed that all public utterances in an unknown tongue must be interpreted in the language of the gathered Christians. This is accomplished by the gift of interpretation, and this gift can be exercised by the same individual who first delivered the message (if he or she possesses the gift of interpretation) or by another individual who possesses the required gift. If a person with the gift of tongues is not sure that a person with the gift of interpretation is present and is unable to interpret the utterance themself, then the person should not speak. Pentecostals teach that those with the gift of tongues should pray for the gift of interpretation. Pentecostals do not require that an interpretation be a literal word-for-word translation of a glossolalic utterance. Rather, as the word &quot;interpretation&quot; implies, Pentecostals expect only an accurate explanation of the utterance&#x27;s meaning.

Besides the gift of tongues, Pentecostals may also use glossolalia as a form of praise and worship in corporate settings. Pentecostals in a church service may pray aloud in tongues while others pray simultaneously in the common language of the gathered Christians. This use of glossolalia is seen as an acceptable form of prayer and therefore requires no interpretation. Congregations may also corporately sing in tongues, a phenomenon known as singing in the Spirit.

Speaking in tongues is not universal among Pentecostal Christians. In 2006, a ten-country survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that 49 percent of Pentecostals in the US, 50 percent in Brazil, 41 percent in South Africa, and 54 percent in India said they &quot;never&quot; speak or pray in tongues.

====Power gifts====
The gifts of power are distinct from the vocal gifts in that they do not involve utterance. Included in this category are the gift of faith, gifts of healing, and the gift of miracles. The gift of faith (sometimes called &quot;special&quot; faith) is different from &quot;saving faith&quot; and normal Christian faith in its degree and application. This type of faith is a manifestation of the Spirit granted only to certain individuals &quot;in times of special crisis or opportunity&quot; and endues them with &quot;a divine certainty ... that triumphs over everything&quot;. It is sometimes called the &quot;faith of miracles&quot; and is fundamental to the operation of the other two power gifts.

=== Trinitarianism and Oneness ===
During the 1910s, the Finished Work Pentecostal movement split over the nature of the Godhead into two camps – Trinitarian and Oneness. The Oneness doctrine viewed the doctrine of the Trinity as polytheistic.

The majority of Pentecostal denominations believe in the doctrine of the Trinity, which is considered by them to be Christian orthodoxy; these include Holiness Pentecostals and Finished Work Pentecostals. Oneness Pentecostals are nontrinitarian Christians, believing in the Oneness theology about God.

In Oneness theology, the Godhead is not three persons united by one substance, but one God who reveals himself in three different modes. Thus, God relates himself to humanity as our Father within creation, he manifests himself in human form as the Son by virtue of his incarnation as Jesus Christ (), and he is the Holy Spirit () by way of his activity in the life of the believer. Oneness Pentecostals believe that Jesus is the name of God and therefore baptize in the name of Jesus Christ as performed by the apostles ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:38|Acts 2:38]), fulfilling the instructions left by Jesus Christ in the [[Great Commission]] (), they believe that Jesus is the only name given to mankind by which we must be saved ().

The Oneness doctrine may be considered a form of [[Modalism]], an ancient teaching considered [[heresy]] by the Roman Catholic Church and other trinitarian denominations. In contrast, Trinitarian Pentecostals hold to the doctrine of the Trinity, that is, the Godhead is not seen as simply three modes or titles of God manifest at different points in history, but is constituted of three completely distinct persons who are co-eternal with each other and united as one substance. The Son is from all eternity who became incarnate as Jesus, and likewise the Holy Spirit is from all eternity, and both are with the eternal Father from all eternity.

==Worship==
Traditional Pentecostal worship has been described as a &quot;gestalt made up of prayer, singing, sermon, the operation of the gifts of the Spirit, altar intercession, offering, announcements, testimonies, musical specials, Scripture reading, and occasionally the Lord&#x27;s supper&quot;. Russell P. Spittler identified five values that govern Pentecostal [[spirituality]]. The first was individual experience, which emphasizes the Holy Spirit&#x27;s personal work in the life of the believer. Second was [[orality]], a feature that might explain Pentecostalism&#x27;s success in evangelizing nonliterate cultures. The third was spontaneity; members of Pentecostal congregations are expected to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, sometimes resulting in unpredictable services. The fourth value governing Pentecostal spirituality was &quot;otherworldliness&quot; or [[asceticism]], which was partly informed by Pentecostal eschatology. The final and fifth value was a commitment to biblical authority, and many of the distinctive practices of Pentecostals are derived from a [[Biblical literalism|literal reading of scripture]].

Spontaneity is a characteristic element of Pentecostal worship. This was especially true in the movement&#x27;s earlier history, when anyone could initiate a song, chorus, or spiritual gift. Even as Pentecostalism has become more organized and formal, with more control exerted over services, the concept of spontaneity has retained an important place within the movement and continues to inform stereotypical imagery, such as the derogatory &quot;[[holy roller]]&quot;. The phrase &quot;Quench not the Spirit&quot;, derived from 1 Thessalonians 5:19, is used commonly and captures the thought behind Pentecostal spontaneity.

Prayer plays an important role in Pentecostal worship. Collective oral prayer, whether glossolalic or in the vernacular or a mix of both, is common. While praying, individuals may lay hands on a person in need of prayer, or they may raise their hands in response to biblical commands ([[1 Timothy]] 2:8). The raising of hands (which itself is a revival of the ancient [[orans]] posture) is an example of some Pentecostal worship practices that have been widely adopted by the larger Christian world. Pentecostal musical and liturgical practice have also played an influential role in shaping [[contemporary worship]] trends, popularized by the leading producers of Christian music from artists such as [[Chris Tomlin]], [[Michael W. Smith]], [[Zach Williams (musician)|Zach Williams]], [[Darlene Zschech]], [[Matt Maher]], [[Phil Wickham]], Grace Larson, [[Don Moen]] and bands such as [[Hillsong Worship]], Bethel Worship, [[Jesus Culture]] and [[Sovereign Grace Churches|Sovereign Grace Music]].

Several spontaneous practices have become characteristic of Pentecostal worship. Being &quot;[[slain in the Spirit]]&quot; or &quot;falling under the power&quot; is a form of [[prostration]] in which a person falls backwards, as if fainting, while being prayed over. It is at times accompanied by glossolalic prayer; at other times, the person is silent. It is believed by Pentecostals to be caused by &quot;an overwhelming experience of the presence of God&quot;, and Pentecostals sometimes receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit in this posture. Another spontaneous practice is &quot;dancing in the Spirit&quot;. This is when a person leaves their seat &quot;spontaneously &#x27;dancing&#x27; with eyes closed without bumping into nearby persons or objects&quot;. It is explained as the worshipper becoming &quot;so enraptured with God&#x27;s presence that the Spirit takes control of physical motions as well as the spiritual and emotional being&quot;. Pentecostals derive biblical precedent for dancing in worship from [[2 Samuel]] 6, where [[David]] danced before the Lord. A similar occurrence is often called &quot;[[running the aisles]]&quot;. The &quot;Jericho march&quot; (inspired by [[Book of Joshua]] 6:1–27) is a celebratory practice occurring at times of high enthusiasm. Members of a congregation began to spontaneously leave their seats and walk in the aisles inviting other members as they go. Eventually, a full column forms around the perimeter of the meeting space as worshipers march with singing and loud shouts of praise and jubilation. Another spontaneous manifestation found in some Pentecostal churches is [[holy laughter]], in which worshippers uncontrollably laugh. In some Pentecostal churches, these spontaneous expressions are primarily found in revival services (especially those that occur at [[tent revival]]s and [[camp meeting]]s) or special prayer meetings, being rare or non-existent in the main services.

===Ordinances===
Like other Christian churches, Pentecostals believe that certain rituals or ceremonies were instituted as a pattern and command by Jesus in the New Testament. Pentecostals commonly call these ceremonies [[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinances]]. Many Christians call these [[sacraments]], but this term is not generally used by Pentecostals and certain other Protestants as they do not see ordinances as imparting grace. Instead the term [[sacerdotal]] ordinance is used to denote the distinctive belief that grace is received directly from God by the congregant with the officiant serving only to facilitate rather than acting as a [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] or [[vicar]].

The ordinance of water [[baptism]] is an outward symbol of an inner conversion that has already taken place. Therefore, most Pentecostal groups practice [[believer&#x27;s baptism]] by [[immersion baptism|immersion]]. The majority of Pentecostals do not view baptism as essential for salvation, and likewise, most Pentecostals are Trinitarian and use the traditional Trinitarian baptismal formula. However, Oneness Pentecostals view baptism as an essential and necessary part of the salvation experience and, as non-Trinitarians, reject the use of the traditional baptismal formula. For more information on Oneness Pentecostal baptismal beliefs, see the following section on Statistics and denominations.

The ordinance of [[Holy Communion]], or the Lord&#x27;s Supper, is seen as a direct command given by Jesus at the [[Last Supper]], to be done in remembrance of him. Pentecostal denominations, who traditionally support the [[temperance movement]], reject the use of wine as part of communion, using grape juice instead.

Certain Pentecostal denominations observe the [[ordinance (Christianity)|ordinance]] of [[Christian head covering|women&#x27;s headcovering]] in obedience to .

[[Maundy (foot washing)|Foot washing]] is also held as an ordinance by some Pentecostals. It is considered an &quot;ordinance of humility&quot; because Jesus showed humility when washing his disciples&#x27; feet in John 13:14–17. Other Pentecostals do not consider it an ordinance; however, they may still recognize spiritual value in the practice.

==Statistics and denominations==

According to various scholars and sources, Pentecostalism is the fastest-growing [[religious movement]] in the world; this growth is primarily due to [[Conversion to Christianity|religious conversion to Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity]]. According to [[Pulitzer Center]] 35,000 people become Pentecostal or &quot;[[Born again]]&quot; every day. According to scholar Keith Smith of [[Georgia State University]] &quot;many scholars claim that Pentecostalism is the fastest growing religious phenomenon in human history&quot;, and according to scholar Peter L. Berger of [[Boston University]] &quot;the spread of Pentecostal Christianity may be the fastest growing movement in the history of religion&quot;.

In 1995, David Barrett estimated there were 217 million &quot;Denominational Pentecostals&quot; throughout the world. In 2011, a [[Pew Forum]] study of global Christianity found that there were an estimated 279 million classical Pentecostals, making 4 percent of the total world population and 12.8 percent of the world&#x27;s Christian population Pentecostal. The study found &quot;Historically Pentecostal denominations&quot; (a category that did not include independent Pentecostal churches) to be the largest Protestant denominational family.

The largest percentage of Pentecostals are found in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (44 percent), followed by [[the Americas]] (37 percent) and Asia and the Pacific (16 percent). The movement is witnessing its greatest surge today in the [[global South]], which includes Africa, Central and Latin America, and most of Asia. There are 740 recognized Pentecostal denominations, but the movement also has a significant number of independent churches that are not organized into denominations.

Among the over 700 Pentecostal denominations, 240 are classified as part of [[Wesleyan]], [[Holiness Movement|Holiness]], or &quot;[[Methodist]]ic&quot; Pentecostalism. Until 1910, Pentecostalism was universally Wesleyan in doctrine, and Holiness Pentecostalism continues to predominate in the [[Southern United States]]. Wesleyan Pentecostals teach that there are three crisis experiences within a Christian&#x27;s life: conversion, sanctification, and Spirit baptism. They inherited the [[holiness movement]]&#x27;s belief in [[entire sanctification]]. According to Wesleyan Pentecostals, entire sanctification is a definite event that occurs after salvation but before Spirit baptism. This inward experience cleanses and enables the believer to live a life of [[outward holiness]]. This personal cleansing prepares the believer to receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Holiness Pentecostal denominations include the [[Apostolic Faith Church]], [[Calvary Holiness Association]], [[Congregational Holiness Church]], [[Free Gospel Church]], [[Church of God in Christ]], [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)]], and the [[International Pentecostal Holiness Church|Pentecostal Holiness Church]]. In the United States, many Holiness Pentecostal clergy are educated at the Heritage Bible College in [[Savannah, Georgia]] and the [[Free Gospel Bible Institute]] in [[Murrysville, Pennsylvania]].

After [[William Howard Durham|William H. Durham]] began preaching his [[Finished Work]] doctrine in 1910, many Pentecostals rejected the Wesleyan doctrine of entire sanctification and began to teach that there were only two definite crisis experiences in the life of a Christian: conversion and Spirit baptism. These Finished Work Pentecostals (also known as &quot;[[Baptists|Baptistic]]&quot; or &quot;Reformed&quot; Pentecostals because many converts were originally drawn from [[Baptist]] and [[Presbyterian]] backgrounds) teach that a person is initially sanctified at the moment of conversion. After conversion, the believer grows in grace through a lifelong process of progressive sanctification. There are 390 denominations that adhere to the finished work position. They include the [[Assemblies of God]], the [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel|Foursquare Gospel Church]], the [[Pentecostal Church of God]], and the [[Open Bible Churches]].

The [[1904–1905 Welsh Revival]] laid the foundation for British Pentecostalism including a distinct family of denominations known as Apostolic Pentecostalism (not to be confused with Oneness Pentecostalism). These Pentecostals are led by a hierarchy of living apostles, prophets, and other charismatic offices. Apostolic Pentecostals are found worldwide in 30 denominations, including the [[Apostolic Church (1911 denomination)|Apostolic Church]] based in the United Kingdom.

There are 80 Pentecostal denominations that are classified as Jesus&#x27; Name or [[Oneness Pentecostalism]] (often self identifying as &quot;Apostolic Pentecostals&quot;). These differ from the rest of Pentecostalism in several significant ways. Oneness Pentecostals reject the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. They do not describe God as three persons but rather as three manifestations of the one living God. Oneness Pentecostals practice [[Jesus&#x27; Name doctrine|Jesus&#x27; Name Baptism]]—water baptisms performed in the name of Jesus Christ, rather than that of the Trinity. Oneness Pentecostal adherents believe repentance, baptism in Jesus&#x27; name, and Spirit baptism are all essential elements of the conversion experience. Oneness Pentecostals hold that repentance is necessary before baptism to make the ordinance valid, and receipt of the Holy Spirit manifested by speaking in other tongues is necessary afterwards, to complete the work of baptism. This differs from other Pentecostals, along with evangelical Christians in general, who see only repentance and faith in Christ as essential to salvation. This has resulted in Oneness believers being accused by some (including other Pentecostals) of a &quot;works-salvation&quot; soteriology, a charge they vehemently deny. Oneness Pentecostals insist that salvation comes by grace through faith in Christ, coupled with obedience to his command to be &quot;born of water and of the Spirit&quot;; hence, no good works or obedience to laws or rules can save anyone. For them, baptism is not seen as a &quot;work&quot; but rather the indispensable means that Jesus himself provided to come into his kingdom. The major Oneness churches include the [[United Pentecostal Church International]] and the [[Pentecostal Assemblies of the World]].

In addition to the denominational Pentecostal churches, there are many Pentecostal churches that choose to exist independently of denominational oversight. Some of these churches may be doctrinally identical to the various Pentecostal denominations, while others may adopt beliefs and practices that differ considerably from classical Pentecostalism, such as [[Word of Faith]] teachings or [[Kingdom Now Theology|Kingdom Now theology]]. Some of these groups have been successful in utilizing the mass media, especially television and radio, to spread their message.

According to a denomination census in 2024, the [[Assemblies of God]], the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world, has 450,106 churches and 86,143,293 members worldwide. The other major international Pentecostal denominations are the [[Apostolic Church (1911 denomination)|Apostolic Church]] with 15,000,000 members, the [[Church of God (Cleveland)]] with 36,000 churches and 7,000,000 members, [[The Foursquare Church]] with 67,500 churches and 8,800,000 members, and the United Pentecostal Church International with 45,521 church and 5,800,000 members.

Among the censuses carried out by Pentecostal denominations published in 2020, those claiming the most members were on each continent:

In [[Africa]], the [[Redeemed Christian Church of God]], with 14,000 churches and 5 million members.

In [[North America]], the [[Assemblies of God USA]] with 12,986 churches and 1,810,093 members.

In [[South America]], the [[General Convention of the Assemblies of God in Brazil]] with 12,000,000 members.

In [[Asia]], the [[Indonesian Bethel Church]] with 5,000 churches and 3,000,000 members.

In [[Europe]], the [[Assemblies of God]] of France with 658 churches and 40,000 members.

In [[Oceania]], the [[Australian Christian Churches]] with 1,000 churches and 375,000 members.

==Assessment from the social sciences==

===Zora Neale Hurston===
[[Zora Neale Hurston]] performed anthropological and sociological studies examining the spread of Pentecostalism, published posthumously in a collection of essays called &quot;The Sanctified Church&quot;. According to scholar of religion Ashon Crawley, Hurston&#x27;s analysis is important because she understood the class struggle that this seemingly new religiocultural movement articulated: &quot;The Sanctified Church is a protest against the high-brow tendency in Negro Protestant congregations as the Negroes gain more education and wealth.&quot; She stated that this sect was &quot;a revitalizing element in Negro music and religion&quot; and that this collection of groups was &quot;putting back into Negro religion those elements which were brought over from Africa and grafted onto Christianity.&quot; Crawley would go on to argue that the shouting that Hurston documented was evidence of what Martinique psychoanalyst [[Frantz Fanon]] called the refusal of positionality wherein &quot;no strategic position is given preference&quot; as the creation of, the grounds for, social form.

===Rural Pentecostalism===

Pentecostalism is a religious phenomenon more visible in the cities. However, it has attracted significant rural populations in Latin America, Africa, and Eastern Europe. Sociologist David Martin has called attention on an overview on the rural Protestantism in Latin America, focusing on the indigenous and peasant conversion to Pentecostalism. The cultural change resulting from the countryside modernization has reflected on the peasant way of life. Consequently, many peasants – especially in Latin America – have experienced collective conversion to different forms of Pentecostalism and interpreted as a response to [[modernization]] in the countryside

Rather than a mere religious shift from folk Catholicism to Pentecostalism, Peasant Pentecostals have dealt with agency to employ many of their cultural resources to respond development projects in a modernization framework

Researching Guatemalan peasants and indigenous communities, Sheldon Annis argued that conversion to Pentecostalism was a way to quit the burdensome obligations of the cargo-system. Mayan folk Catholicism has many fiestas with a rotation leadership who must pay the costs and organize the yearly patron-saint festivities. One of the socially-accepted ways to opt out those obligations was to convert to Pentecostalism. By doing so, the Pentecostal Peasant engage in a &quot;[[penny capitalism]]&quot;. In the same lines of moral obligations but with different mechanism economic self-help, Paul Chandler has compared the differences between Catholic and Pentecostal peasants, and has found a web of reciprocity among Catholics [[compadrazgo|compadres]], which the Pentecostals lacked. However, Alves has found that the different Pentecostal congregations replaces the compadrazgo system and still provide channels to exercise the reciprocal obligations that the peasant moral economy demands.

Conversion to Pentecostalism provides a rupture with a socially disrupted past while allowing to maintain elements of the peasant ethos. Brazil has provided many cases to evaluate this thesis. Hoekstra has found out that rural Pentecostalism more as a continuity of the traditional past though with some ruptures. Anthropologist Brandão sees the small town and rural Pentecostalism as another face for folk religiosity instead of a path to modernization. With similar finding, Abumanssur regards Pentecostalism as an attempt to conciliate traditional worldviews of folk religion with modernity.

Identity shift has been noticed among rural converts to Pentecostalism. Indigenous and peasant communities have found in the Pentecostal religion a new identity that helps them navigate the challenges posed by modernity. This identity shift corroborates the thesis that the peasant Pentecostals pave their own ways when facing modernization.

== Controversies and criticism==
Various Christian groups have criticized the Pentecostal and charismatic movement for too much attention to [[mysticism|mystical]] manifestations, such as [[glossolalia]] (which, for a believer, would be the obligatory sign of a [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]]); along with falls to the ground, moans and cries during worship services, as well as [[anti-intellectualism]].

A particularly controversial doctrine in the Evangelical Churches is that of the [[prosperity theology]], which spread in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States, mainly through Pentecostals and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] [[televangelist]]s. This doctrine is centered on the teaching of [[Christian faith]] as a means to enrich oneself financially and materially through a &quot;positive confession&quot; and a contribution to Christian [[Minister (Christianity)|ministries]]. Promises of [[divine healing]] and [[Prosperity theology|prosperity]] are guaranteed in exchange for certain amounts of donation. Some pastors threaten those who do not [[tithe]] with curses, attacks from the devil and poverty. The collections of offerings are multiple or separated in various baskets or envelopes to stimulate the contributions of the faithful. The offerings and the tithe occupies a lot of time in some worship services. Often associated with the mandatory tithe, this doctrine is sometimes compared to a [[Business plan|religious business]]. In 2012, the National Council of Evangelicals of France published a document denouncing this doctrine, mentioning that prosperity was indeed possible for a believer, but that this theology taken to the extreme leads to materialism and to [[idolatry]], which is not the purpose of the gospel. Pentecostal pastors adhering to prosperity theology have been criticized by journalists for their lavish lifestyle (luxury clothes, big houses, [[high end]] cars, private aircraft, etc.).

In Pentecostalism, rifts accompanied the teaching of [[faith healing]]. In some churches, pricing for prayer against promises of healing has been observed. Some [[pastors]] and [[evangelism|evangelists]] have been charged with claiming false healings. Some churches have advised their members against [[vaccination]] or other [[medicine]], stating that it is for those weak in the faith and that with a positive confession, they would be immune from the disease. Pentecostal churches that discourage the use of medicine have caused preventable deaths, sometimes leading to parents being sentenced to prison for the deaths of their children. This position is not representative of most Pentecostal churches. &quot;The Miraculous Healing&quot;, published in 2015 by the , describes [[medicine]] as one of the gifts given by God to humanity. Churches and certain evangelical humanitarian organizations are also involved in medical health programs.

In Pentecostalism, health and sickness is understood holistically. They are not just physical, concurrently, psychological and spiritual, i.e. diseases and despair are from evil forces; devil, sin. Through spiritual intimacy with ultimate divinity any illness can be healed. Today&#x27;s Pentecostals accept biomedicine, but believe that divine intervention heals even where biomedicine fails. But critics argue that Pentecostal healers induce merely a placebo effect. In the anthropological view, the placebo effect mirrors that humans are a &quot;socio- psycho -physical entity&quot;, thus through symbolic manipulation i.e. strong belief on divinity, rituals and miracles, it may induce an actual healing effect on the physical level. In Pentecostalism, healing mainly is a spiritual experience. Being worthy of having an intimacy with God (i.e. ability to confess, forgiveness) gives a cathartic effect which leads to inner healing; accepting of self, healing from memories, which cleanse the root of emotional wounds and sufferings. Divine healing also addresses socially born distresses; socio gender inequalities, racial hatreds which often emerge as physical ailments by empowering patients.

Pentecostalism&#x27;s divine healing practice is frequently dismissed as emotional or illogical, yet anthropological research reveals its profound cultural and social significance. Hefner demonstrates how deeply rooted Pentecostal healing is in the social structures of countries like Indonesia. Healing techniques are not superstitious; rather, they are an expression of, and response to local power structures and social hierarchies. By functioning as tools for negotiating social roles and upholding communal ties, they show that these activities address genuine social issues and are not isolated from ordinary life.
Meyer shows how Pentecostal healing has a similar entanglement with broader cultural frameworks. Giving them a sense of empowerment dispels the notion that these activities are only a means of escape and group support. 
The focus on divine healing frequently reflects cultural perspectives on health and wellbeing, where social and spiritual dimensions are vital to comprehending and regulating health. Even while Pentecostals occasionally choose not to receive traditional medical care, this decision is influenced by a larger cultural framework that places a high importance on spiritual guidance and communal support.

Pentecostalism&#x27;s doctrine belief in faith healing has been criticized for more than just its aversion to modern medicine, their tendency to attribute mental health conditions to demonic activity has also been questioned. Faith healing has been the subject of numerous studies with a vast number of scholars aiming to either debunk or prove the effects of its use. One study however aimed rather to explore faith healing as a social construction. The study tracked the healing progress of over 100 participants. Throughout the study a significant number of participants went on to redefine their problem, such as one woman whose original problem was severe back pain; however at the conclusion of the study, she claims her troublesome relationship with her son was healed. Further the study found a correlation between those who redefine their issue and those who are more likely to claim they were healed. These findings suggest that these healings may not be a result of divine intervention. Glik stated that &quot;redefinitions may mirror therapeutic processes of self-discovery&quot; meaning these acts of faith healing may simply be the result of self-growth or the result of the restructure of one&#x27;s world view as they progress into a religious world view.

<doc id="23558" wikidata="Q1362505" url="?curid=23558" title="Pangenesis">
<text>Pangenesis was Charles Darwin&#x27;s hypothetical mechanism for heredity, in which he proposed that each part of the body continually emitted its own type of small organic particles called gemmules that aggregated in the gonads, contributing heritable information to the gametes. He presented this &#x27;provisional hypothesis&#x27; in his 1868 work &quot;The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication&quot;, intending it to fill what he perceived as a major gap in evolutionary theory at the time. The etymology of the word comes from the Greek words &quot;pan&quot; (a prefix meaning &quot;whole&quot;, &quot;encompassing&quot;) and &quot;genesis&quot; (&quot;birth&quot;) or &quot;genos&quot; (&quot;origin&quot;). Pangenesis mirrored ideas originally formulated by Hippocrates and other pre-Darwinian scientists, but using new concepts such as cell theory, explaining cell development as beginning with gemmules which were specified to be necessary for the occurrence of new growths in an organism, both in initial development and regeneration. It also accounted for regeneration and the Lamarckian concept of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, as a body part altered by the environment would produce altered gemmules. This made Pangenesis popular among the neo-Lamarckian school of evolutionary thought. This hypothesis was made effectively obsolete after the 1900 rediscovery among biologists of Gregor Mendel&#x27;s theory of the particulate nature of inheritance.

== Early history ==

Pangenesis was similar to ideas put forth by Hippocrates, Democritus and other pre-Darwinian scientists in proposing that the whole of parental organisms participate in heredity (thus the prefix &quot;pan&quot;). Darwin wrote that Hippocrates&#x27; pangenesis was &quot;almost identical with mine—merely a change of terms—and an application of them to classes of facts necessarily unknown to the old philosopher.&quot;

The historian of science Conway Zirkle wrote that:

Zirkle demonstrated that the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics had become fully accepted by the 16th century and remained immensely popular through to the time of Lamarck&#x27;s work, at which point it began to draw more criticism due to lack of hard evidence. He also stated that pangenesis was the only scientific explanation ever offered for this concept, developing from Hippocrates&#x27; belief that &quot;the semen was derived from the whole body.&quot; In the 13th century, pangenesis was commonly accepted on the principle that semen was a refined version of food unused by the body, which eventually translated to 15th and 16th century widespread use of pangenetic principles in medical literature, especially in gynecology. Later pre-Darwinian important applications of the idea included hypotheses about the origin of the differentiation of races.

A theory put forth by Pierre Louis Maupertuis in 1745 called for particles from both parents governing the attributes of the child, although some historians have called his remarks on the subject cursory and vague.

In 1749, the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon developed a hypothetical system of heredity much like Darwin&#x27;s pangenesis, wherein &#x27;organic molecules&#x27; were transferred to offspring during reproduction and stored in the body during development. Commenting on Buffon&#x27;s views, Darwin stated, &quot;If Buffon had assumed that his organic molecules had been formed by each separate unit throughout the body, his view and mine would have been very closely similar.&quot;

In 1801, Erasmus Darwin advocated a hypothesis of pangenesis in the third edition of his book &quot;Zoonomia&quot;. In 1809, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in his &quot;Philosophie Zoologique&quot; put forth evidence for the idea that characteristics acquired during the lifetime of an organism, from either environmental or behavioural effects, may be passed on to the offspring. Charles Darwin first had significant contact with Lamarckism during his time at the University of Edinburgh Medical School in the late 1820s, both through Robert Edmond Grant, whom he assisted in research, and in Erasmus&#x27;s journals. Darwin&#x27;s first known writings on the topic of Lamarckian ideas as they related to inheritance are found in a notebook he opened in 1837, also entitled &quot;Zoonomia&quot;. Historian Jonathan Hodge states that the theory of pangenesis itself first appeared in Darwin&#x27;s notebooks in 1841.

In 1861, the Irish physician Henry Freke developed a variant of pangenesis in his book &quot;Origin of Species by Means of Organic Affinity&quot;. Freke proposed that all life was developed from microscopic organic agents which he named &quot;granules&quot;, which existed as &#x27;distinct species of organizing matter&#x27; and would develop into different biological structures.

Four years before the publication of &quot;Variation&quot;, in his 1864 book &quot;Principles of Biology&quot;, Herbert Spencer proposed a theory of &quot;physiological units&quot; similar to Darwin&#x27;s gemmules, which likewise were said to be related to specific body parts and responsible for the transmission of characteristics of those body parts to offspring. He supported the Lamarckian idea of transmission of acquired characteristics.

Darwin had debated whether to publish a theory of heredity for an extended period of time due to its highly speculative nature. He decided to include pangenesis in &quot;Variation&quot; after sending a 30-page manuscript to his close friend and supporter Thomas Huxley in May 1865, which was met by significant criticism from Huxley that made Darwin even more hesitant. However, Huxley eventually advised Darwin to publish, writing: &quot;Somebody rummaging among your papers half a century hence will find Pangenesis &amp; say &#x27;See this wonderful anticipation of our modern Theories—and that stupid ass, Huxley, prevented his publishing them&#x27;&quot; Darwin&#x27;s initial version of pangenesis appeared in the first edition of &quot;Variation&quot; in 1868, and was later reworked for the publication of a second edition in 1875.

Darwin&#x27;s pangenesis theory attempted to explain the process of sexual reproduction, inheritance of traits, and complex developmental phenomena such as cellular regeneration in a unified mechanistic structure. Longshan Liu wrote that in modern terms, pangenesis deals with issues of &quot;dominance inheritance, graft hybridization, reversion, xenia, telegony, the inheritance of acquired characters, regeneration and many groups of facts pertaining to variation, inheritance and development.&quot; Mechanistically, Darwin proposed pangenesis to occur through the transfer of organic particles which he named &#x27;gemmules.&#x27; Gemmules, which he also sometimes referred to as &quot;,&quot; pangenes, granules, or germs, were supposed to be shed by the organs of the body and carried in the bloodstream to the reproductive organs where they accumulated in the germ cells or gametes. Their accumulation was thought to occur by some sort of a &#x27;mutual affinity.&#x27; Each gemmule was said to be specifically related to a certain body part- as described, they did not contain information about the entire organism. The different types were assumed to be dispersed through the whole body, and capable of self-replication given &#x27;proper nutriment&#x27;. When passed on to offspring via the reproductive process, gemmules were thought to be responsible for developing into each part of an organism and expressing characteristics inherited from both parents. Darwin thought this to occur in a literal sense: he explained cell proliferation to progress as gemmules to bind to more developed cells of their same character and mature. In this sense, the uniqueness of each individual would be due to their unique mixture of their parents&#x27; gemmules, and therefore characters. Similarity to one parent over the other could be explained by a quantitative superiority of one parent&#x27;s gemmules. Yongshen Lu points out that Darwin knew of cells&#x27; ability to multiply by self-division, so it is unclear how Darwin supposed the two proliferation mechanisms to relate to each other. He did clarify in a later statement that he had always supposed gemmules to only bind to and proliferate from developing cells, not mature ones. Darwin hypothesized that gemmules might be able to survive and multiply outside of the body in a letter to J. D. Hooker in 1870.

Some gemmules were thought to remain dormant for generations, whereas others were routinely expressed by all offspring. Every child was built up from selective expression of the mixture of the parents and grandparents&#x27; gemmules coming from either side. Darwin likened this to gardening: a flowerbed could be sprinkled with seeds &quot;most of which soon germinate, some lie for a period dormant, whilst others perish.&quot; He did not claim gemmules were in the blood, although his theory was often interpreted in this way. Responding to Fleming Jenkin&#x27;s review of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, he argued that pangenesis would permit the preservation of some favourable variations in a population so that they wouldn&#x27;t die out through blending.

Darwin thought that environmental effects that caused altered characteristics would lead to altered gemmules for the affected body part. The altered gemmules would then have a chance of being transferred to offspring, since they were assumed to be produced throughout an organism&#x27;s life. Thus, pangenesis theory allowed for the Lamarckian idea of transmission of characteristics acquired through use and disuse. Accidental gemmule development in incorrect parts of the body could explain deformations and the &#x27;monstrosities&#x27; Darwin cited in &quot;Variation&quot;.

=== De Vries ===
Hugo de Vries characterized his own version of pangenesis theory in his 1889 book &quot;Intracellular Pangenesis&quot; with two propositions, of which he only accepted the first:

:I. In the cells there are numberless particles which differ from each other, and represent the individual cells, organs, functions and qualities of the whole individual. These particles are much larger than the chemical molecules and smaller than the smallest known organisms; yet they are for the most part comparable to the latter, because, like them, they can divide and multiply through nutrition and growth. They are transmitted, during cell-division, to the daughter-cells: this is the ordinary process of heredity.
:II. In addition to this, the cells of the organism, at every stage of development, throw off such particles, which are conducted to the germ-cells and transmit to them those characters which the respective cells may have acquired during development.

=== Other variants ===

The historian of science Janet Browne points out that while Spencer and Carl von Nägeli also put forth ideas for systems of inheritance involving gemmules, their version of gemmules differed from Darwin&#x27;s in that it contained &quot;a complete microscopic blueprint for an entire creature.&quot; Spencer published his theory of &quot;physiological units&quot; three years prior to Darwin&#x27;s publication of &quot;Variation&quot;. Browne adds that Darwin believed specifically in gemmules from each body part because they might explain how environmental effects could be passed on as characteristics to offspring.

Interpretations and applications of pangenesis continued to appear frequently in medical literature up until Weismann&#x27;s experiments and subsequent publication on germ-plasm theory in 1892. For instance, an address by Huxley spurred on substantial work by Dr. James Ross in linking ideas found in Darwin&#x27;s pangenesis to the germ theory of disease. Ross cites the work of both Darwin and Spencer as key to his application of pangenetic theory.

=== Galton&#x27;s experiments on rabbits ===
Darwin&#x27;s half-cousin Francis Galton conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to refute Charles Darwin&#x27;s hypothetical theory of pangenesis. In consultation with Darwin, he set out to see if gemmules were transported in the blood. In a long series of experiments from 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring. He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.

Galton was troubled because he began the work in good faith, intending to prove Darwin right, and having praised pangenesis in &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot; in 1869. Cautiously, he criticized his cousin&#x27;s theory, although qualifying his remarks by saying that Darwin&#x27;s gemmules, which he called &quot;pangenes&quot;, might be temporary inhabitants of the blood that his experiments had failed to pick up.

Darwin challenged the validity of Galton&#x27;s experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in &quot;Nature&quot; where he wrote:

After the circulation of Galton&#x27;s results, the perception of pangenesis quickly changed to severe skepticism if not outright disbelief.

=== Weismann ===
August Weismann&#x27;s idea, set out in his 1892 book &quot;Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung&quot; (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance), was that the hereditary material, which he called the germ plasm, and the rest of the body (the soma) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. This distinction is commonly referred to as the Weismann Barrier. If correct, this made Darwin&#x27;s pangenesis wrong and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails across multiple generations, was proposed as a proof of the non-existence of Lamarckian inheritance, although Peter Gauthier has argued that Weismann&#x27;s experiment showed only that injury did not affect the germ plasm and neglected to test the effect of Lamarckian use and disuse. Weismann argued strongly and dogmatically for Darwinism and against neo-Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists. This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to its eclipse.

=== After pangenesis ===

Darwin&#x27;s pangenesis theory was widely criticised, in part for its Lamarckian premise that parents could pass on traits acquired in their lifetime. Conversely, the neo-Lamarckians of the time seized upon pangenesis as evidence to support their case. Italian Botanist Federico Delpino&#x27;s objection that gemmules&#x27; ability to self-divide is contrary to their supposedly innate nature gained considerable traction; however, Darwin was dismissive of this criticism, remarking that the particulate agents of smallpox and scarlet fever seem to have such characteristics. Lamarckism fell from favour after August Weismann&#x27;s research in the 1880s indicated that changes from use (such as lifting weights to increase muscle mass) and disuse (such as being lazy and becoming weak) were not heritable. However, some scientists continued to voice their support in spite of Galton&#x27;s and Weismann&#x27;s results: notably, in 1900 Karl Pearson wrote that pangenesis &quot;is no more disproved by the statement that &#x27;gemmules have not been found in the blood,&#x27; than the atomic theory is disproved by the fact that no atoms have been found in the air.&quot; Finally, the rediscovery of Mendel&#x27;s Laws of Inheritance in 1900 led to pangenesis being fully set aside. Julian Huxley has observed that the later discovery of chromosomes and the research of T. H. Morgan also made pangenesis untenable.

Some of Darwin&#x27;s pangenesis principles do relate to heritable aspects of phenotypic plasticity, although the status of gemmules as a distinct class of organic particles has been firmly rejected. However, starting in the 1950s, many research groups in revisiting Galton&#x27;s experiments found that heritable characteristics could indeed arise in rabbits and chickens following DNA injection or blood transfusion. This type of research originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1940s in the work of Sopikov and others, and was later corroborated by researchers in Switzerland as it was being further developed by the Soviet scientists. Notably, this work was supported in the USSR in part due to its conformation with the ideas of Trofim Lysenko, who espoused a version of neo-Lamarckism as part of Lysenkoism. Further research of this heritability of acquired characteristics developed into, in part, the modern field of epigenetics. Darwin himself had noted that &quot;the existence of free gemmules is a gratuitous assumption&quot;; by some accounts in modern interpretation, gemmules may be considered a prescient mix of DNA, RNA, proteins, prions, and other mobile elements that are heritable in a non-Mendelian manner at the molecular level. Liu points out that Darwin&#x27;s ideas about gemmules replicating outside of the body are predictive of &quot;in vitro&quot; gene replication used, for instance, in PCR.

<doc id="23560" wikidata="Q26308" url="?curid=23560" title="Proboscidea">
<text>Proboscidea (; , ) is a taxonomic order of afrotherian mammals containing one living family (Elephantidae) and several extinct families. First described by J. Illiger in 1811, it encompasses the elephants and their close relatives. Three living species of elephant are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. 

Extinct members of Proboscidea include the deinotheres, mastodons, gomphotheres and stegodonts. The family Elephantidae also contains several extinct groups, including mammoths and &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;. Proboscideans include some of the largest known land mammals, with the elephant &quot;Palaeoloxodon namadicus&quot; and mastodon &quot;&quot;Mammut&quot; borsoni&quot; suggested to have body masses surpassing , rivalling or exceeding paraceratheres (the otherwise largest known land mammals) in size. The largest extant proboscidean is the African bush elephant, with a world record of size of at the shoulder and . In addition to their enormous size, later proboscideans are distinguished by tusks and long, muscular trunks, which were less developed or absent in early proboscideans.

==Evolution==
Over 180 extinct members of Proboscidea have been described. The earliest members of Proboscidea like &quot;Eritherium&quot; are known from the Paleocene of Africa, around 60 million years ago, the earliest proboscideans were much smaller than living elephants, with &quot;Eritherium&quot; having a body mass of around . By the late Eocene, some members of Proboscidea like &quot;Barytherium&quot; had reached considerable size, with an estimated mass of around 2 tonnes, while others like &quot;Moeritherium&quot; are suggested to have been semi-aquatic.

A major event in proboscidean evolution was the collision of Afro-Arabia with Eurasia, during the Early Miocene, around 18-19 million years ago allowing proboscideans to disperse from their African homeland across Eurasia, and later, around 16-15 million years ago into North America across the Bering Land Bridge. Proboscidean groups prominent during the Miocene include the deinotheres, along with the more advanced elephantimorphs, including mammutids (mastodons), gomphotheres, amebelodontids (which includes the &quot;shovel tuskers&quot; like &quot;Platybelodon&quot;), choerolophodontids and stegodontids. Around 10 million years ago, the earliest members of the family Elephantidae emerged in Africa, having originated from gomphotheres. The Late Miocene saw major climatic changes, which resulted in the decline and extinction of many proboscidean groups such as amebelodontids and choerolophodontids. The earliest members of modern genera of Elephantidae appeared during the latest Miocene-early Pliocene around 6-5 million years ago. The elephantid genera &quot;Elephas&quot; (which includes the living Asian elephant) and &quot;Mammuthus&quot; (mammoths) migrated out of Africa during the late Pliocene, around 3.6 to 3.2 million years ago.

Over the course of the Early Pleistocene, all non-elephantid probobscideans outside of the Americas became extinct (including mammutids, gomphotheres and deinotheres), with the exception of &quot;Stegodon&quot;. Gomphotheres dispersed into South America during this era as part of the Great American interchange, and mammoths migrating into North America around 1.5 million years ago. At the end of the Early Pleistocene, around 800,000 years ago the elephantid genus &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; dispersed outside of Africa, becoming widely distributed in Eurasia. By the beginning of the Late Pleistocene, proboscideans were represented by around 23 species. Proboscideans underwent a dramatic decline during the Late Pleistocene as part of the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions, with all remaining non-elephantid proboscideans (including &quot;Stegodon&quot;, mastodons, and the American gomphotheres &quot;Cuvieronius&quot; and &quot;Notiomastodon&quot;) and &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; becoming extinct, with mammoths only surviving in relict populations on islands around the Bering Strait into the Holocene, with their latest survival being on Wrangel Island around 4,000 years ago.

The following cladogram is based on endocasts.

== Morphology ==
Over the course of their evolution, proboscideans experienced a significant increase in body size. Some members of the families Deinotheriidae, Mammutidae, Stegodontidae and Elephantidae are thought to have exceeded modern elephants in size, with shoulder heights over and masses over , with average fully grown males of the mammutid &quot;&quot;Mammut&quot; borsoni&quot; having an estimated body mass of , making it one the largest and perhaps the largest land mammal ever, with a fragmentary specimen of the Indian elephant species &quot;Palaeoloxodon namadicus&quot; only known from a partial femur being speculatively estimated in the same study to have possibly reached a body mass of . As with other megaherbivores, including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs, the large size of proboscideans likely developed to allow them to survive on vegetation with low nutritional value. Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader. The feet were originally plantigrade and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pads and the sesamoid bone providing support, with this change developing around the common ancestor of Deinotheriidae and Elephantiformes. Members of Elephantiformes and Deinotheriidae have retracted nasal regions of the skull indicating the development of a trunk. 

The skull grew larger, especially the cranium, while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull. The increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach. The number of premolars, incisors and canines decreased. The cheek teeth (molars and premolars) became larger and more specialised. In Elephantiformes, the second upper incisor and lower incisor were transformed into ever growing tusks on the upper and lower jaws, while in Deinotheriidae there are only tusks on the lower jaw. The tusks are proportionally heavy for their size, being primarily composed of dentine. In primitive proboscideans, a band of enamel covers part of the tusk surface, though in many later groups including modern elephants the band is lost, with elephants only having enamel on the tusk tips of juveniles. The upper tusks were initially modest in size, but from the Late Miocene onwards proboscideans developed increasingly large tusks, with the longest ever recorded tusk being long belonging to the mammutid &quot;&quot;Mammut&quot; borsoni&quot; found in Greece, with some mammoth tusks likely weighing over . The lower tusks are generally smaller than the upper tusks, but could grow to large sizes in some species, like in &quot;Deinotherium&quot; (which lacks upper tusks), where they could grow over long, the amebelodontid &quot;Konobelodon&quot; has lower tusks long, with the longest lower tusks ever recorded being from the primitive elephantid &quot;Stegotetrabelodon&quot; which are around long. 

The molar teeth changed from being replaced vertically as in other mammals to being replaced horizontally in the clade Elephantimorpha. While early Elephantimorpha generally had lower jaws with an elongated mandibular symphysis at the front of the jaw with well developed lower tusks/incisors, from the Late Miocene onwards, many groups convergently developed brevirostrine (shortened) lower jaws with vestigial or no lower tusks. Elephantids are distinguished from other proboscideans by a major shift in the molar morphology to parallel lophs rather than the cusps of earlier proboscideans, allowing them to become higher crowned (hypsodont) and more efficient in consuming grass. 

=== Dwarfism ===
Several species of proboscideans lived on islands and experienced insular dwarfism. This occurred primarily during the Pleistocene, when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels, although dwarf elephants did exist earlier in the Pliocene. These elephants likely grew smaller on islands due to a lack of large or viable predator populations and limited resources. By contrast, small mammals such as rodents develop gigantism in these conditions. Dwarf proboscideans are known to have lived in Indonesia, the Channel Islands of California, and several islands of the Mediterranean.

&quot;Elephas celebensis&quot; of Sulawesi is believed to have descended from &quot;Elephas planifrons&quot;. &quot;Elephas falconeri&quot; of Malta and Sicily was only , and had probably evolved from the straight-tusked elephant. Other descendants of the straight-tusked elephant existed in Cyprus. Dwarf elephants of uncertain descent lived in Crete, Cyclades and Dodecanese, while dwarf mammoths are known to have lived in Sardinia. The Columbian mammoth colonised the Channel Islands and evolved into the pygmy mammoth. This species reached a height of and weighed . A population of small woolly mammoths survived on Wrangel Island as recently as 4,000 years ago. After their discovery in 1993, they were considered dwarf mammoths. This classification has been re-evaluated and since the Second International Mammoth Conference in 1999, these animals are no longer considered to be true &quot;dwarf mammoths&quot;.

== Ecology ==
It has been suggested that members of Elephantimorpha, including mammutids, gomphotheres, and stegodontids, lived in herds like modern elephants. Analysis of remains of the American mastodon (&quot;Mammut americanum&quot;) suggest that like modern elephants, that herds consisted of females and juveniles and that adult males lived solitarily or in small groups, and that adult males periodically engaged in fights with other males during periods similar to musth found in living elephants. These traits are suggested to be inherited from the last common ancestor of elephantimorphs, with musth-like behaviour also suggested to have occurred in gomphotheres. All elephantimorphs are suggested to have been capable of communication via infrasound, as found in living elephants. Deinotheres may have also lived in herds, based on tracks found in the Late Miocene of Romania. Over the course of the Neogene and Pleistocene, various members of Elephantida shifted from a browse-dominated diet towards mixed feeding or grazing.

<text>Paranthropus is a genus of extinct hominin which contains two widely accepted species: &quot;P. robustus&quot; and &quot;P. boisei&quot;. However, the validity of &quot;Paranthropus&quot; is contested, and it is sometimes considered to be synonymous with &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. They are also referred to as the robust australopithecines. They lived between approximately 2.9 and 1.2 million years ago (mya) from the end of the Pliocene to the Middle Pleistocene.

&quot;Paranthropus&quot; is characterised by robust skulls, with a prominent gorilla-like sagittal crest along the midline—which suggest strong chewing muscles—and broad, herbivorous teeth used for grinding. However, they likely preferred soft food over tough and hard food. Typically, &quot;Paranthropus&quot; species were generalist feeders, but while &quot;P. robustus&quot; was likely an omnivore, &quot;P. boisei&quot; seems to have been herbivorous, possibly preferring abundant bulbotubers. Paranthropoids were bipeds. Despite their robust heads, they had comparatively small bodies. Average weight and height are estimated to be at for &quot;P. robustus&quot; males, at for &quot;P. boisei&quot; males, at for &quot;P. robustus&quot; females, and at for &quot;P. boisei&quot; females.

They were possibly polygamous and patrilocal, but there are no modern analogues for australopithecine societies. They are associated with bone tools and contested as the earliest evidence of fire usage. They typically inhabited woodlands, and coexisted with some early human species, namely &quot;A. africanus&quot;, &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. erectus&quot;. They were preyed upon by the large carnivores of the time, specifically crocodiles, leopards, sabertoothed cats and hyenas.

==Taxonomy==
===Species===
====&quot;P. robustus&quot;====
The genus &quot;Paranthropus&quot; was first erected by Scottish-South African palaeontologist Robert Broom in 1938, with the type species &quot;P. robustus&quot;. &quot;Paranthropus&quot; derives from Ancient Greek παρα &quot;para&quot; beside or alongside; and άνθρωπος &quot;ánthropos&quot; man. The type specimen, a male braincase, TM 1517, was discovered by schoolboy Gert Terblanche at the Kromdraai fossil site, about southwest of Pretoria, South Africa. By 1988, at least six individuals were unearthed in around the same area, now known as the Cradle of Humankind.

In 1948, at Swartkrans Cave, in about the same vicinity as Kromdraai, Broom and South African palaeontologist John Talbot Robinson described &quot;P. crassidens&quot; based on a subadult jaw, SK 6. He believed later &quot;Paranthropus&quot; were morphologically distinct from earlier &quot;Paranthropus&quot; in the cave—that is, the Swartkrans &quot;Paranthropus&quot; were reproductively isolated from Kromdraai &quot;Paranthropus&quot; and the former eventually speciated. By 1988, several specimens from Swartkrans had been placed into &quot;P. crassidens&quot;. However, this has since been synonymised with &quot;P. robustus&quot; as the two populations do not seem to be very distinct.

====&quot;P. boisei&quot;====
In 1959, &quot;P. boisei&quot; was discovered by Mary Leakey at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania (specimen OH 5). Her husband Louis named it &quot;Zinjanthropus boisei&quot; because he believed it differed greatly from &quot;Paranthropus&quot; and &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. The name derives from &quot;Zinj&quot;, an ancient Arabic word for the coast of East Africa, and &quot;boisei&quot;, referring to their financial benefactor Charles Watson Boise. However, this genus was rejected at Mr. Leakey&#x27;s presentation before the 4th Pan-African Congress on Prehistory, as it was based on a single specimen. The discovery of the Peninj Mandible made the Leakeys reclassify their species as &quot;Australopithecus (Zinjanthropus) boisei&quot; in 1964, but in 1967, South African palaeoanthropologist Phillip V. Tobias subsumed it into &quot;Australopithecus&quot; as &quot;A. boisei&quot;. However, as more specimens were found, the combination &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot; became more popular.

It is debated whether the wide range of variation in jaw size indicates simply sexual dimorphism or a grounds for identifying a new species. It could be explained as groundmass filling in cracks naturally formed after death, inflating the perceived size of the bone. &quot;P. boisei&quot; also has a notably wide range of variation in skull anatomy, but these features likely have no taxonomic bearing.

====&quot;P. aethiopicus&quot;====

In 1968, French palaeontologists Camille Arambourg and Yves Coppens described &quot;Paraustralopithecus aethiopicus&quot; based on a toothless mandible from the Shungura Formation, Ethiopia (Omo 18). In 1976, American anthropologist Francis Clark Howell and Breton anthropologist Yves Coppens reclassified it as &quot;A. africanus&quot;. In 1986, after the discovery of the skull KNM WT 17000 by English anthropologist Alan Walker and Richard Leakey classified it into &quot;Paranthropus&quot; as &quot;P. aethiopicus&quot;. There is debate whether this is synonymous with &quot;P. boisei&quot;, the main argument for separation being the skull seems less adapted for chewing tough vegetation.

In 1989, palaeoartist and zoologist Walter Ferguson reclassified KNM WT 17000 into a new species, &quot;walkeri&quot;, because he considered the skull&#x27;s species designation questionable as it comprised the skull whereas the holotype of &quot;P. aethiopicus&quot; comprised only the mandible. Ferguson&#x27;s classification is almost universally ignored, and is considered to be synonymous with &quot;P. aethiopicus&quot;.

====Others====

In 2015, Ethiopian palaeoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie and colleagues described the 3.5–3.2 Ma &quot;A. deyiremeda&quot; based on three jawbones from the Afar Region, Ethiopia. They noted that, though it shares many similarities with &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, it may not have been closely related because it lacked enlarged molars which characterize the genus. Nonetheless, in 2018, independent researcher Johan Nygren recommended moving it to &quot;Paranthropus&quot; based on dental and presumed dietary similarity.

===Validity===
In 1951, American anthropologists Sherwood Washburn and Bruce D. Patterson were the first to suggest that &quot;Paranthropus&quot; should be considered a junior synonym of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; as the former was only known from fragmentary remains at the time, and dental differences were too minute to serve as justification. In face of calls for subsumation, Leakey and Robinson continued defending its validity. Various other authors were still unsure until more complete remains were found. &quot;Paranthropus&quot; is sometimes classified as a subgenus of &quot;Australopithecus&quot;.
There is currently no clear consensus on the validity of &quot;Paranthropus&quot;. The argument rests upon whether the genus is monophyletic—is composed of a common ancestor and all of its descendants—and the argument against monophyly (that the genus is paraphyletic) says that &quot;P. robustus&quot; and &quot;P. boisei&quot; evolved similar gorilla-like heads independently of each other by coincidence (convergent evolution), as chewing adaptations in hominins evolve very rapidly and multiple times at various points in the family tree (homoplasy). In 1999, a chimp-like ulna forearm bone was assigned to &quot;P. boisei&quot;, the first discovered ulna of the species, which was markedly different from &quot;P. robustus&quot; ulnae, which could suggest paraphyly.

===Evolution===
&quot;P. aethiopicus&quot; is the earliest member of the genus, with the oldest remains, from the Ethiopian Omo Kibish Formation, dated to 2.6 mya at the end of the Pliocene. It is sometimes regarded as the direct ancestor of &quot;P. boisei&quot; and &quot;P. robustus&quot;. It is possible that &quot;P. aethiopicus&quot; evolved even earlier, up to 3.3 mya, on the expansive Kenyan floodplains of the time. The oldest &quot;P. boisei&quot; remains date to about 2.3 mya from Malema, Malawi. &quot;P. boisei&quot; changed remarkably little over its nearly one-million-year existence. &quot;Paranthropus&quot; had spread into South Africa by 2 mya with the earliest &quot;P. robustus&quot; remains.

It is sometimes suggested that &quot;Paranthropus&quot; and &quot;Homo&quot; are sister taxa, both evolving from &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. This may have occurred during a drying trend 2.8–2.5 mya in the Great Rift Valley, which caused the retreat of woodland environments in favor of open savanna, with forests growing only along rivers and lakes. &quot;Homo&quot; evolved in the former, and &quot;Paranthropus&quot; in the latter riparian environment. However, the classifications of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; species is problematic.
Evolutionary tree according to a 2019 study:
==Description==

===Skull===
&quot;Paranthropus&quot; had a massively built, tall and flat skull, with a prominent gorilla-like sagittal crest along the midline which anchored large temporalis muscles used in chewing. Like other australopithecines, &quot;Paranthropus&quot; exhibited sexual dimorphism, with males notably larger than females. They had large molars with a relatively thick tooth enamel coating (post-canine megadontia), and comparatively small incisors (similar in size to modern humans), possibly adaptations to processing abrasive foods. The teeth of &quot;P. aethiopicus&quot; developed faster than those of &quot;P. boisei&quot;.

&quot;Paranthropus&quot; had adaptations to the skull to resist large bite loads while feeding, namely the expansive squamosal sutures. The notably thick palate was once thought to have been an adaptation to resist a high bite force, but is better explained as a byproduct of facial lengthening and nasal anatomy.

In &quot;P. boisei&quot;, the jaw hinge was adapted to grinding food side-to-side (rather than up-and-down in modern humans), which is better at processing the starchy abrasive foods that likely made up the bulk of its diet. &quot;P. robustus&quot; may have chewed in a front-to-back direction instead, and had less exaggerated (less derived) anatomical features than &quot;P. boisei&quot; as it perhaps did not require them with this kind of chewing strategy. This may have also allowed &quot;P. robustus&quot; to better process tougher foods.

The braincase volume averaged about , comparable to gracile australopithecines, but smaller than &quot;Homo&quot;. Modern human brain volume averages for men and for women.

===Limbs and locomotion===
Unlike &quot;P. robustus&quot;, the forearms of &quot;P. boisei&quot; were heavily built, which might suggest habitual suspensory behaviour as in orangutans and gibbons. A &quot;P. boisei&quot; shoulder blade indicates long infraspinatus muscles, which is also associated with suspensory behavior. A &quot;P. aethiopicus&quot; ulna, on the other hand, shows more similarities to &quot;Homo&quot; than &quot;P. boisei&quot;.

&quot;Paranthropus&quot; were bipeds, and their hips, legs and feet resemble &quot;A. afarensis&quot; and modern humans. The pelvis is similar to &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, but the hip joints are smaller in &quot;P. robustus&quot;. The physical similarity implies a similar walking gait. Their modern-humanlike big toe indicates a modern-humanlike foot posture and range of motion, but the more distal ankle joint would have inhibited the modern human toe-off gait cycle. By 1.8 mya, &quot;Paranthropus&quot; and &quot;H. habilis&quot; may have achieved about the same grade of bipedality.

===Height and weight===
In comparison to the large, robust head, the body was rather small. Average weight for &quot;P. robustus&quot; may have been for males and for females; and for &quot;P. boisei&quot; for males and for females. At Swartkrans Cave Members 1 and 2, about 35% of the &quot;P. robustus&quot; individuals are estimated to have weighed , 22% about , and the remaining 43% bigger than the former but less than . At Member 3, all individuals were about . Female weight was about the same in contemporaneous &quot;H. erectus&quot;, but male &quot;H. erectus&quot; were on average heavier than &quot;P. robustus&quot; males. &quot;P. robustus&quot; sites are oddly dominated by small adults, which could be explained as heightened predation or mortality of the larger males of a group. The largest-known &quot;Paranthropus&quot; individual was estimated at .

According to a 1991 study, based on femur length and using the dimensions of modern humans, male and female &quot;P. robustus&quot; are estimated to have stood on average , respectively, and &quot;P. boisei&quot; . However, the latter estimates are problematic as there were no positively identified male &quot;P. boisei&quot; femurs at the time. In 2013, a 1.34 Ma male &quot;P. boisei&quot; partial skeleton was estimated to be at least and .

===Pathology===
&quot;Paranthropus&quot; seems to have had notably high rates of pitting enamel hypoplasia (PEH), where tooth enamel formation is spotty instead of mostly uniform. In &quot;P. robustus&quot;, about 47% of baby teeth and 14% of adult teeth were affected, in comparison to about 6.7% and 4.3%, respectively, in any other tested hominin species. The condition of these holes covering the entire tooth is consistent with the modern human ailment amelogenesis imperfecta. However, since circular holes in enamel coverage are uniform in size, only present on the molar teeth, and have the same severity across individuals, the PEH may have been a genetic condition. It is possible that the coding-DNA concerned with thickening enamel also left them more vulnerable to PEH.

There have been 10 identified cases of cavities in &quot;P. robustus&quot;, indicating a rate similar to modern humans. A molar from Drimolen, South Africa, showed a cavity on the tooth root, a rare occurrence in fossil great apes. In order for cavity-creating bacteria to reach this area, the individual would have had to have also presented either alveolar resportion, which is commonly associated with gum disease; or super-eruption of teeth which occurs when teeth become worn down and have to erupt a bit more in order to maintain a proper bite, and this exposed the root. The latter is most likely, and the exposed root seems to have caused hypercementosis to anchor the tooth in place. The cavity seems to have been healing, which may have been caused by a change in diet or mouth microbiome, or the loss of the adjacent molar.

==Palaeobiology==
===Diet===

It was once thought &quot;P. boisei&quot; cracked open nuts with its powerful teeth, giving OH 5 the nickname &quot;Nutcracker Man&quot;. However, like gorillas, &quot;Paranthropus&quot; likely preferred soft foods, but would consume tough or hard food during leaner times, and the powerful jaws were used only in the latter situation. In &quot;P. boisei&quot;, thick enamel was more likely used to resist abrasive gritty particles rather than to minimize chipping while eating hard foods. In fact, there is a distinct lack of tooth fractures which would have resulted from such activity.

&quot;Paranthropus&quot; were generalist feeders, but diet seems to have ranged dramatically with location. The South African &quot;P. robustus&quot; appears to have been an omnivore, with a diet similar to contemporaneous &quot;Homo&quot; and nearly identical to the later &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, and subsisted on mainly C4 savanna plants and C3 forest plants, which could indicate either seasonal shifts in diet or seasonal migration from forest to savanna. In leaner times it may have fallen back on brittle food. It likely also consumed seeds and possibly tubers or termites. A high cavity rate could indicate honey consumption.

The East African &quot;P. boisei&quot;, on the other hand, seems to have been largely herbivorous and fed on C4 plants. Its powerful jaws allowed it to consume a wide variety of different plants, though it may have largely preferred nutrient-rich bulbotubers as these are known to thrive in the well-watered woodlands it is thought to have inhabited. Feeding on these, &quot;P. boisei&quot; may have been able to meet its daily caloric requirements of approximately 9,700 kJ after about 6 hours of foraging.

Juvenile &quot;P. robustus&quot; may have relied more on tubers than adults, given the elevated levels of strontium compared to adults in teeth from Swartkrans Cave, which, in the area, was most likely sourced from tubers. Dentin exposure on juvenile teeth could indicate early weaning, or a more abrasive diet than adults which wore away the cementum and enamel coatings, or both. It is also possible juveniles were less capable of removing grit from dug-up food rather than purposefully seeking out more abrasive foods.

===Technology===
Oldowan toolkits were uncovered at an excavation site on the Homa Peninsula in western Kenya. Stone tools called &quot;oldowan toolkits&quot; are used to pound and shape other rocks or plant materials. These tools are thought to be between 2.6 and 3 million years old. The stone tools were found near Paranthropus teeth.

Bone tools dating between 2.3 and 0.6 mya have been found in abundance in Swartkrans, Kromdraai and Drimolen caves, and are often associated with &quot;P. robustus&quot;. Though &quot;Homo&quot; is also known from these caves, their remains are comparatively scarce to &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, making &quot;Homo&quot;-attribution unlikely. The tools also cooccur with &quot;Homo&quot;-associated Oldawan and possibly Acheulian stone tool industries. The bone tools were typically sourced from the shaft of long bones from medium- to large-sized mammals, but tools made sourced from mandibles, ribs and horn cores have also been found. Bone tools have also been found at Oldawan Gorge and directly associated with &quot;P. boisei&quot;, the youngest dating to 1.34 mya, though a great proportion of other bone tools from here have ambiguous attribution. Stone tools from Kromdraai could possibly be attributed to &quot;P. robustus&quot;, as no &quot;Homo&quot; have been found there yet.

The bone tools were not manufactured or purposefully shaped for a task. However, since the bones display no weathering (and were not scavenged randomly), and there is a preference displayed for certain bones, raw materials were likely specifically hand-picked. This could indicate a similar cognitive ability to contemporary Stone Age &quot;Homo&quot;.

Bone tools may have been used to cut or process vegetation, or dig up tubers or termites, The form of &quot;P. robustus&quot; incisors appear to be intermediate between &quot;H. erectus&quot; and modern humans, which could indicate less food processing done by the teeth due to preparation with simple tools.

Burnt bones were also associated with the inhabitants of Swartkrans, which could indicate some of the earliest fire usage. However, these bones were found in Member 3, where &quot;Paranthropus&quot; remains are rarer than &quot;H. erectus&quot;, and it is also possible the bones were burned in a wildfire and washed into the cave as it is known the bones were not burned onsite.

===Social structure===

Given the marked anatomical and physical differences with modern great apes, there may be no modern analogue for australopithecine societies, so comparisons drawn with modern primates will not be entirely accurate.

&quot;Paranthropus&quot; had pronounced sexual dimorphism, with males notably larger than females, which is commonly correlated with a male-dominated polygamous society. &quot;P. robustus&quot; may have had a harem society similar to modern forest-dwelling silverback gorillas, where one male has exclusive breeding rights to a group of females, as male-female size disparity is comparable to gorillas (based on facial dimensions), and younger males were less robust than older males (delayed maturity is also exhibited in gorillas).

However, if &quot;P. robustus&quot; preferred a savanna habitat, a multi-male society would have been more productive to better defend the troop from predators in the more exposed environment, much like savanna baboons. Further, among primates, delayed maturity is also exhibited in the rhesus monkey which has a multi-male society, and may not be an accurate indicator of social structure.

A 2011 strontium isotope study of &quot;P. robustus&quot; teeth from the dolomite Sterkfontein Valley found that, like other hominins, but unlike other great apes, &quot;P. robustus&quot; females were more likely to leave their place of birth (patrilocal). This also discounts the plausibility of a harem society, which would have resulted in a matrilocal society due to heightened male–male competition. Males did not seem to have ventured very far from the valley, which could either indicate small home ranges, or that they preferred dolomitic landscapes due to perhaps cave abundance or factors related to vegetation growth.

===Life history===
Dental development seems to have followed about the same timeframe as it does in modern humans and most other hominins, but, since &quot;Paranthropus&quot; molars are markedly larger, rate of tooth eruption would have been accelerated. Their life history may have mirrored that of gorillas as they have the same brain volume, which (depending on the subspecies) reach physical maturity from 12–18 years and have birthing intervals of 40–70 months.

==Palaeoecology==
===Habitat===

It is generally thought that &quot;Paranthropus&quot; preferred to inhabit wooded, riverine landscapes. The teeth of &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. erectus&quot; are all known from various overlapping beds in East Africa, such as at Olduvai Gorge and the Turkana Basin. &quot;P. robustus&quot; and &quot;H. erectus&quot; also appear to have coexisted.

&quot;P. boisei&quot;, known from the Great Rift Valley, may have typically inhabited wetlands along lakes and rivers, wooded or arid shrublands, and semiarid woodlands, though their presence in the savanna-dominated Malawian Chiwondo Beds implies they could tolerate a range of habitats. During the Pleistocene, there seem to have been coastal and montane forests in Eastern Africa. More expansive river valleys—namely the Omo River Valley—may have served as important refuges for forest-dwelling creatures. Being cut off from the forests of Central Africa by a savanna corridor, these East African forests would have promoted high rates of endemism, especially during times of climatic volatility.

The Cradle of Humankind, the only area &quot;P. robustus&quot; is known from, was mainly dominated by the springbok &quot;Antidorcas recki&quot;, but other antelope, giraffes and elephants were also seemingly abundant megafauna. Other known primates are early &quot;Homo&quot;, the hamadryas baboon, and the extinct colobine monkey &quot;Cercopithecoides williamsi&quot;.

===Predators===

The left foot of a &quot;P. boisei&quot; specimen (though perhaps actually belonging to &quot;H. habilis&quot;) from Olduvai Gorge seems to have been bitten off by a crocodile, possibly &quot;Crocodylus anthropophagus&quot;, and another&#x27;s leg shows evidence of leopard predation. Other likely Olduvan predators of great apes include the hunting hyena &quot;Chasmaporthetes nitidula&quot;, and the sabertoothed cats &quot;Dinofelis&quot; and &quot;Megantereon&quot;. The carnivore assemblage at the Cradle of Humankind comprises the two sabertooths, and the hyena &quot;Lycyaenops silberbergi&quot;.

Male &quot;P. robustus&quot; appear to have had a higher mortality rate than females. It is possible that males were more likely to be kicked out of a group, and these lone males had a higher risk of predation.

===Extinction===
It was once thought that &quot;Paranthropus&quot; had become a specialist feeder, and were inferior to the more adaptable tool-producing &quot;Homo&quot;, leading to their extinction, but this has been called into question. However, smaller brain size may have been a factor in their extinction along with gracile australopithecines. &quot;P. boisei&quot; may have died out due to an arid trend starting 1.45 mya, causing the retreat of woodlands, and more competition with savanna baboons and &quot;Homo&quot; for alternative food resources.

South African &quot;Paranthropus&quot; appear to have outlasted their East African counterparts. The youngest record of &quot;P. boisei&quot; comes from Konso, Ethiopia about 1.4 mya; however, there are no East African sites dated between 1.4 and 1 mya, so it may have persisted until 1 mya. &quot;P. robustus&quot;, on the other hand, was recorded in Swartkrans until Member 3 dated to 1–0.6 mya (the Middle Pleistocene), though more likely the younger side of the estimate.

<doc id="23562" wikidata="Q25374" url="?curid=23562" title="Perissodactyla">
<text>Perissodactyla (, ), or odd-toed ungulates, is an order of ungulates. The order includes about 17 living species divided into three families: Equidae (horses, asses, and zebras), Rhinocerotidae (rhinoceroses), and Tapiridae (tapirs). They typically have reduced the weight-bearing toes to three or one of the five original toes, though tapirs retain four toes on their front feet. The nonweight-bearing toes are either present, absent, vestigial, or positioned posteriorly. By contrast, artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates) bear most of their weight equally on four or two (an even number) of the five toes: their third and fourth toes. Another difference between the two is that perissodactyls digest plant cellulose in their intestines, rather than in one or more stomach chambers as artiodactyls, with the exception of Suina, do.

The order was considerably more diverse in the past, with notable extinct groups including the brontotheres, palaeotheres, chalicotheres, and the paraceratheres, with the paraceratheres including the largest known land mammals to have ever existed.

Despite their very different appearances, they were recognized as related families in the 19th century by the zoologist Richard Owen, who also coined the order&#x27;s name.

==Anatomy==
The largest odd-toed ungulates are rhinoceroses, and the extinct &quot;Paraceratherium&quot;, a hornless rhino from the Oligocene, is considered one of the largest land mammals of all time. At the other extreme, an early member of the order, the prehistoric horse &quot;Eohippus&quot;, had a withers height of only . Apart from dwarf varieties of the domestic horse and donkey, living perissodactyls reach a body length of and a weight of . While rhinos have only sparse hair and exhibit a thick epidermis, tapirs and horses have dense, short coats. Most species are grey or brown, although zebras and young tapirs are striped.

===Limbs===

The main axes of both the front and rear feet pass through the third toe, which is always the largest. The remaining toes have been reduced in size to varying degrees. Tapirs, which are adapted to walking on soft ground, have four toes on their fore feet and three on their hind feet. Living rhinos have three toes on both the front and hind feet. Modern equines possess only a single toe; however, their feet are equipped with hooves, which almost completely cover the toe. Rhinos and tapirs, by contrast, have hooves covering only the leading edge of the toes, with the bottom being soft.

Ungulates have stances that require them to stand on the tips of their toes. Equine ungulates with only one digit or hoof have decreased mobility in their limbs, which allows for faster running speeds and agility.
Differences in limb structure and physiology between ungulates and other mammals can be seen in the shape of the humerus. For example, often shorter, thicker, bones belong to the largest and heaviest ungulates like the rhinoceros.

The ulnae and fibulae are reduced in horses. A common feature that clearly distinguishes this group from other mammals is the articulation between the astragalus, the scaphoid and the cuboid, which greatly restricts the mobility of the foot. The thigh is relatively short, and the clavicle is absent.

===Skull and teeth===
Odd-toed ungulates have a long upper jaw with an extended diastema between the front and cheek teeth, giving them an elongated head. The various forms of snout between families are due to differences in the form of the premaxilla. The lacrimal bone has projecting cusps in the eye sockets and a wide contact with the nasal bone. The temporomandibular joint is high and the mandible is enlarged.

Rhinos have one or two horns made of keratin, unlike the horns of even-toed ungulates (Bovidae and pronghorn), which have a bony core.

The number and form of the teeth vary according to diet. The incisors and canines can be very small or completely absent, as in the two African species of rhinoceros. In horses, usually only the males possess canines. The surface shape and height of the molars is heavily dependent on whether soft leaves or hard grass make up the main component of their diets. Three or four cheek teeth are present on each jaw half, so the dental formula of odd-toed ungulates is: 
The guttural pouch, a small outpocketing of the auditory tube that drains the middle ear, is a characteristic feature of Perissodactyla. The guttural pouch is of particular concern in equine veterinary practice, due to its frequent involvement in some serious infections. Aspergillosis (infection with &quot;Aspergillus&quot; mould) of the guttural pouch (also called guttural pouch mycosis) can cause serious damage to the tissues of the pouch, as well as surrounding structures including important cranial nerves (nerves IX-XII: glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory and hypoglossal nerves) and the internal carotid artery. Strangles (&quot;Streptococcus equi equi&quot; infection) is a highly transmissible respiratory infection of horses that can cause pus to accumulate in the guttural pouch; horses with &quot;S. equi equi&quot; colonising their guttural pouch can continue to intermittently shed the bacteria for several months, and should be isolated from other horses during this time to prevent transmission. Due to the intermittent nature of &quot;S. equi equi&quot; shedding, prematurely reintroducing an infected horse may risk exposing other horses to the infection, even though the shedding horse appears well and may have previously returned negative samples. The function of the guttural pouch has been difficult to determine, but it is now believed to play a role in cooling blood in the internal carotid artery before it enters the brain.

===Gut===
All perissodactyls are hindgut fermenters. In contrast to ruminants, hindgut fermenters store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where the food begins digestion by microbes, with the fermentation continuing in the large colon. No gallbladder is present. The stomach of perissodactyls is simply built, while the cecum accommodates up to in horses. The small intestine is very long, reaching up to in horses. Extraction of nutrients from food is relatively inefficient, which probably explains why no odd-toed ungulates are small; nutritional requirements per unit of body weight are lower for large animals, as their surface-area-to-volume ratio is smaller.

=== Lack of carotid rete ===
Unlike artiodactyls, perissodactyls lack a carotid rete, a heat exchange that reduces the dependence of the temperature of the brain on that of the body. As a result, perissodactyls have limited thermoregulatory flexibility compared to artiodactyls which has restricted them to habitats of low seasonality and rich in food and water, such as tropical forests. In contrast, artiodactyls occupy a wide range of habits ranging from the Arctic Circle to deserts and tropical savannahs.

==Distribution==

Most extant perissodactyl species occupy a small fraction of their original range. Members of this group are now found only in Central and South America, eastern and southern Africa, and central, southern, and southeastern Asia. During the peak of odd-toed ungulate existence, from the Eocene to the Oligocene, perissodactyls were distributed over much of the globe, the major exceptions being Australia and Antarctica. Horses and tapirs arrived in South America after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama around 3 million years ago in the Pliocene. Their North American counterparts died out around 10,000 years ago, leaving only Baird&#x27;s tapir with a range extending to what is now southern Mexico. The tarpans were pushed to extinction in 19th century Europe. Hunting and habitat destruction have reduced the surviving perissodactyl species to fragmented populations. In contrast, domesticated horses and donkeys have gained a worldwide distribution, and feral animals of both species are now also found in regions outside their original range, such as in Australia.

==Lifestyle and diet==
Perissodactyls inhabit a number of different habitats, leading to different lifestyles. Tapirs are solitary and inhabit mainly tropical rainforests. Rhinos tend to live alone in rather dry savannas, and in Asia, wet marsh or forest areas. Horses inhabit open areas such as grasslands, steppes, or semi-deserts, and live together in groups. Odd-toed ungulates are exclusively herbivores that feed, to varying degrees, on grass, leaves, and other plant parts. A distinction is often made between primarily grass feeders (white rhinos, equines) and leaf feeders (tapirs, other rhinos).

==Reproduction and development==

Odd-toed ungulates are characterized by a long gestation period and a small litter size, usually delivering a single young. The gestation period is 330–500 days, being longest in rhinos. Newborn perissodactyls are precocial, meaning offspring are born already quite independent: for example, young horses can begin to follow the mother after a few hours. The young are nursed for a relatively long time, often into their second year, with rhinos reaching sexual maturity around eight or ten years old, but horses and tapirs maturing around two to four years old. Perissodactyls are long-lived, with several species, such as rhinos, reaching an age of almost 50 years in captivity.

==Taxonomy==
===Outer taxonomy===
Traditionally, the odd-toed ungulates were classified with other mammals such as artiodactyls, hyraxes, elephants and other &quot;ungulates&quot;. A close family relationship with hyraxes was suspected based on similarities in the construction of the ear and the course of the carotid artery.

Molecular genetic studies, however, have shown the ungulates to be polyphyletic, meaning that in some cases the similarities are the result of convergent evolution rather than common ancestry. Elephants and hyraxes are now considered to belong to Afrotheria, so are not closely related to the perissodactyls. These in turn are in the Laurasiatheria, a superorder that had its origin in the former supercontinent Laurasia. Molecular genetic findings suggest that the cloven Artiodactyla (containing the cetaceans as a deeply nested subclade) are the sister taxon of the Perissodactyla; together, the two groups form the Euungulata. More distant are the bats (Chiroptera) and Ferae (a common taxon of carnivorans, Carnivora, and pangolins, Pholidota). In a discredited alternative scenario, a close relationship exists between perissodactyls, carnivorans, and bats, this assembly comprising the Pegasoferae.

According to studies published in March 2015, odd-toed ungulates are in a close family relationship with at least some of the so-called Meridiungulata, a very diverse group of mammals living from the Paleocene to the Pleistocene in South America, whose systematic unity is largely unexplained. Some of these were classified based on their paleogeographic distribution. However, a close relationship can be worked out to perissodactyls by protein sequencing and comparison with fossil collagen from remnants of phylogenetically young members of the Meridiungulata (specifically &quot;Macrauchenia&quot; from the Litopterna and &quot;Toxodon&quot; from the Notoungulata). Both kinship groups, the odd-toed ungulates and the Litopterna-Notoungulata, are now in the higher-level taxon of Panperissodactyla. This kinship group is included among the Euungulata, which also contains the even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). The separation of the Litopterna-Notoungulata group from the perissodactyls probably took place before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. &quot;Condylarths&quot; can probably be considered the starting point for the development of the two groups, as they represent a heterogeneous group of primitive ungulates that mainly inhabited the northern hemisphere in the Paleogene.

===Modern members===
Odd-toed ungulates comprise three living families with around 17 species—in horses, however, the exact count is still controversial. Rhinos and tapirs are more closely related to each other than to horses. The separation of horses from other perissodactyls took place according to molecular genetic analysis in the Paleocene some 56 million years ago, while the rhinos and tapirs split off in the lower-middle Eocene, about 47 million years ago.

===Prehistoric members===
There are many perissodactyl fossils of multivariant form. The major lines of development include the following groups:

*Brontotherioidea were among the earliest known large mammals, consisting of the families of Brontotheriidae (synonym Titanotheriidae), the most well-known representative being &quot;Megacerops&quot; and the more basal family Lambdotheriidae. They were generally characterized in their late phase by a bony horn at the transition from the nose to the frontal bone and flat molars suitable for chewing soft plant food. The Brontotheroidea, which were almost exclusively confined to North America and Asia, died out at the beginning of the Upper Eocene.
*Equoidea also developed in the Eocene. Palaeotheriidae are known mainly from Europe. In contrast, the horse family (Equidae) flourished and spread. Over time this group saw a reduction in toe number, extension of the limbs, and the progressive adjustment of the teeth for eating hard grasses.
*Chalicotherioidea represented another characteristic group, consisting of the families Chalicotheriidae and Lophiodontidae. The Chalicotheriidae developed claws instead of hooves and considerable extension of the forelegs. The best-known genera include &quot;Chalicotherium&quot; and &quot;Moropus&quot;. Chalicotherioidea died out in the Pleistocene.
*Rhinocerotoidea (rhino relatives) included a large variety of forms from the Eocene up to the Oligocene, including dog-size leaf feeders, semiaquatic animals, and also huge long-necked animals. Only a few had horns on the nose. The Amynodontidae were hippo-like, aquatic animals. Hyracodontidae developed long limbs and long necks that were most pronounced in the &quot;Paraceratherium&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Baluchitherium&quot; or &quot;Indricotherium&quot;), the second largest known land mammal ever to have lived (after &quot;Palaeoloxodon namadicus&quot;). The rhinos (Rhinocerotidae) emerged in the Middle Eocene; five species survive to the present day.
*Tapiroidea reached their greatest diversity in the Eocene, when several families lived in Eurasia and North America. They retained a primitive physique and were noted for developing a trunk. The extinct families within this group include the Helaletidae.
*Several mammal groups traditionally classified as condylarths, long-understood to be a wastebasket taxon, such as hyopsodontids and phenacodontids, are now understood to be part of the odd-toed ungulate assemblage. Phenacodontids seem to be stem-perissodactyls, while hyopsodontids are closely related to horses and brontotheres, despite their more primitive overall appearance.
*Desmostylia and Anthracobunidae have traditionally been placed among the afrotheres, but they may actually represent stem-perissodactyls. They are an early lineage of mammals that took to the water, spreading across semi-aquatic to fully marine niches in the Tethys Ocean and the northern Pacific. However, later studies have shown that, while anthracobunids are definite perissodactyls, desmostylians have enough mixed characters to suggest that a position among the Afrotheria is not out of the question.

===Higher classification of perissodactyls===

Relationships within the large group of odd-toed ungulates are not fully understood. Initially, after the establishment of &quot;Perissodactyla&quot; by Richard Owen in 1848, the present-day representatives were considered equal in rank. In the first half of the 20th century, a more systematic differentiation of odd-toed ungulates began, based on a consideration of fossil forms, and they were placed in two major suborders: Hippomorpha and Ceratomorpha. The Hippomorpha comprises today&#x27;s horses and their extinct members (Equoidea); the Ceratomorpha consist of tapirs and rhinos plus their extinct members (Tapiroidea and Rhinocerotoidea). The names Hippomorpha and Ceratomorpha were introduced in 1937 by Horace Elmer Wood, in response to criticism of the name &quot;Solidungula&quot; that he proposed three years previously. It had been based on the grouping of horses and Tridactyla and on the rhinoceros/tapir complex. The extinct brontotheriidae were also classified under Hippomorpha and therefore possess a close relationship to horses. Some researchers accept this assignment because of similar dental features, but there is also the view that a very basal position within the odd-toed ungulates places them rather in the group of &quot;Titanotheriomorpha&quot;.

Originally, the Chalicotheriidae were seen as members of Hippomorpha, and presented as such in 1941. William Berryman Scott thought that, as claw-bearing perissodactyls, they belong in the new suborder Ancylopoda (where Ceratomorpha and Hippomorpha as odd-toed ungulates were combined in the group of Chelopoda). The term Ancylopoda, coined by Edward Drinker Cope in 1889, had been established for chalicotheres. However, further morphological studies from the 1960s showed a middle position of Ancylopoda between Hippomorpha and Ceratomorpha. Leonard Burton Radinsky saw all three major groups of odd-toed ungulates as peers, based on the extremely long and independent phylogenetic development of the three lines. In the 1980s, Jeremy J. Hooker saw a general similarity between Ancylopoda and Ceratomorpha based on dentition, especially in the earliest members, leading to the unification in 1984 of the two submissions in the interim order, &quot;Tapiromorpha&quot;. At the same time, he expanded the Ancylopoda to include the &quot;Lophiodontidae&quot;. The name &quot;Tapiromorpha&quot; goes back to Ernst Haeckel, who coined it in 1873, but it was long considered synonymous to Ceratomorpha because Wood had not considered it in 1937 when Ceratomorpha were named, since the term had been used quite differently in the past. Also in 1984, Robert M. Schoch used the conceptually similar term Moropomorpha, which today applies synonymously to Tapiromorpha. Included within the Tapiromorpha are the now extinct Isectolophidae, a sister group of the Ancylopoda-Ceratomorpha group and thus the most primitive members of this relationship complex.

==Evolutionary history==

===Origins===
The evolutionary development of Perissodactyla is well documented in the fossil record. Numerous finds are evidence of the adaptive radiation of this group, which was once much more varied and widely dispersed. &quot;Radinskya&quot; from the late Paleocene of East Asia is often considered to be one of the oldest close relatives of the ungulates. Its 8 cm skull must have belonged to a very small and primitive animal with a π-shaped crown pattern on the enamel of its rear molars similar to that of perissodactyls and their relatives, especially the rhinos. Finds of &quot;Cambaytherium&quot; and &quot;Kalitherium&quot; in the Cambay shale of western India indicate an origin in Asia dating to the Lower Eocene roughly 54.5 million years ago. Their teeth also show similarities to &quot;Radinskya&quot; as well as to the Tethytheria clade. The saddle-shaped configuration of the navicular joints and the mesaxonic construction of the front and hind feet also indicates a close relationship to Tethytheria. However, this construction deviates from that of &quot;Cambaytherium&quot;, indicating that it is actually a member of a sister group. Ancestors of Perissodactyla may have arrived via an island bridge from the Afro-Arab landmass onto the Indian subcontinent as it drifted north towards Asia. A study on &quot;Cambaytherium&quot; suggests an origin in India prior or near its collision with Asia.

The alignment of hyopsodontids and phenacodontids to Perissodactyla in general suggests an older Laurasian origin and distribution for the clade, dispersed across the northern continents already in the early Paleocene. These forms already show a fairly well-developed molar morphology, with no intermediary forms as evidence of the course of its development. The close relationship between meridiungulate mammals and perissoodactyls in particular is of interest since the latter appeared in South America soon after the K–T event, implying rapid ecological radiation and dispersal after mass extinction.

===Phylogeny===

The Perissodactyla appeared relatively abruptly at the beginning of the Lower Paleocene about 63 million years ago, both in North America and Asia, in the form of phenacodontids and hyopsodontids. The oldest finds from an extant group originate among other sources, from &quot;Sifrhippus&quot;, an ancestor of the horses from the Willswood lineup in northwestern Wyoming. The distant ancestors of tapirs appeared not too long after that in the Ghazij lineup in Balochistan, such as &quot;Ganderalophus&quot;, as well as &quot;Litolophus&quot; from the Chalicotheriidae line, or &quot;Eotitanops&quot; from the group of brontotheriidae. Initially, the members of the different lineages looked quite similar, with an arched back and generally four toes on the front and three on the hind feet. &quot;Eohippus&quot;, which is considered a member of the horse family, outwardly resembled &quot;Hyrachyus&quot;, the first representative of the rhino and tapir line. All were small compared to later forms and lived as fruit and foliage eaters in forests. The first of the megafauna to emerge were the brontotheres, in the Middle and Upper Eocene. &quot;Megacerops&quot;, known from North America, reached a withers height of and could have weighed just over . The decline of brontotheres at the end of the Eocene is associated with competition arising from the advent of more successful herbivores.

More successful lines of odd-toed ungulates emerged at the end of the Eocene when dense jungles gave way to steppe, such as the chalicotheriid rhinos, and their immediate relatives; their development also began with very small forms. &quot;Paraceratherium&quot;, one of the largest mammals ever to walk the earth, evolved during this era. They weighed up to and lived throughout the Oligocene in Eurasia. About 20 million years ago, at the onset of the Miocene, the perissodactyls first reached Africa when it became connected to Eurasia because of the closing of the Tethys Ocean. For the same reason, however, new animals such as the mammoths also entered the ancient settlement areas of odd-toed ungulates, creating competition that led to the extinction of some of their lines. The rise of ruminants, which occupied similar ecological niches and had a much more efficient digestive system, is also associated with the decline in diversity of odd-toed ungulates. A significant cause for the decline of perissodactyls was climate change during the Miocene, leading to a cooler and drier climate accompanied by the spread of open landscapes. However, some lines flourished, such as the horses and rhinos; anatomical adaptations made it possible for them to consume tougher grass food. This led to open land forms that dominated newly created landscapes. With the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama in the Pliocene, perissodactyls and other megafauna were given access to one of their last habitable continents: South America. However, many perissodactyls became extinct at the end of the ice ages, including American horses and the &quot;Elasmotherium&quot;. Whether over-hunting by humans (overkill hypothesis), climatic change, or a combination of both factors was responsible for the extinction of ice age mega-fauna, remains controversial.

==Research history==

In 1758, in his seminal work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, Linnaeus (1707–1778) classified horses (&quot;Equus&quot;) together with hippos (&quot;Hippopotamus&quot;). At that time, this category also included the tapirs (&quot;Tapirus&quot;), more precisely the lowland or South American tapir (&quot;Tapirus terrestus&quot;), the only tapir then known in Europe. Linnaeus classified this tapir as &quot;Hippopotamus terrestris&quot; and put both genera in the group of the &quot;Belluae&quot; (&quot;beasts&quot;). He combined the rhinos with the Glires, a group now consisting of the lagomorphs and rodents. Mathurin Jacques Brisson (1723–1806) first separated the tapirs and hippos in 1762 with the introduction of the concept &quot;le tapir&quot;. He also separated the rhinos from the rodents, but did not combine the three families now known as the odd-toed ungulates. In the transition to the 19th century, the individual perissodactyl genera were associated with various other groups, such as the proboscidean and even-toed ungulates. In 1795, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844) and Georges Cuvier (1769–1832) introduced the term &quot;pachyderm&quot; (Pachydermata), including in it not only the rhinos and elephants, but also the hippos, pigs, peccaries, tapirs and hyrax. The horses were still generally regarded as a group separate from other mammals and were often classified under the name &quot;Solidungula&quot; or &quot;Solipèdes&quot;, meaning &quot;one-hoof animal&quot;.

In 1861, Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville (1777–1850) classified ungulates by the structure of their feet, differentiating those with an even number of toes from those with an odd number. He moved the horses as &quot;solidungulate&quot; over to the tapirs and rhinos as &quot;multungulate&quot; animals and referred to all of them together as &quot;onguligrades à doigts impairs&quot;, coming close to the concept of the odd-toed ungulate as a systematic unit. Richard Owen (1804–1892) quoted Blainville in his study on fossil mammals of the Isle of Wight and introduced the name &quot;Perissodactyla&quot;.

In 1884, Othniel Charles Marsh (1831–1899) came up with the concept &quot;Mesaxonia&quot;, which he used for what are today called the odd-toed ungulates, including their extinct relatives, but explicitly excluding the hyrax. &quot;Mesaxonia&quot; is now considered a synonym of &quot;Perissodactyla&quot;, but it was sometimes also used for the true odd-toed ungulates as a subcategory (rhinos, horses, tapirs), while &quot;Perissodactyla&quot; stood for the entire order, including the hyrax. The assumption that hyraxes were &quot;Perissodactyla&quot; was held well into the 20th century. Only with the advent of molecular genetic research methods had it been recognized that the hyrax was not closely related to perissodactyls but rather to elephants and manatees.

==Interactions with humans==

The domestic horse and the donkey play an important role in human history, particularly as transport, work and pack animals. The domestication of both species began several millennia BCE. Due to the motorisation of agriculture and the spread of automobile traffic, such use has declined sharply in Western industrial countries; riding is usually undertaken more as a hobby or sport. In less developed regions of the world, traditional uses for these animals are, however, still widespread. To a lesser extent, horses and donkeys are also kept for their meat and their milk.

In contrast, the existence in the wild of almost all other odd-toed ungulates species has declined dramatically because of hunting and habitat destruction. The quagga is extinct and Przewalski&#x27;s horse was once eradicated in the wild.

Present threat levels, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (2012):

*Four species are considered critically endangered: the Javan rhinoceros, the Sumatran rhinoceros, the black rhinoceros and the African wild ass.
*Six species are endangered: the mountain tapir, the Central American tapir, the Malayan tapir, the wild horse and Grévy&#x27;s zebra.
*Three species are considered vulnerable: the Indian rhinoceros, the South American tapir and the mountain zebra.
*The onager, the plains zebra and the white rhinoceros are near-threatened; however, the northern subspecies, &quot;Ceratotherium simum cottoni&quot; (northern white rhinoceros) is close to extinction.
*The kiang is not considered at risk (least concern).
=== Conservation ===
Hunting and habitat loss due to land conversion and human encroachment are the most significant threats to the three endangered species of tapir. The Malayan tapir&#x27;s inland forest habitat is of particular concern, as this land is being deforested rapidly and converted into palm oil plantations. Climate change is shifting the suitable range of mountain tapirs further up the Andes Mountains, reducing their available habitat. Hunting of mountain and Baird&#x27;s tapirs in Central and South America for their meat is common and is made easier by climate change, as population densities are forcibly increased. Although hunting is illegal in protected areas throughout this region, regulations are often ignored or unenforced. Conservation efforts for tapirs primarily consist of legal protections from hunting and international trade, though proposals of habitat protection and restoration at the local level are underway in all affected countries.

<text>Pai gow ( ; ) is a Chinese gambling game, played with a set of 32 Chinese dominoes. It is played in major casinos in China (including Macau); the United States (including Boston, Massachusetts; Las Vegas, Nevada; Reno, Nevada; Connecticut; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Pennsylvania; Mississippi; and cardrooms in California); Canada (including Edmonton, Alberta and Calgary, Alberta); Australia; and New Zealand.

The name &quot;pai gow&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a card game called pai gow poker (or &quot;double-hand poker&quot;), which is loosely based on pai gow. The act of playing pai gow is also colloquially known as &quot;eating dog meat&quot;.

== History ==
Although some claim that Pai Gow is the first documented form of dominoes, originating in China before or during the Song dynasty., which can only apply to &quot;gu pai&quot; 骨牌, that is, Chinese dominoes, the game of &quot;pai gow&quot; (Mandarin &quot;paijiu&quot;) is not recorded until the late 19th century. Its earliest description is to be found in a collection of Cantonese games published in Hong Kong in 1886.

The name literally means &quot;card nine&quot;, after the normal maximum hand. It is assumed that the original game was modeled after both a Chinese creation myth, and military organization in China at that time (ranks one through nine), but no document supports this theory.

== Rules ==

=== Starting ===
Tiles are shuffled on the table and are arranged into eight face-down stacks of four tiles each in an assembly known as the &quot;woodpile&quot;. Individual stacks or tiles may then be moved in specific ways to rearrange the woodpile, after which the players place their bets.

Next, each player (including the dealer) is given one stack of tiles and must use them to form two hands of two tiles each. The hand with the lower value is called the &quot;front hand&quot;, and the hand with the higher value is called the &quot;rear hand&quot;. If a player&#x27;s front hand beats the dealer&#x27;s front hand, and the player&#x27;s rear hand beats the dealer&#x27;s rear hand, then that player wins the bet and is paid off at 1:1 odds (even money). If a player&#x27;s front and rear hands both lose to the dealer&#x27;s respective hands, the player loses the bet. If one hand wins and the other loses, the player is said to &quot;push&quot;, and gets back only the money he or she bet. Generally seven players will play, and each player&#x27;s hands are compared only against the dealer&#x27;s hands; comparisons are always front-front and rear-rear, never one of each.

There are 35,960 possible ways to select 4 of the 32 tiles when the 32 tiles are considered distinguishable. However, there are 3,620 distinct sets of 4 tiles when the tiles of a pair are considered indistinguishable. There are 496 ways to select 2 of the 32 tiles when the 32 tiles are considered distinguishable. There are 136 distinct hands (pairs of tiles) when the tiles of a pair are considered indistinguishable.

=== Scoring ===
Each player groups their four tiles into two hands of two tiles each. The two hands are referred to as the &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; hands, based on their score.

The highest-ranked hands are formed from the sixteen &quot;named pairs&quot;. Otherwise, the next highest-ranked hand results from creating a &quot;Gong&quot; or &quot;Wong&quot;, which are specific combinations with the &quot;Day&quot; and &quot;Teen&quot; tiles. If the four tiles drawn for the two hands do not permit the formation of a named pair, Gong, or Wong, then the total number of pips on both tiles in a hand are added using modular arithmetic (modulo 10), equivalent to how a hand in baccarat is scored.

The name &quot;pai gow&quot; is loosely translated as &quot;make nine&quot; or &quot;card nine&quot;. This reflects the fact that, with the exception of named pairs, Gong, or Wong, the maximum score for a hand of mixed tiles is nine.

==== Named pairs ====

The 32 tiles in a Chinese dominoes set can be arranged into 16 named pairs. Eleven of these pairs have identical tiles, and five of these pairs are made up of two tiles that have the same total number of pips, but in different groupings. The latter group includes the Gee Joon tiles, which can score the same, whether as three or six.

Any hand consisting of a pair outscores a non-pair, regardless of the pip counts. Named pairs are often thought of as being worth 12 points each, but there is a hierarchy within the named pairs.

The pairs are considered to tell the story of creation:
# &quot;Gee Joon&quot; (至尊) is the highest ranked pair, and is the Supreme Creator of the universe
# &quot;Teen&quot; (天) is the , the first thing Gee Joon created.
# &quot;Day&quot; (地) is the earth itself, placed under the heavens.
# &quot;Yun&quot; (人) is man, whom Gee Joon made to live upon the earth.
# &quot;Gor&quot; (鵝) is geese, made for man to eat.
# &quot;Mooy&quot; (梅) is plum flowers, to give the earth beauty.

Each subsequent pair is another step in the story...robes (&quot;Bon&quot;) for man to wear, a hatchet (&quot;Foo&quot;) to chop wood, partitions (&quot;Ping&quot;) for a house, man&#x27;s seventh (&quot;Tit&quot;) and eighth (&quot;Look&quot;) children.
Only the sixteen named pairs are valid. For example, if a hand contained a &quot;Yun&quot; (4-4) and a &quot;Chop Bot&quot; (3-5 or 2-6), these would not form a pair at all, despite both tiles having eight pips each. A Yun (4-4) exclusively pairs with the other Yun, and likewise only the two Chop Bot tiles can be paired together. Likewise, tiles with six pips (&quot;Look&quot;, 1-5, pairs with another Look, not the &quot;Gee Joon&quot; 2-4) and seven pips (&quot;Tit&quot;, 1-6, pairs with another Tit, not the two &quot;Chop Chit&quot; tiles 2-5 and 3-4, which pair with each other) are subject to the same pairing restrictions.

When the player and dealer both have a pair, the higher-ranked pair wins. Ranking pairs is determined not by the sum of the tiles&#x27; pips, but rather by aesthetics; the order must be memorized. The highest pairs are the Gee Joon tiles, the Teens, the Days, and the red eights. The lowest pairs are the mismatched nines, eights, sevens, and fives.

==== Wongs and Gongs ====

The double-one tiles and double-six tiles are known as the &quot;Day&quot; and &quot;Teen&quot; tiles, respectively. The combination of a Day or Teen with a nine (&quot;Gow&quot;, 5-4 or 6-3) creates a &quot;Wong&quot;, worth 11 points, while putting either of them with an eight (either &quot;Yun&quot;, 4-4; or &quot;Bot&quot;, 5-3 or 6-2) results in a &quot;Gong&quot;, worth 10. Gongs and Wongs formed with a Teen tile are ranked higher than those formed with a Day tile.

However, if a Day or Teen is grouped in a single hand with any other tile, the standard scoring rules apply. The combination of a Day or Teen with a seven (&quot;Tit&quot;, 1-6; or &quot;Chit&quot;, 2-5 or 3-4) is sometimes referred to as a &quot;high nine&quot;, as the score is the maximum (nine) when added together, and the group contains a high-rank tile for potential tiebreaking purposes.

==== Modular arithmetic ====

When a hand is formed from two tiles that are not a named pair, Wong, or Gong, the total pips on both tiles are counted and any tens digit is dropped; the resulting ones digit (the sum of all pips modulo 10) gives the final score.

There is one exception. The 1-2 and the 2-4 tiles which form the &quot;Gee Joon&quot; pair together, can act as limited wild cards singly. When used as part of a hand of mixed tiles, these tiles may be scored as either 3 or 6, whichever results in a higher hand value. For example, a hand of 1-2 (scored as +6 instead of the face value of +3) and 5-6 (+11) scores as seven rather than four.

If the player has both the 1-2 and 2-4 tiles, those collectively form the highest-ranked named pair and should be used together to form an unbeatable rear hand.

=== Ties ===
When the player and dealer display hands with the same score, the one with the highest-valued tile (based on the named pair rankings described above) is the winner. For example, a player&#x27;s hand of 3-4 and 2-2 (&quot;Chit&quot; and &quot;Bon&quot;) and a dealer&#x27;s hand of 5-6 and 5-5 (&quot;Foo&quot; and &quot;Mooy&quot;) would each score one point. However, since the dealer&#x27;s 5-5 (&quot;Mooy&quot;) outranks the other three tiles, he would win the hand.

If both have a bonus combination (Wong or Gong) or the scores are tied, and if the player and dealer each have an identical highest-ranking tile, then the dealer wins. For example, if the player held 2-2 and 1–6 (&quot;Bon&quot; and &quot;Tit&quot;), and the dealer held 2-2 and 3–4 (&quot;Bon&quot; and &quot;Chit&quot;), the dealer would win since the scores (1 each) and the highest-ranked tiles (2-2 &quot;Bon&quot;) are the same. The lower-ranked tile in each hand is never used to break a tie.

There are two exceptions to the method described above. First, although the Gee Joon tiles form the highest-ranking pair when used together, when used as single tiles in a mixed hand, for tiebreaking purposes, they fall into the mixed-number ranks according to the number of pips. That is, the 2-4 ranks sequentially below the &quot;Chop Chit&quot; tiles (3-4 and 2-5), and the 1-2 ranks sequentially last overall, below the &quot;Chop Ng&quot; tiles (3-2 and 1-4). Second, any zero-zero tie is won by the dealer, regardless of the tiles in the two hands.

== Strategy ==

The key element of pai gow strategy is to present the optimal front and rear hands based on the tiles dealt to the player. For any four random tiles, there are three ways to arrange them into two hands, assuming that a named pair cannot be formed. However, if there is at least one pair among the tiles, there are only two distinct ways to form two hands.

The player must decide which combination is most likely to give a set of front/rear hands that can beat the dealer, or at least break a tie in the player&#x27;s favor. In some cases, a player with weaker tiles may deliberately attempt to attain a push so as to avoid losing the bet outright. Many players rely on superstition or tradition to choose tile pairings.

The film &quot;Premium Rush&quot; (2012) features Pai Gow play as an integral plot element.

<text>In mathematics, especially order theory, a partial order on a set is an arrangement such that, for certain pairs of elements, one precedes the other. The word &quot;partial&quot; is used to indicate that not every pair of elements needs to be comparable; that is, there may be pairs for which neither element precedes the other. Partial orders thus generalize total orders, in which every pair is comparable.

Formally, a partial order is a homogeneous binary relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. A partially ordered set (poset for short) is an ordered pair formula_1 consisting of a set formula_2 (called the &quot;ground set&quot; of formula_3) and a partial order formula_4 on formula_2. When the meaning is clear from context and there is no ambiguity about the partial order, the set formula_2 itself is sometimes called a poset.

== Partial order relations ==
The term &quot;partial order&quot; usually refers to the reflexive partial order relations, referred to in this article as &quot;non-strict&quot; partial orders. However some authors use the term for the other common type of partial order relations, the irreflexive partial order relations, also called strict partial orders. Strict and non-strict partial orders can be put into a one-to-one correspondence, so for every strict partial order there is a unique corresponding non-strict partial order, and vice versa.

=== Partial orders ===

A reflexive, weak, or , commonly referred to simply as a partial order, is a homogeneous relation ≤ on a set formula_3 that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. That is, for all formula_8 it must satisfy:
# Reflexivity: formula_9, i.e. every element is related to itself.
# Antisymmetry: if formula_10 and formula_11 then formula_12, i.e. no two distinct elements precede each other.
# Transitivity: if formula_13 and formula_14 then formula_15.

A non-strict partial order is also known as an antisymmetric preorder.

=== Strict partial orders ===

An irreflexive, strong, or is a homogeneous relation &lt; on a set formula_3 that is irreflexive, asymmetric and transitive; that is, it satisfies the following conditions for all formula_17
# Irreflexivity: formula_18, i.e. no element is related to itself (also called anti-reflexive).
# Asymmetry: if formula_19 then not formula_20.
# Transitivity: if formula_19 and formula_22 then formula_23.

A transitive relation is asymmetric if and only if it is irreflexive. So the definition is the same if it omits either irreflexivity or asymmetry (but not both).

A strict partial order is also known as an asymmetric strict preorder.

=== Correspondence of strict and non-strict partial order relations ===
Strict and non-strict partial orders on a set formula_3 are closely related. A non-strict partial order formula_4 may be converted to a strict partial order by removing all relationships of the form formula_26 that is, the strict partial order is the set formula_27 where formula_28 is the identity relation on formula_29 and formula_30 denotes set subtraction. Conversely, a strict partial order &lt; on formula_3 may be converted to a non-strict partial order by adjoining all relationships of that form; that is, formula_32 is a non-strict partial order. Thus, if formula_4 is a non-strict partial order, then the corresponding strict partial order &lt; is the irreflexive kernel given by
formula_34
Conversely, if &lt; is a strict partial order, then the corresponding non-strict partial order formula_4 is the reflexive closure given by:
formula_36

=== Dual orders ===
The &quot;dual&quot; (or &quot;opposite&quot;) formula_37 of a partial order relation formula_38 is defined by letting formula_37 be the converse relation of formula_38, i.e. formula_41 if and only if formula_42. The dual of a non-strict partial order is a non-strict partial order, and the dual of a strict partial order is a strict partial order. The dual of a dual of a relation is the original relation.

== Notation ==

Given a set formula_3 and a partial order relation, typically the non-strict partial order formula_4, we may uniquely extend our notation to define four partial order relations formula_45 formula_46 formula_47 and formula_48, where formula_4 is a non-strict partial order relation on formula_3, formula_51 is the associated strict partial order relation on formula_3 (the irreflexive kernel of formula_4), formula_54 is the dual of formula_4, and formula_56 is the dual of formula_51. Strictly speaking, the term &quot;partially ordered set&quot; refers to a set with all of these relations defined appropriately. But practically, one need only consider a single relation, formula_58 or formula_59, or, in rare instances, the non-strict and strict relations together, formula_60. 

The term &quot;ordered set&quot; is sometimes used as a shorthand for &quot;partially ordered set&quot;, as long as it is clear from the context that no other kind of order is meant. In particular, totally ordered sets can also be referred to as &quot;ordered sets&quot;, especially in areas where these structures are more common than posets. Some authors use different symbols than formula_4 such as formula_62 or formula_63 to distinguish partial orders from total orders.

When referring to partial orders, formula_4 should not be taken as the complement of formula_56. The relation formula_56 is the converse of the irreflexive kernel of formula_4, which is always a subset of the complement of formula_4, but formula_56 is equal to the complement of formula_4 if, and only if, formula_4 is a total order.

== Alternative definitions ==

Another way of defining a partial order, found in computer science, is via a notion of comparison. Specifically, given formula_72 as defined previously, it can be observed that two elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; may stand in any of four mutually exclusive relationships to each other: either , or , or , or &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are &quot;incomparable&quot;. This can be represented by a function formula_73 that returns one of four codes when given two elements. This definition is equivalent to a &quot;partial order on a setoid&quot;, where equality is taken to be a defined equivalence relation rather than set equality.

Wallis defines a more general notion of a &quot;partial order relation&quot; as any homogeneous relation that is transitive and antisymmetric. This includes both reflexive and irreflexive partial orders as subtypes.

A finite poset can be visualized through its Hasse diagram. Specifically, taking a strict partial order relation formula_59, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) may be constructed by taking each element of formula_3 to be a node and each element of formula_51 to be an edge. The transitive reduction of this DAG is then the Hasse diagram. Similarly this process can be reversed to construct strict partial orders from certain DAGs. In contrast, the graph associated to a non-strict partial order has self-loops at every node and therefore is not a DAG; when a non-strict order is said to be depicted by a Hasse diagram, actually the corresponding strict order is shown.

== Examples ==

Standard examples of posets arising in mathematics include:
* The real numbers, or in general any totally ordered set, ordered by the standard &quot;less-than-or-equal&quot; relation ≤, is a partial order.
* On the real numbers formula_77, the usual less than relation &lt; is a strict partial order. The same is also true of the usual greater than relation &gt; on formula_78.
* By definition, every strict weak order is a strict partial order.
* The set of subsets of a given set (its power set) ordered by inclusion (see Fig. 1). Similarly, the set of sequences ordered by subsequence, and the set of strings ordered by substring.
* The set of natural numbers equipped with the relation of divisibility. (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 6)
* The vertex set of a directed acyclic graph ordered by reachability.
* The set of subspaces of a vector space ordered by inclusion.
* For a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot;, the sequence space containing all sequences of elements from &quot;P&quot;, where sequence &quot;a&quot; precedes sequence &quot;b&quot; if every item in &quot;a&quot; precedes the corresponding item in &quot;b&quot;. Formally, formula_79 if and only if formula_80 for all formula_81; that is, a componentwise order.
* For a set &quot;X&quot; and a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot;, the function space containing all functions from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;P&quot;, where if and only if for all formula_82
* A fence, a partially ordered set defined by an alternating sequence of order relations 
* The set of events in special relativity and, in most cases, general relativity, where for two events &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, if and only if &quot;Y&quot; is in the future light cone of &quot;X&quot;. An event &quot;Y&quot; can be causally affected by &quot;X&quot; only if .

One familiar example of a partially ordered set is a collection of people ordered by genealogical descendancy. Some pairs of people bear the descendant-ancestor relationship, but other pairs of people are incomparable, with neither being a descendant of the other.

=== Orders on the Cartesian product of partially ordered sets ===

In order of increasing strength, i.e., decreasing sets of pairs, three of the possible partial orders on the Cartesian product of two partially ordered sets are (see Fig. 4):
* the lexicographical order:   if or ( and );
* the product order:   (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) ≤ (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;d&quot;;
* the reflexive closure of the direct product of the corresponding strict orders:   if ( and ) or ( and ).

All three can similarly be defined for the Cartesian product of more than two sets.

Applied to ordered vector spaces over the same field, the result is in each case also an ordered vector space.

See also orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets.

=== Sums of partially ordered sets ===

Another way to combine two (disjoint) posets is the ordinal sum (or linear sum), , defined on the union of the underlying sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; by the order if and only if:
* &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; with &quot;a&quot; ≤&quot;X&quot; &quot;b&quot;, or
* &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot; with &quot;a&quot; ≤&quot;Y&quot; &quot;b&quot;, or
* &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot;.

If two posets are well-ordered, then so is their ordinal sum.

Series-parallel partial orders are formed from the ordinal sum operation (in this context called series composition) and another operation called parallel composition. Parallel composition is the disjoint union of two partially ordered sets, with no order relation between elements of one set and elements of the other set.

== Derived notions ==

The examples use the poset formula_83 consisting of the set of all subsets of a three-element set formula_84 ordered by set inclusion (see Fig. 1).
* &quot;a&quot; is &quot;related to&quot; &quot;b&quot; when &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;. This does not imply that &quot;b&quot; is also related to &quot;a&quot;, because the relation need not be symmetric. For example, formula_85 is related to formula_86 but not the reverse.
* &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are &quot;comparable&quot; if or . Otherwise they are &quot;incomparable&quot;. For example, formula_85 and formula_88 are comparable, while formula_85 and formula_90 are not.
* A &quot;total order&quot; or &quot;linear order&quot; is a partial order under which every pair of elements is comparable, i.e. trichotomy holds. For example, the natural numbers with their standard order.
* A &quot;chain&quot; is a subset of a poset that is a totally ordered set. For example, formula_91 is a chain.
* An &quot;antichain&quot; is a subset of a poset in which no two distinct elements are comparable. For example, the set of singletons formula_92
* An element &quot;a&quot; is said to be &quot;strictly less than&quot; an element &quot;b&quot;, if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and formula_93 For example, formula_85 is strictly less than formula_95
* An element &quot;a&quot; is said to be &quot;covered&quot; by another element &quot;b&quot;, written &quot;a&quot; ⋖ &quot;b&quot; (or &quot;a&quot; &lt;: &quot;b&quot;), if &quot;a&quot; is strictly less than &quot;b&quot; and no third element &quot;c&quot; fits between them; formally: if both &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and formula_96 are true, and &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; is false for each &quot;c&quot; with formula_97 Using the strict order &lt;, the relation &quot;a&quot; ⋖ &quot;b&quot; can be equivalently rephrased as &quot; but not for any &quot;c&quot;&quot;. For example, formula_85 is covered by formula_99 but is not covered by formula_100

=== Extrema ===
There are several notions of &quot;greatest&quot; and &quot;least&quot; element in a poset formula_101 notably:
* Greatest element and least element: An element formula_102 is a if formula_103 for every element formula_104 An element formula_105 is a if formula_106 for every element formula_104 A poset can only have one greatest or least element. In our running example, the set formula_88 is the greatest element, and formula_109 is the least.
* Maximal elements and minimal elements: An element formula_102 is a maximal element if there is no element formula_111 such that formula_112 Similarly, an element formula_105 is a minimal element if there is no element formula_111 such that formula_115 If a poset has a greatest element, it must be the unique maximal element, but otherwise there can be more than one maximal element, and similarly for least elements and minimal elements. In our running example, formula_88 and formula_109 are the maximal and minimal elements. Removing these, there are 3 maximal elements and 3 minimal elements (see Fig. 5).
* Upper and lower bounds: For a subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, an element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot; is an upper bound of &quot;A&quot; if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;, for each element &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;. In particular, &quot;x&quot; need not be in &quot;A&quot; to be an upper bound of &quot;A&quot;. Similarly, an element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot; is a lower bound of &quot;A&quot; if &quot;a&quot; ≥ &quot;x&quot;, for each element &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;. A greatest element of &quot;P&quot; is an upper bound of &quot;P&quot; itself, and a least element is a lower bound of &quot;P&quot;. In our example, the set formula_118 is an for the collection of elements formula_119
As another example, consider the positive integers, ordered by divisibility: 1 is a least element, as it divides all other elements; on the other hand this poset does not have a greatest element. This partially ordered set does not even have any maximal elements, since any &quot;g&quot; divides for instance 2&quot;g&quot;, which is distinct from it, so &quot;g&quot; is not maximal. If the number 1 is excluded, while keeping divisibility as ordering on the elements greater than 1, then the resulting poset does not have a least element, but any prime number is a minimal element for it. In this poset, 60 is an upper bound (though not a least upper bound) of the subset formula_120 which does not have any lower bound (since 1 is not in the poset); on the other hand 2 is a lower bound of the subset of powers of 2, which does not have any upper bound. If the number 0 is included, this will be the greatest element, since this is a multiple of every integer (see Fig. 6).

== Mappings between partially ordered sets ==

Given two partially ordered sets and , a function formula_121 is called order-preserving, or monotone, or isotone, if for all formula_122 formula_123 implies .
If is also a partially ordered set, and both formula_121 and formula_125 are order-preserving, their composition formula_126 is order-preserving, too.
A function formula_121 is called order-reflecting if for all formula_122 implies formula_129
If is both order-preserving and order-reflecting, then it is called an order-embedding of into .
In the latter case, is necessarily injective, since formula_130 implies formula_131 and in turn formula_132 according to the antisymmetry of formula_133 If an order-embedding between two posets &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; exists, one says that &quot;S&quot; can be embedded into &quot;T&quot;. If an order-embedding formula_121 is bijective, it is called an order isomorphism, and the partial orders and are said to be isomorphic. Isomorphic orders have structurally similar Hasse diagrams (see Fig. 7a). It can be shown that if order-preserving maps formula_121 and formula_125 exist such that formula_137 and formula_138 yields the identity function on &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, respectively, then &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are order-isomorphic.

For example, a mapping formula_139 from the set of natural numbers (ordered by divisibility) to the power set of natural numbers (ordered by set inclusion) can be defined by taking each number to the set of its prime divisors. It is order-preserving: if divides , then each prime divisor of is also a prime divisor of . However, it is neither injective (since it maps both 12 and 6 to formula_140) nor order-reflecting (since 12 does not divide 6). Taking instead each number to the set of its prime power divisors defines a map formula_141 that is order-preserving, order-reflecting, and hence an order-embedding. It is not an order-isomorphism (since it, for instance, does not map any number to the set formula_142), but it can be made one by restricting its codomain to formula_143 Fig. 7b shows a subset of formula_144 and its isomorphic image under . The construction of such an order-isomorphism into a power set can be generalized to a wide class of partial orders, called distributive lattices; see &quot;Birkhoff&#x27;s representation theorem&quot;.

== Number of partial orders ==
Sequence [ A001035] in OEIS gives the number of partial orders on a set of &quot;n&quot; labeled elements:

The number of strict partial orders is the same as that of partial orders.

If the count is made only up to isomorphism, the sequence 1, 1, 2, 5, 16, 63, 318, ... is obtained.

== Subposets ==
A poset formula_145 is called a subposet of another poset formula_146 provided that formula_147 is a subset of formula_2 and formula_149 is a subset of formula_4. The latter condition is equivalent to the requirement that for any formula_151 and formula_152 in formula_147 (and thus also in formula_2), if formula_155 then formula_123.

If formula_157 is a subposet of formula_3 and furthermore, for all formula_151 and formula_152 in formula_147, whenever formula_123 we also have formula_155, then we call formula_157 the subposet of formula_3 induced by formula_147, and write formula_167.

== Linear extension ==
A partial order formula_149 on a set formula_2 is called an extension of another partial order formula_4 on formula_2 provided that for all elements formula_172 whenever formula_173 it is also the case that formula_174 A linear extension is an extension that is also a linear (that is, total) order. As a classic example, the lexicographic order of totally ordered sets is a linear extension of their product order. Every partial order can be extended to a total order (order-extension principle).

In computer science, algorithms for finding linear extensions of partial orders (represented as the reachability orders of directed acyclic graphs) are called topological sorting.

== In category theory ==

Every poset (and every preordered set) may be considered as a category where, for objects formula_151 and formula_176 there is at most one morphism from formula_151 to formula_178 More explicitly, let if (and otherwise the empty set) and formula_179 Such categories are sometimes called &quot;posetal&quot;.

Posets are equivalent to one another if and only if they are isomorphic. In a poset, the smallest element, if it exists, is an initial object, and the largest element, if it exists, is a terminal object. Also, every preordered set is equivalent to a poset. Finally, every subcategory of a poset is isomorphism-closed.

== Partial orders in topological spaces ==
If formula_3 is a partially ordered set that has also been given the structure of a topological space, then it is customary to assume that formula_181 is a closed subset of the topological product space formula_182 Under this assumption partial order relations are well behaved at limits in the sense that if formula_183 and formula_184 and for all formula_185 formula_186 then formula_187

== Intervals ==
A convex set in a poset &quot;P&quot; is a subset of &quot;P&quot; with the property that, for any &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in and any &quot;z&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;, then &quot;z&quot; is also in . This definition generalizes the definition of intervals of real numbers. When there is possible confusion with convex sets of geometry, one uses order-convex instead of &quot;convex&quot;.

A convex sublattice of a lattice &quot;L&quot; is a sublattice of &quot;L&quot; that is also a convex set of &quot;L&quot;. Every nonempty convex sublattice can be uniquely represented as the intersection of a filter and an ideal of &quot;L&quot;.

An interval in a poset &quot;P&quot; is a subset that can be defined with interval notation:
* For &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;, the &quot;closed interval&quot; is the set of elements &quot;x&quot; satisfying (that is, and ). It contains at least the elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.
* Using the corresponding strict relation &quot;&lt;&quot;, the &quot;open interval&quot; is the set of elements &quot;x&quot; satisfying (i.e. and ). An open interval may be empty even if . For example, the open interval on the integers is empty since there is no integer such that .
* The &quot;half-open intervals&quot; and are defined similarly.

Whenever does not hold, all these intervals are empty. Every interval is a convex set, but the converse does not hold; for example, in the poset of divisors of 120, ordered by divisibility (see Fig. 7b), the set is convex, but not an interval.

An interval is bounded if there exist elements formula_188 such that . Every interval that can be represented in interval notation is obviously bounded, but the converse is not true. For example, let as a subposet of the real numbers. The subset is a bounded interval, but it has no infimum or supremum in &quot;P&quot;, so it cannot be written in interval notation using elements of &quot;P&quot;.

A poset is called locally finite if every bounded interval is finite. For example, the integers are locally finite under their natural ordering. The lexicographical order on the cartesian product formula_189 is not locally finite, since .
Using the interval notation, the property &quot;&quot;a&quot; is covered by &quot;b&quot;&quot; can be rephrased equivalently as formula_190

This concept of an interval in a partial order should not be confused with the particular class of partial orders known as the interval orders.

<doc id="23575" wikidata="Q125551" url="?curid=23575" title="Parmenides">
<text>Parmenides of Elea (; ; fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher from Elea in Magna Graecia (Southern Italy).

Parmenides was born in the Greek colony of Elea, from a wealthy and illustrious family. His dates are uncertain; according to doxographer Diogenes Laërtius, he flourished just before 500 BC, which would put his year of birth near 540 BC, but in the dialogue &quot;Parmenides&quot; Plato has him visiting Athens at the age of 65, when Socrates was a young man, , which, if true, suggests a year of birth of . He is thought to have been in his prime (or &quot;floruit&quot;) around 475 BC.

The single known work by Parmenides is a poem whose original title is unknown but which is often referred to as &quot;On Nature.&quot; Only fragments of it survive. In his poem, Parmenides prescribes two views of reality. The first, the Way of &quot;Aletheia&quot; or truth, describes how all reality is one, change is impossible, and existence is timeless and uniform. The second view, the way of &quot;Doxa&quot; or opinion, describes the world of appearances, in which one&#x27;s sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful.

Parmenides has been considered the founder of ontology and has, through his influence on Plato, influenced the whole history of Western philosophy. He is also considered to be the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy, which also included Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos. Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes of motion were developed to defend Parmenides&#x27;s views. In contemporary philosophy, Parmenides&#x27;s work has remained relevant in debates about the philosophy of time.

==Biography==
Parmenides was born in Elea (called Velia in Roman times), a city located in Magna Graecia. Diogenes Laertius says that his father was Pires, and that he belonged to a rich and noble family. Laertius transmits two divergent sources regarding the teacher of the philosopher. One, dependent on Sotion, indicates that he was first a student of Xenophanes, but did not follow him, and later became associated with a Pythagorean, Aminias, whom he preferred as his teacher. Another tradition, dependent on Theophrastus, indicates that he was a disciple of Anaximander.

===Chronology===
Everything related to the chronology of Parmenides—the dates of his birth and death, and the period of his philosophical activity—is uncertain.

==== Date of birth ====
All conjectures regarding Parmenides&#x27;s date of birth are based on two ancient sources. One comes from Apollodorus and is transmitted to us by Diogenes Laertius: this source marks the Olympiad 69th (between 504 BC and 500 BC) as the moment of maturity, placing his birth 40 years earlier (544 BC – 540 BC). The other is Plato, in his dialogue &quot;Parmenides&quot;. There Plato composes a situation in which Parmenides, 65, and Zeno, 40, travel to Athens to attend the Panathenaic Games. On that occasion they meet Socrates, who was still very young according to the Platonic text.

The inaccuracy of the dating from Apollodorus is well known, who chooses the date of a historical event to make it coincide with the maturity (the &quot;floruit&quot;) of a philosopher, a maturity that he invariably reached at forty years of age. He tries to always match the maturity of a philosopher with the birth of his alleged disciple. In this case Apollodorus, according to Burnet, based his date of the foundation of Elea (540 BC) to chronologically locate the maturity of Xenophanes and thus the birth of his supposed disciple, Parmenides. Knowing this, Burnet and later classicists like Cornford, Raven, Guthrie, and Schofield preferred to base the calculations on the Platonic dialogue. According to the latter, the fact that Plato adds so much detail regarding ages in his text is a sign that he writes with chronological precision. Plato says that Socrates was very young, and this is interpreted to mean that he was less than twenty years old. We know the year of Socrates&#x27; death (399 BC) and his age—he was about seventy years old–making the date of his birth 469 BC. The Panathenaic games were held every four years, and of those held during Socrates&#x27; youth (454, 450, 446), the most likely is that of 450 BC, when Socrates was nineteen years old. Thus, if at this meeting Parmenides was about sixty-five years old, his birth occurred around 515 BC.

However, neither Raven nor Schofield, who follows the former, finds a dating based on a late Platonic dialogue entirely satisfactory. Other scholars directly prefer not to use the Platonic testimony and propose other dates. According to a scholar of the Platonic dialogues, R. Hirzel, Conrado Eggers Lan indicates that the historical has no value for Plato. The fact that the meeting between Socrates and Parmenides is mentioned in the dialogues &quot;Theaetetus&quot; (183e) and &quot;Sophist&quot; (217c) only indicates that it is referring to the same fictional event, and this is possible because both the &quot;Theaetetus&quot; and the &quot;Sophist&quot; are considered after the &quot;Parmenides&quot;. In &quot;Soph.&quot; 217c the dialectic procedure of Socrates is attributed to Parmenides, which would confirm that this is nothing more than a reference to the fictitious dramatic situation of the dialogue. Eggers Lan proposes a correction of the traditional date of the foundation of Elea. Based on Herodotus I, 163–167, which indicates that the Phocians, after defeating the Carthaginians in naval battle, founded Elea, and adding the reference to Thucydides I, 13, where it is indicated that such a battle occurred in the time of Cambyses II, the foundation of Elea can be placed between 530 BC and 522 BC So Parmenides could not have been born before 530 BC or after 520 BC, given that it predates Empedocles. This last dating procedure is not infallible either, because it has been questioned that the fact that links the passages of Herodotus and Thucydides is the same. Nestor Luis Cordero also rejects the chronology based on the Platonic text, and the historical reality of the encounter, in favor of the traditional date of Apollodorus. He follows the traditional datum of the founding of Elea in 545 BC, pointing to it not only as &quot;terminus post quem&quot;, but as a possible date of Parmenides&#x27;s birth, from which he concludes that his parents were part of the founding contingent of the city and that he was a contemporary of Heraclitus. The evidence suggests that Parmenides could not have written much after the death of Heraclitus.

==== Timeline relative to other Presocratics ====
Beyond the speculations and inaccuracies about his date of birth, some specialists have turned their attention to certain passages of his work to specify the relationship of Parmenides with other thinkers. It was thought to find in his poem certain controversial allusions to the doctrine of Anaximenes and the Pythagoreans (fragment B 8, verse 24, and frag. B 4), and also against Heraclitus (frag .B 6, vv.8–9), while Empedocles and Anaxagoras frequently refer to Parmenides.

The reference to Heraclitus has been debated. Bernays&#x27;s thesis that Parmenides attacks Heraclitus, to which Diels, Kranz, Gomperz, Burnet and others adhered, was discussed by Reinhardt, whom Jaeger followed.

Guthrie finds it surprising that Heraclitus would not have censured Parmenides if he had known him, as he did with Xenophanes and Pythagoras. His conclusion, however, does not arise from this consideration, but points out that, due to the importance of his thought, Parmenides splits the history of pre-Socratic philosophy in two; therefore his position with respect to other thinkers is easy to determine. From this point of view, the philosophy of Heraclitus seems to him pre-Parmenidean, while those of Empedocles, Anaxagoras and Democritus are post-Parmenidean.

=== Anecdotes ===
Plutarch, Strabo and Diogenes—following the testimony of Speusippus—agree that Parmenides participated in the government of his city, organizing it and giving it a code of admirable laws.
====Archaeological discovery====
In 1969, the plinth of a statue dated to the 1st century AD was excavated in Velia. On the plinth were four words: ΠΑ[Ρ]ΜΕΝΕΙΔΗΣ ΠΥΡΗΤΟΣ ΟΥΛΙΑΔΗΣ ΦΥΣΙΚΟΣ. The first two clearly read &quot;Parmenides, son of Pires.&quot; The fourth word φυσικός (&quot;fysikós&quot;, &quot;physicist&quot;) was commonly used to designate philosophers who devoted themselves to the observation of nature. On the other hand, there is no agreement on the meaning of the third (οὐλιάδης, &quot;ouliadēs&quot;): it can simply mean &quot;a native of Elea&quot; (the name &quot;Velia&quot; is in Greek Οὐέλια), or &quot;belonging to the Οὐλιος&quot; (&quot;Ulios&quot;), that is, to a medical school (the patron of which was Apollo Ulius). If this last hypothesis were true, then Parmenides would be, in addition to being a legislator, a doctor. The hypothesis is reinforced by the ideas contained in fragment 18 of his poem, which contains anatomical and physiological observations. However, other specialists believe that the only certainty we can extract from the discovery is that of the social importance of Parmenides in the life of his city, already indicated by the testimonies that indicate his activity as a legislator.

==== Visit to Athens ====
Plato, in his dialogue &quot;Parmenides&quot;, relates that, accompanied by his disciple Zeno of Elea, Parmenides visited Athens when he was approximately sixty-five years old and that, on that occasion, Socrates, then a young man, conversed with him. Athenaeus of Naucratis had noted that, although the ages make a dialogue between Parmenides and Socrates hardly possible, the fact that Parmenides has sustained arguments similar to those sustained in the Platonic dialogue is something that seems impossible. Most modern classicists consider the visit to Athens and the meeting and conversation with Socrates to be fictitious. Allusions to this visit in other Platonic works are only references to the same fictitious dialogue and not to a historical fact.

== &quot;On Nature&quot; ==
Parmenides&#x27;s sole work, which has only survived in fragments, is a poem in dactylic hexameter, later titled &quot;On Nature&quot;. Approximately 160 verses remain today from an original total that was probably near 800. The poem was originally divided into three parts: an introductory that contains an allegorical narrative which explains the purpose of the work, a former section known as &quot;The Way of Truth&quot; (&quot;aletheia&quot;, ἀλήθεια), and a latter section known as &quot;The Way of Appearance/Opinion&quot; (&quot;doxa&quot;, δόξα). Despite the poem&#x27;s fragmentary nature, the general plan of both the proem and the first part, &quot;The Way of Truth&quot; have been ascertained by modern scholars, thanks to large excerpts made by Sextus Empiricus and Simplicius of Cilicia. Unfortunately, the second part, &quot;The Way of Opinion&quot;, which is supposed to have been much longer than the first, only survives in small fragments and prose paraphrases.

=== Introduction ===
The introductory poem describes the narrator&#x27;s journey to receive a revelation from an unnamed goddess on the nature of reality. The remainder of the work is then presented as the spoken revelation of the goddess without any accompanying narrative.

The narrative of the poet&#x27;s journey includes a variety of allegorical symbols, such as a speeding chariot with glowing axles, horses, the House of Night, Gates of the paths of Night and Day, and maidens who are &quot;the daughters of the Sun&quot; who escort the poet from the ordinary daytime world to a strange destination, outside our human paths. The allegorical themes in the poem have attracted a variety of different interpretations, including comparisons to Homer and Hesiod, and attempts to relate the journey towards either illumination or darkness, but there is little scholarly consensus about any interpretation, and the surviving evidence from the poem itself, as well as any other literary use of allegory from the same time period, may be too sparse to ever determine any of the intended symbolism with certainty.

=== &quot;The Way of Truth&quot; ===
In the &quot;Way of Truth&quot;, an estimated 90% of which has survived, Parmenides distinguishes between the unity of nature and its variety, insisting in the &quot;Way of Truth&quot; upon the reality of its unity, which is therefore the object of knowledge, and upon the unreality of its variety, which is therefore the object, not of knowledge, but of opinion. This contrasts with the argument in the section called &quot;the way of opinion&quot;, which discusses that which is illusory.

=== &quot;The Way of Opinion&quot; ===
In the significantly longer, but far worse preserved latter section of the poem, &quot;Way of Opinion&quot;, Parmenides propounds a theory of the world of seeming and its development, pointing out, however, that, in accordance with the principles already laid down, these cosmological speculations do not pretend to anything more than mere appearance. The structure of the cosmos is a fundamental binary principle that governs the manifestations of all the particulars: &quot;the Aether fire of flame&quot; (B 8.56), which is gentle, mild, soft, thin and clear, and self-identical, and the other is &quot;ignorant night&quot;, body thick and heavy. Cosmology originally comprised the greater part of his poem, explaining the world&#x27;s origins and operations. Some idea of the sphericity of the Earth also seems to have been known to Parmenides.

== Legacy ==
As the first of the Eleatics, Parmenides is generally credited with being the philosopher who first defined ontology as a separate discipline distinct from theology. His most important pupil was Zeno, who appears alongside him in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Parmenides&quot; where they debate dialectic with Socrates. The pluralist theories of Empedocles and Anaxagoras and the atomist Leucippus, and Democritus have also been seen as a potential response to Parmenides&#x27;s arguments and conclusions. Parmenides is also mentioned in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Sophist&quot; and &quot;Theaetetus.&quot; Later Hellenistic doxographers also considered Parmenides to have been a pupil of Xenophanes. Eusebius of Caesarea, quoting Aristocles of Messene, says that Parmenides was part of a line of skeptical philosophy that culminated in Pyrrhonism for he, by the root, rejects the validity of perception through the senses whilst, at any rate, it is first through our five forms of senses that we become aware of things and then by faculty of reasoning. Parmenides&#x27;s proto-monism of the One also influenced Plotinus and Neoplatonism.

<doc id="23576" wikidata="Q201701" url="?curid=23576" title="Tetraodontidae">
<text>Tetraodontidae is a family of marine and freshwater fish in the order Tetraodontiformes. The family includes many familiar species variously called pufferfish, puffers, balloonfish, blowfish, blowers, blowies, bubblefish, globefish, swellfish, toadfish, toadies, toadle, honey toads, sugar toads, and sea squab. They are morphologically similar to the closely related porcupinefish, which have large external spines (unlike the thinner, hidden spines of the Tetraodontidae, which are only visible when the fish have puffed up).

The majority of pufferfish species are toxic, with some among the most poisonous vertebrates in the world. In certain species, the internal organs, such as the liver, and sometimes the skin, contain tetrodotoxin, and are highly toxic to most animals when eaten; nevertheless, the meat of some species is considered a delicacy in Japan (as 河豚, pronounced &quot;fugu&quot;), Korea (as 복, &quot;bok&quot;, or 복어, &quot;bogeo&quot;), and China (as 河豚, &quot;hétún&quot;) when prepared by specially trained chefs who know which part is safe to eat and in what quantity. Other pufferfish species with nontoxic flesh, such as the northern puffer, &quot;Sphoeroides maculatus&quot;, of Chesapeake Bay, are considered a delicacy elsewhere.

The species &quot;Torquigener albomaculosus&quot; was described by David Attenborough as &quot;the greatest artist of the animal kingdom&quot; due to the males&#x27; unique habit of wooing females by creating nests in sand composed of complex geometric designs.

== Taxonomy ==
The family name comes from the name of its type genus &quot;Tetraodon&quot;; it is traced from the Greek words &quot;tetra&quot; meaning &quot;four&quot; and &quot;odoús&quot; meaning &quot;teeth&quot;.

== Genera ==
The Tetraodontidae contains 193 to 206 species of puffers in 27 or 28 genera:

* &quot;Amblyrhynchotes&quot; 
* &quot;Arothron&quot; 
* &quot;Auriglobus&quot; 
* &quot;Canthigaster&quot; 
* &quot;Carinotetraodon&quot; 
* &quot;Chelonodon&quot; 
* &quot;Chonerhinos&quot; 
* &quot;Colomesus&quot; 
* &quot;Contusus&quot; 
* &quot;Dichotomyctere&quot; 
* &quot;Ephippion&quot; 
* &quot;Feroxodon&quot; 
* &quot;Guentheridia&quot; 
* &quot;Javichthys&quot; 
* &quot;Leiodon&quot; 
* &quot;Lagocephalus&quot; 
* &quot;Marilyna&quot; 
* &quot;Omegophora&quot;

* &quot;Tetractenos&quot; 
* &quot;Tetraodon&quot; 
* &quot;Torquigener&quot; 
* &quot;Tylerius&quot; 


=== Fossil genera ===

The following fossil genera are known:

* †&quot;Archaeotetraodon&quot; 
* †&quot;Eotetraodon&quot; 
* †&quot;Leithaodon&quot; 

== Morphology ==
Pufferfish are typically small to medium in size, although a few species such as the Mbu pufferfish can reach lengths greater than .

Tetraodontiformes, or pufferfish, are most significantly characterized by the beak-like four teeth – hence the name combining the Greek terms &quot;tetra&quot; for four and &quot;odous&quot; for tooth. Each of the top and bottom arches is fused together with a visible midsagittal demarcation, which are used to break apart and consume small crustaceans. The lack of ribs, a pelvis, and pelvic fins are also unique to pufferfish. The notably missing bone and fin features are due to the pufferfish&#x27; specialized defense mechanism, expanding by sucking in water through an oral cavity.

Pufferfish can also have many varied structures of caltrop-like dermal spines, which account for the replacement of typical fish scales, and can range in coverage extent from the entire body, to leaving the frontal surface empty. Tetraodontidae typically have smaller spines than the sister family Diodontidae, with some spines not being visible until inflation.

== Distribution ==
They are most diverse in the tropics, relatively uncommon in the temperate zone, and completely absent from cold waters.

== Ecology and life history ==
Most pufferfish species live in marine or brackish waters, but several tropical genera, comprising about 35 species, spend their entire lifecycles in fresh water. These freshwater species are found in disjunct tropical regions of South America (&quot;Colomesus asellus&quot; and &quot;Colomesus tocantinensis&quot;), Africa (six &quot;Tetraodon&quot; species), and Southeast Asia (&quot;Auriglobus&quot;, &quot;Carinotetraodon&quot;, &quot;Dichotomyctere&quot;, &quot;Leiodon&quot; and &quot;Pao&quot;).

=== Natural defenses ===
The puffer&#x27;s unique and distinctive natural defenses help compensate for its slow locomotion. It moves by combining pectoral, dorsal, anal, and caudal fin motions. This makes it highly maneuverable, but very slow, so a comparatively easy predation target. Its tail fin is mainly used as a rudder, but it can be used for a sudden evasive burst of speed that shows none of the care and precision of its usual movements. The puffer&#x27;s excellent eyesight, combined with this speed burst, is the first and most important defense against predators.

The pufferfish&#x27;s secondary defense mechanism, used if successfully pursued, is to fill its extremely elastic stomach with water (or air when outside the water) until it is much larger and almost spherical in shape. Even if they are not visible when the puffer is not inflated, all puffers have pointed spines, so a hungry predator may suddenly find itself facing an unpalatable, pointy ball rather than a slow, easy meal. Predators that do not heed this warning (or are &quot;lucky&quot; enough to catch the puffer suddenly, before or during inflation) may die from choking, and predators that do manage to swallow the puffer may find their stomachs full of tetrodotoxin (TTX), making puffers an unpleasant, possibly lethal, choice of prey. This neurotoxin is found primarily in the ovaries and liver, although smaller amounts exist in the intestines and skin, as well as trace amounts in muscle. It does not always have a lethal effect on large predators, such as sharks, but it can kill humans.

Larval pufferfish are chemically defended by the presence of TTX on the surface of skin, which causes predators to spit them out.

Not all puffers are necessarily poisonous; the flesh of the northern puffer is not toxic (a level of poison can be found in its viscera) and it is considered a delicacy in North America. Toxin level varies widely even in fish that are poisonous. A puffer&#x27;s neurotoxin is not necessarily as toxic to other animals as it is to humans, and puffers are eaten routinely by some species of fish, such as lizardfish and sharks.

Puffers are able to move their eyes independently, and many species can change the color or intensity of their patterns in response to environmental changes. In these respects, they are somewhat similar to the terrestrial chameleon. Although most puffers are drab, many have bright colors and distinctive markings, and make no attempt to hide from predators. This is likely an example of honestly signaled aposematism.

Dolphins have been filmed expertly handling pufferfish amongst themselves in an apparent attempt to get intoxicated or enter a trance-like state.

=== Reproduction ===
Many marine puffers have a pelagic, or open-ocean, life stage. Spawning occurs after males slowly push females to the water surface or join females already present. The eggs are spherical and buoyant. Hatching occurs after roughly four days. The fry are tiny, but under magnification have a shape usually reminiscent of a pufferfish. They have a functional mouth and eyes, and must eat within a few days. Brackish-water puffers may breed in bays in a manner similar to marine species, or may breed more similarly to the freshwater species, in cases where they have moved far enough upriver.

Reproduction in freshwater species varies quite a bit. The dwarf puffers court with males following females, possibly displaying the crests and keels unique to this subgroup of species. After the female accepts his advances, she will lead the male into plants or another form of cover, where she can release eggs for fertilization. The male may help her by rubbing against her side. This has been observed in captivity, and they are the only commonly captive-spawned puffer species.

Target-group puffers have also been spawned in aquaria, and follow a similar courting behavior, minus the crest/keel display. Eggs are laid, though, on a flat piece of slate or other smooth, hard material, to which they adhere. The male will guard them until they hatch, carefully blowing water over them regularly to keep the eggs healthy. His parenting is finished when the young hatch and the fry are on their own.

In 2012, males of the species &quot;Torquigener albomaculosus&quot; were documented while carving large and complex geometric, circular structures in the seabed sand in Amami Ōshima, Japan. The structures serve to attract females and to provide a safe place for them to lay their eggs.

Information on breeding of specific species is very limited. &quot;T. nigroviridis&quot;, the green-spotted puffer, has recently been spawned artificially under captive conditions. It is believed to spawn in bays in a similar manner to saltwater species, as their sperm was found to be motile only at full marine salinities, but wild breeding has never been observed. &quot;Xenopterus naritus&quot; has been reported to be the first bred artificially in Sarawak, Northwestern Borneo, in June 2016, and the main purpose was for development of aquaculture of the species.

=== Diet ===
Pufferfish diets can vary depending on their environment. Traditionally, their diet consists mostly of algae and small invertebrates. They can survive on a completely vegetarian diet if their environment is lacking resources, but prefer an omnivorous food selection. Larger species of pufferfish are able to use their beak-like front teeth to break open clams, mussels, and other shellfish. Some species of pufferfish have also been known to enact various hunting techniques ranging from ambush to open-water hunting.

== Evolution ==
The tetraodontids have been estimated to have diverged from diodontids between 89 and 138 million years ago. The four major clades diverged during the Cretaceous between 80 and 101 million years ago. The oldest known pufferfish genus is &quot;Eotetraodon&quot;, from the Lutetian epoch of Middle Eocene Europe, with fossils found in Monte Bolca and the Caucasus Mountains. The Monte Bolca species, &quot;E. pygmaeus&quot;, coexisted with several other tetraodontiforms, including an extinct species of diodontid, primitive boxfish (&quot;Proaracana&quot; and &quot;Eolactoria&quot;), and other, totally extinct forms, such as &quot;Zignoichthys&quot; and the spinacanthids. The extinct genus, &quot;Archaeotetraodon&quot; is known from Miocene-aged fossils from Europe.

== Poisoning ==
Pufferfish can be lethal if not served properly. Puffer poisoning usually results from consumption of incorrectly prepared puffer soup, &quot;fugu chiri&quot;, or occasionally from raw puffer meat, &quot;sashimi fugu&quot;. While &quot;chiri&quot; is much more likely to cause death, &quot;sashimi fugu&quot; often causes intoxication, light-headedness, and numbness of the lips. Pufferfish tetrodotoxin deadens the tongue and lips, and induces dizziness and vomiting, followed by numbness and prickling over the body, rapid heart rate, decreased blood pressure, and muscle paralysis. The toxin paralyzes the diaphragm muscle and stops the person who has ingested it from breathing. People who live longer than 24 hours typically survive, although possibly after a coma lasting several days.

The source of tetrodotoxin in puffers has been a matter of debate, but it is increasingly accepted that bacteria in the fish&#x27;s intestinal tract are the source.

Saxitoxin, the cause of paralytic shellfish poisoning and red tide, can also be found in certain puffers.

=== Philippines ===
In September 2012, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in the Philippines issued a warning not to eat puffer fish, after local fishermen died upon consuming puffer fish for dinner. The warning indicated that puffer fish toxin is 100 times more potent than cyanide.

=== Thailand ===

Pufferfish, called &quot;pakapao&quot; in Thailand, are usually consumed by mistake. They are often cheaper than other fish, and because they contain inconsistent levels of toxins between fish and season, there is little awareness or monitoring of the danger. Consumers are regularly hospitalized and some even die from the poisoning.

=== United States ===

Cases of neurological symptoms, including numbness and tingling of the lips and mouth, have been reported to rise after the consumption of puffers caught in the area of Titusville, Florida, US. The symptoms generally resolve within hours to days, although one affected individual required intubation for 72 hours. As a result, Florida banned the harvesting of puffers from certain bodies of water.

===Treatment ===
Treatment is mainly supportive and consists of intestinal decontamination with gastric lavage and activated charcoal, and life-support until the toxin is metabolized. Case reports suggest anticholinesterases such as edrophonium may be effective.

<text>In mathematics, a partial function from a set to a set is a function from a subset of (possibly the whole itself) to . The subset , that is, the &quot;domain&quot; of viewed as a function, is called the domain of definition or natural domain of . If equals , that is, if is defined on every element in , then is said to be a total function.

In other words, a partial function is a binary relation over two sets that associates to every element of the first set &quot;at most&quot; one element of the second set; it is thus a univalent relation. This generalizes the concept of a (total) function by not requiring &quot;every&quot; element of the first set to be associated to an element of the second set.

A partial function is often used when its exact domain of definition is not known, or is difficult to specify. However, even when the exact domain of definition is known, partial functions are often used for simplicity or brevity. This is the case in calculus, where, for example, the quotient of two functions is a partial function whose domain of definition cannot contain the zeros of the denominator; in this context, a partial function is generally simply called a .

In computability theory, a general recursive function is a partial function from the integers to the integers; no algorithm can exist for deciding whether an arbitrary such function is in fact total.

When arrow notation is used for functions, a partial function formula_1 from formula_2 to formula_3 is sometimes written as formula_4 formula_5 or formula_6 However, there is no general convention, and the latter notation is more commonly used for inclusion maps or embeddings.

Specifically, for a partial function formula_4 and any formula_8 one has either:
* formula_9 (it is a single element in ), or
* formula_10 is undefined.

For example, if formula_1 is the square root function restricted to the integers
: formula_12 defined by:
: formula_13 if, and only if, formula_14 formula_15
then formula_16 is only defined if formula_17 is a perfect square (that is, formula_18). So formula_19 but formula_20 is undefined.

== Basic concepts ==
A partial function arises from the consideration of maps between two sets and that may not be defined on the entire set . A common example is the square root operation on the real numbers formula_21: because negative real numbers do not have real square roots, the operation can be viewed as a partial function from formula_21 to formula_23 The &quot;domain of definition&quot; of a partial function is the subset of on which the partial function is defined; in this case, the partial function may also be viewed as a function from to . In the example of the square root operation, the set consists of the nonnegative real numbers formula_24

The notion of partial function is particularly convenient when the exact domain of definition is unknown or even unknowable. For a computer-science example of the latter, see &quot;Halting problem&quot;.

In case the domain of definition is equal to the whole set , the partial function is said to be &quot;total&quot;. Thus, total partial functions from to coincide with functions from to .

Many properties of functions can be extended in an appropriate sense of partial functions. A partial function is said to be injective, surjective, or bijective when the function given by the restriction of the partial function to its domain of definition is injective, surjective, bijective respectively.

Because a function is trivially surjective when restricted to its image, the term partial bijection denotes a partial function which is injective.

An injective partial function may be inverted to an injective partial function, and a partial function which is both injective and surjective has an injective function as inverse. Furthermore, a function which is injective may be inverted to a bijective partial function.

The notion of transformation can be generalized to partial functions as well. A partial transformation is a function formula_25 where both formula_26 and formula_27 are subsets of some set formula_28

== Function spaces ==

For convenience, denote the set of all partial functions formula_29 from a set formula_2 to a set formula_3 by formula_32 This set is the union of the sets of functions defined on subsets of formula_2 with same codomain formula_3:
: formula_35
the latter also written as formula_36 In finite case, its cardinality is
: formula_37
because any partial function can be extended to a function by any fixed value formula_38 not contained in formula_39 so that the codomain is formula_40 an operation which is injective (unique and invertible by restriction).

== Discussion and examples ==
The first diagram at the top of the article represents a partial function that is a function since the element 1 in the left-hand set is not associated with anything in the right-hand set. Whereas, the second diagram represents a function since every element on the left-hand set is associated with exactly one element in the right hand set.

=== Natural logarithm ===

Consider the natural logarithm function mapping the real numbers to themselves. The logarithm of a non-positive real is not a real number, so the natural logarithm function doesn&#x27;t associate any real number in the codomain with any non-positive real number in the domain. Therefore, the natural logarithm function is not a function when viewed as a function from the reals to themselves, but it is a partial function. If the domain is restricted to only include the positive reals (that is, if the natural logarithm function is viewed as a function from the positive reals to the reals), then the natural logarithm is a function.

=== Subtraction of natural numbers ===

Subtraction of natural numbers (in which formula_41 is the non-negative integers) is a partial function:
: formula_42
: formula_43

It is defined only when formula_44

=== Bottom element ===

In denotational semantics a partial function is considered as returning the bottom element when it is undefined.

In computer science a partial function corresponds to a subroutine that raises an exception or loops forever. The IEEE floating point standard defines a not-a-number value which is returned when a floating point operation is undefined and exceptions are suppressed, e.g. when the square root of a negative number is requested.

In a programming language where function parameters are statically typed, a function may be defined as a partial function because the language&#x27;s type system cannot express the exact domain of the function, so the programmer instead gives it the smallest domain which is expressible as a type and contains the domain of definition of the function.

=== In category theory ===

In category theory, when considering the operation of morphism composition in concrete categories, the composition operation formula_45 is a total function if and only if formula_46 has one element. The reason for this is that two morphisms formula_47 and formula_48 can only be composed as formula_49 if formula_50 that is, the codomain of formula_1 must equal the domain of formula_52

The category of sets and partial functions is equivalent to but not isomorphic with the category of pointed sets and point-preserving maps. One textbook notes that &quot;This formal completion of sets and partial maps by adding “improper,” “infinite” elements was reinvented many times, in particular, in topology (one-point compactification) and in theoretical computer science.&quot;

The category of sets and partial bijections is equivalent to its dual. It is the prototypical inverse category.

=== In abstract algebra ===

Partial algebra generalizes the notion of universal algebra to partial operations. An example would be a field, in which the multiplicative inversion is the only proper partial operation (because division by zero is not defined).

The set of all partial functions (partial transformations) on a given base set, formula_53 forms a regular semigroup called the semigroup of all partial transformations (or the partial transformation semigroup on formula_2), typically denoted by formula_55 The set of all partial bijections on formula_2 forms the symmetric inverse semigroup.

=== Charts and atlases for manifolds and fiber bundles ===

Charts in the atlases which specify the structure of manifolds and fiber bundles are partial functions. In the case of manifolds, the domain is the point set of the manifold. In the case of fiber bundles, the domain is the space of the fiber bundle. In these applications, the most important construction is the transition map, which is the composite of one chart with the inverse of another. The initial classification of manifolds and fiber bundles is largely expressed in terms of constraints on these transition maps.

The reason for the use of partial functions instead of functions is to permit general global topologies to be represented by stitching together local patches to describe the global structure. The &quot;patches&quot; are the domains where the charts are defined.

<text>The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from a material caused by electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light. Electrons emitted in this manner are called photoelectrons. The phenomenon is studied in condensed matter physics, solid state, and quantum chemistry to draw inferences about the properties of atoms, molecules and solids. The effect has found use in electronic devices specialized for light detection and precisely timed electron emission.

The experimental results disagree with classical electromagnetism, which predicts that continuous light waves transfer energy to electrons, which would then be emitted when they accumulate enough energy. An alteration in the intensity of light would theoretically change the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, with sufficiently dim light resulting in a delayed emission. The experimental results instead show that electrons are dislodged only when the light exceeds a certain frequency—regardless of the light&#x27;s intensity or duration of exposure. Because a low-frequency beam at a high intensity does not build up the energy required to produce photoelectrons, as would be the case if light&#x27;s energy accumulated over time from a continuous wave, Albert Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but a swarm of discrete energy packets, known as photons—a term coined by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926.

Emission of conduction electrons from typical metals requires a few electron-volt (eV) light quanta, corresponding to short-wavelength visible or ultraviolet light. In extreme cases, emissions are induced with photons approaching zero energy, like in systems with negative electron affinity and the emission from excited states, or a few hundred keV photons for core electrons in elements with a high atomic number. Study of the photoelectric effect led to important steps in understanding the quantum nature of light and electrons and influenced the formation of the concept of wave–particle duality. Other phenomena where light affects the movement of electric charges include the photoconductive effect, the photovoltaic effect, and the photoelectrochemical effect.

==Emission mechanism==
The photons of a light beam have a characteristic energy, called photon energy, which is proportional to the frequency of the light. In the photoemission process, when an electron within some material absorbs the energy of a photon and acquires more energy than its binding energy, it is likely to be ejected. If the photon energy is too low, the electron is unable to escape the material. Since an increase in the intensity of low-frequency light will only increase the number of low-energy photons, this change in intensity will not create any single photon with enough energy to dislodge an electron. Moreover, the energy of the emitted electrons will not depend on the intensity of the incoming light of a given frequency, but only on the energy of the individual photons.

While free electrons can absorb any energy when irradiated as long as this is followed by an immediate re-emission, like in the Compton effect, in quantum systems all of the energy from one photon is absorbed—if the process is allowed by quantum mechanics—or none at all. Part of the acquired energy is used to liberate the electron from its atomic binding, and the rest contributes to the electron&#x27;s kinetic energy as a free particle. Because electrons in a material occupy many different quantum states with different binding energies, and because they can sustain energy losses on their way out of the material, the emitted electrons will have a range of kinetic energies. The electrons from the highest occupied states will have the highest kinetic energy. In metals, those electrons will be emitted from the Fermi level.

When the photoelectron is emitted into a solid rather than into a vacuum, the term &quot;internal photoemission&quot; is often used, and emission into a vacuum is distinguished as &quot;external photoemission&quot;.

===Experimental observation of photoelectric emission===
Even though photoemission can occur from any material, it is most readily observed from metals and other conductors. This is because the process produces a charge imbalance which, if not neutralized by current flow, results in the increasing potential barrier until the emission completely ceases. The energy barrier to photoemission is usually increased by nonconductive oxide layers on metal surfaces, so most practical experiments and devices based on the photoelectric effect use clean metal surfaces in evacuated tubes. Vacuum also helps observing the electrons since it prevents gases from impeding their flow between the electrodes.

Sunlight is an inconsistent and variable source of ultraviolet light. Cloud cover, ozone concentration, altitude, and surface reflection all alter the amount of UV. Laboratory sources of UV are based on xenon arc lamps or, for more uniform but weaker light, fluorescent lamps.
More specialized sources include ultraviolet lasers and synchrotron radiation.
The classical setup to observe the photoelectric effect includes a light source, a set of filters to monochromatize the light, a vacuum tube transparent to ultraviolet light, an emitting electrode (E) exposed to the light, and a collector (C) whose voltage &quot;V&quot;C can be externally controlled.

A positive external voltage is used to direct the photoemitted electrons onto the collector. If the frequency and the intensity of the incident radiation are fixed, the photoelectric current &quot;I&quot; increases with an increase in the positive voltage, as more and more electrons are directed onto the electrode. When no additional photoelectrons can be collected, the photoelectric current attains a saturation value. This current can only increase with the increase of the intensity of light.

An increasing negative voltage prevents all but the highest-energy electrons from reaching the collector. When no current is observed through the tube, the negative voltage has reached the value that is high enough to slow down and stop the most energetic photoelectrons of kinetic energy &quot;K&quot;max. This value of the retarding voltage is called the &quot;stopping potential&quot; or &quot;cut off&quot; potential &quot;V&quot;o. Since the work done by the retarding potential in stopping the electron of charge &quot;e&quot; is &quot;eV&quot;o, the following must hold &quot;eV&quot;o = &quot;K&quot;max.

The current-voltage curve is sigmoidal, but its exact shape depends on the experimental geometry and the electrode material properties.

For a given metal surface, there exists a certain minimum frequency of incident radiation below which no photoelectrons are emitted. This frequency is called the &quot;threshold frequency&quot;. Increasing the frequency of the incident beam increases the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons, and the stopping voltage has to increase. The number of emitted electrons may also change because the probability that each photon results in an emitted electron is a function of photon energy.

An increase in the intensity of the same monochromatic light (so long as the intensity is not too high), which is proportional to the number of photons impinging on the surface in a given time, increases the rate at which electrons are ejected—the photoelectric current &quot;I—&quot;but the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons and the stopping voltage remain the same. For a given metal and frequency of incident radiation, the rate at which photoelectrons are ejected is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light.

The time lag between the incidence of radiation and the emission of a photoelectron is very small, less than 10−9 second. Angular distribution of the photoelectrons is highly dependent on polarization (the direction of the electric field) of the incident light, as well as the emitting material&#x27;s quantum properties such as atomic and molecular orbital symmetries and the electronic band structure of crystalline solids. In materials without macroscopic order, the distribution of electrons tends to peak in the direction of polarization of linearly polarized light. The experimental technique that can measure these distributions to infer the material&#x27;s properties is angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

===Theoretical explanation===
In 1905, Einstein proposed a theory of the photoelectric effect using a concept that light consists of tiny packets of energy known as photons or light quanta. Each packet carries energy formula_1 that is proportional to the frequency formula_2 of the corresponding electromagnetic wave. The proportionality constant formula_3 has become known as the Planck constant. In the range of kinetic energies of the electrons that are removed from their varying atomic bindings by the absorption of a photon of energy formula_1, the highest kinetic energy formula_5 is
formula_6
Here, formula_7 is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface of the material. It is called the work function of the surface and is sometimes denoted formula_8 or formula_9. If the work function is written as
formula_10
the formula for the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons becomes
formula_11

Kinetic energy is positive, and formula_12 is required for the photoelectric effect to occur. The frequency formula_13 is the threshold frequency for the given material. Above that frequency, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons as well as the stopping voltage in the experiment formula_14 rise linearly with the frequency, and have no dependence on the number of photons and the intensity of the impinging monochromatic light. Einstein&#x27;s formula, however simple, explained all the phenomenology of the photoelectric effect, and had far-reaching consequences in the development of quantum mechanics.

=== Photoemission from atoms, molecules and solids ===
Electrons that are bound in atoms, molecules and solids each occupy distinct states of well-defined binding energies. When light quanta deliver more than this amount of energy to an individual electron, the electron may be emitted into free space with excess (kinetic) energy that is formula_1 higher than the electron&#x27;s binding energy. The distribution of kinetic energies thus reflects the distribution of the binding energies of the electrons in the atomic, molecular or crystalline system: an electron emitted from the state at binding energy formula_16 is found at kinetic energy formula_17. This distribution is one of the main characteristics of the quantum system, and can be used for further studies in quantum chemistry and quantum physics.

====Models of photoemission from solids====
The electronic properties of ordered, crystalline solids are determined by the distribution of the electronic states with respect to energy and momentum—the electronic band structure of the solid. Theoretical models of photoemission from solids show that this distribution is, for the most part, preserved in the photoelectric effect. The phenomenological &quot;three-step model&quot; for ultraviolet and soft X-ray excitation decomposes the effect into these steps:

# Inner photoelectric effect in the bulk of the material that is a direct optical transition between an occupied and an unoccupied electronic state. This effect is subject to quantum-mechanical selection rules for dipole transitions. The hole left behind the electron can give rise to secondary electron emission, or the so-called Auger effect, which may be visible even when the primary photoelectron does not leave the material. In molecular solids phonons are excited in this step and may be visible as satellite lines in the final electron energy.
# Electron propagation to the surface in which some electrons may be scattered because of interactions with other constituents of the solid. Electrons that originate deeper in the solid are much more likely to suffer collisions and emerge with altered energy and momentum. Their mean-free path is a universal curve dependent on electron&#x27;s energy.
# Electron escape through the surface barrier into free-electron-like states of the vacuum. In this step the electron loses energy in the amount of the &quot;work function of the surface&quot;, and suffers from the momentum loss in the direction perpendicular to the surface. Because the binding energy of electrons in solids is conveniently expressed with respect to the highest occupied state at the Fermi energy formula_18, and the difference to the free-space (vacuum) energy is the work function of the surface, the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from solids is usually written as formula_19.

There are cases where the three-step model fails to explain peculiarities of the photoelectron intensity distributions. The more elaborate &quot;one-step model&quot; treats the effect as a coherent process of photoexcitation into the final state of a finite crystal for which the wave function is free-electron-like outside of the crystal, but has a decaying envelope inside.

==History==
===19th century===
In 1839, Alexandre Edmond Becquerel discovered the related photovoltaic effect while studying the effect of light on electrolytic cells. Though not equivalent to the photoelectric effect, his work on photovoltaics was instrumental in showing a strong relationship between light and electronic properties of materials. In 1873, Willoughby Smith discovered photoconductivity in selenium while testing the metal for its high resistance properties in conjunction with his work involving submarine telegraph cables.

Johann Elster (1854–1920) and Hans Geitel (1855–1923), students in Heidelberg, investigated the effects produced by light on electrified bodies and developed the first practical photoelectric cells that could be used to measure the intensity of light. They arranged metals with respect to their power of discharging negative electricity: rubidium, potassium, alloy of potassium and sodium, sodium, lithium, magnesium, thallium and zinc; for copper, platinum, lead, iron, cadmium, carbon, and mercury the effects with ordinary light were too small to be measurable. The order of the metals for this effect was the same as in Volta&#x27;s series for contact-electricity, the most electropositive metals giving the largest photo-electric effect.

In 1887, Heinrich Hertz observed the photoelectric effect and reported on the production and reception of electromagnetic waves. The receiver in his apparatus consisted of a coil with a spark gap, where a spark would be seen upon detection of electromagnetic waves. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better. However, he noticed that the maximum spark length was reduced when inside the box. A glass panel placed between the source of electromagnetic waves and the receiver absorbed ultraviolet radiation that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he replaced the glass with quartz, as quartz does not absorb UV radiation.

The discoveries by Hertz led to a series of investigations by Wilhelm Hallwachs, Hoor, Augusto Righi and Aleksander Stoletov on the effect of light, and especially of ultraviolet light, on charged bodies. Hallwachs connected a zinc plate to an electroscope. He allowed ultraviolet light to fall on a freshly cleaned zinc plate and observed that the zinc plate became uncharged if initially negatively charged, positively charged if initially uncharged, and more positively charged if initially positively charged. From these observations he concluded that some negatively charged particles were emitted by the zinc plate when exposed to ultraviolet light. 

With regard to the &quot;Hertz effect&quot;, the researchers from the start showed the complexity of the phenomenon of photoelectric fatigue—the progressive diminution of the effect observed upon fresh metallic surfaces. According to Hallwachs, ozone played an important part in the phenomenon, and the emission was influenced by oxidation, humidity, and the degree of polishing of the surface. It was at the time unclear whether fatigue is absent in a vacuum.

In the period from 1888 until 1891, a detailed analysis of the photoeffect was performed by Aleksandr Stoletov with results reported in six publications. Stoletov invented a new experimental setup which was more suitable for a quantitative analysis of the photoeffect. He discovered a direct proportionality between the intensity of light and the induced photoelectric current (the first law of photoeffect or Stoletov&#x27;s law). He measured the dependence of the intensity of the photo electric current on the gas pressure, where he found the existence of an optimal gas pressure corresponding to a maximum photocurrent; this property was used for the creation of solar cells.

Many substances besides metals discharge negative electricity under the action of ultraviolet light. G. C. Schmidt and O. Knoblauch compiled a list of these substances.

In 1897, J. J. Thomson investigated ultraviolet light in Crookes tubes. Thomson deduced that the ejected particles, which he called corpuscles, were of the same nature as cathode rays. These particles later became known as the electrons. Thomson enclosed a metal plate (a cathode) in a vacuum tube, and exposed it to high-frequency radiation. It was thought that the oscillating electromagnetic fields caused the atoms&#x27; field to resonate and, after reaching a certain amplitude, caused subatomic corpuscles to be emitted, and current to be detected. The amount of this current varied with the intensity and color of the radiation. Larger radiation intensity or frequency would produce more current.

During the years 1886–1902, Wilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of photoelectric emission in detail. Lenard observed that a current flows through an evacuated glass tube enclosing two electrodes when ultraviolet radiation falls on one of them. As soon as ultraviolet radiation is stopped, the current also stops. This initiated the concept of photoelectric emission. The discovery of the ionization of gases by ultraviolet light was made by Philipp Lenard in 1900. As the effect was produced across several centimeters of air and yielded a greater number of positive ions than negative, it was natural to interpret the phenomenon, as J. J. Thomson did, as a &quot;Hertz effect&quot; upon the particles present in the gas.

===20th century===
In 1902, Lenard observed that the energy of individual emitted electrons was independent of the applied light intensity. This appeared to be at odds with Maxwell&#x27;s wave theory of light, which predicted that the electron energy would be proportional to the intensity of the radiation.

Lenard observed the variation in electron energy with light frequency using a powerful electric arc lamp which enabled him to investigate large changes in intensity. However, Lenard&#x27;s results were qualitative rather than quantitative because of the difficulty in performing the experiments: the experiments needed to be done on freshly cut metal so that the pure metal was observed, but it oxidized in a matter of minutes even in the partial vacuums he used. The current emitted by the surface was determined by the light&#x27;s intensity, or brightness: doubling the intensity of the light doubled the number of electrons emitted from the surface.

Initial investigation of the photoelectric effect in gasses by Lenard were followed up by J. J. Thomson and then more decisively by Frederic Palmer Jr. The gas photoemission was studied and showed very different characteristics than those at first attributed to it by Lenard.

In 1900, while studying black-body radiation, the German physicist Max Planck suggested in his &quot;On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum&quot; paper that the energy carried by electromagnetic waves could only be released in &quot;packets&quot; of energy. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper advancing the hypothesis that light energy is carried in discrete quantized packets to explain experimental data from the photoelectric effect. Einstein theorized that the energy in each quantum of light was equal to the frequency of light multiplied by a constant, later called the Planck constant. A photon above a threshold frequency has the required energy to eject a single electron, creating the observed effect. This was a step in the development of quantum mechanics. In 1914, Robert A. Millikan&#x27;s highly accurate measurements of the Planck constant from the photoelectric effect supported Einstein&#x27;s model, even though a corpuscular theory of light was for Millikan, at the time, &quot;quite unthinkable&quot;. Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for &quot;his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect&quot;, and Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923 for &quot;his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect&quot;. In quantum perturbation theory of atoms and solids acted upon by electromagnetic radiation, the photoelectric effect is still commonly analyzed in terms of waves; the two approaches are equivalent because photon or wave absorption can only happen between quantized energy levels whose energy difference is that of the energy of photon.

Albert Einstein&#x27;s mathematical description of how the photoelectric effect was caused by absorption of quanta of light was in one of his Annus Mirabilis papers, named &quot;On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light&quot;. The paper proposed a simple description of &quot;energy quanta&quot;, and showed how they explained the blackbody radiation spectrum. His explanation in terms of absorption of discrete quanta of light agreed with experimental results. It explained why the energy of photoelectrons was not dependent on incident light &quot;intensity&quot;. This was a theoretical leap, but the concept was strongly resisted at first because it contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s equations of electromagnetism, and more generally, the assumption of infinite divisibility of energy in physical systems.

Einstein&#x27;s work predicted that the energy of individual ejected electrons increases linearly with the frequency of the light. The precise relationship had not at that time been tested. By 1905 it was known that the energy of photoelectrons increases with increasing &quot;frequency&quot; of incident light and is independent of the &quot;intensity&quot; of the light. However, the manner of the increase was not experimentally determined until 1914 when Millikan showed that Einstein&#x27;s prediction was correct.

The photoelectric effect helped to propel the then-emerging concept of wave–particle duality in the nature of light. Light simultaneously possesses the characteristics of both waves and particles, each being manifested according to the circumstances. The effect was impossible to understand in terms of the classical wave description of light, as the energy of the emitted electrons did not depend on the intensity of the incident radiation. Classical theory predicted that the electrons would &#x27;gather up&#x27; energy over a period of time, and then be emitted.
===21st century===
Research in recent years on the photoelectric effect has been focused on measurements on emission time of photoelectrons. For long, it was believed that photoemission is an instantaneous process. However, a seminal role in this field was played by experimental techniques on attosecond generation of pulses of light for studies on electron dynamics, which was recognised through the 2023 Nobel Prize in physics to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier. For example, in 2010, it was discovered that electron emission takes 20 attoseconds and that photoemission is associated with complex multielectron correlations and is not a single-electron process. In a more recent work in the context of tungsten, measurements on photoelectron emission indicated that around 100 attoseconds are required to liberate an electron. In another research, the value was found to be 45 attoseconds. A broad consensus is emerging towards the fact that photoemisison is not instantaneous and involves finite time.

==Uses and effects==
===Photomultipliers===
These are extremely light-sensitive vacuum tubes with a coated photocathode inside the envelope. The photo cathode contains combinations of materials such as cesium, rubidium, and antimony specially selected to provide a low work function, so when illuminated even by very low levels of light, the photocathode readily releases electrons. By means of a series of electrodes (dynodes) at ever-higher potentials, these electrons are accelerated and substantially increased in number through secondary emission to provide a readily detectable output current. Photomultipliers are still commonly used wherever low levels of light must be detected.

===Image sensors===
Video camera tubes in the early days of television used the photoelectric effect. For example, Philo Farnsworth&#x27;s &quot;Image dissector&quot; used a screen charged by the photoelectric effect to transform an optical image into a scanned electronic signal.

===Photoelectron spectroscopy===
Because the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is exactly the energy of the incident photon minus the energy of the electron&#x27;s binding within an atom, molecule or solid, the binding energy can be determined by shining a monochromatic X-ray or UV light of a known energy and measuring the kinetic energies of the photoelectrons. The distribution of electron energies is valuable for studying quantum properties of these systems. It can also be used to determine the elemental composition of the samples. For solids, the kinetic energy and emission angle distribution of the photoelectrons is measured for the complete determination of the electronic band structure in terms of the allowed binding energies and momenta of the electrons. Modern instruments for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy are capable of measuring these quantities with a precision better than 1 meV and 0.1°.

Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements are usually performed in a high-vacuum environment, because the electrons would be scattered by gas molecules if they were present. However, some companies are now selling products that allow photoemission in air. The light source can be a laser, a discharge tube, or a synchrotron radiation source.

The concentric hemispherical analyzer is a typical electron energy analyzer. It uses an electric field between two hemispheres to change (disperse) the trajectories of incident electrons depending on their kinetic energies.

===Night vision devices===
Photons hitting a thin film of alkali metal or semiconductor material such as gallium arsenide in an image intensifier tube cause the ejection of photoelectrons due to the photoelectric effect. These are accelerated by an electrostatic field where they strike a phosphor coated screen, converting the electrons back into photons. Intensification of the signal is achieved either through acceleration of the electrons or by increasing the number of electrons through secondary emissions, such as with a micro-channel plate. Sometimes a combination of both methods is used. Additional kinetic energy is required to move an electron out of the conduction band and into the vacuum level. This is known as the electron affinity of the photocathode and is another barrier to photoemission other than the forbidden band, explained by the band gap model. Some materials such as gallium arsenide have an effective electron affinity that is below the level of the conduction band. In these materials, electrons that move to the conduction band all have sufficient energy to be emitted from the material, so the film that absorbs photons can be quite thick. These materials are known as negative electron affinity materials.

===Spacecraft===
The photoelectric effect will cause spacecraft exposed to sunlight to develop a positive charge. This can be a major problem, as other parts of the spacecraft are in shadow which will result in the spacecraft developing a negative charge from nearby plasmas. The imbalance can discharge through delicate electrical components. The static charge created by the photoelectric effect is self-limiting, because a higher charged object does not give up its electrons as easily as a lower charged object does.

===Moon dust===
Light from the Sun hitting lunar dust causes it to become positively charged from the photoelectric effect. The charged dust then repels itself and lifts off the surface of the Moon by electrostatic levitation. This manifests itself almost like an &quot;atmosphere of dust&quot;, visible as a thin haze and blurring of distant features, and visible as a dim glow after the sun has set. This was first photographed by the Surveyor program probes in the 1960s, and most recently the Chang&#x27;e 3 rover observed dust deposition on lunar rocks as high as about 28 cm. It is thought that the smallest particles are repelled kilometers from the surface and that the particles move in &quot;fountains&quot; as they charge and discharge.

==Competing processes and photoemission cross section==
When photon energies are as high as the electron rest energy of , yet another process, Compton scattering, may occur. Above twice this energy, at , pair production is also more likely. Compton scattering and pair production are examples of two other competing mechanisms.
Even if the photoelectric effect is the favoured reaction for a particular interaction of a single photon with a bound electron, the result is also subject to quantum statistics and is not guaranteed. The probability of the photoelectric effect occurring is measured by the cross section of the interaction, σ. This has been found to be a function of the atomic number of the target atom and photon energy. In a crude approximation, for photon energies above the highest atomic binding energy, the cross section is given by:

:formula_20

Here &quot;Z&quot; is the atomic number and &quot;n&quot; is a number which varies between 4 and 5. The photoelectric effect rapidly decreases in significance in the gamma-ray region of the spectrum, with increasing photon energy. It is also more likely from elements with high atomic number. Consequently, high-&quot;Z&quot; materials make good gamma-ray shields, which is the principal reason why lead (&quot;Z&quot; = 82) is preferred and most widely used.

<text>The Paleogene Period ( ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period Ma (million years ago) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Ma. It is the first period of the Cenozoic Era, the tenth period of the Phanerozoic and is divided into the Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene epochs. The earlier term Tertiary Period was used to define the time now covered by the Paleogene Period and subsequent Neogene Period; despite no longer being recognized as a formal stratigraphic term, &quot;Tertiary&quot; still sometimes remains in informal use. Paleogene is often abbreviated &quot;Pg&quot;, although the United States Geological Survey uses the abbreviation &quot;&quot; for the Paleogene on the Survey&#x27;s geologic maps. 

Much of the world&#x27;s modern vertebrate diversity originated in a rapid surge of diversification in the early Paleogene, as survivors of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event took advantage of empty ecological niches left behind by the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, marine reptiles, and primitive fish groups. Mammals continued to diversify from relatively small, simple forms into a highly diverse group ranging from small-bodied forms to very large ones, radiating into multiple orders and colonizing the air and marine ecosystems by the Eocene. Birds, the only surviving group of dinosaurs, quickly diversified from the very few neognath and paleognath clades that survived the extinction event, also radiating into multiple orders, colonizing different ecosystems and achieving an extreme level of morphological diversity. Percomorph fish, the most diverse group of vertebrates today, first appeared near the end of the Cretaceous but saw a very rapid radiation into their modern order and family-level diversity during the Paleogene, achieving a diverse array of morphologies. 

The Paleogene is marked by considerable changes in climate from the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, through global cooling during the Eocene to the first appearance of permanent ice sheets in the Antarctic at the beginning of the Oligocene.

== Geology ==

=== Stratigraphy ===
The Paleogene is divided into three series/epochs: the Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene. These stratigraphic units can be defined globally or regionally. For global stratigraphic correlation, the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) ratify global stages based on a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) from a single formation (a stratotype) identifying the lower boundary of the stage.

==== Paleocene ====
The Paleocene is the first series/epoch of the Paleogene and lasted from 66.0 Ma to 56.0 Ma. It is divided into three stages: the Danian 66.0 - 61.6 Ma; Selandian 61.6 - 59.2 Ma; and, Thanetian 59.2 - 56.0 Ma. The GSSP for the base of the Cenozoic, Paleogene and Paleocene is at Oued Djerfane, west of El Kef, Tunisia. It is marked by an iridium anomaly produced by an asteroid impact, and is associated with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The boundary is defined as the rusty colored base of a 50 cm thick clay, which would have been deposited over only a few days. Similar layers are seen in marine and continental deposits worldwide. These layers include the iridium anomaly, microtektites, nickel-rich spinel crystals and shocked quartz, all indicators of a major extraterrestrial impact. The remains of the crater are found at Chicxulub on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. The extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, ammonites and dramatic changes in marine plankton and many other groups of organisms, are also used for correlation purposes.

==== Eocene ====
The Eocene is the second series/epoch of the Paleogene, and lasted from 56.0 Ma to 33.9 Ma. It is divided into four stages: the Ypresian 56.0 Ma to 47.8 Ma; Lutetian 47.8 Ma to 41.2 Ma; Bartonian 41.2 Ma to 37.71 Ma; and, Priabonian 37.71 Ma to 33.9 Ma. The GSSP for the base of the Eocene is at Dababiya, near Luxor, Egypt and is marked by the start of a significant variation in global carbon isotope ratios, produced by a major period of global warming. The change in climate was due to a rapid release of frozen methane clathrates from seafloor sediments at the beginning of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM).

==== Oligocene ====
The Oligocene is the third and youngest series/epoch of the Paleogene, and lasted from 33.9 Ma to 23.03 Ma. It is divided into two stages: the Rupelian 33.9 Ma to 27.82 Ma; and, Chattian 27.82 - 23.03 Ma. The GSSP for the base of the Oligocene is at Massignano, near Ancona, Italy. The extinction the &quot;hantkeninid&quot; planktonic foraminifera is the key marker for the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, which was a time of climate cooling that led to widespread changes in fauna and flora.

== Palaeogeography ==
The final stages of the breakup of Pangaea occurred during the Paleogene as Atlantic Ocean rifting and seafloor spreading extended northwards, separating the North America and Eurasian plates, and Australia and South America rifted from Antarctica, opening the Southern Ocean. Africa and India collided with Eurasia forming the Alpine-Himalayan mountain chains and the western margin of the Pacific plate changed from a divergent to convergent plate boundary.

=== Alpine–Himalayan orogeny ===

==== Alpine orogeny ====
The Alpine orogeny developed in response to the collision between the African and Eurasian plates during the closing of the Neotethys Ocean and the opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean. The result was a series of arcuate mountain ranges, from the Tell-Rif-Betic cordillera in the western Mediterranean through the Alps, Carpathians, Apennines, Dinarides and Hellenides to the Taurides in the east.

From the Late Cretaceous into the early Paleocene, Africa began to converge with Eurasia. The irregular outlines of the continental margins, including the Adriatic promontory (Adria) that extended north from the African plate, led to the development of several short subduction zones, rather than one long system. In the western Mediterranean, the European plate was subducted southwards beneath the African plate, whilst in the eastern Mediterranean, Africa was subducted beneath Eurasia along a northward dipping subduction zone. Convergence between the Iberian and European plates led to the Pyrenean orogeny and, as Adria pushed northwards the Alps and Carpathian orogens began to develop.

The collision of Adria with Eurasia in the early Palaeocene was followed by a c.10 million year pause in the convergence of Africa and Eurasia, connected with the onset of the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean as Greenland rifted from the Eurasian plate in the Palaeocene. Convergence rates between Africa and Eurasia increased again in the early Eocene and the remaining oceanic basins between Adria and Europe closed.

Between about 40 and 30 Ma, subduction began along the western Mediterranean arc of the Tell, Rif, Betic and Apennine mountain chains. The rate of convergence was less than the subduction rate of the dense lithosphere of the western Mediterranean and roll-back of the subducting slab led to the arcuate structure of these mountain ranges.

In the eastern Mediterranean, c. 35 Ma, the Anatolide-Tauride platform (northern part of Adria) began to enter the trench leading to the development of the Dinarides, Hellenides and Tauride mountain chains as the passive margin sediments of Adria were scrapped off onto the Eurasia crust during subduction.

==== Zagros Mountains ====
The Zagros mountain belt stretches for c. 2000 km from the eastern border of Iraq to the Makran coast in southern Iran. It formed as a result of the convergence and collision of the Arabian and Eurasian plates as the Neotethys Ocean closed and is composed sediments scrapped from the descending Arabian Plate.

From the Late Cretaceous, a volcanic arc developed on the Eurasia margin as the Neotethys crust was subducted beneath it. A separate intra-oceanic subduction zone in the Neotethys resulted in the obuction of ocean crust onto the Arabian margin in the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene, with break-off of the subducted oceanic plate close to the Arabian margin occurring during the Eocene. Continental collision began during the Eocene c. 35 Ma and continued into the Oligocene to c. 26 Ma.

==== Himalayan orogeny ====

The Indian continent rifted from Madagascar at c. 83 Ma and drifted rapidly (c. 18 cm/yr in the Paleocene) northwards towards the southern margin of Eurasia. A rapid decrease in velocity to c. 5 cm/yr in the early Eocene records the collision of the Tethyan (Tibetan) Himalayas, the leading edge of Greater India, with the Lhasa terrane of Tibet (southern Eurasian margin), along the Indus-Yarling-Zangbo suture zone. To the south of this zone, the Himalaya are composed of metasedimentary rocks scraped off the now subducted Indian continental crust and mantle lithosphere as the collision progressed.

Palaeomagnetic data place the present day Indian continent further south at the time of collision and decrease in plate velocity, indicating the presence of a large region to the north of India that has now been subducted beneath the Eurasian plate or incorporated into the mountain belt. This region, known as Greater India, formed by extension along the northern margin of India during the opening of the Neotethys. The Tethyan Himalaya block lay along its northern edge, with the Neotethys Ocean lying between it and southern Eurasia.

Debate about the amount of deformation seen in the geological record in the India–Eurasia collision zone versus the size of Greater India, the timing and nature of the collision relative to the decrease in plate velocity, and explanations for the unusually high velocity of the Indian plate have led to several models for Greater India: 1) A Late Cretaceous to early Paleocene subduction zone may have lain between India and Eurasia in the Neotethys, dividing the region into two plates, subduction was followed by collision of India with Eurasia in the middle Eocene. In this model Greater India would have been less than 900 km wide; 2) Greater India may have formed a single plate, several thousand kilometres wide, with the Tethyan Himalaya microcontinent separated from the Indian continent by an oceanic basin. The microcontinent collided with southern Eurasia c. 58 Ma (late Paleocene), whilst the velocity of the plate did not decrease until c. 50 Ma when subduction rates dropped as young, oceanic crust entered the subduction zone; 3) This model assigns older dates to parts of Greater India, which changes its paleogeographic position relative to Eurasia and creates a Greater India formed of extended continental crust 2000–3000 km wide.

==== South East Asia ====
The Alpine-Himalayan Orogenic Belt in Southeast Asia extends from the Himalayas in India through Myanmar (West Burma block) Sumatra, Java to West Sulawesi.

During the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene, the northward movement of the Indian plate led to the highly oblique subduction of the Neotethys along the edge of the West Burma block and the development of a major north-south transform fault along the margin of Southeast Asia to the south. Between c. 60 and 50 Ma, the leading northeastern edge of Greater India collided with the West Burma block resulting in deformation and metamorphism. During the middle Eocene, north-dipping subduction resumed along the southern edge of Southeast Asia, from west Sumatra to West Sulawesi, as the Australian plate drifted slowly northwards.

Collision between India and the West Burma block was complete by the late Oligocene. As the India-Eurasia collision continued, movement of material away from the collision zone was accommodated along, and extended, the already existing major strike slip systems of the region.

=== Atlantic Ocean ===
During the Paleocene, seafloor spreading along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge propagated from the Central Atlantic northwards between North America and Greenland in the Labrador Sea (c. 62 Ma) and Baffin Bay (c. 57 Ma), and, by the early Eocene (c. 54 Ma), into the northeastern Atlantic between Greenland and Eurasia. Extension between North America and Eurasia, also in the early Eocene, led to the opening of the Eurasian Basin across the Arctic, which was linked to the Baffin Bay Ridge and Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the south via major strike slip faults.

From the Eocene and into the early Oligocene, Greenland acted as an independent plate moving northwards and rotating anticlockwise. This led to compression across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Svalbard and northern Greenland resulting in the Eureka orogeny. From c. 47 Ma, the eastern margin of Greenland was cut by the Reykjanes Ridge (the northeastern branch of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge) propagating northwards and splitting off the Jan Mayen microcontinent.

After c. 33 Ma seafloor spreading in Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay gradually ceased and seafloor spreading focused along the northeast Atlantic. By the late Oligocene, the plate boundary between North America and Eurasia was established along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with Greenland attached to the North American plate again, and the Jan Mayen microcontinent part of the Eurasian plate, where its remains now lie to the east and possibly beneath the southeast of Iceland.

==== North Atlantic Large Igneous Province ====
The North Atlantic Igneous Province stretches across the Greenland and northwest European margins and is associated with the proto-Icelandic mantle plume, which rose beneath the Greenland lithosphere at c. 65 Ma. There were two main phases of volcanic activity with peaks at c. 60 Ma and c. 55 Ma. Magmatism in the British and Northwest Atlantic volcanic provinces occurred mainly in the early Palaeocene, the latter associated with an increased spreading rate in the Labrador Sea, whilst northeast Atlantic magmatism occurred mainly during the early Eocene and is associated with a change in the spreading direction in the Labrador Sea and the northward drift of Greenland. The locations of the magmatism coincide with the intersection of propagating the rifts and large-scale, pre-existing lithospheric structures, which acted as channels to the surface for the magma.

The arrival of the proto-Iceland plume has been considered the driving mechanism for rifting in the North Atlantic. However, that rifting and initial seafloor spreading occurred prior to the arrival of the plume, large scale magmatism occurred at a distance to rifting, and that rifting propagated towards, rather than away from the plume, has led to the suggestion the plume and associated magmatism may have been a result, rather than a cause, of the plate tectonic forces that led to the propagation of rifting from the Central to the North Atlantic.

=== Americas ===

==== North America ====
Mountain building continued along the North America Cordillera in response to subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the North American Plate. Along the central section of the North American margin, crustal shortening of the Cretaceous to Paleocene Sevier orogen lessened and deformation moved eastward. The decreasing dip of the subducting Farallon plate led to a flat-slab segment that increased friction between this and the base of the North American Plate. The resulting Laramide orogeny, which began the development of the Rocky Mountains, was a broad zone of thick-skinned deformation, with faults extending to mid-crustal depths and the uplift of basement rocks that lay to the east of the Sevier belt, and more than 700km from the trench. With the Laramide uplift the Western Interior Seaway was divided and then retreated.

During the mid to late Eocene (50–35 Ma), plate convergence rates decreased and the dip of the Farallon slab began to steepen. Uplift ceased and the region largely levelled by erosion. By the Oligocene, convergence gave way to extension, rifting and widespread volcanism across the Laramide belt.

==== South America ====
Ocean-continent convergence accommodated by east dipping subduction zone of the Farallon plate beneath the western edge of South America continued from the Mesozoic.

Over the Paleogene, changes in plate motion and episodes of regional slab shallowing and steepening resulted in variations in the magnitude of crustal shortening and amounts of magmatism along the length of the Andes. In the Northern Andes, an oceanic plateau with volcanic arc was accreted during the latest Cretaceous and Paleocene, whilst the Central Andes were dominated by the subduction of oceanic crust and the Southern Andes were impacted by the subduction of the Farallon-East Antarctic ocean ridge.

==== Caribbean ====
The Caribbean plate is largely composed of oceanic crust of the Caribbean Large Igneous Province that formed during the Late Cretaceous. During the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene, subduction of Atlantic crust was established along its northern margin, whilst to the southwest, an island arc collided with the northern Andes forming an east dipping subduction zone where Caribbean lithosphere was subducted beneath the South American margin.

During the Eocene (c. 45 Ma), subduction of the Farallon plate along the Central American subduction zone was (re)established. Subduction along the northern section of the Caribbean volcanic arc ceased as the Bahamas carbonate platform collided with Cuba and was replaced by strike-slip movements as a transform fault, extending from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, connected with the northern boundary of the Caribbean Plate. Subduction now focused along the southern Caribbean arc (Lesser Antilles).

By the Oligocene, the intra-oceanic Central American volcanic arc began to collide with northwestern South American.

=== Pacific Ocean ===
At the beginning of the Paleogene, the Pacific Ocean consisted of the Pacific, Farallon, Kula and Izanagi plates. The central Pacific plate grew by seafloor spreading as the other three plates were subducted and broken up. In the southern Pacific, seafloor spreading continued from the Late Cretaceous across the Pacific–Antarctic, Pacific-Farallon and Farallon–Antarctic mid ocean ridges.

The Izanagi-Pacific spreading ridge lay nearly parallel to the East Asian subduction zone and between 60–50 Ma the spreading ridge began to be subducted. By c. 50 Ma, the Pacific plate was no longer surrounded by spreading ridges, but had a subduction zone along its western edge. This changed the forces acting on the Pacific plate and led to a major reorganisation of plate motions across the entire Pacific region. The resulting changes in stress between the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates initiated subduction along the Izu-Bonin-Mariana and Tonga-Kermadec arcs.

Subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the American plates continued from the Late Cretaceous. The Kula-Farallon spreading ridge lay to its north until the Eocene (c. 55 Ma), when the northern section of the plate split forming the Vancouver/Juan de Fuca plate. In the Oligocene (c. 28 Ma), the first segment of the Pacific–Farallon spreading ridge entered the North American subduction zone near Baja California leading to major strike-slip movements and the formation of the San Andreas Fault. At the Paleogene-Neogene boundary, spreading ceased between the Pacific and Farallon plates and the Farallon plate split again forming the present date Nazca and Cocos plates.

The Kula plate lay between Pacific plate and North America. To the north and northwest it was being subducted beneath the Aleutian trench. Spreading between the Kula and Pacific and Farallon plates ceased c. 40 Ma and the Kula plate became part of the Pacific Plate.

==== Hawaii hotspot ====
The Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain formed above the Hawaiian hotspot. Originally thought to be stationary within the mantle, the hotspot is now considered to have drifted south during the Paleocene to early Eocene, as the Pacific plate moved north. At c. 47 Ma, movement of the hotspot ceased and the Pacific plate motion changed from northward to northwestward in response to the onset of subduction along its western margin. This resulted in a 60 degree bend in the seamount chain. Other seamount chains related to hotspots in the South Pacific show a similar change in orientation at this time.

=== Antarctica ===
Slow seafloor spreading continued between Australia and East Antarctica. Shallow water channels probably developed south of Tasmania opening the Tasmanian Passage in the Eocene and deep ocean routes opening from the mid Oligocene. Rifting between the Antarctic Peninsula and the southern tip of South America formed the Drake Passage and opened the Southern Ocean also during this time, completing the breakup of Gondwana. The opening of these passages and the creation of the Southern Ocean established the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Glaciers began to build across the Antarctica continent that now lay isolated in the south polar region and surrounded by cold ocean waters. These changes contributed to the fall in global temperatures and the beginning of icehouse conditions.

=== Red Sea and East Africa ===
Extensional stresses from the subduction zone along the northern Neotethys resulted in rifting between Africa and Arabia, forming the Gulf of Aden in the late Eocene. To the west, in the early Oligocene, flood basalts erupted across Ethiopia, northeast Sudan and southwest Yemen as the Afar mantle plume began to impact the base of the African lithosphere. Rifting across the southern Red Sea began in the mid Oligocene, and across the central and northern Red Sea regions in the late Oligocene and early Miocene.

== Climate ==
Climatic conditions varied considerably during the Paleogene. After the disruption of the Chicxulub impact settled, a period of cool and dry conditions continued from the Late Cretaceous. At the Paleocene-Eocene boundary global temperatures rose rapidly with the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). By the middle Eocene, temperatures began to drop again and by the late Eocene (c. 37 Ma) had decreased sufficiently for ice sheets to form in Antarctica. The global climate entered icehouse conditions at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary and the present day Late Cenozoic ice age began.

The Paleogene began with the brief but intense &quot;impact winter&quot; caused by the Chicxulub impact, which was followed by an abrupt period of warming. After temperatures stabilised, the steady cooling and drying of the Late Cretaceous-Early Paleogene Cool Interval that had spanned the last two ages of the Late Cretaceous continued, with only the brief interruption of the Latest Danian Event (c. 62.2 Ma) when global temperatures rose. There is no evidence for ice sheets at the poles during the Paleocene.

The relatively cool conditions were brought to an end by the Thanetian Thermal Event, and the beginning of the PETM. This was one of the warmest times of the Phanerozoic eon, during which global mean surface temperatures increased to 31.6 °C. According to a study published in 2018, from about 56 to 48 Ma, annual air temperatures over land and at mid-latitude averaged about 23–29 °C (± 4.7 °C). For comparison, this was 10 to 15 °C higher than the current annual mean temperatures in these areas. 

This rapid rise in global temperatures and intense greenhouse conditions were due to a sudden increase in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. An accompanying rise in humidity is reflected in an increase in kaolinite in sediments, which forms by chemical weathering in hot, humid conditions. Tropical and subtropical forests flourished and extended into polar regions. Water vapour (a greenhouse gas) associated with these forests also contributed to the greenhouse conditions.

The initial rise in global temperatures was related to the intrusion of magmatic sills into organic-rich sediments during volcanic activity in the North Atlantic Igneous Province, between about 56 and 54 Ma, which rapidly released large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This warming led to melting of frozen methane hydrates on continental slopes adding further greenhouses gases. It also reduced the rate of burial of organic matter as higher temperatures accelerated the rate of bacterial decomposition which released CO2 back into the oceans.

The (relatively) sudden climatic changes associated with the PETM resulted in the extinction of some groups of fauna and flora and the rise of others. For example, with the warming of the Arctic Ocean, around 70% of deep sea foraminifera species went extinct, whilst on land many modern mammals, including primates, appeared. Fluctuating sea levels meant, during low stands, a land bridge formed across the Bering Straits between North America and Eurasia allowing the movement of land animals between the two continents.

The PETM was followed by the less severe Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (c. 53.69 Ma), and the Eocene Thermal Maximum 3 (c. 53 Ma). The early Eocene warm conditions were brought to an end by the Azolla event. This change of climate at about 48.5 Ma, is believed to have been caused by a proliferation of aquatic ferns from the genus &quot;Azolla&quot;, resulting in the sequestering of large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere by the plants. From this time until about 34 Ma, there was a slow cooling trend known as the Middle-Late Eocene Cooling. As temperatures dropped at high latitudes the presence of cold water diatoms suggests sea ice was able to form in winter in the Arctic Ocean, and by the late Eocene (c. 37 Ma) there is evidence of glaciation in Antarctica. 

Changes in deep ocean currents, as Australia and South America moved away from Antarctica opening the Drake and Tasmanian passages, were responsible for the drop in global temperatures. The warm waters of the South Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific oceans extended southward into the opening Southern Ocean and became part of the cold circumpolar current. Dense polar waters sank into the deep oceans and moved northwards, reducing global ocean temperatures. This cooling may have occurred over less than 100,000 years and resulted in a widespread extinction in marine life. By the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, sediments deposited in the ocean from glaciers indicate the presence of an ice sheet in western Antarctica that extended to the ocean.

The development of the circumpolar current led to changes in the oceans, which in turn reduced atmospheric CO2 further. Increasing upwellings of cold water stimulated the productivity of phytoplankton, and the cooler waters reduced the rate of bacterial decay of organic matter and promoted the growth of methane hydrates in marine sediments. This created a positive feedback cycle where global cooling reduced atmospheric CO2 and this reduction in CO2 lead to changes which further lowered global temperatures. The decrease in evaporation from the cooler oceans also reduced moisture in the atmosphere and increased aridity. By the early Oligocene, the North American and Eurasian tropical and subtropical forests were replaced by dry woodlands and widespread grasslands.

The Early Oligocene Glacial Maximum lasted for about 200,000 years, and the global mean surface temperature continued to decrease gradually during the Rupelian. A drop in global sea levels during the mid Oligocene indicates major growth of the Antarctic glacial ice sheet. In the Late Oligocene, global temperatures began to warm slightly, though they continued to be significantly lower than during the previous epochs of the Paleogene and polar ice remained.

==Flora and fauna==

Tropical taxa diversified faster than those at higher latitudes after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, resulting in the development of a significant latitudinal diversity gradient. 

Mammals began a rapid diversification during this period. After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which saw the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs, mammals began to evolve from a few small and generalized forms into most of the modern varieties we see presently. Some of these mammals evolved into large forms that dominated the land, while others became capable of living in marine, specialized terrestrial, and airborne environments. Those that adapted to the oceans became modern cetaceans and sirenians, while those that adapted to trees became primates, the group to which humans belong. 

Birds, extant dinosaurs which were already well established by the end of the Cretaceous, also experienced adaptive radiation as they took over the skies left empty by the now extinct pterosaurs. Some flightless birds such as penguins, ratites, and terror birds also filled niches left by the hesperornithes and other extinct dinosaurs.

Myctophids first appeared in the Late Palaeocene or Early Eocene, and during the Eocene and most of the Oligocene were restricted to shelf seas before expanding their range into the open ocean during the warm climatic interval at the end of the Oligocene.

Pronounced cooling in the Oligocene resulted in a massive floral shift, and many extant modern plants arose during this time. Grasses and herbs, such as &quot;Artemisia&quot;, began to proliferate, at the expense of tropical plants, which began to decrease. Conifer forests developed in mountainous areas. This cooling trend continued, with major fluctuation, until the end of the Pleistocene period. This evidence for this floral shift is found in the palynological record.

<text>In mathematics, especially in order theory, a preorder or quasiorder is a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive. The name is meant to suggest that preorders are &quot;almost&quot; partial orders, but not quite, as they are not necessarily antisymmetric.

A natural example of a preorder is the divides relation &quot;x divides y&quot; between integers, polynomials, or elements of a commutative ring. For example, the divides relation is reflexive as every integer divides itself. But the divides relation is not antisymmetric, because formula_1 divides formula_2 and formula_2 divides formula_1. It is to this preorder that &quot;greatest&quot; and &quot;lowest&quot; refer in the phrases &quot;greatest common divisor&quot; and &quot;lowest common multiple&quot; (except that, for integers, the greatest common divisor is also the greatest for the natural order of the integers). 

Preorders are closely related to equivalence relations and (non-strict) partial orders. Both of these are special cases of a preorder: an antisymmetric preorder is a partial order, and a symmetric preorder is an equivalence relation. Moreover, a preorder on a set formula_5 can equivalently be defined as an equivalence relation on formula_5, together with a partial order on the set of equivalence class. Like partial orders and equivalence relations, preorders (on a nonempty set) are never asymmetric.

A preorder can be visualized as a directed graph, with elements of the set corresponding to vertices, and the order relation between pairs of elements corresponding to the directed edges between vertices. The converse is not true: most directed graphs are neither reflexive nor transitive. A preorder that is antisymmetric no longer has cycles; it is a partial order, and corresponds to a directed acyclic graph. A preorder that is symmetric is an equivalence relation; it can be thought of as having lost the direction markers on the edges of the graph. In general, a preorder&#x27;s corresponding directed graph may have many disconnected components.

As a binary relation, a preorder may be denoted formula_7 or formula_8. In words, when formula_9 one may say that &quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; or that &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot;, or that &quot;b&quot; to &quot;a&quot;. Occasionally, the notation ← or → is also used.

== Definition ==

Let formula_7 be a binary relation on a set formula_11 so that by definition, formula_7 is some subset of formula_13 and the notation formula_14 is used in place of formula_15 Then formula_7 is called a &#x27; or &#x27; if it is reflexive and transitive; that is, if it satisfies:
#Reflexivity: formula_17 for all formula_18 and
#Transitivity: if formula_19 for all formula_20 

A set that is equipped with a preorder is called a preordered set (or proset).

==Preorders as partial orders on partitions==

Given a preorder formula_7 on formula_22 one may define an equivalence relation formula_23 on formula_22 such that 
formula_25 
The resulting relation formula_23 is reflexive since the preorder formula_7 is reflexive; transitive by applying the transitivity of formula_7 twice; and symmetric by definition. 

Using this relation, it is possible to construct a partial order on the quotient set of the equivalence, formula_29 which is the set of all equivalence classes of formula_30 If the preorder is denoted by formula_31 then formula_32 is the set of formula_33-cycle equivalence classes: 
formula_34 if and only if formula_35 or formula_36 is in an formula_33-cycle with formula_38. 
In any case, on formula_32 it is possible to define formula_40 if and only if formula_41 
That this is well-defined, meaning that its defining condition does not depend on which representatives of formula_42 and formula_43 are chosen, follows from the definition of formula_44 It is readily verified that this yields a partially ordered set.

Conversely, from any partial order on a partition of a set formula_45 it is possible to construct a preorder on formula_22 itself. There is a one-to-one correspondence between preorders and pairs (partition, partial order).

: Let formula_22 be a formal theory, which is a set of sentences with certain properties (details of which can be found in the article on the subject). For instance, formula_22 could be a first-order theory (like Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory) or a simpler zeroth-order theory. One of the many properties of formula_22 is that it is closed under logical consequences so that, for instance, if a sentence formula_50 logically implies some sentence formula_51 which will be written as formula_52 and also as formula_53 then necessarily formula_54 (by &quot;modus ponens&quot;). 
The relation formula_55 is a preorder on formula_22 because formula_57 always holds and whenever formula_58 and formula_59 both hold then so does formula_60 
Furthermore, for any formula_61 formula_62 if and only if formula_63; that is, two sentences are equivalent with respect to formula_55 if and only if they are logically equivalent. This particular equivalence relation formula_62 is commonly denoted with its own special symbol formula_66 and so this symbol formula_67 may be used instead of formula_30 The equivalence class of a sentence formula_69 denoted by formula_70 consists of all sentences formula_54 that are logically equivalent to formula_72 (that is, all formula_54 such that formula_74). 
The partial order on formula_32 induced by formula_76 which will also be denoted by the same symbol formula_76 is characterized by formula_78 if and only if formula_79 where the right hand side condition is independent of the choice of representatives formula_80 and formula_81 of the equivalence classes. 
All that has been said of formula_55 so far can also be said of its converse relation formula_83 
The preordered set formula_84 is a directed set because if formula_85 and if formula_86 denotes the sentence formed by logical conjunction formula_87 then formula_88 and formula_59 where formula_90 The partially ordered set formula_91 is consequently also a directed set. 
See Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra for a related example.

==Relationship to strict partial orders==
If reflexivity is replaced with irreflexivity (while keeping transitivity) then we get the definition of a strict partial order on formula_92. For this reason, the term is sometimes used for a strict partial order. That is, this is a binary relation formula_93 on formula_92 that satisfies:
===Strict partial order induced by a preorder===

Any preorder formula_7 gives rise to a strict partial order defined by formula_96 if and only if formula_14 and not formula_98.
Using the equivalence relation formula_23 introduced above, formula_96 if and only if formula_101 
and so the following holds
formula_102
The relation formula_93 is a strict partial order and strict partial order can be constructed this way. 
 the preorder formula_7 is antisymmetric (and thus a partial order) then the equivalence formula_23 is equality (that is, formula_106 if and only if formula_107) and so in this case, the definition of formula_93 can be restated as: 
formula_109
But importantly, this new condition is used as (nor is it equivalent to) the general definition of the relation formula_93 (that is, formula_93 is defined as: formula_96 if and only if formula_113) because if the preorder formula_7 is not antisymmetric then the resulting relation formula_93 would not be transitive (consider how equivalent non-equal elements relate). 
This is the reason for using the symbol &quot;formula_116&quot; instead of the &quot;less than or equal to&quot; symbol &quot;formula_117&quot;, which might cause confusion for a preorder that is not antisymmetric since it might misleadingly suggest that formula_118 implies formula_119 

===Preorders induced by a strict partial order===

Using the construction above, multiple non-strict preorders can produce the same strict preorder formula_120 so without more information about how formula_93 was constructed (such knowledge of the equivalence relation formula_23 for instance), it might not be possible to reconstruct the original non-strict preorder from formula_123 Possible (non-strict) preorders that induce the given strict preorder formula_93 include the following:
* Define formula_118 as formula_126 (that is, take the reflexive closure of the relation). This gives the partial order associated with the strict partial order &quot;formula_127&quot; through reflexive closure; in this case the equivalence is equality formula_128 so the symbols formula_7 and formula_23 are not needed. 
* Define formula_14 as &quot;formula_132&quot; (that is, take the inverse complement of the relation), which corresponds to defining formula_106 as &quot;neither formula_134&quot;; these relations formula_7 and formula_23 are in general not transitive; however, if they are then formula_23 is an equivalence; in that case &quot;formula_127&quot; is a strict weak order. The resulting preorder is connected (formerly called total); that is, a total preorder.

If formula_118 then formula_140 
The converse holds (that is, formula_141) if and only if whenever formula_142 then formula_96 or formula_144

==Examples==

===Graph theory===

* The reachability relationship in any directed graph (possibly containing cycles) gives rise to a preorder, where formula_145 in the preorder if and only if there is a path from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; in the directed graph. Conversely, every preorder is the reachability relationship of a directed graph (for instance, the graph that has an edge from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; for every pair with formula_145). However, many different graphs may have the same reachability preorder as each other. In the same way, reachability of directed acyclic graphs, directed graphs with no cycles, gives rise to partially ordered sets (preorders satisfying an additional antisymmetry property).
* The graph-minor relation is also a preorder.

===Computer science===
In computer science, one can find examples of the following preorders.
* Asymptotic order causes a preorder over functions formula_147. The corresponding equivalence relation is called asymptotic equivalence.
* Polynomial-time, many-one (mapping) and Turing reductions are preorders on complexity classes.
* Subtyping relations are usually preorders.
* Simulation preorders are preorders (hence the name).
* Reduction relations in abstract rewriting systems.
* The encompassment preorder on the set of terms, defined by formula_148 if a subterm of &quot;t&quot; is a substitution instance of &quot;s&quot;.
* Theta-subsumption, which is when the literals in a disjunctive first-order formula are contained by another, after applying a substitution to the former.

===Category theory===

* A category with at most one morphism from any object &quot;x&quot; to any other object &quot;y&quot; is a preorder. Such categories are called thin. Here the objects correspond to the elements of formula_11 and there is one morphism for objects which are related, zero otherwise. In this sense, categories &quot;generalize&quot; preorders by allowing more than one relation between objects: each morphism is a distinct (named) preorder relation.
* Alternately, a preordered set can be understood as an enriched category, enriched over the category formula_150

===Other===
Further examples:
* Every finite topological space gives rise to a preorder on its points by defining formula_145 if and only if &quot;x&quot; belongs to every neighborhood of &quot;y&quot;. Every finite preorder can be formed as the specialization preorder of a topological space in this way. That is, there is a one-to-one correspondence between finite topologies and finite preorders. However, the relation between infinite topological spaces and their specialization preorders is not one-to-one.

* A net is a directed preorder, that is, each pair of elements has an upper bound. The definition of convergence via nets is important in topology, where preorders cannot be replaced by partially ordered sets without losing important features.

* The relation defined by formula_145 if formula_153 where &quot;f&quot; is a function into some preorder.
* The relation defined by formula_145 if there exists some injection from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;. Injection may be replaced by surjection, or any type of structure-preserving function, such as ring homomorphism, or permutation.
* The embedding relation for countable total orderings.

Example of a total preorder:
* Preference, according to common models.

==Constructions==

Every binary relation formula_33 on a set formula_22 can be extended to a preorder on formula_22 by taking the transitive closure and reflexive closure, formula_158 The transitive closure indicates path connection in formula_159 if and only if there is an formula_33-path from formula_36 to formula_162 

Left residual preorder induced by a binary relation

Given a binary relation formula_163 the complemented composition formula_164 forms a preorder called the left residual, where formula_165 denotes the converse relation of formula_163 and formula_167 denotes the complement relation of formula_163 while formula_169 denotes relation composition.

==Related definitions==

If a preorder is also antisymmetric, that is, formula_14 and formula_98 implies formula_172 then it is a partial order.

On the other hand, if it is symmetric, that is, if formula_14 implies formula_174 then it is an equivalence relation.

A preorder is total if formula_14 or formula_98 for all formula_177

A preordered class is a class equipped with a preorder. Every set is a class and so every preordered set is a preordered class.

==Uses==
Preorders play a pivotal role in several situations:
* Every preorder can be given a topology, the Alexandrov topology; and indeed, every preorder on a set is in one-to-one correspondence with an Alexandrov topology on that set.
* Preorders may be used to define interior algebras.
* Preorders provide the Kripke semantics for certain types of modal logic.
* Preorders are used in forcing in set theory to prove consistency and independence results.

==Number of preorders==
As explained above, there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between preorders and pairs (partition, partial order). Thus the number of preorders is the sum of the number of partial orders on every partition. For example:
==Interval==
For formula_9 the interval formula_179 is the set of points &quot;x&quot; satisfying formula_180 and formula_181 also written formula_182 It contains at least the points &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. One may choose to extend the definition to all pairs formula_183 The extra intervals are all empty.

Using the corresponding strict relation &quot;formula_127&quot;, one can also define the interval formula_183 as the set of points &quot;x&quot; satisfying formula_186 and formula_187 also written formula_188 An open interval may be empty even if formula_189

Also formula_190 and formula_191 can be defined similarly.

<text>Psychoanalysis is a set of theories and therapeutic techniques that deal in part with the unconscious mind, and which together form a method of treatment for mental disorders. The discipline was established in the early 1890s by Sigmund Freud, whose work stemmed partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others. Freud developed and refined the theory and practice of psychoanalysis until his death in 1939. In an encyclopedic article, he identified the cornerstones of psychoanalysis as &quot;the assumption that there are unconscious mental processes, the recognition of the theory of repression and resistance, the appreciation of the importance of sexuality and of the Oedipus complex.&quot; Freud&#x27;s colleagues Alfred Adler and Carl Gustav Jung developed offshoots of psychoanalysis which they called individual psychology (Adler) and analytical psychology (Jung), although Freud himself wrote a number of criticisms of them and emphatically denied that they were forms of psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis was later developed in different directions by neo-Freudian thinkers, such as Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan. Jacques Lacan&#x27;s theory essentially represents a return to Freud. He described Freudian metapsychology as a technical elaboration of the three-instance model of the psyche and primarily examined the logical structure of the unconscious.

Freud distinguished between the conscious and unconscious realms of the psyche and held the view that the contents of unconscious largely determine cognition and behaviour. He found that many of the drives - since his structural model located in the ‘id’ - are repressed into the unconscious due to traumatic experiences during childhood and that the attempt to integrate them into the ego&#x27;s conscious perception triggers resistance. This and other defense mechanisms strive to maintain the repression; this is accompanied by conflicts between the unconscious drive parts and the conscious material and can lead to mental disturbances. Freud also discovered that the drive desires repressed into the unconscious reveal themselves particularly in the symbols of dreams, furtherhin in the symptoms of neurotis and Freudian slips. Psychoanalysis, or short analytical therapy, was developed in order to clarify the causes of the disorders diagnostically and to restore mental health on the basis of this insights. This is possible by enabling the conscious to become aware of the id&#x27;s needs that have been repressed into the unconscious and to find a realistic solution to resolve the conflicts. Freud summarised this goal of therapy in his demand ‘Where id was, ego shall became.’ He attached great importance to the consistency of his structural model and its compatibility with the findings of biology, including a well-founded theory of healthy human development, which is naturally completed in three successive stages: the oral, anal and genital phase. Psychoanalysts place large emphasis on experiences of early childhood and abolition of infantile amnesia.

In traditional Freudian setting, the patient lies on a couch, and the analyst sits just behind or somehow out of sight. The patient should express all his thoughts, all secrets and dreams, including free associations and fantasies. In addition to its task of strengthening the ego with its ability to think logically - the &quot;primacy of the intellect&quot; -, therapy also aims to induce transference. The patient thus projects his educators as internalized in his superego since early childhood onto the analyst. As he once did as a baby and little child, he experiences the feelings of helpless dependence, the futile longing for love and anger, but now with the possibility of processing these contents that have shaped his persona. 

From the sum of what is communicated, the analyst deduces unconscious conflicts with imposed traumas that are causing the patient&#x27;s symptoms and character problems, and works out a diagnosis. This explanation of the origin of the loss of mental health and the analytical processes as a whole confronts the patients ego with the pathological defence mechanisms, makes him aware of them as well as the contents of the id that have been repressed by them, and thus helps him to better understand the world in which he lives and was educated. (&quot;All people ‘project’ irrational content everywhere. The term Countertransference means that the analyst himself projects something onto his patient; then he has an own open problem and has to go to his own analyst if he is not yet able to help himself due to inexperience.&quot;) This includes not least the fact that the neurlogical branch of psychoanalysis has recently provided evidence that the brain stores experiences in specialised neuronal networks (memory function of the superego) and the ego focuses the highest forms of its conscious thinking in the frontal lobe.

Psychoanalysis has been a controversial discipline from the outset and its effectiveness as a treatment remains contested, although its influence on psychology and psychiatry is undisputed. Critics of the theory have characterised it as pseudoscientific, as central concepts to the theory like that of the id, ego, and superego are unfalsifiable. Psychoanalytical concepts are also widely used outside the therapeutic field, for example in film and literary criticism, analysis of fairy tales, philosophical perspectives such as Freudo-Marxism and other cultural phenomena.

== Overview ==
Freud distinguished between the conscious and unconscious realms of the psyche and argued that the contents of unconscious largely determine cognition and behaviour. He found that many of the drives – which his structural model locates in the ‘id’ – are repressed into the unconscious as a result of traumatic experiences during childhood and that attempts to integrate them into the conscious perception of the ego triggers resistance. These and other defense mechanisms ‘want’ to maintain the repression – not least with the means of enigma, censorship, internalised fear of punishment or mother-love withdrawal – while the affected instincts resist. All in all, an inner war rages between the id and the ego&#x27;s conscious values, which manifests itself in more or less conspicuous mental disorders, although Freud did not equate the statistical normality of our society with ‘healthy’. &quot;Health can only be described in metapsychological terms.&quot;

He discovered that the instinctive impulses are expressed most clearly – albeit still encoded – in the symbols of dreams as well as in the symptomatic detours of neuroticism and Freudian slips. Psychoanalysis was developed in order to clarify the causes of disorders and to restore mental health by enabling the ego to become aware of the id&#x27;s needs that have been repressed into the unconscious and to find realistic ways of satisfying and/or controlling them. Freud summarised this goal of his therapy in the demand &quot;Where id was, ego shall became&quot;, equating the libido as driving energy of innate needs with the Eros of Socratic-Platonic philosophy.

=== Oedipus rising ===
Freud attached great importance to coherence of his structural model. The metapsychological specification of the functions and interlocking of the three instances was intended to ensure the full connectivity of this ‘psychic apparatus’ with biological sciences, in particular Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution of species, including mankind with his behaviour, natural thinking ability and technological creativity. Such insight is indispensable for the diagnostic process (&quot;sickness&quot; can only be realised as a deviation from &quot;health&quot;: the optimal cooperation of all mental-organic functions), but Freud had to be modest. He had to leave his model of human&#x27;s soul in the unfinished state of a &quot;torso&quot; because – as he stated one last time in Moses and Monotheism – there was no well-founded primate research in the first half of 20th century. Without knowledge of the instinctive social structure of our genetically closest relatives in animal kingdom (instead of Freud&#x27;s single ‘super-strong primal father’, they show combative male groups, but despite their remarkable intelligence still no ability to form political organisations), his thesis of the Darwinian primordial horde as presented for discussion in &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot; cannot be tested and, where necessary, replaced by a realistic model.

Horde life and its abolition through introduction of monogamy (as a political agreement between the sons who murdered the polygamous forefather of the horde) embodies the evolutionary and cultural-historical core of psychoanalysis. The latter aspect is decisive for Freud&#x27;s &quot;Unease in Culture&quot;; his assumption of the outbreak of Oedipus complex in human history is based on it. It led to the formulation of rules of behaviour such as the prohibition of adultery and incest, and thus to the beginning of totemic cultures. All further historical stages of coexistence in societies are rooted in this, from feudalism to our modern nations with their monotheism centralising totemic diversity, organisations of military, politics and trade (s. Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego).

Freud&#x27;s thesis of violent introduction of monogamous cohabitation stand in contrast to the religiously enigmatic reports about the origin of first human couples on earth as an expression of divine will, but closer to the ancient trap to pacify political conflicts among the groups of Neolithic mankind. Examples include Prometheus&#x27; uprising against Zeus, who created Pandora as a fatal wedding gift for Epimetheus to divide and rule the titanic brothers; Plato&#x27;s myth of spherical men cut into isolated individuals for the same reason; and the similarly resolved revolt of inferior gods in the Flood epic Atra-Hasis. Nonetheless, without an examination in the light of modern primate research, as demanded by Freud, these ideas remain in the status of an unproven hypothesis of paleoanthropology, merely a &quot;&quot;just so story&quot; as a not unpleasant English critic wittily called it. But I mean it honours a hypothesis if it shows capable of creating context and understanding in new areas.&quot;

According to Freud, this hypothesis explains the present-day son&#x27;s conflict with his father over his mother, naming this view after Sophocles&#x27; tragedy &quot;Oedipus&quot;, and supplementing it with case studies such as the &quot;Phobia of a five-year-old boy&quot;. However, the author not only discovered this complex and the &#x27;oral fixatet&#x27; Syndrom of Narzissos&#x27; regress back into amniotic fluid (as far as possible given the state of science at the time), but also devised a hypothesis of healthy emotional development, which by nature completes in three successive stages: the oral, anal and genital phases. Whereby the sexual drive of latter takes a ‘latency’ break – the &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; – between the ages of about 7 and 12 for the benefit of social-intellectual growth.

===Traditional setting===
Psychoanalysts place large emphasis on experiences of early childhood, try to overcome infantile amnesia. In traditional Freudian setting, the patient lies on a couch, and the analyst sits just behind or somehow out of sight. The patient should express all his thoughts, all secrets and dreams, including free associations and fantasies. In addition to its task of strengthening the ego with its ability to think dialectical – Freud&#x27;s &quot;primacy of intellect&quot; –, therapy also aims to induce transference. The patient thus projects his educated him mother and father as internalised in his superego since birth onto the analyst. As he once did as a baby and little child, he experiences again the feelings of helpless dependence, all the futile longing for love, anger, rage and urge for revenge on the failing parents, but now with the possibility of processing these contents that have chaped his persona. All people who have been brought up in moralic cultures project irrational fears and hopes for happiness everywhere. The term countertransference means that the analyst himself projects such content onto his patient; then he has an own open problem and has to go to his own analyst if he is not yet able to help himself due to inexperience.

From the sum of what is shown and communicated, the analyst deduces unconscious conflicts with imposed traumas that are causing the patient&#x27;s symptoms, his persona and character problems, and works out a diagnosis. This explanation of the origin of loss of mental health and the analytical processes as a whole confronts the patients ego with the pathological defence mechanisms, makes him aware of them as well as the instinctive contents of the id that have been repressed by them, and thus helps him to better understand himself and the world in which he lives, was born and educated.

===Touching infinity===
Not least this includes the fact that the neurological branch of psychoanalysis recently provided evidence that the brain stores experiences in specialised neuronal networks (memory function of the superego) and the ego performances its highest focus of conscious thinking in frontal lobe. In some respects, Freud himself embodies the founder of this field of modern research. Parallel to the consolidation of psychoanalysis, however, he turned away from it with the argument that &quot;consciousness&quot; is directly given - not to be explained by insights into physiological details. Essentially, two things were known about the living soul: The brain with its nervous system extending over the entire organism and the acts of consciousness. In Freud&#x27;s view, therefore any number of phenomena can be integrated between &quot;both endpoints of our knowledge&quot; (findings of modern neurology just as well as the position of our planet in the universe, for example), but this only contribute to the spatial &quot;localisation of the acts of consciousness&quot;, not to their understanding.

With reference to Descartes, contemporary neuropsychoanalysts explain this situation as mind-body dichotomy, namely both as two total different kinds of &#x27;stuff&#x27;: an objekt and the subjekt that can&#x27;nt objectify itself. With regard to Freud&#x27;s libido they call this dichotomy the &quot;dual-aspect monism&quot;. It touches on the point of psychoanalysis that is most difficult to grasp with the means of empirically based sciences – in fact, only under Kant&#x27;s assumption that living systems always make judgements about the phenomena they perceive with regard to the satisfaction of their immanent needs. Therefore, Freud conceptualised libido as the teleological element of his three-fold soul model, a desiring energy that links &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;purpose&quot;, instead of mere ‘effect’. This universal force embodies the &quot;psychicaly&quot; source that drives all instinctual needs of living beings, as well as the First Cause of their &quot;physicaly&quot; evolution. On this path, sexual behaviour realises Darwin&#x27;s Law of Natural Selection by favouring the most fitting and aesthetically well-proportioned body forms in reproduction. Freud was no less well acquainted with the energetic-&quot;economic&quot; aspect of evolution and psychic processes (s. def. of the three metapsychological vectors) than with the trinity of Greek philosophy, especially Plato&#x27;s transcendent unity of truth: that it expresses the good and the beauty in equal measure, anchored in the proportions of golden ratio.

===&quot;The Question of Lay Analysis&quot;===
Freud&#x27;s worldview, with dream interpretation as &quot;the royal way into unconscious&quot;, wasn&#x27;t conceived as a source of income (&quot;money is not a child&#x27;s desire&quot;), but as a method whose appropriation is open to everyone. In the &quot;Wednesday round&quot; of young psychoanalysis, academics and ‘uneducated’ worked together on an equal footing to rediscover the happiness lost in the Dark Continent of the human soul – not easy to understand for some outsiders. In order to counteract misunderstandings, Freud clearly sets out the only condition for being able to pursue this interest seriously in his treatise on &quot;The Question of Lay Analysis&quot;: the methodical examination of one&#x27;s own inner situation, wherever possible with assistance of an already experienced psychoanalyst.

Psychoanalysis has been a controversial discipline from the outset and its effectiveness as a treatment remains contested, although its influence on psychology and psychiatry is undisputed. Psychoanalytic perspectives are also widely used outside the therapeutic field, for example in film and literary criticism, interpretation of fairy tales or philosophical concepts (replacing Kant&#x27;s a priori with the conditions of mental apparatus), ideologies such as Marxism and the phenomenon of technological as well as cultural creativity of mankind and its zoological closest relatives.

==History==
===1885-1900===
The idea of psychoanalysis began to receive serious attention in the 1890s; Freud called it first &quot;Free Association&quot;. During this time, he worked as a neurologist in a children&#x27;s hospital, where attempts were made to develop an effective treatment for the so-called neurotic symptoms, but detailed examinations didn&#x27;t reveal any organic defects. In the monograph written on this subject, Freud documents his suspicion that neurotic symptoms could have psychological causes.

In 1885, Freud was given the opportunity to study at the Salpêtrière in Paris under the famous neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. Charcot had specialised in the field of hysterical paralysis and anaesthesia and established hypnosis as a research tool, the experimental application of which actually made it possible to eliminate symptoms of this kind. Paralysed people could suddenly walk again, blind ones could see. Although this effect is not known to last long – as Freud discovered in own experiments – the phenomenon of hypnotic false-healing played a decisive role in convincing him of the psycho-traumatical causation of the multifaceted neurotic clinical picture.

Freud&#x27;s first attempt to explain neurotical symptoms was presented in &quot;Studies on Hysteria&quot; (1895). Co-authored with his mentor Josef Breuer, this is generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work based on Freud&#x27;s and Breuer&#x27;s partly joint treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in the case studies by the pseudonym &quot;Anna O&quot;.. Berta herself had dubbed the treatment &quot;talking cure&quot;. Breuer, a distinguished physician, was astonished but remained unspecific; while Freud formulated his hypothesis that Anna&#x27;s hystera seemed to be caused by distressing but unconscious experiences related to sexuality, basing his assumption on corresponding associations made by the young women. She herself sometimes liked to jokingly rename her talking cure as &quot;chimney sweeping&quot; (an association about the fairy tale through which place the stork brings a baby into house) – or in Lacan&#x27;s words: &quot;The more Anna provided signifers, the more she chattered on, the better it went.&quot;

Around the same time, Freud had started to develop a neurological hypothesis about mental phenomena such as memory, but soon abandoned this attempt and left it unpublished. Insights into neuronal-biochemical processes that store experiences in the brain – like engraving the proverbial tabula rasa with some code – belongs to the physiological branch of science and lead in a different direction of research than the psychological question of what the differences between consciousness and unconsciousness are. After some thought about a suitable term, Freud called his new instrument and field of research &quot;psychoanalysis&quot;, introduced in his essay “Inheritance and Etiology of Neuroses”, written and published in French in 1896.

====The abuse thesis====
In 1896, Freud also published his &quot;seduction theory&quot;, in which he assumed as certain that he had uncovered repressed memories of incidents of sexual abuse in each of his previous patients. This type of sexual excitations of the child would therefore be the prerequisite for the later development of hysterical and other kinds of neurotical symptoms.

It contradicts the seduction thesis that Freud reported in the same year about patients who expressed their &quot;emphatic disbelief&quot; in this respect: that they &quot;had no feeling of remembering the infantile sexual scenes&quot;. In the course of his further research, Freud began to doubt his thesis that such abuse should be almost omnipresent in our society. Initially he expressed his suspicion of having made a mistake in private, to his friend and colleague Wilhelm Fliess in 1898; but it took another 8 years before he had clarified the obscure connections sufficiently enough to publicly revoke his thesis, stating the reasons. (Freud&#x27;s final position on the origin of neurosis in general is summarized in his late work &quot;The Discomfort in Culture&quot;. According to this, the causes do not lie in general sexual abuse of children, but in the way in which each generation educates the next to adopt the rules of coexistence known as morality. See also &quot;The Future of an Illusion&quot;.)

====The secrecy mechanism====
In the mid-1890s, he was still upholding his hypothesis of sexual abuse. In this context, he reported on fantasies of several patients, which on the one hand would point to memories of scenes of infantile masturbation stored in the unconscious, while the more conscious parts on the other hand would aim to make these morally forbidden acts of childish pleasure unrecognisable, to cover up them. The interesting point for Freud here was not so much the secretiveness itself (a well-known behaviour of Victorian era), but the following twofold realisation: That children – at that time considered as &quot;innocent&quot; little angels – initiate pleasurable actions of their own accord (have ‘drives’ at all, as later assigned to the ‘id’); and the presumably by aducation initiated emergence of a psychopathological mechanism, whose ability consists in being able to hide impulses of this kind from one&#x27;s own consciousness. Short after he assumed that the same findings would have some evidence for a kind of Oedipal desires.

====From blood disgrace to self-castration====
In the tragedy &quot;Oedipus&quot;, to which Freud refers, there occurs no sexual exploitation of a child by its parents or other adults. Sophocles&#x27; poetic treatment of this ancient Greek myth is about Oedipus&#x27; own sexual desire addresses to his mother Jocasta – admittedly as an already genitally mature man and without knowing about the close blood relationship including an not less unconscious patricide – which the woman reciprocates just as unsuspectingly. Freud interprets the passage where Oedipus – after realising his serious violation of the moral-totemic incest taboo – pokes out his eyes with the golden needle clasp of his wife&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s nightdress (while Jocasta commits suicide) as a manifestation of the same ‘cover-up’ mechanism that he began to uncover in the above-mentioned fantasies. In his eyes psychoanalysis works in opposite direction to this mechanism of preconscious self-delusion, by bringing the due to incest taboo have been repressed desires (the ‘id’) back into realm of inner perception, own conscious thinking. This raised the question for Freud of the first origin of moral prohibitions. A field of research that led him deep into the evolutionary and cultural (prä)history of mankind (see Darwin&#x27;s primal horde; its abolition through patricide and introduction of monogamy in Totem and Taboo) and which, according to his own information, he had to leave unfinished as an untested hypothesis due to the lack of primate research.

====The meaning of dreams====
In 1899, Freud&#x27;s work had progressed far enough that he was able to publish &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;. This, for him, was the most important of his writings, as it formulated the realisation that every dream contains a symbolically disguised message that can be decoded with help of the dreamer&#x27;s free associations. The purpose of every dream is therefore to inform the dreamer about his complex inner situation: in essence, a conflict arising from the demands of innate needs and externally imposed behavioural rules that prohibit their satisfaction. Freud called the former the &quot;primary process&quot;, taking place predominantly in the unconscious, and the latter the &quot;secondary process&quot; of predominantly conscious, more or less coherent thoughts.

Freud summarised this view in his first model of the soul. Known as the &quot;topological model&quot;, it divides the organism into three areas or systems: The unconscious, the preconscious and the conscious. Sexual needs belong to the unconscious and are forced to remain there if the contents of conscious ward them off. This is the case in societys that generally consider all extra- and premarital sexual activity – including homoeroticism, that of biblical Onan and incest – to be a ‘sin’, passing this value on to the next generation through concrete or threatened punishments. Moral education creates fears of punitive violence or the deprive of love in the child&#x27;s soul. They are stored neuronally in the preconscious and influences the consciousness in the sense of the imprinted rules of behaviour. (Freud&#x27;s second model of the soul, the three-instance or structural model, introduces a clearer distinction. &quot;Topology&quot; is no longer the decisive factor here, but the specific &quot;function&quot; of each of the three instances. This new model did not replace the first one: it integrated it.)

&quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; includes the first comprehensive conceptualisation of Oedipus complex: The little boy admires his father because of the mental and physical advantages of the adult man and wants to become like him, but also comes into conflict with him over the women around, cause of the taboo of incest. This initiates - starting from the id - anger that can grow into a deadly urge for revenge against the father. Impulses that the little boy cannot act out (not least due to the child&#x27;s deep dependence on his parents love) and therefore are repressed into unconscious. Symptomatically, this inner situation manifests itself as a feeling of inferiority, even a castration complex. The myth of Oedipus is about the attempt to liberate the &#x27;amputated&#x27; potency of the id, but fails because of the remaining unconscious motives. As the ego is overwhelmed by the punitive fear of the moral content of its ‘preconscious’ superego, it cuts off the instinctive desire for knowledge from itself (blinds itself).

Attempts to find a female equivalent of the Oedipus complex have not yielded good results. According to Freud, girls, because of their anatomically different genitals, cannot identify with their father, nor develop a castration phobia as sons do, so this syndrome seems to be reserved for the opposite sex. Feminist psychoanalysts debate whether the father of psychoanalysis might have been a victim of sexism in this case. To compensate for the perceived disadvantage, they postulate a Jocasta complex consisting of an incestuous desire of mothers for their infant sons; but other analysts criticise this naming and attempt to generalise, since Sophocles&#x27; Jocasta in particular does not exhibit this behaviour. (Instead, she gave her baby away to be killed). The witch&#x27;s special interest in little Hansel (while she merely abuses his sister as a kitchen slave) offers much better evidence here, although such &quot;Crunchy house syndrome&quot; again should not as omnipresent as the Oedipus complex itself.

====Critics of abuse thesis and Freud in general====
In the later second part of the 20th century, several Freud researchers questioned the author&#x27;s perception that his patients had informed him of childhood sexual abuse. Some of them argued that Freud had imposed his preconceived view on his patients, while others raised the suspicion of conscious forgery.
These are two different arguments. The latter questions whether Freud deliberately lied in order to make the allegedly unfounded psychoanalysis appear as a legitimate science; the former assumes an unknowingly committed act. Freud replied at various places in his work the same to both types of argument: That natural science is a process based on trial and error. A slow but sure becoming, in which it is impossible to have precisely defined concepts from the outset, respectively phenomena that from now on have been clarified without any gaps and contradictions. &quot;Indeed, even physics would have missed out on its entire development if it had been forced to wait until its concepts of matter, energy, gravity and others reached the desirable clarity and precision.&quot;

The psychologist Frank Sulloway points out in his book &quot;Freud, Biologist of the Mind: Beyond the Psychoanalytic Legend&quot; that the theories and hypotheses of psychoanalysis are anchored in the findings of contemporary biology. He mentions the profound influence of Charles Darwin‘s theory of evolution on Freud and quotes this sense from the writings of Haeckel, Wilhelm Fliess, Krafft-Ebing and Havelock Ellis.

===1900–1940s===

In 1905, Freud published &quot;Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality&quot; in which he laid out his discovery of the &quot;psychosexual phases&quot;, which categorised early childhood development into five stages depending on what sexual affinity a child possessed at the stage:

* Oral (ages 0–2);
* Anal (2–4);
* Phallic-oedipal or First genital (3–6);
* Latency (6–puberty); and
* Mature genital (puberty–onward).

His early formulation included the idea that because of societal restrictions, sexual wishes were repressed into an unconscious state, and that the energy of these unconscious wishes could be result in anxiety or physical symptoms. Early treatment techniques, including hypnotism and abreaction, were designed to make the unconscious conscious in order to relieve the pressure and the apparently resulting symptoms. This method would later on be left aside by Freud, giving free association a bigger role.

In &quot;On Narcissism&quot; (1914), Freud turned his attention to the titular subject of narcissism. Freud characterized the difference between energy directed at the self versus energy directed at others using a system known as &quot;cathexis&quot;. By 1917, in &quot;Mourning and Melancholia&quot;, he suggested that certain depressions were caused by turning guilt-ridden anger on the self. In 1919, through &quot;A Child is Being Beaten&quot;, he began to address the problems of self-destructive behavior and sexual masochism. Based on his experience with depressed and self-destructive patients, and pondering the carnage of World War I, Freud became dissatisfied with considering only oral and sexual motivations for behavior. By 1920, Freud addressed the power of identification (with the leader and with other members) in groups as a motivation for behavior in &quot;Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego&quot;. In that same year, Freud suggested his &quot;dual drive theory&quot; of sexuality and aggression in &quot;Beyond the Pleasure Principle&quot;, to try to begin to explain human destructiveness. Also, it was the first appearance of his &quot;structural theory&quot; consisting of three new concepts id, ego, and superego.

Three years later, in 1923, he summarised the ideas of id, ego, and superego in &quot;The Ego and the Id&quot;. In the book, he revised the whole theory of mental functioning, now considering that repression was only one of many defense mechanisms, and that it occurred to reduce anxiety. Hence, Freud characterised repression as both a cause and a result of anxiety. In 1926, in &quot;Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety&quot;, Freud characterised how intrapsychic conflict among drive and superego caused anxiety, and how that anxiety could lead to an inhibition of mental functions, such as intellect and speech. In 1924, Otto Rank published The Trauma of Birth, which analysed culture and philosophy in relation to separation anxiety which occurred before the development of an Oedipal complex. Freud&#x27;s theories, however, characterized no such phase. According to Freud, the Oedipus complex was at the centre of neurosis, and was the foundational source of all art, myth, religion, philosophy, therapy—indeed of all human culture and civilization. It was the first time that anyone in Freud&#x27;s inner circle had characterised something other than the Oedipus complex as contributing to intrapsychic development, a notion that was rejected by Freud and his followers at the time.

By 1936 the &quot;Principle of Multiple Function&quot; was clarified by Robert Waelder. He widened the formulation that psychological symptoms were caused by and relieved conflict simultaneously. Moreover, symptoms (such as phobias and compulsions) each represented elements of some drive wish (sexual and/or aggressive), superego, anxiety, reality, and defenses. Also in 1936, Anna Freud, Sigmund&#x27;s daughter, published her seminal book, &quot;The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense&quot;, outlining numerous ways the mind could shut upsetting things out of consciousness.

===1940s–present===
When Hitler&#x27;s power grew, the Freud family and many of their colleagues fled to London. Within a year, Sigmund Freud died. In the United States, also following the death of Freud, a new group of psychoanalysts began to explore the function of the ego. Led by Heinz Hartmann, the group built upon understandings of the &quot;synthetic&quot; function of the ego as a mediator in psychic functioning, distinguishing such from &quot;autonomous&quot; ego functions (e.g. memory and intellect). These &quot;ego psychologists&quot; of the 1950s paved a way to focus analytic work by attending to the defenses (mediated by the ego) before exploring the deeper roots to the unconscious conflicts.

In addition, there was growing interest in child psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis has been used as a research tool into childhood development, and is still used to treat certain mental disturbances. In the 1960s, Freud&#x27;s early thoughts on the childhood development of female sexuality were challenged; this challenge led to the development of a variety of understandings of female sexual development, many of which modified the timing and normality of several of Freud&#x27;s theories. Several researchers followed Karen Horney&#x27;s studies of societal pressures that influence the development of women.

In the first decade of the 21st century, there were approximately 35 training institutes for psychoanalysis in the United States accredited by the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA), which is a component organization of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA), and there are over 3000 graduated psychoanalysts practicing in the United States. The IPA accredits psychoanalytic training centers through such &quot;component organisations&quot; throughout the rest of the world, including countries such as Serbia, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and many others, as well as about six institutes directly in the United States.

===Psychoanalysis as a movement===
Freud founded the &quot;Psychological Wednesday Society&quot; in 1902, which Edward Shorter argues was the beginning of psychoanalysis as a movement. This society became the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society in 1908 in the same year as the first international congress of psychoanalysis held in Salzburg, Austria. Alfred Adler was one of the most active members in this society in its early years.

The second congress of psychoanalysis took place in Nuremberg, Germany in 1910. At this congress, Ferenczi called for the creation of an International Psychoanalytic Association with Jung as president for life. A third congress was held in Weimar in 1911. The London Psychoanalytical Society was founded in 1913 by Ernest Jones.

===Developments of alternative forms of psychotherapy===
====Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)====
In the 1950s, psychoanalysis was the main modality of psychotherapy. Behavioural models of psychotherapy started to assume a more central role in psychotherapy in the 1960s. Aaron T. Beck, a psychiatrist trained in a psychoanalytic tradition, set out to test the psychoanalytic models of depression empirically and found that conscious ruminations of loss and personal failing were correlated with depression. He suggested that distorted and biased beliefs were a causal factor of depression, publishing an influential paper in 1967 after a decade of research using the construct of schemas to explain the depression. Beck developed this empirically supported hypothesis for the cause of depression into a talking therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the early 1970s.

====Attachment theory====

Attachment theory was developed theoretically by John Bowlby and formalized empirically by Mary Ainsworth. Bowlby was trained psychoanalytically but was concerned about some properties of psychoanalysis; he was troubled by the dogmatism of psychoanalysis at the time, its arcane terminology, the lack of attention to environment in child behaviour, and the concepts derived from talking therapy to child behaviour. In response, he developed an alternative conceptualization of child behaviour based on principles on ethology. Bowlby&#x27;s theory of attachment rejects Freud&#x27;s model of psychosexual development based on the Oedipal model. For his work, Bowlby was shunned from psychoanalytical circles who did not accept his theories. Nonetheless, his conceptualization was adopted widely by mother-infant research in the 1970s.

==Theories==
The predominant psychoanalytic theories can be organised into several theoretical schools. Although these perspectives differ, most of them emphasize the influence of unconscious elements on the conscious. There has also been considerable work done on consolidating elements of conflicting theories.

There are some persistent conflicts among psychoanalysts regarding specific causes of certain syndromes, and some disputes regarding the ideal treatment techniques. In the 21st century, psychoanalytic ideas have found influence in fields such as childcare, education, literary criticism, cultural studies, mental health, and particularly psychotherapy. Though most mainstream psychoanalysts subscribe to modern strains of psychoanalytical thought, there are groups who follow the precepts of a single psychoanalyst and their school of thought. Psychoanalytic ideas also play roles in some types of literary analysis such as archetypal literary criticism.

===Topographic theory===
&quot;Topographic theory&quot; was named and first described by Sigmund Freud in &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; (1899). The theory hypothesizes that the mental apparatus can be divided into the systems Conscious, Preconscious, and Unconscious. These systems are not anatomical structures of the brain but, rather, mental processes. Although Freud retained this theory throughout his life, he largely replaced it with the &quot;structural theory&quot;.

===Structural theory===
Structural theory divides the psyche into the id, the ego, and the super-ego. The id is present at birth as the repository of basic instincts, which Freud called &quot;Triebe&quot; (&quot;drives&quot;). Unorganized and unconscious, it operates merely on the &#x27;pleasure principle&#x27;, without realism or foresight. The ego develops slowly and gradually, being concerned with mediating between the urging of the id and the realities of the external world; it thus operates on the &#x27;reality principle&#x27;. The super-ego is held to be the part of the ego in which self-observation, self-criticism and other reflective and judgmental faculties develop. The ego and the super-ego are both partly conscious and partly unconscious.

===Neuropsychoanalysis===
In the late 20th century, neuropsychoanalysis was introduced. The aim of this new field was to bridge the gap between psychoanalytic concepts and neuroscientific findings. Solms theorizes that for every cognition based action, there is a neurological reason behind it. According to Daniela Mosri, neuropsychoanalysis was coined by Solms and is a continuation of the original model proposed by Freud in 1895. Neuropsychoanalysis is an interdisciplinary approach that focuses on how neurobiological mechanisms influence the psychological aspects of the human mind with emphasis on repression, the dynamics of dreams, therapeutic relationships. Neuroimaging is one of the methods used to empirically validate psychoanalytic concepts.

====Ego psychology====
Ego psychology was initially suggested by Freud in &quot;Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety&quot; (1926), while major steps forward would be made through Anna Freud&#x27;s work on defense mechanisms, first published in her book &quot;The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence&quot; (1936).

The theory was refined by Hartmann, Loewenstein, and Kris in a series of papers and books from 1939 through the late 1960s. Leo Bellak was a later contributor. This series of constructs, paralleling some of the later developments of cognitive theory, includes the notions of autonomous ego functions: mental functions not dependent, at least in origin, on intrapsychic conflict. Such functions include: sensory perception, motor control, symbolic thought, logical thought, speech, abstraction, integration (synthesis), orientation, concentration, judgment about danger, reality testing, adaptive ability, executive decision-making, hygiene, and self-preservation. Freud noted that inhibition is one method that the mind may utilize to interfere with any of these functions in order to avoid painful emotions. Hartmann (1950s) pointed out that there may be delays or deficits in such functions.

Frosch (1964) described differences in those people who demonstrated damage to their relationship to reality, but who seemed able to test it.

According to ego psychology, ego strengths, later described by Otto F. Kernberg (1975), include the capacities to control oral, sexual, and destructive impulses; to tolerate painful affects without falling apart; and to prevent the eruption into consciousness of bizarre symbolic fantasy. Synthetic functions, in contrast to autonomous functions, arise from the development of the ego and serve the purpose of managing conflict processes. Defenses are synthetic functions that protect the conscious mind from awareness of forbidden impulses and thoughts. One purpose of ego psychology has been to emphasize that some mental functions can be considered to be basic, rather than derivatives of wishes, affects, or defenses. However, autonomous ego functions can be secondarily affected because of unconscious conflict. For example, a patient may have an hysterical amnesia (memory being an autonomous function) because of intrapsychic conflict (wishing not to remember because it is too painful).

Taken together, the above theories present a group of metapsychological assumptions. Therefore, the inclusive group of the different classical theories provides a cross-sectional view of human mental processes. There are six &quot;points of view&quot;, five described by Freud and a sixth added by Hartmann. Unconscious processes can therefore be evaluated from each of these six points of view:

# Topographic
# Dynamic (the theory of conflict)
# Economic (the theory of energy flow)
# Structural
# Genetic (i.e. propositions concerning origin and development of psychological functions)
# Adaptational (i.e. psychological phenomena as it relates to the external world)

====Modern conflict theory====
&quot;Modern conflict theory&quot;, a variation of ego psychology, is a revised version of structural theory, most notably different by altering concepts related to where repressed thoughts were stored. Modern conflict theory addresses emotional symptoms and character traits as complex solutions to mental conflict. It dispenses with the concepts of a fixed id, ego and superego, and instead posits conscious and unconscious conflict among wishes (dependent, controlling, sexual, and aggressive), guilt and shame, emotions (especially anxiety and depressive affect), and defensive operations that shut off from consciousness some aspect of the others. Moreover, healthy functioning (adaptive) is also determined, to a great extent, by resolutions of conflict.

A major objective of modern conflict-theory psychoanalysis is to change the balance of conflict in a patient by making aspects of the less adaptive solutions (also called &quot;compromise formations&quot;) conscious so that they can be rethought, and more adaptive solutions found. Current theoreticians who follow the work of Charles Brenner, especially &quot;The Mind in Conflict&quot; (1982), include Sandor Abend, Jacob Arlow, and Jerome Blackman.

====Object relations theory====
&quot;Object relations theory&quot; attempts to explain human relationships through a study of how mental representations of the self and others are organized. The clinical symptoms that suggest object relations problems (typically developmental delays throughout life) include disturbances in an individual&#x27;s capacity to feel: warmth, empathy, trust, sense of security, identity stability, consistent emotional closeness, and stability in relationships with significant others.

Klein discusses the concept of introjection, creating a mental representation of external objects; and projection, applying this mental representation to reality. Wilfred Bion introduced the concept of &quot;containment&quot; of projections in the mother-child relationship where a mother understands an infants projections, modifies them and returns them to the child.

Concepts regarding internal representation (aka &#x27;introspect&#x27;, &#x27;self and object representation&#x27;, or &#x27;internalization of self and other&#x27;), although often attributed to Melanie Klein, were actually first mentioned by Sigmund Freud in his early concepts of drive theory (&quot;Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality&quot;, 1905). Freud&#x27;s 1917 paper &quot;Mourning and Melancholia&quot;, for example, hypothesized that unresolved grief was caused by the survivor&#x27;s internalized image of the deceased becoming fused with that of the survivor, and then the survivor shifting unacceptable anger toward the deceased onto the now complex self-image.

Melanie Klein&#x27;s hypotheses regarding internalization during the first year of life, leading to paranoid and depressive positions, were later challenged by René Spitz (e.g., &quot;The First Year of Life&quot;, 1965), who divided the first year of life into a coenesthetic phase of the first six months, and then a diacritic phase for the second six months. Mahler, Fine, and Bergman (1975) describe distinct phases and subphases of child development leading to &quot;separation-individuation&quot; during the first three years of life, stressing the importance of constancy of parental figures in the face of the child&#x27;s destructive aggression, internalizations, stability of affect management, and ability to develop healthy autonomy.

During adolescence, Erik Erikson (1950–1960s) described the &#x27;identity crisis&#x27;, that involves identity-diffusion anxiety. In order for an adult to be able to experience &quot;Warm-ETHICS: (warmth, Empathy, Trust, Holding environment, Identity, Closeness, and Stability) in relationships, the teenager must resolve the problems with identity and redevelop self and object constancy.

====Self psychology====

&quot;Self psychology&quot; emphasizes the development of a stable and integrated sense of self through empathic contacts with other humans, primary significant others conceived of as &#x27;selfobjects&#x27;. &quot;Selfobjects&quot; meet the developing self&#x27;s needs for mirroring, idealization, and twinship, and thereby strengthen the developing self. The process of treatment proceeds through &quot;transmuting internalizations&quot; in which the patient gradually internalizes the selfobject functions provided by the therapist.

Self psychology was proposed originally by Heinz Kohut, and has been further developed by Arnold Goldberg, Frank Lachmann, Paul and Anna Ornstein, Marian Tolpin, and others.

====Lacanian psychoanalysis====
Lacanian psychoanalysis, which integrates psychoanalysis with structural linguistics and Hegelian philosophy, is especially popular in France and parts of Latin America. Lacanian psychoanalysis is a departure from the traditional British and American psychoanalysis. Jacques Lacan frequently used the phrase &quot;retourner à Freud&quot; (&quot;return to Freud&quot;) in his seminars and writings, as he claimed that his theories were an extension of Freud&#x27;s own, contrary to those of Anna Freud, the Ego Psychology, object relations and &quot;self&quot; theories and also claims the necessity of reading Freud&#x27;s complete works, not only a part of them. Lacan&#x27;s concepts concern the &quot;mirror stage&quot;, the &quot;Real&quot;, the &quot;Imaginary&quot;, and the &quot;Symbolic&quot;, and the claim that &quot;the unconscious is structured as a language.&quot;

Though a major influence on psychoanalysis in France and parts of Latin America, Lacan and his ideas have taken longer to be translated into English and he has thus had a lesser impact on psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in the English-speaking world. In the United Kingdom and the United States, his ideas are most widely used to analyze texts in literary theory. Due to his increasingly critical stance towards the deviation from Freud&#x27;s thought, often singling out particular texts and readings from his colleagues, Lacan was excluded from acting as a training analyst in the IPA, thus leading him to create his own school in order to maintain an institutional structure for the many candidates who desired to continue their analysis with him.

====Adaptive paradigm====

The &quot;adaptive paradigm&quot; of psychotherapy develops out of the work of Robert Langs. The &quot;adaptive paradigm&quot; interprets psychic conflict primarily in terms of conscious and unconscious adaptation to reality. Langs&#x27; recent work in some measure returns to the earlier Freud, in that Langs prefers a modified version of the topographic model of the mind (conscious, preconscious, and unconscious) over the structural model (id, ego, and super-ego), including the former&#x27;s emphasis on trauma (though Langs looks to death-related traumas rather than sexual traumas). At the same time, Langs&#x27; model of the mind differs from Freud&#x27;s in that it understands the mind in terms of evolutionary biological principles.

====Relational psychoanalysis====
&quot;Relational psychoanalysis&quot; combines interpersonal psychoanalysis with object-relations theory and with inter-subjective theory as critical for mental health. It was introduced by Stephen Mitchell. Relational psychoanalysis stresses how the individual&#x27;s personality is shaped by both real and imagined relationships with others, and how these relationship patterns are re-enacted in the interactions between analyst and patient. Relational psychoanalysts have propounded their view of the necessity of helping certain detached, isolated patients, develop the capacity for &quot;mentalization&quot; associated with thinking about relationships and themselves.

==Psychopathology (mental disturbances)==
===Childhood origins===
Freudian theories hold that adult problems can be traced to unresolved conflicts from certain phases of childhood and adolescence, caused by fantasy, stemming from their own drives. Freud, based on the data gathered from his patients early in his career, suspected that neurotic disturbances occurred when children were sexually abused in childhood (i.e. &quot;seduction theory&quot;). Later, Freud came to believe that, although child abuse occurs, neurotic symptoms were not associated with this. He believed that neurotic people often had unconscious conflicts that involved incestuous fantasies deriving from different stages of development. He found the stage from about three to six years of age (preschool years, today called the &quot;first genital stage&quot;) to be filled with fantasies of having romantic relationships with both parents. Arguments were quickly generated in early 20th-century Vienna about whether adult seduction of children, i.e. child sexual abuse, was the basis of neurotic illness. There still is no complete agreement, although nowadays professionals recognize the negative effects of child sexual abuse on mental health.

The theory on origins of pathologically dysfunctional relationships was further developed by the specialist in psychiatry Jürg Willi (* 16 March 1934 in Zürich; † 8 April 2019) into the Collusion (psychology) concept. The concept takes the observations of Sigmund Freud about the narcissistic, the oral, the anal and the phallic phases and translates them into a two-couples-relationship model, with respect to dysfunctions in the relationship resulting from childhood trauma.

====Oedipal conflicts====
Many psychoanalysts who work with children have studied the actual effects of child abuse, which include ego and object relations deficits and severe neurotic conflicts. Much research has been done on these types of trauma in childhood, and the adult sequelae of those. In studying the childhood factors that start neurotic symptom development, Freud found a constellation of factors that, for literary reasons, he termed the Oedipus complex, based on the play by Sophocles, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, in which the protagonist unwittingly kills his father and marries his mother. The validity of the &quot;Oedipus complex&quot; is now widely disputed and rejected.

The shorthand term, &quot;oedipal&quot;—later explicated by Joseph J. Sandler in &quot;On the Concept Superego&quot; (1960) and modified by Charles Brenner in &quot;The Mind in Conflict&quot; (1982)—refers to the powerful attachments that children make to their parents in the preschool years. These attachments involve fantasies of sexual relationships with either (or both) parent, and, therefore, competitive fantasies toward either (or both) parents. Humberto Nagera (1975) has been particularly helpful in clarifying many of the complexities of the child through these years.

&quot;Positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; oedipal conflicts have been attached to the heterosexual and homosexual aspects, respectively. Both seem to occur in development of most children. Eventually, the developing child&#x27;s concessions to reality (that they will neither marry one parent nor eliminate the other) lead to identifications with parental values. These identifications generally create a new set of mental operations regarding values and guilt, subsumed under the term &quot;superego&quot;. Besides superego development, children &quot;resolve&quot; their preschool oedipal conflicts through channeling wishes into something their parents approve of (&quot;sublimation&quot;) and the development, during the school-age years (&quot;latency&quot;) of age-appropriate obsessive-compulsive defensive maneuvers (rules, repetitive games).

==Treatment==

Using the various analytic and psychological techniques to assess mental problems, some believe that there are particular constellations of problems that are especially suited for analytic treatment (see below) whereas other problems might respond better to medicines and other interpersonal interventions. To be treated with psychoanalysis, whatever the presenting problem, the person requesting help must demonstrate a desire to start an analysis. The person wishing to start an analysis must have some capacity for speech and communication. As well, they need to be able to have or develop trust and insight within the psychoanalytic session. Potential patients must undergo a preliminary stage of treatment to assess their amenability to psychoanalysis at that time, and also to enable the analyst to form a working psychological model, which the analyst will use to direct the treatment. Psychoanalysts mainly work with neurosis and hysteria in particular; however, adapted forms of psychoanalysis are used in working with schizophrenia and other forms of psychosis or mental disorder. Finally, if a prospective patient is severely suicidal a longer preliminary stage may be employed, sometimes with sessions which have a twenty-minute break in the middle. There are numerous modifications in technique under the heading of psychoanalysis due to the individualistic nature of personality in both analyst and patient.

The most common problems treatable with psychoanalysis include: phobias, conversions, compulsions, obsessions, anxiety attacks, depressions, sexual dysfunctions, a wide variety of relationship problems (such as dating and marital strife), and a wide variety of character problems (for example, painful shyness, meanness, obnoxiousness, workaholism, hyperseductiveness, hyperemotionality, hyperfastidiousness). The fact that many of such patients also demonstrate deficits above makes diagnosis and treatment selection difficult.

Analytical organizations such as the IPA, APsaA and the European Federation for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy have established procedures and models for the indication and practice of psychoanalytical therapy for trainees in analysis. The match between the analyst and the patient can be viewed as another contributing factor for the indication and contraindication for psychoanalytic treatment. The analyst decides whether the patient is suitable for psychoanalysis. This decision made by the analyst, besides made on the usual indications and pathology, is also based to a certain degree by the &quot;fit&quot; between analyst and patient. A person&#x27;s suitability for analysis at any particular time is based on their desire to know something about where their illness has come from. Someone who is not suitable for analysis expresses no desire to know more about the root causes of their illness.

An evaluation may include one or more other analysts&#x27; independent opinions and will include discussion of the patient&#x27;s financial situation and insurances.

===Techniques===
The foundation of psychoanalysis is interpretation of the patient&#x27;s unconscious conflicts that are interfering with current-day functioning – conflicts that are causing painful symptoms such as phobias, anxiety, depression, and compulsions. Strachey (1936) stressed that figuring out ways the patient distorted perceptions about the analyst led to understanding what may have been forgotten. In particular, unconscious hostile feelings toward the analyst could be found in symbolic, negative reactions to what Robert Langs later called the &quot;frame&quot; of the therapy—the setup that included times of the sessions, payment of fees, and necessity of talking. In patients who made mistakes, forgot, or showed other peculiarities regarding time, fees, and talking, the analyst can usually find various unconscious &quot;resistances&quot; to the flow of thoughts (aka free association).

When the patient reclines on a couch with the analyst out of view, the patient tends to remember more experiences, more resistance and transference, and is able to reorganize thoughts after the development of insight – through the interpretive work of the analyst. Although fantasy life can be understood through the examination of dreams, masturbation fantasies are also important. The analyst is interested in how the patient reacts to and avoids such fantasies. Various memories of early life are generally distorted—what Freud called &quot;screen memories&quot;—and in any case, very early experiences (before age two)—cannot be remembered.

====Variations in technique====
There is what is known among psychoanalysts as &quot;classical technique&quot;, although Freud throughout his writings deviated from this considerably, depending on the problems of any given patient.

&quot;Classical technique&quot; was summarized by Allan Compton as comprising:

* Instructions: telling the patient to try to say what&#x27;s on their mind, including interferences;
* Exploration: asking questions; and
* Clarification: rephrasing and summarizing what the patient has been describing.

As well, the analyst can also use confrontation to bringing an aspect of functioning, usually a defense, to the patient&#x27;s attention. The analyst then uses a variety of interpretation methods, such as:

* Dynamic interpretation: explaining how being too nice guards against guilt (e.g. defense vs. affect);
* Genetic interpretation: explaining how a past event is influencing the present;
* Resistance interpretation: showing the patient how they are avoiding their problems;
* Transference interpretation: showing the patient ways old conflicts arise in current relationships, including that with the analyst; or
* Dream interpretation: obtaining the patient&#x27;s thoughts about their dreams and connecting this with their current problems.

Analysts can also use reconstruction to estimate what may have happened in the past that created some current issue. These techniques are primarily based on &quot;conflict theory&quot; (see above). As &quot;object relations theory&quot; evolved, supplemented by the work of John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, techniques with patients who had more severe problems with basic trust (Erikson, 1950) and a history of maternal deprivation (see the works of Augusta Alpert) led to new techniques with adults. These have sometimes been called interpersonal, intersubjective (cf. Stolorow), relational, or corrective object relations techniques.

Ego psychological concepts of deficit in functioning led to refinements in supportive therapy. These techniques are particularly applicable to psychotic and near-psychotic (cf., Eric Marcus, &quot;Psychosis and Near-psychosis&quot;) patients. These supportive therapy techniques include discussions of reality; encouragement to stay alive (including hospitalization); psychotropic medicines to relieve overwhelming depressive affect or overwhelming fantasies (hallucinations and delusions); and advice about the meanings of things (to counter abstraction failures).

The notion of the &quot;silent analyst&quot; has been criticized. Actually, the analyst listens using Arlow&#x27;s approach as set out in &quot;The Genesis of Interpretation&quot;, using active intervention to interpret resistances, defenses creating pathology, and fantasies. Silence is not a technique of psychoanalysis (see also the studies and opinion papers of Owen Renik). &quot;Analytic neutrality&quot; is a concept that does not mean the analyst is silent. It refers to the analyst&#x27;s position of not taking sides in the internal struggles of the patient. For example, if a patient feels guilty, the analyst might explore what the patient has been doing or thinking that causes the guilt, but not reassure the patient not to feel guilty. The analyst might also explore the identifications with parents and others that led to the guilt.

Interpersonal–relational psychoanalysts emphasize the notion that it is impossible to be neutral. Sullivan introduced the term &quot;participant-observer&quot; to indicate the analyst inevitably interacts with the analysand, and suggested the detailed inquiry as an alternative to interpretation. The detailed inquiry involves noting where the analysand is leaving out important elements of an account and noting when the story is obfuscated, and asking careful questions to open up the dialogue.

===Group therapy and play therapy===
Although single-client sessions remain the norm, psychoanalytic theory has been used to develop other types of psychological treatment. Psychoanalytic group therapy was pioneered by Trigant Burrow, Joseph Pratt, Paul F. Schilder, Samuel R. Slavson, Harry Stack Sullivan, and Wolfe. Child-centered counseling for parents was instituted early in analytic history by Freud, and was later further developed by Irwin Marcus, Edith Schulhofer, and Gilbert Kliman. Psychoanalytically based couples therapy has been promulgated and explicated by Fred Sander. Techniques and tools developed in the first decade of the 21st century have made psychoanalysis available to patients who were not treatable by earlier techniques. This meant that the analytic situation was modified so that it would be more suitable and more likely to be helpful for these patients. Eagle (2007) believes that psychoanalysis cannot be a self-contained discipline but instead must be open to influence from and integration with findings and theory from other disciplines.

Psychoanalytic constructs have been adapted for use with children with treatments such as play therapy, art therapy, and storytelling. Throughout her career, from the 1920s through the 1970s, Anna Freud adapted psychoanalysis for children through play. This is still used today for children, especially those who are preadolescent. Using toys and games, children are able to symbolically demonstrate their fears, fantasies, and defenses; although not identical, this technique, in children, is analogous to the aim of free association in adults. Psychoanalytic play therapy allows the child and analyst to understand children&#x27;s conflicts, particularly defenses such as disobedience and withdrawal, that have been guarding against various unpleasant feelings and hostile wishes. In art therapy, the counselor may have a child draw a portrait and then tell a story about the portrait. The counselor watches for recurring themes—regardless of whether it is with art or toys.

===Cultural variations===
Psychoanalysis can be adapted to different cultures, as long as the therapist or counselor understands the client&#x27;s culture. For example, Tori and Blimes found that defense mechanisms were valid in a normative sample of 2,624 Thais. The use of certain defense mechanisms was related to cultural values. For example, Thais value calmness and collectiveness (because of Buddhist beliefs), so they were low on regressive emotionality. Psychoanalysis also applies because Freud used techniques that allowed him to get the subjective perceptions of his patients. He takes an objective approach by not facing his clients during his talk therapy sessions. He met with his patients wherever they were, such as when he used free association—where clients would say whatever came to mind without self-censorship. His treatments had little to no structure for most cultures, especially Asian cultures. Therefore, it is more likely that Freudian constructs will be used in structured therapy. In addition, Corey postulates that it will be necessary for a therapist to help clients develop a cultural identity as well as an ego identity.

===Psychodynamic therapy===
According to the NIH, psychodynamic therapy focuses on how an individual’s present behavior is affected by past experiences and the unconscious processes. The main goal associated with psychodynamic therapy is internal reflection; for the patient to be able to understand more about their current behaviors after self-reflection and a critical analyzation of their past with their therapist. In order for this method of treatment to be effective there must be a strong foundation of trust between the patient and their therapist. Often psychodynamic therapy requires a large time investment taking many years for considerable improvement and is not considered a quick solution.

===Cost and length of treatment===
The cost to the patient of psychoanalytic treatment ranges widely from place to place and between practitioners. Low-fee analysis is often available in a psychoanalytic training clinic and graduate schools. Otherwise, the fee set by each analyst varies with the analyst&#x27;s training and experience. Since, in most locations in the United States, unlike in Ontario and Germany, classical analysis (which usually requires sessions three to five times per week) is not covered by health insurance, many analysts may negotiate their fees with patients whom they feel they can help, but who have financial difficulties. The modifications of analysis, which include psychodynamic therapy, brief therapies, and certain types of group therapy, are carried out on a less frequent basis—usually once, twice, or three times a week – and usually the patient sits facing the therapist. As a result of the defense mechanisms and the lack of access to the unfathomable elements of the unconscious, psychoanalysis can be an expansive process that involves 2 to 5 sessions per week for several years. This type of therapy relies on the belief that reducing the symptoms will not actually help with the root causes or irrational drives. The analyst typically is a &#x27;blank screen&#x27;, disclosing very little about themselves in order that the client can use the space in the relationship to work on their unconscious without interference from outside.

The psychoanalyst uses various methods to help the patient to become more self-aware, insightful and uncover meanings of symptoms. Firstly, the psychoanalyst attempts to develop a safe and confidential atmosphere where the patient can report feelings, thoughts and fantasies. Analysands (as people in analysis are called) are asked to report whatever comes to mind without fear of reprisal. Freud called this the &quot;fundamental rule&quot;. Analysands are asked to talk about their lives, including their early life, current life and hopes and aspirations for the future. They are encouraged to report their fantasies, &quot;flash thoughts&quot; and dreams. In fact, Freud believed that dreams were, &quot;the royal road to the unconscious&quot;; he devoted an entire volume to the interpretation of dreams. Freud had his patients lay on a couch in a dimly lit room and would sit out of sight, usually directly behind them, as to not influence the patient&#x27;s thoughts by his gestures or expressions.

The psychoanalyst&#x27;s task, in collaboration with the analysand, is to help deepen the analysand&#x27;s understanding of those factors, outside of his awareness, that drive his behaviors. In the safe environment psychoanalysis offers, the analysand becomes attached to the analyst and pretty soon he begins to experience the same conflicts with his analyst that he experiences with key figures in his life such as his parents, his boss, his significant other, etc. It is the psychoanalyst&#x27;s role to point out these conflicts and to interpret them. The transferring of these internal conflicts onto the analyst is called &quot;transference&quot;.

Many studies have also been done on briefer &quot;dynamic&quot; treatments; these are more expedient to measure, and shed light on the therapeutic process to some extent. Brief Relational Therapy (BRT), Brief Psychodynamic Therapy (BPT), and Time-Limited Dynamic Therapy (TLDP) limit treatment to 20–30 sessions. On average, classical analysis may last 5.7 years, but for phobias and depressions uncomplicated by ego deficits or object relations deficits, analysis may run for a shorter period of time. Longer analyses are indicated for those with more serious disturbances in object relations, more symptoms, and more ingrained character pathology.

==Training and research==
Psychoanalysis continues to be practiced by psychiatrists, social workers, and other mental health professionals; however, its practice has declined. It has been largely replaced by the similar but broader psychodynamic psychotherapy in the mid-20th century. Psychoanalytic approaches continue to be listed by the UK National Health Service as possibly helpful for depression.

===United States===

Psychoanalytic training in the United States tends to vary according to the program, but it involves a personal psychoanalysis for the trainee, approximately 300 to 600 hours of class instruction, with a standard curriculum, over a two to five-year period.

Typically, this psychoanalysis must be conducted by a Supervising and Training Analyst. Most institutes (but not all) within the American Psychoanalytic Association, require that Supervising and Training Analysts become certified by the American Board of Psychoanalysts. Certification entails a blind review in which the psychoanalyst&#x27;s work is vetted by psychoanalysts outside of their local community. After earning certification, these psychoanalysts undergo another hurdle in which they are specially vetted by senior members of their own institute and held to the highest ethical and moral standards. Moreover, they are required to have extensive experience conducting psychoanalyses.

Candidates generally have an hour of supervision each week per psychoanalytic case. The minimum number of cases varies between institutes. Candidates often have two to four cases; both male and female cases are required. Supervision extends at least a few years on one or more cases. During supervision the trainee presents material from the psychoanalytic work that week. With the supervisor, the trainee then explores the patient&#x27;s unconscious conflicts with examination of transference-countertransference constellations.

Many psychoanalytic training centers in the United States have been accredited by special committees of the APsaA or the IPA. Because of theoretical differences, there are independent institutes, usually founded by psychologists, who until 1987 were not permitted access to psychoanalytic training institutes of the APsaA. Currently there are between 75 and 100 independent institutes in the United States. As well, other institutes are affiliated to other organizations such as the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry, and the National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis. At most psychoanalytic institutes in the United States, qualifications for entry include a terminal degree in a mental health field, such as Ph.D., Psy.D., M.S.W., or M.D. A few institutes restrict applicants to those already holding an M.D. or Ph.D., and most institutes in Southern California confer a Ph.D. or Psy.D. in psychoanalysis upon graduation, which involves completion of the necessary requirements for the state boards that confer that doctoral degree. The first training institute in America to educate non-medical psychoanalysts was The National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis (1978) in New York City. It was founded by the analyst Theodor Reik. The Contemporary Freudian (originally the New York Freudian Society) an offshoot of the National Psychological Association has a branch in Washington, DC. It is a component society/institute or the IPA.

Some psychoanalytic training has been set up as a post-doctoral fellowship in university settings, such as at Duke University, Yale University, New York University, Adelphi University and Columbia University. Other psychoanalytic institutes may not be directly associated with universities, but the faculty at those institutes usually hold contemporaneous faculty positions with psychology Ph.D. programs and/or with medical school psychiatry residency programs.

The IPA is the world&#x27;s primary accrediting and regulatory body for psychoanalysis. Their mission is to assure the continued vigor and development of psychoanalysis for the benefit of psychoanalytic patients. It works in partnership with its 70 constituent organizations in 33 countries to support 11,500 members. In the US, there are 77 psychoanalytical organizations, institutes and associations, which are spread across the states. APsaA has 38 affiliated societies which have 10 or more active members who practice in a given geographical area. The aims of APsaA and other psychoanalytical organizations are: provide ongoing educational opportunities for its members, stimulate the development and research of psychoanalysis, provide training and organize conferences. There are eight affiliated study groups in the United States. A study group is the first level of integration of a psychoanalytical body within the IPA, followed by a provisional society and finally a member society.

The Division of Psychoanalysis (39) of the American Psychological Association (APA) was established in the early 1980s by several psychologists. Until the establishment of the Division of Psychoanalysis, psychologists who had trained in independent institutes had no national organization. The Division of Psychoanalysis now has approximately 4,000 members and approximately 30 local chapters in the United States. The Division of Psychoanalysis holds two annual meetings or conferences and offers continuing education in theory, research and clinical technique, as do their affiliated local chapters. The European Psychoanalytical Federation (EPF) is the organization which consolidates all European psychoanalytic societies. This organization is affiliated with the IPA. In 2002, there were approximately 3,900 individual members in 22 countries, speaking 18 different languages. There are also 25 psychoanalytic societies.

The American Association of Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work (AAPCSW) was established by Crayton Rowe in 1980 as a division of the Federation of Clinical Societies of Social Work and became an independent entity in 1990. Until 2007 it was known as the National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis. The organization was founded because although social workers represented the larger number of people who were training to be psychoanalysts, they were underrepresented as supervisors and teachers at the institutes they attended. AAPCSW now has over 1000 members and has over 20 chapters. It holds a bi-annual national conference and numerous annual local conferences.

Experiences of psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic psychotherapists and research into infant and child development have led to new insights. Theories have been further developed and the results of empirical research are now more integrated in the psychoanalytic theory.

===United Kingdom===

The London Psychoanalytical Society was founded by Ernest Jones on 30 October 1913. After World War I with the expansion of psychoanalysis in the United Kingdom, the Society was reconstituted and named the British Psychoanalytical Society in 1919. Soon after, the Institute of Psychoanalysis was established to administer the Society&#x27;s activities. These include: the training of psychoanalysts, the development of the theory and practice of psychoanalysis, the provision of treatment through The London Clinic of Psychoanalysis, the publication of books in The New Library of Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Ideas. The Institute of Psychoanalysis also publishes &quot;The International Journal of Psychoanalysis&quot;, maintains a library, furthers research, and holds public lectures. The society has a Code of Ethics and an Ethical Committee. The society, the institute and the clinic are all located at &quot;Byron House&quot; in West London.

The Society is a constituent society of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) a body with members on all five continents which safeguards professional and ethical practice. The Society is a member of the British Psychoanalytic Council (BPC); the BPC publishes a register of British psychoanalysts and psychoanalytical psychotherapists. All members of the British Psychoanalytic Council are required to undertake continuing professional development, CPD. Members of the Society teach and hold posts on other approved psychoanalytic courses, e.g.: British Psychotherapy Foundation and in academic departments, e.g.University College London.

Members of the Society have included: Michael Balint, Wilfred Bion, John Bowlby, Ronald Fairbairn, Anna Freud, Harry Guntrip, Melanie Klein, Donald Meltzer, Joseph J. Sandler, Hanna Segal, J. D. Sutherland and Donald Winnicott.

The Institute of Psychoanalysis is the foremost publisher of psychoanalytic literature. The 24-volume &quot;Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud&quot; was conceived, translated, and produced under the direction of the British Psychoanalytical Society. The Society, in conjunction with Random House, will soon publish a new, revised and expanded Standard Edition. With the New Library of Psychoanalysis the Institute continues to publish the books of leading theorists and practitioners. &quot;The International Journal of Psychoanalysis&quot; is published by the Institute of Psychoanalysis. For over 100 years, it has one of the largest circulations of any psychoanalytic journal.

===Psychoanalytic psychotherapy===
There are different forms of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in which psychoanalytic thinking is applied. In addition to classical psychoanalysis there is for example psychoanalytic psychotherapy, an approach that expands &quot;the accessibility of psychoanalytic theory and clinical practices that had evolved over 100 plus years to a larger number of individuals.&quot; Other examples of well known therapies which also use insights of psychoanalysis are mentalization-based treatment (MBT), and transference focused psychotherapy (TFP). There is also a continuing influence of psychoanalytic thinking in mental health care and psychiatric care.

===Research===

Over a hundred years of case reports and studies in the journal &quot;Modern Psychoanalysis&quot;, the &quot;Psychoanalytic Quarterly&quot;, the &quot;International Journal of Psychoanalysis&quot; and the &quot;Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association&quot; have analyzed the efficacy of analysis in cases of neurosis and character or problems. Psychoanalysis modified by object relations techniques has been shown to be effective in many cases of ingrained problems of intimacy and relationship (cf. the many books of Otto Kernberg). Psychoanalytic treatment, in other situations, may run from about a year to many years, depending on the severity and complexity of the pathology.

Psychoanalytic theory has, from its inception, been the subject of criticism and controversy. Freud remarked on this early in his career, when other physicians in Vienna ostracized him for his findings that hysterical conversion symptoms were not limited to women. Challenges to analytic theory began with Otto Rank and Alfred Adler (turn of the 20th century), continued with behaviorists (e.g. Wolpe) into the 1940s and &#x27;50s, and have persisted (e.g. Miller). Criticisms come from those who object to the notion that there are mechanisms, thoughts or feelings in the mind that could be unconscious. Criticisms also have been leveled against the idea of &quot;infantile sexuality&quot; (the recognition that children between ages two and six imagine things about procreation). Criticisms of theory have led to variations in analytic theories, such as the work of Ronald Fairbairn, Michael Balint, and John Bowlby. In the past 30 years or so, the criticisms have centered on the issue of empirical verification. With it being difficult to substantiate the efficacy of psychoanalytic treatments in a psychiatric context.

Psychoanalysis has been used as a research tool into childhood development (cf. the journal &quot;The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child&quot;), and has developed into a flexible, effective treatment for certain mental disturbances. In the 1960s, Freud&#x27;s early (1905) thoughts on the childhood development of female sexuality were challenged; this challenge led to major research in the 1970s and 80s, and then to a reformulation of female sexual development that corrected some of Freud&#x27;s concepts. Also see the various works of Eleanor Galenson, Nancy Chodorow, Karen Horney, Françoise Dolto, Melanie Klein, Selma Fraiberg, and others. Most recently, psychoanalytic researchers who have integrated attachment theory into their work, including Alicia Lieberman and Daniel Schechter, have explored the role of parental traumatization in the development of young children&#x27;s mental representations of self and others.

==Effectiveness==
The psychoanalytic profession has been resistant to researching efficacy. Evaluations of effectiveness based on the interpretation of the therapist alone cannot be proven.

===Research results===
Numerous studies have shown that the efficacy of therapy is primarily related to the quality of the therapeutic alliance.

Meta-analyses in 2019 found psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapy effective at improving psychosocial wellbeing, reducing suicidality, as well as self harm behavior in patients at a 6-month interval. There has also been evidence for psychoanalytic psychotherapy as an effective treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Conduct Disorder when compared with behavioral management treatments with or without methylphenidate. Meta-analysis in 2012 and 2013 found support or evidence for the efficacy of psychoanalytic therapy. Other meta-analyses published in recent years showed psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy to be effective, with outcomes comparable to or greater than other kinds of psychotherapy or antidepressant drugs, but these meta-analyses have been subjected to various criticisms. In particular, the inclusion of pre/post studies rather than randomized controlled trials, and the absence of adequate comparisons with control treatments, is a serious limitation in interpreting the results. A French 2004 report from INSERM concluded that psychoanalytic therapy is less effective than other psychotherapies (including cognitive behavioral therapy) for certain diseases.

In 2011, the American Psychological Association reviewed 103 RCT comparisons between psychodynamic treatment and a non-dynamic competitor, which had been published between 1974 and 2010, and among which 63 were deemed of adequate quality. Out of 39 comparisons with an active competitor, they found that 6 psychodynamic treatments were superior, 5 were inferior, and 28 showed no difference. The study found these results promising but explicited the necessity of further good quality trials replicating positive results on specific disorders.

Meta-analyses of Short Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP) have found effect sizes (Cohen&#x27;s d) ranging from 0.34 to 0.71 compared to no treatment and was found to be slightly better than other therapies in follow up. Other reviews have found an effect size of 0.78 to 0.91 for somatoform disorders compared to no treatment and 0.69 for treating depression. A 2012 &quot;Harvard Review of Psychiatry&quot; meta-analysis of Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) found effect sizes ranging from 0.84 for interpersonal problems to 1.51 for depression. Overall ISTDP had an effect size of 1.18 compared to no treatment.

A meta-analysis of Long Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy in 2012 found an overall effect size of 0.33, which is modest. This study concluded the recovery rate following LTPP was equal to control treatments, including treatment as usual, and found the evidence for the effectiveness of LTPP to be limited and at best conflicting. Others have found effect sizes of 0.44–0.68.

According to a 2004 French review conducted by INSERM, psychoanalysis was presumed or proven effective at treating panic disorder, post-traumatic stress, and personality disorders, but did not find evidence of its effectiveness in treating schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, specific phobia, bulimia and anorexia.

A 2001 systematic review of the medical literature by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that no data exist demonstrating that psychodynamic psychotherapy is effective in treating schizophrenia and severe mental illness, and cautioned that medication should always be used alongside any type of talk therapy in schizophrenia cases. A French review from 2004 found the same. The Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team advises against the use of psychodynamic therapy in cases of schizophrenia, arguing that more trials are necessary to verify its effectiveness.

==Criticism==

Both Freud and psychoanalysis have been criticized in extreme terms. Exchanges between critics and defenders of psychoanalysis have often been so heated that they have come to be characterized as the Freud Wars. Linguist Noam Chomsky has criticized psychoanalysis for lacking a scientific basis. Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould considered psychoanalysis influenced by pseudoscientific theories such as recapitulation theory. Psychologists Hans Eysenck, John F. Kihlstrom, and others have also criticized the field as pseudoscience.

===Debate over status as scientific===
The theoretical foundations of psychoanalysis lie in the same philosophical currents that lead to interpretive phenomenology rather than in those that lead to scientific positivism, making the theory largely incompatible with positivist approaches to the study of the mind.

Early critics of psychoanalysis believed that its theories were based too little on quantitative and experimental research and too much on the clinical case study method. Philosopher Frank Cioffi cites false claims of a sound scientific verification of the theory and its elements as the strongest basis for classifying the work of Freud and his school as pseudoscience.

Karl Popper argued that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience because its claims are not testable and cannot be refuted; that is, they are not falsifiable:In addition, Imre Lakatos wrote that &quot;Freudians have been nonplussed by Popper&#x27;s basic challenge concerning scientific honesty. Indeed, they have refused to specify experimental conditions under which they would give up their basic assumptions.&quot; In &quot;Sexual Desire&quot; (1986), philosopher Roger Scruton rejects Popper&#x27;s arguments, pointing to the theory of repression as an example of a Freudian theory that does have testable consequences. Scruton nevertheless concluded that psychoanalysis is not genuinely scientific because it involves an unacceptable dependence on metaphor. The philosopher and physicist Mario Bunge argued that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience because it violates the ontology and methodology inherent to science. According to Bunge, most psychoanalytic theories are either untestable or unsupported by evidence.

Cognitive scientists, in particular, have also weighed in. Martin Seligman, a prominent academic in positive psychology, wrote that:Adolf Grünbaum argues in &quot;Validation in the Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis&quot; (1993) that psychoanalytic-based theories are falsifiable but that the causal claims of psychoanalysis are unsupported by the available clinical evidence.

Historian Henri Ellenberger, who researched the history of Freud, Jung, Adler, and Janet, while writing his book &quot;The Discovery of the Unconscious: The History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry&quot;, argued that psychoanalysis was not scientific on the grounds of both its methodology and social structure:
===Freud===
Some have accused Freud of fabrication, most famously in the case of Anna O. Others have speculated that patients had conditions that are now easily identifiable and unrelated to psychoanalysis; for instance, Anna O. is thought to have had an organic impairment such as tuberculous meningitis or temporal lobe epilepsy, rather than Freud&#x27;s diagnosis of hysteria.

Henri Ellenberger and Frank Sulloway argue that Freud and his followers created an inaccurate legend of Freud to popularize psychoanalysis. Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and Sonu Shamdasani argue that this legend has been adapted to different times and situations. Isabelle Stengers states that psychoanalytic circles have tried to stop historians from accessing documents about the life of Freud.

===Witch doctors===
Richard Feynman wrote off psychoanalysts as mere &quot;witch doctors&quot;:

Likewise, psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey, in &quot;Witchdoctors and Psychiatrists&quot; (1986), agreed that psychoanalytic theories have no more scientific basis than the theories of traditional native healers, &quot;witchdoctors&quot; or modern &quot;cult&quot; alternatives such as EST. Psychologist Alice Miller charged psychoanalysis with being similar to the poisonous pedagogies, which she described in her book &quot;For Your Own Good&quot;. She scrutinized and rejected the validity of Freud&#x27;s drive theory, including the Oedipus complex, which, according to her and Jeffrey Masson, blames the child for the abusive sexual behavior of adults. Psychologist Joel Kupfersmid investigated the validity of the Oedipus complex, examining its nature and origins. He concluded that there is little evidence to support the existence of the Oedipus complex.

===Critical perspectives===

Contemporary French philosophers Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze asserted that the institution of psychoanalysis has become a center of power and that its confessional techniques resemble those included and utilized within the Christian religion. Their most in-depth criticism of the power structure of psychoanalysis and its connivance with capitalism are found in &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; (1972) and &quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot; (1980), the two volumes of their theoretical work &quot;Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot;. In &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot;, Deleuze and Guattari take the cases of Gérard Mendel, Bela Grunberger, and Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, prominent members of the most respected psychoanalytical associations (including the IPA), to suggest that, traditionally, psychoanalysis had always enthusiastically enjoyed and embraced a police state throughout its history.

French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan criticized the emphasis of some American and British psychoanalytical traditions on what he viewed as the suggestion of imaginary &quot;causes&quot; for symptoms and recommended the return to Freud.

Belgian psycholinguist and psychoanalyst Luce Irigaray also criticized psychoanalysis, employing Jacques Derrida&#x27;s concept of phallogocentrism to describe the exclusion of the woman both from Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalytical theories.

===Freudian theory===

A survey of scientific research suggested that while personality traits corresponding to Freud&#x27;s oral, anal, Oedipal, and genital phases can be observed, they do not necessarily manifest as stages in the development of children. These studies also have not confirmed that such adult traits result from childhood experiences. However, these stages should not be considered crucial to modern psychoanalysis. The power of the unconscious and the transference phenomenon is vital to contemporary psychoanalytic theory and practice.

The idea of &quot;unconscious&quot; is contested because human behavior can be observed while human mental activity has to be inferred. However, the unconscious is now a popular topic of study in the fields of experimental and social psychology (e.g., implicit attitude measures, fMRI, PET scans, and other indirect tests). The idea of unconscious and the transference phenomenon have been widely researched and, it is claimed, validated in the fields of cognitive psychology and social psychology, though the majority of cognitive psychologists does not hold a Freudian interpretation of unconscious mental activity. Recent developments in neuroscience have resulted in one side arguing that it has provided a biological basis for unconscious emotional processing in line with psychoanalytic theory (i.e., neuropsychoanalysis), while the other side argues that such findings make psychoanalytic theory obsolete and irrelevant.

Shlomo Kalo explains that the scientific materialism that flourished in the 19th century severely harmed religion and rejected whatever was called spiritual. The institution of the confession priest in particular was badly damaged. The empty void that the newborn psychoanalysis swiftly occupied this institution left behind. In his writings, Kalo claims that psychoanalysis&#x27;s basic approach is erroneous. It represents the mainline wrong assumptions that happiness is unreachable and that the natural desire of a human being is to exploit his fellow men for his own pleasure and benefit.

Jacques Derrida incorporated aspects of psychoanalytic theory into his theory of deconstruction in order to question what he called the &#x27;metaphysics of presence&#x27;. Derrida also turns some of these ideas against Freud to reveal tensions and contradictions in his work. For example, although Freud defines religion and metaphysics as displacements of the identification with the father in the resolution of the Oedipal complex, Derrida (1987) insists that the prominence of the father in Freud&#x27;s own analysis is itself indebted to the prominence given to the father in Western metaphysics and theology since Plato.

<text>Hanyu Pinyin, or simply pinyin, officially the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet, is the most common romanization system for Standard Chinese. &quot;Hanyu&quot; () literally means &#x27;Han language&#x27;—that is, the Chinese language—while &quot;pinyin&quot; literally means &#x27;spelled sounds&#x27;. Pinyin is the official romanization system used in China, Singapore, Taiwan, and by the United Nations. Its use has become common when transliterating Standard Chinese mostly regardless of region, though it is less ubiquitous in Taiwan. It is used to teach Standard Chinese, normally written with Chinese characters, to students in mainland China and Singapore. Pinyin is also used by various input methods on computers and to categorize entries in some Chinese dictionaries.

In pinyin, each Chinese syllable is spelled in terms of an optional initial and a final, each of which is represented by one or more letters. Initials are initial consonants, whereas finals are all possible combinations of medials (semivowels coming before the vowel), a nucleus vowel, and coda (final vowel or consonant). Diacritics are used to indicate the four tones found in Standard Chinese, though these are often omitted in various contexts, such as when spelling Chinese names in non-Chinese texts.

Hanyu Pinyin was developed in the 1950s by a group of Chinese linguists including Wang Li, Lu Zhiwei, Li Jinxi, Luo Changpei and Zhou Youguang, who has been called the &quot;father of pinyin&quot;. They based their work in part on earlier romanization systems. The system was originally promulgated at the Fifth Session of the 1st National People&#x27;s Congress in 1958, and has seen several rounds of revisions since. The International Organization for Standardization propagated Hanyu Pinyin as ISO 7098 in 1982, and the United Nations began using it in 1986. Taiwan adopted Hanyu Pinyin as its official romanization system in 2009, replacing Tongyong Pinyin.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Matteo Ricci, a Jesuit missionary in China, wrote the first book that used the Latin alphabet to write Chinese, entitled &quot;Xizi Qiji&quot; () and published in Beijing in 1605. Twenty years later, fellow Jesuit Nicolas Trigault published ) in Hangzhou. Neither book had any influence among the contemporary Chinese literati, and the romanizations they introduced primarily were useful for Westerners.

During the late Qing, the reformer Song Shu (1862–1910) proposed that China adopt a phonetic writing system. A student of the scholars Yu Yue and Zhang Taiyan, Song had observed the effect of the &quot;kana&quot; syllabaries and Western learning during his visits to Japan. While Song did not himself propose a transliteration system for Chinese, his discussion ultimately led to a proliferation of proposed schemes. The Wade–Giles system was produced by Thomas Wade in 1859, and further improved by Herbert Giles, presented in &quot;Chinese–English Dictionary&quot; (1892). It was popular, and was used in English-language publications outside China until 1979. In 1943, the US military tapped Yale University to develop another romanization system for Mandarin Chinese intended for pilots flying over China—much more than previous systems, the result appears very similar to modern Hanyu Pinyin.

===Development===
Hanyu Pinyin was designed by a group of mostly Chinese linguists, including Wang Li, Lu Zhiwei, Li Jinxi, Luo Changpei, as well as Zhou Youguang (1906–2017), an economist by trade, as part of a Chinese government project in the 1950s. Zhou, often called &quot;the father of pinyin&quot;, worked as a banker in New York when he decided to return to China to help rebuild the country after the People&#x27;s Republic was established. Earlier attempts to romanize Chinese writing were mostly abandoned in 1944. Zhou became an economics professor in Shanghai, and when the Ministry of Education created the Committee for the Reform of the Chinese Written Language in 1955, Premier Zhou Enlai assigned him the task of developing a new romanization system, despite the fact that he was not a linguist by trade.

Hanyu Pinyin incorporated different aspects from existing systems, including Gwoyeu Romatzyh (1928), Latinxua Sin Wenz (1931), and the diacritics from bopomofo (1918). &quot;I&#x27;m not the father of pinyin&quot;, Zhou said years later; &quot;I&#x27;m the son of pinyin. It&#x27;s [the result of] a long tradition from the later years of the Qing dynasty down to today. But we restudied the problem and revisited it and made it more perfect.&quot;

An initial draft was authored in January 1956 by Ye Laishi, Lu Zhiwei and Zhou Youguang. A revised Pinyin scheme was proposed by Wang Li, Lu Zhiwei and Li Jinxi, and became the main focus of discussion among the group of Chinese linguists in June 1956, forming the basis of Pinyin standard later after incorporating a wide range of feedback and further revisions. The first edition of Hanyu Pinyin was approved and officially adopted at the Fifth Session of the 1st National People&#x27;s Congress on 11 February 1958. It was then introduced to primary schools as a way to teach Standard Chinese pronunciation and used to improve the literacy rate among adults.

Despite its formal promulgation, pinyin did not become widely used until after the tumult of the Cultural Revolution. In the 1980s, students were trained in pinyin from an early age, learning it in tandem with characters or even before.

During the height of the Cold War the use of pinyin system over Wade–Giles and Yale romanizations outside of China was regarded as a political statement or identification with the mainland Chinese government. Beginning in the early 1980s, Western publications addressing mainland China began using the Hanyu Pinyin romanization system instead of earlier romanization systems; this change followed the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the United States and China in 1979. In 2001, the Chinese government issued the &quot;National Common Language Law&quot;, providing a legal basis for applying pinyin. The current specification of the orthography is GB/T 16159–2012.

== Syllables ==
Chinese phonology is generally described in terms of sound pairs of two initials () and finals (). This is distinct from the concept of consonant and vowel sounds as basic units in traditional (and most other phonetic systems used to describe the Chinese language). Every syllable in Standard Chinese can be described as a pair of one initial and one final, except for the special syllable &quot;er&quot; or when a trailing &quot;-r&quot; is considered part of a syllable (a phenomenon known as &quot;erhua&quot;). The latter case, though a common practice in some sub-dialects, is rarely used in official publications.

Even though most initials contain a consonant, finals are not always simple vowels, especially in compound finals (), i.e. when a &quot;medial&quot; is placed in front of the final. For example, the medials and are pronounced with such tight openings at the beginning of a final that some native Chinese speakers (especially when singing) pronounce , officially pronounced , as and , officially pronounced , as or . Often these medials are treated as separate from the finals rather than as part of them; this convention is followed in the chart of finals below.

=== Initials ===
The conventional lexicographical order derived from bopomofo is:
In each cell below, the pinyin letters assigned to each initial are accompanied by their phonetic realizations in brackets, notated according to the International Phonetic Alphabet.

=== Finals ===

In each cell below, the first line indicates the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription, the second indicates pinyin for a standalone (no-initial) form, and the third indicates pinyin for a combination with an initial. Other than finals modified by an &quot;-r&quot;, which are omitted, the following is an exhaustive table of all possible finals.

The only syllable-final consonants in Standard Chinese are &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-ng&quot;, and &quot;-r&quot;, the last of which is attached as a grammatical suffix. A Chinese syllable ending with any other consonant either is from a non-Mandarin language (a southern Chinese language such as Cantonese, reflecting final consonants in Old Chinese), or indicates the use of a non-pinyin romanization system, such as one that uses final consonants to indicate tones. 

Technically, &quot;i, u, ü&quot; without a following vowel are finals, not medials, and therefore take the tone marks, but they are more concisely displayed as above. In addition, &quot;ê&quot; () and syllabic nasals &quot;m&quot; (, ), &quot;n&quot; (, ), &quot;ng&quot; (, ) are used as interjections or in neologisms; for example, pinyin defines the names of several pinyin letters using &quot;-ê&quot; finals.

According to the &quot;Scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet&quot;, &quot;ng&quot; can be abbreviated with the shorthand &quot;ŋ&quot;. However, this shorthand is rarely used due to difficulty of entering it on computers.

==== The sound ====
An umlaut is added to when it occurs after the initials and when necessary in order to represent the sound . This is necessary in order to distinguish the front high rounded vowel in (e.g. ) from the back high rounded vowel in (e.g. ). Tonal markers are placed above the umlaut, as in .

However, the &quot;ü&quot; is &quot;not&quot; used in the other contexts where it could represent a front high rounded vowel, namely after the letters &quot;j&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;y&quot;. For example, the sound of the word for is transcribed in pinyin simply as , not as *. This practice is opposed to Wade–Giles, which always uses &quot;ü&quot;, and Tongyong Pinyin, which always uses &quot;yu&quot;. Whereas Wade–Giles needs the umlaut to distinguish between &quot;chü&quot; (pinyin ) and &quot;chu&quot; (pinyin ), this ambiguity does not arise with pinyin, so the more convenient form &quot;ju&quot; is used instead of &quot;jü&quot;. Genuine ambiguities only happen with &quot;nu&quot;/&quot;nü&quot; and &quot;lu&quot;/&quot;lü&quot;, which are then distinguished by an umlaut.

Many fonts or output methods do not support an umlaut for &quot;ü&quot; or cannot place tone marks on top of &quot;ü&quot;. Likewise, using &quot;ü&quot; in input methods is difficult because it is not present as a simple key on many keyboard layouts. For these reasons &quot;v&quot; is sometimes used instead by convention. For example, it is common for cellphones to use &quot;v&quot; instead of &quot;ü&quot;. Additionally, some stores in China use &quot;v&quot; instead of &quot;ü&quot; in the transliteration of their names. The drawback is a lack of precomposed characters and limited font support for combining accents on the letter &quot;v&quot;, ().

This also presents a problem in transcribing names for use on passports, affecting people with names that consist of the sound or , particularly people with the surname , a fairly common surname, particularly compared to the surnames , , and . Previously, the practice varied among different passport issuing offices, with some transcribing as &quot;LV&quot; and &quot;NV&quot; while others used &quot;LU&quot; and &quot;NU&quot;. On 10 July 2012, the Ministry of Public Security standardized the practice to use &quot;LYU&quot; and &quot;NYU&quot; in passports.

Although &quot;nüe&quot; written as &quot;nue&quot;, and &quot;lüe&quot; written as &quot;lue&quot; are not ambiguous, &quot;nue&quot; or &quot;lue&quot; are not correct according to the rules; &quot;nüe&quot; and &quot;lüe&quot; should be used instead. However, some Chinese input methods support both &quot;nve&quot;/&quot;lve&quot; (typing &quot;v&quot; for &quot;ü&quot;) and &quot;nue&quot;/&quot;lue&quot;.

==Tones==

The pinyin system also uses four diacritics to mark the tones of Mandarin. In the pinyin system, four main tones of Mandarin are shown by diacritics: ā, á, ǎ, and à. There is no symbol or diacritic for the neutral tone: a. The diacritic is placed over the letter that represents the syllable nucleus, unless that letter is missing. Tones are used in Hanyu Pinyin symbols, and they do not appear in Chinese characters.

Tones are written on the finals of Chinese pinyin. If the tone mark is written over an &quot;i&quot;, then it replaces the tittle, as in .
# The first tone (flat or high-level tone) is represented by a macron added to the pinyin vowel:
#: ā ē ê̄ ī ō ū ǖ Ā Ē Ê̄ Ī Ō Ū Ǖ
# The second tone (rising or high-rising tone) is denoted by an acute accent :
#: á é ế í ó ú ǘ Á É Ế Í Ó Ú Ǘ
# The third tone (falling-rising or low tone) is marked by a caron :
#: ǎ ě ê̌ ǐ ǒ ǔ ǚ Ǎ Ě Ê̌ Ǐ Ǒ Ǔ Ǚ
# The fourth tone (falling or high-falling tone) is represented by a grave accent :
#: à è ề ì ò ù ǜ À È Ề Ì Ò Ù Ǜ
# The fifth tone (neutral tone) is represented by a normal vowel without any accent mark:
#: a e ê i o u ü A E Ê I O U Ü
In dictionaries, neutral tone may be indicated by a dot preceding the syllable—e.g. . When a neutral tone syllable has an alternative pronunciation in another tone, a combination of tone marks may be used: may be pronounced either or .

=== Numbers ===

Before the advent of computers, many typewriter fonts did not contain vowels with macron or caron diacritics. Tones were thus represented by placing a tone number at the end of individual syllables. For example, is written . Each tone can be denoted with its numeral the order listed above. The neutral tone can either be denoted with no numeral, with 0, or with 5.
=== Placement and omission ===
Briefly, tone marks should always be placed in the order , with the only exceptions being and where the tone mark is placed on the second vowel instead. Pinyin tone marks appear primarily above the syllable nucleus—e.g. as in , where &quot;k&quot; is the initial, &quot;u&quot; the medial, &quot;a&quot; the nucleus, and &quot;i&quot; is the coda. There is an exception for syllabic nasals like , where the nucleus of the syllable is a consonant: there, the diacritic will be carried by a written dummy vowel.

When the nucleus is (written &quot;e&quot; or &quot;o&quot;), and there is both a medial and a coda, the nucleus may be dropped from writing. In this case, when the coda is a consonant &quot;n&quot; or &quot;ng&quot;, the only vowel left is the medial &quot;i, u&quot;, or &quot;ü&quot;, and so this takes the diacritic. However, when the coda is a vowel, it is the coda rather than the medial which takes the diacritic in the absence of a written nucleus. This occurs with syllables ending in (from : → ) and in (from : → ). That is, in the absence of a written nucleus the finals have priority for receiving the tone marker, as long as they are vowels; if not, the medial takes the diacritic.

An algorithm to find the correct vowel letter (when there is more than one) is as follows:
# If there is an &quot;a&quot; or an &quot;e&quot;, it will take the tone mark
# If there is an , then the &quot;o&quot; takes the tone mark
# Otherwise, the second vowel takes the tone mark

Worded differently,
# If there is an &quot;a, e&quot;, or &quot;o&quot;, it will take the tone mark; in the case of , the mark goes on the &quot;a&quot;
# Otherwise, the vowels are or , in which case the second vowel takes the tone mark

The above can be summarized as the following table. The vowel letter taking the tone mark is indicated by the fourth-tone mark.

=== Tone sandhi ===
Tone sandhi is not ordinarily reflected in pinyin spelling.

== Spacing, capitalization, and punctuation ==
Standard Chinese has many polysyllabic words. Like in other writing systems using the Latin alphabet, spacing in pinyin is officially based on word boundaries. However, there are often ambiguities in partitioning a word. &quot;The Basic Rules of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Orthography&quot; were put into effect in 1988 by the National Educational and National Language commissions. These rules became a GB recommendation in 1996, and were last updated in 2012.

In practice, however, published materials in China now often space pinyin syllable by syllable. According to Victor H. Mair, this practice became widespread after the Script Reform Committee, previously under direct control of the State Council, had its power greatly weakened in 1985 when it was renamed the State Language Commission and placed under the Ministry of Education. Mair claims that proponents of Chinese characters in the educational bureaucracy &quot;became alarmed that word-based pinyin was becoming a de facto alternative to Chinese characters as a script for writing Mandarin and demanded that all pinyin syllables be written separately.&quot;

== Comparison with other orthographies ==
Pinyin superseded older romanization systems such as Wade–Giles and postal romanization, and replaced bopomofo as the method of Chinese phonetic instruction in mainland China. The ISO adopted pinyin as the standard romanization for modern Chinese in 1982 (ISO 7098:1982, superseded by ISO 7098:2015). The United Nations followed suit in 1986. It has also been accepted by the government of Singapore, the United States&#x27;s Library of Congress, the American Library Association, and many other international institutions.
Pinyin assigns some Latin letters sound values which are quite different from those of most languages. This has drawn some criticism as it may lead to confusion when uninformed speakers apply either native or English assumed pronunciations to words. However, this problem is not limited only to pinyin, since many languages that use the Latin alphabet natively also assign different values to the same letters. A recent study on Chinese writing and literacy concluded, &quot;By and large, pinyin represents the Chinese sounds better than the Wade–Giles system, and does so with fewer extra marks.&quot;

As pinyin is a phonetic writing system for modern Standard Chinese, it is not designed to replace characters for writing Literary Chinese, the standard written language prior to the early 20th century. In particular, Chinese characters retain semantic cues that help distinguish differently pronounced words in the ancient classical language that are now homophones in Mandarin. Thus, Chinese characters remain indispensable for recording and transmitting the corpus of Chinese writing from the past.

Pinyin is not designed to transcribe varieties other than Standard Chinese, which is based on the phonological system of Beijing Mandarin. Other romanization schemes have been devised to transcribe those other Chinese varieties, such as Jyutping for Cantonese and Pe̍h-ōe-jī for Hokkien.

=== Comparison charts ===
== Typography and encoding ==
Based on the &quot;Chinese Romanization&quot; section of ISO 7098:2015, pinyin tone marks should use the symbols from Combining Diacritical Marks, as opposed by the use of Spacing Modifier Letters in bopomofo. Lowercase letters with tone marks are included in GB 2312 and their uppercase counterparts are included in JIS X 0212; thus Unicode includes all the common accented characters from pinyin. Other punctuation mark and symbols in Chinese are to use the equivalent symbol in English noted in to GB 15834.

According to GB 16159, all accented letters are required to have both uppercase and lowercase characters as per their normal counterparts.
GBK has mapped two characters and to Private Use Areas in Unicode respectively, thus some fonts (e.g. SimSun) that adhere to GBK include both characters in the Private Use Areas, and some input methods (e.g. Sogou Pinyin) also outputs the Private Use Areas code point instead of the original character. As the superset GB 18030 changed the mappings of and , this has caused an issue where the input methods and font files use different encoding standards, and thus the input and output of both characters are mixed up.
Other symbols are used in pinyin are as follows:
== Usage ==
The spelling of Chinese geographical or personal names in pinyin has become the most common way to transcribe them in English. Pinyin has also become the dominant Chinese input method in mainland China, in contrast to Taiwan, where bopomofo is most commonly used.

Families outside of Taiwan who speak Mandarin as a mother tongue use pinyin to help children associate characters with spoken words which they already know. Children start to learn it in kindergarten, but pinyin disappears from textbooks after primary school. Chinese families outside of Taiwan who speak some other language as their mother tongue use the system to teach children Mandarin pronunciation when learning vocabulary in elementary school.

Since 1958, pinyin has been actively used in adult education as well, making it easier for formerly illiterate people to continue with self-study after a short period of pinyin literacy instruction.

Pinyin has become a tool for many foreigners to learn Mandarin pronunciation, and is used to explain both the grammar and spoken Mandarin coupled with Chinese characters. Books containing both Chinese characters and pinyin are often used by foreign learners of Chinese. Pinyin&#x27;s role in teaching pronunciation to foreigners and children is similar in some respects to &quot;furigana&quot;-based books with &quot;hiragana&quot; letters written alongside kanji (directly analogous to bopomofo) in Japanese, or fully vocalized texts in Arabic.

The tone-marking diacritics are commonly omitted in popular news stories and even in scholarly works, as well as in the traditional Mainland Chinese Braille system, which is similar to pinyin, but meant for blind readers. This results in some degree of ambiguity as to which words are being represented.

=== Computer input ===
Simple computer systems, sometimes only able to use simple character systems for text, such as the 7-bit ASCII standard—essentially the 26 Latin letters, 10 digits, and punctuation marks—long provided a convincing argument for using unaccented pinyin instead of diacritical pinyin or Chinese characters. Today, however, most computer systems are able to display characters from Chinese and many other writing systems as well, and have them entered with a Latin keyboard using an input method editor. Alternatively, some touchscreen devices allow users to input characters graphically by writing with a stylus, with concurrent online handwriting recognition.

Pinyin with accents can be entered with the use of special keyboard layouts or various other utilities.

=== Sorting techniques ===

Chinese text can be sorted by its pinyin representation, which is often useful for looking up words whose pronunciations are known, but not whose character forms are not known. Chinese characters and words can be sorted for convenient lookup by their Pinyin expressions alphabetically, according to their inherited order originating with the ancient Phoenicians. Identical syllables are then further sorted by tone number, ascending, with neutral tones placed last.

Words of multiple characters can be sorted in two different ways, either per character, as is used in the &quot;Xiandai Hanyu Cidian&quot;, or by the whole word&#x27;s string, which is only then sorted by tone. This method is used in the &quot;ABC Chinese–English Dictionary&quot;.

=== By region ===
==== Taiwan ====

Between October 2002 and January 2009, Taiwan used Tongyong Pinyin, a domestic modification of Hanyu Pinyin, as its official romanization system. Thereafter, it began to promote the use of Hanyu Pinyin instead. Tongyong Pinyin was designed to romanize varieties spoken on the island in addition to Standard Chinese. The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party resisted its adoption, preferring the system by then used in mainland China and internationally. Romanization preferences quickly became associated with issues of national identity. Preferences split along party lines: the KMT and its affiliated parties in the Pan-Blue Coalition supported the use of Hanyu Pinyin while the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its allies in the Pan-Green Coalition favored the use of Tongyong Pinyin.

Today, many street signs in Taiwan use Tongyong Pinyin or derived romanizations, but some use Hanyu Pinyin–derived romanizations. It is not unusual to see spellings on street signs and buildings derived from the older Wade–Giles, MPS2 and other systems. Attempts to make Hanyu Pinyin standard in Taiwan have had uneven success, with most place and proper names remaining unaffected, including all major cities. Personal names on Taiwanese passports honor the choices of Taiwanese citizens, who can choose Wade–Giles, Hakka, Hoklo, Tongyong, aboriginal, or pinyin. Official use of pinyin is controversial, as when pinyin use for a metro line in 2017 provoked protests, despite government responses that &quot;The romanization used on road signs and at transportation stations is intended for foreigners... Every foreigner learning Mandarin learns Hanyu pinyin, because it is the international standard...The decision has nothing to do with the nation&#x27;s self-determination or any ideologies, because the key point is to ensure that foreigners can read signs.&quot;

==== Singapore ====

Singapore implemented Hanyu Pinyin as the official romanization system for Mandarin in the public sector starting in the 1980s, in conjunction with the Speak Mandarin Campaign. Hanyu Pinyin is also used as the romanization system to teach Mandarin Chinese at schools. While adoption has been mostly successful in government communication, placenames, and businesses established in the 1980s and onward, it continues to be unpopular in some areas, most notably for personal names and vocabulary borrowed from other varieties of Chinese already established in the local vernacular. In these situations, romanization continues to be based on the Chinese language variety it originated from, especially the three largest Chinese varieties traditionally spoken in Singapore: Hokkien, Teochew, and Cantonese.

=== Special names ===

In accordance to the &quot;Regulation of Phonetic Transcription in Hanyu Pinyin Letters of Place Names in Minority Nationality Languages&quot; () promulgated in 1976, place names in non-Han languages like Mongolian, Uyghur, and Tibetan are also officially transcribed using pinyin in a system adopted by the State Administration of Surveying and Mapping and Geographical Names Committee known as SASM/GNC romanization. The pinyin letters (26 Roman letters, plus and ) are used to approximate the non-Han language in question as closely as possible. This results in spellings that are different from both the customary spelling of the place name, and the pinyin spelling of the name in Chinese:

<doc id="23589" wikidata="Q1289917" url="?curid=23589" title="Parable of the Pearl">
<text>The Parable of the Pearl (also called the Pearl of Great Price) is one of the parables of Jesus Christ. It appears in Matthew 13 and illustrates the great value of the Kingdom of Heaven.

This is the penultimate parable in Matthew 13, coming just before the Parable of the Dragnet. It immediately follows the Parable of the Hidden Treasure, which has a similar theme. It does not appear in the other synoptic gospels, but a version of this parable does appear in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas, Saying 76. The parable has been depicted by artists such as Domenico Fetti.

The parable reads as follows:
==Interpretation==

This parable is generally interpreted as illustrating the great value of the Kingdom of Heaven. Theologian E. H. Plumptre, in Anglican bishop Charles Ellicott&#x27;s &quot;Commentary&quot;, notes that:
&quot;the caprices of luxury in the Roman empire had given a prominence to pearls, as an article of commerce, which they had never had before, and have probably never had since. They, rather than emeralds and sapphires, were the typical instance of all costliest adornments. The story of Cleopatra and the fact that the opening of a new pearl market was one of the alleged motives which led the Emperor Claudius to invade Britain, are indications of the value that was then set on the &#x27;goodly pearls&#x27; of the parable.&quot; 
Theologian John Nolland likewise notes that pearls at that time had a greater value than they do today, and it thus has a similar theme to its partner, the parable of the hidden treasure. Nolland comments that it shares with that parable the notions of &quot;good fortune and demanding action in attaining the kingdom of heaven&quot; but adds in this case the notion of &quot;diligent seeking&quot;. The valuable pearl is the &quot;deal of a lifetime&quot; for the merchant in the story. However, those who do not believe in the kingdom of heaven enough to stake their whole future on it are unworthy of the kingdom.

This interpretation of the parable is the inspiration for a number of hymns, including the anonymous Swedish hymn &quot;Den Kostliga Pärlan&quot; (&quot;O That Pearl of Great Price!&quot;), which begins:

&lt;poem&gt;
O that Pearl of great price! have you found it?
Is the Savior supreme in your love?
O consider it well, ere you answer,
As you hope for a welcome above.
Have you given up all for this Treasure?
Have you counted past gains as but loss?
Has your trust in yourself and your merits
Come to naught before Christ and His cross?
&lt;/poem&gt;

A less common interpretation of the parable is that the merchant represents Jesus, and the pearl represents the Christian Church, though that definition is problematic as neither the Christian church nor Christianity existed until after Jesus&#x27; death. This interpretation would give the parable a similar theme to that of the Parable of the Lost Sheep, the Lost Coin, and the Prodigal Son. Pope Pius XII used the phrase to describe virginity. 

==Commentary from the Church Fathers==
John Chrysostom: &quot;The Gospel preaching not only offers manifold gain as a treasure, but is precious as a pearl; wherefore after the parable concerning the treasure, He gives that concerning the pearl. And in preaching, two things are required, namely, to be detached from the business of this life, and to be watchful, which are denoted by this merchantman. Truth moreover is one, and not manifold, and for this reason it is one pearl that is said to be found. And as one who is possessed of a pearl, himself indeed knows of his wealth, but is not known to others, ofttimes concealing it in his hand because of its small bulk, so it is in the preaching of the Gospel; they who possess it know that they are rich, the unbelievers, not knowing of this treasure, know not of our wealth.&quot;

Jerome: &quot;By the goodly pearls may be understood the Law and the Prophets. Hear then Marcion and Manichæus; the good pearls are the Law and the Prophets. One pearl, the most precious of all, is the knowledge of the Saviour and the sacrament of His passion and resurrection, which when the merchantman has found, like Paul the Apostle, he straightway despises all the mysteries of the Law and the Prophets and the old observances in which he had lived blameless, counting them as dung that he may win Christ (Phillipians 3:8.) Not that the finding of a new pearl is the condemnation of the old pearls, but that in comparison of that, all other pearls are worthless.&quot;

Gregory the Great: &quot;Or by the pearl of price is to be understood the sweetness of the heavenly kingdom, which, he that hath found it, selleth all and buyeth. For he that, as far as is permitted, has had perfect knowledge of the sweetness of the heavenly life, readily leaves all things that he has loved on earth; all that once pleased him among earthly possessions now appears to have lost its beauty, for the splendour of that precious pearl is alone seen in his mind.&quot;

Augustine: &quot;Or, A man seeking goodly pearls has found one pearl of great price; that is, he who is seeking good men with whom he may live profitably, finds one alone, Christ Jesus, without sin; or, seeking precepts of life, by aid of which he may dwell righteously among men, finds love of his neighbour, in which one rule, the Apostle says, (Romans 13:9) are comprehended all things; or, seeking good thoughts, he finds that Word in which all things are contained, In the beginning was the Word (John 1:1) which is lustrous with the light of truth, stedfast with the strength of eternity, and throughout like to itself with the beauty of divinity, and when we have penetrated the shell of the flesh, will be confessed as God. But whichever of these three it may be, or if there be anything else that can occur to us, that can be signified under the figure of the one precious pearl, its preciousness is the possession of ourselves, who are not free to possess it unless we despise all things that can be possessed in this world. For having sold our possessions, we receive no other return greater than ourselves, (for while we were involved in such things we were not our own,) that we may again give ourselves for that pearl, not because we are of equal value to that, but because we cannot give anything more.&quot;

==Gospel of Thomas==
A version of the parable appears in the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas (Saying 76):
This work&#x27;s version of the parable of the hidden treasure appears later (Saying 109), rather than immediately preceding, as in Matthew. However, the mention of a treasure in Saying 76 may reflect a source for the Gospel of Thomas in which the parables were adjacent, so that the original pair of parables has been &quot;broken apart, placed in separate contexts, and expanded in a manner characteristic of folklore.&quot; In Gnostic thought the pearl may represent Christ or the true self. In the Gnostic Acts of Peter and the Twelve, found with the Gospel of Thomas in the Nag Hammadi library, the travelling pearl merchant Lithargoel is eventually revealed to be Jesus.

==Depictions==
There have been several depictions of the New Testament parable in art, including works by Domenico Fetti, John Everett Millais and Jan Luyken.

<doc id="23590" wikidata="Q728455" url="?curid=23590" title="Pantheism">
<text>Pantheism is the philosophical and religious belief that reality, the universe, and nature are identical to divinity or a supreme entity. The physical universe is thus understood as an immanent deity, still expanding and creating, which has existed since the beginning of time. The term &quot;pantheist&quot; designates one who holds both that everything constitutes a unity and that this unity is divine, consisting of an all-encompassing, manifested god or goddess. All astronomical objects are thence viewed as parts of a sole deity. 

Another definition of pantheism is the worship of all gods of every religion, but this is more precisely termed omnism.
Pantheist belief does not recognize a distinct personal god, anthropomorphic or otherwise, but instead characterizes a broad range of doctrines differing in forms of relationships between reality and divinity. Pantheistic concepts date back thousands of years, and pantheistic elements have been identified in various religious traditions. The term &quot;pantheism&quot; was coined by mathematician Joseph Raphson in 1697 and since then, it has been used to describe the beliefs of a variety of people and organizations.

Pantheism was popularized in Western culture as a theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza, in particular, his book &quot;Ethics&quot;. A pantheistic stance was also taken in the 16th century by philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno.

In the East, Advaita Vedanta, a school of Hindu philosophy is thought to be similar to pantheism in Western philosophy. The early Taoism of Laozi and Zhuangzi is also sometimes considered pantheistic, although it could be more similar to panentheism. Cheondoism, which arose in the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, and Won Buddhism are also considered pantheistic.

==Etymology==
&quot;Pantheism&quot; derives from the Greek word πᾶν &quot;pan&quot; (meaning &quot;all, of everything&quot;) and θεός &quot;theos&quot; (meaning &quot;god, divine&quot;). The first known combination of these roots appears in Latin, in Joseph Raphson&#x27;s 1697 book &quot;De Spatio Reali seu Ente Infinito&quot;, where he refers to &quot;pantheismus&quot;.
It was subsequently translated into English as &quot;pantheism&quot; in 1702.

==Definitions==


There are numerous definitions of pantheism, including: 
* a theological and philosophical position which identifies God with the universe, or regards the universe as a manifestation of God; 
* the belief that everything is part of an all-encompassing, immanent God, and that all forms of reality may then be considered either modes of that Being, or identical with it; and 
* a non-religious philosophical position maintaining that the Universe (in the sense of the totality of all existence) and God are identical.

==History==
===Pre-modern times===
Early traces of pantheist thought can be found within animistic beliefs and tribal religions throughout the world as an expression of unity with the divine, specifically in beliefs that have no central polytheist or monotheist personas. Hellenistic theology makes early recorded reference to pantheism within the ancient Greek religion of Orphism, where &quot;pan&quot; (the all) is made cognate with the creator God Phanes (symbolizing the universe), and with Zeus, after the swallowing of Phanes.

Pantheistic tendencies existed in a number of Gnostic groups, with pantheistic thought appearing throughout the Middle Ages. These included the beliefs of mystics such as Ortlieb of Strasbourg, David of Dinant, Amalric of Bena, and Eckhart.

The Catholic Church has long regarded pantheistic ideas as heresy. Sebastian Franck was considered an early Pantheist. Giordano Bruno, an Italian friar who evangelized about a transcendent and infinite God, was burned at the stake in 1600 by the Roman Inquisition. He has since become known as a celebrated pantheist and martyr of science.

The Hindu philosophy of Advaita Vedanta is thought to be similar to pantheism. The term &quot;Advaita&quot; (literally &quot;non-secondness&quot;, but usually rendered as &quot;nondualism&quot;, and often equated with monism) refers to the idea that &quot;Brahman&quot; alone is ultimately real, while the transient phenomenal world is an illusory appearance (&quot;maya&quot;) of Brahman. In this view, &quot;jivatman&quot;, the experiencing self, is ultimately non-different (&quot;na aparah&quot;) from &quot;Ātman-Brahman&quot;, the highest Self or Reality. The &quot;jivatman&quot; or individual self is a mere reflection or limitation of singular &quot;Ātman&quot; in a multitude of apparent individual bodies.

===Baruch Spinoza===

In the West, pantheism was formalized as a separate theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese descent raised in the Sephardi Jewish community in Amsterdam. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the Divine, and was effectively excluded from Jewish society at age 23, when the local synagogue issued a &quot;herem&quot; against him. A number of his books were published posthumously, and shortly thereafter included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s &quot;Index of Forbidden Books&quot;.

In the posthumous &quot;Ethics&quot;, he opposed René Descartes&#x27; famous mind–body dualism, the theory that the body and spirit are separate. Spinoza held the monist view that the two are the same, and monism is a fundamental part of his philosophy. He was described as a &quot;God-intoxicated man,&quot; and used the word God to describe the unity of all substance. This view influenced philosophers such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who said, &quot;You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all.&quot; Spinoza earned praise as one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy and one of Western philosophy&#x27;s most important thinkers. Although the term &quot;pantheism&quot; was not coined until after his death, he is regarded as the most celebrated advocate of the concept. &quot;Ethics&quot; was the major source from which Western pantheism spread.

===18th century===
The first known use of the term &quot;pantheism&quot; was in Latin (&quot;pantheismus&quot;) by the English mathematician Joseph Raphson in his work &quot;De Spatio Reali seu Ente Infinito&quot;, published in 1697. Raphson begins with a distinction between atheistic &quot;panhylists&quot; (from the Greek roots &quot;&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;matter&quot;), who believe everything is matter, and Spinozan &quot;pantheists&quot; who believe in &quot;a certain universal substance, material as well as intelligence, that fashions all things that exist out of its own essence.&quot; Raphson thought that the universe was immeasurable in respect to a human&#x27;s capacity of understanding, and believed that humans would never be able to comprehend it. He referred to the pantheism of the Ancient Egyptians, Persians, Syrians, Assyrians, Greek, Indians, and Jewish Kabbalists, specifically referring to Spinoza.

The term was first used in English by a translation of Raphson&#x27;s work in 1702. It was later used and popularized by Irish writer John Toland in his work of 1705 &quot;Socinianism Truly Stated, by a Pantheist&quot;. Toland was influenced by both Spinoza and Bruno, and had read Joseph Raphson&#x27;s &quot;De Spatio Reali&quot;, referring to it as &quot;the ingenious Mr. Ralphson&#x27;s (sic) Book of Real Space&quot;. Like Raphson, he used the terms &quot;pantheist&quot; and &quot;Spinozist&quot; interchangeably. In 1720 he wrote the &quot;Pantheisticon: or The Form of Celebrating the Socratic-Society&quot; in Latin, envisioning a pantheist society that believed, &quot;All things in the world are one, and one is all in all things ... what is all in all things is God, eternal and immense, neither born nor ever to perish.&quot; He clarified his idea of pantheism in a letter to Gottfried Leibniz in 1710 when he referred to &quot;the pantheistic opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe&quot;.

In the mid-eighteenth century, the English theologian Daniel Waterland defined pantheism this way: &quot;It supposes God and nature, or God and the whole universe, to be one and the same substance—one universal being; insomuch that men&#x27;s souls are only modifications of the divine substance.&quot; In the early nineteenth century, the German theologian Julius Wegscheider defined pantheism as the belief that God and the world established by God are one and the same.

Between 1785–89, a controversy about Spinoza&#x27;s philosophy arose between the German philosophers Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi (a critic) and Moses Mendelssohn (a defender). Known in German as the &quot;Pantheismusstreit&quot; (pantheism controversy), it helped spread pantheism to many German thinkers.

===19th century===

====Growing influence====
During the beginning of the 19th century, pantheism was the viewpoint of many leading writers and philosophers, attracting figures such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge in Britain; Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Schelling and Hegel in Germany; Knut Hamsun in Norway; and Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau in the United States. Seen as a growing threat by the Vatican, in 1864 it was formally condemned by Pope Pius IX in the &quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot;.

A letter written in 1886 by William Herndon, Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s law partner, was sold at auction for US$30,000 in 2011. In it, Herndon writes of the U.S. President&#x27;s evolving religious views, which included pantheism.
The subject is understandably controversial, but the content of the letter is consistent with Lincoln&#x27;s fairly lukewarm approach to organized religion.

====Comparison with non-Christian religions====
Some 19th-century theologians thought that various pre-Christian religions and philosophies were pantheistic. They thought Pantheism was similar to the ancient Hinduism philosophy of Advaita (non-dualism).

19th-century European theologians also considered Ancient Egyptian religion to contain pantheistic elements and pointed to Egyptian philosophy as a source of Greek Pantheism. The latter included some of the Presocratics, such as Heraclitus and Anaximander. The Stoics were pantheists, beginning with Zeno of Citium and culminating in the emperor-philosopher Marcus Aurelius. During the pre-Christian Roman Empire, Stoicism was one of the three dominant schools of philosophy, along with Epicureanism and Neoplatonism. The early Taoism of Laozi and Zhuangzi is also sometimes considered pantheistic, although it could be more similar to panentheism.

Cheondoism, which arose in the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, and Won Buddhism are also considered pantheistic. The Realist Society of Canada believes that the consciousness of the self-aware universe is reality, which is an alternative view of Pantheism.

===20th century===
In the late 20th century, some declared that pantheism was an underlying theology of Neopaganism, and pantheists began forming organizations devoted specifically to pantheism and treating it as a separate religion.
===21st century===

Dorion Sagan, son of scientist and science communicator Carl Sagan, published the 2007 book &quot;Dazzle Gradually: Reflections on the Nature of Nature&quot;, co-written with his mother Lynn Margulis. In the chapter &quot;Truth of My Father&quot;, Sagan writes that his &quot;father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature, but as nature, equivalent to it.&quot;

In 2009, pantheism was mentioned in a Papal encyclical and in a statement on New Year&#x27;s Day, 2010, criticizing pantheism for denying the superiority of humans over nature and seeing the source of man salvation in nature.

In 2015, The Paradise Project, an organization &quot;dedicated to celebrating and spreading awareness about pantheism,&quot; commissioned Los Angeles muralist Levi Ponce to paint the 75-foot mural in Venice, California, near the organization&#x27;s offices. The mural depicts Albert Einstein, Alan Watts, Baruch Spinoza, Terence McKenna, Carl Jung, Carl Sagan, Emily Dickinson, Nikola Tesla, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ralph Waldo Emerson, W.E.B. Du Bois, Henry David Thoreau, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Rumi, Adi Shankara, and Laozi.

==Categorizations==
There are multiple varieties of pantheism and various systems of classifying them relying upon one or more spectra or in discrete categories.

===Degree of determinism===
The philosopher Charles Hartshorne used the term Classical Pantheism to describe the deterministic philosophies of Baruch Spinoza, the Stoics, and other like-minded figures. Pantheism (All-is-God) is often associated with monism (All-is-One) and some have suggested that it logically implies determinism (All-is-Now). Albert Einstein explained theological determinism by stating, &quot;the past, present, and future are an &#x27;illusion. This form of pantheism has been referred to as &quot;extreme monism&quot;, in which in the words of one commentator &quot;God decides or determines everything, including our supposed decisions.&quot; Other examples of determinism-inclined pantheisms include those of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Hegel.

However, some have argued against treating every meaning of &quot;unity&quot; as an aspect of pantheism, and there exist versions of pantheism that regard determinism as an inaccurate or incomplete view of nature. Examples include the beliefs of John Scotus Eriugena, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and William James.

===Degree of belief===
It may also be possible to distinguish two types of pantheism, one being more religious and the other being more philosophical. The Columbia Encyclopedia writes of the distinction:
:&quot;If the pantheist starts with the belief that the one great reality, eternal and infinite, is God, he sees everything finite and temporal as but some part of God. There is nothing separate or distinct from God, for God is the universe. If, on the other hand, the conception taken as the foundation of the system is that the great inclusive unity is the world itself, or the universe, God is swallowed up in that unity, which may be designated nature.&quot;

===Form of monism===

Philosophers and theologians have often suggested that pantheism implies monism. 

For the Aztecs &quot;teotl&quot; was the metaphysical omnipresence creating the cosmos and all its contents &quot;from within&quot; itself as well as &quot;out of&quot; itself. This is conceptualized in a kind of monistic pantheism as manifest in the supreme god Ometeotl, as well as a large pantheon of lesser gods and idealizations of natural phenomena.

===Other===
In 1896, J. H. Worman, a theologian, identified seven categories of pantheism: Mechanical or materialistic (God the mechanical unity of existence); Ontological (fundamental unity, Spinoza); Dynamic; Psychical (God is the soul of the world); Ethical (God is the universal moral order, Fichte); Logical (Hegel); and Pure (absorption of God into nature, which Worman equates with atheism).

In 1984, Paul D. Feinberg, professor of biblical and systematic theology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, also identified seven: Hylozoistic; Immanentistic; Absolutistic monistic; Relativistic monistic; Acosmic; Identity of opposites; and Neoplatonic or emanationistic.

== Demographics ==

=== Prevalence ===
According to censuses of 2011, the UK was the country with the most Pantheists. As of 2011, about 1,000 Canadians identified their religion as &quot;Pantheist&quot;, representing 0.003% of the population. By 2021, the number of Canadian pantheists had risen to 1,855 (0.005%). In Ireland, Pantheism rose from 202 in 1991, to 1106 in 2002, to 1,691 in 2006, 1,940 in 2011. In New Zealand, there was exactly one pantheist man in 1901. By 1906, the number of pantheists in New Zealand had septupled to 7 (6 male, 1 female). This number had further risen to 366 by 2006.
=== Age, ethnicity, and gender ===
The 2021 Canadian census showed that pantheists were somewhat more likely to be in their 20s and 30s compared to the general population. People under 15 were about four times less likely to be pantheist than the general population.

The 2021 Canadian census also showed that pantheists were less likely to be part of a recognized minority group compared to the general population, with 90.3% of pantheists not being part of any minority group (compared to 73.5% of the general population). The census did not register any pantheists who were Arab, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean, or Japanese.

In Canada (2011), there was no gender difference in regards to pantheism. However, in Ireland (2011), pantheists were slightly more likely to be female (1074 pantheists, 0.046% of women) than male (866 pantheists, 0.038% of men). In contrast, Canada (2021) showed pantheists to be slightly more likely to be male, with men representing 51.5% of pantheists.

Nature worship or nature mysticism is often conflated and confused with pantheism. It is pointed out by at least one expert, Harold Wood, founder of the Universal Pantheist Society, that in pantheist philosophy Spinoza&#x27;s identification of God with nature is very different from a recent idea of a self identifying pantheist with environmental ethical concerns. His use of the word nature to describe his worldview may be vastly different from the &quot;nature&quot; of modern sciences. He and other nature mystics who also identify as pantheists use &quot;nature&quot; to refer to the limited natural environment (as opposed to man-made built environment). This use of &quot;nature&quot; is different from the broader use from Spinoza and other pantheists describing natural laws and the overall phenomena of the physical world. Nature mysticism may be compatible with pantheism but it may also be compatible with theism and other views. Pantheism has also been involved in animal worship especially in primal religions.

Nontheism is an umbrella term which has been used to refer to a variety of religions not fitting traditional theism, and under which pantheism has been included.

Panentheism (from Greek πᾶν (pân) &quot;all&quot;; ἐν (en) &quot;in&quot;; and θεός (theós) &quot;God&quot;; &quot;all-in-God&quot;) was formally coined in Germany in the 19th century in an attempt to offer a philosophical synthesis between traditional theism and pantheism, stating that God is substantially omnipresent in the physical universe but also exists &quot;apart from&quot; or &quot;beyond&quot; it as its Creator and Sustainer. Thus panentheism separates itself from pantheism, positing the extra claim that God exists above and beyond the world as we know it. The line between pantheism and panentheism can be blurred depending on varying definitions of God, so there have been disagreements when assigning particular notable figures to pantheism or panentheism.

Pandeism is another word derived from pantheism, and is characterized as a combination of reconcilable elements of pantheism and deism. It assumes a Creator-deity that is at some point distinct from the universe and then transforms into it, resulting in a universe similar to the pantheistic one in present essence, but differing in origin.

Panpsychism is the philosophical view that consciousness, mind, or soul is a universal feature of all things. Some pantheists also subscribe to the distinct philosophical views hylozoism (or panvitalism), the view that everything is alive, and its close neighbor animism, the view that everything has a soul or spirit.

==Pantheism in religion==

===Traditional religions===
Many traditional and folk religions including African traditional religions and Native American religions can be seen as pantheistic, or a mixture of pantheism and other doctrines such as polytheism and animism. According to pantheists, there are elements of pantheism in some forms of Christianity.

Ideas resembling pantheism existed in Eastern religions before the 18th century (notably Hinduism, Confucianism, and Taoism). Although there is no evidence that these influenced Spinoza&#x27;s work, there is such evidence regarding other contemporary philosophers, such as Leibniz, and later Voltaire. In the case of Hinduism, pantheistic views exist alongside panentheistic, polytheistic, monotheistic, and atheistic ones. 

===Spirituality and new religious movements===
Pantheism is popular in modern spirituality and new religious movements, such as Neopaganism and Theosophy. Two organizations that specify the word pantheism in their title formed in the last quarter of the 20th century. The Universal Pantheist Society, open to all varieties of pantheists and supportive of environmental causes, was founded in 1975. The World Pantheist Movement is headed by Paul Harrison, an environmentalist, writer and a former vice president of the Universal Pantheist Society, from which he resigned in 1996. The World Pantheist Movement was incorporated in 1999 to focus exclusively on promoting naturalistic pantheism – a strict metaphysical naturalistic version of pantheism, considered by some a form of religious naturalism. It has been described as an example of &quot;dark green religion&quot; with a focus on environmental ethics.

<text>Panentheism (; &quot;all in God&quot;, from the Greek , and ) is the belief that the divine intersects every part of the universe and also extends beyond space and time. The term was coined by the German philosopher Karl Krause in 1828 (after reviewing Hindu scripture) to distinguish the ideas of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854) about the relation of God and the universe from the supposed pantheism of Baruch Spinoza. Unlike pantheism, which holds that the divine and the universe are identical, panentheism maintains an ontological distinction between the divine and the non-divine and the significance of both.

In panentheism, the universal spirit is present everywhere, which at the same time &quot;transcends&quot; all things created. Whilst pantheism asserts that &quot;all is God&quot;, panentheism claims that God is greater than the universe. Some versions of panentheism suggest that the universe is nothing more than the manifestation of God. In addition, some forms indicate that the universe is contained within God, like in the Kabbalistic concept of &quot;tzimtzum&quot;. Much of Hindu thought is highly characterized by panentheism and pantheism.

== In philosophy ==
=== Ancient Greek philosophy ===
The religious beliefs of Neoplatonism can be regarded as panentheistic. Plotinus taught that there was an ineffable transcendent God (&quot;the One&quot;, &quot;to En&quot;, τὸ Ἕν) of which subsequent realities were emanations. From &quot;the One&quot; emanates the Divine Mind (&quot;Nous&quot;, Νοῦς) and the Cosmic Soul (&quot;Psyche&quot;, Ψυχή). In Neoplatonism the world itself is God (according to Plato&#x27;s Timaeus 37). This concept of divinity is associated with that of the &quot;Logos&quot; (Λόγος), which had originated centuries earlier with Heraclitus (c. 535–475 BC). The &quot;Logos&quot; pervades the cosmos, whereby all thoughts and all things originate, or as Heraclitus said: &quot;He who hears not me but the Logos will say: All is one.&quot; Neoplatonists such as Iamblichus attempted to reconcile this perspective by adding another hypostasis above the original monad of force or &quot;Dynamis&quot; (Δύναμις). This new all-pervasive monad encompassed all creation and its original uncreated emanations.

=== Modern philosophy ===
Baruch Spinoza later claimed that &quot;Whatsoever is, is in God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived.&quot; &quot;Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner.&quot; Though Spinoza has been called the &quot;prophet&quot; and &quot;prince&quot; of pantheism, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg Spinoza states that: &quot;as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken&quot;. For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a mode under two attributes of Thought and Extension. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world.

According to German philosopher Karl Jaspers, when Spinoza wrote &quot;Deus sive Natura&quot; (God or Nature) Spinoza did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God&#x27;s transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God&#x27;s immanence. Furthermore, Martial Guéroult suggested the term &quot;panentheism&quot;, rather than &quot;pantheism&quot; to describe Spinoza&#x27;s view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, &quot;in&quot; God. Yet, American philosopher and self-described panentheist Charles Hartshorne referred to Spinoza&#x27;s philosophy as &quot;classical pantheism&quot; and distinguished Spinoza&#x27;s philosophy from panentheism.
In 1828, the German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause (1781–1832) seeking to reconcile monotheism and pantheism, coined the term &quot;panentheism&quot; (from the Ancient Greek expression πᾶν ἐν θεῷ, &quot;pān en theṓ&quot;, literally &quot;all in god&quot;). This conception of God influenced New England transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson. The term was popularized by Charles Hartshorne in his development of process theology and has also been closely identified with the New Thought. The formalization of this term in the West in the 19th century was not new; philosophical treatises had been written on it in the context of Hinduism for millennia.

Philosophers who embraced panentheism have included Thomas Hill Green (1839–1882), James Ward (1843–1925), Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison (1856–1931) and Samuel Alexander (1859–1938). Beginning in the 1940s, Hartshorne examined numerous conceptions of God. He reviewed and discarded pantheism, deism, and pandeism in favor of panentheism, finding that such a &quot;doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations&quot;. Hartshorne formulated God as a being who could become &quot;more perfect&quot;: He has absolute perfection in categories for which absolute perfection is possible, and relative perfection (i. e., is superior to all others) in categories for which perfection cannot be precisely determined.

== In religion ==
=== Buddhism ===
The Reverend Zen Master Soyen Shaku was the first Zen Buddhist Abbot to tour the United States in 1905–6. He wrote a series of essays collected into the book &quot;Zen For Americans&quot;. In the essay titled &quot;The God Conception of Buddhism&quot; he attempts to explain how a Buddhist looks at the ultimate without an anthropomorphic God figure while still being able to relate to the term God in a Buddhist sense:

At the outset, let me state that Buddhism is not atheistic as the term is ordinarily understood. It has certainly a God, the highest reality and truth, through which and in which this universe exists. However, the followers of Buddhism usually avoid the term God, for it savors so much of Christianity, whose spirit is not always exactly in accord with the Buddhist interpretation of religious experience. Again, Buddhism is not pantheistic in the sense that it identifies the universe with God. On the other hand, the Buddhist God is absolute and transcendent; this world, being merely its manifestation, is necessarily fragmental and imperfect. To define more exactly the Buddhist notion of the highest being, it may be convenient to borrow the term very happily coined by a modern German scholar, &quot;panentheism,&quot; according to which God is πᾶν καὶ ἕν (all and one) and more than the totality of existence.

The essay then goes on to explain first utilizing the term &quot;God&quot; for the American audience to get an initial understanding of what he means by &quot;panentheism,&quot; and then discusses the terms that Buddhism uses in place of &quot;God&quot; such as Dharmakaya, Buddha or Adi-Buddha, and Tathagata.

====Pure land Buddhism====
=== Christianity ===
Panentheism is also a feature of some Christian philosophical theologies and resonates strongly within the theological tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church. It also appears in process theology. Process theological thinkers are generally regarded in the Christian West as unorthodox. Furthermore, process philosophical thought is widely believed to have paved the way for open theism, a movement that tends to associate itself primarily with the Evangelical branch of Protestantism, but is also generally considered unorthodox by most Evangelicals.

====Catholic panentheism====
A number of ordained Catholic mystics (including Richard Rohr, David Steindl-Rast, and Thomas Keating) have suggested that panentheism is the original view of Christianity. They hold that such a view is directly supported by mystical experience and the teachings of Jesus and Saint Paul. Richard Rohr surmises this in his 2019 book, &quot;The Universal Christ&quot;:

Similarly, David Steindl-Rast posits that Christianity&#x27;s original panentheism is being revealed through contemporary mystical insight:

 This sentiment is mirrored in Thomas Keating&#x27;s 1993 article, &quot;Clarifications Regarding Centering Prayer&quot;:

==== Panentheism in other Christian confessions ====
Panentheistic conceptions of God occur amongst some modern theologians. Process theology and Creation Spirituality, two recent developments in Christian theology, contain panentheistic ideas. Charles Hartshorne (1897–2000), who conjoined process theology with panentheism, maintained a lifelong membership in the Methodist church but was also a Unitarian. In later years he joined the Austin, Texas, Unitarian Universalist congregation and was an active participant in that church. Referring to the ideas such as Thomas Oord&#x27;s ‘theocosmocentrism’ (2010), the soft panentheism of open theism, Keith Ward&#x27;s comparative theology and John Polkinghorne&#x27;s critical realism (2009), Raymond Potgieter observes distinctions such as dipolar and bipolar:

The former suggests two poles separated such as God influencing creation and it in turn its creator (Bangert 2006:168), whereas bipolarity completes God’s being implying interdependence between temporal and eternal poles. (Marbaniang 2011:133), in dealing with Whitehead’s approach, does not make this distinction. I use the term bipolar as a generic term to include suggestions of the structural definition of God’s transcendence and immanence; to for instance accommodate a present and future reality into which deity must reasonably fit and function, and yet maintain separation from this world and evil whilst remaining within it.

Some argue that panentheism should also include the notion that God has always been related to some world or another, which denies the idea of creation out of nothing (&quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot;). Nazarene Methodist theologian Thomas Jay Oord (* 1965) advocates panentheism, but he uses the word &quot;theocosmocentrism&quot; to highlight the notion that God and some world or another are the primary conceptual starting blocks for eminently fruitful theology. This form of panentheism helps in overcoming the problem of evil and in proposing that God&#x27;s love for the world is essential to who God is.

The Latter Day Saint movement teaches that the Light of Christ &quot;proceeds from God through Christ and gives life and light to all things&quot;.

=== Gnosticism ===
Manichaeists, being of another gnostic sect, preached a very different doctrine in positioning the true Manichaean God against matter as well as other deities, that it described as enmeshed with the world, namely the gods of Jews, Christians and pagans. Nevertheless, this dualistic teaching included an elaborate cosmological myth that narrates the defeat of primal man by the powers of darkness that devoured and imprisoned the particles of light.

Valentinian Gnosticism taught that matter came about through emanations of the supreme being, even if to some this event is held to be more accidental than intentional. To other gnostics, these emanations were akin to the Sephirot of the Kabbalists and deliberate manifestations of a transcendent God through a complex system of intermediaries.

=== Hinduism ===

The earliest reference to panentheistic thought in Hindu philosophy is in a creation myth contained in the later section of Rig Veda called the Purusha Sukta, which was compiled before 1100 BCE. The Purusha Sukta gives a description of the spiritual unity of the cosmos. It presents the nature of Purusha or the cosmic being as both immanent in the manifested world and yet transcendent to it. From this being the sukta holds, the original creative will proceeds, by which this vast universe is projected in space and time.

The most influential and dominant school of Indian philosophy, Advaita Vedanta, rejects theism and dualism by insisting that &quot;Brahman [ultimate reality] is without parts or attributes...one without a second.&quot; Since Brahman has no properties, contains no internal diversity and is identical with the whole reality it cannot be understood as an anthropomorphic personal God. The relationship between Brahman and the creation is often thought to be panentheistic.

Panentheism is also expressed in the Bhagavad Gita. In verse IX.4, Krishna states: 

Many schools of Hindu thought espouse monistic theism, which is thought to be similar to a panentheistic viewpoint. Nimbarka&#x27;s school of differential monism (Dvaitadvaita), Ramanuja&#x27;s school of qualified monism (Vishistadvaita) and Saiva Siddhanta and Kashmir Shaivism are all considered to be panentheistic. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu&#x27;s Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which elucidates the doctrine of Achintya Bheda Abheda (inconceivable oneness and difference), is also thought to be panentheistic. In Kashmir Shaivism, all things are believed to be a manifestation of Universal Consciousness (Cit or Brahman). So from the point of view of this school, the phenomenal world (&quot;Śakti&quot;) is real, and it exists and has its being in Consciousness (Ć&quot;it&quot;). Thus, Kashmir Shaivism is also propounding of theistic monism or panentheism.

Shaktism, or Tantra, is regarded as an Indian prototype of Panentheism. Shakti is considered to be the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy and dynamism, and the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Shiva is her transcendent masculine aspect, providing the divine ground of all being. &quot;There is no Shiva without Shakti, or Shakti without Shiva. The two ... in themselves are One.&quot; Thus, it is She who becomes the time and space, the cosmos, it is She who becomes the five elements, and thus all animate life and inanimate forms. She is the primordial energy that holds all creation and destruction, all cycles of birth and death, all laws of cause and effect within Herself, and yet is greater than the sum total of all these. She is transcendent, but becomes immanent as the cosmos (Mula Prakriti). She, the Primordial Energy, directly becomes Matter.

=== Judaism ===
While mainstream Rabbinic Judaism is classically monotheistic, and follows in the footsteps of Maimonides (c. 1135–1204), the panentheistic conception of God can be found among certain mystical Jewish traditions. A leading scholar of Kabbalah, Moshe Idel ascribes this doctrine to the kabbalistic system of Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (1522–1570) and in the eighteenth century to the Baal Shem Tov (c. 1700–1760), founder of the Hasidic movement, as well as his contemporaries, Rabbi Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezeritch (died 1772), and Menahem Mendel, the Maggid of Bar. This may be said of many, if not most, subsequent Hasidic masters. There is some debate as to whether Isaac Luria (1534–1572) and Lurianic Kabbalah, with its doctrine of tzimtzum, can be regarded as panentheistic.

According to Hasidism, the infinite Ein Sof is incorporeal and exists in a state that is both transcendent and immanent. This appears to be the view of non-Hasidic Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin, as well. Hasidic Judaism merges the elite ideal of nullification to a transcendent God, via the intellectual articulation of inner dimensions through Kabbalah and with emphasis on the panentheistic divine immanence in everything.

Many scholars would argue that &quot;panentheism&quot; is the best single-word description of the philosophical theology of Baruch Spinoza. It is therefore no surprise, that aspects of panentheism are also evident in the theology of Reconstructionist Judaism as presented in the writings of Mordecai Kaplan (1881–1983), who was strongly influenced by Spinoza.

=== Sikhism ===

Many newer, contemporary Sikhs have suggested that human souls and the monotheistic God are two different realities (dualism), distinguishing it from the monistic and various shades of nondualistic philosophies of other Indian religions. However, Sikh scholars have explored nondualist exegesis of Sikh scriptures, such as Bhai Vir Singh. According to Mandair, Vir Singh interprets the Sikh scriptures as teaching nonduality. The renowned Sikh Scholar, Bhai Mani Singh, is quoted to saying that Sikhism has all the essence of Vedanta Philosophy. Historically, the Sikh symbol of Ik Oankaar has had a monist meaning, and has been reduced to simply meaning, &quot;There is but One God&quot;, which is incorrect. Older exegesis of Sikh scripture, such as the Faridkot Teeka, and Garab Ganjani Teeka has always described Sikh Metaphysics as a non-dual, panentheistic universe. For this reason, Sikh Metaphysics has often been compared to the Non-Dual, Vedanta metaphysics. The Sikh Poet, Bhai Nand Lal, often used Sufi terms to describe Sikh philosophy, talking about wahdat ul-wujud in his Persian poetry.

=== Islam ===
Wahdat ul-wujud (the Unity of All Things) is a concept sometimes described as pantheism or panentheistic. It is primarily associated with the Asharite Sufi scholar Ibn Arabi. Some Sufi Orders, notably the Bektashis and the Universal Sufi movement, adhere to similar panentheistic beliefs. Same is said about the Nizari Ismaili who follow panentheism according to Ismaili doctrine.

=== In Pre-Columbian America ===
The Mesoamerican empires of the Mayas, Aztecs as well as the South American Incas (Tahuatinsuyu) have typically been characterized as polytheistic, with strong male and female deities. According to Charles C. Mann&#x27;s history book &quot;1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus&quot;, only the lower classes of Aztec society were polytheistic. Philosopher James Maffie has argued that Aztec metaphysics was panentheistic rather than pantheistic, since Teotl was considered by Aztec philosophers to be the ultimate all-encompassing yet all-transcending force defined by its inherit duality.

Native American beliefs in North America have been characterized as panentheistic in that there is an emphasis on a single, unified divine spirit that is manifest in each individual entity. (North American Native writers have also translated the word for God as the Great Mystery or as the Sacred Other). This concept is referred to by many as the Great Spirit. Philosopher J. Baird Callicott has described Lakota theology as panentheistic, in that the divine both transcends and is immanent in everything.

One exception can be modern Cherokee who are predominantly monotheistic but apparently not panentheistic; yet in older Cherokee traditions many observe both aspects of pantheism and panentheism, and are often not beholden to exclusivity, encompassing other spiritual traditions without contradiction, a common trait among some tribes in the Americas. In the stories of Keetoowah storytellers Sequoyah Guess and Dennis Sixkiller, God is known as ᎤᏁᎳᏅᎯ, commonly pronounced &quot;unehlanv,&quot; and visited earth in prehistoric times, but then left earth and her people to rely on themselves. This shows a parallel to Vaishnava cosmology.

=== Konkōkyō ===
Konkokyo is a form of sectarian Japanese Shinto, and a faith within the Shinbutsu-shūgō tradition. Traditional Shintoism holds that an impersonal spirit manifests/penetrates the material world, giving all objects consciousness and spontaneously creating a system of natural mechanisms, forces, and phenomena (Musubi). Konkokyo deviates from traditional Shintoism by holding that this spirit (Comparable to Brahman), has a personal identity and mind. This personal form is non-different from the energy itself, not residing in any particular cosmological location. In Konkokyo, this god is named &quot;Tenchi Kane no Kami-Sama&quot; which can be translated directly as, &quot;Spirit of the gilded/golden heavens and earth&quot;.

Though practitioners of Konkokyo are small in number (~300,000 globally), the sect has birthed or influenced a multiplicity of Japanese New Religions, such as Oomoto. Many of these faiths carry on the Panentheistic views of Konkokyo

<doc id="23592" wikidata="Q178059" url="?curid=23592" title="Paraphilia">
<text>A paraphilia is an experience of recurring or intense sexual arousal to atypical objects, places, situations, fantasies, behaviors, or individuals. It has also been defined as a sexual interest in anything other than a legally consenting human partner. Paraphilias are contrasted with normophilic (&quot;normal&quot;) sexual interests, although the definition of what makes a sexual interest normal or atypical remains controversial.

The exact number and taxonomy of paraphilia is under debate; Anil Aggrawal has listed as many as 549 types of paraphilias. Several sub-classifications of paraphilia have been proposed; some argue that a fully dimensional, spectrum, or complaint-oriented approach would better reflect the evident diversity of human sexuality. Although paraphilias were believed in the 20th century to be rare among the general population, recent research has indicated that paraphilic interests are relatively common.

== Etymology ==
Coinage of the term &quot;paraphilia&quot; (&quot;paraphilie&quot;) has been credited to Friedrich Salomon Krauss in 1903 and it was used with some regularity by Wilhelm Stekel in the 1920s. The term comes from the Greek παρά (&quot;para&quot;), meaning &quot;other&quot; or &quot;outside of&quot;, and φιλία (&quot;-philia&quot;), meaning &quot;loving&quot;. The word was popularized by John Money in the 1980s as a non-pejorative designation for unusual sexual interests. It was first included in the DSM in its 1980 edition.

==Definition==
To date there is no broad scientific consensus for definitive boundaries between what are considered &quot;unconventional sexual interests&quot;, kinks, fetishes, and paraphilias. As such, these terms are often used loosely and interchangeably, especially in common parlance.

===History of paraphilic terminology===
Many terms have been used to describe atypical sexual interests, and there remains debate regarding technical accuracy and perceptions of stigma. Money described paraphilia as &quot;a sexuoerotic embellishment of, or alternative to the official, ideological norm.&quot; Psychiatrist Glen Gabbard writes that despite efforts by Wilhelm Stekel and John Money, &quot;the term &quot;paraphilia&quot; remains pejorative in most circumstances.&quot;

In the late 19th century, psychologists and psychiatrists started to categorize various paraphilias as they wanted a more descriptive system than the legal and religious constructs of sodomy, as well as perversion. In 1914, Albert Eulenburg observed a commonality across the paraphilias, using the terminology of his time writing, &quot;All the forms of sexual perversion ... have one thing in common: their roots reach down into the matrix of natural and normal sex life; there they are somehow closely connected with the feelings and expressions of our physiological erotism. They are ... hyperbolic intensifications, distortions, monstrous fruits of certain partial and secondary expressions of this erotism which is considered &#x27;normal&#x27; or at least within the limits of healthy sex feeling.&quot;

Before the introduction of the term &quot;paraphilia&quot; in the DSM-III (1980), the term &quot;sexual deviation&quot; was used to refer to paraphilias in the first two editions of the manual. In 1981, an article published in &quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot; described paraphilia as &quot;recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors generally involving&quot; the following:
* Non-human objects
* The suffering or humiliation of oneself or one&#x27;s partner
* Prepubescent children
* Non-consenting persons

===Definition of typical versus atypical interests===
Clinical literature contains reports of many paraphilias, only some of which receive their own entries in the diagnostic taxonomies of the American Psychiatric Association or the World Health Organization. There is disagreement regarding which sexual interests should be deemed paraphilic disorders versus normal variants of sexual interest. The DSM-IV-TR also acknowledges that the diagnosis and classification of paraphilias across cultures or religions &quot;is complicated by the fact that what is considered deviant in one cultural setting may be more acceptable in another setting&quot;. Some argue that cultural relativism is important to consider when discussing paraphilias, because there is wide variance concerning what is sexually acceptable across cultures. Consensual adult activities and adult entertainment involving sexual roleplay, novel, superficial, or trivial aspects of sexual fetishism, or incorporating the use of sex toys are not necessarily paraphilic.

=== Criticism of common definitions ===
There is scientific and political controversy regarding the continued inclusion of sex-related diagnoses such as the paraphilias in the DSM, due to the stigma of being classified as a mental illness. Some groups, seeking greater understanding and acceptance of sexual diversity, have lobbied for changes to the legal and medical status of unusual sexual interests and practices. Charles Allen Moser, a physician and advocate for sexual minorities, has argued that the diagnoses should be eliminated from diagnostic manuals. Ray Blanchard stated that the current definition of paraphilia in the DSM done by concatenation (i.e. by listing a set of paraphilias) and that defining the term by exclusion (anything that is not normophilic) is preferable.

===Inclusion and subsequent exclusion of homosexuality===
Homosexuality, now widely accepted as a variant of human sexuality, was at one time discussed as a sexual deviation. Sigmund Freud and subsequent psychoanalytic thinkers considered homosexuality and paraphilias to result from psychosexual non-normative relations to the Oedipal complex, although not in the antecedent version of the &#x27;Three Essays on Sexual Theory&#x27; where paraphilias are considered as stemming from an original polymorphous perversity. As such, the term &quot;sexual perversion&quot; or the epithet &quot;pervert&quot; have historically referred to gay men, as well as other non-heterosexuals (people who fall outside the perceived norms of sexual orientation).

By the mid-20th century, mental health practitioners began formalizing &quot;deviant sexuality&quot; classifications into categories. Originally coded as 000-x63, homosexuality was the top of the classification list (Code 302.0) until the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1973. Martin Kafka writes, &quot;Sexual disorders once considered paraphilias (e.g., homosexuality) are now regarded as variants of normal sexuality.&quot;

A 2012 literature study by clinical psychologist James Cantor, when comparing homosexuality with paraphilias, found that both share &quot;the features of onset and course (both homosexuality and paraphilia being life-long), but they appear to differ on sex ratio, fraternal birth order, handedness, IQ and cognitive profile, and neuroanatomy.&quot; The research then concluded that the data seemed to suggest paraphilias and homosexuality as two distinct categories but regarded the conclusion as &quot;quite tentative&quot; given the current limited understanding of paraphilias.

== Characteristics ==

Paraphilias typically arise in late adolescence or early adulthood. Persons with paraphilias are generally egosyntonic and view their paraphilias as something inherent in their being, although they recognize that their sexual fantasies lie outside the norm and may attempt to conceal them. Paraphilic interests are rarely exclusive and some people have more than one paraphilia. Some people with paraphilias may seek occupations and avocations that increase their access to objects of their sexual fantasies (e.g. voyeurs working in rental properties to &quot;peep&quot; on others or pedophiles working with Boy Scouts).

Research has found that some paraphilias, such as voyeurism and sadomasochism, are associated with more lifetime sexual partners, contradicting theories that paraphilias are associated with courtship disorders and arrested social development. Scientific literature includes some single-case studies of very rare and idiosyncratic paraphilias. These include an adolescent male who had a strong fetishistic interest in the exhaust pipes of cars, a young man with a similar interest in a specific type of car, and a man who had a paraphilic interest in sneezing (both his own and the sneezing of others).

=== Causes and correlations ===
The causes of paraphilias in people are unclear, but some research points to a possible prenatal neurodevelopmental correlation. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 heterosexual men by using the Wilson Sex Fantasy Questionnaire exam determined that males with a pronounced degree of fetish interest had a greater number of older brothers, a high 2D:4D digit ratio (which would indicate excessive prenatal estrogen exposure), and an elevated probability of being left-handed, suggesting that disturbed hemispheric brain lateralization may play a role in paraphilic attractions. Behavioral explanations propose that paraphilias are conditioned early in life, during an experience that pairs the paraphilic stimulus with intense sexual arousal. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema suggests that, once established, masturbatory fantasies about the stimulus reinforce and broaden the paraphilic arousal.

==Prevalence==
Although paraphilic interests in the general population were believed to be rare, research has shown that fantasies and behaviors related to voyeurism, sadomasochism and couple exhibitionism are not statistically uncommon among adults. In a study conducted in a population of men, 62% of participants reported at least one paraphilic interest. In another sample of college students, voyeurism was reported in 52% of men. The DSM-5 estimates that 2.2% of males and 1.3% of females in Australia engaged in bondage and discipline, sadomasochism, or dominance and submission within the past 12 months. The population prevalence of sexual masochism disorder is unknown.

=== Among women ===
Paraphilias are rarely observed in women; however, there have been some studies on females with paraphilias. Men and women differ on the content of their sexual fantasies, with the former reporting greater proportions of fetishism, exhibitionism and sadism, and the latter reporting greater proportions of masochism. Sexual masochism has been found to be the most commonly observed paraphilia in women, with approximately 1 in 20 cases.

== In ancient cultures ==
Paraphilic fantasies and behaviors have been registered in multiple old and ancient sources. Voyeurism, bestiality, exhibitionism and necrophilia have been described in the Bible. Sexual relations with animals have also been depicted in cave paintings. Some ancient sex manuals such as the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; (450), &quot;Koka Shastra&quot; (1150) and &quot;Ananga Ranga&quot; (1500) discuss biting, marks left after sex and love blows. Although evidence suggests that paraphilic behaviors have existed prior to the Renaissance, it is difficult to ascertain how common they were and how many people had persistent paraphilic fantasies in ancient times.
Bestiality has been depicted multiple times in Greek mythology, although the act itself usually involved a deity in zoomorphic form, such as Zeus seducing Europa, Leda and Persephone while disguised as a bull, a swan and a serpent, respectively. Zeus was also depicted, in the form of an eagle, abducting Ganymede, an act that alludes to both bestiality and pederastry. Some fragments of Hittite law include prohibitions of and permissions to engage in specific acts of bestiality.

Havelock Ellis pointed to an example of sexual masochism in the fifteenth century. The report, written by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, described a man who could only be aroused by being beaten with a whip dipped in vinegar. Wilhelm Stekel also noted that Rousseau also discussed his own masochism in his &quot;Confessions&quot;. Other similar instances of persistent paraphilic fantasies were reported between 1516 and 1643 by Coelius Sedulius, Rhodiginus, Brundel and Meibomius.

== Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) ==
=== DSM-I and DSM-II ===
In American psychiatry, prior to the publication of the DSM-I, paraphilias were classified as cases of &quot;psychopathic personality with pathologic sexuality&quot;. The DSM-I (1952) included sexual deviation as a personality disorder of sociopathic subtype. The only diagnostic guidance was that sexual deviation should have been &quot;reserved for deviant sexuality which [was] not symptomatic of more extensive syndromes, such as schizophrenic or obsessional reactions&quot;. The specifics of the disorder were to be provided by the clinician as a &quot;supplementary term&quot; to the sexual deviation diagnosis; there were no restrictions in the DSM-I on what this supplementary term could be. Researcher Anil Aggrawal writes that the now-obsolete DSM-I listed examples of supplementary terms for pathological behavior to include &quot;homosexuality, transvestism, pedophilia, fetishism, and sexual sadism, including rape, sexual assault, mutilation.&quot;

The DSM-II (1968) continued to use the term &quot;sexual deviations&quot;, no longer ascribed them under personality disorders but rather alongside them in a broad category titled &quot;personality disorders and certain other nonpsychotic mental disorders&quot;. The types of sexual deviations listed in the DSM-II were: sexual orientation disturbance (homosexuality), fetishism, pedophilia, transvestitism, exhibitionism, voyeurism, sadism, masochism, and &quot;other sexual deviation&quot;. No definition or examples were provided for &quot;other sexual deviation&quot; but the general category of sexual deviation was meant to describe the sexual preference of individuals that was &quot;directed primarily toward objects other than people of opposite sex, toward sexual acts not usually associated with coitus, or toward coitus performed under bizarre circumstances, as in necrophilia, pedophilia, sexual sadism, and fetishism.&quot; Except for the removal of homosexuality from the DSM-III onwards, this definition provided a general standard that has guided specific definitions of paraphilias in subsequent DSM editions, up to DSM-IV-TR.

=== DSM-III through DSM-IV ===
The term &quot;paraphilia&quot; was introduced in the DSM-III (1980) as a subset of the new category of &quot;psychosexual disorders&quot;. The DSM-III-R (1987) renamed the broad category to sexual disorders, renamed atypical paraphilia to paraphilia NOS (not otherwise specified), renamed transvestism as transvestic fetishism, added frotteurism, and moved zoophilia to the NOS category. It also provided seven nonexhaustive examples of NOS paraphilias, which besides zoophilia included exhibitionism, necrophilia, partialism, coprophilia, klismaphilia, and urophilia. The DSM-IV (1994) retained the sexual disorders classification for paraphilias, but added an even broader category, &quot;sexual and gender identity disorders&quot;, which includes them. The DSM-IV retained the same types of paraphilias listed in DSM-III-R, including the NOS examples, but introduced some changes to the definitions of some specific types.

=== DSM-IV-TR ===
The DSM-IV-TR describes paraphilias as &quot;recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviors generally involving nonhuman objects, the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one&#x27;s partner, or children or other nonconsenting persons that occur over a period of six months&quot; (criterion A), which &quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot; (criterion B). DSM-IV-TR names eight specific paraphilic disorders (exhibitionism, fetishism, frotteurism, pedophilia, sexual masochism, sexual sadism, voyeurism, and transvestic fetishism, plus a residual category, paraphilia—not otherwise specified). Criterion B differs for exhibitionism, frotteurism, and pedophilia to include acting on these urges, and for sadism, acting on these urges with a nonconsenting person. Sexual arousal in association with objects that were designed for sexual purposes is not diagnosable. Some paraphilias may interfere with the capacity for sexual activity with consenting adult partners. In the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), a paraphilia is not diagnosable as a psychiatric disorder unless it causes distress to the individual or harm to others.

=== DSM-5 ===
The DSM-5 adds a distinction between &quot;paraphilias&quot; and &quot;paraphilic disorders&quot;, stating that paraphilias do not require or justify psychiatric treatment in themselves, and defining &quot;paraphilic disorder&quot; as &quot;a paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of harm, to others&quot;. The DSM-5 Paraphilias Subworkgroup reached a &quot;consensus that paraphilias are not &quot;ipso facto&quot; psychiatric disorders&quot;, and proposed &quot;that the DSM-V make a distinction between &quot;paraphilias&quot; and paraphilic &quot;disorders&quot;. One would &quot;ascertain&quot; a paraphilia (according to the nature of the urges, fantasies, or behaviors) but &quot;diagnose&quot; a paraphilic disorder (on the basis of distress and impairment). In this conception, having a paraphilia would be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic disorder.&quot; The &#x27;Rationale&#x27; page of any paraphilia in the electronic DSM-5 draft continues: &quot;This approach leaves intact the distinction between normative and non-normative sexual behavior, which could be important to researchers, but without automatically labeling non-normative sexual behavior as psychopathological. It also eliminates certain logical absurdities in the DSM-IV-TR. In that version, for example, a man cannot be classified as a transvestite—however much he cross-dresses and however sexually exciting that is to him—unless he is unhappy about this activity or impaired by it. This change in viewpoint would be reflected in the diagnostic criteria sets by the addition of the word &#x27;Disorder&#x27; to all the paraphilias. Thus, Sexual Sadism would become Sexual Sadism Disorder; Sexual Masochism would become Sexual Masochism Disorder, and so on.&quot;

Bioethics professor Alice Dreger interpreted these changes as &quot;a subtle way of saying sexual kinks are basically okay – so okay, the sub-work group doesn&#x27;t actually bother to define paraphilia. But a paraphilic disorder is defined: that&#x27;s when an atypical sexual interest causes distress or impairment to the individual or harm to others.&quot; Interviewed by Dreger, Ray Blanchard, the Chair of the Paraphilias Sub-Work Group, stated, &quot;We tried to go as far as we could in depathologizing mild and harmless paraphilias, while recognizing that severe paraphilias that distress or impair people or cause them to do harm to others are validly regarded as disorders.&quot; Charles Allen Moser stated that this change is not really substantive, as the DSM-IV already acknowledged a difference between paraphilias and non-pathological but unusual sexual interests, a distinction that is virtually identical to what was being proposed for DSM-5, and it is a distinction that, in practice, has often been ignored. Linguist Andrew Clinton Hinderliter argued that &quot;including some sexual interests—but not others—in the DSM creates a fundamental asymmetry and communicates a negative value judgment against the sexual interests included,&quot; and leaves the paraphilias in a situation similar to ego-dystonic homosexuality, which was removed from the DSM because it was no longer recognized as a mental disorder.

The DSM-5 has specific listings for eight paraphilic disorders. These are voyeuristic disorder, exhibitionistic disorder, frotteuristic disorder, sexual masochism disorder, sexual sadism disorder, pedophilic disorder, fetishistic disorder, and transvestic disorder. Other paraphilic disorders can be diagnosed under the Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder or Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder listings, if accompanied by distress or impairment.

==International Classification of Diseases==

=== ICD-6,  ICD-7,  ICD-8 ===
In the ICD-6 (1948) and ICD-7 (1955), a category of &quot;sexual deviation&quot; was listed with &quot;other Pathological personality disorders&quot;. In the ICD-8 (1965), &quot;sexual deviations&quot; were categorized as homosexuality, fetishism, pedophilia, transvestism, exhibitionism, voyeurism, sadism and masochism.

=== ICD-9 ===
In the ICD-9 (1975), the category of sexual deviations and disorders was expanded to include transsexualism, sexual dysfunctions, and psychosexual identity disorders. The list contained homosexuality, bestiality, pedophilia, transvestism, exhibitionism, transexualism, Disorders of psychosexual identity, frigidity and impotence, Other sexual deviations and disorders (including fetishism, masochism, and sadism).

=== ICD-10 ===
In the ICD-10 (1990), the category &quot;sexual deviations and disorders&quot; was divided into several subcategories. Paraphilias were placed in subcategory of &quot;sexual preference disorders&quot;. The list included fetishism, fetishistic transvestism, exhibitionism, voyeurism, pedophilia, sadomasochism and other disorders of sexual preference (including frotteurism, necrophilia, and zoophilia). Homosexuality was removed from the list, but ego-dystonic sexual orientation was still considered a deviation which was placed in subcategory &quot;psychological and behavioural disorders associated with sexual development and orientation&quot;.

=== ICD-11 ===
In the ICD-11 (2022), &quot;paraphilia&quot; has been replaced with &quot;paraphilic disorder&quot;. Any paraphilia and any other arousal pattern &quot;by itself&quot; no longer constitutes a disorder. To date, the diagnosis must meet criteria of paraphilia &quot;and&quot; one of the following: 1) a marked distress associated with arousal pattern (but not one that comes from rejection or fear of rejection); 2) the person has acted on the arousal pattern towards unwilling others or others considered as unable to give consent; 3) a serious risk of injury or death. The list of the paraphilic disorders includes: Exhibitionistic Disorder, Voyeuristic Disorder, Pedophilic Disorder, Coercive Sexual Sadism Disorder, Frotteuristic Disorder, Other Paraphilic Disorder Involving Non-Consenting Individuals, and Other Paraphilic Disorder Involving Solitary Behaviour or Consenting Individuals. As of now, disorders associated with sexual orientation have been removed from the ICD. Gender issues have been removed from the mental health category and have been placed under &quot;Conditions related to sexual health&quot;.

==Paraphilic disorders==
Most clinicians and researchers believe that paraphilic sexual interests cannot be altered, although evidence is needed to support this. Instead, the goal of therapy is normally to reduce the person&#x27;s discomfort with their paraphilia and limit the risk of any harmful, anti-social, or criminal behavior. Both psychotherapeutic and pharmacological methods are available to these ends. Cognitive behavioral therapy, at times, can help people with extreme paraphilic disorders develop strategies to avoid acting on their interests. Patients are taught to identify and cope with factors that make acting on their interests more likely, such as stress. It is currently the only form of psychotherapy for paraphilic disorders supported by randomized double-blind trials, as opposed to case studies and consensus of expert opinion.

===Medications===
Pharmacological treatments can help people control their sexual behaviors, but do not change the content of the paraphilia. They are typically combined with cognitive behavioral therapy for best effect.

====SSRIs====
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been well received and are considered an important pharmacological treatment of severe paraphilic disorders. They are proposed to work by reducing sexual arousal, compulsivity, and depressive symptoms. They have been used with exhibitionists, non-offending pedophiles, and compulsive masturbators.

====Antiandrogens====
Antiandrogens are used in more extreme cases. Similar to physical castration, they work by reducing androgen levels, and have thus been described as chemical castration. The antiandrogen cyproterone acetate has been shown to substantially reduce sexual fantasies and offending behaviors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (such as leuprorelin) have also been used to lower sex drive. Due to the side effects, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry recommends that hormonal treatments only be used when there is a serious risk of sexual violence, or when other methods have failed. Surgical castration has largely been abandoned because these pharmacological alternatives are similarly effective and less invasive.

===Legality===
In the United States, since 1990 a significant number of states have passed sexually violent predator laws. Following a series of landmark cases in the Supreme Court of the United States, persons diagnosed with extreme paraphilic disorders, particularly pedophilia (&quot;Kansas v. Hendricks&quot;, 1997) and others that cause serious difficulty controlling behavior (&quot;Kansas v. Crane&quot;, 2002), can be held indefinitely in civil confinement under various state legislation generically known as sexually violent predator laws and the federal Adam Walsh Act (&quot;United States v. Comstock&quot;, 2010).

<text>Pediatrics (American English) also spelled paediatrics (British English), is the branch of medicine that involves the medical care of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. In the United Kingdom, pediatrics covers many of their youth until the age of 18. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends people seek pediatric care through the age of 21, but some pediatric subspecialists continue to care for adults up to 25. Worldwide age limits of pediatrics have been trending upward year after year. A medical doctor who specializes in this area is known as a pediatrician, or paediatrician. The word &quot;pediatrics&quot; and its cognates mean &quot;healer of children&quot;, derived from the two Greek words: (&quot;pais&quot; &quot;child&quot;) and (&quot;iatros&quot; &quot;doctor, healer&quot;). Pediatricians work in clinics, research centers, universities, general hospitals and children&#x27;s hospitals, including those who practice pediatric subspecialties (e.g. neonatology requires resources available in a NICU).

==History==
The earliest mentions of child-specific medical problems appear in the &quot;Hippocratic Corpus&quot;, published in the fifth century B.C., and the famous &quot;Sacred Disease&quot;. These publications discussed topics such as childhood epilepsy and premature births. From the first to fourth centuries A.D., Greek philosophers and physicians Celsus, Soranus of Ephesus, Aretaeus, Galen, and Oribasius, also discussed specific illnesses affecting children in their works, such as rashes, epilepsy, and meningitis. Already Hippocrates, Aristotle, Celsus, Soranus, and Galen understood the differences in growing and maturing organisms that necessitated different treatment: &quot;&quot; (&quot;In general, boys should not be treated in the same way as men&quot;). Some of the oldest traces of pediatrics can be discovered in Ancient India where children&#x27;s doctors were called &quot;kumara bhrtya&quot;.

Even though some pediatric works existed during this time, they were scarce and rarely published due to a lack of knowledge in pediatric medicine. &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;, an ayurvedic text composed during the sixth century BCE, contains the text about pediatrics. Another ayurvedic text from this period is &quot;Kashyapa Samhita&quot;. A second century AD manuscript by the Greek physician and gynecologist Soranus of Ephesus dealt with neonatal pediatrics. Byzantine physicians Oribasius, Aëtius of Amida, Alexander Trallianus, and Paulus Aegineta contributed to the field. The Byzantines also built &quot;brephotrophia&quot; (crêches). Islamic Golden Age writers served as a bridge for Greco-Roman and Byzantine medicine and added ideas of their own, especially Haly Abbas, Yahya Serapion, Abulcasis, Avicenna, and Averroes. The Persian philosopher and physician al-Razi (865–925), sometimes called the father of pediatrics, published a monograph on pediatrics titled &quot;Diseases in Children&quot;. Also among the first books about pediatrics was &quot;Libellus [Opusculum] de aegritudinibus et remediis infantium&quot; 1472 (&quot;Little Book on Children Diseases and Treatment&quot;), by the Italian pediatrician Paolo Bagellardo. In sequence came Bartholomäus Metlinger&#x27;s &quot;Ein Regiment der Jungerkinder&quot; 1473, Cornelius Roelans (1450–1525) no title Buchlein, or Latin compendium, 1483, and Heinrich von Louffenburg (1391–1460) &quot;Versehung des Leibs&quot; written in 1429 (published 1491), together form the &quot;Pediatric Incunabula&quot;, four great medical treatises on children&#x27;s physiology and pathology.

While more information about childhood diseases became available, there was little evidence that children received the same kind of medical care that adults did. It was during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that medical experts started offering specialized care for children. The Swedish physician Nils Rosén von Rosenstein (1706–1773) is considered to be the founder of modern pediatrics as a medical specialty, while his work &quot;The diseases of children, and their remedies&quot; (1764) is considered to be &quot;the first modern textbook on the subject&quot;. However, it was not until the nineteenth century that medical professionals acknowledged pediatrics as a separate field of medicine. The first pediatric-specific publications appeared between the 1790s and the 1920s.

===Etymology===
The term pediatrics was first introduced in English in 1859 by Abraham Jacobi. In 1860, he became &quot;the first dedicated professor of pediatrics in the world.&quot; Jacobi is known as the &quot;father of American pediatrics&quot; because of his many contributions to the field. He received his medical training in Germany and later practiced in New York City.

The first generally accepted pediatric hospital is the &quot;Hôpital des Enfants Malades&quot; (), which opened in Paris in June 1802 on the site of a previous orphanage. From its beginning, this famous hospital accepted patients up to the age of fifteen years, and it continues to this day as the pediatric division of the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, created in 1920 by merging with the nearby &quot;Necker Hospital&quot;, founded in 1778.

In other European countries, the Charité (a hospital founded in 1710) in Berlin established a separate Pediatric Pavilion in 1830, followed by similar institutions at Saint Petersburg in 1834, and at Vienna and Breslau (now Wrocław), both in 1837. In 1852 Britain&#x27;s first pediatric hospital, the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street was founded by Charles West. The first Children&#x27;s hospital in Scotland opened in 1860 in Edinburgh. In the US, the first similar institutions were the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia, which opened in 1855, and then Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital (1869). Subspecialties in pediatrics were created at the Harriet Lane Home at Johns Hopkins by Edwards A. Park.

==Differences between adult and pediatric medicine==
The body size differences are paralleled by maturation changes. The smaller body of an infant or neonate is substantially different physiologically from that of an adult. Congenital defects, genetic variance, and developmental issues are of greater concern to pediatricians than they often are to adult physicians. A common adage is that children are not simply &quot;little adults&quot;. The clinician must take into account the immature physiology of the infant or child when considering symptoms, prescribing medications, and diagnosing illnesses.

Pediatric physiology directly impacts the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs that enter the body. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medications differ between developing children and grown adults. Despite completed studies and reviews, continual research is needed to better understand how these factors should affect the decisions of healthcare providers when prescribing and administering medications to the pediatric population.

=== Absorption ===
Many drug absorption differences between pediatric and adult populations revolve around the stomach. Neonates and young infants have increased stomach pH due to decreased acid secretion, thereby creating a more basic environment for drugs that are taken by mouth. Acid is essential to degrading certain oral drugs before systemic absorption. Therefore, the absorption of these drugs in children is greater than in adults due to decreased breakdown and increased preservation in a less acidic gastric space.

Children also have an extended rate of gastric emptying, which slows the rate of drug absorption.

Drug absorption also depends on specific enzymes that come in contact with the oral drug as it travels through the body. Supply of these enzymes increase as children continue to develop their gastrointestinal tract. Pediatric patients have underdeveloped proteins, which leads to decreased metabolism and increased serum concentrations of specific drugs. However, prodrugs experience the opposite effect because enzymes are necessary for allowing their active form to enter systemic circulation.

=== Distribution ===
Percentage of total body water and extracellular fluid volume both decrease as children grow and develop with time. Pediatric patients thus have a larger volume of distribution than adults, which directly affects the dosing of hydrophilic drugs such as beta-lactam antibiotics like ampicillin. Thus, these drugs are administered at greater weight-based doses or with adjusted dosing intervals in children to account for this key difference in body composition.

Infants and neonates also have fewer plasma proteins. Thus, highly protein-bound drugs have fewer opportunities for protein binding, leading to increased distribution.

=== Metabolism ===
Drug metabolism primarily occurs via enzymes in the liver and can vary according to which specific enzymes are affected in a specific stage of development. Phase I and Phase II enzymes have different rates of maturation and development, depending on their specific mechanism of action (i.e. oxidation, hydrolysis, acetylation, methylation, etc.). Enzyme capacity, clearance, and half-life are all factors that contribute to metabolism differences between children and adults. Drug metabolism can even differ within the pediatric population, separating neonates and infants from young children.

=== Elimination ===
Drug elimination is primarily facilitated via the liver and kidneys. In infants and young children, the larger relative size of their kidneys leads to increased renal clearance of medications that are eliminated through urine. In preterm neonates and infants, their kidneys are slower to mature and thus are unable to clear as much drug as fully developed kidneys. This can cause unwanted drug build-up, which is why it is important to consider lower doses and greater dosing intervals for this population. Diseases that negatively affect kidney function can also have the same effect and thus warrant similar considerations.

== Pediatric autonomy in healthcare ==
A major difference between the practice of pediatric and adult medicine is that children, in most jurisdictions and with certain exceptions, cannot make decisions for themselves. The issues of guardianship, privacy, legal responsibility, and informed consent must always be considered in every pediatric procedure. Pediatricians often have to treat the parents and sometimes, the family, rather than just the child. Adolescents are in their own legal class, having rights to their own health care decisions in certain circumstances. The concept of legal consent combined with the non-legal consent (assent) of the child when considering treatment options, especially in the face of conditions with poor prognosis or complicated and painful procedures/surgeries, means the pediatrician must take into account the desires of many people, in addition to those of the patient.

=== History of pediatric autonomy ===
The term autonomy is traceable to ethical theory and law, where it states that autonomous individuals can make decisions based on their own logic. Hippocrates was the first to use the term in a medical setting. He created a code of ethics for doctors called the &quot;Hippocratic Oath&quot; that highlighted the importance of putting patients&#x27; interests first, making autonomy for patients a top priority in health care.  

In ancient times, society did not view pediatric medicine as essential or scientific. Experts considered professional medicine unsuitable for treating children. Children also had no rights. Fathers regarded their children as property, so their children&#x27;s health decisions were entrusted to them. As a result, mothers, midwives, &quot;wise women&quot;, and general practitioners treated the children instead of doctors. Since mothers could not rely on professional medicine to take care of their children, they developed their own methods, such as using alkaline soda ash to remove the vernix at birth and treating teething pain with opium or wine. The absence of proper pediatric care, rights, and laws in health care to prioritize children&#x27;s health led to many of their deaths. Ancient Greeks and Romans sometimes even killed healthy female babies and infants with deformities since they had no adequate medical treatment and no laws prohibiting infanticide.

In the twentieth century, medical experts began to put more emphasis on children&#x27;s rights. In 1989, in the United Nations Rights of the Child Convention, medical experts developed the Best Interest Standard of Child to prioritize children&#x27;s rights and best interests. This event marked the onset of pediatric autonomy. In 1995, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) finally acknowledged the Best Interest Standard of a Child as an ethical principle for pediatric decision-making, and it is still being used today.

=== Parental authority and current medical issues ===
The majority of the time, parents have the authority to decide what happens to their child. Philosopher John Locke argued that it is the responsibility of parents to raise their children and that God gave them this authority. In modern society, Jeffrey Blustein, modern philosopher and author of the book &quot;Parents and Children: The Ethics of Family&quot;, argues that parental authority is granted because the child requires parents to satisfy their needs. He believes that parental autonomy is more about parents providing good care for their children and treating them with respect than parents having rights. The researcher Kyriakos Martakis, MD, MSc, explains that research shows parental influence negatively affects children&#x27;s ability to form autonomy. However, involving children in the decision-making process allows children to develop their cognitive skills and create their own opinions and, thus, decisions about their health. Parental authority affects the degree of autonomy the child patient has. As a result, in Argentina, the new National Civil and Commercial Code has enacted various changes to the healthcare system to encourage children and adolescents to develop autonomy. It has become more crucial to let children take accountability for their own health decisions.

In most cases, the pediatrician, parent, and child work as a team to make the best possible medical decision. The pediatrician has the right to intervene for the child&#x27;s welfare and seek advice from an ethics committee. However, in recent studies, authors have denied that complete autonomy is present in pediatric healthcare. The same moral standards should apply to children as they do to adults. In support of this idea is the concept of paternalism, which negates autonomy when it is in the patient&#x27;s interests. This concept aims to keep the child&#x27;s best interests in mind regarding autonomy. Pediatricians can interact with patients and help them make decisions that will benefit them, thus enhancing their autonomy. However, radical theories that question a child&#x27;s moral worth continue to be debated today. Authors often question whether the treatment and equality of a child and an adult should be the same. Author Tamar Schapiro notes that children need nurturing and cannot exercise the same level of authority as adults. Hence, continuing the discussion on whether children are capable of making important health decisions until this day.

=== Modern advancements ===
According to the Subcommittee of Clinical Ethics of the Argentinean Pediatric Society (SAP), children can understand moral feelings at all ages and can make reasonable decisions based on those feelings. Therefore, children and teens are deemed capable of making their own health decisions when they reach the age of 13. Recently, studies made on the decision-making of children have challenged that age to be 12.

Technology has made several modern advancements that contribute to the future development of child autonomy, for example, unsolicited findings (U.F.s) of pediatric exome sequencing. They are findings based on pediatric exome sequencing that explain in greater detail the intellectual disability of a child and predict to what extent it will affect the child in the future. Genetic and intellectual disorders in children make them incapable of making moral decisions, so people look down upon this kind of testing because the child&#x27;s future autonomy is at risk. It is still in question whether parents should request these types of testing for their children. Medical experts argue that it could endanger the autonomous rights the child will possess in the future. However, the parents contend that genetic testing would benefit the welfare of their children since it would allow them to make better health care decisions. Exome sequencing for children and the decision to grant parents the right to request them is a medically ethical issue that many still debate today.

== Education requirements ==

Aspiring medical students will need 4 years of undergraduate courses at a college or university, which will get them a BS, BA or other bachelor&#x27;s degree. After completing college, future pediatricians will need to attend 4 years of medical school (MD/DO/MBBS) and later do 3 more years of residency training, the first year of which is called &quot;internship.&quot; After completing the 3 years of residency, physicians are eligible to become certified in pediatrics by passing a rigorous test that deals with medical conditions related to young children.

In high school, future pediatricians are required to take basic science classes such as biology, chemistry, physics, algebra, geometry, and calculus. It is also advisable to learn a foreign language (preferably Spanish in the United States) and be involved in high school organizations and extracurricular activities. After high school, college students simply need to fulfill the basic science course requirements that most medical schools recommend and will need to prepare to take the MCAT (Medical College Admission Test) in their junior or early senior year in college. Once attending medical school, student courses will focus on basic medical sciences like human anatomy, physiology, chemistry, etc., for the first three years, the second year of which is when medical students start to get hands-on experience with actual patients.

==Training of pediatricians==
The training of pediatricians varies considerably across the world. Depending on jurisdiction and university, a medical degree course may be either undergraduate-entry or graduate-entry. The former commonly takes five or six years and has been usual in the Commonwealth. Entrants to graduate-entry courses (as in the US), usually lasting four or five years, have previously completed a three- or four-year university degree, commonly but by no means always in sciences. Medical graduates hold a degree specific to the country and university in and from which they graduated. This degree qualifies that medical practitioner to become licensed or registered under the laws of that particular country, and sometimes of several countries, subject to requirements for &quot;internship&quot; or &quot;conditional registration&quot;.

Pediatricians must undertake further training in their chosen field. This may take from four to eleven or more years depending on jurisdiction and the degree of specialization.

In the United States, a medical school graduate wishing to specialize in pediatrics must undergo a three-year residency composed of outpatient, inpatient, and critical care rotations. Subspecialties within pediatrics require further training in the form of 3-year fellowships. Subspecialties include critical care, gastroenterology, neurology, infectious disease, hematology/oncology, rheumatology, pulmonology, child abuse, emergency medicine, endocrinology, neonatology, and others.

In most jurisdictions, entry-level degrees are common to all branches of the medical profession, but in some jurisdictions, specialization in pediatrics may begin before completion of this degree. In some jurisdictions, pediatric training is begun immediately following the completion of entry-level training. In other jurisdictions, junior medical doctors must undertake generalist (unstreamed) training for a number of years before commencing pediatric (or any other) specialization. Specialist training is often largely under the control of &quot;&#x27;pediatric organizations&quot; (see below) rather than universities and depends on the jurisdiction.

<text>Physiology (; ) is the scientific study of functions and mechanisms in a living system. As a subdiscipline of biology, physiology focuses on how organisms, organ systems, individual organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out chemical and physical functions in a living system. According to the classes of organisms, the field can be divided into medical physiology, animal physiology, plant physiology, cell physiology, and comparative physiology.

Central to physiological functioning are biophysical and biochemical processes, homeostatic control mechanisms, and communication between cells. &quot;Physiological state&quot; is the condition of normal function. In contrast, &quot;pathological state&quot; refers to abnormal conditions, including human diseases.

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for exceptional scientific achievements in physiology related to the field of medicine.
==Foundations==
Because physiology focuses on the functions and mechanisms of living organisms at all levels, from the molecular and cellular level to the level of whole organisms and populations, its foundations span a range of key disciplines:
* Anatomy is the study of the structure and organization of living organisms, from the microscopic level of cells and tissues to the macroscopic level of organs and systems. Anatomical knowledge is important in physiology because the structure and function of an organism are often dictated by one another.
* Biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes and substances that occur within living organisms. Knowledge of biochemistry provides the foundation for understanding cellular and molecular processes that are essential to the functioning of organisms.
* Biophysics is the study of the physical properties of living organisms and their interactions with their environment. It helps to explain how organisms sense and respond to different stimuli, such as light, sound, and temperature, and how they maintain homeostasis, or a stable internal environment.
* Genetics is the study of heredity and the variation of traits within and between populations. It provides insights into the genetic basis of physiological processes and the ways in which genes interact with the environment to influence an organism&#x27;s phenotype.
* Evolutionary biology is the study of the processes that have led to the diversity of life on Earth. It helps to explain the origin and adaptive significance of physiological processes and the ways in which organisms have evolved to cope with their environment.

==Subdisciplines==
There are many ways to categorize the subdisciplines of physiology:
* based on the taxa studied: human physiology, animal physiology, plant physiology, microbial physiology, viral physiology
* based on the level of organization: cell physiology, molecular physiology, systems physiology, organismal physiology, ecological physiology, integrative physiology
* based on the process that causes physiological variation: developmental physiology, environmental physiology, evolutionary physiology
* based on the ultimate goals of the research: applied physiology (e.g., medical physiology), non-applied (e.g., comparative physiology)

===Subdisciplines by level of organisation===
====Cell physiology====
Although there are differences between animal, plant, and microbial cells, the basic physiological functions of cells can be divided into the processes of cell division, cell signaling, cell growth, and cell metabolism.

===Subdisciplines by taxa===
====Plant physiology====
Plant physiology is a subdiscipline of botany concerned with the functioning of plants. Closely related fields include plant morphology, plant ecology, phytochemistry, cell biology, genetics, biophysics, and molecular biology. Fundamental processes of plant physiology include photosynthesis, respiration, plant nutrition, tropisms, nastic movements, photoperiodism, photomorphogenesis, circadian rhythms, seed germination, dormancy, and stomata function and transpiration. Absorption of water by roots, production of food in the leaves, and growth of shoots towards light are examples of plant physiology.

====Animal physiology====
==== Human physiology ====
Human physiology is the study of how the human body&#x27;s systems and functions work together to maintain a stable internal environment. It includes the study of the nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, and urinary systems, as well as cellular and exercise physiology. Understanding human physiology is essential for diagnosing and treating health conditions and promoting overall wellbeing.
It seeks to understand the mechanisms that work to keep the human body alive and functioning, through scientific enquiry into the nature of mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions of humans, their organs, and the cells of which they are composed. The principal level of focus of physiology is at the level of organs and systems within systems. The endocrine and nervous systems play major roles in the reception and transmission of signals that integrate function in animals. Homeostasis is a major aspect with regard to such interactions within plants as well as animals. The biological basis of the study of physiology, integration refers to the overlap of many functions of the systems of the human body, as well as its accompanied form. It is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways, both electrical and chemical.

Changes in physiology can impact the mental functions of individuals. Examples of this would be the effects of certain medications or toxic levels of substances. Change in behavior as a result of these substances is often used to assess the health of individuals.

Much of the foundation of knowledge in human physiology was provided by animal experimentation. Due to the frequent connection between form and function, physiology and anatomy are intrinsically linked and are studied in tandem as part of a medical curriculum.

===Subdisciplines by research objective===
====Comparative physiology====

Involving evolutionary physiology and environmental physiology, comparative physiology considers the diversity of functional characteristics across organisms.

== History ==

===The classical era===
The study of human physiology as a medical field originates in classical Greece, at the time of Hippocrates (late 5th century BC). Outside of Western tradition, early forms of physiology or anatomy can be reconstructed as having been present at around the same time in China, India and elsewhere. Hippocrates incorporated the theory of humorism, which consisted of four basic substances: earth, water, air and fire. Each substance is known for having a corresponding humor: black bile, phlegm, blood, and yellow bile, respectively. Hippocrates also noted some emotional connections to the four humors, on which Galen would later expand. The critical thinking of Aristotle and his emphasis on the relationship between structure and function marked the beginning of physiology in Ancient Greece. Like Hippocrates, Aristotle took to the humoral theory of disease, which also consisted of four primary qualities in life: hot, cold, wet and dry. Galen (–200 AD) was the first to use experiments to probe the functions of the body. Unlike Hippocrates, Galen argued that humoral imbalances can be located in specific organs, including the entire body. His modification of this theory better equipped doctors to make more precise diagnoses. Galen also played off of Hippocrates&#x27; idea that emotions were also tied to the humors, and added the notion of temperaments: sanguine corresponds with blood; phlegmatic is tied to phlegm; yellow bile is connected to choleric; and black bile corresponds with melancholy. Galen also saw the human body consisting of three connected systems: the brain and nerves, which are responsible for thoughts and sensations; the heart and arteries, which give life; and the liver and veins, which can be attributed to nutrition and growth. Galen was also the founder of experimental physiology. And for the next 1,400 years, Galenic physiology was a powerful and influential tool in medicine.

===Early modern period===
Jean Fernel (1497–1558), a French physician, introduced the term &quot;physiology&quot;. Galen, Ibn al-Nafis, Michael Servetus, Realdo Colombo, Amato Lusitano and William Harvey, are credited as making important discoveries in the circulation of the blood. Santorio Santorio in 1610s was the first to use a device to measure the pulse rate (the &quot;pulsilogium&quot;), and a thermoscope to measure temperature.

In 1791 Luigi Galvani described the role of electricity in the nerves of dissected frogs. In 1811, César Julien Jean Legallois studied respiration in animal dissection and lesions and found the center of respiration in the medulla oblongata. In the same year, Charles Bell finished work on what would later become known as the Bell–Magendie law, which compared functional differences between dorsal and ventral roots of the spinal cord. In 1824, François Magendie described the sensory roots and produced the first evidence of the cerebellum&#x27;s role in equilibration to complete the Bell–Magendie law.

In the 1820s, the French physiologist Henri Milne-Edwards introduced the notion of physiological division of labor, which allowed to &quot;compare and study living things as if they were machines created by the industry of man.&quot; Inspired in the work of Adam Smith, Milne-Edwards wrote that the &quot;body of all living beings, whether animal or plant, resembles a factory ... where the organs, comparable to workers, work incessantly to produce the phenomena that constitute the life of the individual.&quot; In more differentiated organisms, the functional labor could be apportioned between different instruments or systems (called by him as &quot;appareils&quot;).

In 1858, Joseph Lister studied the cause of blood coagulation and inflammation that resulted after previous injuries and surgical wounds. He later discovered and implemented antiseptics in the operating room, and as a result, decreased the death rate from surgery by a substantial amount.

The Physiological Society was founded in London in 1876 as a dining club. The American Physiological Society (APS) is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 1887. The Society is, &quot;devoted to fostering education, scientific research, and dissemination of information in the physiological sciences.&quot;

In 1891, Ivan Pavlov performed research on &quot;conditional responses&quot; that involved dogs&#x27; saliva production in response to a bell and visual stimuli.

In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate, in particular with the 1838 appearance of the Cell theory of Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. It radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells. Claude Bernard&#x27;s (1813–1878) further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of &quot;milieu interieur&quot; (internal environment), which would later be taken up and championed as &quot;homeostasis&quot; by American physiologist Walter B. Cannon in 1929. By homeostasis, Cannon meant &quot;the maintenance of steady states in the body and the physiological processes through which they are regulated.&quot; In other words, the body&#x27;s ability to regulate its internal environment. William Beaumont was the first American to utilize the practical application of physiology.

Nineteenth-century physiologists such as Michael Foster, Max Verworn, and Alfred Binet, based on Haeckel&#x27;s ideas, elaborated what came to be called &quot;general physiology&quot;, a unified science of life based on the cell actions, later renamed in the 20th century as cell biology.

===Late modern period===
In the 20th century, biologists became interested in how organisms other than human beings function, eventually spawning the fields of comparative physiology and ecophysiology. Major figures in these fields include Knut Schmidt-Nielsen and George Bartholomew. Most recently, evolutionary physiology has become a distinct subdiscipline.

In 1920, August Krogh won the Nobel Prize for discovering how, in capillaries, blood flow is regulated.

In 1954, Andrew Huxley and Hugh Huxley, alongside their research team, discovered the sliding filaments in skeletal muscle, known today as the sliding filament theory.

Recently, there have been intense debates about the vitality of physiology as a discipline (Is it dead or alive?). If physiology is perhaps less visible nowadays than during the golden age of the 19th century, it is in large part because the field has given birth to some of the most active domains of today&#x27;s biological sciences, such as neuroscience, endocrinology, and immunology. Furthermore, physiology is still often seen as an integrative discipline, which can put together into a coherent framework data coming from various different domains.

==Notable physiologists==
=== Women in physiology ===
Initially, women were largely excluded from official involvement in any physiological society. The American Physiological Society, for example, was founded in 1887 and included only men in its ranks. In 1902, the American Physiological Society elected Ida Hyde as the first female member of the society. Hyde, a representative of the American Association of University Women and a global advocate for gender equality in education, attempted to promote gender equality in every aspect of science and medicine.

Soon thereafter, in 1913, J.S. Haldane proposed that women be allowed to formally join The Physiological Society, which had been founded in 1876. On 3 July 1915, six women were officially admitted: Florence Buchanan, Winifred Cullis, Ruth Skelton, Sarah C. M. Sowton, Constance Leetham Terry, and Enid M. Tribe. The centenary of the election of women was celebrated in 2015 with the publication of the book &quot;Women Physiologists: Centenary Celebrations And Beyond For The Physiological Society.&quot; ()

Prominent women physiologists include:
* Bodil Schmidt-Nielsen, the first woman president of the American Physiological Society in 1975.
* Gerty Cori, along with her husband Carl Cori, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947 for their discovery of the phosphate-containing form of glucose known as glycogen, as well as its function within eukaryotic metabolic mechanisms for energy production. Moreover, they discovered the Cori cycle, also known as the Lactic acid cycle, which describes how muscle tissue converts glycogen into lactic acid via lactic acid fermentation.
* Barbara McClintock was rewarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of genetic transposition. McClintock is the only female recipient who has won an unshared Nobel Prize.
* Gertrude Elion, along with George Hitchings and Sir James Black, received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1988 for their development of drugs employed in the treatment of several major diseases, such as leukemia, some autoimmune disorders, gout, malaria, and viral herpes.
* Linda B. Buck, along with Richard Axel, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2004 for their discovery of odorant receptors and the complex organization of the olfactory system.
* Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, along with Luc Montagnier, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2008 for their work on the identification of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the cause of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
* Elizabeth Blackburn, along with Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak, was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the genetic composition and function of telomeres and the enzyme called telomerase.
