<text>The number  (; spelled out as &quot;pi&quot;) is a mathematical constant, approximately equal to 3.14159, that is the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter. It appears in many formulae across mathematics and physics, and some of these formulae are commonly used for defining , to avoid relying on the definition of the length of a curve.

The number is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of two integers, although fractions such as formula_1 are commonly used to approximate it. Consequently, its decimal representation never ends, nor enters a permanently repeating pattern. It is a transcendental number, meaning that it cannot be a solution of an algebraic equation involving only finite sums, products, powers, and integers. The transcendence of implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge. The decimal digits of appear to be randomly distributed, but no proof of this conjecture has been found.

For thousands of years, mathematicians have attempted to extend their understanding of , sometimes by computing its value to a high degree of accuracy. Ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Babylonians, required fairly accurate approximations of for practical computations. Around 250BC, the Greek mathematician Archimedes created an algorithm to approximate with arbitrary accuracy. In the 5th century AD, Chinese mathematicians approximated to seven digits, while Indian mathematicians made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques. The first computational formula for , based on infinite series, was discovered a millennium later. The earliest known use of the Greek letter π to represent the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter was by the Welsh mathematician William Jones in 1706. The invention of calculus soon led to the calculation of hundreds of digits of , enough for all practical scientific computations. Nevertheless, in the 20th and 21st centuries, mathematicians and computer scientists have pursued new approaches that, when combined with increasing computational power, extended the decimal representation of to many trillions of digits. These computations are motivated by the development of efficient algorithms to calculate numeric series, as well as the human quest to break records. The extensive computations involved have also been used to test supercomputers as well as stress testing consumer computer hardware.

Because it relates to a circle, is found in many formulae in trigonometry and geometry, especially those concerning circles, ellipses and spheres. It is also found in formulae from other topics in science, such as cosmology, fractals, thermodynamics, mechanics, and electromagnetism. It also appears in areas having little to do with geometry, such as number theory and statistics, and in modern mathematical analysis can be defined without any reference to geometry. The ubiquity of makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants inside and outside of science. Several books devoted to have been published, and record-setting calculations of the digits of often result in news headlines.

== Fundamentals ==

=== Name ===
The symbol used by mathematicians to represent the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter is the lowercase Greek letter, sometimes spelled out as &quot;pi.&quot; In English, is pronounced as &quot;pie&quot; ( ). In mathematical use, the lowercase letter is distinguished from its capitalized and enlarged counterpart , which denotes a product of a sequence, analogous to how denotes summation.

The choice of the symbol is discussed in the section &quot;Adoption of the symbol &quot;.

=== Definition ===

 is commonly defined as the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter :
formula_2

The ratio formula_3 is constant, regardless of the circle&#x27;s size. For example, if a circle has twice the diameter of another circle, it will also have twice the circumference, preserving the ratio formula_3. This definition of implicitly makes use of flat (Euclidean) geometry; although the notion of a circle can be extended to any curve (non-Euclidean) geometry, these new circles will no longer satisfy the formula formula_5.

Here, the circumference of a circle is the arc length around the perimeter of the circle, a quantity which can be formally defined independently of geometry using limits—a concept in calculus. For example, one may directly compute the arc length of the top half of the unit circle, given in Cartesian coordinates by the equation formula_6, as the integral:
formula_7

An integral such as this was proposed as a definition of by Karl Weierstrass, who defined it directly as an integral in 1841.

Integration is no longer commonly used in a first analytical definition because, as explains, differential calculus typically precedes integral calculus in the university curriculum, so it is desirable to have a definition of that does not rely on the latter. One such definition, due to Richard Baltzer and popularized by Edmund Landau, is the following: is twice the smallest positive number at which the cosine function equals 0. is also the smallest positive number at which the sine function equals zero, and the difference between consecutive zeroes of the sine function. The cosine and sine can be defined independently of geometry as a power series, or as the solution of a differential equation.

In a similar spirit, can be defined using properties of the complex exponential, , of a complex variable . Like the cosine, the complex exponential can be defined in one of several ways. The set of complex numbers at which is equal to one is then an (imaginary) arithmetic progression of the form:
formula_8
and there is a unique positive real number with this property.

A variation on the same idea, making use of sophisticated mathematical concepts of topology and algebra, is the following theorem: there is a unique (up to automorphism) continuous isomorphism from the group R/Z of real numbers under addition modulo integers (the circle group), onto the multiplicative group of complex numbers of absolute value one. The number is then defined as half the magnitude of the derivative of this homomorphism.

=== Irrationality and normality ===
 is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be written as the ratio of two integers. Fractions such as and are commonly used to approximate , but no common fraction (ratio of whole numbers) can be its exact value. Because is irrational, it has an infinite number of digits in its decimal representation, and does not settle into an infinitely repeating pattern of digits. There are several proofs that is irrational; they generally require calculus and rely on the &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; technique. The degree to which can be approximated by rational numbers (called the irrationality measure) is not precisely known; estimates have established that the irrationality measure is larger or at least equal to the measure of but smaller than the measure of Liouville numbers.

The digits of have no apparent pattern and have passed tests for statistical randomness, including tests for normality; a number of infinite length is called normal when all possible sequences of digits (of any given length) appear equally often. The conjecture that is normal has not been proven or disproven.

Since the advent of computers, a large number of digits of have been available on which to perform statistical analysis. Yasumasa Kanada has performed detailed statistical analyses on the decimal digits of , and found them consistent with normality; for example, the frequencies of the ten digits 0 to 9 were subjected to statistical significance tests, and no evidence of a pattern was found. Any random sequence of digits contains arbitrarily long subsequences that appear non-random, by the infinite monkey theorem. Thus, because the sequence of &#x27;s digits passes statistical tests for randomness, it contains some sequences of digits that may appear non-random, such as a sequence of six consecutive 9s that begins at the 762nd decimal place of the decimal representation of . This is also called the &quot;Feynman point&quot; in mathematical folklore, after Richard Feynman, although no connection to Feynman is known.

=== Transcendence ===

In addition to being irrational, is also a transcendental number, which means that it is not the solution of any non-constant polynomial equation with rational coefficients, such as formula_9. This follows from the so-called Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, which also establishes the transcendence of the constant &quot;&quot;.

The transcendence of has two important consequences: First, cannot be expressed using any finite combination of rational numbers and square roots or &quot;n&quot;-th roots (such as formula_10 or formula_11). Second, since no transcendental number can be constructed with compass and straightedge, it is not possible to &quot;square the circle&quot;. In other words, it is impossible to construct, using compass and straightedge alone, a square whose area is exactly equal to the area of a given circle. Squaring a circle was one of the important geometry problems of the classical antiquity. Amateur mathematicians in modern times have sometimes attempted to square the circle and claim success—despite the fact that it is mathematically impossible.

An unsolved problem thus far is the question of whether or not the numbers &#x27; and &#x27; are algebraically independent (&quot;relatively transcendental&quot;). This would be resolved by Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture – a currently unproven generalization of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem.

=== Continued fractions ===
As an irrational number, cannot be represented as a common fraction. But every number, including , can be represented by an infinite series of nested fractions, called a simple continued fraction:
formula_12

Truncating the continued fraction at any point yields a rational approximation for ; the first four of these are , , , and . These numbers are among the best-known and most widely used historical approximations of the constant. Each approximation generated in this way is a best rational approximation; that is, each is closer to than any other fraction with the same or a smaller denominator. Because is transcendental, it is by definition not algebraic and so cannot be a quadratic irrational. Therefore, cannot have a periodic continued fraction. Although the simple continued fraction for (with numerators all 1, shown above) also does not exhibit any other obvious pattern, several non-simple continued fractions do, such as:
formula_13

The middle of these is due to the mid-17th century mathematician William Brouncker, see § Brouncker&#x27;s formula.

=== Approximate value and digits ===
Some approximations of &quot;pi&quot; include:
* Integers: 3
* Fractions: Approximate fractions include (in order of increasing accuracy) , , , , , , and . (List is selected terms from and .)
* Digits: The first 50 decimal digits are (see )

Digits in other number systems
* The first 48 binary (base 2) digits (called bits) are (see )
* The first 36 digits in ternary (base 3) are (see )
* The first 20 digits in hexadecimal (base 16) are (see )
* The first five sexagesimal (base 60) digits are 3;8,29,44,0,47 (see )

=== Complex numbers and Euler&#x27;s identity ===
Any complex number, say , can be expressed using a pair of real numbers. In the polar coordinate system, one number (radius or ) is used to represent &#x27;s distance from the origin of the complex plane, and the other (angle or ) the counter-clockwise rotation from the positive real line:
formula_14
where is the imaginary unit satisfying formula_15. The frequent appearance of in complex analysis can be related to the behaviour of the exponential function of a complex variable, described by Euler&#x27;s formula:
formula_16
where the constant is the base of the natural logarithm. This formula establishes a correspondence between imaginary powers of and points on the unit circle centred at the origin of the complex plane. Setting formula_17 in Euler&#x27;s formula results in Euler&#x27;s identity, celebrated in mathematics due to it containing five important mathematical constants:
formula_18

There are different complex numbers satisfying formula_19, and these are called the &quot;-th roots of unity&quot; and are given by the formula:
formula_20

== History ==


=== Antiquity ===
The best-known approximations to dating before the Common Era were accurate to two decimal places; this was improved upon in Chinese mathematics in particular by the mid-first millennium, to an accuracy of seven decimal places.
After this, no further progress was made until the late medieval period.

The earliest written approximations of are found in Babylon and Egypt, both within one percent of the true value. In Babylon, a clay tablet dated 1900–1600 BC has a geometrical statement that, by implication, treats as  = 3.125. In Egypt, the Rhind Papyrus, dated around 1650 BC but copied from a document dated to 1850 BC, has a formula for the area of a circle that treats as formula_21. Although some pyramidologists have theorized that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built with proportions related to , this theory is not widely accepted by scholars.
In the Shulba Sutras of Indian mathematics, dating to an oral tradition from the first or second millennium BC, approximations are given which have been variously interpreted as approximately 3.08831, 3.08833, 3.004, 3, or 3.125.

=== Polygon approximation era ===

The first recorded algorithm for rigorously calculating the value of was a geometrical approach using polygons, devised around 250 BC by the Greek mathematician Archimedes, implementing the method of exhaustion. This polygonal algorithm dominated for over 1,000 years, and as a result is sometimes referred to as Archimedes&#x27;s constant. Archimedes computed upper and lower bounds of by drawing a regular hexagon inside and outside a circle, and successively doubling the number of sides until he reached a 96-sided regular polygon. By calculating the perimeters of these polygons, he proved that (that is, ). Archimedes&#x27; upper bound of may have led to a widespread popular belief that is equal to . Around 150 AD, Greek-Roman scientist Ptolemy, in his &quot;Almagest&quot;, gave a value for of 3.1416, which he may have obtained from Archimedes or from Apollonius of Perga. Mathematicians using polygonal algorithms reached 39 digits of in 1630, a record only broken in 1699 when infinite series were used to reach 71 digits.

In ancient China, values for included 3.1547 (around 1 AD), formula_11 (100 AD, approximately 3.1623), and (3rd century, approximately 3.1556). Around 265 AD, the Wei Kingdom mathematician Liu Hui created a polygon-based iterative algorithm and used it with a 3,072-sided polygon to obtain a value of of 3.1416. Liu later invented a faster method of calculating and obtained a value of 3.14 with a 96-sided polygon, by taking advantage of the fact that the differences in area of successive polygons form a geometric series with a factor of 4. The Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi, around 480 AD, calculated that formula_23 and suggested the approximations formula_24 and formula_25, which he termed the &quot;Milü&quot; (&quot;close ratio&quot;) and &quot;Yuelü&quot; (&quot;approximate ratio&quot;), respectively, using Liu Hui&#x27;s algorithm applied to a 12,288-sided polygon. With a correct value for its seven first decimal digits, this value remained the most accurate approximation of available for the next 800 years.

The Indian astronomer Aryabhata used a value of 3.1416 in his &quot;Āryabhaṭīya&quot; (499 AD). Fibonacci in computed 3.1418 using a polygonal method, independent of Archimedes. Italian author Dante apparently employed the value formula_26.

The Persian astronomer Jamshīd al-Kāshī produced nine sexagesimal digits, roughly the equivalent of 16 decimal digits, in 1424, using a polygon with formula_27 sides, which stood as the world record for about 180 years. French mathematician François Viète in 1579 achieved nine digits with a polygon of formula_28 sides. Flemish mathematician Adriaan van Roomen arrived at 15 decimal places in 1593. In 1596, Dutch mathematician Ludolph van Ceulen reached 20 digits, a record he later increased to 35 digits (as a result, was called the &quot;Ludolphian number&quot; in Germany until the early 20th century). Dutch scientist Willebrord Snellius reached 34 digits in 1621, and Austrian astronomer Christoph Grienberger arrived at 38 digits in 1630 using 1040 sides. Christiaan Huygens was able to arrive at 10 decimal places in 1654 using a slightly different method equivalent to Richardson extrapolation.

=== Infinite series ===

The calculation of was revolutionized by the development of infinite series techniques in the 16th and 17th centuries. An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence. Infinite series allowed mathematicians to compute with much greater precision than Archimedes and others who used geometrical techniques. Although infinite series were exploited for most notably by European mathematicians such as James Gregory and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the approach also appeared in the Kerala school sometime in the 14th or 15th century. Around 1500 AD, a written description of an infinite series that could be used to compute was laid out in Sanskrit verse in &quot;Tantrasamgraha&quot; by Nilakantha Somayaji. The series are presented without proof, but proofs are presented in a later work, &quot;Yuktibhāṣā&quot;, from around 1530 AD. Several infinite series are described, including series for sine (which Nilakantha attributes to Madhava of Sangamagrama), cosine, and arctangent which are now sometimes referred to as Madhava series. The series for arctangent is sometimes called Gregory&#x27;s series or the Gregory–Leibniz series. Madhava used infinite series to estimate to 11 digits around 1400.

In 1593, François Viète published what is now known as Viète&#x27;s formula, an infinite product (rather than an infinite sum, which is more typically used in calculations):
formula_29

In 1655, John Wallis published what is now known as Wallis product, also an infinite product:
formula_30
In the 1660s, the English scientist Isaac Newton and German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz discovered calculus, which led to the development of many infinite series for approximating . Newton himself used an arcsine series to compute a 15-digit approximation of in 1665 or 1666, writing, &quot;I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these computations, having no other business at the time.&quot;

In 1671, James Gregory, and independently, Leibniz in 1673, discovered the Taylor series expansion for arctangent:
formula_31

This series, sometimes called the Gregory–Leibniz series, equals formula_32 when evaluated with formula_33. But for formula_33, it converges impractically slowly (that is, approaches the answer very gradually), taking about ten times as many terms to calculate each additional digit.

In 1699, English mathematician Abraham Sharp used the Gregory–Leibniz series for formula_35 to compute to 71 digits, breaking the previous record of 39 digits, which was set with a polygonal algorithm.

In 1706, John Machin used the Gregory–Leibniz series to produce an algorithm that converged much faster:
formula_36

Machin reached 100 digits of with this formula. Other mathematicians created variants, now known as Machin-like formulae, that were used to set several successive records for calculating digits of .

Isaac Newton accelerated the convergence of the Gregory–Leibniz series in 1684 (in an unpublished work; others independently discovered the result):
: formula_37

Leonhard Euler popularized this series in his 1755 differential calculus textbook, and later used it with Machin-like formulae, including formula_38 with which he computed 20 digits of in one hour.

Machin-like formulae remained the best-known method for calculating well into the age of computers, and were used to set records for 250 years, culminating in a 620-digit approximation in 1946 by Daniel Ferguson – the best approximation achieved without the aid of a calculating device.

In 1844, a record was set by Zacharias Dase, who employed a Machin-like formula to calculate 200 decimals of in his head at the behest of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss.

In 1853, British mathematician William Shanks calculated to 607 digits, but made a mistake in the 528th digit, rendering all subsequent digits incorrect. Though he calculated an additional 100 digits in 1873, bringing the total up to 707, his previous mistake rendered all the new digits incorrect as well.

==== Rate of convergence ====
Some infinite series for converge faster than others. Given the choice of two infinite series for , mathematicians will generally use the one that converges more rapidly because faster convergence reduces the amount of computation needed to calculate to any given accuracy. A simple infinite series for is the Gregory–Leibniz series:
formula_39

As individual terms of this infinite series are added to the sum, the total gradually gets closer to , and – with a sufficient number of terms – can get as close to as desired. It converges quite slowly, though – after 500,000 terms, it produces only five correct decimal digits of .

An infinite series for (published by Nilakantha in the 15th century) that converges more rapidly than the Gregory–Leibniz series is:
formula_40

The following table compares the convergence rates of these two series:

After five terms, the sum of the Gregory–Leibniz series is within 0.2 of the correct value of , whereas the sum of Nilakantha&#x27;s series is within 0.002 of the correct value. Nilakantha&#x27;s series converges faster and is more useful for computing digits of . Series that converge even faster include Machin&#x27;s series and Chudnovsky&#x27;s series, the latter producing 14 correct decimal digits per term.

=== Irrationality and transcendence ===

Not all mathematical advances relating to were aimed at increasing the accuracy of approximations. When Euler solved the Basel problem in 1735, finding the exact value of the sum of the reciprocal squares, he established a connection between and the prime numbers that later contributed to the development and study of the Riemann zeta function:

formula_41

Swiss scientist Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1768 proved that is irrational, meaning it is not equal to the quotient of any two integers. Lambert&#x27;s proof exploited a continued-fraction representation of the tangent function. French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre proved in 1794 that 2 is also irrational. In 1882, German mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann proved that is transcendental, confirming a conjecture made by both Legendre and Euler. Hardy and Wright states that &quot;the proofs were afterwards modified and simplified by Hilbert, Hurwitz, and other writers&quot;.

=== Adoption of the symbol ===
The first recorded use of the symbol in circle geometry is in Oughtred&#x27;s &quot;Clavis Mathematicae&quot; (1648),
where the Greek letters and &quot;δ&quot; were combined into the fraction for denoting the ratios semiperimeter to semidiameter and perimeter to diameter, that is, what is presently denoted as . (Before then, mathematicians sometimes used letters such as &quot;c&quot; or &quot;p&quot; instead.) Barrow likewise used the same notation, while Gregory instead used formula_42 to represent .

The earliest known use of the Greek letter alone to represent the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician William Jones in his 1706 work &quot;; or, a New Introduction to the Mathematics&quot;. The Greek letter appears on p. 243 in the phrase &quot;formula_43 Periphery ()&quot;, calculated for a circle with radius one. However, Jones writes that his equations for are from the &quot;ready pen of the truly ingenious Mr. John Machin&quot;, leading to speculation that Machin may have employed the Greek letter before Jones. Jones&#x27; notation was not immediately adopted by other mathematicians, with the fraction notation still being used as late as 1767.

Euler started using the single-letter form beginning with his 1727 &quot;Essay Explaining the Properties of Air&quot;, though he used , the ratio of periphery to radius, in this and some later writing. Euler first used in his 1736 work &quot;Mechanica&quot;, and continued in his widely read 1748 work (he wrote: &quot;for the sake of brevity we will write this number as ; thus is equal to half the circumference of a circle of radius &quot;). Because Euler corresponded heavily with other mathematicians in Europe, the use of the Greek letter spread rapidly, and the practice was universally adopted thereafter in the Western world, though the definition still varied between and as late as 1761.

== Modern quest for more digits ==

=== Computer era and iterative algorithms ===
The development of computers in the mid-20th century again revolutionized the hunt for digits of . Mathematicians John Wrench and Levi Smith reached 1,120 digits in 1949 using a desk calculator. Using an inverse tangent (arctan) infinite series, a team led by George Reitwiesner and John von Neumann that same year achieved 2,037 digits with a calculation that took 70 hours of computer time on the ENIAC computer. The record, always relying on an arctan series, was broken repeatedly (3089 digits in 1955, 7,480 digits in 1957; 10,000 digits in 1958; 100,000 digits in 1961) until 1 million digits was reached in 1973.

Two additional developments around 1980 once again accelerated the ability to compute . First, the discovery of new iterative algorithms for computing , which were much faster than the infinite series; and second, the invention of fast multiplication algorithms that could multiply large numbers very rapidly. Such algorithms are particularly important in modern computations because most of the computer&#x27;s time is devoted to multiplication. They include the Karatsuba algorithm, Toom–Cook multiplication, and Fourier transform-based methods.

The iterative algorithms were independently published in 1975–1976 by physicist Eugene Salamin and scientist Richard Brent. These avoid reliance on infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs, and produces a result in each step that converges to the desired value. The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by Carl Friedrich Gauss, in what is now termed the arithmetic–geometric mean method (AGM method) or Gauss–Legendre algorithm. As modified by Salamin and Brent, it is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm.

The iterative algorithms were widely used after 1980 because they are faster than infinite series algorithms: whereas infinite series typically increase the number of correct digits additively in successive terms, iterative algorithms generally &quot;multiply&quot; the number of correct digits at each step. For example, the Brent–Salamin algorithm doubles the number of digits in each iteration. In 1984, brothers John and Peter Borwein produced an iterative algorithm that quadruples the number of digits in each step; and in 1987, one that increases the number of digits five times in each step. Iterative methods were used by Japanese mathematician Yasumasa Kanada to set several records for computing between 1995 and 2002. This rapid convergence comes at a price: the iterative algorithms require significantly more memory than infinite series.

=== Motives for computing ===

For most numerical calculations involving , a handful of digits provide sufficient precision. According to Jörg Arndt and Christoph Haenel, thirty-nine digits are sufficient to perform most cosmological calculations, because that is the accuracy necessary to calculate the circumference of the observable universe with a precision of one atom. Accounting for additional digits needed to compensate for computational round-off errors, Arndt concludes that a few hundred digits would suffice for any scientific application. Despite this, people have worked strenuously to compute to thousands and millions of digits. This effort may be partly ascribed to the human compulsion to break records, and such achievements with often make headlines around the world. They also have practical benefits, such as testing supercomputers, testing numerical analysis algorithms (including high-precision multiplication algorithms); and within pure mathematics itself, providing data for evaluating the randomness of the digits of .

=== Rapidly convergent series ===

Modern calculators do not use iterative algorithms exclusively. New infinite series were discovered in the 1980s and 1990s that are as fast as iterative algorithms, yet are simpler and less memory intensive. The fast iterative algorithms were anticipated in 1914, when Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan published dozens of innovative new formulae for , remarkable for their elegance, mathematical depth and rapid convergence. One of his formulae, based on modular equations, is
formula_44

This series converges much more rapidly than most arctan series, including Machin&#x27;s formula. Bill Gosper was the first to use it for advances in the calculation of , setting a record of 17 million digits in 1985. Ramanujan&#x27;s formulae anticipated the modern algorithms developed by the Borwein brothers (Jonathan and Peter) and the Chudnovsky brothers. The Chudnovsky formula developed in 1987 is
formula_45

It produces about 14 digits of per term and has been used for several record-setting calculations, including the first to surpass 1 billion (109) digits in 1989 by the Chudnovsky brothers, 10 trillion (1013) digits in 2011 by Alexander Yee and Shigeru Kondo, and 100 trillion digits by Emma Haruka Iwao in 2022. For similar formulae, see also the Ramanujan–Sato series.

In 2006, mathematician Simon Plouffe used the PSLQ integer relation algorithm to generate several new formulae for , conforming to the following template:
formula_46
where is (Gelfond&#x27;s constant), is an odd number, and are certain rational numbers that Plouffe computed.

=== Monte Carlo methods ===

Monte Carlo methods, which evaluate the results of multiple random trials, can be used to create approximations of . Buffon&#x27;s needle is one such technique: If a needle of length is dropped times on a surface on which parallel lines are drawn units apart, and if of those times it comes to rest crossing a line ( &gt; 0), then one may approximate based on the counts:
formula_47

Another Monte Carlo method for computing is to draw a circle inscribed in a square, and randomly place dots in the square. The ratio of dots inside the circle to the total number of dots will approximately equal .
Another way to calculate using probability is to start with a random walk, generated by a sequence of (fair) coin tosses: independent random variables such that with equal probabilities. The associated random walk is
formula_48
so that, for each , is drawn from a shifted and scaled binomial distribution. As varies, defines a (discrete) stochastic process. Then can be calculated by
formula_49

This Monte Carlo method is independent of any relation to circles, and is a consequence of the central limit theorem, discussed below.

These Monte Carlo methods for approximating are very slow compared to other methods, and do not provide any information on the exact number of digits that are obtained. Thus they are never used to approximate when speed or accuracy is desired.

=== Spigot algorithms ===
Two algorithms were discovered in 1995 that opened up new avenues of research into . They are called spigot algorithms because, like water dripping from a spigot, they produce single digits of that are not reused after they are calculated. This is in contrast to infinite series or iterative algorithms, which retain and use all intermediate digits until the final result is produced.

Mathematicians Stan Wagon and Stanley Rabinowitz produced a simple spigot algorithm in 1995. Its speed is comparable to arctan algorithms, but not as fast as iterative algorithms.

Another spigot algorithm, the BBP digit extraction algorithm, was discovered in 1995 by Simon Plouffe:
formula_50

This formula, unlike others before it, can produce any individual hexadecimal digit of without calculating all the preceding digits. Individual binary digits may be extracted from individual hexadecimal digits, and octal digits can be extracted from one or two hexadecimal digits. An important application of digit extraction algorithms is to validate new claims of record computations: After a new record is claimed, the decimal result is converted to hexadecimal, and then a digit extraction algorithm is used to calculate several randomly selected hexadecimal digits near the end; if they match, this provides a measure of confidence that the entire computation is correct.

Between 1998 and 2000, the distributed computing project PiHex used Bellard&#x27;s formula (a modification of the BBP algorithm) to compute the quadrillionth (1015th) bit of , which turned out to be 0. In September 2010, a Yahoo! employee used the company&#x27;s Hadoop application on one thousand computers over a 23-day period to compute 256 bits of at the two-quadrillionth (2×1015th) bit, which also happens to be zero.

In 2022, Plouffe found a base-10 algorithm for calculating digits of .

== Role and characterizations in mathematics ==
Because is closely related to the circle, it is found in many formulae from the fields of geometry and trigonometry, particularly those concerning circles, spheres, or ellipses. Other branches of science, such as statistics, physics, Fourier analysis, and number theory, also include in some of their important formulae.

=== Geometry and trigonometry ===
 appears in formulae for areas and volumes of geometrical shapes based on circles, such as ellipses, spheres, cones, and tori. Below are some of the more common formulae that involve .
* The circumference of a circle with radius is .
* The area of a circle with radius is .
* The area of an ellipse with semi-major axis and semi-minor axis is .
* The volume of a sphere with radius is .
* The surface area of a sphere with radius is .
Some of the formulae above are special cases of the volume of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional ball and the surface area of its boundary, the (&quot;n&quot;−1)-dimensional sphere, given below.

Apart from circles, there are other curves of constant width. By Barbier&#x27;s theorem, every curve of constant width has perimeter times its width. The Reuleaux triangle (formed by the intersection of three circles with the sides of an equilateral triangle as their radii) has the smallest possible area for its width and the circle the largest. There also exist non-circular smooth and even algebraic curves of constant width.

Definite integrals that describe circumference, area, or volume of shapes generated by circles typically have values that involve . For example, an integral that specifies half the area of a circle of radius one is given by:
formula_51

In that integral, the function formula_52 represents the height over the formula_53-axis of a semicircle (the square root is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem), and the integral computes the area below the semicircle.

The existence of such integrals makes an algebraic period.

=== Units of angle ===

The trigonometric functions rely on angles, and mathematicians generally use radians as units of measurement. plays an important role in angles measured in radians, which are defined so that a complete circle spans an angle of 2 radians. The angle measure of 180° is equal to radians, and .

Common trigonometric functions have periods that are multiples of ; for example, sine and cosine have period 2, so for any angle and any integer ,
formula_54

=== Eigenvalues ===

Many of the appearances of in the formulae of mathematics and the sciences have to do with its close relationship with geometry. However, also appears in many natural situations having apparently nothing to do with geometry.

In many applications, it plays a distinguished role as an eigenvalue. For example, an idealized vibrating string can be modelled as the graph of a function on the unit interval , with fixed ends . The modes of vibration of the string are solutions of the differential equation formula_55, or formula_56. Thus is an eigenvalue of the second derivative operator formula_57, and is constrained by Sturm–Liouville theory to take on only certain specific values. It must be positive, since the operator is negative definite, so it is convenient to write , where is called the wavenumber. Then satisfies the boundary conditions and the differential equation with .

The value is, in fact, the &quot;least&quot; such value of the wavenumber, and is associated with the fundamental mode of vibration of the string. One way to show this is by estimating the energy, which satisfies Wirtinger&#x27;s inequality: for a function formula_58 with and , both square integrable, we have:
formula_59
with equality precisely when is a multiple of . Here appears as an optimal constant in Wirtinger&#x27;s inequality, and it follows that it is the smallest wavenumber, using the variational characterization of the eigenvalue. As a consequence, is the smallest singular value of the derivative operator on the space of functions on vanishing at both endpoints (the Sobolev space formula_60).

=== Inequalities ===
The number serves appears in similar eigenvalue problems in higher-dimensional analysis. As mentioned above, it can be characterized via its role as the best constant in the isoperimetric inequality: the area enclosed by a plane Jordan curve of perimeter satisfies the inequality
formula_61
and equality is clearly achieved for the circle, since in that case and .

Ultimately, as a consequence of the isoperimetric inequality, appears in the optimal constant for the critical Sobolev inequality in &quot;n&quot; dimensions, which thus characterizes the role of in many physical phenomena as well, for example those of classical potential theory. In two dimensions, the critical Sobolev inequality is
formula_62
for &quot;f&quot; a smooth function with compact support in , formula_63 is the gradient of &quot;f&quot;, and formula_64 and formula_65 refer respectively to the and -norm. The Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the isoperimetric inequality (in any dimension), with the same best constants.

Wirtinger&#x27;s inequality also generalizes to higher-dimensional Poincaré inequalities that provide best constants for the Dirichlet energy of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional membrane. Specifically, is the greatest constant such that
formula_66
for all convex subsets of of diameter 1, and square-integrable functions &quot;u&quot; on of mean zero. Just as Wirtinger&#x27;s inequality is the variational form of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem in one dimension, the Poincaré inequality is the variational form of the Neumann eigenvalue problem, in any dimension.

=== Fourier transform and Heisenberg uncertainty principle ===

The constant also appears as a critical spectral parameter in the Fourier transform. This is the integral transform, that takes a complex-valued integrable function on the real line to the function defined as:
formula_67

Although there are several different conventions for the Fourier transform and its inverse, any such convention must involve &quot;somewhere&quot;. The above is the most canonical definition, however, giving the unique unitary operator on that is also an algebra homomorphism of to .

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle also contains the number . The uncertainty principle gives a sharp lower bound on the extent to which it is possible to localize a function both in space and in frequency: with our conventions for the Fourier transform,
formula_68

The physical consequence, about the uncertainty in simultaneous position and momentum observations of a quantum mechanical system, is discussed below. The appearance of in the formulae of Fourier analysis is ultimately a consequence of the Stone–von Neumann theorem, asserting the uniqueness of the Schrödinger representation of the Heisenberg group.

=== Gaussian integrals ===
The fields of probability and statistics frequently use the normal distribution as a simple model for complex phenomena; for example, scientists generally assume that the observational error in most experiments follows a normal distribution. The Gaussian function, which is the probability density function of the normal distribution with mean and standard deviation , naturally contains :
formula_69

The factor of formula_70 makes the area under the graph of equal to one, as is required for a probability distribution. This follows from a change of variables in the Gaussian integral:
formula_71
which says that the area under the basic bell curve in the figure is equal to the square root of .

The central limit theorem explains the central role of normal distributions, and thus of , in probability and statistics. This theorem is ultimately connected with the spectral characterization of as the eigenvalue associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and the fact that equality holds in the uncertainty principle only for the Gaussian function. Equivalently, is the unique constant making the Gaussian normal distribution equal to its own Fourier transform. Indeed, according to , the &quot;whole business&quot; of establishing the fundamental theorems of Fourier analysis reduces to the Gaussian integral.

=== Topology ===

The constant appears in the Gauss–Bonnet formula which relates the differential geometry of surfaces to their topology. Specifically, if a compact surface has Gauss curvature &quot;K&quot;, then
formula_72
where is the Euler characteristic, which is an integer. An example is the surface area of a sphere &quot;S&quot; of curvature 1 (so that its radius of curvature, which coincides with its radius, is also 1.) The Euler characteristic of a sphere can be computed from its homology groups and is found to be equal to two. Thus we have
formula_73
reproducing the formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius 1.

The constant appears in many other integral formulae in topology, in particular, those involving characteristic classes via the Chern–Weil homomorphism.

=== Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula ===
One of the key tools in complex analysis is contour integration of a function over a positively oriented (rectifiable) Jordan curve . A form of Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula states that if a point is interior to , then
formula_74

Although the curve is not a circle, and hence does not have any obvious connection to the constant , a standard proof of this result uses Morera&#x27;s theorem, which implies that the integral is invariant under homotopy of the curve, so that it can be deformed to a circle and then integrated explicitly in polar coordinates. More generally, it is true that if a rectifiable closed curve does not contain , then the above integral is times the winding number of the curve.

The general form of Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula establishes the relationship between the values of a complex analytic function on the Jordan curve and the value of at any interior point of :
formula_75
provided is analytic in the region enclosed by and extends continuously to . Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula is a special case of the residue theorem, that if is a meromorphic function the region enclosed by and is continuous in a neighbourhood of , then
formula_76
where the sum is of the residues at the poles of .

=== Vector calculus and physics ===
The constant is ubiquitous in vector calculus and potential theory, for example in Coulomb&#x27;s law, Gauss&#x27;s law, Maxwell&#x27;s equations, and even the Einstein field equations. Perhaps the simplest example of this is the two-dimensional Newtonian potential, representing the potential of a point source at the origin, whose associated field has unit outward flux through any smooth and oriented closed surface enclosing the source:
formula_77
The factor of formula_78 is necessary to ensure that formula_79 is the fundamental solution of the Poisson equation in formula_80:
formula_81
where formula_82 is the Dirac delta function.

In higher dimensions, factors of are present because of a normalization by the n-dimensional volume of the unit n sphere. For example, in three dimensions, the Newtonian potential is:
formula_83
which has the 2-dimensional volume (i.e., the area) of the unit 2-sphere in the denominator.

=== Total curvature ===
=== The gamma function and Stirling&#x27;s approximation ===

The factorial function formula_84 is the product of all of the positive integers through . The gamma function extends the concept of factorial (normally defined only for non-negative integers) to all complex numbers, except the negative real integers, with the identity formula_85. When the gamma function is evaluated at half-integers, the result contains . For example, formula_86 and formula_87.

The gamma function is defined by its Weierstrass product development:
formula_88
where is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. Evaluated at and squared, the equation reduces to the Wallis product formula. The gamma function is also connected to the Riemann zeta function and identities for the functional determinant, in which the constant plays an important role.

The gamma function is used to calculate the volume of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional ball of radius &quot;r&quot; in Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space, and the surface area of its boundary, the (&quot;n&quot;−1)-dimensional sphere:
formula_89
formula_90

Further, it follows from the functional equation that
formula_91

The gamma function can be used to create a simple approximation to the factorial function for large : formula_92 which is known as Stirling&#x27;s approximation. Equivalently,
formula_93

As a geometrical application of Stirling&#x27;s approximation, let denote the standard simplex in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space, and denote the simplex having all of its sides scaled up by a factor of . Then
formula_94

Ehrhart&#x27;s volume conjecture is that this is the (optimal) upper bound on the volume of a convex body containing only one lattice point.

=== Number theory and Riemann zeta function ===
The Riemann zeta function is used in many areas of mathematics. When evaluated at it can be written as
formula_95

Finding a simple solution for this infinite series was a famous problem in mathematics called the Basel problem. Leonhard Euler solved it in 1735 when he showed it was equal to . Euler&#x27;s result leads to the number theory result that the probability of two random numbers being relatively prime (that is, having no shared factors) is equal to . This probability is based on the observation that the probability that any number is divisible by a prime is (for example, every 7th integer is divisible by 7.) Hence the probability that two numbers are both divisible by this prime is , and the probability that at least one of them is not is . For distinct primes, these divisibility events are mutually independent; so the probability that two numbers are relatively prime is given by a product over all primes:
formula_96

This probability can be used in conjunction with a random number generator to approximate using a Monte Carlo approach.

The solution to the Basel problem implies that the geometrically derived quantity is connected in a deep way to the distribution of prime numbers. This is a special case of Weil&#x27;s conjecture on Tamagawa numbers, which asserts the equality of similar such infinite products of &quot;arithmetic&quot; quantities, localized at each prime &quot;p&quot;, and a &quot;geometrical&quot; quantity: the reciprocal of the volume of a certain locally symmetric space. In the case of the Basel problem, it is the hyperbolic 3-manifold .

The zeta function also satisfies Riemann&#x27;s functional equation, which involves as well as the gamma function:
formula_97

Furthermore, the derivative of the zeta function satisfies
formula_98

A consequence is that can be obtained from the functional determinant of the harmonic oscillator. This functional determinant can be computed via a product expansion, and is equivalent to the Wallis product formula. The calculation can be recast in quantum mechanics, specifically the variational approach to the spectrum of the hydrogen atom.

=== Fourier series ===

The constant also appears naturally in Fourier series of periodic functions. Periodic functions are functions on the group of fractional parts of real numbers. The Fourier decomposition shows that a complex-valued function on can be written as an infinite linear superposition of unitary characters of . That is, continuous group homomorphisms from to the circle group of unit modulus complex numbers. It is a theorem that every character of is one of the complex exponentials formula_99.

There is a unique character on , up to complex conjugation, that is a group isomorphism. Using the Haar measure on the circle group, the constant is half the magnitude of the Radon–Nikodym derivative of this character. The other characters have derivatives whose magnitudes are positive integral multiples of 2. As a result, the constant is the unique number such that the group T, equipped with its Haar measure, is Pontrjagin dual to the lattice of integral multiples of 2. This is a version of the one-dimensional Poisson summation formula.

=== Modular forms and theta functions ===
The constant is connected in a deep way with the theory of modular forms and theta functions. For example, the Chudnovsky algorithm involves in an essential way the j-invariant of an elliptic curve.

Modular forms are holomorphic functions in the upper half plane characterized by their transformation properties under the modular group formula_100 (or its various subgroups), a lattice in the group formula_101. An example is the Jacobi theta function
formula_102
which is a kind of modular form called a Jacobi form. This is sometimes written in terms of the nome formula_103.

The constant is the unique constant making the Jacobi theta function an automorphic form, which means that it transforms in a specific way. Certain identities hold for all automorphic forms. An example is
formula_104
which implies that transforms as a representation under the discrete Heisenberg group. General modular forms and other theta functions also involve , once again because of the Stone–von Neumann theorem.

=== Cauchy distribution and potential theory ===
The Cauchy distribution
formula_105
is a probability density function. The total probability is equal to one, owing to the integral:
formula_106

The Shannon entropy of the Cauchy distribution is equal to , which also involves .

The Cauchy distribution plays an important role in potential theory because it is the simplest Furstenberg measure, the classical Poisson kernel associated with a Brownian motion in a half-plane. Conjugate harmonic functions and so also the Hilbert transform are associated with the asymptotics of the Poisson kernel. The Hilbert transform &quot;H&quot; is the integral transform given by the Cauchy principal value of the singular integral
formula_107

The constant is the unique (positive) normalizing factor such that &quot;H&quot; defines a linear complex structure on the Hilbert space of square-integrable real-valued functions on the real line. The Hilbert transform, like the Fourier transform, can be characterized purely in terms of its transformation properties on the Hilbert space : up to a normalization factor, it is the unique bounded linear operator that commutes with positive dilations and anti-commutes with all reflections of the real line. The constant is the unique normalizing factor that makes this transformation unitary.

=== In the Mandelbrot set===
An occurrence of in the fractal called the Mandelbrot set was discovered by David Boll in 1991. He examined the behaviour of the Mandelbrot set near the &quot;neck&quot; at . When the number of iterations until divergence for the point is multiplied by , the result approaches as approaches zero. The point at the cusp of the large &quot;valley&quot; on the right side of the Mandelbrot set behaves similarly: the number of iterations until divergence multiplied by the square root of tends to .

=== Projective geometry ===
Let be the set of all twice differentiable real functions formula_108 that satisfy the ordinary differential equation formula_109. Then is a two-dimensional real vector space, with two parameters corresponding to a pair of initial conditions for the differential equation. For any formula_110, let formula_111 be the evaluation functional, which associates to each formula_112 the value formula_113 of the function at the real point . Then, for each &quot;t&quot;, the kernel of formula_114 is a one-dimensional linear subspace of . Hence formula_115 defines a function from formula_116 from the real line to the real projective line. This function is periodic, and the quantity can be characterized as the period of this map. This is notable in that the constant , rather than 2, appears naturally in this context.

== Outside mathematics ==

=== Describing physical phenomena ===
Although not a physical constant, appears routinely in equations describing fundamental principles of the universe, often because of &#x27;s relationship to the circle and to spherical coordinate systems. A simple formula from the field of classical mechanics gives the approximate period of a simple pendulum of length , swinging with a small amplitude ( is the earth&#x27;s gravitational acceleration):
formula_117

One of the key formulae of quantum mechanics is Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle, which shows that the uncertainty in the measurement of a particle&#x27;s position (Δ) and momentum (Δ) cannot both be arbitrarily small at the same time (where is the Planck constant):
formula_118

The fact that is approximately equal to 3 plays a role in the relatively long lifetime of orthopositronium. The inverse lifetime to lowest order in the fine-structure constant is
formula_119
where is the mass of the electron.

 is present in some structural engineering formulae, such as the buckling formula derived by Euler, which gives the maximum axial load that a long, slender column of length , modulus of elasticity , and area moment of inertia can carry without buckling:
formula_120

The field of fluid dynamics contains in Stokes&#x27; law, which approximates the frictional force exerted on small, spherical objects of radius , moving with velocity in a fluid with dynamic viscosity :
formula_121

In electromagnetics, the vacuum permeability constant &quot;μ&quot;0 appears in Maxwell&#x27;s equations, which describe the properties of electric and magnetic fields and electromagnetic radiation. Before 20 May 2019, it was defined as exactly
formula_122

=== Memorizing digits ===

Piphilology is the practice of memorizing large numbers of digits of , and world-records are kept by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. The record for memorizing digits of , certified by Guinness World Records, is 70,000 digits, recited in India by Rajveer Meena in 9 hours and 27 minutes on 21 March 2015. In 2006, Akira Haraguchi, a retired Japanese engineer, claimed to have recited 100,000 decimal places, but the claim was not verified by Guinness World Records.

One common technique is to memorize a story or poem in which the word lengths represent the digits of : The first word has three letters, the second word has one, the third has four, the fourth has one, the fifth has five, and so on. Such memorization aids are called mnemonics. An early example of a mnemonic for pi, originally devised by English scientist James Jeans, is &quot;How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics.&quot; When a poem is used, it is sometimes referred to as a &quot;piem&quot;. Poems for memorizing have been composed in several languages in addition to English. Record-setting memorizers typically do not rely on poems, but instead use methods such as remembering number patterns and the method of loci.

A few authors have used the digits of to establish a new form of constrained writing, where the word lengths are required to represent the digits of . The &quot;Cadaeic Cadenza&quot; contains the first 3835 digits of in this manner, and the full-length book &quot;Not a Wake&quot; contains 10,000 words, each representing one digit of .

=== In popular culture ===
Perhaps because of the simplicity of its definition and its ubiquitous presence in formulae, has been represented in popular culture more than other mathematical constructs.

In the Palais de la Découverte (a science museum in Paris) there is a circular room known as the &quot;pi room&quot;. On its wall are inscribed 707 digits of . The digits are large wooden characters attached to the dome-like ceiling. The digits were based on an 1873 calculation by English mathematician William Shanks, which included an error beginning at the 528th digit. The error was detected in 1946 and corrected in 1949.

In Carl Sagan&#x27;s 1985 novel &quot;Contact&quot; it is suggested that the creator of the universe buried a message deep within the digits of . This part of the story was omitted from the film adaptation of the novel. The digits of have also been incorporated into the lyrics of the song &quot;Pi&quot; from the 2005 album &quot;Aerial&quot; by Kate Bush. In the 1967 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Wolf in the Fold&quot;, an out-of-control computer is contained by being instructed to &quot;Compute to the last digit the value of &quot;.

In the United States, Pi Day falls on 14 March (written 3/14 in the US style), and is popular among students. and its digital representation are often used by self-described &quot;math geeks&quot; for inside jokes among mathematically and technologically minded groups. A college cheer variously attributed to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute includes &quot;3.14159&quot;. Pi Day in 2015 was particularly significant because the date and time 3/14/15 9:26:53 reflected many more digits of pi. In parts of the world where dates are commonly noted in day/month/year format, 22 July represents &quot;Pi Approximation Day&quot;, as 22/7 = 3.142857.
Some have proposed replacing by , arguing that , as the number of radians in one turn or the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its radius, is more natural than and simplifies many formulae. This use of has not made its way into mainstream mathematics, but since 2010 this has led to people celebrating Two Pi Day or Tau Day on June 28.

In 1897, an amateur mathematician attempted to persuade the Indiana legislature to pass the Indiana Pi Bill, which described a method to square the circle and contained text that implied various incorrect values for , including 3.2. The bill is notorious as an attempt to establish a value of mathematical constant by legislative fiat. The bill was passed by the Indiana House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate, and thus it did not become a law.

In contemporary internet culture, individuals and organizations frequently pay homage to the number . For instance, the computer scientist Donald Knuth let the version numbers of his program TeX approach . The versions are 3, 3.1, 3.14, and so forth.

<text>Postmodernism is a term used to refer to a variety of artistic, cultural, and philosophical movements that claim to mark a break from modernism. They have in common the conviction that it is no longer possible to rely upon previous ways of depicting the world. Still, there is disagreement among experts about its more precise meaning even within narrow contexts.

The term began to acquire its current range of meanings in literary criticism and architectural theory during the 1950s–1960s. In opposition to modernism&#x27;s alleged self-seriousness, postmodernism is characterized by its playful use of eclectic styles and performative irony, among other features. Critics claim it supplants moral, political, and aesthetic ideals with mere style and spectacle.

In the 1990s, &quot;postmodernism&quot; came to denote a general – and, in general, celebratory – response to cultural pluralism. Proponents align themselves with feminism, multiculturalism, and postcolonialism. Building upon poststructural theory, postmodern thought defined itself by the rejection of any single, foundational historical narrative. This called into question the legitimacy of the Enlightenment account of progress and rationality. Critics allege that its premises lead to a nihilistic form of relativism. In this sense, it has become a term of abuse in popular culture.

== Definitions ==
&quot;Postmodernism&quot; is &quot;a highly contested term&quot;, referring to &quot;a particularly unstable concept&quot;, that &quot;names many different kinds of cultural objects and phenomena in many different ways&quot;. It may be described simply as a general mood or &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;.

Although postmodernisms are generally united in their effort to transcend the perceived limits of modernism, &quot;modernism&quot; also means different things to different critics in various arts. Further, there are outliers on even this basic stance; for instance, literary critic William Spanos conceives postmodernism not in period terms but in terms of a certain kind of literary imagination so that pre-modern texts such as Euripides&#x27; &quot;Orestes&quot; or Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot; count as postmodern.

According to scholar Louis Menand, &quot;Postmodernism is the Swiss Army knife of critical concepts. It&#x27;s definitionally overloaded, and it can do almost any job you need done.&quot; From an opposing perspective, media theorist Dick Hebdige criticized the vagueness of the term, enumerating a long list of otherwise unrelated concepts that people have designated as postmodernism, from &quot;the décor of a room&quot; or &quot;a &#x27;scratch&#x27; video&quot;, to fear of nuclear armageddon and the &quot;implosion of meaning&quot;, and stated that anything that could signify all of those things was &quot;a buzzword&quot;.

All this notwithstanding, scholar Hans Bertens offers the following:

If there is a common denominator to all these postmodernisms, it is that of a crisis in representation: a deeply felt loss of faith in our ability to represent the real, in the widest sense. No matter whether they are aesthestic [sic], epistemological, moral, or political in nature, the representations that we used to rely on can no longer be taken for granted.
In practical terms, postmodernisms share an attitude of skepticism towards grand explanations and established ways of doing things. In art, literature, and architecture, this attitude blurs boundaries between styles and genres, and encourages freely mixing elements, challenging traditional distinctions like high art versus popular art. In science, it emphasizes multiple ways of seeing things, and how our cultural and personal backgrounds shape how we see the world, making it impossible to be completely objective. In philosophy, education, history, politics, and many other fields, it encourages critical re-examination of established institutions and social norms, embracing diversity, and breaking down disciplinary boundaries. Though these ideas weren&#x27;t strictly new, postmodernism amplified them, using an often playful, at times deeply critical, attitude of pervasive skepticism to turn them into defining features.

== Historical overview ==
Two broad cultural movements, modernism and postmodernism, emerged in response to profound changes in the Western world. The Industrial Revolution, urbanization, secularization, technological advances, two world wars, and globalization deeply disrupted the social order. Modernism emerged in the late 1800s, seeking to redefine fundamental truths and values through a radical rethinking of traditional ideas and forms across many fields. Postmodernism emerged in the mid-20th century with a skeptical perspective that questioned the notion of universal truths and reshaped modernist approaches by embracing the complexity and contradictions of modern life.

The term &quot;postmodernism&quot; first appeared in print in 1870, but it only began to enter circulation with its current range of meanings in the 1950s—60s.

=== Early appearances ===

The term &quot;postmodern&quot; was first used in 1870 by the artist John Watkins Chapman, who described &quot;a Postmodern style of painting&quot; as a departure from French Impressionism. Similarly, the first citation given by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is dated to 1916, describing Gus Mager as &quot;one of the few &#x27;post&#x27; modern painters whose style is convincing&quot;.

Episcopal priest and cultural commentator J. M. Thompson, in a 1914 article, uses the term to describe changes in attitudes and beliefs in the critique of religion, writing, &quot;the &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; of Post-Modernism is to escape from the double-mindedness of modernism by being thorough in its criticism by extending it to religion as well as theology, to Catholic feeling as well as to Catholic tradition&quot;. In 1926, Bernard Iddings Bell, president of St. Stephen&#x27;s College and also an Episcopal priest, published &quot;Postmodernism and Other Essays&quot;, which marks the first use of the term to describe an historical period following modernity. The essay criticizes lingering socio-cultural norms, attitudes, and practices of the Enlightenment. It is also critical of a purported cultural shift away from traditional Christian beliefs.

The term &quot;postmodernity&quot; was first used in an academic historical context as a general concept for a movement by Arnold J. Toynbee in a 1939 essay, which states that &quot;Our own Post-Modern Age has been inaugurated by the general war of 1914–1918&quot;.

In 1942, the literary critic and author H. R. Hays describes postmodernism as a new literary form. Also in the arts, the term was first used in 1949 to describe a dissatisfaction with the modernist architectural movement known as the International Style.

Although these early uses anticipate some of the concerns of the debate in the second part of the 20th century, there is little direct continuity in the discussion. Just when the new discussion begins, however, is also a matter of dispute. Various authors place its beginnings in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

===Theoretical development===
In the mid-1970s, the American sociologist Daniel Bell provided a general account of the postmodern as an effectively nihilistic response to modernism&#x27;s alleged assault on the Protestant work ethic and its rejection of what he upheld as traditional values. The ideals of modernity, per his diagnosis, were degraded to the level of consumer choice. This research project, however, was not taken up in a significant way by others until the mid-1980s when the work of Jean Baudrillard and Fredric Jameson, building upon art and literary criticism, reintroduced the term to sociology.

Discussion about the postmodern in the second part of the 20th century was most articulate in areas with a large body of critical discourse around the modernist movement. Even here, however, there continued to be disagreement about such basic issues as whether postmodernism is a break with modernism, a renewal and intensification of modernism, or even, both at once, a rejection and a radicalization of its historical predecessor.

While discussions in the 1970s were dominated by literary criticism, these were supplanted by architectural theory in the 1980s. Some of these conversations made use of French poststructuralist thought, but only after these innovations and critical discourse in the arts did postmodernism emerge as a philosophical term in its own right.

====In literary and architectural theory====

According to Hans Bertens and Perry Anderson, the Black Mountain poets Charles Olson and Robert Creeley first introduced the term &quot;postmodern&quot; in its current sense during the 1950s.
Their stance against modernist poetry – and Olson&#x27;s Heideggerian orientation – were influential in the identification of postmodernism as a polemical position opposed to the rationalist values championed by the Enlightenment project.

During the 1960s, this affirmative use gave way to a pejorative use by the New Left, who used it to describe a waning commitment among youth to the political ideals socialism and communism. The literary critic Irving Howe, for instance, denounced postmodern literature for being content to merely reflect, rather than actively attempt to refashion, what he saw as the &quot;increasingly shapeless&quot; character of contemporary society.

In the 1970s, this changed again, largely under the influence of the literary critic Ihab Hassan&#x27;s large-scale survey of works that he said could no longer be called modern. Taking the Black Mountain poets an exemplary instance of the new postmodern type, Hassan celebrates its Nietzschean playfulness and cheerfully anarchic spirit, which he sets off against the high seriousness of modernism.

(Yet, from another perspective, Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s attack on Western philosophy and Martin Heidegger&#x27;s critique of metaphysics posed deep theoretical problems not necessarily a cause for aesthetic celebration. Their further influence on the conversation about postmodernism, however, would be largely mediated by French poststructuralism.)

If literature were at the center of the discussion in the 1970s, architecture was at the center in the 1980s. The architectural theorist Charles Jencks, in particular, connected the artistic avant-garde to social change in a way that captured attention outside of academia. Jenckes, much influenced by the American architect Robert Venturi, celebrated a plurality of forms and encourages participation and active engagement with the local context of the built environment. He presented this as in opposition to the &quot;authoritarian style&quot; of International Modernism.

====The influence of poststructuralism====
In the 1970s, postmodern criticism increasingly came to incorporate poststructuralist theory, particularly the deconstructive approach to texts most strongly associated with Jacques Derrida, who attempted to demonstrate that the whole foundationalist approach to language and knowledge was untenable and misguided. It is during this period that postmodernism came to be particularly equated with a kind of anti-representational self-reflexivity.

In the 1980s, some critics began to take an interest in the work of Michel Foucault. This introduced a political concern about social power-relations into discussions about postmodernism. This was also the beginning of the affiliation of postmodernism with feminism and multiculturalism. The art critic Craig Owens, in particular, not only made the connection to feminism explicit, but went so far as to claim feminism for postmodernism wholesale, a broad claim resisted by even many sympathetic feminists such as Nancy Fraser and Linda Nicholson.

====Generalization====
Although postmodern criticism and thought drew on philosophical ideas from early on, &quot;postmodernism&quot; was only introduced to the expressly philosophical lexicon by Jean-François Lyotard in his 1979 &quot;The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge&quot;. This work served as a catalyst for many of the subsequent intellectual debates around the term.

By the 1990s, postmodernism had become increasingly identified with critical and philosophical discourse directly about postmodernity or the postmodern idiom itself. No longer centered on any particular art or even the arts in general, it instead turned to address the more general problems posed to society in general by a new proliferation of cultures and forms. It is during this period that it also came to be associated with postcolonialism and identity politics.

Around this time, postmodernism also began to be conceived in popular culture as a general &quot;philosophical disposition&quot; associated with a loose sort of relativism. In this sense, the term also started to appear as a &quot;casual term of abuse&quot; in non-academic contexts. Others identified it as an aesthetic &quot;lifestyle&quot; of eclecticism and playful self-irony.

===The &quot;Science Wars&quot;===
The basis for what became known later as the Science Wars was the 1962 publication of &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; by the physicist and historian of science Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn presented the direction of scientific inquiry — the kind of questions that can be asked, and what counts as a correct answer — as governed by a &quot;paradigm&quot; defining what counts as &quot;normal science&quot; during any given period. While not based on postmodern ideas or Continental philosophy, Kuhn&#x27;s intervention set the agenda for much of &quot;The Postmodern Condition&quot; and has subsequently been presented as the beginning of &quot;postmodern epistemology&quot; in the philosophy of science.

In Kuhn&#x27;s 1962 framework, the assumptions introduced by new paradigms make them &quot;mutually incommensurable&quot; with previous ones, although they may provide improved explanations of the material world. A more radical version of incommensurablity, introduced by the philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend, made stronger claims that connected the largely Anglo-American debate about science to the development of poststructuralism in France.

To some, the stakes were more than epistemological. The philosopher Israel Scheffler, for instance, argued that the ever-expanding body of scientific knowledge embodies a sort of &quot;moral principle&quot; protecting society from its authoritarian and tribal tendencies. In this way, with the addition of the poststructuralist influence, the debate about science expanded into a debate about Western culture in general. 

The French political philosophers Alain Renaut and Luc Ferry began a series of responses to this interpretation of postmodernism, and these inspired the physicist Alan Sokal to submit a deliberately nonsensical paper to a postmodernist journal, where it was accepted and published in 1996. Although the so-called Sokal hoax proved nothing about postmodernism or science, it added to the public perception of a high-stakes intellectual &quot;war&quot; that had already been introduced to the general public by popular books published in the late &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s. By the late &#x27;90s, however, the debate had largely subsided, in part due to the recognition that it had been staged between strawman versions of postmodernism and science alike.

Postmodernism encompasses a wide range of artistic movements and styles. In visual arts, pop art, conceptual art, feminist art, video art, minimalism, and neo-expressionism are among the approaches recognized as postmodern. The label extends to diverse musical genres and artists: John Cage, Madonna, and punk rock all meet postmodern definitions. Literature, film, architecture, theater, fashion, dance, and many other creative disciplines saw postmodern expression. As an example, Andy Warhol&#x27;s pop art across multiple mediums challenged traditional distinctions between high and low culture, and blurred the lines between fine art and commercial design. His work, exemplified by the iconic &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Soup Cans&quot; series during the 1960s, brought the postmodernist sensibility to mainstream attention.

Criticism of postmodernist movements in the arts include objections to departure from beauty, the reliance on language for the art to have meaning, a lack of coherence or comprehensibility, deviation from clear structure, and consistent use of dark and negative themes.

=== Architecture ===


Scholarship regarding postmodernism and architecture is closely linked with the writings of critic-turned-architect Charles Jencks, beginning with lectures in the early 1970s and his essay &quot;The Rise of Post-Modern Architecture&quot; from 1975. His &quot;magnum opus&quot;, however, is the book &quot;The Language of Post-Modern Architecture&quot;, first published in 1977, and since running to seven editions (in which he famously wrote: &quot;Modern architecture died in St. Louis, Missouri, on 15 July 1972 at 3:32 p.m. (or thereabouts) when the infamous Pruitt–Igoe scheme, or rather several of its slab blocks, were given the final coup de grâce by dynamite.&quot;).

Jencks makes the point that postmodernism (like modernism) varies for each field of art, and that for architecture it is not just a reaction to modernism but what he terms &quot;double coding&quot;: &quot;Double Coding: the combination of Modern techniques with something else (usually traditional building) in order for architecture to communicate with the public and a concerned minority, usually other architects.&quot;

In their book, &quot;Revisiting Postmodernism&quot;, Terry Farrell and Adam Furman argue that postmodernism brought a more joyous and sensual experience to the culture, particularly in architecture. For instance, in response to the modernist slogan of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe that &quot;less is more&quot;, the postmodernist Robert Venturi rejoined that &quot;less is a bore&quot;.

===Dance===

The term &quot;postmodern dance&quot; is most strongly associated with the Judson Dance Theater, located in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village during the 1960s and 1970s. Perhaps its most important principle is taken from the composer John Cage&#x27;s efforts to break down the distinction between art and life, developed in particular by the American dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham, Cage&#x27;s partner. The Judson dancers &quot;[stripped] dance of its theatrical conventions such as virtuoso technique, fanciful costumes, complex storylines, and the traditional stage [and] drew on everyday movements (sitting, walking, kneeling, and other gestures) to create their pieces, often performing them in ordinary spaces.&quot; Anna Halprin&#x27;s San Francisco Dancers&#x27; Workshop, established in the 1950s to explore beyond the technical constraints of modern dance, pioneered ideas later developed at Judson; Halprin, Simone Forti, and Yvonne Rainer are considered &quot;giants of the field&quot;.

The Judson collective included trained dancers, visual artists, filmmakers, writers, and composers, exchanging approaches, and critiquing traditional dance, with a focus &quot;more on the intellectual process of creating dance than the end result&quot;. The end of the 1970s saw a distancing from this analytical postmodern dance, and a return to the expression of meaning. In the 1980s and 1990s, dance began to incorporate other typically postmodern features such as the mixing of genres, challenging high–low cultural distinctions, and incorporating a political dimension.

=== Film ===

Postmodern film aims to subvert the mainstream conventions of narrative structure and characterization, and to test the audience&#x27;s suspension of disbelief. Typically, such films also break down the cultural divide between high and low art and often upend typical portrayals of gender, race, class, genre, and time with the goal of creating something that does not abide by traditional narrative expression.

Certain key characteristics are used to separate the postmodern from modernist cinema and traditional narrative film. One is an extensive use of homage or pastiche, imitating the style or character of other artistic works. A second is meta-reference or self-reference, highlighting the relation of the image to other images in media and not to any kind of external reality. Viewers are reminded that the film itself is only a film, perhaps through the use of intertextuality, in which the film&#x27;s characters reference other works of fiction. A third characteristic is stories that unfold out of chronological order, deconstructing or fragmenting time to emphasize the constructed nature of film. Another common element is a bridging of the gap between highbrow and lowbrow. Contradictions of all sorts are crucial to postmodernism.

Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) has been widely studied as a prime example of postmodernism. The setting is a future dystopia where &quot;replicants&quot;, enhanced android workers nearly indistinguishable from humans, are hunted down when they escape from their jobs. The film blurs boundaries between genres and cultures, and fuses disparate styles and periods: futuristic visuals &quot;mingle with drab 1940s clothes and offices, punk rock hairstyles, pop Egyptian styles and oriental culture.&quot; The blending of film noir and science-fiction into tech noir illustrates the deconstruction of both cinema and genre. The film can also be seen as an example of major studios using the &quot;mystique and cachet of the term &#x27;postmodern&#x27; as a sales pitch&quot;, resulting in Hollywood movies that &quot;demonstrate all the postmodern characteristics&quot;. From another perspective, &quot;critical responses to &quot;Blade Runner&quot; fall on either side of a modern/postmodern line&quot; – critical analysis from &quot;modernist&quot; and &quot;postmodernist&quot; approaches produce entirely different interpretations.

=== Literature ===

In 1971, the American literary theorist Ihab Hassan made &quot;postmodernism&quot; popular in literary studies with his influential book, &quot;The Dismemberment of Orpheus: Toward a Postmodern Literature&quot;. According to scholar David Herwitz, American writers such as John Barth (who had controversially declared that the novel was &quot;exhausted&quot; as a genre), Donald Barthelme, and Thomas Pynchon responded in various ways to the stylistic innovations of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; and the late work of Samuel Beckett. Postmodern literature often calls attention to issues regarding its own complicated connection to reality. The postmodern novel plays with language, twisted plots, multiple narrators, and unresolved endings, unsettling the conventional idea of the novel as faithfully reflecting the world.

In &quot;Postmodernist Fiction&quot; (1987), Brian McHale details the shift from modernism to postmodernism, arguing that postmodern works developed out of modernism, moving from concern with what is there (&quot;ontological dominant&quot;) to concern with how we can know it&#x27;s there (&quot;epistemological dominant&quot;). McHale&#x27;s &quot;What Was Postmodernism?&quot; (2007) follows Raymond Federman&#x27;s lead in now using the past tense when discussing postmodernism. Others argue that postmodernism in literature utilizes compositional and semantic practices such as inclusivity, intentional indiscrimination, nonselection, and &quot;logical impossibility.&quot;

=== Music ===

Postmodern influence extends across all areas of music; its accessibility to a general audience requires an understanding of references, irony, and pastiche that varies widely between artists and their works. In popular music, Madonna, David Bowie, and Talking Heads have been singled out by critics and scholars as postmodern icons. The belief that art music – serious, classical music – holds higher cultural and technical value than folk and popular traditions, lost influence under postmodern analysis, as musical hybrids and crossovers attracted scholarly attention.

Across musical traditions, postmodernism can be identified through several core characteristics: genre mixing; irony, humor, and self-parody; &quot;surface&quot; exploration with less concern for formal structure than in modernist approaches; and a return to tonality. This represents a loss of authority of the Eurocentric perspective on music and the rise of world music as influenced by postmodern values. Composers took different routes: some returned to traditional modes over experimentation, others challenged the authority of dominant musical structures, others intermingled disparate sources.

The composer Jonathan Kramer has written that avant-garde musical compositions (which some would consider modernist rather than postmodernist) &quot;defy more than seduce the listener, and they extend by potentially unsettling means the very idea of what music is.&quot; In the 1960s, composers such as Henryk Górecki and Philip Glass reacted to the perceived elitism and dissonant sound of atonal academic modernism by producing music with simple textures and relatively consonant harmonies, whilst others, most notably John Cage challenged the modernist account of structure by including the contingent in the structure of his compositions themselves.

In 2023, music critic Andy Cush described Talking Heads as &quot;New York art-punks&quot; whose &quot;blend of nervy postmodernism and undeniable groove made them one of the defining rock bands of the late 1970s and &#x27;80s.&quot; Media theorist Dick Hebdige, examining the &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot; music video in 1989, said the group &quot;draw eclectically on a wide range of visual and aural sources to create a distinctive pastiche or hybrid &#x27;house style&#x27; which they have used since their formation in the mid-1970s deliberately to stretch received (industrial) definitions of what rock/pop/video/Art/ performance/audience are&quot;, calling them &quot;a properly postmodernist band.&quot; According to lead vocalist/guitarist/songwriter David Byrne, commenting in 2011, &quot;Anything could be mixed and matched – or mashed up, as is said today – and anything was fair game for inspiration.”

Avant-garde academics labelled American singer Madonna a &quot;personification of the postmodern&quot; and created a sub-discipline of cultural studies known as Madonna studies. Her self-aware constructs of gender and identity, and classic film references in music videos for &quot;Material Girl&quot; (1984) and &quot;Express Yourself&quot; (1989), made her a favorite of cultural theorists, who saw her as &quot;enacting postmodernist models of subjectivity.&quot; Madonna was seen to embody fragmentation, pastiche, retrospection, anti-foundationalism, and de-differentiation; her &quot;subversion of the subversion of the subversion of the male gaze&quot; in the &quot;Material Girl&quot; video was analyzed.

=== Performance and theater ===

Postmodern theater emerged as a reaction against modernist theater. Most postmodern productions are centered on highlighting the fallibility of definite truth, instead encouraging the audience to reach their own individual understanding. Essentially, thus, postmodern theater raises questions rather than attempting to supply answers.

=== Sculpture ===

Sculptor Claes Oldenberg, at the forefront of the pop art movement, declared in 1961: &quot;I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical … I am for an art that embroils itself with everyday crap and still comes out on top.&quot; That year, he opened &quot;The Store&quot; in a dime store area of New York&#x27;s Lower East Side, where he blurred the line between art and commerce by producing and selling brightly painted plaster replicas of hamburgers and cans of soda, dresses, underwear, and other everyday objects: &quot;Museum in b[ourgeois] concept equals store in mine&quot;.

== In philosophy ==

=== Poststructuralist precursors ===

In the 1970s, a disparate group of French theorists – often grouped together as &quot;poststructuralists&quot; – developed a critique of modern philosophy with roots discernible in Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger&#x27;s critique of metaphysics. Although few themselves relied upon the term, they became known to many as postmodern theorists. Poststructuralism is sometimes treated as distinct from or a subcategory of postmodernism and sometimes is treated as having been subsumed by postmodernism. While their ideas exerted a great influence on debates about the postmodern, the French poststucturalists themselves did not intervene or attempt to provide their own definitions of the postmodern.

Poststructuralists, like structuralists, start from the assumption that people&#x27;s identities, values, and economic conditions determine each other as parts of a common whole, rather than having intrinsic properties that can be understood in isolation. While structuralism explores how meaning is produced by a set of essential relationships in an overarching quasi-linguistic system, poststructuralism accepts this premise, but rejects the assumption that such systems can ever be fixed or centered. Instead, poststructuralists stress the various ways that cultural structures are produced in history. They also emphasize how meaning is generated, rather than discovered, and they replace the traditional concept of &quot;representation&quot; (according to which meaning is determined by the objected signified) to focus instead upon the elastic potentialities of language to generate new meanings.

Politically, all of them began with Marxist sympathies, became disillusioned, and eventually opposed the French Communist Party and its application of theory. The chaos following the briefly successful communist revolution of May &#x27;68 in France was a particular point of rupture.

==== Jacques Derrida and deconstruction ====
Deconstruction is a practice in philosophy, literary criticism, and close reading developed by Jacques Derrida. It is based on the assumption, which it seeks to validate by textual analysis, that any text harbors inherent points of &quot;undecidability&quot; that undermine any stable meaning intended by the author. The process of writing inevitably, he aims to show, reveals suppressed elements, challenging the oppositions that are thought to sustain the text. Nevertheless, Derrida does not wish to do away with such concepts as &quot;origin&quot; or &quot;truth&quot;. What he challenges is any claim to finality. Such metaphysical concepts are, as he puts it, &quot;under erasure&quot;, and this, he says, makes deconstructive reading a kind of &quot;double play&quot;.

From this perspective, Derrida argues that the practice of metaphysics in the Western tradition depends upon hierarchies and orders of subordination within various dualisms that it does not acknowledge. It prioritizes presence and purity over the contingent and complicated, dismissing them as aberrations irrelevant to philosophical analysis. In essence, according to Derrida, metaphysical thought prioritizes one side of an opposition while ignoring or marginalizing the alternative. He uses the term metaphysics of presence to describe the foundationalist approach to knowledge, taking himself to have demonstrated that we do not have unmediated access to reality. This project of deconstructing and challenging the assumptions of modern philosophy was influential for many postmodern thinkers.

====Michel Foucault on power relations====
French philosopher and social theorist Michel Foucault argued that power operates according to the logics of social institutions that have become unmoored from the intentions of any actual individuals. Individuals, according to Foucault, are both products and participants in these dynamics. Among other strategies, he employed a Nietzsche-inspired &quot;genealogical method&quot; to analyze power-relations across their historical permutations.

Both Foucault&#x27;s political orientation and the consistency of his positions continue to be debated among critics and defenders alike. Nevertheless, Foucault&#x27;s political works share two common elements: a historical perspective and a discursive methodology. He analyzed social phenomena in historical contexts and focused on how they have evolved over time. Additionally, he employed the study of written texts, usually academic texts, as the material for his inquiries. In this way, Foucault sought to understand how the historical formation of discourses has shaped contemporary political thinking and institutions.

====Jean Baudrillard on hyperreality====
Although trained in sociology, Jean Baudrillard worked across many disciplines. Drawing upon some of the technical vocabulary of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Baudrillard argued that social production had shifted from creating real objects to instead producing signs and symbols. This system of symbolic exchange, detached from the real, constitutes hyperreality. In the words of one commentator, &quot;the hyperreal is a system of simulation that simulates itself.&quot;

Postmodernity, Baudrillard said, is the condition in which the domain of reality has become so heavily mediated by signs as to become inaccessible in itself, leaving us entirely in the domain of the simulacra, images that bear no relation to anything outside of themselves. This hyperreality is presented as the terminal stage of simulation, where signs and images become entirely self-referential.

Baudrillard&#x27;s vision of postmodernity has been described as &quot;apocalyptic&quot;, and scholars disagree about whether his later works are intended as science fiction or truthful theoretical claims. Another interpretation is that Baudrillard deliberately adopts the role of &quot;agent provocateur&quot;.

===A crisis of legitimacy===
At the center of the intellectual debate about postmodernism is the question of what, if anything, grounds theory. What establishes that a statement is true or that an action is right? This foundational debate is most prominently on display in Habermas&#x27;s rejoinder to Lyotard&#x27;s anti-foundational, postmodern challenge to Habermas&#x27;s own foundational version of modernism.

==== &quot;The Postmodern Condition&quot; ====

Jean-François Lyotard is credited with being the first to use the term &quot;postmodern&quot; in a philosophical context. This appeared in his 1979 &quot;&quot;. In this influential work, Lyotard provided the following definition: &quot;Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives&quot;.

By &quot;metanarratives&quot;, Lyotard meant such overarching narrative frameworks as those provided by Christianity, G. W. F. Hegel, and Karl Marx that unite and determine our basic sense of our place and significance in the world. It was his early disillusionment with his early Marxism that would later be generalized into the universal claim about metanarratives. In a society with no unifying narrative, he argued, we are left with heterogeneous, group-specific narratives (or &quot;language games&quot;, as adopted from Ludwig Wittgenstein) with no universal perspective from which to adjudicate among them.

According to Lyotard, this introduced a general crisis of legitimacy, a theme he adopts from the philosopher Jürgen Habermas, whose theory of communicative rationality Lyotard rejected. While he was particularly concerned in that report with the way that this insight undermined claims of scientific objectivity, Lyotard&#x27;s argument undermines the entire principle of transcendent legitimization. Instead, proponents of a language game must make the case for their legitimacy with reference to such considerations as efficiency or practicality. Far from celebrating the apparently relativistic consequences of this argument, however, Lyotard focused much of his subsequent work on how links among games could be established, particularly with respect to ethics and politics.

====The philosophical criticism of Jürgen Habermas====
The philosopher Jürgen Habermas, a prominent critic of philosophical postmodernism, argued in his 1985 work &quot;The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity&quot; that postmodern thinkers were caught in a performative contradiction, more specifically, that their critiques of modernity rely on concepts and methods that are themselves products of modern reason.

Habermas criticized these thinkers for their rejection of the subject and their embrace of experimental, avant-garde strategies. He asserted that their critiques of modernism ultimately lead to a longing for the very subject they seek to dismantle. Habermas also took issue with postmodernists&#x27; leveling of the distinction between philosophy and literature. He argued that such rhetorical strategies undermine the importance of argument and communicative reason.

Habermas&#x27;s critique of postmodernism set the stage for much of the subsequent debate by clarifying some of its key underlying issues. According to scholar Gary Aylesworth – against those who would dismiss postmodernist discourse as simple nonsense – the fact that Habermas was &quot;able to read postmodernist texts closely and discursively testifies to their intelligibility&quot;. His engagement with their ideas has led some postmodern philosophers, following Lyotard, to similarly engage with Habermas&#x27;s criticisms.

===Frederic Jameson&#x27;s Marxist rejoinder===
The appearance of linguistic relativism also inspired an extensive rebuttal by the Marxist critic Fredric Jameson. Building upon the theoretical foundations laid out by the Marxist economist Ernst Mandel and observations in the early work of the sociologist Jean Baudrillard, Jameson developed his own conception of the postmodern as &quot;the cultural logic of late capitalism&quot; in the form of an enormous cultural expansion into an economy of spectacle and style, rather than the production of goods. According to Jameson, because the postmodernism is result of political and historical circumstances that make up the social world, it is not something that can be simply embraced or condemned. Instead, it must be analyzed and understood so that we may confront the world as it is.

Jameson categorizes a variety of features of the postmodern. One is the elision of the distinction between high culture and mass culture. Also, because of our loss of a unified &quot;bourgeois ego&quot;, subjectivity is less focused, and we experience what he terms a &quot;waning of the affect&quot;, an emotional disengagement from the social world. This loss of significance leads to what he calls &quot;depthlessness&quot;, a difficulty in getting beneath the surfaces of cultural objects to find any deeper significance than is offered directly to the subject. Reduced to a set of styles, history looses its political force. This phenomenon finds expression, for instance, in the shift from &quot;parody&quot;, in which styles are mixed in the interest of making a point, to &quot;pastiche&quot;, in which styles are mixed together without attention to their original contexts.

===Richard Rorty&#x27;s neopragmatism===
Richard Rorty was an American philosopher known for his linguistic form of neopragmatism. Initially attracted to analytic philosophy, Rorty later rejected its representationalism. His major influences, rather than the poststructuralists, include Charles Darwin, Hans Georg Gadamer, G. W. F. Hegel, and Martin Heidegger.

Rorty challenged the notion of a mind-independent, language-independent reality. He argued that language is a tool used to adapt to the environment and achieve desired ends. This naturalistic approach led him to abandon the traditional quest for a privileged mental power that allows direct access to things-in-themselves.

Instead, Rorty advocated for a focus on imaginative alternatives to present beliefs rather than the pursuit of independently grounded truths. He believed that creative, secular humanism, free from authoritarian assertions about truth and goodness, is the key to a better future. Rorty saw his neopragmatism as a continuation of the Enlightenment project, aiming to demystify human life and replace traditional power relations with those based on tolerance and freedom.

==In other fields==
Postmodernism is more fully understood by observing its effects in such diverse fields as law, education, urban planning, religious studies, politics and many others. Its influence varies widely across disciplines, reflecting the extent to which postmodern theories and ideas have been integrated into actual practices.

=== Anthropology ===

Postmodern theory in anthropology originated in the 1960s, alongside the literary postmodern movement. Reflexivity is central to postmodern anthropology, a continuous practice of critical self-awareness that attempts to address the subjectivity inherent in interpretation. Other key practices are an emphasis on including the perspectives of the people being studied; cultural relativism, which considers values and beliefs within their cultural context; skepticism towards the notion that science can produce objective and universally valid knowledge; and rejection of grand narratives or theories that attempt to explain other cultures.

Anthropologists working in a postmodern vein seek to dissect, interpret, and write cultural critiques, analyzing of cultural texts and practices, rather than relying on empirical observation. The issue of subjectivity is a concern: as ethnographies are influenced by the perspective of the author, the question arises in the study of individual cultures as to whether the author&#x27;s opinions should be considered scientific. Clifford Geertz, considered a founding member of postmodernist anthropology, holds that, &quot;anthropological writings are themselves interpretations, and second and third order ones to boot. (By definition, only a &#x27;native&#x27; makes first order ones: it&#x27;s &quot;his&quot; culture.)&quot; In the 21st century, some anthropologists use a form of standpoint theory, which prioritizes the perspectives of the subject over the perspective of the observer in cultural interpretation.

=== Feminism ===

Postmodern feminism mixes postmodern theory and French feminism that rejects a universal female subject. The goal is to destabilize the patriarchal norms entrenched in society that have led to gender inequality. Essentialism, philosophy, and universal truths are opposed, in favor of embracing the differences that exist amongst women to demonstrate that not all women are the same. Applying universal truths to all women in a society minimizes individual experience; ideas displayed as the norm in society stem from masculine notions of how women should be portrayed.

Postmodern feminism seeks to analyze notions that have led to gender inequality, and attempts to promote equality through critiquing logocentrism, supporting multiple discourses, deconstructing texts, and seeking to promote subjectivity. This approach is not readily accepted by all feminists—some believe postmodern thought undermines the attacks that feminist theory attempts to create, while other feminists are in favor of the union.

=== Law ===

In response to the perceived shortcomings of legal formalism and positivism, postmodern legal scholars developed several new approaches to address both formal and ethical issues in jurisprudence. In particular, they emphasize the inequalities introduced to the legal system by such matters as race, gender, and economic status.

=== Psychology ===

In 1992, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported on &quot;a group of increasingly influential psychologists – postmodern psychologists seems to be the name that is sticking&quot;, who had come to the conclusion that &quot;the American conception of an isolated, unified self&quot; does not exist. People are composed of many different selves, constructed for different situations. In this way, postmodernism challenges the modernist view of psychology as the science of the individual, in favor of seeing humans as a cultural/communal product, dominated by language rather than by an inner self. 

In 2001, Kenneth Gergen, a pioneer in postmodern psychological theory, identified &quot;emphasis on the individual mind, an objectively knowable world, and language as carrier of truth&quot; as the cornerstones of traditional modernist psychology. He noted criticism of these assumptions coming from &quot;every quarter of the humanities and the sciences&quot;, and the emergence of a psychology in which &quot;colonialist universalism is replaced by a global conversation among equals&quot;. He also considered the &quot;strong critical reservation&quot;, including the realist argument that a socially constructed world cannot negate a clearly observable objective reality; the claim of incoherence, wherein postmodernism denies truth and objectivity while simultaneously making truth claims; and its moral relativism, which fails to take a principled ethical stand. Ultimately, he concluded that psychology&#x27;s future is &quot;hanging in the balance&quot;.

In 2021, psychologist Jan Smedslund discussed how psychology tried for decades to emulate the natural sciences and address unpredictable individual behavior. He described how the dominant methodology came to rely exclusively on statistical analysis of group-level data and average findings, whereby it &quot;lost contact with the psychological processes going on in individual persons.&quot; He advocated for abandoning the natural science approach that had &quot;led into a clearly discernible blind alley.&quot;

In 2024, American psychology professor Edwin Gantt wrote that psychology remains in a state of continual struggle &quot;to decide whether its true intellectual home is to be found among the humanities, especially philosophy and literature, or among the STEM disciplines.&quot; He finds psychology &quot;a key site where the intellectual tug-of-war between modernism and postmodernism plays itself out in academia.&quot;

=== Urban planning ===
Modernism sought to design and plan cities that followed the logic of the new model of industrial mass production; reverting to large-scale solutions, aesthetic standardization, and prefabricated design solutions. This approach was found to have eroded urban living by its failure to recognize differences and aim towards homogeneous landscapes. Jane Jacobs&#x27;s 1961 book &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities,&quot; was a sustained critique of urban planning as it had developed within modernism, and played a major role in turning public opinion against modernist planners, notably Robert Moses.

Postmodern urban planning involves theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, elevating uncertainty, flexibility, and change, and rejecting utopianism while embracing a utopian way of thinking and acting. The postmodernity of &quot;resistance&quot; seeks to deconstruct modernism, a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them. 

=== Theology ===

The postmodern theological movement interprets Christian theology in light of postmodern theory and various forms of post-Heideggerian thought, using approaches such as poststructuralism, phenomenology, and deconstruction to question fixed interpretations, explore the role of lived experience, and uncover hidden textual assumptions and contradictions. The movement emerged in the 1980s and 1990s when a handful of philosophers who took philosopher Martin Heidegger as a common point of departure began publishing books engaging with Christian theology.

Theologian Kevin J. Vanhoozer combines and expands on other scholarly classifications to present seven types of postmodern theology: postliberal, postmetaphysical, deconstructive, reconstructive, feminist, Anglo-American postmodernity, and radical orthodoxy. He notes that the typology should be considered &quot;provisional and fallible [yet] not entirely arbitrary&quot;, having met two main criteria: each is an approach taken by more than one theologian, and each &quot;believes itself to be responding to, rejecting, or passing through modernity, not inhabiting it.&quot;

==In popular culture==
=== Fashion ===

One manifestation of postmodernism in fashion explored alternatives to conventional concepts of elegance: Rei Kawakubo’s Spring/Summer 1997 collection featured &quot;dresses asymmetrically padded with goose down, creating bumps in unexpected areas of the body&quot;. Issey Miyake&#x27;s 1985 dreadlocks hat &quot;offered an immediate, yet impermanent, &#x27;multi-culti&#x27; fashion experience&quot;. Vivienne Westwood took &quot;an extremely polyglot approach&quot;, from early work with copies of 1950s clothes, to exploration of historic modes and cultural influences. In 1981, her first runway show, &quot;Pirate&quot;, merged British history, 18th- and 19th-century dress, and African textile design, with a rap and ethnic music soundtrack.

The postmodern fashion sensibility appeared also through the subcultures of the 1960s and 1970s. Hippies, punks and other countercultural groups constructed their own nonconformist identities through choices in music, drugs, slang, and appearance. As these styles gained mainstream popularity, critics claim they lost their deeper meaning: &quot;the adoption of surface attributes offers the frisson of rebellion without a commitment to a subcultural lifestyle.&quot;

=== Graphic design ===
Early mention of postmodernism in graphic design appeared in the British magazine, &quot;Design&quot;, during the late 1960s. The discussion took a pragmatic if not entirely comfortable view of graphic design as engaging with the economic necessities of a changing world. Graphic design had the role of &quot;active stylization of product surfaces (such as those of packaging and promotion)&quot;, engaging without moralizing with consumer desires. Editor Corin Hughes-Stanton concluded, &quot;Post-Modernism&#x27; is an attitude that takes the form of a creative response to unfolding developments in the socio-economic sphere; it is a sign of active engagement rather than an academic retreat from its commercial and professional concerns.&quot;

=== Marketing ===

Postmodernism in marketing focuses on customized experiences where broad market generalizations are no longer applied. According to academic Stephen Brown, &quot;Marketers know about consumers, consumers know about marketers, marketers know consumers know about marketers, and consumers know marketers know consumers know about marketers.&quot; Brown, writing in 1993, stated that the postmodern approach in many ways rejects attempts to impose order and work in silos. Instead marketers should work collectively with &quot;artistic&quot; attributes of intuition, creativity, spontaneity, speculation, emotion, and involvement.

==Ongoing influence==

Since the late 1990s, there has been a growing sentiment in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism &quot;has gone out of fashion&quot;. Others argue that postmodernism is dead in the context of current cultural production.

A 2020 study investigated the reported transition from postmodernism to post-postmodernism, those &quot;changing social conditions that lead the consumer to consume in a particular manner&quot;. Song lyrics were selected from Madonna (postmodern), Taylor Swift (post-postmodern), and Lady Gaga as a transitional example. Five postmodern characteristics consistently found in marketing literature were compared to their post-postmodern counterparts: anti-foundationalism to rewriting; dedifferentiation to redifferentiation; fragmentation to reengagement; reversal of production and consumption to rebalancing of production and consumption; and hyperreality to alternative reality. Postmodernism, it finds, &quot;remains vibrant, re-inventive, and calls for its demise may be somewhat overblown.&quot; Swift&#x27;s success &quot;suggests a significant shift from deconstructive to reconstructive positions regarding the self and its surroundings&quot;, noting that her &quot;post-postmodern engagement, enthusiasm and sincerity&quot; appeared to be &quot;somewhat superficial, sociopathic, and couched in fabulation.&quot;

The connection between postmodernism, posthumanism, and cyborgism has led to a challenge to postmodernism, for which the terms &quot;Post-postmodernism&quot; and &quot;postpoststructuralism&quot; were first coined in 2003. A small group of critics has put forth a range of theories that aim to describe culture or society in the alleged aftermath of postmodernism, most notably Raoul Eshelman (performatism), Gilles Lipovetsky (hypermodernity), Nicolas Bourriaud (altermodern), and Alan Kirby (digimodernism, formerly called pseudo-modernism). None of these new theories or labels have so far gained very widespread acceptance.

Writing in 2022, Steven Connor argues that, despite continuing reports of its death or imminent demise, postmodernism has instead undergone a kind of disappearance into our culture by way of assimilation. He notes there is little that can now be called postmodern style because &quot;the clashing or commingling of styles has become entirely routine at all levels of culture.&quot; The energizing antagonism between high and low culture has been &quot;pestled into a tepid porridge.&quot; And the general postmodern condition is now &quot;universal, irreversible and metastable, embodied above all in the massive increase in digitally mediated information technologies.&quot; According to Connor, postmodernism in the 2020s is a sensibility that has been integrated into everyday life, having been subject to a considerable degree of shifting, perhaps temporarily, from irony, pluralism and ambivalence to urgency, indignation, and reductive absolutism.

<text>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication. A person who captures or takes photographs is called a photographer.

Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically &quot;developed&quot; into a visible image, either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.

Before the emergence of digital photography, photographs on film had to be developed to produce negatives or projectable slides, and negatives had to be printed as positive images, usually in enlarged form. This was usually done by photographic laboratories, but many amateurs did their own processing.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;photography&quot; was created from the Greek roots (&#x27;), genitive of (&#x27;), &quot;light&quot; and (&quot;&quot;) &quot;representation by means of lines&quot; or &quot;drawing&quot;, together meaning &quot;drawing with light&quot;.

Several people may have coined the same new term from these roots independently. Hércules Florence, a French painter and inventor living in Campinas, Brazil, used the French form of the word, &quot;&quot;, in private notes which a Brazilian historian believes were written in 1834. This claim is widely reported but is not yet largely recognized internationally. The first use of the word by Florence became widely known after the research of Boris Kossoy in 1980.

On 25 February 1839, the German newspaper &#x27; published an article titled &#x27;, discussing several priority claims, especially that of Henry Fox Talbot&#x27;s, in relation to Daguerre&#x27;s claim of invention. The article is the earliest known occurrence of the word in public print. It was signed &quot;J.M.&quot;, believed to have been Berlin astronomer Johann von Maedler. The astronomer John Herschel is also credited with coining the word, independent of Talbot, in 1839.

The inventors Nicéphore Niépce, Talbot, and Louis Daguerre seem not to have known or used the word &quot;photography&quot;, but referred to their processes as &quot;Heliography&quot; (Niépce), &quot;Photogenic Drawing&quot;/&quot;Talbotype&quot;/&quot;Calotype&quot; (Talbot), and &quot;Daguerreotype&quot; (Daguerre).

== History ==

=== Precursor technologies ===

Photography is the result of combining several technical discoveries, relating to seeing an image and capturing the image. The discovery of the camera obscura (&quot;dark chamber&quot; in Latin) that provides an image of a scene dates back to ancient China. Greek mathematicians Aristotle and Euclid independently described a camera obscura in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. In the 6th century CE, Byzantine mathematician Anthemius of Tralles used a type of camera obscura in his experiments.

The Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) (965–1040) also invented a camera obscura as well as the first true pinhole camera. The invention of the camera has been traced back to the work of Ibn al-Haytham. While the effects of a single light passing through a pinhole had been described earlier, Ibn al-Haytham gave the first correct analysis of the camera obscura, including the first geometrical and quantitative descriptions of the phenomenon, and was the first to use a screen in a dark room so that an image from one side of a hole in the surface could be projected onto a screen on the other side. He also first understood the relationship between the focal point and the pinhole, and performed early experiments with afterimages, laying the foundations for the invention of photography in the 19th century.

Leonardo da Vinci mentions natural camerae obscurae that are formed by dark caves on the edge of a sunlit valley. A hole in the cave wall will act as a pinhole camera and project a laterally reversed, upside down image on a piece of paper. Renaissance painters used the camera obscura which, in fact, gives the optical rendering in color that dominates Western Art. It is a box with a small hole in one side, which allows specific light rays to enter, projecting an inverted image onto a viewing screen or paper.

The birth of photography was then concerned with inventing means to capture and keep the image produced by the camera obscura. Albertus Magnus (1193–1280) discovered silver nitrate, and Georg Fabricius (1516–1571) discovered silver chloride, and the techniques described in Ibn al-Haytham&#x27;s Book of Optics are capable of producing primitive photographs using medieval materials.

Daniele Barbaro described a diaphragm in 1566. Wilhelm Homberg described how light darkened some chemicals (photochemical effect) in 1694. Around 1717, Johann Heinrich Schulze used a light-sensitive slurry to capture images of cut-out letters on a bottle and on that basis many German sources and some international ones credit Schulze as the inventor of photography.
The fiction book &quot;Giphantie&quot;, published in 1760, by French author Tiphaigne de la Roche, described what can be interpreted as photography.

In June 1802, British inventor Thomas Wedgwood made the first known attempt to capture the image in a camera obscura by means of a light-sensitive substance. He used paper or white leather treated with silver nitrate. Although he succeeded in capturing the shadows of objects placed on the surface in direct sunlight, and even made shadow copies of paintings on glass, it was reported in 1802 that &quot;the images formed by means of a camera obscura have been found too faint to produce, in any moderate time, an effect upon the nitrate of silver.&quot; The shadow images eventually darkened all over.

=== Invention ===



The first permanent photoetching was an image produced in 1822 by the French inventor Nicéphore Niépce, but it was destroyed in a later attempt to make prints from it. Niépce was successful again in 1825. In 1826 he made the &quot;View from the Window at Le Gras&quot;, the earliest surviving photograph from nature (i.e., of the image of a real-world scene, as formed in a camera obscura by a lens).
Because Niépce&#x27;s camera photographs required an extremely long exposure (at least eight hours and probably several days), he sought to greatly improve his bitumen process or replace it with one that was more practical. In partnership with Louis Daguerre, he worked out post-exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more light-sensitive resin, but hours of exposure in the camera were still required. With an eye to eventual commercial exploitation, the partners opted for total secrecy.

Niépce died in 1833 and Daguerre then redirected the experiments toward the light-sensitive silver halides, which Niépce had abandoned many years earlier because of his inability to make the images he captured with them light-fast and permanent. Daguerre&#x27;s efforts culminated in what would later be named the daguerreotype process. The essential elements—a silver-plated surface sensitized by iodine vapor, developed by mercury vapor, and &quot;fixed&quot; with hot saturated salt water—were in place in 1837. The required exposure time was measured in minutes instead of hours. Daguerre took the earliest confirmed photograph of a person in 1838 while capturing a view of a Paris street: unlike the other pedestrian and horse-drawn traffic on the busy boulevard, which appears deserted, one man having his boots polished stood sufficiently still throughout the several-minutes-long exposure to be visible. The existence of Daguerre&#x27;s process was publicly announced, without details, on 7 January 1839. The news created an international sensation. France soon agreed to pay Daguerre a pension in exchange for the right to present his invention to the world as the gift of France, which occurred when complete working instructions were unveiled on 19 August 1839. In that same year, American photographer Robert Cornelius is credited with taking the earliest surviving photographic self-portrait.

In Brazil, Hercules Florence had apparently started working out a silver-salt-based paper process in 1832, later naming it &quot;Photographie&quot;.

Meanwhile, a British inventor, William Fox Talbot, had succeeded in making crude but reasonably light-fast silver images on paper as early as 1834 but had kept his work secret. After reading about Daguerre&#x27;s invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method in a paper to the Royal Society and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot&#x27;s paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the camera, but in 1840 he created the calotype process, which used the chemical development of a latent image to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot&#x27;s process, unlike Daguerre&#x27;s, created a translucent negative which could be used to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera. Talbot&#x27;s famous tiny paper negative of the Oriel window in Lacock Abbey, one of a number of camera photographs he made in the summer of 1835, may be the oldest camera negative in existence.

In March 1837, Steinheil, along with Franz von Kobell, used silver chloride and a cardboard camera to make pictures in negative of the Frauenkirche and other buildings in Munich, then taking another picture of the negative to get a positive, the actual black and white reproduction of a view on the object. The pictures produced were round with a diameter of 4 cm, the method was later named the &quot;Steinheil method&quot;.

In France, Hippolyte Bayard invented his own process for producing direct positive paper prints and claimed to have invented photography earlier than Daguerre or Talbot.

British chemist John Herschel made many contributions to the new field. He invented the cyanotype process, later familiar as the &quot;blueprint&quot;. He was the first to use the terms &quot;photography&quot;, &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;positive&quot;. He had discovered in 1819 that sodium thiosulphate was a solvent of silver halides, and in 1839 he informed Talbot (and, indirectly, Daguerre) that it could be used to &quot;fix&quot; silver-halide-based photographs and make them completely light-fast. He made the first glass negative in late 1839.

In the March 1851 issue of &quot;The Chemist&quot;, Frederick Scott Archer published his wet plate collodion process. It became the most widely used photographic medium until the gelatin dry plate, introduced in the 1870s, eventually replaced it. There are three subsets to the collodion process; the Ambrotype (a positive image on glass), the Ferrotype or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive prints on albumen or salted paper.

Many advances in photographic glass plates and printing were made during the rest of the 19th century. In 1891, Gabriel Lippmann introduced a process for making natural-color photographs based on the optical phenomenon of the interference of light waves. His scientifically elegant and important but ultimately impractical invention earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908.

Glass plates were the medium for most original camera photography from the late 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized amateur photography, early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old. Because of the superior dimensional stability of glass, the use of plates for some scientific applications, such as astrophotography, continued into the 1990s, and in the niche field of laser holography, it has persisted into the 21st century.

=== Film ===

Hurter and Driffield began pioneering work on the light sensitivity of photographic emulsions in 1876. Their work enabled the first quantitative measure of film speed to be devised.

The first flexible photographic roll film was marketed by George Eastman, founder of Kodak in 1885, but this original &quot;film&quot; was actually a coating on a paper base. As part of the processing, the image-bearing layer was stripped from the paper and transferred to a hardened gelatin support. The first transparent plastic roll film followed in 1889. It was made from highly flammable nitrocellulose known as nitrate film.

Although cellulose acetate or &quot;safety film&quot; had been introduced by Kodak in 1908, at first it found only a few special applications as an alternative to the hazardous nitrate film, which had the advantages of being considerably tougher, slightly more transparent, and cheaper. The changeover was not completed for X-ray films until 1933, and although safety film was always used for 16 mm and 8 mm home movies, nitrate film remained standard for theatrical 35 mm motion pictures until it was finally discontinued in 1951.

Films remained the dominant form of photography until the early 21st century when advances in digital photography drew consumers to digital formats. Although modern photography is dominated by digital users, film continues to be used by enthusiasts and professional photographers. The distinctive &quot;look&quot; of film based photographs compared to digital images is likely due to a combination of factors, including (1) differences in spectral and tonal sensitivity (S-shaped density-to-exposure (H&amp;D curve) with film vs. linear response curve for digital CCD sensors), (2) resolution, and (3) continuity of tone.

=== Black-and-white ===


Originally, all photography was monochrome, or &quot;black-and-white&quot;. Even after color film was readily available, black-and-white photography continued to dominate for decades, due to its lower cost, chemical stability, and its &quot;classic&quot; photographic look. The tones and contrast between light and dark areas define black-and-white photography. Monochromatic pictures are not necessarily composed of pure blacks, whites, and intermediate shades of gray but can involve shades of one particular hue depending on the process. The cyanotype process, for example, produces an image composed of blue tones. The albumen print process, publicly revealed in 1847, produces brownish tones.

Many photographers continue to produce some monochrome images, sometimes because of the established archival permanence of well-processed silver-halide-based materials. Some full-color digital images are processed using a variety of techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard RGB color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.

=== Color ===
Color photography was explored beginning in the 1840s. Early experiments in color required extremely long exposures (hours or days for camera images) and could not &quot;fix&quot; the photograph to prevent the color from quickly fading when exposed to white light.

The first permanent color photograph was taken in 1861 using the three-color-separation principle first published by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1855. The foundation of virtually all practical color processes, Maxwell&#x27;s idea was to take three separate black-and-white photographs through red, green and blue filters. This provides the photographer with the three basic channels required to recreate a color image. Transparent prints of the images could be projected through similar color filters and superimposed on the projection screen, an additive method of color reproduction. A color print on paper could be produced by superimposing carbon prints of the three images made in their complementary colors, a subtractive method of color reproduction pioneered by Louis Ducos du Hauron in the late 1860s.

Russian photographer Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii made extensive use of this color separation technique, employing a special camera which successively exposed the three color-filtered images on different parts of an oblong plate. Because his exposures were not simultaneous, unsteady subjects exhibited color &quot;fringes&quot; or, if rapidly moving through the scene, appeared as brightly colored ghosts in the resulting projected or printed images.

Implementation of color photography was hindered by the limited sensitivity of early photographic materials, which were mostly sensitive to blue, only slightly sensitive to green, and virtually insensitive to red. The discovery of dye sensitization by photochemist Hermann Vogel in 1873 suddenly made it possible to add sensitivity to green, yellow and even red. Improved color sensitizers and ongoing improvements in the overall sensitivity of emulsions steadily reduced the once-prohibitive long exposure times required for color, bringing it ever closer to commercial viability.

Autochrome, the first commercially successful color process, was introduced by the Lumière brothers in 1907. Autochrome plates incorporated a mosaic color filter layer made of dyed grains of potato starch, which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After an Autochrome plate was reversal processed to produce a positive transparency, the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing the color of the subject by the additive method. Autochrome plates were one of several varieties of additive color screen plates and films marketed between the 1890s and the 1950s.

Kodachrome, the first modern &quot;integral tripack&quot; (or &quot;monopack&quot;) color film, was introduced by Kodak in 1935. It captured the three color components in a multi-layer emulsion. One layer was sensitized to record the red-dominated part of the spectrum, another layer recorded only the green part and a third recorded only the blue. Without special film processing, the result would simply be three superimposed black-and-white images, but complementary cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images were created in those layers by adding color couplers during a complex processing procedure.

Agfa&#x27;s similarly structured Agfacolor Neu was introduced in 1936. Unlike Kodachrome, the color couplers in Agfacolor Neu were incorporated into the emulsion layers during manufacture, which greatly simplified the processing. Currently, available color films still employ a multi-layer emulsion and the same principles, most closely resembling Agfa&#x27;s product.

Instant color film, used in a special camera which yielded a unique finished color print only a minute or two after the exposure, was introduced by Polaroid in 1963.

Color photography may form images as positive transparencies, which can be used in a slide projector, or as color negatives intended for use in creating positive color enlargements on specially coated paper. The latter is now the most common form of film (non-digital) color photography owing to the introduction of automated photo printing equipment. After a transition period centered around 1995–2005, color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multi-megapixel digital cameras. Film continues to be the preference of some photographers because of its distinctive &quot;look&quot;.

=== Digital ===

In 1981, Sony unveiled the first consumer camera to use a charge-coupled device for imaging, eliminating the need for film: the Sony Mavica. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, and the camera was not fully digital.

The first digital camera to both record and save images in a digital format was the Fujix DS-1P created by Fujifilm in 1988.

In 1991, Kodak unveiled the DCS 100, the first commercially available digital single-lens reflex camera. Although its high cost precluded uses other than photojournalism and professional photography, commercial digital photography was born.

Digital imaging uses an electronic image sensor to record the image as a set of electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film. An important difference between digital and chemical photography is that chemical photography resists photo manipulation because it involves film and photographic paper, while digital imaging is a highly manipulative medium. This difference allows for a degree of image post-processing that is comparatively difficult in film-based photography and permits different communicative potentials and applications.
Digital photography dominates the 21st century. More than 99% of photographs taken around the world are through digital cameras, increasingly through smartphones.

== Techniques ==

A large variety of photographic techniques and media are used in the process of capturing images for photography. These include the camera; dualphotography; full-spectrum, ultraviolet and infrared media; light field photography; and other imaging techniques.

=== Cameras ===

The camera is the image-forming device, and a photographic plate, photographic film or a silicon electronic image sensor is the capture medium. The respective recording medium can be the plate or film itself, or a digital magnetic or electronic memory.

Photographers control the camera and lens to &quot;expose&quot; the light recording material to the required amount of light to form a &quot;latent image&quot; (on plate or film) or RAW file (in digital cameras) which, after appropriate processing, is converted to a usable image. Digital cameras use an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive electronics such as charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be reproduced on a paper.

The camera (or &#x27;camera obscura&#x27;) is a dark room or chamber from which, as far as possible, all light is excluded except the light that forms the image. It was discovered and used in the 16th century by painters. The subject being photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range from small to very large, a whole room that is kept dark while the object to be photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated. This was common for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used (see Process camera).

As soon as photographic materials became &quot;fast&quot; (sensitive) enough for taking candid or surreptitious pictures, small &quot;detective&quot; cameras were made, some actually disguised as a book or handbag or pocket watch (the &quot;Ticka&quot; camera) or even worn hidden behind an Ascot necktie with a tie pin that was really the lens.

The movie camera is a type of photographic camera that takes a rapid sequence of photographs on recording medium. In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images, each called a &quot;frame&quot;. This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism. The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific speed, called the &quot;frame rate&quot; (number of frames per second). While viewing, a person&#x27;s eyes and brain merge the separate pictures to create the illusion of motion.

=== Stereoscopic ===

Photographs, both monochrome and color, can be captured and displayed through two side-by-side images that emulate human stereoscopic vision. Stereoscopic photography was the first that captured figures in motion. While known colloquially as &quot;3-D&quot; photography, the more accurate term is stereoscopy. Such cameras have long been realized by using film and more recently in digital electronic methods (including cell phone cameras).

=== Dualphotography ===
Dualphotography consists of photographing a scene from both sides of a photographic device at once (e.g. camera for back-to-back dualphotography, or two networked cameras for portal-plane dualphotography). The dualphoto apparatus can be used to simultaneously capture both the subject and the photographer, or both sides of a geographical place at once, thus adding a supplementary narrative layer to that of a single image.

=== Full-spectrum, ultraviolet and infrared ===

Ultraviolet and infrared films have been available for many decades and employed in a variety of photographic avenues since the 1960s. New technological trends in digital photography have opened a new direction in full spectrum photography, where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet, visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.

Modified digital cameras can detect some ultraviolet, all of the visible and much of the near infrared spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350 nm to 1000 nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared hot mirror filter that blocks most of the infrared and a bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400 nm to 700 nm.

Replacing a hot mirror or infrared blocking filter with an infrared pass or a wide spectrally transmitting filter allows the camera to detect the wider spectrum light at greater sensitivity. Without the hot-mirror, the red, green and blue (or cyan, yellow and magenta) colored micro-filters placed over the sensor elements pass varying amounts of ultraviolet (blue window) and infrared (primarily red and somewhat lesser the green and blue micro-filters).

Uses of full spectrum photography are for fine art photography, geology, forensics and law enforcement.

===Layering===
Layering is a photographic composition technique that manipulates the foreground, subject or middle-ground, and background layers in a way that they all work together to tell a story through the image. Layers may be incorporated by altering the focal length, distorting the perspective by positioning the camera in a certain spot. People, movement, light and a variety of objects can be used in layering.

=== Light field ===

Digital methods of image capture and display processing have enabled the new technology of &quot;light field photography&quot; (also known as synthetic aperture photography). This process allows focusing at various depths of field to be selected &quot;after&quot; the photograph has been captured. As explained by Michael Faraday in 1846, the &quot;light field&quot; is understood as 5-dimensional, with each point in 3-D space having attributes of two more angles that define the direction of each ray passing through that point.

These additional vector attributes can be captured optically through the use of microlenses at each pixel point within the 2-dimensional image sensor. Every pixel of the final image is actually a selection from each sub-array located under each microlens, as identified by a post-image capture focus algorithm.

=== Other ===
Besides the camera, other methods of forming images with light are available. For instance, a photocopy or xerography machine forms permanent images but uses the transfer of static electrical charges rather than photographic medium, hence the term electrophotography. Photograms are images produced by the shadows of objects cast on the photographic paper, without the use of a camera. Objects can also be placed directly on the glass of an image scanner to produce digital pictures.

== Types ==

=== Amateur ===
Amateur photographers take photos for personal use, as a hobby or out of casual interest, rather than as a business or job. The quality of amateur work can be comparable to that of many professionals. Amateurs can fill a gap in subjects or topics that might not otherwise be photographed if they are not commercially useful or salable. Amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the hand-held camera. Twenty-first century social media and near-ubiquitous camera phones have made photographic and video recording pervasive in everyday life. In the mid-2010s smartphone cameras added numerous automatic assistance features like color management, autofocus face detection and image stabilization that significantly decreased skill and effort needed to take high quality images.

=== Commercial ===

Commercial photography is probably best defined as any photography for which the photographer is paid for images rather than works of art. In this light, money could be paid for the subject of the photograph or the photograph itself. The commercial photographic world could include:
* Advertising photography: There are photographs made to illustrate and usually sell a service or product. These images, such as packshots, are generally done with an advertising agency, design firm or with an in-house corporate design team.
* Architectural photography focuses on capturing photographs of buildings and architectural structures that are aesthetically pleasing and accurate in terms of representations of their subjects.
* Event photography focuses on photographing guests and occurrences at mostly social events.
* Fashion and glamour photography usually incorporates models and is a form of advertising photography. Fashion photography, like the work featured in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, emphasizes clothes and other products; glamour emphasizes the model and body form while glamour photography is popular in advertising and men&#x27;s magazines. Models in glamour photography sometimes work nude.
* 360 product photography displays a series of photos to give the impression of a rotating object. This technique is commonly used by ecommerce websites to help shoppers visualise products.
* Concert photography focuses on capturing candid images of both the artist or band as well as the atmosphere (including the crowd). Many of these photographers work freelance and are contracted through an artist or their management to cover a specific show. Concert photographs are often used to promote the artist or band in addition to the venue.
* Crime scene photography consists of photographing scenes of crime such as robberies and murders. A black and white camera or an infrared camera may be used to capture specific details.
* Still life photography usually depicts inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which may be either natural or man-made. Still life is a broader category for food and some natural photography and can be used for advertising purposes.
* Real estate photography focuses on the production of photographs showcasing a property that is for sale, such photographs requires the use of wide-lens and extensive knowledge in high-dynamic-range imaging photography.

* Food photography can be used for editorial, packaging or advertising use. Food photography is similar to still life photography but requires some special skills.
* Photojournalism can be considered a subset of editorial photography. Photographs made in this context are accepted as a documentation of a news story.
* Paparazzi is a form of photojournalism in which the photographer captures candid images of athletes, celebrities, politicians, and other prominent people.
* Portrait and wedding photography: Are photographs made and sold directly to the end user of the images.
* Landscape photography typically captures the presence of nature but can also focus on human-made features or disturbances of landscapes.
* Wildlife photography demonstrates the life of wild animals.

=== Art ===

During the 20th century, both fine art photography and documentary photography became accepted by the English-speaking art world and the gallery system. In the United States, a handful of photographers, including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, John Szarkowski, F. Holland Day, and Edward Weston, spent their lives advocating for photography as a fine art.
At first, fine art photographers tried to imitate painting styles. This movement is called Pictorialism, often using soft focus for a dreamy, &#x27;romantic&#x27; look. In reaction to that, Weston, Ansel Adams, and others formed the Group f/64 to advocate &#x27;straight photography&#x27;, the photograph as a (sharply focused) thing in itself and not an imitation of something else.

The aesthetics of photography is a matter that continues to be discussed regularly, especially in artistic circles. Many artists argued that photography was the mechanical reproduction of an image. If photography is authentically art, then photography in the context of art would need redefinition, such as determining what component of a photograph makes it beautiful to the viewer. The controversy began with the earliest images &quot;written with light&quot;; Nicéphore Niépce, Louis Daguerre, and others among the very earliest photographers were met with acclaim, but some questioned if their work met the definitions and purposes of art.

Clive Bell in his classic essay &quot;Art&quot; states that only &quot;significant form&quot; can distinguish art from what is not art.

On 7 February 2007, Sotheby&#x27;s London sold the 2001 photograph &quot;99 Cent II Diptychon&quot; for an unprecedented $3,346,456 to an anonymous bidder, making it the most expensive at the time.

Conceptual photography turns a concept or idea into a photograph. Even though what is depicted in the photographs are real objects, the subject is strictly abstract.
In parallel to this development, the then largely separate interface between painting and photography was closed in the second half of the 20th century with the chemigram of Pierre Cordier and the chemogram of Josef H. Neumann. In 1974 the chemograms by Josef H. Neumann concluded the separation of the painterly background and the photographic layer by showing the picture elements in a symbiosis that had never existed before, as an unmistakable unique specimen, in a simultaneous painterly and at the same time real photographic perspective, using lenses, within a photographic layer, united in colors and shapes. This Neumann chemogram from the 1970s thus differs from the beginning of the previously created cameraless chemigrams of a Pierre Cordier and the photogram Man Ray or László Moholy-Nagy of the previous decades. These works of art were almost simultaneous with the invention of photography by various important artists who characterized Hippolyte Bayard, Thomas Wedgwood, William Henry Fox Talbot in their early stages, and later Man Ray and László Moholy-Nagy in the twenties and by the painter in the thirties Edmund Kesting and Christian Schad by draping objects directly onto appropriately sensitized photo paper and using a light source without a camera.
=== Photojournalism ===
Photojournalism is a particular form of photography (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell a news story. It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, but in some cases the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, street photography or celebrity photography) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door. They deliver news in a creative format that is not only informative, but also entertaining, including sports photography.

=== Science and forensics ===

The camera has a long and distinguished history as a means of recording scientific phenomena from the first use by Daguerre and Fox-Talbot, such as astronomical events (eclipses for example), small creatures and plants when the camera was attached to the eyepiece of microscopes (in photomicroscopy) and for macro photography of larger specimens. The camera also proved useful in recording crime scenes and the scenes of accidents, such as the Wootton bridge collapse in 1861. The methods used in analysing photographs for use in legal cases are collectively known as forensic photography. Crime scene photos are usually taken from three vantage points: overview, mid-range, and close-up.

In 1845 Francis Ronalds, the Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory, invented the first successful camera to make continuous recordings of meteorological and geomagnetic parameters. Different machines produced 12- or 24- hour photographic traces of the minute-by-minute variations of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, atmospheric electricity, and the three components of geomagnetic forces. The cameras were supplied to numerous observatories around the world and some remained in use until well into the 20th century. Charles Brooke a little later developed similar instruments for the Greenwich Observatory.

Science regularly uses image technology that has derived from the design of the pinhole camera to avoid distortions that can be caused by lenses. X-ray machines are similar in design to pinhole cameras, with high-grade filters and laser radiation.
Photography has become universal in recording events and data in science and engineering, and at crime scenes or accident scenes. The method has been much extended by using other wavelengths, such as infrared photography and ultraviolet photography, as well as spectroscopy. Those methods were first used in the Victorian era and improved much further since that time.

The first photographed atom was discovered in 2012 by physicists at Griffith University, Australia. They used an electric field to trap an &quot;Ion&quot; of the element, Ytterbium. The image was recorded on a CCD, an electronic photographic film.

=== Wildlife photography ===
Wildlife photography involves capturing images of various forms of wildlife. Unlike other forms of photography such as product or food photography, successful wildlife photography requires a photographer to choose the right place and right time when specific wildlife are present and active. It often requires great patience and considerable skill and command of the right photographic equipment.

== Social and cultural implications ==

There are many ongoing questions about different aspects of photography. In her &quot;On Photography&quot; (1977), Susan Sontag dismisses the objectivity of photography. This is a highly debated subject within the photographic community. Sontag argues, &quot;To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting one&#x27;s self into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge, and therefore like power.&quot; Photographers decide what to take a photo of, what elements to exclude and what angle to frame the photo, and these factors may reflect a particular socio-historical context. Along these lines, it can be argued that photography is a subjective form of representation.

Modern photography has raised a number of concerns on its effect on society. In Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), the camera is presented as promoting voyeurism. &#x27;Although the camera is an observation station, the act of photographing is more than passive observing&#x27;.
The camera doesn&#x27;t rape or even possess, though it may presume, intrude, trespass, distort, exploit, and, at the farthest reach of metaphor, assassinate – all activities that, unlike the sexual push and shove, can be conducted from a distance, and with some detachment.
Digital imaging has raised ethical concerns because of the ease of manipulating digital photographs in post-processing. Many photojournalists have declared they will not crop their pictures or are forbidden from combining elements of multiple photos to make &quot;photomontages&quot;, passing them as &quot;real&quot; photographs. Today&#x27;s technology has made image editing relatively simple for even the novice photographer. However, recent changes of in-camera processing allow digital fingerprinting of photos to detect tampering for purposes of forensic photography.

Photography is one of the new media forms that changes perception and changes the structure of society. Further unease has been caused around cameras in regards to desensitization. Fears that disturbing or explicit images are widely accessible to children and society at large have been raised. Particularly, photos of war and pornography are causing a stir. Sontag is concerned that &quot;to photograph is to turn people into objects that can be symbolically possessed&quot;. Desensitization discussion goes hand in hand with debates about censored images. Sontag writes of her concern that the ability to censor pictures means the photographer has the ability to construct reality.

One of the practices through which photography constitutes society is tourism. Tourism and photography combine to create a &quot;tourist gaze&quot;
in which local inhabitants are positioned and defined by the camera lens. However, it has also been argued that there exists a &quot;reverse gaze&quot; through which indigenous photographees can position the tourist photographer as a shallow consumer of images.

== Law ==
Photography is both restricted and protected by the law in many jurisdictions. Protection of photographs is typically achieved through the granting of copyright or moral rights to the photographer. In the United States, photography is protected as a First Amendment right and anyone is free to photograph anything seen in public spaces as long as it is in plain view. In the UK, a recent law (Counter-Terrorism Act 2008) increases the power of the police to prevent people, even press photographers, from taking pictures in public places. In South Africa, any person may photograph any other person, without their permission, in public spaces and the only specific restriction placed on what may not be photographed by government is related to anything classed as national security. Each country has different laws.

<doc id="23612" wikidata="Q647114" url="?curid=23612" title="Postmodern philosophy">
<text>Postmodern philosophy is a philosophical movement that arose in the second half of the 20th century as a critical response to assumptions allegedly present in modernist philosophical ideas regarding culture, identity, history, or language that were developed during the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment. Postmodernist thinkers developed concepts like &quot;différance&quot;, repetition, trace, and hyperreality to subvert &quot;grand narratives&quot;, univocity of being, and epistemic certainty. Postmodern philosophy questions the importance of power relationships, personalization, and discourse in the &quot;construction&quot; of truth and world views. Many postmodernists appear to deny that an objective reality exists, and appear to deny that there are objective moral values.

Jean-François Lyotard defined philosophical postmodernism in &quot;The Postmodern Condition&quot;, writing &quot;Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards meta narratives...&quot; where what he means by metanarrative is something like a unified, complete, universal, and epistemically certain story about everything that is. Postmodernists reject metanarratives because they reject the conceptualization of truth that metanarratives presuppose. Postmodernist philosophers in general argue that truth is always contingent on historical and social context rather than being absolute and universal and that truth is always partial and &quot;at issue&quot; rather than being complete and certain.

Postmodern philosophy is often particularly skeptical about simple binary oppositions characteristic of structuralism, emphasizing the problem of the philosopher cleanly distinguishing knowledge from ignorance, social progress from reversion, dominance from submission, good from bad, and presence from absence.

== Subjects ==
=== On Literature ===
Postmodern philosophy has had strong relations with the substantial literature of critical theory, although some critical theorists such as Jurgen Habermas have opposed postmodern philosophy.

=== On The Enlightenment ===
Many postmodern claims are critical of certain 18th-century Enlightenment values. Some postmodernists tolerate multiple conceptions of morality, even if they disagree with them subjectively. Postmodern writings often focus on deconstructing the role that power and ideology play in shaping discourse and belief. Postmodern philosophy shares ontological similarities with classical skeptical and relativistic belief systems.

=== On Truth and Objectivity ===
According to David Novitz, philosophical postmodernism challenges the notion that truth can be achieved. The &quot;Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; states that &quot;The assumption that there is no common denominator in &#x27;nature&#x27; or &#x27;truth&#x27; ... that guarantees the possibility of neutral or objective thought&quot; is a key assumption of postmodernism. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy describes it as &quot;a set of critical, strategic and rhetorical practices employing concepts such as difference, repetition, the trace, the simulacrum, and hyperreality to destabilize other concepts such as presence, identity, historical progress, epistemic certainty, and the univocity of meaning.&quot; The National Research Council has characterized the belief that &quot;social science research can never generate objective or trustworthy knowledge&quot; as an example of a postmodernist belief. Jean-François Lyotard&#x27;s seminal 1979 &quot;The Postmodern Condition&quot; stated that its hypotheses &quot;should not be accorded predictive value in relation to reality, but strategic value in relation to the questions raised&quot;. Lyotard&#x27;s statement in 1984 that &quot;I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives&quot; extends to incredulity toward science. Jacques Derrida, who is generally identified as a postmodernist, stated that &quot;every referent, all reality has the structure of a differential trace&quot;. There are strong similarities with post-modernism in the work of Paul Feyerabend; Feyerabend held that modern science is no more justified than witchcraft, and has denounced the &quot;tyranny&quot; of &quot;abstract concepts such as &#x27;truth&#x27;, &#x27;reality&#x27;, or &#x27;objectivity&#x27;, which narrow people&#x27;s vision and ways of being in the world&quot;. Defenders of postmodernism state that many descriptions of postmodernism exaggerate its antipathy to science; for example, Feyerabend denied that he was &quot;anti-science&quot;, accepted that some scientific &quot;theories&quot; are superior to other theories (even if science itself is not superior to other modes of inquiry), and attempted conventional medical treatments during his fight against cancer.

== Influences ==
Postmodern philosophy was greatly influenced by the writings of Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche in the 19th century and other early-to-mid 20th-century philosophers, including the phenomenologist Martin Heidegger, the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, cultural critic Roland Barthes, theorist Georges Bataille, and the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein.

Postmodern philosophy also drew from the world of the arts and architecture, particularly Marcel Duchamp, John Cage, and artists who practiced collage.

==Postmodern philosophers==
=== Michel Foucault ===
Michel Foucault is often cited as an early postmodernist although he personally rejected that label. Following Nietzsche, Foucault argued that knowledge is produced through the operations of &quot;power&quot;, and changes fundamentally in different historical periods.

===Jean Baudrillard===
Baudrillard, known for his simulation theory, argued that the individual&#x27;s experience and perception of reality derives its basis entirely from media-propagated ideals and images. The real and fantasy become indistinguishable, leading to the emergence of a wide-spread simulation of reality.

=== Jean François Lyotard ===
The writings of Lyotard were largely concerned with the role of narrative in human culture, and particularly how that role has changed as we have left modernity and entered a &quot;postindustrial&quot; or postmodern condition. He argued that modern philosophies legitimized their truth-claims not (as they themselves claimed) on logical or empirical grounds, but rather on the grounds of accepted stories (or &quot;metanarratives&quot;) about knowledge and the world—comparing these with Wittgenstein&#x27;s concept of language-games. He further argued that in our postmodern condition, these metanarratives no longer work to legitimize truth-claims. He suggested that in the wake of the collapse of modern metanarratives, people are developing a new &quot;language-game&quot;—one that does not make claims to absolute truth but rather celebrates a world of ever-changing relationships (among people and between people and the world).

=== Jacques Derrida ===
Derrida, the father of deconstruction, practiced philosophy as a form of textual criticism. He criticized Western philosophy as privileging the concept of presence and &quot;logos&quot;, as opposed to absence and markings or writings.

====Gilles Deleuze on productive difference====
The work of Gilles Deleuze developed a concept of as a productive mechanism, rather than as a merely negative phenomenon. He advocated for a critique of reason that emphasizes sensibility and feeling over rational judgment. Following Nietzsche, Deleuze argued that philosophical critique is an encounter between thought and what forces it into action, and that this requires training, discipline, inventiveness, and even a certain &quot;cruelty&quot;. He believed that thought cannot activate itself, but needs external forces to awaken and move it. Art, science, and philosophy can provide such activation through their transformative and experimental nature.

===Richard Rorty===
In the United States, a well-known pragmatist and self-proclaimed postmodernist was Richard Rorty. An analytic philosopher, Rorty believed that combining Willard Van Orman Quine&#x27;s criticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction with Wilfrid Sellars&#x27;s critique of the &quot;Myth of the Given&quot; allowed for an abandonment of the view of the thought or language as a mirror of a reality or an external world. Further, drawing upon Donald Davidson&#x27;s criticism of the dualism between conceptual scheme and empirical content, he challenges the sense of questioning whether our particular concepts are related to the world in an appropriate way, whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways. He argued that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of a social practice and language was what served our purposes in a particular time; ancient languages are sometimes untranslatable into modern ones because they possess a different vocabulary and are unuseful today. Donald Davidson is not usually considered a postmodernist, although he and Rorty have both acknowledged that there are few differences between their philosophies.

=== Douglas Kellner ===
Douglas Kellner insists that the &quot;assumptions and procedures of modern theory&quot; must be forgotten. Kellner analyzes the terms of this theory in real-life experiences and examples. Kellner uses science and technology studies as a major part of his analysis; he urges that the theory is incomplete without it. The scale is larger than just postmodernism alone; it must be interpreted through cultural studies where science and technology studies play a large role. The reality of the September 11 attacks on the United States of America is the catalyst for his explanation. In response, Kellner continues to examine the repercussions of understanding the effects of the 11 September attacks. He questions if the attacks are only able to be understood in a limited form of postmodern theory due to the level of irony. The conclusion he depicts is simple: postmodernism, as most use it today, will decide what experiences and signs in one&#x27;s reality will be one&#x27;s reality as they know it.

== Criticism ==
Some criticism responds to postmodernist skepticism towards objective reality and claims that truth and morality are relative, including the argument that this relativism is self-contradictory. In part in reference to postmodernism, conservative English philosopher Roger Scruton wrote, &quot;A writer who says that there are no truths, or that all truth is &#x27;merely relative,&#x27; is asking you not to believe him. So don&#x27;t.&quot; In 2014, the philosophers Theodore Schick and Lewis Vaughn wrote: &quot;the statement that &#x27;No unrestricted universal generalizations are true&#x27; is itself an unrestricted universal generalization. So if relativism in any of its forms is true, it&#x27;s false.&quot; Some responses to postmodernist relativism argue that, contrary to its proponents&#x27; usual intentions, it does not necessarily benefit the political left. For example, the historian Richard J. Evans argued that if relativism rejects truth, it can legitimize far-right pseudohistory such as Holocaust denial.

Further lines of criticism are that postmodernist discourse is characterized by obscurantism, that the term itself is vaguely defined, and that postmodernism lacks a clear epistemology. The linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky accused postmodernist intellectuals of failing to meaningfully answer questions such as &quot;what are the principles of their theories, on what evidence are they based, what do they explain that wasn&#x27;t already obvious, etc.?&quot; 

The French psychotherapist and philosopher, Félix Guattari, rejected its theoretical assumptions by arguing that the structuralist and postmodernist visions of the world were not flexible enough to seek explanations in psychological, social, and environmental domains at the same time. In an interview with Truls Lie, Jean Baudrillard noted: &quot;[Transmodernism, etc.] are better terms than &quot;postmodernism&quot;. It is not about modernity; it is about every system that has developed its mode of expression to the extent that it surpasses itself and its own logic. This is what I am trying to analyze.&quot; &quot;There is no longer any ontologically secret substance. I perceive this to be nihilism rather than postmodernism.&quot;

<text>Postmodern music is music in the art music tradition produced in the postmodern era. It also describes any music that follows aesthetical and philosophical trends of postmodernism. As an aesthetic movement it was formed partly in reaction to modernism but is not primarily defined as oppositional to modernist music. Postmodernists question the tight definitions and categories of academic disciplines, which they regard simply as the remnants of modernity.

==The postmodernist musical attitude==
Postmodernism in music is not a distinct musical style, but rather refers to music of the postmodern era. Postmodernist music, on the other hand, shares characteristics with postmodernist art—that is, art that comes after and reacts against modernism (see Modernism in Music). Rebecca Day, Lecturer in Music Analysis, writes &quot;within music criticism, postmodernism is seen to represent a conscious move away from the perceptibly damaging hegemony of binaries such as aestheticism/formalism, subject/object, unity/disunity, part/whole, that were seen to dominate former aesthetic discourse, and that when left unchallenged (as postmodernists claim of modernist discourse) are thought to de-humanise music analysis&quot;.

Fredric Jameson, a major figure in the thinking on postmodernism and culture, calls postmodernism &quot;the cultural dominant of the logic of late capitalism&quot;, meaning that, through globalization, postmodern culture is tied inextricably with capitalism (Mark Fisher, writing 20 years later, goes further, essentially calling it the sole cultural possibility). Drawing from Jameson and other theorists, David Beard and Kenneth Gloag argue that, in music, postmodernism is not just an attitude but also an inevitability in the current cultural climate of fragmentation. As early as 1938, Theodor Adorno had already identified a trend toward the dissolution of &quot;a culturally dominant set of values&quot;, citing the commodification of all genres as beginning of the end of genre or value distinctions in music.

In some respects, Postmodern music could be categorized as simply the music of the postmodern era, or music that follows aesthetic and philosophical trends of postmodernism, but with Jameson in mind, it is clear these definitions are inadequate. As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly in reaction to the ideals of modernism, but in fact postmodern music is more to do with functionality and the effect of globalization than it is with a specific reaction, movement, or attitude. In the face of capitalism, Jameson says, &quot;It is safest to grasp the concept of the postmodern as an attempt to think the present historically in an age that has forgotten how to think historically in the first place&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Jonathan Kramer posits the idea (following Umberto Eco and Jean-François Lyotard) that postmodernism (including &quot;musical&quot; postmodernism) is less a surface style or historical period (i.e., condition) than an &quot;attitude&quot;. Each philosopher interprets the term Postmodernism differently. Lawrence Kramer uses it very loosely and explains it as susceptible to mere trends. He loosely follows Jean Francois Lyotard&#x27;s views of synthesizing schemes, unity coherence, generality, totality, and structure losing their authority.  These strategies of understanding are incorrigibly interdisciplinary and plural and rather see it made as a system over an ethos. Kramer enumerates 16 (arguably subjective) &quot;characteristics of postmodern music, by which I mean music that is understood in a postmodern manner, or that calls forth postmodern listening strategies, or that provides postmodern listening experiences, or that exhibits postmodern compositional practices.&quot; According to Kramer, postmodern music:

# is not simply a repudiation of modernism or its continuation, but has aspects of both a break and an extension
# is, on some level and in some way, ironic
# does not respect boundaries between sonorities and procedures of the past and of the present
# challenges barriers between &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27; styles
# shows disdain for the often unquestioned value of structural unity
# questions the mutual exclusivity of elitist and populist values
# avoids totalizing forms (e.g., does not want entire pieces to be tonal or serial or cast in a prescribed formal mold)
# considers music not as autonomous but as relevant to cultural, social, and political contexts
# includes quotations of or references to music of many traditions and cultures
# considers technology not only as a way to preserve and transmit music but also as deeply implicated in the production and essence of music
# embraces contradictions
# distrusts binary oppositions
# includes fragmentations and discontinuities
# encompasses pluralism and eclecticism
# presents multiple meanings and multiple temporalities
# locates meaning and even structure in listeners, more than in scores, performances, or composers

Daniel Albright summarizes the main tendencies of musical postmodernism as:
#Bricolage
#Polystylism
#Randomness

==Timescale==
One author has suggested that the emergence of postmodern music in popular music occurred in the late 1960s, influenced in part by psychedelic rock and one or more of the later Beatles albums. Beard and Gloag support this position, citing Jameson&#x27;s theory that &quot;the radical changes of musical styles and languages throughout the 1960s [are] now seen as a reflection of postmodernism&quot;. Others have placed the beginnings of postmodernism in the arts, with particular reference to music, at around 1930.

<text>A pump is a device that moves fluids (liquids or gases), or sometimes slurries, by mechanical action, typically converted from electrical energy into hydraulic or pneumatic energy.

Mechanical pumps serve in a wide range of applications such as pumping water from wells, aquarium filtering, pond filtering and aeration, in the car industry for water-cooling and fuel injection, in the energy industry for pumping oil and natural gas or for operating cooling towers and other components of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. In the medical industry, pumps are used for biochemical processes in developing and manufacturing medicine, and as artificial replacements for body parts, in particular the artificial heart and penile prosthesis.

When a pump contains two or more pump mechanisms with fluid being directed to flow through them in series, it is called a &quot;multi-stage pump&quot;. Terms such as &quot;two-stage&quot; or &quot;double-stage&quot; may be used to specifically describe the number of stages. A pump that does not fit this description is simply a &quot;single-stage pump&quot; in contrast.

In biology, many different types of chemical and biomechanical pumps have evolved; biomimicry is sometimes used in developing new types of mechanical pumps.
==Types==
Mechanical pumps may be submerged in the fluid they are pumping or be placed external to the fluid.

Pumps can be classified by their method of displacement into electromagnetic pumps, positive-displacement pumps, impulse pumps, velocity pumps, gravity pumps, steam pumps and valveless pumps. There are three basic types of pumps: positive-displacement, centrifugal and axial-flow pumps. In centrifugal pumps the direction of flow of the fluid changes by ninety degrees as it flows over an impeller, while in axial flow pumps the direction of flow is unchanged.

===Electromagnetic pump===
=== Positive-displacement pumps ===


A positive-displacement pump makes a fluid move by trapping a fixed amount and forcing (displacing) that trapped volume into the discharge pipe.

Some positive-displacement pumps use an expanding cavity on the suction side and a decreasing cavity on the discharge side. Liquid flows into the pump as the cavity on the suction side expands and the liquid flows out of the discharge as the cavity collapses. The volume is constant through each cycle of operation.

==== Positive-displacement pump behavior and safety ====
Positive-displacement pumps, unlike centrifugal, can theoretically produce the same flow at a given rotational speed no matter what the discharge pressure. Thus, positive-displacement pumps are &quot;constant flow machines&quot;. However, a slight increase in internal leakage as the pressure increases prevents a truly constant flow rate.

A positive-displacement pump must not operate against a closed valve on the discharge side of the pump, because it has no shutoff head like centrifugal pumps. A positive-displacement pump operating against a closed discharge valve continues to produce flow and the pressure in the discharge line increases until the line bursts, the pump is severely damaged, or both.

A relief or safety valve on the discharge side of the positive-displacement pump is therefore necessary. The relief valve can be internal or external. The pump manufacturer normally has the option to supply internal relief or safety valves. The internal valve is usually used only as a safety precaution. An external relief valve in the discharge line, with a return line back to the suction line or supply tank, provides increased safety.

==== Positive-displacement types ====
A positive-displacement pump can be further classified according to the mechanism used to move the fluid:

* &quot;Rotary-type&quot; positive displacement: internal and external gear pump, screw pump, lobe pump, shuttle block, flexible vane and sliding vane, circumferential piston, flexible impeller, helical twisted roots (e.g. the Wendelkolben pump) and liquid-ring pumps
* &quot;Reciprocating-type&quot; positive displacement: piston pumps, plunger pumps and diaphragm pumps
* &quot;Linear-type&quot; positive displacement: rope pumps and chain pumps

===== Rotary positive-displacement pumps =====
These pumps move fluid using a rotating mechanism that creates a vacuum that captures and draws in the liquid.

&quot;Advantages:&quot; Rotary pumps are very efficient because they can handle highly viscous fluids with higher flow rates as viscosity increases.

&quot;Drawbacks:&quot; The nature of the pump requires very close clearances between the rotating pump and the outer edge, making it rotate at a slow, steady speed. If rotary pumps are operated at high speeds, the fluids cause erosion, which eventually causes enlarged clearances that liquid can pass through, which reduces efficiency.

Rotary positive-displacement pumps fall into five main types:
* Gear pumps – a simple type of rotary pump where the liquid is pushed around a pair of gears.
* Screw pumps – the shape of the internals of this pump is usually two screws turning against each other to pump the liquid
* Rotary vane pumps
* Hollow disc pumps (also known as eccentric disc pumps or hollow rotary disc pumps), similar to scroll compressors, these have an eccentric cylindrical rotor encased in a circular housing. As the rotor orbits, it traps fluid between the rotor and the casing, drawing the fluid through the pump. It is used for highly viscous fluids like petroleum-derived products, and it can also support high pressures of up to 290 psi.
* Peristaltic pumps have rollers which pinch a section of flexible tubing, forcing the liquid ahead as the rollers advance. Because they are very easy to keep clean, these are popular for dispensing food, medicine, and concrete.

===== Reciprocating positive-displacement pumps =====

Reciprocating pumps move the fluid using one or more oscillating pistons, plungers, or membranes (diaphragms), while valves restrict fluid motion to the desired direction. In order for suction to take place, the pump must first pull the plunger in an outward motion to decrease pressure in the chamber. Once the plunger pushes back, it will increase the chamber pressure and the inward pressure of the plunger will then open the discharge valve and release the fluid into the delivery pipe at constant flow rate and increased pressure.

Pumps in this category range from &quot;simplex&quot;, with one cylinder, to in some cases &quot;quad&quot; (four) cylinders, or more. Many reciprocating-type pumps are &quot;duplex&quot; (two) or &quot;triplex&quot; (three) cylinder. They can be either &quot;single-acting&quot; with suction during one direction of piston motion and discharge on the other, or &quot;double-acting&quot; with suction and discharge in both directions. The pumps can be powered manually, by air or steam, or by a belt driven by an engine. This type of pump was used extensively in the 19th century—in the early days of steam propulsion—as boiler feed water pumps. Now reciprocating pumps typically pump highly viscous fluids like concrete and heavy oils, and serve in special applications that demand low flow rates against high resistance. Reciprocating hand pumps were widely used to pump water from wells. Common bicycle pumps and foot pumps for inflation use reciprocating action.

These positive-displacement pumps have an expanding cavity on the suction side and a decreasing cavity on the discharge side. Liquid flows into the pumps as the cavity on the suction side expands and the liquid flows out of the discharge as the cavity collapses. The volume is constant given each cycle of operation and the pump&#x27;s volumetric efficiency can be achieved through routine maintenance and inspection of its valves.

Typical reciprocating pumps are:
* &quot;Plunger pump&quot; – a reciprocating plunger pushes the fluid through one or two open valves, closed by suction on the way back.
* &quot;Diaphragm pump&quot; – similar to plunger pumps, where the plunger pressurizes hydraulic oil which is used to flex a diaphragm in the pumping cylinder. Diaphragm valves are used to pump hazardous and toxic fluids.
* &quot;Piston pump&quot; displacement pumps&quot; – usually simple devices for pumping small amounts of liquid or gel manually. The common hand soap dispenser is such a pump.
* &quot;Radial piston pump&quot;a form of hydraulic pump where pistons extend in a radial direction.
* Vibratory pump or vibration pumpa particularly low-cost form of plunger pump, popular in low-cost espresso machines. The only moving part is a spring-loaded piston, the armature of a solenoid. Driven by half-wave rectified alternating current, the piston is forced forward while energized, and is retracted by the spring during the other half cycle. Due to their inefficiency, vibratory pumps typically cannot be operated for more than one minute without overheating, so are limited to intermittent duty.

=====Various positive-displacement pumps=====

The positive-displacement principle applies in these pumps:

* Rotary lobe pump
* Progressing cavity pump
* Rotary gear pump
* Piston pump
* Diaphragm pump
* Screw pump
* Gear pump
* Hydraulic pump
* Rotary vane pump
* Peristaltic pump
* Rope pump
* Flexible impeller pump

======Gear pump======

This is the simplest form of rotary positive-displacement pumps. It consists of two meshed gears that rotate in a closely fitted casing. The tooth spaces trap fluid and force it around the outer periphery. The fluid does not travel back on the meshed part, because the teeth mesh closely in the center. Gear pumps see wide use in car engine oil pumps and in various hydraulic power packs.

======Screw pump======

A screw pump is a more complicated type of rotary pump that uses two or three screws with opposing thread — e.g., one screw turns clockwise and the other counterclockwise. The screws are mounted on parallel shafts that often have gears that mesh so the shafts turn together and everything stays in place. In some cases the driven screw drives the secondary screw, without gears, often using the fluid to limit abrasion. The screws turn on the shafts and drive fluid through the pump. As with other forms of rotary pumps, the clearance between moving parts and the pump&#x27;s casing is minimal.
======Progressing cavity pump======


Widely used for pumping difficult materials, such as sewage sludge contaminated with large particles, a progressing cavity pump consists of a helical rotor, about ten times as long as its width. This can be visualized as a central core of diameter &quot;x&quot; with, typically, a curved spiral wound around of thickness half &quot;x&quot;, though in reality it is manufactured in a single casting. This shaft fits inside a heavy-duty rubber sleeve, of wall thickness also typically &quot;x&quot;. As the shaft rotates, the rotor gradually forces fluid up the rubber sleeve. Such pumps can develop very high pressure at low volumes.

======Roots-type pump======

Named after the Roots brothers who invented it, this lobe pump displaces the fluid trapped between two long helical rotors, each fitted into the other when perpendicular at 90°, rotating inside a triangular shaped sealing line configuration, both at the point of suction and at the point of discharge. This design produces a continuous flow with equal volume and no vortex. It can work at low pulsation rates, and offers gentle performance that some applications require.

Applications include:
* High capacity industrial air compressors.
* Roots superchargers on internal combustion engines.
* A brand of civil defense siren, the Federal Signal Corporation&#x27;s Thunderbolt.

======Peristaltic pump======

A &quot;peristaltic pump&quot; is a type of positive-displacement pump. It contains fluid within a flexible tube fitted inside a circular pump casing (though linear peristaltic pumps have been made). A number of &quot;rollers&quot;, &quot;shoes&quot;, or &quot;wipers&quot; attached to a rotor compress the flexible tube. As the rotor turns, the part of the tube under compression closes (or &quot;occludes&quot;), forcing the fluid through the tube. Additionally, when the tube opens to its natural state after the passing of the cam it draws (&quot;restitution&quot;) fluid into the pump. This process is called &quot;peristalsis&quot; and is used in many biological systems such as the gastrointestinal tract.
======Plunger pumps======
&quot;Plunger pumps&quot; are reciprocating positive-displacement pumps.

These consist of a cylinder with a reciprocating plunger. The suction and discharge valves are mounted in the head of the cylinder. In the suction stroke, the plunger retracts and the suction valves open causing suction of fluid into the cylinder. In the forward stroke, the plunger pushes the liquid out of the discharge valve.
Efficiency and common problems: With only one cylinder in plunger pumps, the fluid flow varies between maximum flow when the plunger moves through the middle positions, and zero flow when the plunger is at the end positions. A lot of energy is wasted when the fluid is accelerated in the piping system. Vibration and &quot;water hammer&quot; may be a serious problem. In general, the problems are compensated for by using two or more cylinders not working in phase with each other. Centrifugal pumps are also susceptible to water hammer. Surge analysis, a specialized study, helps evaluate this risk in such systems.

======Triplex-style plunger pump======
Triplex plunger pumps use three plungers, which reduces the pulsation relative to single reciprocating plunger pumps. Adding a pulsation dampener on the pump outlet can further smooth the &quot;pump ripple&quot;, or ripple graph of a pump transducer. The dynamic relationship of the high-pressure fluid and plunger generally requires high-quality plunger seals. Plunger pumps with a larger number of plungers have the benefit of increased flow, or smoother flow without a pulsation damper. The increase in moving parts and crankshaft load is one drawback.

Car washes often use these triplex-style plunger pumps (perhaps without pulsation dampers). In 1968, William Bruggeman reduced the size of the triplex pump and increased the lifespan so that car washes could use equipment with smaller footprints. Durable high-pressure seals, low-pressure seals and oil seals, hardened crankshafts, hardened connecting rods, thick ceramic plungers and heavier duty ball and roller bearings improve reliability in triplex pumps. Triplex pumps now are in a myriad of markets across the world.

Triplex pumps with shorter lifetimes are commonplace to the home user. A person who uses a home pressure washer for 10 hours a year may be satisfied with a pump that lasts 100 hours between rebuilds. Industrial-grade or continuous duty triplex pumps on the other end of the quality spectrum may run for as much as 2,080 hours a year.

The oil and gas drilling industry uses massive semi-trailer-transported triplex pumps called mud pumps to pump drilling mud, which cools the drill bit and carries the cuttings back to the surface.
Drillers use triplex or even quintuplex pumps to inject water and solvents deep into shale in the extraction process called &quot;fracking&quot;.

======Diaphragm pump======
Typically run on electricity compressed air, diaphragm pumps are relatively inexpensive and can perform a wide variety of duties, from pumping air into an aquarium, to liquids through a filter press. Double-diaphragm pumps can handle viscous fluids and abrasive materials with a gentle pumping process ideal for transporting shear-sensitive media.

======Rope pump======

Devised in China as chain pumps over 1000 years ago, these pumps can be made from very simple materials: A rope, a wheel and a pipe are sufficient to make a simple rope pump. Rope pump efficiency has been studied by grassroots organizations and the techniques for making and running them have been continuously improved.
===Impulse pump===
Impulse pumps use pressure created by gas (usually air). In some impulse pumps the gas trapped in the liquid (usually water), is released and accumulated somewhere in the pump, creating a pressure that can push part of the liquid upwards.

Conventional impulse pumps include:
* &quot;Hydraulic ram pumps&quot; – kinetic energy of a low-head water supply is stored temporarily in an air-bubble hydraulic accumulator, then used to drive water to a higher head.
* &quot;Pulser pumps&quot; – run with natural resources, by kinetic energy only.
* &quot;Airlift pumps&quot; – run on air inserted into pipe, which pushes the water up when bubbles move upward

Instead of a gas accumulation and releasing cycle, the pressure can be created by burning of hydrocarbons. Such combustion driven pumps directly transmit the impulse from a combustion event through the actuation membrane to the pump fluid. In order to allow this direct transmission, the pump needs to be almost entirely made of an elastomer (e.g. silicone rubber). Hence, the combustion causes the membrane to expand and thereby pumps the fluid out of the adjacent pumping chamber. The first combustion-driven soft pump was developed by ETH Zurich.

====Hydraulic ram pump====
A hydraulic ram is a water pump powered by hydropower.

It takes in water at relatively low pressure and high flow-rate and outputs water at a higher hydraulic-head and lower flow-rate. The device uses the water hammer effect to develop pressure that lifts a portion of the input water that powers the pump to a point higher than where the water started.

The hydraulic ram is sometimes used in remote areas, where there is both a source of low-head hydropower, and a need for pumping water to a destination higher in elevation than the source. In this situation, the ram is often useful, since it requires no outside source of power other than the kinetic energy of flowing water.

===Velocity pumps===
Rotodynamic pumps (or dynamic pumps) are a type of velocity pump in which kinetic energy is added to the fluid by increasing the flow velocity. This increase in energy is converted to a gain in potential energy (pressure) when the velocity is reduced prior to or as the flow exits the pump into the discharge pipe. This conversion of kinetic energy to pressure is explained by the &quot;First law of thermodynamics&quot;, or more specifically by &quot;Bernoulli&#x27;s principle&quot;.

Dynamic pumps can be further subdivided according to the means in which the velocity gain is achieved.

These types of pumps have a number of characteristics:
# Continuous energy
# Conversion of added energy to increase in kinetic energy (increase in velocity)
# Conversion of increased velocity (kinetic energy) to an increase in pressure head

A practical difference between dynamic and positive-displacement pumps is how they operate under closed valve conditions. Positive-displacement pumps physically displace fluid, so closing a valve downstream of a positive-displacement pump produces a continual pressure build up that can cause mechanical failure of pipeline or pump. Dynamic pumps differ in that they can be safely operated under closed valve conditions (for short periods of time).

====Radial-flow pump====
Such a pump is also referred to as a &quot;centrifugal pump&quot;. The fluid enters along the axis or center, is accelerated by the impeller and exits at right angles to the shaft (radially); an example is the centrifugal fan, which is commonly used to implement a vacuum cleaner. Another type of radial-flow pump is a vortex pump. The liquid in them moves in tangential direction around the working wheel. The conversion from the mechanical energy of motor into the potential energy of flow comes by means of multiple whirls, which are excited by the impeller in the working channel of the pump. Generally, a radial-flow pump operates at higher pressures and lower flow rates than an axial- or a mixed-flow pump.

====Axial-flow pump====
These are also referred to as &quot;all-fluid pumps&quot;. The fluid is pushed outward or inward to move fluid axially. They operate at much lower pressures and higher flow rates than radial-flow (centrifugal) pumps. Axial-flow pumps cannot be run up to speed without special precaution. If at a low flow rate, the total head rise and high torque associated with this pipe would mean that the starting torque would have to become a function of acceleration for the whole mass of liquid in the pipe system.

Mixed-flow pumps function as a compromise between radial and axial-flow pumps. The fluid experiences both radial acceleration and lift and exits the impeller somewhere between 0 and 90 degrees from the axial direction. As a consequence mixed-flow pumps operate at higher pressures than axial-flow pumps while delivering higher discharges than radial-flow pumps. The exit angle of the flow dictates the pressure head-discharge characteristic in relation to radial and mixed-flow.

====Regenerative turbine pump ====
Also known as drag, friction, liquid-ring pump, peripheral, traction, turbulence, or vortex pumps, regenerative turbine pumps are a class of rotodynamic pump that operates at high head pressures, typically .

The pump has an impeller with a number of vanes or paddles which spins in a cavity. The suction port and pressure ports are located at the perimeter of the cavity and are isolated by a barrier called a stripper, which allows only the tip channel (fluid between the blades) to recirculate, and forces any fluid in the side channel (fluid in the cavity outside of the blades) through the pressure port. In a regenerative turbine pump, as fluid spirals repeatedly from a vane into the side channel and back to the next vane, kinetic energy is imparted to the periphery, thus pressure builds with each spiral, in a manner similar to a regenerative blower.

As regenerative turbine pumps cannot become vapor locked, they are commonly applied to volatile, hot, or cryogenic fluid transport. However, as tolerances are typically tight, they are vulnerable to solids or particles causing jamming or rapid wear. Efficiency is typically low, and pressure and power consumption typically decrease with flow. Additionally, pumping direction can be reversed by reversing direction of spin.

====Side-channel pump====
A side-channel pump has a suction disk, an impeller, and a discharge disk.

====Eductor-jet pump====
This uses a jet, often of steam, to create a low pressure. This low pressure sucks in fluid and propels it into a higher-pressure region.

===Gravity pumps===
Gravity pumps include the &quot;syphon&quot; and &quot;Heron&#x27;s fountain&quot;. The &quot;hydraulic ram&quot; is also sometimes called a gravity pump. In a gravity pump the fluid is lifted by gravitational force.

===Steam pump===
Steam pumps have been for a long time mainly of historical interest. They include any type of pump powered by a steam engine and also pistonless pumps such as Thomas Savery&#x27;s or the Pulsometer steam pump.

Recently there has been a resurgence of interest in low-power solar steam pumps for use in smallholder irrigation in developing countries. Previously small steam engines have not been viable because of escalating inefficiencies as vapour engines decrease in size. However the use of modern engineering materials coupled with alternative engine configurations has meant that these types of system are now a cost-effective opportunity.

===Valveless pumps===
Valveless pumping assists in fluid transport in various biomedical and engineering systems. In a valveless pumping system, no valves (or physical occlusions) are present to regulate the flow direction. The fluid pumping efficiency of a valveless system, however, is not necessarily lower than that having valves. In fact, many fluid-dynamical systems in nature and engineering more or less rely upon valveless pumping to transport the working fluids therein. For instance, blood circulation in the cardiovascular system is maintained to some extent even when the heart&#x27;s valves fail. Meanwhile, the embryonic vertebrate heart begins pumping blood long before the development of discernible chambers and valves. Similar to blood circulation in one direction, bird respiratory systems pump air in one direction in rigid lungs, but without any physiological valve. In microfluidics, valveless impedance pumps have been fabricated, and are expected to be particularly suitable for handling sensitive biofluids. Ink jet printers operating on the piezoelectric transducer principle also use valveless pumping. The pump chamber is emptied through the printing jet due to reduced flow impedance in that direction and refilled by capillary action.

==Pump repairs==

Examining pump repair records and mean time between failures (MTBF) is of great importance to responsible and conscientious pump users. In view of that fact, the preface to the 2006 Pump User&#x27;s Handbook alludes to &quot;pump failure&quot; statistics. For the sake of convenience, these failure statistics often are translated into MTBF (in this case, installed life before failure).

In early 2005, Gordon Buck, John Crane Inc.&#x27;s chief engineer for field operations in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, examined the repair records for a number of refinery and chemical plants to obtain meaningful reliability data for centrifugal pumps. A total of 15 operating plants having nearly 15,000 pumps were included in the survey. The smallest of these plants had about 100 pumps; several plants had over 2000. All facilities were located in the United States. In addition, considered as &quot;new&quot;, others as &quot;renewed&quot; and still others as &quot;established&quot;. Many of these plants—but not all—had an alliance arrangement with John Crane. In some cases, the alliance contract included having a John Crane Inc. technician or engineer on-site to coordinate various aspects of the program.

Not all plants are refineries, however, and different results occur elsewhere. In chemical plants, pumps have historically been &quot;throw-away&quot; items as chemical attack limits life. Things have improved in recent years, but the somewhat restricted space available in &quot;old&quot; DIN and ASME-standardized stuffing boxes places limits on the type of seal that fits. Unless the pump user upgrades the seal chamber, the pump only accommodates more compact and simple versions. Without this upgrading, lifetimes in chemical installations are generally around 50 to 60 percent of the refinery values.

Unscheduled maintenance is often one of the most significant costs of ownership, and failures of mechanical seals and bearings are among the major causes. Keep in mind the potential value of selecting pumps that cost more initially, but last much longer between repairs. The MTBF of a better pump may be one to four years longer than that of its non-upgraded counterpart. Consider that published average values of avoided pump failures range from US$2600 to US$12,000. This does not include lost opportunity costs. One pump fire occurs per 1000 failures. Having fewer pump failures means having fewer destructive pump fires.

As has been noted, a typical pump failure, based on actual year 2002 reports, costs US$5,000 on average. This includes costs for material, parts, labor and overhead. Extending a pump&#x27;s MTBF from 12 to 18 months would save US$1,667 per year — which might be greater than the cost to upgrade the centrifugal pump&#x27;s reliability.

==Applications==
Pumps are used throughout society for a variety of purposes. Early applications includes the use of the windmill or watermill to pump water. Today, the pump is used for irrigation, water supply, gasoline supply, air conditioning systems, refrigeration (usually called a compressor), chemical movement, sewage movement, flood control, marine services, etc.

Because of the wide variety of applications, pumps have a plethora of shapes and sizes: from very large to very small, from handling gas to handling liquid, from high pressure to low pressure, and from high volume to low volume.

===Priming a pump===
Typically, a liquid pump cannot simply draw air. The feed line of the pump and the internal body surrounding the pumping mechanism must first be filled with the liquid that requires pumping: An operator must introduce liquid into the system to initiate the pumping, known as &quot;priming&quot; the pump. Loss of prime is usually due to ingestion of air into the pump, or evaporation of the working fluid if the pump is used infrequently. Clearances and displacement ratios in pumps for liquids are insufficient for pumping compressible gas, so air or other gasses in the pump can not be evacuated by the pump&#x27;s action alone. This is the case with most velocity (rotodynamic) pumps — for example, centrifugal pumps. For such pumps, the position of the pump and intake tubing should be lower than the suction point so it is primed by gravity; otherwise the pump should be manually filled with liquid or a secondary pump should be used until all air is removed from the suction line and the pump casing. Liquid ring pumps have a dedicated intake for the priming liquid separate from the intake of the fluid being pumped, as the fluid being pumped may be a gas or mix of gas, liquid, and solids. For these pumps the priming liquid intake must be supplied continuously (either by gravity or pressure), however the intake for the fluid being pumped is capable of drawing a vacuum equivalent to the boiling point of the priming liquid.

Positive–displacement pumps, however, tend to have sufficiently tight sealing between the moving parts and the casing or housing of the pump that they can be described as &quot;self-priming&quot;. Such pumps can also serve as &quot;priming pumps&quot;, so-called when they are used to fulfill that need for other pumps in lieu of action taken by a human operator.

===Pumps as public water supplies===

One sort of pump once common worldwide was a hand-powered water pump, or &#x27;pitcher pump&#x27;. It was commonly installed over community water wells in the days before piped water supplies.

In parts of the British Isles, it was often called &quot;the parish pump&quot;. Though such community pumps are no longer common, people still used the expression &quot;parish pump&quot; to describe a place or forum where matters of local interest are discussed.

Because water from pitcher pumps is drawn directly from the soil, it is more prone to contamination. If such water is not filtered and purified, consumption of it might lead to gastrointestinal or other water-borne diseases. A notorious case is the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. At the time it was not known how cholera was transmitted, but physician John Snow suspected contaminated water and had the handle of the public pump he suspected removed; the outbreak then subsided.

Modern hand-operated community pumps are considered the most sustainable low-cost option for safe water supply in resource-poor settings, often in rural areas in developing countries. A hand pump opens access to deeper groundwater that is often not polluted and also improves the safety of a well by protecting the water source from contaminated buckets. Pumps such as the Afridev pump are designed to be cheap to build and install, and easy to maintain with simple parts. However, scarcity of spare parts for these type of pumps in some regions of Africa has diminished their utility for these areas.

===Sealing multiphase pumping applications===
Multiphase pumping applications, also referred to as tri-phase, have grown due to increased oil drilling activity. In addition, the economics of multiphase production is attractive to upstream operations as it leads to simpler, smaller in-field installations, reduced equipment costs and improved production rates. In essence, the multiphase pump can accommodate all fluid stream properties with one piece of equipment, which has a smaller footprint. Often, two smaller multiphase pumps are installed in series rather than having just one massive pump.
==== Types and features of multiphase pumps ====

=====Helico-axial (centrifugal)=====
A rotodynamic pump with one single shaft that requires two mechanical seals, this pump uses an open-type axial impeller. It is often called a &quot;Poseidon pump&quot;, and can be described as a cross between an axial compressor and a centrifugal pump.

=====Twin-screw (positive-displacement)=====
The twin-screw pump is constructed of two inter-meshing screws that move the pumped fluid. Twin screw pumps are often used when pumping conditions contain high gas volume fractions and fluctuating inlet conditions. Four mechanical seals are required to seal the two shafts.

=====Progressive cavity (positive-displacement)=====
When the pumping application is not suited to a centrifugal pump, a progressive cavity pump is used instead. Progressive cavity pumps are single-screw types typically used in shallow wells or at the surface. This pump is mainly used on surface applications where the pumped fluid may contain a considerable amount of solids such as sand and dirt. The volumetric efficiency and mechanical efficiency of a progressive cavity pump increases as the viscosity of the liquid does.

=====Electric submersible (centrifugal)=====
These pumps are basically multistage centrifugal pumps and are widely used in oil well applications as a method for artificial lift. These pumps are usually specified when the pumped fluid is mainly liquid.

&quot;Buffer tank&quot;
A buffer tank is often installed upstream of the pump suction nozzle in case of a slug flow. The buffer tank breaks the energy of the liquid slug, smooths any fluctuations in the incoming flow and acts as a sand trap.

As the name indicates, multiphase pumps and their mechanical seals can encounter a large variation in service conditions such as changing process fluid composition, temperature variations, high and low operating pressures and exposure to abrasive/erosive media. The challenge is selecting the appropriate mechanical seal arrangement and support system to ensure maximized seal life and its overall effectiveness.

==Specifications==
Pumps are commonly rated by horsepower, volumetric flow rate, outlet pressure in metres (or feet) of head, inlet suction in suction feet (or metres) of head.
The head can be simplified as the number of feet or metres the pump can raise or lower a column of water at atmospheric pressure.

From an initial design point of view, engineers often use a quantity termed the specific speed to identify the most suitable pump type for a particular combination of flow rate and head.
Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) is crucial for pump performance. It has two key aspects:
1) NPSHr (Required): The Head required for the pump to operate without cavitation issues.
2) NPSHa (Available): The actual pressure provided by the system (e.g., from an overhead tank).
For optimal pump operation, NPSHa must always exceed NPSHr. This ensures the pump has enough pressure to prevent cavitation, a damaging condition.

==Pumping power==

The power imparted into a fluid increases the energy of the fluid per unit volume. Thus the power relationship is between the conversion of the mechanical energy of the pump mechanism and the fluid elements within the pump. In general, this is governed by a series of simultaneous differential equations, known as the Navier–Stokes equations. However a more simple equation relating only the different energies in the fluid, known as Bernoulli&#x27;s equation can be used. Hence the power, P, required by the pump:
: formula_1

where Δp is the change in total pressure between the inlet and outlet (in Pa), and Q, the volume flow-rate of the fluid is given in m3/s. The total pressure may have gravitational, static pressure and kinetic energy components; i.e. energy is distributed between change in the fluid&#x27;s gravitational potential energy (going up or down hill), change in velocity, or change in static pressure. η is the pump efficiency, and may be given by the manufacturer&#x27;s information, such as in the form of a pump curve, and is typically derived from either fluid dynamics simulation (i.e. solutions to the Navier–Stokes for the particular pump geometry), or by testing. The efficiency of the pump depends upon the pump&#x27;s configuration and operating conditions (such as rotational speed, fluid density and viscosity etc.)
: formula_2

For a typical &quot;pumping&quot; configuration, the work is imparted on the fluid, and is thus positive. For the fluid imparting the work on the pump (i.e. a turbine), the work is negative. Power required to drive the pump is determined by dividing the output power by the pump efficiency. Furthermore, this definition encompasses pumps with no moving parts, such as a siphon.

==Efficiency==
Pump efficiency is defined as the ratio of the power imparted on the fluid by the pump in relation to the power supplied to drive the pump. Its value is not fixed for a given pump, efficiency is a function of the discharge and therefore also operating head. For centrifugal pumps, the efficiency tends to increase with flow rate up to a point midway through the operating range (peak efficiency or Best Efficiency Point (BEP) ) and then declines as flow rates rise further. Pump performance data such as this is usually supplied by the manufacturer before pump selection. Pump efficiencies tend to decline over time due to wear (e.g. increasing clearances as impellers reduce in size).

When a system includes a centrifugal pump, an important design issue is matching the &quot;head loss-flow characteristic&quot; with the pump so that it operates at or close to the point of its maximum efficiency.

Pump efficiency is an important aspect and pumps should be regularly tested. Thermodynamic pump testing is one method.

== Minimum flow protection ==
Most large pumps have a minimum flow requirement below which the pump may be damaged by overheating, impeller wear, vibration, seal failure, drive shaft damage or poor performance. A minimum flow protection system ensures that the pump is not operated below the minimum flow rate. The system protects the pump even if it is shut-in or dead-headed, that is, if the discharge line is completely closed.

The simplest minimum flow system is a pipe running from the pump discharge line back to the suction line. This line is fitted with an orifice plate sized to allow the pump minimum flow to pass. The arrangement ensures that the minimum flow is maintained, although it is wasteful as it recycles fluid even when the flow through the pump exceeds the minimum flow.

A more sophisticated, but more costly, system (see diagram) comprises a flow measuring device (FE) in the pump discharge which provides a signal into a flow controller (FIC) which actuates a flow control valve (FCV) in the recycle line. If the measured flow exceeds the minimum flow then the FCV is closed. If the measured flow falls below the minimum flow the FCV opens to maintain the minimum flowrate.

As the fluids are recycled the kinetic energy of the pump increases the temperature of the fluid. For many pumps this added heat energy is dissipated through the pipework. However, for large industrial pumps, such as oil pipeline pumps, a recycle cooler is provided in the recycle line to cool the fluids to the normal suction temperature. Alternatively the recycled fluids may be returned to upstream of the export cooler in an oil refinery, oil terminal, or offshore installation.

<text>Pressure (symbol: &quot;p&quot; or &quot;P&quot;) is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed. Gauge pressure (also spelled &quot;gage&quot; pressure) is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure.

Various units are used to express pressure. Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area; the SI unit of pressure, the pascal (Pa), for example, is one newton per square metre (N/m2); similarly, the pound-force per square inch (psi, symbol lbf/in2) is the traditional unit of pressure in the imperial and US customary systems. Pressure may also be expressed in terms of standard atmospheric pressure; the unit atmosphere (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the torr is defined as of this. Manometric units such as the centimetre of water, millimetre of mercury, and inch of mercury are used to express pressures in terms of the height of column of a particular fluid in a manometer.

==Definition==
&quot;Pressure&quot; is the amount of force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area. The symbol for it is &quot;p&quot; or &quot;P&quot;.
The IUPAC recommendation for pressure is a lower-case &quot;p&quot;.
However, upper-case &quot;P&quot; is widely used. The usage of &quot;P&quot; vs &quot;p&quot; depends upon the field in which one is working, on the nearby presence of other symbols for quantities such as power and momentum, and on writing style.

===Formula===
Mathematically:
formula_1
where:
*formula_2 is the pressure,
*formula_3 is the magnitude of the normal force,
*formula_4 is the area of the surface on contact.

Pressure is a scalar quantity. It relates the vector area element (a vector normal to the surface) with the normal force acting on it. The pressure is the scalar proportionality constant that relates these two normal vectors:
formula_5

The minus sign comes from the convention that the force is considered towards the surface element, while the normal vector points outward. The equation has meaning in that, for any surface &quot;S&quot; in contact with the fluid, the total force exerted by the fluid on that surface is the surface integral over &quot;S&quot; of the right-hand side of the above equation.

It is incorrect (although rather usual) to say &quot;the pressure is directed in such or such direction&quot;. The pressure, as a scalar, has no direction. The force given by the previous relationship to the quantity has a direction, but the pressure does not. If we change the orientation of the surface element, the direction of the normal force changes accordingly, but the pressure remains the same.

Pressure is distributed to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid &quot;normal to&quot; these boundaries or sections at every point. It is a fundamental parameter in thermodynamics, and it is conjugate to volume. It is defined as a derivative of the internal energy of a system:
:formula_6
where:
*formula_7 is the internal energy,
*formula_8 is the volume of the system,
*The subscripts mean that the derivative is taken at fixed entropy (formula_9) and particle number (formula_10).

===Units===

The SI unit for pressure is the pascal (Pa), equal to one newton per square metre (N/m2, or kg·m−1·s−2). This name for the unit was added in 1971; before that, pressure in SI was expressed in newtons per square metre.

Other units of pressure, such as pounds per square inch (lbf/in2) and bar, are also in common use. The CGS unit of pressure is the barye (Ba), equal to 1 dyn·cm−2, or 0.1 Pa. Pressure is sometimes expressed in grams-force or kilograms-force per square centimetre (&quot;g/cm2&quot; or &quot;kg/cm2&quot;) and the like without properly identifying the force units. But using the names kilogram, gram, kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as units of force is deprecated in SI. The technical atmosphere (symbol: at) is 1 kgf/cm2 (98.0665 kPa, or 14.223 psi).

Pressure is related to energy density and may be expressed in units such as joules per cubic metre (J/m3, which is equal to Pa).
Mathematically:
formula_11

Some meteorologists prefer the hectopascal (hPa) for atmospheric air pressure, which is equivalent to the older unit millibar (mbar). Similar pressures are given in kilopascals (kPa) in most other fields, except aviation where the hecto- prefix is commonly used. The inch of mercury is still used in the United States. Oceanographers usually measure underwater pressure in decibars (dbar) because pressure in the ocean increases by approximately one decibar per metre depth.

The standard atmosphere (atm) is an established constant. It is approximately equal to typical air pressure at Earth mean sea level and is defined as (Note: IUPAC recommends the value , but prior to 1982 the value (= 1 atm) was usually used.

Because pressure is commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (e.g., centimetres of water, millimetres of mercury or inches of mercury). The most common choices are mercury (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury&#x27;s high density allows a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to be used to measure a given pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of liquid of height &quot;h&quot; and density &quot;ρ&quot; is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation , where &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration. Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely.

When millimetres of mercury (or inches of mercury) are quoted today, these units are not based on a physical column of mercury; rather, they have been given precise definitions that can be expressed in terms of SI units. One millimetre of mercury is approximately equal to one torr. The water-based units still depend on the density of water, a measured, rather than defined, quantity. These &quot;manometric units&quot; are still encountered in many fields. Blood pressure is measured in millimetres (or centimetres) of mercury in most of the world, and lung pressures in centimetres of water are still common.

Underwater divers use the metre sea water (msw or MSW) and foot sea water (fsw or FSW) units of pressure, and these are the units for pressure gauges used to measure pressure exposure in diving chambers and personal decompression computers. A msw is defined as 0.1 bar (= 10,000 Pa), is not the same as a linear metre of depth. 33.066 fsw = 1 atm (1 atm = 101,325 Pa / 33.066 = 3,064.326 Pa). The pressure conversion from msw to fsw is different from the length conversion: 10 msw = 32.6336 fsw, while 10 m = 32.8083 ft.

Gauge pressure is often given in units with &quot;g&quot; appended, e.g. &quot;kPag&quot;, &quot;barg&quot; or &quot;psig&quot;, and units for measurements of absolute pressure are sometimes given a suffix of &quot;a&quot;, to avoid confusion, for example &quot;kPaa&quot;, &quot;psia&quot;. However, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends that, to avoid confusion, any modifiers be instead applied to the quantity being measured rather than the unit of measure. For example, rather than .

Differential pressure is expressed in units with &quot;d&quot; appended; this type of measurement is useful when considering sealing performance or whether a valve will open or close.

Presently or formerly popular pressure units include the following:
*atmosphere (atm)
*manometric units:
**centimetre, inch, millimetre (torr) and micrometre (mTorr, micron) of mercury,
**height of equivalent column of water, including millimetre (mm ), centimetre (cm ), metre, inch, and foot of water;
*imperial and customary units:
**kip, short ton-force, long ton-force, pound-force, ounce-force, and poundal per square inch,
**short ton-force and long ton-force per square inch,
**fsw (feet sea water) used in underwater diving, particularly in connection with diving pressure exposure and decompression;
*non-SI metric units:
**bar, decibar, millibar,
***msw (metres sea water), used in underwater diving, particularly in connection with diving pressure exposure and decompression,
**kilogram-force, or kilopond, per square centimetre (technical atmosphere),
**gram-force and tonne-force (metric ton-force) per square centimetre,
**barye (dyne per square centimetre),
**kilogram-force and tonne-force per square metre,
**sthene per square metre (pieze).
===Examples===

As an example of varying pressures, a finger can be pressed against a wall without making any lasting impression; however, the same finger pushing a thumbtack can easily damage the wall. Although the force applied to the surface is the same, the thumbtack applies more pressure because the point concentrates that force into a smaller area. Pressure is transmitted to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid &quot;normal to&quot; these boundaries or sections at every point. Unlike stress, pressure is defined as a scalar quantity. The negative gradient of pressure is called the force density.

Another example is a knife. If the flat edge is used, force is distributed over a larger surface area resulting in less pressure, and it will not cut. Whereas using the sharp edge, which has less surface area, results in greater pressure, and so the knife cuts smoothly. This is one example of a practical application of pressure.

For gases, pressure is sometimes measured not as an &quot;absolute pressure&quot;, but relative to atmospheric pressure; such measurements are called &quot;gauge pressure&quot;. An example of this is the air pressure in an automobile tire, which might be said to be &quot;&quot;, but is actually 220 kPa (32 psi) above atmospheric pressure. Since atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 100 kPa (14.7 psi), the absolute pressure in the tire is therefore about . In technical work, this is written &quot;a gauge pressure of &quot;.

Where space is limited, such as on pressure gauges, name plates, graph labels, and table headings, the use of a modifier in parentheses, such as &quot;kPa (gauge)&quot; or &quot;kPa (absolute)&quot;, is permitted. In non-SI technical work, a gauge pressure of is sometimes written as &quot;32 psig&quot;, and an absolute pressure as &quot;32 psia&quot;, though the other methods explained above that avoid attaching characters to the unit of pressure are preferred.

Gauge pressure is the relevant measure of pressure wherever one is interested in the stress on storage vessels and the plumbing components of fluidics systems. However, whenever equation-of-state properties, such as densities or changes in densities, must be calculated, pressures must be expressed in terms of their absolute values. For instance, if the atmospheric pressure is , a gas (such as helium) at (gauge) ( [absolute]) is 50% denser than the same gas at (gauge) ( [absolute]). Focusing on gauge values, one might erroneously conclude the first sample had twice the density of the second one.

===Scalar nature===
In a static gas, the gas as a whole does not appear to move. The individual molecules of the gas, however, are in constant random motion. Because there are an extremely large number of molecules and because the motion of the individual molecules is random in every direction, no motion is detected. When the gas is at least partially confined (that is, not free to expand rapidly), the gas will exhibit a hydrostatic pressure. This confinement can be achieved with either a physical container of some sort, or in a gravitational well such as a planet, otherwise known as &quot;atmospheric pressure&quot;.

In the case of planetary atmospheres, the pressure-gradient force of the gas pushing outwards from higher pressure, lower altitudes to lower pressure, higher altitudes is balanced by the gravitational force, preventing the gas from diffusing into outer space and maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium.

In a physical container, the pressure of the gas originates from the molecules colliding with the walls of the container. The walls of the container can be anywhere inside the gas, and the force per unit area (the pressure) is the same. If the &quot;container&quot; is shrunk down to a very small point (becoming less true as the atomic scale is approached), the pressure will still have a single value at that point. Therefore, pressure is a scalar quantity, not a vector quantity. It has magnitude but no direction sense associated with it. Pressure force acts in all directions at a point inside a gas. At the surface of a gas, the pressure force acts perpendicular (at right angle) to the surface.

A closely related quantity is the stress tensor &quot;σ&quot;, which relates the vector force formula_12 to the 
vector area formula_13 via the linear relation formula_14.

This tensor may be expressed as the sum of the viscous stress tensor minus the hydrostatic pressure. The negative of the stress tensor is sometimes called the pressure tensor, but in the following, the term &quot;pressure&quot; will refer only to the scalar pressure.

According to the theory of general relativity, pressure increases the strength of a gravitational field (see stress–energy tensor) and so adds to the mass-energy cause of gravity. This effect is unnoticeable at everyday pressures but is significant in neutron stars, although it has not been experimentally tested.

==Types==

===Fluid pressure===
&quot;Fluid pressure&quot; is most often the compressive stress at some point within a fluid. (The term &quot;fluid&quot; refers to both liquids and gases – for more information specifically about liquid pressure, see section below.)

Fluid pressure occurs in one of two situations:
* An open condition, called &quot;open channel flow&quot;, e.g. the ocean, a swimming pool, or the atmosphere.
* A closed condition, called &quot;closed conduit&quot;, e.g. a water line or gas line.

Pressure in open conditions usually can be approximated as the pressure in &quot;static&quot; or non-moving conditions (even in the ocean where there are waves and currents), because the motions create only negligible changes in the pressure. Such conditions conform with principles of fluid statics. The pressure at any given point of a non-moving (static) fluid is called the &quot;hydrostatic pressure&quot;.

Closed bodies of fluid are either &quot;static&quot;, when the fluid is not moving, or &quot;dynamic&quot;, when the fluid can move as in either a pipe or by compressing an air gap in a closed container. The pressure in closed conditions conforms with the principles of fluid dynamics.

The concepts of fluid pressure are predominantly attributed to the discoveries of Blaise Pascal and Daniel Bernoulli. Bernoulli&#x27;s equation can be used in almost any situation to determine the pressure at any point in a fluid. The equation makes some assumptions about the fluid, such as the fluid being ideal and incompressible. An ideal fluid is a fluid in which there is no friction, it is inviscid (zero viscosity). The equation for all points of a system filled with a constant-density fluid is
formula_15

where:
*&quot;p&quot;, pressure of the fluid,
*&quot;formula_16&quot; = &quot;ρg&quot;, density × acceleration of gravity is the (volume-) specific weight of the fluid,
*&quot;v&quot;, velocity of the fluid,
*&quot;g&quot;, acceleration of gravity,
*&quot;z&quot;, elevation,
*formula_17, pressure head,
*formula_18, velocity head.

====Applications====
* Hydraulic brakes
* Artesian well
* Blood pressure
* Hydraulic head
* Plant cell turgidity
* Pythagorean cup
* Pressure washing

===Explosion or deflagration pressures===
Explosion or deflagration pressures are the result of the ignition of explosive gases, mists, dust/air suspensions, in unconfined and confined spaces.

=== Negative pressures ===

While &quot;pressures&quot; are, in general, positive, there are several situations in which negative pressures may be encountered:
*When dealing in relative (gauge) pressures. For instance, an absolute pressure of 80 kPa may be described as a gauge pressure of −21 kPa (i.e., 21 kPa below an atmospheric pressure of 101 kPa). For example, abdominal decompression is an obstetric procedure during which negative gauge pressure is applied intermittently to a pregnant woman&#x27;s abdomen.
*Negative absolute pressures are possible. They are effectively tension, and both bulk solids and bulk liquids can be put under negative absolute pressure by pulling on them. Microscopically, the molecules in solids and liquids have attractive interactions that overpower the thermal kinetic energy, so some tension can be sustained. Thermodynamically, however, a bulk material under negative pressure is in a metastable state, and it is especially fragile in the case of liquids where the negative pressure state is similar to superheating and is easily susceptible to cavitation. In certain situations, the cavitation can be avoided and negative pressures sustained indefinitely, for example, liquid mercury has been observed to sustain up to in clean glass containers. Negative liquid pressures are thought to be involved in the ascent of sap in plants taller than 10 m (the atmospheric pressure head of water).
*The Casimir effect can create a small attractive force due to interactions with vacuum energy; this force is sometimes termed &quot;vacuum pressure&quot; (not to be confused with the negative &quot;gauge pressure&quot; of a vacuum).
*For non-isotropic stresses in rigid bodies, depending on how the orientation of a surface is chosen, the same distribution of forces may have a component of positive stress along one surface normal, with a component of negative stress acting along another surface normal. The pressure is then defined as the average of the three principal stresses.
**The stresses in an electromagnetic field are generally non-isotropic, with the stress normal to one surface element (the normal stress) being negative, and positive for surface elements perpendicular to this.
*In cosmology, dark energy creates a very small yet cosmically significant amount of negative pressure, which accelerates the expansion of the universe.

===Stagnation pressure===

Stagnation pressure is the pressure a fluid exerts when it is forced to stop moving. Consequently, although a fluid moving at higher speed will have a lower static pressure, it may have a higher stagnation pressure when forced to a standstill. Static pressure and stagnation pressure are related by:
formula_19
where 
*formula_20 is the stagnation pressure,
*formula_21 is the density,
*formula_22 is the flow velocity,
*formula_2 is the static pressure.

The pressure of a moving fluid can be measured using a Pitot tube, or one of its variations such as a Kiel probe or Cobra probe, connected to a manometer. Depending on where the inlet holes are located on the probe, it can measure static pressures or stagnation pressures.

===Surface pressure and surface tension===
There is a two-dimensional analog of pressure – the lateral force per unit length applied on a line perpendicular to the force.

Surface pressure is denoted by π:
formula_24
and shares many similar properties with three-dimensional pressure. Properties of surface chemicals can be investigated by measuring pressure/area isotherms, as the two-dimensional analog of Boyle&#x27;s law, , at constant temperature.

Surface tension is another example of surface pressure, but with a reversed sign, because &quot;tension&quot; is the opposite to &quot;pressure&quot;.

=== Pressure of an ideal gas ===

In an ideal gas, molecules have no volume and do not interact. According to the ideal gas law, pressure varies linearly with temperature and quantity, and inversely with volume:
formula_25
where:
*&quot;p&quot; is the absolute pressure of the gas,
*&quot;n&quot; is the amount of substance,
*&quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature,
*&quot;V&quot; is the volume,
*&quot;R&quot; is the ideal gas constant.

Real gases exhibit a more complex dependence on the variables of state.

===Vapour pressure===

Vapour pressure is the pressure of a vapour in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases in a closed system. All liquids and solids have a tendency to evaporate into a gaseous form, and all gases have a tendency to condense back to their liquid or solid form.

The atmospheric pressure boiling point of a liquid (also known as the normal boiling point) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and lift the liquid to form vapour bubbles inside the bulk of the substance. Bubble formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher pressure, and therefore higher temperature, because the fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases.

The vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called partial vapor pressure.

===Liquid pressure===
When a person swims under the water, water pressure is felt acting on the person&#x27;s eardrums. The deeper that person swims, the greater the pressure. The pressure felt is due to the weight of the water above the person. As someone swims deeper, there is more water above the person and therefore greater pressure. The pressure a liquid exerts depends on its depth.

Liquid pressure also depends on the density of the liquid. If someone was submerged in a liquid more dense than water, the pressure would be correspondingly greater. Thus, we can say that the depth, density and liquid pressure are directly proportionate. The pressure due to a liquid in liquid columns of constant density and gravity at a depth within a substance is represented by the following formula:
formula_26
where:
*&quot;p&quot; is liquid pressure,
*&quot;g&quot; is gravity at the surface of overlaying material,
*&quot;ρ&quot; is density of liquid,
*&quot;h&quot; is height of liquid column or depth within a substance.

Another way of saying the same formula is the following:
formula_27

The pressure a liquid exerts against the sides and bottom of a container depends on the density and the depth of the liquid. If atmospheric pressure is neglected, liquid pressure against the bottom is twice as great at twice the depth; at three times the depth, the liquid pressure is threefold; etc. Or, if the liquid is two or three times as dense, the liquid pressure is correspondingly two or three times as great for any given depth. Liquids are practically incompressible – that is, their volume can hardly be changed by pressure (water volume decreases by only 50 millionths of its original volume for each atmospheric increase in pressure). Thus, except for small changes produced by temperature, the density of a particular liquid is practically the same at all depths.

Atmospheric pressure pressing on the surface of a liquid must be taken into account when trying to discover the &quot;total&quot; pressure acting on a liquid. The total pressure of a liquid, then, is &quot;ρgh&quot; plus the pressure of the atmosphere. When this distinction is important, the term &quot;total pressure&quot; is used. Otherwise, discussions of liquid pressure refer to pressure without regard to the normally ever-present atmospheric pressure.

The pressure does not depend on the &quot;amount&quot; of liquid present. Volume is not the important factor – depth is. The average water pressure acting against a dam depends on the average depth of the water and not on the volume of water held back. For example, a wide but shallow lake with a depth of exerts only half the average pressure that a small deep pond does. (The &quot;total force&quot; applied to the longer dam will be greater, due to the greater total surface area for the pressure to act upon. But for a given -wide section of each dam, the deep water will apply one quarter the force of deep water). A person will feel the same pressure whether their head is dunked a metre beneath the surface of the water in a small pool or to the same depth in the middle of a large lake.

If four interconnected vases contain different amounts of water but are all filled to equal depths, then a fish with its head dunked a few centimetres under the surface will be acted on by water pressure that is the same in any of the vases. If the fish swims a few centimetres deeper, the pressure on the fish will increase with depth and be the same no matter which vase the fish is in. If the fish swims to the bottom, the pressure will be greater, but it makes no difference which vase it is in. All vases are filled to equal depths, so the water pressure is the same at the bottom of each vase, regardless of its shape or volume. If water pressure at the bottom of a vase were greater than water pressure at the bottom of a neighboring vase, the greater pressure would force water sideways and then up the neighboring vase to a higher level until the pressures at the bottom were equalized. Pressure is depth dependent, not volume dependent, so there is a reason that water seeks its own level.

Restating this as an energy equation, the energy per unit volume in an ideal, incompressible liquid is constant throughout its vessel. At the surface, gravitational potential energy is large but liquid pressure energy is low. At the bottom of the vessel, all the gravitational potential energy is converted to pressure energy. The sum of pressure energy and gravitational potential energy per unit volume is constant throughout the volume of the fluid and the two energy components change linearly with the depth. Mathematically, it is described by Bernoulli&#x27;s equation, where velocity head is zero and comparisons per unit volume in the vessel are
formula_28

Terms have the same meaning as in section Fluid pressure.

===Direction of liquid pressure===
An experimentally determined fact about liquid pressure is that it is exerted equally in all directions. If someone is submerged in water, no matter which way that person tilts their head, the person will feel the same amount of water pressure on their ears. Because a liquid can flow, this pressure is not only downward. Pressure is seen acting sideways when water spurts sideways from a leak in the side of an upright can. Pressure also acts upward, as demonstrated when someone tries to push a beach ball beneath the surface of the water. The bottom of a ball is pushed upward by water pressure (buoyancy).

When a liquid presses against a surface, there is a net force that is perpendicular to the surface. Although pressure does not have a specific direction, force does. A submerged triangular block has water forced against each point from many directions, but components of the force that are not perpendicular to the surface cancel each other out, leaving only a net perpendicular point. This is why liquid particles&#x27; velocity only alters in a normal component after they are collided to the container&#x27;s wall. Likewise, if the collision site is a hole, water spurting from the hole in a bucket initially exits the bucket in a direction at right angles to the surface of the bucket in which the hole is located. Then it curves downward due to gravity. If there are three holes in a bucket (top, bottom, and middle), then the force vectors perpendicular to the inner container surface will increase with increasing depth – that is, a greater pressure at the bottom makes it so that the bottom hole will shoot water out the farthest. The force exerted by a fluid on a smooth surface is always at right angles to the surface. The speed of liquid out of the hole is formula_29, where &quot;h&quot; is the depth below the free surface. As predicted by Torricelli&#x27;s law this is the same speed the water (or anything else) would have if freely falling the same vertical distance &quot;h&quot;.

===Kinematic pressure===
formula_30
is the kinematic pressure, where formula_2 is the pressure and formula_32 constant mass density. The SI unit of &quot;P&quot; is m2/s2. Kinematic pressure is used in the same manner as kinematic viscosity formula_33 in order to compute the Navier–Stokes equation without explicitly showing the density formula_32.

<text>In geometry, a polygon () is a plane figure made up of line segments connected to form a closed polygonal chain.

The segments of a closed polygonal chain are called its &quot;edges&quot; or &quot;sides&quot;. The points where two edges meet are the polygon&#x27;s &quot;vertices&quot; or &quot;corners&quot;. An &quot;n&quot;-gon is a polygon with &quot;n&quot; sides; for example, a triangle is a 3-gon.

A simple polygon is one which does not intersect itself. More precisely, the only allowed intersections among the line segments that make up the polygon are the shared endpoints of consecutive segments in the polygonal chain. A simple polygon is the boundary of a region of the plane that is called a &quot;solid polygon&quot;. The interior of a solid polygon is its &quot;body&quot;, also known as a polygonal region or polygonal area. In contexts where one is concerned only with simple and solid polygons, a &quot;polygon&quot; may refer only to a simple polygon or to a solid polygon. 

A polygonal chain may cross over itself, creating star polygons and other self-intersecting polygons. Some sources also consider closed polygonal chains in Euclidean space to be a type of polygon (a skew polygon), even when the chain does not lie in a single plane.

A polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions. There are many more generalizations of polygons defined for different purposes.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;polygon&quot; derives from the Greek adjective πολύς (&quot;polús&quot;) &#x27;much&#x27;, &#x27;many&#x27; and γωνία (&quot;gōnía&quot;) &#x27;corner&#x27; or &#x27;angle&#x27;. It has been suggested that γόνυ (&quot;gónu&quot;) &#x27;knee&#x27; may be the origin of &quot;gon&quot;.

==Classification==
===Number of sides===
Polygons are primarily classified by the number of sides.

===Convexity and intersection===
Polygons may be characterized by their convexity or type of non-convexity:
* Convex: any line drawn through the polygon (and not tangent to an edge or corner) meets its boundary exactly twice. As a consequence, all its interior angles are less than 180°. Equivalently, any line segment with endpoints on the boundary passes through only interior points between its endpoints. This condition is true for polygons in any geometry, not just Euclidean.
* Non-convex: a line may be found which meets its boundary more than twice. Equivalently, there exists a line segment between two boundary points that passes outside the polygon.
* Simple: the boundary of the polygon does not cross itself. All convex polygons are simple.
* Concave: Non-convex and simple. There is at least one interior angle greater than 180°.
* Star-shaped: the whole interior is visible from at least one point, without crossing any edge. The polygon must be simple, and may be convex or concave. All convex polygons are star-shaped.
* Self-intersecting: the boundary of the polygon crosses itself. The term &quot;complex&quot; is sometimes used in contrast to &quot;simple&quot;, but this usage risks confusion with the idea of a &quot;complex polygon&quot; as one which exists in the complex Hilbert plane consisting of two complex dimensions.
* Star polygon: a polygon which self-intersects in a regular way. A polygon cannot be both a star and star-shaped.

===Equality and symmetry===
* Equiangular: all corner angles are equal.
* Equilateral: all edges are of the same length.
* Regular: both equilateral and equiangular.
* Cyclic: all corners lie on a single circle, called the circumcircle.
* Tangential: all sides are tangent to an inscribed circle.
* Isogonal or vertex-transitive: all corners lie within the same symmetry orbit. The polygon is also cyclic and equiangular.
* Isotoxal or edge-transitive: all sides lie within the same symmetry orbit. The polygon is also equilateral and tangential.

The property of regularity may be defined in other ways: a polygon is regular if and only if it is both isogonal and isotoxal, or equivalently it is both cyclic and equilateral. A non-convex regular polygon is called a &quot;regular star polygon&quot;.

===Miscellaneous===
* Rectilinear: the polygon&#x27;s sides meet at right angles, i.e. all its interior angles are 90 or 270 degrees.
* Monotone with respect to a given line &quot;L&quot;: every line orthogonal to L intersects the polygon not more than twice.

==Properties and formulas==

Euclidean geometry is assumed throughout.

===Angles===
Any polygon has as many corners as it has sides. Each corner has several angles. The two most important ones are:
* Interior angle – The sum of the interior angles of a simple &quot;n&quot;-gon is radians or degrees. This is because any simple &quot;n&quot;-gon ( having &quot;n&quot; sides ) can be considered to be made up of triangles, each of which has an angle sum of π radians or 180 degrees. The measure of any interior angle of a convex regular &quot;n&quot;-gon is formula_1 radians or formula_2 degrees. The interior angles of regular star polygons were first studied by Poinsot, in the same paper in which he describes the four regular star polyhedra: for a regular formula_3-gon (a &quot;p&quot;-gon with central density &quot;q&quot;), each interior angle is formula_4 radians or formula_5 degrees.
* Exterior angle – The exterior angle is the supplementary angle to the interior angle. Tracing around a convex &quot;n&quot;-gon, the angle &quot;turned&quot; at a corner is the exterior or external angle. Tracing all the way around the polygon makes one full turn, so the sum of the exterior angles must be 360°. This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an &quot;n&quot;-gon in general, the sum of the exterior angles (the total amount one rotates at the vertices) can be any integer multiple &quot;d&quot; of 360°, e.g. 720° for a pentagram and 0° for an angular &quot;eight&quot; or antiparallelogram, where &quot;d&quot; is the density or turning number of the polygon.

===Area===
In this section, the vertices of the polygon under consideration are taken to be formula_6 in order. For convenience in some formulas, the notation will also be used.

====Simple polygons====
If the polygon is non-self-intersecting (that is, simple), the signed area is
:formula_7
or, using determinants
:formula_8
where formula_9 is the squared distance between formula_10 and formula_11

The signed area depends on the ordering of the vertices and of the orientation of the plane. Commonly, the positive orientation is defined by the (counterclockwise) rotation that maps the positive -axis to the positive -axis. If the vertices are ordered counterclockwise (that is, according to positive orientation), the signed area is positive; otherwise, it is negative. In either case, the area formula is correct in absolute value. This is commonly called the &quot;shoelace formula&quot; or &quot;surveyor&#x27;s formula&quot;.

The area &quot;A&quot; of a simple polygon can also be computed if the lengths of the sides, &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;an&quot; and the exterior angles, &quot;θ&quot;1, &quot;θ&quot;2, ..., &quot;θn&quot; are known, from:
:formula_12
The formula was described by Lopshits in 1963.

If the polygon can be drawn on an equally spaced grid such that all its vertices are grid points, Pick&#x27;s theorem gives a simple formula for the polygon&#x27;s area based on the numbers of interior and boundary grid points: the former number plus one-half the latter number, minus 1.

In every polygon with perimeter &quot;p&quot; and area &quot;A &quot;, the isoperimetric inequality formula_13 holds.

For any two simple polygons of equal area, the Bolyai–Gerwien theorem asserts that the first can be cut into polygonal pieces which can be reassembled to form the second polygon.

The lengths of the sides of a polygon do not in general determine its area. However, if the polygon is simple and cyclic then the sides &quot;do&quot; determine the area. Of all &quot;n&quot;-gons with given side lengths, the one with the largest area is cyclic. Of all &quot;n&quot;-gons with a given perimeter, the one with the largest area is regular (and therefore cyclic).

====Regular polygons====
Many specialized formulas apply to the areas of regular polygons.

The area of a regular polygon is given in terms of the radius &quot;r&quot; of its inscribed circle and its perimeter &quot;p&quot; by 
:formula_14
This radius is also termed its apothem and is often represented as &quot;a&quot;.

The area of a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon can be expressed in terms of the radius &quot;R&quot; of its circumscribed circle (the unique circle passing through all vertices of the regular &quot;n&quot;-gon) as follows:
:formula_15

====Self-intersecting====
The area of a self-intersecting polygon can be defined in two different ways, giving different answers:
* Using the formulas for simple polygons, we allow that particular regions within the polygon may have their area multiplied by a factor which we call the &quot;density&quot; of the region. For example, the central convex pentagon in the center of a pentagram has density 2. The two triangular regions of a cross-quadrilateral (like a figure 8) have opposite-signed densities, and adding their areas together can give a total area of zero for the whole figure.
* Considering the enclosed regions as point sets, we can find the area of the enclosed point set. This corresponds to the area of the plane covered by the polygon or to the area of one or more simple polygons having the same outline as the self-intersecting one. In the case of the cross-quadrilateral, it is treated as two simple triangles.

===Centroid===
Using the same convention for vertex coordinates as in the previous section, the coordinates of the centroid of a solid simple polygon are 
:formula_16
:formula_17
In these formulas, the signed value of area formula_18 must be used.

For triangles (), the centroids of the vertices and of the solid shape are the same, but, in general, this is not true for . The centroid of the vertex set of a polygon with vertices has the coordinates
:formula_19
:formula_20

==Generalizations==

The idea of a polygon has been generalized in various ways. Some of the more important include:
* A spherical polygon is a circuit of arcs of great circles (sides) and vertices on the surface of a sphere. It allows the digon, a polygon having only two sides and two corners, which is impossible in a flat plane. Spherical polygons play an important role in cartography (map making) and in Wythoff&#x27;s construction of the uniform polyhedra.
* A skew polygon does not lie in a flat plane, but zigzags in three (or more) dimensions. The Petrie polygons of the regular polytopes are well known examples.
* An apeirogon is an infinite sequence of sides and angles, which is not closed but has no ends because it extends indefinitely in both directions.
* A skew apeirogon is an infinite sequence of sides and angles that do not lie in a flat plane.
* A polygon with holes is an area-connected or multiply-connected planar polygon with one external boundary and one or more interior boundaries (holes).
* A complex polygon is a configuration analogous to an ordinary polygon, which exists in the complex plane of two real and two imaginary dimensions.
* An abstract polygon is an algebraic partially ordered set representing the various elements (sides, vertices, etc.) and their connectivity. A real geometric polygon is said to be a &quot;realization&quot; of the associated abstract polygon. Depending on the mapping, all the generalizations described here can be realized.
* A polyhedron is a three-dimensional solid bounded by flat polygonal faces, analogous to a polygon in two dimensions. The corresponding shapes in four or higher dimensions are called polytopes. (In other conventions, the words &quot;polyhedron&quot; and &quot;polytope&quot; are used in any dimension, with the distinction between the two that a polytope is necessarily bounded.)

==Naming==
The word &quot;polygon&quot; comes from Late Latin &quot;polygōnum&quot; (a noun), from Greek πολύγωνον (&quot;polygōnon/polugōnon&quot;), noun use of neuter of πολύγωνος (&quot;polygōnos/polugōnos&quot;, the masculine adjective), meaning &quot;many-angled&quot;. Individual polygons are named (and sometimes classified) according to the number of sides, combining a Greek-derived numerical prefix with the suffix &quot;-gon&quot;, e.g. &quot;pentagon&quot;, &quot;dodecagon&quot;. The triangle, quadrilateral and nonagon are exceptions.

Beyond decagons (10-sided) and dodecagons (12-sided), mathematicians generally use numerical notation, for example 17-gon and 257-gon.

Exceptions exist for side counts that are easily expressed in verbal form (e.g. 20 and 30), or are used by non-mathematicians. Some special polygons also have their own names; for example the regular star pentagon is also known as the pentagram.
To construct the name of a polygon with more than 20 and fewer than 100 edges, combine the prefixes as follows. The &quot;kai&quot; term applies to 13-gons and higher and was used by Kepler, and advocated by John H. Conway for clarity of concatenated prefix numbers in the naming of quasiregular polyhedra, though not all sources use it.
==History==

Polygons have been known since ancient times. The regular polygons were known to the ancient Greeks, with the pentagram, a non-convex regular polygon (star polygon), appearing as early as the 7th century B.C. on a krater by Aristophanes, found at Caere and now in the Capitoline Museum.

The first known systematic study of non-convex polygons in general was made by Thomas Bradwardine in the 14th century.

In 1952, Geoffrey Colin Shephard generalized the idea of polygons to the complex plane, where each real dimension is accompanied by an imaginary one, to create complex polygons.

==In nature==

Polygons appear in rock formations, most commonly as the flat facets of crystals, where the angles between the sides depend on the type of mineral from which the crystal is made.

Regular hexagons can occur when the cooling of lava forms areas of tightly packed columns of basalt, which may be seen at the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Northern Ireland, or at the Devil&#x27;s Postpile in California.

In biology, the surface of the wax honeycomb made by bees is an array of hexagons, and the sides and base of each cell are also polygons.

==Computer graphics==
In computer graphics, a polygon is a primitive used in modelling and rendering. They are defined in a database, containing arrays of vertices (the coordinates of the geometrical vertices, as well as other attributes of the polygon, such as color, shading and texture), connectivity information, and materials.

Any surface is modelled as a tessellation called polygon mesh. If a square mesh has points (vertices) per side, there are &quot;n&quot; squared squares in the mesh, or 2&quot;n&quot; squared triangles since there are two triangles in a square. There are vertices per triangle. Where &quot;n&quot; is large, this approaches one half. Or, each vertex inside the square mesh connects four edges (lines).

The imaging system calls up the structure of polygons needed for the scene to be created from the database. This is transferred to active memory and finally, to the display system (screen, TV monitors etc.) so that the scene can be viewed. During this process, the imaging system renders polygons in correct perspective ready for transmission of the processed data to the display system. Although polygons are two-dimensional, through the system computer they are placed in a visual scene in the correct three-dimensional orientation.

In computer graphics and computational geometry, it is often necessary to determine whether a given point formula_21 lies inside a simple polygon given by a sequence of line segments. This is called the point in polygon test.

<text>A player character (also known as a playable character or PC) is a fictional character in a video game or tabletop role-playing game whose actions are controlled by a player rather than the rules of the game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games. The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling the character.

Video games typically have one player character for each person playing the game. Some games, such as multiplayer online battle arena, hero shooter, and fighting games, offer a group of player characters for the player to choose from, allowing the player to control one of them at a time. Where more than one player character is available, the characters may have distinctive abilities and differing styles of play.

==Overview==
===Avatars===


A player character may sometimes be based on a real person, especially in sports games that use the names and likenesses of real athletes. Historical figures and leaders may sometimes appear as characters too, particularly in strategy or empire building games such as in Sid Meier&#x27;s &quot;Civilization&quot; series. Such a player character is more properly an avatar as the player character&#x27;s name and image typically have little bearing on the game itself. Avatars are also commonly seen in casino game simulations.

===Blank characters===
In many video games, and especially first-person shooters, the player character is a &quot;blank slate&quot; without any notable characteristics or even backstory. Pac-Man, Crono from &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, Link from &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, Chell from &quot;Portal&quot;, and Claude from &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; are examples of such characters. These characters are generally silent protagonists.

Some games will go even further, never showing or naming the player character at all. This is somewhat common in first-person videogames, such as in &quot;Myst&quot;, but is more often done in strategy video games such as &quot;Dune 2000,&quot; &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; series. In such games, the only real indication that the player has a character (instead of an omnipresent status), is from the cutscenes during which the character is being given a mission briefing or debriefing; the player is usually addressed as &quot;general&quot;, &quot;commander&quot;, or another military rank.

In gaming culture, such a character was called Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally Ambiguous Adventure Person, abbreviated as AFGNCAAP; a term that originated in &quot;&quot; where it is used satirically to refer to the player.

===Character action games===
Character action games (also called character-driven games, character games or just action games) are a broad category of action games, referring to a variety of games that are driven by the physical actions of player characters. The term dates back to the golden age of arcade video games in the early 1980s, when the terms &quot;action games&quot; and &quot;character games&quot; began being used to distinguish a new emerging genre of character-driven action games from the space shoot &#x27;em ups that had previously dominated the arcades in the late 1970s. Classic examples of character action games from that period include maze games like &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, platformers like &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, and &quot;Frogger&quot;.

Side-scrolling character action games (also called &quot;side-scrolling action games&quot; or &quot;side-scrollers&quot;) are a broad category of character action games that were popular from the mid-1980s to the 1990s, which involve player characters defeating large groups of weaker enemies along a side-scrolling playfield. Examples include beat &#x27;em ups like &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; and &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, ninja action games like &quot;The Legend of Kage&quot; and &quot;Shinobi&quot;, scrolling platformers like &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, and run and gun shooters like &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; and &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;.

&quot;Character action games&quot; is also a term used for 3D hack and slash games modelled after &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, which represent an evolution of arcade character action games. Other examples of this sub-genre include &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, &quot;God of War&quot;, and &quot;Bayonetta&quot;.

===Fighting games===
Fighting games typically have a larger number of player characters to choose from, with some basic moves available to all or most characters and some unique moves only available to one or a few characters. Having many distinctive characters to play as and against, all possessing different moves and abilities, is necessary to create a larger gameplay variety in such games.

===Hero shooters===
Similarly to MOBAs, hero shooters emphasize pre-designed &quot;hero&quot; characters with distinctive abilities and weapons that are not available to the other characters. Hero shooters strongly encourage teamwork between players on a team, guiding players to select effective combinations of hero characters and coordinate the use of hero abilities during a match.

===Multiplayer online battle arena===
Multiplayer online battle arena games offer a large group of viable player characters for the player to choose from, each of which having distinctive abilities, strengths, and weaknesses to make the game play style different. Characters can learn new abilities or augment existing ones over the course of a match by collecting experience points. Choosing a character who complements the player&#x27;s teammates and counters their opponents opens up a strategy before the beginning of the match itself. Playable characters blend a variety of fantasy tropes, featuring numerous references to popular culture and mythology.

===Role-playing games===
In both tabletop role playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and role-playing video games such as &quot;Final Fantasy,&quot; a player typically creates or takes on the identity of a character that may have nothing in common with the player. The character is often of a certain (usually fictional) race and class (such as zombie, berserker, rifleman, elf, or cleric), each with strengths and weaknesses. The attributes of the characters (such as magic and fighting ability) are given as numerical values which can be increased as the gamer progresses and gains rank and experience points through accomplishing goals or fighting enemies.

===Sports games===
In many sports games, player characters are often modelled after real-life athletes, as opposed to fictional characters. This is particularly the case for sports simulation games, whereas many arcade-style sports games often have fictional characters instead.

==Secret characters==

A secret or unlockable character is a playable character in a video game available only after either completing the game or meeting another requirement. In some video games, characters that are not secret but appear only as non-player characters like bosses or enemies become playable characters after completing certain requirements, or sometimes cheating.

<text>A parish is a territorial entity in many Christian denominations, constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a priest, often termed a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor. Its association with the parish church remains paramount.

By extension the term &quot;parish&quot; refers not only to the territorial entity but to the people of its community or congregation as well as to church property within it. In England this church property was technically in ownership of the parish priest &quot;ex officio&quot;, vested in him on his institution to that parish.

==Etymology and use==
First attested in English in the late 13th century, the word &quot;parish&quot; comes from the Old French , in turn from , the Romanisation of the , &quot;sojourning in a foreign land&quot;, itself from (&quot;paroikos&quot;), &quot;dwelling beside, stranger, sojourner&quot;, which is a compound of (&quot;pará&quot;), &quot;beside, by, near&quot; and (&quot;oîkos&quot;), &quot;house&quot;.

As an ancient concept, the term &quot;parish&quot; occurs in the long-established Christian denominations: Catholic, Anglican Communion, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Lutheran churches, and in some Methodist, Congregationalist and Presbyterian administrations.

The eighth Archbishop of Canterbury Theodore of Tarsus (c. 602–690) appended the parish structure to the Anglo-Saxon township unit, where it existed, and where minsters catered to the surrounding district.

==Territorial structure==

Broadly speaking, the parish is the standard unit in episcopal polity of church administration, although parts of a parish may be subdivided as a &quot;chapelry&quot;, with a chapel of ease or filial church serving as the local place of worship in cases of difficulty to access the main parish church.

In the wider picture of ecclesiastical polity, a &quot;parish&quot; comprises a division of a diocese or see. Parishes within a diocese may be grouped into a deanery or &quot;vicariate forane&quot; (or simply &quot;vicariate&quot;), overseen by a dean or &quot;vicar forane&quot;, or in some cases by an archpriest. Some churches of the Anglican Communion have deaneries as units of an archdeaconry.

===Outstations===
An outstation is a newly created congregation, a term usually used where the church is evangelical, or a mission and particularly in African countries, but also historically in Australia. They exist mostly within the Catholic and Anglican parishes.

The Anglican Diocese of Cameroon describes their outstations as the result of outreach work &quot;initiated, sponsored and supervised by the mother parishes&quot;. Once there is a big enough group of worshippers in the same place, the outstation is named by the bishop of the diocese. They are run by &quot;catechists/evangelists&quot; or lay readers, and supervised by the creator parish or archdeaconry.

Outstations are not self-supporting, and in poor areas often consist of a very simple structure. The parish priest visits as often as possible. If and when the community has grown enough, the outstation may become a parish and have a parish priest assigned to it.

==Catholic Church==

In the Catholic Church, each parish normally has its own parish priest (in some countries called pastor or provost), who has responsibility and canonical authority over the parish.

What in most English-speaking countries is termed the &quot;parish priest&quot; is referred to as the &quot;pastor&quot; in the United States, where the term &quot;parish priest&quot; is used of any priest assigned to a parish even in a subordinate capacity. These are called &quot;assistant priests&quot;, &quot;parochial vicars&quot;, &quot;curates&quot;, or, in the United States, &quot;associate pastors&quot; and &quot;assistant pastors&quot;.

Each diocese (administrative region) is divided into parishes, each with their own central church called the parish church, where religious services take place. Some larger parishes or parishes that have been combined under one parish priest may have two or more such churches, or the parish may be responsible for chapels (or chapels of ease) located at some distance from the mother church for the convenience of distant parishioners. In addition to a parish church, each parish may maintain auxiliary organizations and their facilities such as a rectory, parish hall, parochial school, or convent, frequently located on the same campus or adjacent to the church.

Normally, a parish comprises all Catholics living within its geographically defined area, but non-territorial parishes can also be established within a defined area on a personal basis for Catholics belonging to a particular rite, language, nationality, or community. An example is that of personal parishes established in accordance with the 7 July 2007 &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; for those attached to the pre-Vatican II liturgy.

==Lutheran Churches==
In the Lutheran Churches, parishes (Swedish: &quot;socken&quot; or &quot;församling&quot;) are territorial, meaning that they include the people living within its boundaries.

At the end of the 19th century, the Church of Sweden possessed 2,000 parishes.

==Anglican Churches==
===Church of England===

The Church of England&#x27;s geographical structure uses the local parish church as its basic unit. The parish system survived the Reformation with the Anglican Church&#x27;s secession from Rome remaining largely untouched; thus, it shares its roots with the Catholic Church&#x27;s system described above. Parishes may extend into different counties or hundreds and historically many parishes comprised extra outlying portions in addition to its principal district, usually being described as &#x27;detached&#x27; and intermixed with the lands of other parishes. Church of England parishes nowadays all lie within one of 42 dioceses divided between the provinces of Canterbury, 30 and York, 12.

Each parish normally has its own parish priest (either a vicar or rector, owing to the vagaries of the feudal tithe system: rectories usually having had greater income) and perhaps supported by one or more curates or deacons - although as a result of ecclesiastical pluralism some parish priests might have held more than one parish living, placing a curate in charge of those where they do not reside. Now, however, it is common for a number of neighbouring parishes to be placed under one benefice in the charge of a priest who conducts services by rotation, with additional services being provided by lay readers or other non-ordained members of the church community.

A chapelry was a subdivision of an ecclesiastical parish in England, and parts of Lowland Scotland up to the mid 19th century. It had a similar status to a township but was so named as it had a chapel which acted as a subsidiary place of worship to the main parish church.

In England civil parishes and their governing parish councils evolved in the 19th century as ecclesiastical parishes began to be relieved of what became considered to be civic responsibilities. Thus their boundaries began to diverge. The word &quot;parish&quot; acquired a secular usage. Since 1895, a parish council elected by public vote or a (civil) parish meeting administers a civil parish and is formally recognised as the level of local government below a district council.

The traditional structure of the Church of England with the parish as the basic unit has been exported to other countries and churches throughout the Anglican Communion and Commonwealth but does not necessarily continue to be administered in the same way.

===Church in Wales===
The Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 and is made up of six dioceses. It retained the parish system and parishes were also civil administration areas until communities were established in 1974, but did not necessarily share the same boundaries. The reduction in the numbers of worshippers, and the increasing costs of maintaining often ancient buildings, led over time to parish reorganisation, parish groupings and Rectorial Benefices (merged parishes led by a Rector).

In 2010, the Church in Wales engaged the Rt Rev Richard Harries (Lord Harries of Pentregarth), a former Church of England Bishop of Oxford; Prof Charles Handy; and Prof Patricia Peattie, to carry out a review into the organisation of the Church and make recommendations as to its future shape. The group published its report (&quot;Church in Wales Review&quot;) in July 2012 and proposed that parishes should be reorganised into larger Ministry Areas (Ardaloedd Gweinidogaeth). It stated that &quot;the parish system, as originally set up ... is no longer sustainable&quot; and suggested that the Ministry Areas should each have a leadership team containing lay people as well as clergy, following the principles of &quot;collaborative ministry&quot;. Over the next decade, the six dioceses all implemented the report, with the final Ministry Areas being instituted in 2022. In the Diocese of Saint Asaph (Llanelwy), they are known as Mission Areas (Ardaloedd Cenhadaeth).

==Presbyterian Churches==
===Church of Scotland===

The parish is also the basic level of church administration in the Church of Scotland. Spiritual oversight of each parish church in Scotland is responsibility of the congregation&#x27;s Kirk Session. Patronage was regulated in 1711 (Patronage Act) and abolished in 1874, with the result that ministers must be elected by members of the congregation. Many parish churches in Scotland today are &quot;linked&quot; with neighbouring parish churches served by a single minister. Since the abolition of parishes as a unit of civil government in Scotland in 1929, Scottish parishes have purely ecclesiastical significance and the boundaries may be adjusted by the local Presbytery.

==Methodist Church==
In the United Methodist Church congregations are called parishes, though they are more often simply called congregations and have no geographic boundaries. A prominent example of this usage comes in &quot;The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church&quot;, in which the committee of every local congregation that handles staff support is referred to as the committee on Pastor-Parish Relations. This committee gives recommendations to the bishop on behalf of the parish/congregation since it is the United Methodist Bishop of the episcopal area who appoints a pastor to each congregation. The same is true in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.

In New Zealand, a local grouping of Methodist churches that share one or more ministers (which in the United Kingdom would be called a circuit) is referred to as a parish.

<text>Procopius of Caesarea (; &quot;Prokópios ho Kaisareús&quot;; ; – 565) was a prominent late antique Greek scholar and historian from Caesarea Maritima. Accompanying the Roman general Belisarius in Emperor Justinian&#x27;s wars, Procopius became the principal Roman historian of the 6th century, writing the &quot;History of the Wars&quot;, the &quot;Buildings&quot;, and the &quot;Secret History&quot;.

==Early life==
Apart from his own writings, the main source for Procopius&#x27;s life is an entry in the &quot;Suda&quot;, a Byzantine Greek encyclopaedia written sometime after 975 which discusses his early life. He was a native of Caesarea in the province of &quot;Palaestina Prima&quot;. He would have received a conventional upper class education in the Greek classics and rhetoric, perhaps at the famous school at Gaza. He may have attended law school, possibly at Berytus (present-day Beirut) or Constantinople (now Istanbul), and became a lawyer (&quot;rhetor&quot;). He evidently knew Latin, as was natural for a man with legal training. 

==Career==
In 527, the first year of the reign of the emperor JustinianI, he became the legal adviser (&quot;&quot;) for Belisarius, a general whom Justinian made his chief military commander in a great attempt to restore control over the lost western provinces of the empire.

Procopius was with Belisarius on the eastern front until the latter was defeated at the Battle of Callinicum in 531 and recalled to Constantinople. Procopius witnessed the Nika riots of January, 532, which Belisarius and his fellow general Mundus repressed with a massacre in the Hippodrome there. In 533, he accompanied Belisarius on his victorious expedition against the Vandal kingdom in North Africa, took part in the capture of Carthage, and remained in Africa with Belisarius&#x27;s successor Solomon the Eunuch when Belisarius returned east to the capital. Procopius recorded a few of the extreme weather events of 535–536, although these were presented as a backdrop to Byzantine military activities, such as a mutiny in and around Carthage. He rejoined Belisarius for his campaign against the Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy and experienced the Gothic siege of Rome that lasted a year and nine days, ending in mid-March 538. He witnessed Belisarius&#x27;s entry into the Gothic capital, Ravenna, in 540. Both the &quot;Wars&quot; and the &quot;Secret History&quot; suggest that his relationship with Belisarius cooled thereafter. When Belisarius was sent back to Italy in 544 to cope with a renewal of the war with the Goths, now led by the able king Totila, Procopius appears to have no longer been on Belisarius&#x27;s staff.

As &quot;magister militum&quot;, Belisarius was an &quot;illustrious man&quot; (; , &quot;illoústrios&quot;); being his &#x27;, Procopius must therefore have had at least the rank of a &quot;visible man&quot; (&quot;vir spectabilis&quot;). He thus belonged to the mid-ranking group of the senatorial order (&#x27;). However, the &quot;Suda&quot;, which is usually well-informed in such matters, also describes Procopius himself as one of the &#x27;. Should this information be correct, Procopius would have had a seat in Constantinople&#x27;s senate, which was restricted to the &#x27; under Justinian. He also wrote that under Justinian&#x27;s reign in 560, a major Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary was built on the site of the Temple Mount.

==Death==
It is not certain when Procopius died. Many historiansincluding Howard-Johnson, Cameron, and Geoffrey Greatrexdate his death to 554, but there was an urban prefect of Constantinople (&quot;&quot;) who was called Procopius in 562. In that year, Belisarius was implicated in a conspiracy and was brought before this urban prefect.

==Writings==
The writings of Procopius are the primary source of information for the rule of the emperor JustinianI. Procopius was the author of a history in eight books on the wars prosecuted by Justinian, a panegyric on the emperor&#x27;s public works projects throughout the empire, and a book known as the &quot;Secret History&quot; that claims to report the scandals that Procopius could not include in his officially sanctioned history for fear of angering the emperor, his wife, Belisarius, and the general&#x27;s wife. Consequently publication was delayed until all of them were dead to avoid retaliation.
===&quot;History of the Wars&quot;===
Procopius&#x27;s &quot;Wars&quot; or &quot;History of the Wars&quot; (, &quot;Hypèr tōn Polémon Lógoi&quot;, &quot;Words on the Wars&quot;; , &quot;On the Wars&quot;) is his most important work, although less well known than the &quot;Secret History&quot;. The first seven books seem to have been largely completed by 545 and may have been published as a set. They were, however, updated to mid-century before publication, with the latest mentioned event occurring in early 551. The eighth and final book brought the history to 553.
The first two booksoften known as &quot;The Persian War&quot; ()deal with the conflict between the Romans and Sassanid Persia in Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia, Lazica, and Iberia (present-day Georgia). It details the campaigns of the Sassanid shah KavadhI, the 532 &#x27;Nika&#x27; revolt, the war by Kavadh&#x27;s successor KhosrauI in 540, his destruction of Antioch and deportation of its inhabitants to Mesopotamia, and the great plague that devastated the empire from 542. The &quot;Persian War&quot; also covers the early career of Procopius&#x27;s patron Belisarius in some detail.
The &quot;Wars&quot;’ next two booksknown as &quot;The Vandal War&quot; or &quot;Vandalic War&quot; ()cover Belisarius&#x27;s successful campaign against the Vandal kingdom that had occupied Rome&#x27;s provinces in northwest Africa for the last century.
The final four booksknown as &quot;The Gothic War&quot; ()cover the Italian campaigns by Belisarius and others against the Ostrogoths. Procopius includes accounts of the 1st and 2nd sieges of Naples and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd sieges of Rome. He also includes an account of the rise of the Franks (see &quot;Arborychoi&quot;). The last book describes the eunuch Narses&#x27;s successful conclusion of the Italian campaign and includes some coverage of campaigns along the empire&#x27;s eastern borders as well.

The &quot;Wars&quot; proved influential on later Byzantine historiography.
In the 570s Agathias wrote &quot;Histories&quot;, a continuation of Procopius&#x27;s work in a similar style.
===&quot;Secret History&quot;===

Procopius&#x27;s now famous &quot;Anecdota&quot;, also known as &quot;Secret History&quot; (, &quot;Apókryphe Historía&quot;; ), was discovered centuries later at the Vatican Library in Rome and published in Lyon by Niccolò Alamanni in 1623. Its existence was already known from the &quot;Suda&quot;, which referred to it as Procopius&#x27;s &quot;unpublished works&quot; containing &quot;comedy&quot; and &quot;invective&quot; of Justinian, Theodora, Belisarius and Antonina. The &quot;Secret History&quot; covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of &quot;The History of the Wars&quot; and appears to have been written after they were published. Current consensus generally dates it to 550, or less commonly 558.

In the eyes of many scholars, the &quot;Secret History&quot; reveals an author who had become deeply disillusioned with Emperor Justinian, his wife Theodora, the general Belisarius, and his wife Antonina. The work claims to expose the secret springs of their public actions, as well as the private lives of the emperor and his entourage. Justinian is portrayed as cruel, venal, prodigal, and incompetent. In one passage, it is even claimed that he was possessed by demonic spirits or was himself a demon:

Similarly, the Theodora of the &quot;Secret History&quot; is a garish portrait of vulgarity and insatiable lust juxtaposed with cold-blooded self-interest, shrewishness, and envious and fearful mean-spiritedness. Among the more titillating (and dubious) revelations in the &quot;Secret History&quot; is Procopius&#x27;s account of Theodora&#x27;s thespian accomplishments:

Furthermore, &quot;Secret History&quot; portrays Belisarius as a weak man completely emasculated by his wife, Antonina, who is portrayed in very similar terms to Theodora. They are both said to be former actresses and close friends. Procopius claimed Antonina worked as an agent for Theodora against Belisarius, and had an ongoing affair with Belisarius&#x27; godson, Theodosius.

Justinian and Theodora are portrayed as the antithesis of &quot;good&quot; rulers, with each representing the opposite side of emotional spectrum. Justinian was of &quot;approachable and kindly&quot; temperament, even while ordering property confiscations or people&#x27;s destruction. Conversely, Theodora was described as irrational and driven by her anger, often by minor affronts.

==== Interpretations ====

Procopius is believed to be aligned with many of the senatorial ranks that disagreed with Justinian and Theodora&#x27;s tax policies and property confiscations (&quot;Secret History&quot; 12.12-14). 

On the other hand, it has been argued that Procopius prepared the &quot;Secret History&quot; as an exaggerated document out of fear that a conspiracy might overthrow Justinian&#x27;s regime, whichas a kind of court historianmight be reckoned to include him. The unpublished manuscript would then have been a kind of insurance, which could be offered to the new ruler as a way to avoid execution or exile after the coup. If this hypothesis were correct, the &quot;Secret History&quot; would not be proof that Procopius hated Justinian or Theodora.
Researcher Anthony Kaldellis suggests that the &quot;Secret History&quot; is a tale of the dangers of &quot;the rule of women&quot;. Procopius&#x27;s perspective was that women&#x27;s vices vanquished men&#x27;s virtuous leadership. For Procopius, it was not that women could not lead an empire, but only women demonstrating masculine virtues were suitable as leaders. Rather than Theodora&#x27;s true possession of strength, it was Justinian&#x27;s lack of it that created the impression of strength in her. According to researcher Averil Cameron, the definition of &quot;feminine&quot; behavior in the sixth century would be described as &quot;intriguing&quot; and &quot;interfering&quot;. She argues Procopius&#x27;s intent in including her speech during the Nika riots in the &quot;Wars&quot; may be to demonstrate that Theodora does not stay in her appropriate role. At his core, Procopius wanted to preserve the social order of men standing over women.

In Averil Cameron&#x27;s view, Procopius is more aptly described as a reporter rather than a historian, providing a black-and-white description of events, rather than a deeper analysis of the causes and motives. Cameron argues that his intense political focus and exaggeration of the imperial couple&#x27;s vices prevent a balanced and holistic perspective, resulting in a portrayal of Justinian and Theodora as caricatural villains.

===&quot;The Buildings&quot;===
&quot;The Buildings&quot; (, ; , &quot;On Buildings&quot;) is a panegyric on Justinian&#x27;s public works projects throughout the empire. The first book may date to before the collapse of the first dome of Hagia Sophia in 557, but some scholars think that it is possible that the work postdates the building of the bridge over the Sangarius in the late 550s. Historians consider &quot;Buildings&quot; to be an incomplete work due to evidence of the surviving version being a draft with two possible redactions.

&quot;Buildings&quot; was likely written at Justinian&#x27;s behest, and it is doubtful that its sentiments expressed are sincere. It tells us nothing further about Belisarius, and it takes a sharply different attitude towards Justinian. He is presented as an idealised Christian emperor who built churches for the glory of God and defenses for the safety of his subjects. He is depicted showing particular concern for the water supply, building new aqueducts and restoring those that had fallen into disuse. Theodora, who was dead when this panegyric was written, is mentioned only briefly, but Procopius&#x27;s praise of her beauty is fulsome.

Due to the panegyrical nature of Procopius&#x27;s &quot;Buildings&quot;, historians have discovered several discrepancies between claims made by Procopius and accounts in other primary sources. A prime example is Procopius&#x27;s starting the reign of Justinian in 518, which was actually the start of the reign of his uncle and predecessor By treating the uncle&#x27;s reign as part of his nephew&#x27;s, Procopius was able to credit Justinian with buildings erected or begun under Justin&#x27;s administration. Such works include renovation of the walls of Edessa after its 525 flood and consecration of several churches in the region. Similarly, Procopius falsely credits Justinian for the extensive refortification of the cities of Tomis and Histria in Scythia Minor. This had actually been carried out under who reigned before Justin.

==Style==
Procopius belongs to the school of late antique historians who continued the traditions of the Second Sophistic. They wrote in Attic Greek. Their models were Herodotus, Polybius and in particular Thucydides. Their subject matter was secular history. They avoided vocabulary unknown to Attic Greek and inserted an explanation when they had to use contemporary words. Thus Procopius includes glosses of monks (&quot;the most temperate of Christians&quot;) and churches (as equivalent to a &quot;temple&quot; or &quot;shrine&quot;), since monasticism was unknown to the ancient Athenians and their &quot;ekklesía&quot; had been a popular assembly.

The secular historians eschewed the history of the Christian church. Ecclesiastical history was left to a separate genre after Eusebius. However, Cameron has argued convincingly that Procopius&#x27;s works reflect the tensions between the classical and Christian models of history in 6th-century Constantinople. This is supported by Whitby&#x27;s analysis of Procopius&#x27;s depiction of the capital and its cathedral in comparison to contemporary pagan panegyrics. Procopius can be seen as depicting Justinian as essentially God&#x27;s vicegerent, making the case for buildings being a primarily religious panegyric. Procopius indicates that he planned to write an ecclesiastical history himself and, if he had, he would probably have followed the rules of that genre. As far as known, however, such an ecclesiastical history was never written.

Some historians have criticized Propocius&#x27;s description of some barbarians, for example, he dehumanized the unfamiliar Moors as &quot;not even properly human&quot;. This was however, inline with Byzantine ethnographic practice in late antiquity.

==Legacy==
A number of historical novels based on Procopius&#x27;s works (along with other sources) have been written. &quot;Count Belisarius&quot; was written by poet and novelist Robert Graves in 1938. Procopius himself appears as a minor character in Felix Dahn&#x27;s &quot;A Struggle for Rome&quot; and in L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s alternate history novel &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;. The novel&#x27;s main character, archaeologist Martin Padway, derives most of his knowledge of historical events from the &quot;Secret History&quot;.

The narrator in Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; cites Procopius&#x27;s description of a captured sea monster as evidence of the narrative&#x27;s feasibility.

<text>Property is a system of rights that gives people legal control of valuable things, and also refers to the valuable things themselves. Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property may have the right to consume, alter, share, rent, sell, exchange, transfer, give away, or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it under the granted property rights.

In economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: private property, public property, and collective property (or &quot;cooperative propert&quot;y). Property may be jointly owned by more than one party equally or unequally, or according to simple or complex agreements; to distinguish ownership and easement from rent, there is an expectation that each party&#x27;s will with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional.. The parties may expect their wills to be unanimous, or alternatively each may expect their own will to be sufficient when no opportunity for dispute exists. The first Restatement defines property as anything, tangible or intangible, whereby a legal relationship between persons and the State enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing. This mediating relationship between individual, property, and State is called a property regime.

In sociology and anthropology, property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object. The distinction between collective and private property is regarded as confusion, since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.

Types of property include real property (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the ground), personal property (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (State-owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and intellectual property—including exclusive rights over artistic creations and inventions. However, the latter is not always widely recognized or enforced. An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts. A title, or a right of ownership, establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit. The unqualified term &quot;property&quot; is often used to refer specifically to real property.

==Overview==

Property is often defined by the code of the local sovereignty and protected wholly or - more usually, partially - by such entity, the owner being responsible for any remainder of protection. The standards of the proof concerning proofs of ownerships are also addressed by the code of the local sovereignty, and such entity plays a role accordingly, typically somewhat managerial. Some philosophers assert that property rights arise from social convention, while others find justifications for them in morality or in natural law.

Various scholarly disciplines (such as law, economics, anthropology or sociology) may treat the concept more systematically, but definitions vary, most particularly when involving contracts. Positive law defines such rights, and the judiciary can adjudicate and enforce property rights.

According to Adam Smith (1723–1790), the expectation of profit from &quot;improving one&#x27;s stock of capital&quot; rests on private-property rights. Capitalism has as a central assumption that property rights encourage their holders to develop the property, generate wealth, and efficiently allocate resources based on the operation of markets. From this has evolved the modern conception of property as a right enforced by positive law, in the expectation that this will produce more wealth and better standards of living. However, Smith also expressed a very critical view of the effects of property laws on inequality:
In his 1881 text &quot;The Common Law&quot;, Oliver Wendell Holmes describes property as having two fundamental aspects. The first, possession, can be defined as control over a resource based on the practical inability to contradict the ends of the possessor. The second title is the expectation that others will recognize rights to control resources, even when not in possession. He elaborates on the differences between these two concepts and proposes a history of how they came to be attached to persons, as opposed to families or entities such as the church.
* Classical liberalism subscribes to the labor theory of property. Its proponents hold that individuals each own their own life; it follows that one must acknowledge the products of that life and that those products can be traded in free exchange with others.

:: &quot;Every man has a property in his person. This nobody has a right to, but himself.&quot; (John Locke, &quot;Second Treatise on Civil Government&quot;, 1689)

:: &quot;The reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property.&quot; (John Locke, &quot;Second Treatise on Civil Government&quot;, 1689)

:: &quot;Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.&quot; (Frédéric Bastiat, &quot;The Law&quot;, 1850)
* Conservatism subscribes to the concept that freedom and property are closely linked - building on traditions of thought that property guarantees freedom or causes freedom. The more widespread the possession of the private property, conservatism propounds, the more stable and productive a state or nation is. Conservatives maintain that the economic leveling of property, especially of the forced kind, is not economic progress.

:: &quot;Separate property from private possession and Leviathan becomes master of all... Upon the foundation of private property, great civilizations are built. The conservative acknowledges that the possession of property fixes certain duties upon the possessor; he accepts those moral and legal obligations cheerfully.&quot; (Russell Kirk, &quot;The Politics of Prudence&quot;, 1993)
* Socialism&#x27;s fundamental principles center on a critique of this concept, stating (among other things) that the cost of defending property exceeds the returns from private property ownership and that, even when property rights encourage their holders to develop their property or generate wealth, they do so only for their benefit, which may not coincide with advantage to other people or society at large.
* Libertarian Socialism generally accepts property rights with a short abandonment period. In other words, a person must make (more-or-less) continuous use of the item or else lose ownership rights. This is usually referred to as &quot;possession property&quot; or &quot;usufruct.&quot; Thus, in this usufruct system, absentee ownership is illegitimate, and workers own the machines or other equipment they work with.
* Communism argues that only common ownership of the means of production will assure the minimization of unequal or unjust outcomes and the maximization of benefits and that; therefore humans should abolish private ownership of capital (as opposed to property).

Both communism and some forms of socialism have also upheld the notion that private ownership of capital is inherently illegitimate. This argument centers on the idea that private ownership of capital always benefits one class over another, giving rise to domination through this privately owned capital. Communists do not oppose personal property that is &quot;hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned&quot; (as &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; puts it) by members of the proletariat. Both socialism and communism distinguish carefully between private ownership of capital (land, factories, resources, etc.) and private property (homes, material objects, and so forth).

=== Types of property ===
Most legal systems distinguish between different types of property, especially between land (immovable property, estate in land, real estate, real property) and all other forms of property—goods and chattels, movable property or personal property, including the value of legal tender if not the legal tender itself, as the manufacturer rather than the possessor might be the owner. They often distinguish tangible and intangible property. One categorization scheme specifies three species of property: land, improvements (immovable man-made things), and personal property (movable man-made things).

In common law, real property (immovable property) is the combination of interests in land and improvements thereto, and personal property is interest in movable property. Real property rights are rights relating to the land. These rights include ownership and usage. Owners can grant rights to persons and entities in the form of leases, licenses, and easements.

Throughout the last centuries of the second millennium, with the development of more complex theories of property, the concept of personal property had become divided into tangible property (such as cars and clothing) and intangible property (such as financial assets and related rights, including stocks and bonds; intellectual property, including patents, copyrights and trademarks; digital files; communication channels; and certain forms of identifier, including Internet domain names, some forms of network address, some forms of handle and again trademarks).

Treatment of intangible property is such that an article of property is, by law or otherwise by traditional conceptualization, subject to expiration even when inheritable, which is a key distinction from tangible property. Upon expiration, the property, if of the intellectual category, becomes a part of public domain, to be used by but not owned by anybody, and possibly used by more than one party simultaneously due to the inapplicability of scarcity to intellectual property. Whereas things such as communications channels and pairs of electromagnetic spectrum bands and signal transmission power can only be used by a single party at a time, or a single party in a divisible context, if owned or used. Thus far or usually, those are not considered property, or at least not private property, even though the party bearing right of exclusive use may transfer that right to another.

In many societies the human body is considered property of some kind or other. The question of the ownership and rights to one&#x27;s body arise in general in the discussion of human rights, including the specific issues of slavery, conscription, rights of children under the age of majority, marriage, abortion, prostitution, drugs, euthanasia and organ donation.

==Issues in property theory==

=== Principle ===
The two major justifications are given for the original property, or the homestead principle, are effort and scarcity. John Locke emphasized effort, &quot;mixing your labor&quot; with an object, or clearing and cultivating virgin land. Benjamin Tucker preferred to look at the telos of property, i.e., what is the purpose of property? His answer: to solve the scarcity problem. Only when items are relatively scarce concerning people&#x27;s desires, do they become property. For example, hunter-gatherers did not consider land to be property, since there was no shortage of land. Agrarian societies later made arable land property, as it was scarce. For something to be economically scarce, it must necessarily have the &quot;exclusivity property&quot;—that use by one person excludes others from using it. These two justifications lead to different conclusions on what can be property. Intellectual property—incorporeal things like ideas, plans, orderings and arrangements (musical compositions, novels, computer programs)—are generally considered valid property to those who support an effort justification, but invalid to those who support a scarcity justification, since the things don&#x27;t have the exclusivity property (however, those who support a scarcity justification may still support other &quot;intellectual property&quot; laws such as Copyright, as long as these are a subject of contract instead of government arbitration). Thus even ardent propertarians may disagree about IP. By either standard, one&#x27;s body is one&#x27;s property.

From some anarchist points of view, the validity of property depends on whether the &quot;property right&quot; requires enforcement by the State. Different forms of &quot;property&quot; require different amounts of enforcement: intellectual property requires a great deal of state intervention to enforce, ownership of distant physical property requires quite a lot, ownership of carried objects requires very little. In contrast, requesting one&#x27;s own body requires absolutely no state intervention. So some anarchists don&#x27;t believe in property at all.

Many things have existed that did not have an owner, sometimes called the commons. The term &quot;commons,&quot; however, is also often used to mean something entirely different: &quot;general collective ownership&quot;—i.e. common ownership. Also, the same term is sometimes used by statists to mean government-owned property that the general public is allowed to access (public property). Law in all societies has tended to reduce the number of things not having clear owners. Supporters of property rights argue that this enables better protection of scarce resources due to the tragedy of the commons. At the same time, critics say that it leads to the &#x27;exploitation&#x27; of those resources for personal gain and that it hinders taking advantage of potential network effects. These arguments have differing validity for different types of &quot;property&quot;—things that are not scarce are, for instance, not subject to the tragedy of the commons. Some apparent critics advocate general collective ownership rather than ownerlessness.

Things that do not have owners include: ideas (except for intellectual property), seawater (which is, however, protected by anti-pollution laws), parts of the seafloor (see the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for restrictions), gases in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, animals in the wild (although in most nations, animals are tied to the land. In the United States and Canada, wildlife is generally defined in statute as property of the State. This public ownership of wildlife is referred to as the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation and is based on The Public Trust Doctrine.), celestial bodies and outer space, and land in Antarctica.

The nature of children under the age of majority is another contested issue here. In ancient societies, children were generally considered the property of their parents. However, children in most modern communities theoretically own their bodies but are not regarded as competent to exercise their rights. Their parents or guardians are given most of the fundamental rights of control over them.

Questions regarding the nature of ownership of the body also come up in the issue of abortion, drugs, and euthanasia.

In many ancient legal systems (e.g., early Roman law), religious sites (e.g. temples) were considered property of the God or gods they were devoted to. However, religious pluralism makes it more convenient to have sacred sites owned by the spiritual body that runs them.

Intellectual property and air (airspace, no-fly zone, pollution laws, which can include tradable emissions rights) can be property in some senses of the word.

Ownership of land can be held separately from the ownership of rights over that land, including sporting rights, mineral rights, development rights, air rights, and such other rights as may be worth segregating from simple land ownership.

=== Ownership ===

Ownership laws may vary widely among countries depending on the nature of the property of interest (e.g., firearms, real property, personal property, animals). Persons can own property directly. In most societies legal entities, such as corporations, trusts and nations (or governments) own property.

In many countries women have limited access to property following restrictive inheritance and family laws, under which only men have actual or formal rights to own property.

In the Inca empire, the dead emperors, considered gods, still controlled property after death.

=== Government interference ===
In 17th-century England, the legal directive that nobody may enter a home (which in the 17th century would typically have been male-owned) unless by the owner&#x27;s invitation or consent, was established as common law in Sir Edward Coke &#x27;s &quot;Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot;. &quot;For a man&#x27;s house is his castle, et domus sua cuique est tutissimum refugium [and each man&#x27;s home is his safest refuge].&quot; It is the origin of the famous dictum, &quot;an Englishman&#x27;s home is his castle&quot;. The ruling enshrined into law what several English writers had espoused in the 16th century. Unlike the rest of Europe the British had a proclivity towards owning their own homes. British Prime Minister William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham defined the meaning of castle in 1763, &quot;The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the crown. It may be frail – its roof may shake – the wind may blow through it – the storm may enter – the rain may enter – but the King of England cannot enter.&quot;

That principle was carried to the United States. Under U.S. law, the principal limitations on whether and the extent to which the State may interfere with property rights are set by the Constitution. The Takings clause requires that the government (whether State or federal—for the 14th Amendment&#x27;s due process clause imposes the 5th Amendment&#x27;s takings clause on state governments) may take private property only for a public purpose after exercising due process of law, and upon making &quot;just compensation.&quot; If an interest is not deemed a &quot;property&quot; right or the conduct is merely an intentional tort, these limitations do not apply, and the doctrine of sovereign immunity precludes relief. Moreover, if the interference does not almost completely make the property valueless, the interference will not be deemed a taking but instead a mere regulation of use. On the other hand, some governmental regulations of property use have been deemed so severe that they have been considered &quot;regulatory takings.&quot; Moreover, conduct is sometimes deemed only a nuisance, or another tort has been held a taking of property where the conduct was sufficiently persistent and severe.

== Theories ==
There exist many theories of property. One is the relatively rare first possession theory of property, where ownership of something is seen as justified simply by someone seizing something before someone else does. Perhaps one of the most popular is the natural rights definition of property rights as advanced by John Locke. Locke advanced the theory that God granted dominion over nature to man through Adam in the book of Genesis. Therefore, he theorized that when one mixes one&#x27;s labor with nature, one gains a relationship with that part of nature with which the labor is mixed, subject to the limitation that there should be &quot;enough, and as good, left in common for others.&quot; (see Lockean proviso)

In his encyclical letter &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; (1891), Pope Leo XIII wrote, &quot;It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor, the impelling reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and after that to hold it as his very own.&quot;

Anthropology studies the diverse ownership systems, rights of use and transfer, and possession under the term &quot;theories of property&quot;. As mentioned, western legal theory is based on the owner of property being a legal person. However, not all property systems are founded on this basis.

In every culture studied, ownership and possession are the subjects of custom and regulation, and &quot;law&quot; is where the term can meaningfully be applied. Many tribal cultures balance individual rights with the laws of collective groups: tribes, families, associations, and nations. For example, the 1839 Cherokee Constitution frames the issue in these terms:

Communal property systems describe ownership as belonging to the entire social and political unit. Common ownership in a hypothetical communist society is distinguished from primitive forms of common property that have existed throughout history, such as Communalism and primitive communism, in that communist common ownership is the outcome of social and technological developments leading to the elimination of material scarcity in society.

Corporate systems describe ownership as being attached to an identifiable group with an identifiable responsible individual. The Roman property law was based on such a corporate system. In a well-known paper that contributed to the creation of the field of law and economics in the late 1960s, the American scholar Harold Demsetz described how the concept of property rights makes social interactions easier:

Different societies may have other theories of property for differing types of ownership. For example, Pauline Peters argued that property systems are not isolable from the social fabric, and notions of property may not be stated as such but instead may be framed in negative terms: for example, the taboo system among Polynesian peoples.

== Property in philosophy ==
In medieval and Renaissance Europe the term &quot;property&quot; essentially referred to land. After much rethinking, land has come to be regarded as only a special case of the property genus. This rethinking was inspired by at least three broad features of early modern Europe: the surge of commerce, the breakdown of efforts to prohibit interest (then called &quot;usury&quot;), and the development of centralized national monarchies.

=== Ancient philosophy ===
Urukagina, the king of the Sumerian city-state Lagash, established the first laws that forbade compelling the sale of property.

The Bible in Leviticus 19:11 and ibid. 19:13 states that the Israelites are not to steal.

Aristotle, in &quot;Politics,&quot; advocates &quot;private property.&quot; He argues that self-interest leads to neglect of the commons. &quot;[T]hat which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it. Everyone thinks chiefly of his own, hardly at all of the common interest, and only when he is himself concerned as an individual.&quot;

In addition, he says that when property is common, there are natural problems that arise due to differences in labor: &quot;If they do not share equally enjoyments and toils, those who labor much and get little will necessarily complain of those who labor little and receive or consume much. But indeed, there is always a difficulty in men living together and having all human relations in common, but especially in their having common property.&quot; (&quot;Politics, 1261b34&quot;)

Cicero held that there is no private property under natural law but only under human law. Seneca viewed property as only becoming necessary when men become avaricious. St. Ambrose later adopted this view and St. Augustine even derided heretics for complaining the Emperor could not confiscate property they had labored for.

=== Medieval philosophy ===

==== Thomas Aquinas (13th century) ====
The canon law &quot;Decretum Gratiani&quot; maintained that mere human law creates property, repeating the phrases used by St. Augustine. St. Thomas Aquinas agreed with regard to the private consumption of property but modified patristic theory in finding that the private possession of property is necessary. Thomas Aquinas concludes that, given certain detailed provisions,
* it is natural for man to possess external things
* it is lawful for a man to possess a thing as his own
* The essence of theft consists in taking another&#x27;s thing secretly
* Theft and robbery are sins of different species, and robbery is a more grievous sin than theft
* theft is a sin; it is also a mortal sin
* it is, however, lawful to steal through stress of need:&quot; in cases of need, all things are common property.&quot;

===Modern philosophy===

==== Thomas Hobbes (17th century) ====
The principal writings of Thomas Hobbes appeared between 1640 and 1651—during and immediately following the war between forces loyal to King Charles I and those loyal to Parliament. In his own words, Hobbes&#x27; reflection began with the idea of &quot;giving to every man his own,&quot; a phrase he drew from the writings of Cicero. But he wondered: How can anybody call anything his own?

==== James Harrington (17th century) ====

A contemporary of Hobbes, James Harrington, reacted to the same tumult differently: he considered property natural but not inevitable. The author of &quot;Oceana,&quot; he may have been the first political theorist to postulate that political power is a consequence, not the cause, of the distribution of property. He said that the worst possible situation is when the commoners have half a nation&#x27;s property, with the crown and nobility holding the other half—a circumstance fraught with instability and violence. He suggested a much better situation (a stable republic) would exist once the commoners own most property.

In later years, the ranks of Harrington&#x27;s admirers included American revolutionary and founder John Adams.

==== Robert Filmer (17th century) ====

Another member of the Hobbes/Harrington generation, Sir Robert Filmer, reached conclusions much like Hobbes&#x27;, but through Biblical exegesis. Filmer said that the institution of kingship is analogous to that of fatherhood, that subjects are still, children, whether obedient or unruly and that property rights are akin to the household goods that a father may dole out among his children—his to take back and dispose of according to his pleasure.

==== John Locke (17th century) ====

In the following generation, John Locke sought to answer Filmer, creating a rationale for a balanced constitution in which the monarch had a part to play, but not an overwhelming part. Since Filmer&#x27;s views essentially require that the Stuart family be uniquely descended from the patriarchs of the Bible, and even in the late 17th century, that was a difficult view to uphold, Locke attacked Filmer&#x27;s views in his First Treatise on Government, freeing him to set out his own views in the Second Treatise on Civil Government. Therein, Locke imagined a pre-social world each of the unhappy residents which are willing to create a social contract because otherwise, &quot;the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very insecure,&quot; and therefore, the &quot;great and chief end, therefore, of men&#x27;s uniting into commonwealths, and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property.&quot; They would, he allowed, create a monarchy, but its task would be to execute the will of an elected legislature. &quot;To this end&quot; (to achieve the previously specified goal), he wrote, &quot;it is that men give up all their natural power to the society they enter into, and the community put the Legislative power into such hands as they think fit, with this trust, that they shall be governed by declared laws, or else their peace, quiet, and property will still be at the same uncertainty as it was in the state of nature.&quot;

Even when it keeps to proper legislative form, Locke held that there are limits to what a government established by such a contract might rightly do.

 &quot;It cannot be supposed that [the hypothetical contractors] they should intend, had they a power so to do, to give anyone or more an absolute arbitrary power over their persons and estates, and put a force into the magistrate&#x27;s hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily upon them; this were to put themselves into a worse condition than the State of nature, wherein they had a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others, and were upon equal terms of force to maintain it, whether invaded by a single man or many in combination. Whereas by supposing they have given themselves up to the absolute arbitrary power and will of a legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him to make a prey of them when he pleases...&quot;

Both &quot;persons&quot; and &quot;estates&quot; are to be protected from the arbitrary power of any magistrate, including legislative power and will.&quot; In Lockean terms, depredations against an estate are just as plausible a justification for resistance and revolution as are those against persons. In neither case are subjects required to allow themselves to become prey.

To explain the ownership of property, Locke advanced a labor theory of property.

==== David Hume (18th century) ====

In contrast to the figures discussed in this section thus far David Hume lived a relatively quiet life that had settled down to a relatively stable social and political structure. He lived the life of a solitary writer until 1763 when, at 52 years of age, he went off to Paris to work at the British embassy.

In contrast, one might think to his polemical works on religion and his empiricism-driven skeptical epistemology, Hume&#x27;s views on law and property were quite conservative.

He did not believe in hypothetical contracts or the love of humanity in general and sought to ground politics upon actual human beings as one knows them. &quot;In general,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it may be affirmed that there is no such passion in the human mind, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal qualities, or services, or of relation to ourselves.&quot; Existing customs should not lightly be disregarded because they have come to be what they are due to human nature. With this endorsement of custom comes an endorsement of existing governments because he conceived of the two as complementary: &quot;A regard for liberty, though a laudable passion, ought commonly to be subordinate to a reverence for established government.&quot;

Therefore, Hume&#x27;s view was that there are property rights because of and to the extent that the existing law, supported by social customs, secure them. He offered some practical home-spun advice on the general subject, though, as when he referred to avarice as &quot;the spur of industry,&quot; and expressed concern about excessive levels of taxation, which &quot;destroy industry, by engendering despair.&quot;

====Adam Smith====
&quot;The property that every man has in his labour is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable. The inheritance of a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his hands, and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without injury to his neighbor, is a plain violation of this most sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment upon the just liberty of the workman and those who might be disposed to employ him. It hinders the one from working at what he thinks proper, so it hinders the others from employing whom they think proper. To judge whether he is fit to be employed may surely be trusted to the discretion of the employers whose interest it so much concerns. The affected anxiety of the law-giver lest they should employ an improper person is as impertinent as it is oppressive.&quot;
— (Source: Adam Smith, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, 1776, Book I, Chapter X, Part II.)

By the mid 19th century, the industrial revolution had transformed England and the United States and had begun in France. As a result, the conventional conception of what constitutes property expanded beyond land to encompass scarce goods. In France, the revolution of the 1790s had led to large-scale confiscation of land formerly owned by the church and king. The restoration of the monarchy led to claims by those dispossessed to have their former lands returned.

====Karl Marx====

Section VIII, &quot;Primitive Accumulation&quot; of Capital involves a critique of Liberal Theories of property rights. Marx notes that under Feudal Law, peasants were legally entitled to their land as the aristocracy was to its manors. Marx cites several historical events in which large numbers of the peasantry were removed from their lands, then seized by the nobility. This seized land was then used for commercial ventures (sheep herding). Marx sees this &quot;Primitive Accumulation&quot; as integral to the creation of English Capitalism. This event created a sizeable un-landed class that had to work for wages to survive. Marx asserts that liberal theories of property are &quot;idyllic&quot; fairy tales that hide a violent historical process.

==== Charles Comte: legitimate origin of property ====

Charles Comte, in &quot;Traité de la propriété&quot; (1834), attempted to justify the legitimacy of private property in response to the Bourbon Restoration. According to David Hart, Comte had three main points: &quot;firstly, that interference by the state over the centuries in property ownership has had dire consequences for justice as well as for economic productivity; secondly, that property is legitimate when it emerges in such a way as not to harm anyone; and thirdly, that historically some, but by no means all, property which has evolved has done so legitimately, with the implication that the present distribution of property is a complex mixture of legitimately and illegitimately held titles.&quot;

Comte, as Proudhon later did, rejected Roman legal tradition with its toleration of slavery. Instead, he posited a communal &quot;national&quot; property consisting of non-scarce goods, such as land in ancient hunter-gatherer societies. Since agriculture was so much more efficient than hunting and gathering, private property appropriated by someone for farming left remaining hunter-gatherers with more land per person and hence did not harm them. Thus this type of land appropriation did not violate the Lockean proviso – there was &quot;still enough, and as good left.&quot; Later theorists would use Comte&#x27;s analysis in response to the socialist critique of property.

==== Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: property is theft ====
In his 1840 treatise &quot;What is Property?&quot;, Pierre Proudhon answers with &quot;Property is theft!&quot;. In natural resources, he sees two types of property, &quot;de jure&quot; property (legal title) and &quot;de facto&quot; property (physical possession), and argues that the former is illegitimate. Proudhon&#x27;s conclusion is that &quot;property, to be just and possible, must necessarily have equality for its condition.&quot;

His analysis of the product of labor upon natural resources as property (usufruct) is more nuanced. He asserts that land itself cannot be property, yet it should be held by individual possessors as stewards of humanity, with the product of labor being the producer&#x27;s property. Proudhon reasoned that any wealth gained without labor was stolen from those who labored to create that wealth. Even a voluntary contract to surrender the product of work to an employer was theft, according to Proudhon, since the controller of natural resources had no moral right to charge others for the use of that which he did not labor to create did not own.

Proudhon&#x27;s theory of property greatly influenced the budding socialist movement, inspiring anarchist theorists such as Mikhail Bakunin who modified Proudhon&#x27;s ideas, as well as antagonizing theorists like Karl Marx.

==== Frédéric Bastiat: property is value ====

Frédéric Bastiat &#x27;s main treatise on property can be found in chapter 8 of his book &quot;Economic Harmonies&quot; (1850). In a radical departure from traditional property theory, he defines property, not as a physical object, but rather as a relationship between people concerning a thing. Thus, saying one owns a glass of water is merely verbal shorthand for &quot;I may justly gift or trade this water to another person.&quot; In essence, what one owns is not the object but the object&#x27;s value. By &quot;value,&quot; Bastiat means &quot;market value&quot;; he emphasizes this is quite different from utility. &quot;In our relations with one another, we are not owners of the utility of things, but their value, and value is the appraisal made of reciprocal services.&quot;

Bastiat theorized that, as a result of technological progress and the division of labor, the stock of communal wealth increases over time; that the hours of work an unskilled laborer expends to buy e.g., 100 liters of wheat, decreases over time, thus amounting to &quot;gratis&quot; satisfaction. Thus, private property continually destroys itself, becoming transformed into communal wealth. The increasing proportion of communal wealth to private property results in a tendency toward equality of humanity. &quot;Since the human race began in greatest poverty, that is, when there were the most obstacles to overcome, all that has been achieved from one era to the next is due to the spirit of property.&quot;

This transformation of private property into the communal domain, Bastiat points out, does not imply that personal property will ever totally disappear. On the contrary, this is because man, as he progresses, continually invents new and more sophisticated needs and desires.

==== Andrew J. Galambos: a precise definition of property ====

Andrew J. Galambos (1924–1997) was an astrophysicist and philosopher who innovated a social structure that sought to maximize human peace and freedom. Galambos&#x27; concept of property was essential to his philosophy. He defined property as a man&#x27;s life and all non-procreative derivatives of his life. (Because the English language is deficient in omitting the feminine from &quot;man&quot; when referring to humankind, it is implicit and obligatory that the feminine is included in the term &quot;man.&quot;)

Galambos taught that property is essential to a non-coercive social structure. He defined freedom as follows: &quot;Freedom is the societal condition that exists when every individual has full (100%) control over his property.&quot; Galambos defines property as having the following elements:
* Primordial property, which is an individual&#x27;s life
* Primary property, which includes ideas, thoughts, and actions
* Secondary property includes all tangible and intangible possessions that are derivatives of the individual&#x27;s primary property.

Property includes all non-procreative derivatives of an individual&#x27;s life; this means children are not the property of their parents. and &quot;primary property&quot; (a person&#x27;s own ideas).

Galambos repeatedly emphasized that actual government exists to protect property and that the State attacks property.
For example, the State requires payment for its services in the form of taxes whether or not people desire such services. Since an individual&#x27;s money is his property, the confiscation of money in the form of taxes is an attack on property. Military conscription is likewise an attack on a person&#x27;s primordial property.

===Contemporary views===

Contemporary political thinkers who believe that natural persons enjoy rights to own property and enter into contracts espouse two views about John Locke. On the one hand, some admire Locke, such as William H. Hutt (1956), who praised Locke for laying down the &quot;quintessence of individualism.&quot; On the other hand, those such as Richard Pipes regard Locke&#x27;s arguments as weak and think that undue reliance thereon has weakened the cause of individualism in recent times. Pipes has written that Locke&#x27;s work &quot;marked a regression because it rested on the concept of Natural Law&quot; rather than upon Harrington&#x27;s sociological framework.

Hernando de Soto has argued that an essential characteristic of the capitalist market economy is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system which records ownership and transactions. These property rights and the whole legal system of property make possible:
* Greater independence for individuals from local community arrangements to protect their assets
* Clear, provable, and protectable ownership
* The standardization and integration of property rules and property information in a country as a whole
* Increased trust arising from a greater certainty of punishment for cheating in economic transactions
* More formal and complex written statements of ownership that permit the more straightforward assumption of shared risk and ownership in companies, and insurance against the risk
* Greater availability of loans for new projects since more things can serve as collateral for the loans
* Easier access to and more reliable information regarding such things as credit history and the worth of assets
* Increased fungibility, standardization, and transferability of statements documenting the ownership of property, which paves the way for structures such as national markets for companies and the easy transportation of property through complex networks of individuals and other entities
* Greater protection of biodiversity due to minimizing of shifting agriculture practices

According to de Soto, all of the above enhance economic growth. Academics have criticized the capitalist frame through which property is viewed pointing to the fact that commodifying property or land by assigning it monetary value takes away from the traditional cultural heritage, particularly from first nation inhabitants. These academics point to the personal nature of property and its link to identity being irreconcilable with wealth creation that contemporary Western society subscribes to.

<text>The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state with the aim of enforcing the law and protecting the public order as well as the public itself. This commonly includes ensuring the safety, health, and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder. Their lawful powers encompass arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence. The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes.

Law enforcement is only part of policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property. Police forces have become ubiquitous and a necessity in complex modern societies. However, their role can sometimes be controversial, as they may be involved to varying degrees in corruption, brutality, and the enforcement of authoritarian rule.

A police force may also be referred to as a police department, police service, constabulary, gendarmerie, crime prevention, protective services, law enforcement agency, civil guard, or civic guard. Members may be referred to as police officers, troopers, sheriffs, constables, rangers, peace officers or civic/civil guards. Ireland differs from other English-speaking countries by using the Irish language terms &quot;Garda&quot; (singular) and &quot;Gardaí&quot; (plural), for both the national police force and its members. The word &quot;police&quot; is the most universal and similar terms can be seen in many non-English speaking countries.

Numerous slang terms exist for the police. Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymologies. One of the oldest, &quot;cop&quot;, has largely lost its slang connotations and become a common colloquial term used both by the public and police officers to refer to their profession.

==Etymology==
First attested in English in the early 15th century, originally in a range of senses encompassing &#x27;(public) policy; state; public order&#x27;, the word &quot;police&quot; comes from Middle French (&#x27;public order, administration, government&#x27;), in turn from Latin , which is the romanization of the Ancient Greek () &#x27;citizenship, administration, civil polity&#x27;. This is derived from () &#x27;city&#x27;.

==History==
===Ancient===

==== China ====
Law enforcement in ancient China was carried out by &quot;prefects&quot; for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period. In Jin, dozens of prefects were spread across the state, each having limited authority and employment period. They were appointed by local magistrates, who reported to higher authorities such as governors, who in turn were appointed by the emperor, and they oversaw the civil administration of their &quot;prefecture&quot;, or jurisdiction. Under each prefect were &quot;subprefects&quot; who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area. Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations, much like modern police detectives. Prefects could also be women. Local citizens could report minor judicial offenses against them such as robberies at a local prefectural office. The concept of the &quot;prefecture system&quot; spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan.

==== Babylonia ====
In Babylonia, law enforcement tasks were initially entrusted to individuals with military backgrounds or imperial magnates during the Old Babylonian period, but eventually, law enforcement was delegated to officers known as , who were present in both cities and rural settlements. A was responsible for investigating petty crimes and carrying out arrests.

====Egypt ====
In ancient Egypt evidence of law enforcement exists as far back as the Old Kingdom period. There are records of an office known as &quot;Judge Commandant of the Police&quot; dating to the fourth dynasty. During the fifth dynasty at the end of the Old Kingdom period, warriors armed with wooden sticks were tasked with guarding public places such as markets, temples, and parks, and apprehending criminals. They are known to have made use of trained monkeys, baboons, and dogs in guard duties and catching criminals. After the Old Kingdom collapsed, ushering in the First Intermediate Period, it is thought that the same model applied. During this period, Bedouins were hired to guard the borders and protect trade caravans. During the Middle Kingdom period, a professional police force was created with a specific focus on enforcing the law, as opposed to the previous informal arrangement of using warriors as police. The police force was further reformed during the New Kingdom period. Police officers served as interrogators, prosecutors, and court bailiffs, and were responsible for administering punishments handed down by judges. In addition, there were special units of police officers trained as priests who were responsible for guarding temples and tombs and preventing inappropriate behavior at festivals or improper observation of religious rites during services. Other police units were tasked with guarding caravans, guarding border crossings, protecting royal necropolises, guarding slaves at work or during transport, patrolling the Nile River, and guarding administrative buildings. By the Eighteenth Dynasty of the New Kingdom period, an elite desert-ranger police force called the Medjay was used to protect valuable areas, especially areas of pharaonic interest like capital cities, royal cemeteries, and the borders of Egypt. Though they are best known for their protection of the royal palaces and tombs in Thebes and the surrounding areas, the Medjay were used throughout Upper and Lower Egypt. Each regional unit had its own captain. The police forces of ancient Egypt did not guard rural communities, which often took care of their own judicial problems by appealing to village elders, but many of them had a constable to enforce state laws.

==== Greece ====
In ancient Greece, publicly owned slaves were used by magistrates as police. In Athens, the Scythian Archers (the &#x27;rod-bearers&#x27;), a group of about 300 Scythian slaves, was used to guard public meetings to keep order and for crowd control, and also assisted with dealing with criminals, handling prisoners, and making arrests. Other duties associated with modern policing, such as investigating crimes, were left to the citizens themselves. Athenian police forces were supervised by the Areopagus. In Sparta, the Ephors were in charge of maintaining public order as judges, and they used Sparta&#x27;s Hippeis, a 300-member Royal guard of honor, as their enforcers. There were separate authorities supervising women, children, and agricultural issues. Sparta also had a secret police force called the crypteia to watch the large population of helots, or slaves.

==== Rome ====
In the Roman Empire, the army played a major role in providing security. Roman soldiers detached from their legions and posted among civilians carried out law enforcement tasks. The Praetorian Guard, an elite army unit which was primarily an Imperial bodyguard and intelligence-gathering unit, could also act as a riot police force if required. Local watchmen were hired by cities to provide some extra security. Lictors, civil servants whose primary duty was to act as bodyguards to magistrates who held &quot;imperium&quot;, could carry out arrests and inflict punishments at their magistrate&#x27;s command. Magistrates such as &quot;tresviri capitales&quot;, and investigated crimes. There was no concept of public prosecution, so victims of crime or their families had to organize and manage the prosecution themselves. Under the reign of Augustus, when the capital had grown to almost one million inhabitants, 14 wards were created; the wards were protected by seven squads of 1,000 men called , who acted as night watchmen and firemen. In addition to firefighting, their duties included apprehending petty criminals, capturing runaway slaves, guarding the baths at night, and stopping disturbances of the peace. As well as the city of Rome, &quot;vigiles&quot; were also stationed in the harbor cities of Ostia and Portus. Augustus also formed the Urban Cohorts to deal with gangs and civil disturbances in the city of Rome, and as a counterbalance to the Praetorian Guard&#x27;s enormous power in the city. They were led by the urban prefect. Urban Cohort units were later formed in Roman Carthage and Lugdunum.

==== India ====
Law enforcement systems existed in the various kingdoms and empires of ancient India. The Apastamba Dharmasutra prescribes that kings should appoint officers and subordinates in the towns and villages to protect their subjects from crime. Various inscriptions and literature from ancient India suggest that a variety of roles existed for law enforcement officials such as those of a constable, thief catcher, watchman, and detective. In ancient India up to medieval and early modern times, kotwals were in charge of local law enforcement.

==== Achaemenid (First Persian) Empire ====
The Achaemenid Empire had well-organized police forces. A police force existed in every place of importance. In the cities, each ward was under the command of a Superintendent of Police, known as a . Police officers also acted as prosecutors and carried out punishments imposed by the courts. They were required to know the court procedure for prosecuting cases and advancing accusations.

==== Israel ====
In ancient Israel and Judah, officials with the responsibility of making declarations to the people, guarding the king&#x27;s person, supervising public works, and executing the orders of the courts existed in the urban areas. They are repeatedly mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, and this system lasted into the period of Roman rule. The first century Jewish historian Josephus related that every judge had two such officers under his command. Levites were preferred for this role. Cities and towns also had night watchmen. Besides officers of the town, there were officers for every tribe. The temple in Jerusalem had special temple police to guard it. The Talmud mentions various local police officials in the Jewish communities of the Land of Israel and Babylon who supervised economic activity. Their Greek-sounding titles suggest that the roles were introduced under Hellenic influence. Most of these officials received their authority from local courts and their salaries were drawn from the town treasury. The Talmud also mentions city watchmen and mounted and armed watchmen in the suburbs.

==== Africa ====
In many regions of pre-colonial Africa, particularly West and Central Africa, guild-like secret societies emerged as law enforcement. In the absence of a court system or written legal code, they carried out police-like activities, employing varying degrees of coercion to enforce conformity and deter antisocial behavior. In ancient Ethiopia, armed retainers of the nobility enforced law in the countryside according to the will of their leaders. The Songhai Empire had officials known as &quot;assara-munidios&quot;, or &quot;enforcers&quot;, acting as police.

==== The Americas ====
Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas also had organized law enforcement. The city-states of the Maya civilization had constables known as . In the Aztec Empire, judges had officers serving under them who were empowered to perform arrests, even of dignitaries. In the Inca Empire, officials called enforced the law among the households they were assigned to oversee, with inspectors known as () also stationed throughout the provinces to keep order.

===Post-classical===

In medieval Spain, , or &#x27;holy brotherhoods&#x27;, peacekeeping associations of armed individuals, were a characteristic of municipal life, especially in Castile. As medieval Spanish kings often could not offer adequate protection, protective municipal leagues began to emerge in the twelfth century against banditry and other rural criminals, and against the lawless nobility or to support one or another claimant to a crown.

These organizations were intended to be temporary, but became a long-standing fixture of Spain. The first recorded case of the formation of an occurred when the towns and the peasantry of the north united to police the pilgrim road to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, and protect the pilgrims against robber knights.

Throughout the Middle Ages such alliances were frequently formed by combinations of towns to protect the roads connecting them, and were occasionally extended to political purposes. Among the most powerful was the league of North Castilian and Basque ports, the Hermandad de las marismas: Toledo, Talavera, and Villarreal.

As one of their first acts after end of the War of the Castilian Succession in 1479, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile established the centrally-organized and efficient &quot;Holy Brotherhood&quot; as a national police force. They adapted an existing brotherhood to the purpose of a general police acting under officials appointed by themselves, and endowed with great powers of summary jurisdiction even in capital cases. The original brotherhoods continued to serve as modest local police-units until their final suppression in 1835.

The Vehmic courts of Germany provided some policing in the absence of strong state institutions. Such courts had a chairman who presided over a session and lay judges who passed judgement and carried out law enforcement tasks. Among the responsibilities that lay judges had were giving formal warnings to known troublemakers, issuing warrants, and carrying out executions.

In the medieval Islamic Caliphates, police were known as . Bodies termed existed perhaps as early as the Caliphate of Uthman. The &quot;Shurta&quot; is known to have existed in the Abbasid and Umayyad Caliphates. Their primary roles were to act as police and internal security forces but they could also be used for other duties such as customs and tax enforcement, rubbish collection, and acting as bodyguards for governors. From the 10th century, the importance of the &quot;Shurta&quot; declined as the army assumed internal security tasks while cities became more autonomous and handled their own policing needs locally, such as by hiring watchmen. In addition, officials called were responsible for supervising bazaars and economic activity in general in the medieval Islamic world.

In France during the Middle Ages, there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities: The Marshal of France and the Grand Constable of France. The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal&#x27;s provost, whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal. The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century. Another organisation, the Constabulary (), was under the command of the Constable of France. The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337. Under Francis I (reigned 1515–1547), the was merged with the constabulary. The resulting force was also known as the , or, formally, the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France.

In late medieval Italian cities, police forces were known as &quot;berovierri&quot;. Individually, their members were known as &quot;birri&quot;. Subordinate to the city&#x27;s podestà, the &quot;berovierri&quot; were responsible for guarding the cities and their suburbs, patrolling, and the pursuit and arrest of criminals. They were typically hired on short-term contracts, usually six months. Detailed records from medieval Bologna show that &quot;birri&quot; had a chain of command, with constables and sergeants managing lower-ranking &quot;birri&quot;, that they wore uniforms, that they were housed together with other employees of the podestà together with a number of servants including cooks and stable-keepers, that their parentage and places of origin were meticulously recorded, and that most were not native to Bologna, with many coming from outside Italy.

The English system of maintaining public order since the Norman conquest was a private system of tithings known as the mutual pledge system. This system was introduced under Alfred the Great. Communities were divided into groups of ten families called tithings, each of which was overseen by a chief tithingman. Every household head was responsible for the good behavior of his own family and the good behavior of other members of his tithing. Every male aged 12 and over was required to participate in a tithing. Members of tithings were responsible for raising &quot;hue and cry&quot; upon witnessing or learning of a crime, and the men of his tithing were responsible for capturing the criminal. The person the tithing captured would then be brought before the chief tithingman, who would determine guilt or innocence and punishment. All members of the criminal&#x27;s tithing would be responsible for paying the fine. A group of ten tithings was known as a &quot;hundred&quot; and every hundred was overseen by an official known as a reeve. Hundreds ensured that if a criminal escaped to a neighboring village, he could be captured and returned to his village. If a criminal was not apprehended, then the entire hundred could be fined. The hundreds were governed by administrative divisions known as shires, the rough equivalent of a modern county, which were overseen by an official known as a shire-reeve, from which the term sheriff evolved. The shire-reeve had the power of , meaning he could gather the men of his shire to pursue a criminal. Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the tithing system was tightened with the frankpledge system. By the end of the 13th century, the office of constable developed. Constables had the same responsibilities as chief tithingmen and additionally as royal officers. The constable was elected by his parish every year. Eventually, constables became the first &#x27;police&#x27; official to be tax-supported. In urban areas, watchmen were tasked with keeping order and enforcing nighttime curfew. Watchmen guarded the town gates at night, patrolled the streets, arrested those on the streets at night without good reason, and also acted as firefighters. Eventually the office of justice of the peace was established, with a justice of the peace overseeing constables. There was also a system of investigative &quot;juries&quot;.

The Assize of Arms of 1252, which required the appointment of constables to summon men to arms, quell breaches of the peace, and to deliver offenders to the sheriff or reeve, is cited as one of the earliest antecedents of the English police. The Statute of Winchester of 1285 is also cited as the primary legislation regulating the policing of the country between the Norman Conquest and the Metropolitan Police Act 1829.

From about 1500, private watchmen were funded by private individuals and organisations to carry out police functions. They were later nicknamed &#x27;Charlies&#x27;, probably after the reigning monarch King Charles II. Thief-takers were also rewarded for catching thieves and returning the stolen property. They were private individuals usually hired by crime victims.

The earliest English use of the word &quot;police&quot; seems to have been the term &quot;Polles&quot; mentioned in the book &quot;The Second Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot; published in 1642.

===Early modern===
The first example of a statutory police force in the world was probably the High Constables of Edinburgh, formed in 1611 to police the streets of Edinburgh, then part of the Kingdom of Scotland. The constables, of whom half were merchants and half were craftsmen, were charged with enforcing 16 regulations relating to curfews, weapons, and theft. At that time, maintenance of public order in Scotland was mainly done by clan chiefs and feudal lords. The first centrally organised and uniformed police force was created by the government of King Louis XIV in 1667 to police the city of Paris, then the largest city in Europe. The royal edict, registered by the of Paris on March 15, 1667, created the office of (&quot;lieutenant general of police&quot;), who was to be the head of the new Paris police force, and defined the task of the police as &quot;ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals, purging the city of what may cause disturbances, procuring abundance, and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties&quot;.
This office was first held by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, who had 44 (&#x27;police commissioners&#x27;) under his authority. In 1709, these commissioners were assisted by (&#x27;police inspectors&#x27;). The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the , each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy. The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699, resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities and towns.

After the French Revolution, Napoléon I reorganized the police in Paris and other cities with more than 5,000 inhabitants on February 17, 1800, as the Prefecture of Police. On March 12, 1829, a government decree created the first uniformed police in France, known as (&#x27;city sergeants&#x27;), which the Paris Prefecture of Police&#x27;s website claims were the first uniformed policemen in the world.

In feudal Japan, samurai warriors were charged with enforcing the law among commoners. Some Samurai acted as magistrates called , who acted as judges, prosecutors, and as chief of police. Beneath them were other Samurai serving as , or assistant magistrates, who conducted criminal investigations, and beneath them were Samurai serving as , who were responsible for patrolling the streets, keeping the peace, and making arrests when necessary. The were responsible for managing the . and were typically drawn from low-ranking samurai families. Assisting the were the , non-Samurai who went on patrol with them and provided assistance, the , non-Samurai from the lowest outcast class, often former criminals, who worked for them as informers and spies, and or , chōnin, often former criminals, who were hired by local residents and merchants to work as police assistants in a particular neighborhood. This system typically did not apply to the Samurai themselves. Samurai clans were expected to resolve disputes among each other through negotiation, or when that failed through duels. Only rarely did Samurai bring their disputes to a magistrate or answer to police.

In Joseon-era Korea, the Podocheong emerged as a police force with the power to arrest and punish criminals. Established in 1469 as a temporary organization, its role solidified into a permanent one.

In Sweden, local governments were responsible for law and order by way of a royal decree issued by Magnus III in the 13th century. The cities financed and organized groups of watchmen who patrolled the streets. In the late 1500s in Stockholm, patrol duties were in large part taken over by a special corps of salaried city guards. The city guard was organized, uniformed and armed like a military unit and was responsible for interventions against various crimes and the arrest of suspected criminals. These guards were assisted by the military, fire patrolmen, and a civilian unit that did not wear a uniform, but instead wore a small badge around the neck. The civilian unit monitored compliance with city ordinances relating to e.g. sanitation issues, traffic and taxes. In rural areas, the King&#x27;s bailiffs were responsible for law and order until the establishment of counties in the 1630s.

Up to the early 18th century, the level of state involvement in law enforcement in Britain was low. Although some law enforcement officials existed in the form of constables and watchmen, there was no organized police force. A professional police force like the one already present in France would have been ill-suited to Britain, which saw examples such as the French one as a threat to the people&#x27;s liberty and balanced constitution in favor of an arbitrary and tyrannical government. Law enforcement was mostly up to the private citizens, who had the right and duty to prosecute crimes in which they were involved or in which they were not. At the cry of &#x27;murder!&#x27; or &#x27;stop thief!&#x27; everyone was entitled and obliged to join the pursuit. Once the criminal had been apprehended, the parish constables and night watchmen, who were the only public figures provided by the state and who were typically part-time and local, would make the arrest. As a result, the state set a reward to encourage citizens to arrest and prosecute offenders. The first of such rewards was established in 1692 of the amount of £40 for the conviction of a highwayman and in the following years it was extended to burglars, coiners and other forms of offense. The reward was to be increased in 1720 when, after the end of the War of the Spanish Succession and the consequent rise of criminal offenses, the government offered £100 for the conviction of a highwayman. Although the offer of such a reward was conceived as an incentive for the victims of an offense to proceed to the prosecution and to bring criminals to justice, the efforts of the government also increased the number of private thief-takers. Thief-takers became infamously known not so much for what they were supposed to do, catching real criminals and prosecuting them, as for &quot;setting themselves up as intermediaries between victims and their attackers, extracting payments for the return of stolen goods and using the threat of prosecution to keep offenders in thrall&quot;. Some of them, such as Jonathan Wild, became infamous at the time for staging robberies in order to receive the reward.

In 1737, George II began paying some London and Middlesex watchmen with tax monies, beginning the shift to government control. In 1749, Judge Henry Fielding began organizing a force of quasi-professional constables known as the Bow Street Runners. The Bow Street Runners are considered to have been Britain&#x27;s first dedicated police force. They represented a formalization and regularization of existing policing methods, similar to the unofficial &#x27;thief-takers&#x27;. What made them different was their formal attachment to the Bow Street magistrates&#x27; office, and payment by the magistrate with funds from the central government. They worked out of Fielding&#x27;s office and court at No. 4 Bow Street, and did not patrol but served writs and arrested offenders on the authority of the magistrates, travelling nationwide to apprehend criminals. Fielding wanted to regulate and legalize law enforcement activities due to the high rate of corruption and mistaken or malicious arrests seen with the system that depended mainly on private citizens and state rewards for law enforcement. Henry Fielding&#x27;s work was carried on by his brother, Justice John Fielding, who succeeded him as magistrate in the Bow Street office. Under John Fielding, the institution of the Bow Street Runners gained more and more recognition from the government, although the force was only funded intermittently in the years that followed. In 1763, the Bow Street Horse Patrol was established to combat highway robbery, funded by a government grant. The Bow Street Runners served as the guiding principle for the way that policing developed over the next 80 years. Bow Street was a manifestation of the move towards increasing professionalisation and state control of street life, beginning in London.

The Macdaniel affair, a 1754 British political scandal in which a group of thief-takers was found to be falsely prosecuting innocent men in order to collect reward money from bounties, added further impetus for a publicly salaried police force that did not depend on rewards. Nonetheless, In 1828, there were privately financed police units in no fewer than 45 parishes within a 10-mile radius of London.

The word &quot;police&quot; was borrowed from French into the English language in the 18th century, but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces. The word, and the concept of police itself, were &quot;disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression&quot;. Before the 19th century, the first use of the word &quot;police&quot; recorded in government documents in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the Marine Police in 1798.

===Modern===
====Scotland and Ireland====
Following early police forces established in 1779 and 1788 in Glasgow, Scotland, the Glasgow authorities successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in 1800. Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament. In Ireland, the Irish Constabulary Act 1822 marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle. By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men.

====London====

In 1797, Patrick Colquhoun was able to persuade the West Indies merchants who operated at the Pool of London on the River Thames to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo in imports alone. The idea of a police, as it then existed in France, was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import. In building the case for the police in the face of England&#x27;s firm anti-police sentiment, Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was &quot;perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution&quot;. Moreover, he went so far as to praise the French system, which had reached &quot;the greatest degree of perfection&quot; in his estimation.
With the initial investment of £4,200, the new force the Marine Police began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades, of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and &quot;on the game&quot;. The force was part funded by the London Society of West India Planters and Merchants. The force was a success after its first year, and his men had &quot;established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives&quot;. Word of this success spread quickly, and the government passed the Depredations on the Thames Act 1800 on 28 July 1800, establishing a fully funded police force the Thames River Police together with new laws including police powers; now the oldest police force in the world. Colquhoun published a book on the experiment, &quot;The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames&quot;. It found receptive audiences far outside London, and inspired similar forces in other cities, notably, New York City, Dublin, and Sydney.

Colquhoun&#x27;s utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost-benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives. Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street, the river police were full-time, salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees. His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames.

====Metropolitan====

London was fast reaching a size unprecedented in world history, due to the onset of the Industrial Revolution. It became clear that the locally maintained system of volunteer constables and &quot;watchmen&quot; was ineffective, both in detecting and preventing crime. A parliamentary committee was appointed to investigate the system of policing in London. Upon Sir Robert Peel being appointed as Home Secretary in 1822, he established a second and more effective committee, and acted upon its findings.

Royal assent to the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 was given and the Metropolitan Police Service was established on September 29, 1829, in London. Peel, widely regarded as the father of modern policing, was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of Jeremy Bentham, who called for a strong and centralised, but politically neutral, police force for the maintenance of social order, for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible deterrent to urban crime and disorder. Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession, to organise it in a civilian fashion, and to make it answerable to the public.
Due to public fears concerning the deployment of the military in domestic matters, Peel organised the force along civilian lines, rather than paramilitary. To appear neutral, the uniform was deliberately manufactured in blue, rather than red which was then a military colour, along with the officers being armed only with a wooden truncheon and a rattle to signal the need for assistance. Along with this, police ranks did not include military titles, with the exception of Sergeant.

To distance the new police force from the initial public view of it as a new tool of government repression, Peel publicised the so-called Peelian principles, which set down basic guidelines for ethical policing:
* Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests but on the deterrence of crime.
* Above all else, an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount. Hence, Peel&#x27;s most often quoted principle that &quot;The police are the public and the public are the police.&quot;
The Metropolitan Police Act 1829 created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and its powers and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system. Their job was apolitical; to maintain the peace and apprehend criminals for the courts to process according to the law. This was very different from the &quot;continental model&quot; of the police force that had been developed in France, where the police force worked within the parameters of the absolutist state as an extension of the authority of the monarch and functioned as part of the governing state.

In 1863, the Metropolitan Police were issued with the distinctive custodian helmet, and in 1884 they switched to the use of whistles that could be heard from much further away. The Metropolitan Police became a model for the police forces in many countries, including the United States and most of the British Empire. Bobbies can still be found in many parts of the Commonwealth of Nations.

====Australia====
In Australia, organized law enforcement emerged soon after British colonization began in 1788. The first law enforcement organizations were the Night Watch and Row Boat Guard, which were formed in 1789 to police Sydney. Their ranks were drawn from well-behaved convicts deported to Australia. The Night Watch was replaced by the Sydney Foot Police in 1790. In New South Wales, rural law enforcement officials were appointed by local justices of the peace during the early to mid-19th century and were referred to as &quot;bench police&quot; or &quot;benchers&quot;. A mounted police force was formed in 1825.

The first police force having centralised command as well as jurisdiction over an entire colony was the South Australia Police, formed in 1838 under Henry Inman. However, whilst the New South Wales Police Force was established in 1862, it was made up from a large number of policing and military units operating within the then Colony of New South Wales and traces its links back to the Royal Marines. The passing of the Police Regulation Act of 1862 essentially tightly regulated and centralised all of the police forces operating throughout the Colony of New South Wales.

Each Australian state and territory maintain its own police force, while the Australian Federal Police enforces laws at the federal level. The New South Wales Police Force remains the largest police force in Australia in terms of personnel and physical resources. It is also the only police force that requires its recruits to undertake university studies at the recruit level and has the recruit pay for their own education.

====Brazil====
In 1566, the first police investigator of Rio de Janeiro was recruited. By the 17th century, most captaincies already had local units with law enforcement functions. On July 9, 1775, a Cavalry Regiment was created in the state of Minas Gerais for maintaining law and order. In 1808, the Portuguese royal family relocated to Brazil, because of the French invasion of Portugal. King João VI established the (&#x27;General Police Intendancy&#x27;) for investigations. He also created a Royal Police Guard for Rio de Janeiro in 1809. In 1831, after independence, each province started organizing its local &quot;military police&quot;, with order maintenance tasks. The Federal Railroad Police was created in 1852, Federal Highway Police, was established in 1928, and Federal Police in 1967.

====Canada====
During the early days of English and French colonization, municipalities hired watchmen and constables to provide security. Established in 1729, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (RNC) was the first policing service founded in Canada. The establishment of modern policing services in the Canadas occurred during the 1830s, modelling their services after the London Metropolitan Police, and adopting the ideas of the Peelian principles. The Toronto Police Service was established in 1834 as the first municipal police service in Canada. Prior to that, local able-bodied male citizens had been required to report for night watch duty as special constables for a fixed number of nights a year on penalty of a fine or imprisonment in a system known as &quot;watch and ward.&quot; The Quebec City Police Service was established in 1840.

A national police service, the Dominion Police, was founded in 1868. Initially the Dominion Police provided security for parliament, but its responsibilities quickly grew. In 1870, Rupert&#x27;s Land and the North-Western Territory were incorporated into the country. In an effort to police its newly acquired territory, the Canadian government established the North-West Mounted Police in 1873 (renamed Royal North-West Mounted Police in 1904). In 1920, the Dominion Police, and the Royal Northwest Mounted Police were amalgamated into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

The RCMP provides federal law enforcement; and law enforcement in eight provinces, and all three territories. The provinces of Ontario, and Quebec maintain their own provincial police forces, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), and the Sûreté du Québec (SQ). Policing in Newfoundland and Labrador is provided by the RCMP, and the RNC. The aforementioned services also provide municipal policing, although larger Canadian municipalities may establish their own police service.

====Lebanon====
In Lebanon, the current police force was established in 1861, with creation of the Gendarmerie.

====India====
Under the Mughal Empire, provincial governors called subahdars (or nazims), as well as officials known as faujdars and thanadars were tasked with keeping law and order. Kotwals were responsible for public order in urban areas. In addition, officials called amils, whose primary duties were tax collection, occasionally dealt with rebels. The system evolved under growing British influence that eventually culminated in the establishment of the British Raj. In 1770, the offices of faujdar and amil were abolished. They were brought back in 1774 by Warren Hastings, the first Governor of the Presidency of Fort William (Bengal). In 1791, the first permanent police force was established by Charles Cornwallis, the Commander-in-Chief of British India and Governor of the Presidency of Fort William.

A single police force was established after the formation of the British Raj with the Government of India Act 1858. A uniform police bureaucracy was formed under the Police Act 1861, which established the Superior Police Services. This later evolved into the Indian Imperial Police, which kept order until the Partition of India and independence in 1947. In 1948, the Indian Imperial Police was replaced by the Indian Police Service.

In modern India, the police are under the control of respective States and union territories and are known to be under State Police Services (SPS). The candidates selected for the SPS are usually posted as Deputy Superintendent of Police or Assistant Commissioner of Police once their probationary period ends. On prescribed satisfactory service in the SPS, the officers are nominated to the Indian Police Service. The service color is usually dark blue and red, while the uniform color is &quot;Khaki&quot;.

====United States====
In Colonial America, the county sheriff was the most important law enforcement official. For instance, the New York Sheriff&#x27;s Office was founded in 1626, and the Albany County Sheriff&#x27;s Department in the 1660s. The county sheriff, who was an elected official, was responsible for enforcing laws, collecting taxes, supervising elections, and handling the legal business of the county government. Sheriffs would investigate crimes and make arrests after citizens filed complaints or provided information about a crime but did not carry out patrols or otherwise take preventive action. Villages and cities typically hired constables and marshals, who were empowered to make arrests and serve warrants. Many municipalities also formed a night watch, a group of citizen volunteers who would patrol the streets at night looking for crime and fires. Typically, constables and marshals were the main law enforcement officials available during the day while the night watch would serve during the night. Eventually, municipalities formed day watch groups. Rioting was handled by local militias.

In the 1700s, the Province of Carolina (later North- and South Carolina) established slave patrols in order to prevent slave rebellions and enslaved people from escaping. By 1785 the Charleston Guard and Watch had &quot;a distinct chain of command, uniforms, sole responsibility for policing, salary, authorized use of force, and a focus on preventing crime.&quot;
In 1751 moves towards a municipal police service in Philadelphia were made when the city&#x27;s night watchmen and constables began receiving wages and a Board of Wardens was created to oversee the night watch. 

In 1789 the United States Marshals Service was established, followed by other federal services such as the U.S. Parks Police (1791) and U.S. Mint Police (1792). Municipal police services were created in Richmond, Virginia in 1807, Boston in 1838, and New York City in 1845. The United States Secret Service was founded in 1865 and was for some time the main investigative body for the federal government.
Modern policing influenced by the British model of policing established in 1829 based on the Peelian principles began emerging in the United States in the mid-19th century, replacing previous law enforcement systems based primarily on night watch organizations. Cities began establishing organized, publicly funded, full-time professional police services. In Boston, a day police consisting of six officers under the command of the city marshal was established in 1838 to supplement the city&#x27;s night watch. This paved the way for the establishment of the Boston Police Department in 1854. In New York City, law enforcement up to the 1840s was handled by a night watch as well as 100 city marshals, 51 municipal police officers, and 31 constables. In 1845, the New York City Police Department was established. In Philadelphia, the first police officers to patrol the city in daytime were employed in 1833 as a supplement to the night watch system, leading to the establishment of the Philadelphia Police Department in 1854.

In the American Old West, law enforcement was carried out by local sheriffs, rangers, constables, and federal marshals. There were also town marshals responsible for serving civil and criminal warrants, maintaining the jails, and carrying out arrests for petty crime.

In addition to federal, state, and local forces, some special districts have been formed to provide extra police protection in designated areas. These districts may be known as neighborhood improvement districts, crime prevention districts, or security districts.

In 2022, San Francisco supervisors approved a policy allowing municipal police (San Francisco Police Department) to use robots for various law enforcement and emergency operations, permitting their employment as a deadly force option in cases where the &quot;risk of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option available to SFPD.&quot; This policy has been criticized by groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU, who have argued that &quot;killer robots will not make San Francisco better&quot; and &quot;police might even bring armed robots to a protest.&quot;

==Development of theory==
Michel Foucault wrote that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in public administration and statistics in the 17th and early 18th centuries, most notably with Nicolas Delamare&#x27;s &quot;Traité de la Police&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Police&quot;), first published in 1705. The German &quot;Polizeiwissenschaft&quot; (Science of Police) first theorized by Philipp von Hörnigk, a 17th-century Austrian political economist and civil servant, and much more famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi, who produced an important theoretical work known as Cameral science on the formulation of police. Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of &quot;Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften&quot; (1937) in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4,000 pieces of the practice of &quot;Polizeiwissenschaft&quot;. However, this may be a mistranslation of Foucault&#x27;s own work since the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14,000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520 to 1850.

As conceptualized by the &quot;Polizeiwissenschaft&quot;, according to Foucault the police had an administrative, economic and social duty (&quot;procuring abundance&quot;). It was in charge of demographic concerns and needed to be incorporated within the western political philosophy system of raison d&#x27;état and therefore giving the superficial appearance of empowering the population (and unwittingly supervising the population), which, according to mercantilist theory, was to be the main strength of the state. Thus, its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities and included public health concerns, urban planning (which was important because of the miasma theory of disease; thus, cemeteries were moved out of town, etc.), and surveillance of prices.
The concept of preventive policing, or policing to deter crime from taking place, gained influence in the late 18th century. Police Magistrate John Fielding, head of the Bow Street Runners, argued that &quot;...it is much better to prevent even one man from being a rogue than apprehending and bringing forty to justice.&quot;

The Utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, promoted the views of Italian Marquis Cesare Beccaria, and disseminated a translated version of &quot;Essay on Crime in Punishment&quot;. Bentham espoused the guiding principle of &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number&quot;:

It is better to prevent crimes than to punish them. This is the chief aim of every good system of legislation, which is the art of leading men to the greatest possible happiness or to the least possible misery, according to calculation of all the goods and evils of life.

Patrick Colquhoun&#x27;s influential work, &quot;A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis&quot; (1797) was heavily influenced by Benthamite thought. Colquhoun&#x27;s Thames River Police was founded on these principles, and in contrast to the Bow Street Runners, acted as a deterrent by their continual presence on the riverfront, in addition to being able to intervene if they spotted a crime in progress.

Edwin Chadwick&#x27;s 1829 article, &quot;Preventive police&quot; in the &quot;London Review&quot;, argued that prevention ought to be the &quot;primary&quot; concern of a police body, which was not the case in practice. The reason, argued Chadwick, was that &quot;A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation.&quot; In contrast to a deterrent of punishment, a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective – &quot;crime doesn&#x27;t pay&quot;. In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act, the &quot;object&quot; of the new Metropolitan Police, was changed by Robert Peel to the &quot;principal object,&quot; which was the &quot;prevention of crime.&quot; Later historians would attribute the perception of England&#x27;s &quot;appearance of orderliness and love of public order&quot; to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel&#x27;s police system.

Development of modern police forces around the world was contemporary to the formation of the state, later defined by sociologist Max Weber as achieving a &quot;monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force&quot; and which was primarily exercised by the police and the military. Marxist theory situates the development of the modern state as part of the rise of capitalism, in which the police are one component of the bourgeoisie&#x27;s repressive apparatus for subjugating the working class. By contrast, the Peelian principles argue that &quot;the power of the police ... is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behavior&quot;, a philosophy known as policing by consent.

==Personnel and organization==
Police forces include both preventive (uniformed) police and detectives. Terminology varies from country to country. Police functions include protecting life and property, enforcing criminal law, criminal investigations, regulating traffic, crowd control, public safety duties, civil defense, emergency management, searching for missing persons, lost property and other duties concerned with public order. Regardless of size, police forces are generally organized as a hierarchy with multiple ranks. The exact structures and the names of rank vary considerably by country.

===Uniformed===

The police who wear uniforms make up the majority of a police service&#x27;s personnel. Their main duty is to respond to calls for service. When not responding to these calls, they do work aimed at preventing crime, such as patrols. The uniformed police are known by varying names such as preventive police, the uniform branch/division, administrative police, order police, the patrol bureau/division, or patrol. In Australia and the United Kingdom, patrol personnel are also known as &quot;general duties&quot; officers. Atypically, Brazil&#x27;s preventive police are known as Military Police.

As stated by the name, uniformed police wear uniforms. They perform functions that require an immediate recognition of an officer&#x27;s legal authority and a potential need for force. Most commonly this means intervening to stop a crime in progress and securing the scene of a crime that has already happened. Besides dealing with crime, these officers may also manage and monitor traffic, carry out community policing duties, maintain order at public events or carry out searches for missing people (in 2012, the latter accounted for 14% of police time in the United Kingdom). As most of these duties must be available as a 24/7 service, uniformed police are required to do shift work.

===Detectives===

Police detectives are responsible for investigations and detective work. Detectives may be called Investigations Police, Judiciary/Judicial Police, or Criminal Police. In the United Kingdom, they are often referred to by the name of their department, the Criminal Investigation Department. Detectives typically make up roughly 15–25% of a police service&#x27;s personnel.

Detectives, in contrast to uniformed police, typically wear business-styled attire in bureaucratic and investigative functions, where a uniformed presence would be either a distraction or intimidating but a need to establish police authority still exists. &quot;Plainclothes&quot; officers dress in attire consistent with that worn by the general public for purposes of blending in.

In some cases, police are assigned to work &quot;undercover&quot;, where they conceal their police identity to investigate crimes, such as organized crime or narcotics crime, that are unsolvable by other means. In some cases, this type of policing shares aspects with espionage.

The relationship between detective and uniformed branches varies by country. In the United States, there is high variation within the country itself. Many American police departments require detectives to spend some time on temporary assignments in the patrol division. The argument is that rotating officers helps the detectives to better understand the uniformed officers&#x27; work, to promote cross-training in a wider variety of skills, and prevent &quot;cliques&quot; that can contribute to corruption or other unethical behavior. Conversely, some countries regard detective work as being an entirely separate profession, with detectives working in separate agencies and recruited without having to serve in uniform. A common compromise in English-speaking countries is that most detectives are recruited from the uniformed branch, but once qualified they tend to spend the rest of their careers in the detective branch.

Another point of variation is whether detectives have extra status. In some forces, such as the New York Police Department and Philadelphia Police Department, a regular detective holds a higher rank than a regular police officer. In others, such as British police and Canadian police, a regular detective has equal status with regular uniformed officers. Officers still have to take exams to move to the detective branch, but the move is regarded as being a specialization, rather than a promotion.

===Volunteers and auxiliary===
Police services often include part-time or volunteer officers, some of whom have other jobs outside policing. These may be paid positions or entirely volunteer. These are known by a variety of names, such as reserves, auxiliary police or special constables.

Other volunteer organizations work with the police and perform some of their duties. Groups in the U.S. including the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, Community Emergency Response Team, and the Boy Scouts Police Explorers provide training, traffic and crowd control, disaster response, and other policing duties. In the U.S., the Volunteers in Police Service program assists over 200,000 volunteers in almost 2,000 programs. Volunteers may also work on the support staff. Examples of these schemes are Volunteers in Police Service in the US, Police Support Volunteers in the UK and Volunteers in Policing in New South Wales.

===Specialized===

Specialized preventive and detective groups, or Specialist Investigation Departments, exist within many law enforcement organizations either for dealing with particular types of crime, such as traffic law enforcement, K9/use of police dogs, crash investigation, homicide, or fraud; or for situations requiring specialized skills, such as underwater search, aviation, explosive disposal (&quot;bomb squad&quot;), and computer crime.

Most larger jurisdictions employ police tactical units, specially selected and trained paramilitary units with specialized equipment, weapons, and training, for the purposes of dealing with particularly violent situations beyond the capability of a patrol officer response, including standoffs, counterterrorism, and rescue operations.

In counterinsurgency-type campaigns, select and specially trained units of police armed and equipped as light infantry have been designated as police field forces who perform paramilitary-type patrols and ambushes whilst retaining their police powers in areas that were highly dangerous.

Because their situational mandate typically focuses on removing innocent bystanders from dangerous people and dangerous situations, not violent resolution, they are often equipped with non-lethal tactical tools like chemical agents, stun grenades, and rubber bullets. The Specialist Firearms Command (MO19) of the Metropolitan Police in London is a group of armed police used in dangerous situations including hostage taking, armed robbery/assault and terrorism.

===Administrative duties===
Police may have administrative duties that are not directly related to enforcing the law, such as issuing firearms licenses. The extent that police have these functions varies among countries, with police in France, Germany, and other continental European countries handling such tasks to a greater extent than British counterparts.

===Military===
Military police may refer to:
* a section of the military solely responsible for policing the armed forces, referred to as provosts (e.g., United States Air Force Security Forces)
* a section of the military responsible for policing in both the armed forces and in the civilian population (e.g., most gendarmeries, such as the French Gendarmerie, the Italian Carabinieri, the Spanish Guardia Civil, and the Portuguese National Republican Guard)
* a section of the military solely responsible for policing the civilian population (e.g., Romanian Gendarmerie)
* the civilian preventive police of a Brazilian state (e.g., Policia Militar)
* a special military law enforcement service (e.g., Russian Military Police)

===Religious===

Some jurisdictions with religious laws may have dedicated religious police to enforce said laws. These religious police forces, which may operate either as a unit of a wider police force or as an independent agency, may only have jurisdiction over members of said religion, or they may have the ability to enforce religious customs nationwide regardless of individual religious beliefs.

Religious police may enforce social norms, gender roles, dress codes, and dietary laws per religious doctrine and laws, and may also prohibit practices that run contrary to said doctrine, such as atheism, proselytism, homosexuality, socialization between different genders, business operations during religious periods or events such as salah or the Sabbath, or the sale and possession of &quot;offending material&quot; ranging from pornography to foreign media.

Forms of religious law enforcement were relatively common in historical religious civilizations, but eventually declined in favor of religious tolerance and pluralism. One of the most common forms of religious police in the modern world are Islamic religious police, which enforce the application of Sharia (Islamic religious law). As of 2018, there are eight Islamic countries that maintain Islamic religious police: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Mauritania, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Yemen.

Some forms of religious police may not enforce religious law, but rather suppress religion or religious extremism. This is often done for ideological reasons; for example, communist states such as China and Vietnam have historically suppressed and tightly controlled religions such as Christianity.

===Secret===

Secret police organizations are typically used to suppress dissidents for engaging in non-politically correct communications and activities, which are deemed counter-productive to what the state and related establishment promote. Secret police interventions to stop such activities are often illegal, and are designed to debilitate, in various ways, the people targeted in order to limit or stop outright their ability to act in a non-politically correct manner. The methods employed may involve spying, various acts of deception, intimidation, framing, false imprisonment, false incarceration under mental health legislation, and physical violence. Countries widely reported to use secret police organizations include China (The Ministry of State Security) and North Korea (The Ministry of State Security).

==By country==
Police forces are usually organized and funded by some level of government. The level of government responsible for policing varies from place to place, and may be at the national, regional or local level. Some countries have police forces that serve the same territory, with their jurisdiction depending on the type of crime or other circumstances. Other countries, such as Austria, Chile, Israel, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Africa and Sweden, have a single national police force.

In some places with multiple national police forces, one common arrangement is to have a civilian police force and a paramilitary gendarmerie, such as the Police Nationale and National Gendarmerie in France. The French policing system spread to other countries through the Napoleonic Wars and the French colonial empire. Another example is the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil in Spain. In both France and Spain, the civilian force polices urban areas and the paramilitary force polices rural areas. Italy has a similar arrangement with the Polizia di Stato and Carabinieri, though their jurisdictions overlap more. Some countries have separate agencies for uniformed police and detectives, such as the Military Police and Civil Police in Brazil and the Carabineros and Investigations Police in Chile.

Other countries have sub-national police forces, but for the most part their jurisdictions do not overlap. In many countries, especially federations, there may be two or more tiers of police force, each serving different levels of government and enforcing different subsets of the law. In Australia and Germany, the majority of policing is carried out by state (i.e. provincial) police forces, which are supplemented by a federal police force. Though not a federation, the United Kingdom has a similar arrangement, where policing is primarily the responsibility of a regional police force and specialist units exist at the national level. In Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are the federal police, while municipalities can decide whether to run a local police service or to contract local policing duties to a larger one. Most urban areas have a local police service, while most rural areas contract it to the RCMP, or to the provincial police in Ontario and Quebec.

The United States has a highly decentralized and fragmented system of law enforcement, with over 17,000 state and local law enforcement agencies. These agencies include local police, county law enforcement (often in the form of a sheriff&#x27;s office, or county police), state police and federal law enforcement agencies. Federal agencies, such as the FBI, only have jurisdiction over federal crimes or those that involve more than one state. Other federal agencies have jurisdiction over a specific type of crime. Examples include the Federal Protective Service, which patrols and protects government buildings; the Postal Inspection Service, which protect United States Postal Service facilities, vehicles and items; the Park Police, which protect national parks; and Amtrak Police, which patrol Amtrak stations and trains. There are also some government agencies and uniformed services that perform police functions in addition to other duties, such as the Coast Guard.

==International==

Most countries are members of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), established to detect and fight transnational crime and provide for international co-operation and co-ordination of other police activities, such as notifying relatives of the death of foreign nationals. Interpol does not conduct investigations or arrests by itself, but only serves as a central point for information on crime, suspects and criminals. Political crimes are excluded from its competencies.

The terms international policing, transnational policing, and/or global policing began to be used from the early 1990s onwards to describe forms of policing that transcended the boundaries of the sovereign nation-state. These terms refer in variable ways to practices and forms for policing that, in some sense, transcend national borders. This includes a variety of practices, but international police cooperation, criminal intelligence exchange between police agencies working in different nation-states, and police development-aid to weak, failed or failing states are the three types that have received the most scholarly attention.

Historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross-border police missions for many years. For example, in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals. A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London. The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe, which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before World War II. There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century. It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception. It is also generally agreed that in the post–Cold War era this type of practice became more significant and frequent.

Few empirical works on the practices of inter/transnational information and intelligence sharing have been undertaken. A notable exception is James Sheptycki&#x27;s study of police cooperation in the English Channel region, which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police casework. The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross-Channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned. By 1992, with the signing of the Schengen Treaty, which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union, there were worries that much, if not all, of this intelligence sharing was opaque, raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe.

Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer, so it is difficult to make generalizations, but one small-scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross-border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that the low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature. Intelligence-led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world. James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of &quot;organizational pathologies&quot; have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic. He argues that transnational police information circuits help to &quot;compose the panic scenes of the security-control society&quot;. The paradoxical effect is that, the harder policing agencies work to produce security, the greater are feelings of insecurity.

Police development-aid to weak, failed or failing states is another form of transnational policing that has garnered attention. This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and this looks set to grow in the years ahead, especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in states recovering from conflict. With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions.

One topic concerns making transnational policing institutions democratically accountable. According to the Global Accountability Report for 2007, Interpol had the lowest scores in its category (IGOs), coming in tenth with a score of 22% on overall accountability capabilities.

=== Overseas policing ===

A police force may establish its presence in a foreign country with or without the permission of the host state. In the case of China and the ruling Communist Party, this has involved setting up unofficial police service stations around the world, and using coercive means to influence the behaviour of members of the Chinese diaspora and especially those who hold Chinese citizenship. Political dissidents have been harassed and intimidated in a form of transnational repression and convinced to return to China. Many of these actions were illegal in the states where they occurred. Such police stations have been established in dozens of countries around the world, with some, such as the UK and the US, forcing them to close.

==Equipment==

===Weapons===

In many jurisdictions, police officers carry firearms, primarily handguns, in the normal course of their duties. In the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland), Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and Malta, with the exception of specialist units, officers do not carry firearms as a matter of course. New Zealand and Norwegian police carry firearms in their vehicles, but not on their duty belts, and must obtain authorization before the weapons can be removed from the vehicle unless their life or the life of others are in danger. 

Police often have specialized units for handling armed offenders or dangerous situations where combat is likely, such as police tactical units or authorised firearms officers. In some jurisdictions, depending on the circumstances, police can call on the military for assistance, as military aid to the civil power is an aspect of many armed forces. Perhaps the most high-profile example of this was in 1980, when the British Army&#x27;s Special Air Service was deployed to resolve the Iranian Embassy siege on behalf of the Metropolitan Police.

They can also be armed with &quot;non-lethal&quot; (more accurately known as &quot;less than lethal&quot; or &quot;less-lethal&quot; given that they can still be deadly) weaponry, particularly for riot control, or to inflict pain against a resistant suspect to force them to surrender without lethally wounding them. Non-lethal weapons include batons, tear gas, riot control agents, rubber bullets, riot shields, water cannons, and electroshock weapons. Police officers typically carry handcuffs to restrain suspects.

The use of firearms or deadly force is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save the lives of others or themselves, though some jurisdictions (such as Brazil) allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts. Police officers in the United States are generally allowed to use deadly force if they believe their life is in danger, a policy that has been criticized for being vague. South African police have a &quot;shoot-to-kill&quot; policy, which allows officers to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them. With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime, President Jacob Zuma stated that South Africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries.

===Communications===
Modern police forces make extensive use of two-way radio communications equipment, carried both on the person and installed in vehicles, to coordinate their work, share information, and get help quickly. Vehicle-installed mobile data terminals enhance the ability of police communications, enabling easier dispatching of calls, criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds, and updating officers&#x27; daily activity log and other required reports, on a real-time basis. Other common pieces of police equipment include flashlights, whistles, police notebooks, and &quot;ticket books&quot; or citations. Some police departments have developed advanced computerized data display and communication systems to bring real time data to officers, one example being the NYPD&#x27;s Domain Awareness System.

===Vehicles===
Police vehicles are used for detaining, patrolling, and transporting over wide areas that an officer could not effectively cover otherwise. The average police car used for standard patrol is a four-door sedan, SUV, or CUV, often modified by the manufacturer or police force&#x27;s fleet services to provide better performance. Pickup trucks, off-road vehicles, and vans are often used in utility roles, though in some jurisdictions or situations (such as those where dirt roads are common, off-roading is required, or the nature of the officer&#x27;s assignment necessitates it), they may be used as standard patrol cars. Sports cars are typically not used by police due to cost and maintenance issues, though those that are used are typically only assigned to traffic enforcement or community policing, and are rarely, if ever, assigned to standard patrol or authorized to respond to dangerous calls (such as armed calls or pursuits) where the likelihood of the vehicle being damaged or destroyed is high. Police vehicles are usually marked with appropriate symbols and equipped with sirens and flashing emergency lights to make others aware of police presence or response; in most jurisdictions, police vehicles with their sirens and emergency lights on have right of way in traffic, while in other jurisdictions, emergency lights may be kept on while patrolling to ensure ease of visibility. Unmarked or undercover police vehicles are used primarily for traffic enforcement or apprehending criminals without alerting them to their presence. The use of unmarked police vehicles for traffic enforcement is controversial, with the state of New York banning this practice in 1996 on the grounds that it endangered motorists who might be pulled over by police impersonators.

Motorcycles, having historically been a mainstay in police fleets, are commonly used, particularly in locations that a car may not be able to reach, to control potential public order situations involving meetings of motorcyclists, and often in police escorts where motorcycle police officers can quickly clear a path for escorted vehicles. Bicycle patrols are used in some areas, often downtown areas or parks, because they allow for wider and faster area coverage than officers on foot. Bicycles are also commonly used by riot police to create makeshift barricades against protesters.

Police aviation consists of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, while police watercraft tend to consist of RHIBs, motorboats, and patrol boats. SWAT vehicles are used by police tactical units, and often consist of four-wheeled armored personnel carriers used to transport tactical teams while providing armored cover, equipment storage space, or makeshift battering ram capabilities; these vehicles are typically not armed and do not patrol and are only used to transport. Mobile command posts may also be used by some police forces to establish identifiable command centers at the scene of major situations.

Police cars may contain issued long guns, ammunition for issued weapons, less-lethal weaponry, riot control equipment, traffic cones, road flares, physical barricades or barricade tape, fire extinguishers, first aid kits, or defibrillators.

==Strategies==

The advent of the police car, two-way radio, and telephone in the early 20th century transformed policing into a reactive strategy that focused on responding to calls for service away from their beat. With this transformation, police command and control became more centralized.

In the United States, August Vollmer introduced other reforms, including education requirements for police officers. O.W. Wilson, a student of Vollmer, helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita, Kansas, and later in the Chicago Police Department. Strategies employed by O.W. Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption, establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force, a strict merit system for promotions within the department, and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers. During the professionalism era of policing, law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime and conducting visible car patrols in between, rather than broader focus on crime prevention.

The Kansas City Preventive Patrol study in the early 1970s showed flaws in using visible car patrols for crime prevention. It found that aimless car patrols did little to deter crime and often went unnoticed by the public. Patrol officers in cars had insufficient contact and interaction with the community, leading to a social rift between the two. In the 1980s and 1990s, many law enforcement agencies began to adopt community policing strategies, and others adopted problem-oriented policing.

Broken windows&#x27; policing was another, related approach introduced in the 1980s by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling, who suggested that police should pay greater attention to minor &quot;quality of life&quot; offenses and disorderly conduct. The concept behind this method is simple: broken windows, graffiti, and other physical destruction or degradation of property create an environment in which crime and disorder is more likely. The presence of broken windows and graffiti sends a message that authorities do not care and are not trying to correct problems in these areas. Therefore, correcting these small problems prevents more serious criminal activity. The theory was popularised in the early 1990s by police chief William J. Bratton and New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. It was emulated in 2010s in Kazakhstan through zero tolerance policing. Yet it failed to produce meaningful results in this country because citizens distrusted police while state leaders preferred police loyalty over police good behavior.

Building upon these earlier models, intelligence-led policing has also become an important strategy. Intelligence-led policing and problem-oriented policing are complementary strategies, both of which involve systematic use of information. Although it still lacks a universally accepted definition, the crux of intelligence-led policing is an emphasis on the collection and analysis of information to guide police operations, rather than the reverse.

A related development is evidence-based policing. In a similar vein to evidence-based policy, evidence-based policing is the use of controlled experiments to find which methods of policing are more effective. Leading advocates of evidence-based policing include the criminologist Lawrence W. Sherman and philanthropist Jerry Lee. Findings from controlled experiments include the Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment, evidence that patrols deter crime if they are concentrated in crime hotspots and that restricting police powers to shoot suspects does not cause an increase in crime or violence against police officers. Use of experiments to assess the usefulness of strategies has been endorsed by many police services and institutions, including the U.S. Police Foundation and the UK College of Policing.

==Power restrictions==
In many nations, criminal procedure law has been developed to regulate officers&#x27; discretion, so that they do not arbitrarily or unjustly exercise their powers of arrest, search and seizure, and use of force. In the United States, &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; led to the widespread use of Miranda warnings or constitutional warnings.

In &quot;Miranda&quot; the court created safeguards against self-incriminating statements made after an arrest. The court held that &quot;The prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way, unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s privilege against self-incrimination&quot;

Police in the United States are also prohibited from holding criminal suspects for more than a reasonable amount of time (usually 24–48 hours) before arraignment, using torture, abuse or physical threats to extract confessions, using excessive force to effect an arrest, and searching suspects&#x27; bodies or their homes without a warrant obtained upon a showing of probable cause. The four exceptions to the constitutional requirement of a search warrant are:
* Consent
* Search incident to arrest
* Motor vehicle searches
* Exigent circumstances

In &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot; (1968) the court divided seizure into two parts, the investigatory stop and arrest. The court further held that during an investigatory stop a police officer&#x27;s search &quot; [is] confined to what [is] minimally necessary to determine whether [a suspect] is armed, and the intrusion, which [is] made for the sole purpose of protecting himself and others nearby, [is] confined to ascertaining the presence of weapons&quot; (U.S. Supreme Court). Before Terry, every police encounter constituted an arrest, giving the police officer the full range of search authority. Search authority during a Terry stop (investigatory stop) is limited to weapons only.

Using deception for confessions is permitted, but not coercion. There are exceptions or exigent circumstances such as an articulated need to disarm a suspect or searching a suspect who has already been arrested (Search Incident to an Arrest). The Posse Comitatus Act severely restricts the use of the military for police activity, giving added importance to police SWAT units.

British police officers are governed by similar rules, such as those introduced to England and Wales under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), but generally have greater powers. They may, for example, legally search any suspect who has been arrested, or their vehicles, home or business premises, without a warrant, and may seize anything they find in a search as evidence.

All police officers in the United Kingdom, whatever their actual rank, are &#x27;constables&#x27; in terms of their legal position. This means that a newly appointed constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner. However, certain higher ranks have additional powers to authorize certain aspects of police operations, such as a power to authorize a search of a suspect&#x27;s house (section 18 PACE in England and Wales) by an officer of the rank of Inspector, or the power to authorize a suspect&#x27;s detention beyond 24 hours by a Superintendent.

==Conduct, accountability and public confidence==
Police services commonly include units for investigating crimes committed by the police themselves. These units are typically called internal affairs or inspectorate-general units. In some countries separate organizations outside the police exist for such purposes, such as the British Independent Office for Police Conduct. However, due to American laws around qualified immunity, it has become increasingly difficult to investigate and charge police misconduct and crimes.

Likewise, some state and local jurisdictions, for example, Springfield, Illinois have similar outside review organizations. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is investigated by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, an external agency set up as a result of the Patten report into policing the province. In the Republic of Ireland the Garda Síochána is investigated by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, an independent commission that replaced the Garda Complaints Board in May 2007.

The Special Investigations Unit of Ontario, Canada, is one of only a few civilian agencies around the world responsible for investigating circumstances involving police and others that have resulted in a death, serious injury, or allegations of sexual assault. The agency has made allegations of insufficient cooperation from various police services hindering their investigations.

In Hong Kong, any allegations of corruption within the police are investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Independent Police Complaints Council, two agencies which are independent of the police force.

In the United States, body cameras are often worn by police officers to record their interactions with the public and each other, providing audiovisual recorded evidence for review in the event an officer or agency&#x27;s actions are investigated.

===Use of force===

Police forces also find themselves under criticism for their use of force, particularly deadly force. Specifically, tension increases when a police officer of one ethnic group harms or kills a suspect of another one. In the United States, such events occasionally spark protests and accusations of racism against police and allegations that police departments practice racial profiling. Similar incidents have also happened in other countries.

In the United States since the 1960s, concern over such issues has increasingly weighed upon law enforcement agencies, courts and legislatures at every level of government. Incidents such as the 1965 Watts riots, the videotaped 1991 beating by LAPD officers of Rodney King, and the riot following their acquittal have been suggested by some people to be evidence that U.S. police are dangerously lacking in appropriate controls.

The fact that this trend has occurred contemporaneously with the rise of the civil rights movement, the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;, and a precipitous rise in violent crime from the 1960s to the 1990s has made questions surrounding the role, administration and scope of police authority increasingly complicated.

Police departments and the local governments that oversee them in some jurisdictions have attempted to mitigate some of these issues through community outreach programs and community policing to make the police more accessible to the concerns of local communities, by working to increase hiring diversity, by updating training of police in their responsibilities to the community and under the law, and by increased oversight within the department or by civilian commissions.

In cases in which such measures have been lacking or absent, civil lawsuits have been brought by the United States Department of Justice against local law enforcement agencies, authorized under the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. This has compelled local departments to make organizational changes, enter into consent decree settlements to adopt such measures, and submit to oversight by the Justice Department.

In May 2020, a global movement to increase scrutiny of police violence grew in popularity, starting in Minneapolis, Minnesota with the murder of George Floyd. Calls for defunding of the police and full abolition of the police gained larger support in the United States as more criticized systemic racism in policing.

Critics also argue that sometimes this abuse of force or power can extend to police officer civilian life as well. For example, critics note that women in around 40% of police officer families have experienced domestic violence and that police officers are convicted of misdemeanors and felonies at a rate of more than six times higher than concealed carry weapon permit holders.

===Protection of individuals===
The Supreme Court of the United States has consistently ruled that law enforcement officers in the U.S. have no duty to protect any individual, only to enforce the law in general. This is despite the motto of many police departments in the U.S. being a variation of &quot;protect and serve&quot;; regardless, many departments generally expect their officers to protect individuals. The first case to make such a ruling was &quot;South v. State of Maryland&quot; in 1855, and the most recent was &quot;Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales&quot; in 2005.

In contrast, the police are entitled to protect private rights in some jurisdictions. To ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular competencies of the courts of law, some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts cannot be obtained in time, and where, without interference of the police, the realization of the private right would be impeded. This would, for example, allow police to establish a restaurant guest&#x27;s identity and forward it to the innkeeper in a case where the guest cannot pay the bill at nighttime because his wallet had just been stolen from the restaurant table.

In addition, there are federal law enforcement agencies in the United States whose mission includes providing protection for executives such as the president and accompanying family members, visiting foreign dignitaries, and other high-ranking individuals. Such agencies include the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police.

<text>Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)&#x27;s PDP-10, later marketed as the DECsystem-10, is a mainframe computer family manufactured beginning in 1966 and discontinued in 1983. 1970s models and beyond were marketed under the DECsystem-10 name, especially as the TOPS-10 operating system became widely used.

The PDP-10&#x27;s architecture is almost identical to that of DEC&#x27;s earlier PDP-6, sharing the same 36-bit word length and slightly extending the instruction set. The main difference was a greatly improved hardware implementation. Some aspects of the instruction set are unusual, most notably the &quot;byte&quot; instructions, which operate on bit fields of any size from 1 to 36 bits inclusive, according to the general definition of a byte as &quot;a contiguous sequence of a fixed number of bits&quot;.

The PDP-10 was found in many university computing facilities and research labs during the 1970s, the most notable being Harvard University&#x27;s Aiken Computation Laboratory, MIT&#x27;s AI Lab and Project MAC, Stanford&#x27;s SAIL, Computer Center Corporation (CCC), ETH (ZIR), and Carnegie Mellon University. Its main operating systems, TOPS-10 and TENEX, were used to build out the early ARPANET. For these reasons, the PDP-10 looms large in early hacker folklore.

Projects to extend the PDP-10 line were eclipsed by the success of the unrelated VAX superminicomputer, and the cancellation of the PDP-10 line was announced in 1983. According to reports, DEC sold &quot;about 1500 DECsystem-10s by the end of 1980.&quot;

==Models and technical evolution==


The original PDP-10 processor is the KA10, introduced in 1968. It uses discrete transistors packaged in DEC&#x27;s Flip-Chip technology, with backplanes wire wrapped via a semi-automated manufacturing process. Its cycle time is 1 μs and its add time 2.1 μs. In 1973, the KA10 was replaced by the KI10, which uses transistor–transistor logic (TTL) SSI. This was joined in 1975 by the higher-performance KL10 (later faster variants), which is built from emitter-coupled logic (ECL), microprogrammed, and has cache memory. The KL10&#x27;s performance was about 1 megaflops using 36-bit floating point numbers on matrix row reduction. It was slightly faster than the newer VAX-11/750, although more limited in memory.

A smaller, less expensive model, the KS10, was introduced in 1978, using TTL and Am2901 bit-slice components and including the PDP-11 Unibus to connect peripherals. The KS10 was marketed as the DECSYSTEM-2020, part of the DECSYSTEM-20 range; it was DEC&#x27;s entry in the distributed processing arena, and it was introduced as &quot;the world&#x27;s lowest cost mainframe computer system.&quot;

===KA10===
The KA10 has a maximum main memory capacity (both virtual and physical) of 256 kilowords (equivalent to 1152 kilobytes); the minimum main memory required is 16 kilowords. As supplied by DEC, it did not include paging hardware; memory management consists of two sets of protection and relocation registers, called &quot;base and bounds&quot; registers. This allows each half of a user&#x27;s address space to be limited to a set section of main memory, designated by the base physical address and size. This allows the model of separate read-only shareable code segment (normally the high segment) and read-write data/stack segment (normally the low segment) used by TOPS-10 and later adopted by Unix. Some KA10 machines, first at MIT, and later at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), were modified to add virtual memory and support for demand paging, and more physical memory.

The KA10 weighs about .

The 10/50 was the top-of-the-line Uni-processor KA machine at the time when the &quot;PA1050&quot; software package was introduced. Two other KA10 models were the uniprocessor 10/40, and the dual-processor 10/55.

===KI10===
The KI10 introduced support for paged memory management, and also support a larger physical address space of 4 megawords. KI10 models include 1060, 1070 and 1077, the latter incorporating two CPUs.

===KL10===

The original KL10 PDP-10 (also marketed as DECsystem-10) models (1080, 1088, etc.) use the original PDP-10 memory bus, with external memory modules. Module in this context meant a cabinet, dimensions roughly (WxHxD) 30 x 75 x 30 in. with a capacity of 32 to 256 kWords of magnetic-core memory. The processors used in the DECSYSTEM-20 (2040, 2050, 2060, 2065), commonly but incorrectly called &quot;KL20&quot;, use internal memory, mounted in the same cabinet as the CPU. The 10xx models also have different packaging; they come in the original tall PDP-10 cabinets, rather than the short ones used later on for the DECSYSTEM-20. The differences between the 10xx and 20xx models were primarily which operating system they ran, either TOPS-10 or TOPS-20. Apart from that, differences are more cosmetic than real; some 10xx systems have &quot;20-style&quot; internal memory and I/O, and some 20xx systems have &quot;10-style&quot; external memory and an I/O bus. In particular, all ARPAnet TOPS-20 systems had an I/O bus because the AN20 IMP interface was an I/O bus device. Both could run either TOPS-10 or TOPS-20 microcode and thus the corresponding operating system.

====Model B====
The later Model B version of the 2060 processors removes the 256 kiloword limit on the virtual address space by supporting up to 32 &quot;sections&quot; of up to 256 kilowords each, along with substantial changes to the instruction set. The two versions are effectively different CPUs. The first operating system that takes advantage of the Model B&#x27;s capabilities is TOPS-20 release 3, and user mode extended addressing is offered in TOPS-20 release 4. TOPS-20 versions after release 4.1 only run on a Model B.

TOPS-10 versions 7.02 and 7.03 also use extended addressing when run on a 1090 (or 1091) Model B processor running TOPS-20 microcode.

====MCA25====
The final upgrade to the KL10 was the MCA25 upgrade of a 2060 to 2065 (or a 1091 to 1095), which gave some performance increases for programs which run in multiple sections.

====Massbus====
The I/O architecture of the 20xx series KL machines is based on a DEC bus design called the Massbus. While many attributed the success of the PDP-11 to DEC&#x27;s decision to make the PDP-11 Unibus an open architecture, DEC reverted to prior philosophy with the KL, making Massbus both unique and proprietary. Consequently, there were no aftermarket peripheral manufacturers who made devices for the Massbus, and DEC chose to price their own Massbus devices, notably the RP06 disk drive, at a substantial premium above comparable IBM-compatible devices. CompuServe for one, designed its own alternative disk controller that could operate on the Massbus, but connect to IBM style 3330 disk subsystems.

====Front-end processors====

The KL class machines have a PDP-11/40 front-end processor for system start-up and monitoring. The PDP-11 is booted from a dual-ported RP06 disk drive (or alternatively from an 8&quot; floppy disk drive or DECtape), and then commands can be given to the PDP-11 to start the main processor, which is typically booted from the same RP06 disk drive as the PDP-11. The PDP-11 performs watchdog functions once the main processor is running.

Communication with IBM mainframes, including Remote Job Entry (RJE), was accomplished via a DN61 or DN-64 front-end processor, using a PDP-11/40 or PDP-11/34a.

===KS10===

The KS10 is a lower-cost PDP-10 built using AMD 2901 bit-slice chips, with an Intel 8080A microprocessor as a control processor. The KS10 design was crippled to be a Model A even though most of the necessary data paths needed to support the Model B architecture are present. This was no doubt intended to segment the market, but it greatly shortened the KS10&#x27;s product life.

The KS system uses a similar boot procedure to the KL10. The 8080 control processor loads the microcode from an RM03, RM80, or RP06 disk or magnetic tape and then starts the main processor. The 8080 switches modes after the operating system boots and controls the console and remote diagnostic serial ports.

===Magnetic tape drives===
Two models of tape drives were supported by the TM10 Magnetic Tape Control subsystem:
* TU20 Magnetic Tape Transport – 45 ips (inches/second)
* TU30 Magnetic Tape Transport – 75 ips (inches/second)
* TU45 Magnetic Tape Transport – 75 ips (inches/second)
A mix of up to eight of these could be supported, using seven-track or nine-track devices. The TU20 and TU30 each came in A (9-track) and B (7-track) versions, and all of the aforementioned tape drives could read/write from/to 200 BPI, 556 BPI and 800 BPI IBM-compatible tapes.

The TM10 Magtape controller was available in two submodels:
* TM10A did cycle-stealing to/from PDP-10 memory using the KA10 Arithmetic Processor
* TM10B accessed PDP-10 memory using a DF10 Data Channel, without &quot;cycle stealing&quot; from the KA10 Arithmetic Processor

==Instruction set architecture==
From the first PDP-6s to the KL-10 and KS-10, the user-mode instruction set architecture is largely the same. This section covers that architecture. The only major change to the architecture is the addition of multi-section extended addressing in the KL-10; extended addressing, which changes the process of generating the effective address of an instruction, is briefly discussed at the end. Generally, the system has 36-bit words and instructions, and 18-bit addresses.

=== Registers ===
There are 16 general-purpose, 36-bit registers. The right half of these registers (other than register 0) may be used for indexing. A few instructions operate on pairs of registers. The &quot;PC Word&quot; register is split in half; the right 18 bits contains the program counter and the left 13 bits contains the processor status flags, with five zeros between the two sections. The condition register bits, which record the results of arithmetic operations (&quot;e.g.&quot; overflow), can be accessed by only a few instructions.

In the original KA-10 systems, these registers are simply the first 16 words of main memory. The &quot;fast registers&quot; hardware option implements them as registers in the CPU, still addressable as the first 16 words of memory. Some software takes advantage of this by using the registers as an instruction cache by loading code into the registers and then jumping to the appropriate address; this is used, for example, in Maclisp to implement one version of the garbage collector. Later models all have registers in the CPU.

=== Supervisor mode ===
There are two operational modes, supervisor and user mode. Besides the difference in memory referencing described above, supervisor-mode programs can execute input/output operations.

Communication from user-mode to supervisor-mode is done through Unimplemented User Operations (UUOs): instructions which are not defined by the hardware, and are trapped by the supervisor. This mechanism is also used to emulate operations which may not have hardware implementations in cheaper models.

=== Data types ===
The major datatypes which are directly supported by the architecture are two&#x27;s complement 36-bit integer arithmetic (including bitwise operations), 36-bit floating-point, and halfwords. Extended, 72-bit, floating point is supported through special instructions designed to be used in multi-instruction sequences. Byte pointers are supported by special instructions. A word structured as a &quot;count&quot; half and a &quot;pointer&quot; half facilitates the use of bounded regions of memory, notably stacks.

=== Instructions ===

Instructions are stored in 36-bit words. There are two formats, general instructions and input/output instructions.

In general instructions, the leftmost 9 bits, 0 to 8, contain an instruction opcode. Many of the possible 512 codes are not defined in the base model machines and are reserved for expansion like the addition of a hardware floating point unit. Following the opcode in bits 9 to 12 is the number of a register which will be used for the instruction. The input/output instructions all start with bits 0 through 2 being set to 1 (decimal value 7), bits 3 through 9 containing a device number, and 10 through 12 the instruction opcode.

In both formats, bits 13 through 35 are used to form the &quot;effective address&quot;, E. Bits 18 through 35 contain a numerical constant address, Y. This address may be modified by adding the 18-bit value in a register, X, the register number indicated in bits 14 to 17. If these are set to zero, no indexing is used, meaning register 0 cannot be used for indexing. Bit 13, I, indicates indirection, meaning the ultimate effective address used by the instruction is not E, but the address stored in memory location E. When using indirection, the data in word E is interpreted in the same way as the layout of the instruction; bits 0 to 12 are ignored, and 13 through 35 form I, X and Y as above.

Instruction execution begins by calculating E. It adds the contents of the given register X (if not 0) to the offset Y; then, if the indirect bit is 1, the value at E is fetched and the effective address calculation is repeated. If I is 1 in the stored value at E in memory, the system will then indirect through that address as well, possibly following many such steps. This process continues until an indirect word with a zero indirect bit is reached. Indirection of this sort was a common feature of processor designs of this era.

In supervisor mode, addresses correspond directly to physical memory. In user mode, addresses are translated to physical memory. Earlier models give a user process a &quot;high&quot; and a &quot;low&quot; memory: addresses with a 0 top bit use one base register and those with a 1 use another. Each segment is contiguous. Later architectures have paged memory access, allowing non-contiguous address spaces. The CPU&#x27;s general-purpose registers can also be addressed as memory locations 0–15.

====General instructions====
There are three main classes of general instructions: arithmetic, logical, and move; conditional jump; conditional skip (which may have side effects). There are also several smaller classes.

The arithmetic, logical, and move operations include variants which operate immediate-to-register, memory-to-register, register-to-memory, register-and-memory-to-both or memory-to-memory. Since registers may be addressed as part of memory, register-to-register operations are also defined. (Not all variants are useful, though they are well-defined.) For example, the ADD operation has as variants ADDI (add an 18-bit &quot;I&quot;mmediate constant to a register), ADDM (add register contents to a &quot;M&quot;emory location), ADDB (add to &quot;B&quot;oth, that is, add register contents to memory and also put the result in the register). A more elaborate example is HLROM (&quot;H&quot;alf &quot;L&quot;eft to &quot;R&quot;ight, &quot;O&quot;nes to &quot;M&quot;emory), which takes the Left half of the register contents, places them in the Right half of the memory location, and replaces the left half of the memory location with Ones. Halfword instructions are also used for linked lists: HLRZ is the Lisp CAR operator; HRRZ is CDR.

The conditional jump operations examine register contents and jump to a given location depending on the result of the comparison. The mnemonics for these instructions all start with JUMP, JUMPA meaning &quot;jump always&quot; and JUMP meaning &quot;jump never&quot; – as a consequence of the symmetric design of the instruction set, it contains several no-ops such as JUMP. For example, JUMPN A,LOC jumps to the address LOC if the contents of register A is non-zero. There are also conditional jumps based on the processor&#x27;s condition register using the JRST instruction. On the KA10 and KI10, JRST is faster than JUMPA, so the standard unconditional jump is JRST.

The conditional skip operations compare register and memory contents and skip the next instruction (which is often an unconditional jump) depending on the result of the comparison. A simple example is CAMN A,LOC which compares the contents of register A with the contents of location LOC and skips the next instruction if they are not equal. A more elaborate example is TLCE A,LOC (read &quot;Test Left Complement, skip if Equal&quot;), which using the contents of LOC as a mask, selects the corresponding bits in the left half of register A. If all those bits are &quot;E&quot;qual to zero, skip the next instruction; and in any case, replace those bits by their Boolean complement.

Some smaller instruction classes include the shift/rotate instructions and the procedure call instructions. Particularly notable are the stack instructions PUSH and POP, and the corresponding stack call instructions PUSHJ and POPJ. The byte instructions use a special format of indirect word to extract and store arbitrary-sized bit fields, possibly advancing a pointer to the next unit.

====Input/output instructions====
The PDP-10 does not use memory-mapped devices, in contrast to the PDP-11 and later DEC machines. A separate set of instructions is used to move data to and from devices defined by a device number in the instruction. Bits 3 to 9 contain the device number, with the 7 bits allowing a total of 128 devices. Instructions allow for the movement of data to and from devices in word-at-a-time (DATAO and DATAI) or block-at-a-time (BLKO, BLKI).

In block mode, the value pointed to by E is a word in memory that is split in two, the right 18 bits indicate a starting address in memory where the data is located (or written into) and the left 18 bits are a counter. The block instructions increment both values every time they are called, thereby increasing the counter as well as moving to the next location in memory. It then performs a DATAO or DATAI. Finally, it checks the counter side of the value at E, if it is non-zero, it skips the next instruction. If it is zero, it performs the next instruction, normally a JUMP back to the top of the loop. The BLK instructions are effectively small programs that loop over a DATA and increment instructions, but by having this implemented in the processor itself, it avoids the need to repeatedly read the series of instructions from main memory and thus performs the loop much more rapidly.

The final set of I/O instructions are used to write and read condition codes on the device, CONO and CONI. Additionally, CONSZ will perform a CONI, bitmask the retrieved data against the value in E, and then skip the next instruction if it is zero, used in a fashion similar to the BLK commands. Only the right 18 bits are tested in CONSZ.

===Interrupt handling===
A second use of the CONO instruction is to set the device&#x27;s priority level for interrupt handling. There are three bits in the CONO instruction, 33 through 35, allowing the device to be set to level 0 through 7. Level 1 is the highest, meaning that if two devices raise an interrupt at the same time, the lowest-numbered device will begin processing. Level 0 means &quot;no interrupts&quot;, so a device set to level 0 will not stop the processor even if it does raise an interrupt.

Each device channel has two memory locations associated with it, one at 40+2N and the other at 41+2N, where N is the channel number. Thus, channel 1 uses locations 42 and 43. When the interrupt is received and accepted, meaning no higher-priority interrupt is already running, the system stops at the next memory read part of the instruction cycle and instead begins processing at the address stored in the first of those two locations. It is up to the interrupt handler to turn off the interrupt level when it is complete, which it can do by running a CONO, DATA or BLK instruction. As a special case, if the instruction is BLKI or BLKO, and the incremented count is not zero, the interrupt is dismissed immediately, otherwise the second instruction is executed to process the interrupt. This provided a low-cost medium performance version of direct memory access.

Two of the device numbers are set aside for special purposes. Device 0 is the computer&#x27;s front-panel console; reading that device retrieves the settings of the panel switches while writing lights up the status lamps. Device 4 is the &quot;priority interrupt&quot;, which can be read using CONI to gain additional information about an interrupt that has occurred.

===Extended addressing===
In processors supporting extended addressing, the address space is divided into &quot;sections&quot;. An 18-bit address is a &quot;local address&quot;, containing an offset within a section, and a &quot;global address&quot; is 30 bits, divided into a 12-bit section number at the bottom of the left 18 bits and an 18-bit offset within that section in the right 18 bits. A register can contain either a &quot;local index&quot;, with an 18-bit unsigned displacement or local address in the right 18 bits, or a &quot;global index&quot;, with a 30-bit unsigned displacement or global address in the right 30 bits. An indirect word can either be a &quot;local indirect word&quot;, with its uppermost bit set, the next 12 bits reserved, and the remaining bits being an indirect bit, a 4-bit register code, and an 18-bit displacement, or a &quot;global indirect word&quot;, with its uppermost bit clear, the next bit being an indirect bit, the next 4 bits being a register code, and the remaining 30 bits being a displacement.

The process of calculating the effective address generates a 12-bit section number and an 18-bit offset within that segment.

==Software==

===Operating systems===
The original PDP-10 operating system was simply called &quot;Monitor&quot;, but was later renamed TOPS-10. Eventually the PDP-10 system itself was renamed the DECsystem-10. Early versions of Monitor and TOPS-10 formed the basis of Stanford&#x27;s WAITS operating system and the CompuServe time-sharing system.

Over time, some PDP-10 operators began running operating systems assembled from major components developed outside DEC. For example, the main Scheduler might come from one university, the Disk Service from another, and so on. The commercial timesharing services such as CompuServe, On-Line Systems, Inc. (OLS), and Rapidata maintained sophisticated inhouse systems programming groups so that they could modify the operating system as needed for their own businesses without being dependent on DEC or others. There are also strong user communities such as DECUS through which users can share software that they have developed.

BBN developed their own alternative operating system, TENEX, which fairly quickly became popular in the research community. DEC later ported TENEX to the KL10, enhanced it considerably, and named it TOPS-20, forming the DECSYSTEM-20 line.

MIT, which had developed CTSS, Compatible Time-Sharing System to run on their IBM 709 (and later a modified IBM 7094 system), also developed ITS, Incompatible Timesharing System to run on their PDP-6 (and later a modified PDP-10);

Tymshare developed TYMCOM-X, derived from TOPS-10 but using a page-based file system like TOPS-20.

===Programming languages===
DEC maintained DECsystem-10 FORTRAN IV (F40) for the PDP-10 from 1967 to 1975

MACRO-10 (assembly language macro compiler), COBOL, BASIC and AID were supported under the multi processing and swapping monitors.

In practice a number of other programming environments were available including LISP and SNOBOL at the Hatfield Polytechnic site around 1970.

== Clones ==
In 1971 to 1972, researchers at Xerox PARC were frustrated by top company management&#x27;s refusal to let them buy a PDP-10. Xerox had just bought Scientific Data Systems (SDS) in 1969, and wanted PARC to use an SDS machine. Instead, a group led by Charles P. Thacker designed and constructed two PDP-10 clone systems named MAXC (pronounced as Max, in honour of Max Palevsky, who had sold SDS to Xerox) for their own use. MAXC was also a backronym for Multiple Access Xerox Computer. MAXC ran a modified version of TENEX.

Third-party attempts to sell PDP-10 clones were relatively unsuccessful; see Foonly, Systems Concepts, and XKL.

== Use by CompuServe ==
One of the largest collections of DECsystem-10 architecture systems ever assembled was at CompuServe, which, at its peak, operated over 200 loosely coupled systems in three data centers in Columbus, Ohio. CompuServe used these systems as &#x27;hosts&#x27;, providing access to commercial applications, and the CompuServe Information Service. While the first such systems were bought from DEC, when DEC abandoned the PDP-10 architecture in favor of the VAX, CompuServe and other PDP-10 customers began buying plug compatible computers from Systems Concepts. , CompuServe was operating a small number of PDP-10 architecture machines to perform some billing and routing functions.

The main power supplies used in the KL-series machines were so inefficient that CompuServe engineers designed a replacement supply that used about half the energy. CompuServe offered to license the design for its KL supply to DEC for free if DEC would promise that any new KL bought by CompuServe would have the more efficient supply installed. DEC declined the offer.
Another modification made to the PDP-10 by CompuServe engineers was replacing the hundreds of incandescent indicator lamps on the KI10 processor cabinet with LED lamp modules. The cost of conversion was easily offset by cost savings in electricity use, reduced heat, and labor needed to replace burned-out lamps. Digital followed this step all over the world. The picture on the right hand side shows the light panel of the MF10 memory which is contemporary with the KI10 CPU. This item is part of a computer museum, and was populated with LEDs in 2008 for demonstration purposes only. There were no similar banks of indicator lamps on KL and KS processors themselves - only on legacy memory and peripheral devices.

==Cancellation and influence==
The PDP-10 was eventually eclipsed by the VAX superminicomputer machines (descendants of the PDP-11) when DEC recognized that the PDP-10 and VAX product lines were competing with each other and decided to concentrate its software development effort on the more profitable VAX. The PDP-10 product line cancellation was announced in 1983, including cancelling the ongoing Jupiter project to produce a new high-end PDP-10 processor (despite that project being in good shape at the time of the cancellation) and the Minnow project to produce a desktop PDP-10, which may then have been at the prototyping stage.

This event spelled the doom of ITS and the technical cultures that had spawned the original jargon file, but by the 1990s it had become something of a badge of honor among old-time hackers to have cut one&#x27;s teeth on a PDP-10.

The PDP-10 assembly language instructions LDB and DPB (load/deposit byte) live on as functions in the programming language Common Lisp. See the &quot;References&quot; section on the LISP article. The 36-bit word size of the PDP-6 and PDP-10 was influenced by the programming convenience of having 2 LISP pointers, each 18 bits, in one word.

Will Crowther created &quot;Adventure&quot;, the prototypical computer adventure game, for a PDP-10. Don Daglow created the first computer baseball game (1971) and &quot;Dungeon&quot; (1975), the first role-playing video game on a PDP-10. Walter Bright originally created &quot;Empire&quot; for the PDP-10. Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle created the first MUD on a PDP-10. &quot;Zork&quot; was written on the PDP-10. Infocom used PDP-10s for game development and testing.

Bill Gates and Paul Allen originally wrote Altair BASIC using an Intel 8080 simulator running on a PDP-10 at Harvard University. Allen repurposed the PDP-10 assembler as a cross assembler for the 8080 chip. They founded Microsoft shortly after.

== Emulation or simulation ==
The software for simulation of historical computers, SIMH, contains modules to emulate all the PDP-10 CPU models on a Windows or Unix-based machine. Copies of DEC&#x27;s original distribution tapes are available as downloads from the Internet so that a running TOPS-10 or TOPS-20 system may be established. ITS and WAITS are also available for SIMH. A PDP-10 front panel replica for the KA10 processor is available for the SIMH emulation running on a Raspberry Pi.

Ken Harrenstien&#x27;s KLH10 software for Unix-like systems emulates a KL10B processor with extended addressing and 4 MW of memory or a KS10 processor with 512 KW of memory. The KL10 emulation supports v.442 of the KL10 microcode, which enables it to run the final versions of both TOPS-10 and TOPS-20. The KS10 emulation supports both ITS v.262 microcode for the final version of KS10 ITS and DEC v.130 microcode for the final versions of KS TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.

<text>The DECSYSTEM-20 was a family of 36-bit Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 mainframe computers running the TOPS-20 operating system and was introduced in 1977.

PDP-10 computers running the TOPS-10 operating system were labeled &quot;DECsystem-10&quot; as a way of differentiating them from the PDP-11. Later on, those systems running TOPS-20 (on the KL10 PDP-10 processors) were labeled &quot;DECSYSTEM-20&quot; (the block capitals being the result of a lawsuit brought against DEC by Singer, which made its own System Ten model, occasionally referenced in reporting as the &quot;System 10&quot;). The DECSYSTEM-20 was sometimes called PDP-20, although this designation was never used by DEC.

==Models==
The following models were produced:

*DECSYSTEM-2020: KS10 bit-slice processor with up to 512 kilowords of solid state RAM (The ADP OnSite version of the DECSYSTEM-2020 supported 1 MW of RAM)
*DECSYSTEM-2040: KL10 ECL processor with up to 1024 kilowords of magnetic core RAM
*DECSYSTEM-2050: KL10 ECL processor with 2k words of cache and up to 1024 kilowords of RAM
*DECSYSTEM-2060: KL10 ECL processor with 2k words of cache and up to 4096 kilowords of solid state memory
*DECSYSTEM-2065: DECSYSTEM-2060 with MCA25 pager (double-sized (1024 entry) two-way associative hardware page table)

The only significant difference the user could see between a DECsystem-10 and a DECSYSTEM-20 was the operating system and the color of the paint. Most (but not all) machines sold to run TOPS-10 were painted &quot;Blasi Blue&quot;, whereas most TOPS-20 machines were painted &quot;Terracotta&quot; (often mistakenly called &quot;Chinese Red&quot; or orange; the actual name of the color on the paint cans was Terra Cotta).

There were some significant internal differences between the earlier KL10 Model A processors, used in the earlier DECsystem-10s running on KL10 processors, and the later KL10 Model Bs, used for the DECSYSTEM-20s. Model As used the original PDP-10 memory bus, with external memory modules. The later Model B processors used in the DECSYSTEM-20 used internal memory, mounted in the same cabinet as the CPU. The Model As also had different packaging; they came in the original tall PDP-10 cabinets, rather than the short ones used later on for the DECSYSTEM-20.

The last released implementation of DEC&#x27;s 36-bit architecture was the single cabinet DECSYSTEM-2020, using a KS10 processor.
The DECSYSTEM-20 was primarily designed and used as a small mainframe for timesharing. That is, multiple users would concurrently log on to individual user accounts and share use of the main processor to compile and run applications. Separate disk allocations were maintained for all users by the operating system, and various levels of protection could be maintained by for System, Owner, Group, and World users. A model 2060, for example, could typically host up to 40 to 60 simultaneous users before exhibiting noticeably delayed response time.

==Remaining machines==
The Living Computer Museum of Seattle, Washington, maintained a 2065 running TOPS-10, which was available to interested parties via SSH upon registration (at no cost) at their website.

==Trivia==
The first ever email spam message on 1 May 1978 was an advertisement for west coast users of the ARPANET to come see a DECSYSTEM-20.

<text>Programmed Data Processor (PDP), referred to by some customers, media and authors as &quot;Programmable Data Processor,&quot; is a term used by the Digital Equipment Corporation from 1957 to 1990 for several lines of minicomputers.

The name &quot;PDP&quot; intentionally avoids the use of the term &quot;computer&quot;. At the time of the first PDPs, computers had a reputation of being large, complicated, and expensive machines. The venture capitalists behind Digital (especially Georges Doriot) would not support Digital&#x27;s attempting to build a &quot;computer&quot; and the term &quot;minicomputer&quot; had not yet been coined. So instead, Digital used their existing line of logic modules to build a &quot;Programmed Data Processor&quot; and aimed it at a market that could not afford the larger computers.

The various PDP machines can generally be grouped into families based on word length.

==Series==
Members of the PDP series include:

;PDP-1: The original PDP, an 18-bit four-rack machine used in early time-sharing operating system work, and prominent in MIT&#x27;s early hacker culture, which led to the (Massachusetts) Route 128 hardware startup belt (DEC&#x27;s second home, Prime Computer, etc.). What is believed to be the first video game, &quot;Spacewar!&quot;, was developed for this machine, along with the first known word processing program for a general-purpose computer, &quot;Expensive Typewriter&quot;. It was based to some extent on the TX-0 which Ben Gurley had also contributed to. His engineering requirement was to build it from inventory (DEC&#x27;s existing product, System Modules).

:The last of DEC&#x27;s 53 PDP-1 computers was built in 1969, a decade after the first, and nearly all of them were still in use as of 1975. &quot;An average configuration cost $120,000&quot; at a time &quot;when most computer systems sold for a million dollars or more.&quot;

:Its architectural successors as 18-bit machines were the PDP-4, PDP-7, PDP-9, and the PDP-15.

;PDP-2: A number reserved for an unbuilt, undesigned 24-bit design.
;PDP-3: First DEC-designed (for US &quot;black budget&quot; outfits) 36-bit machine, though DEC did not offer it as a product. The only PDP-3 was built from DEC modules by the CIA&#x27;s Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI) in Waltham, Massachusetts to process radar cross section data for the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft in 1960. Architecturally it was essentially a PDP-1 controlling a PDP-1 stretched to 36-bit word width.
;PDP-4: This 18-bit machine, first shipped in 1962 of which &quot;approximately 54 were sold&quot; was a compromise: &quot;with slower memory and different packaging&quot; than the PDP-1, but priced at $65,000 - considerably less than its predecessor (about half the price). All later 18-bit PDP machines (7, 9 and 15) are based on a similar, but enlarged instruction set, more powerful, but based on the same concepts as the 12-bit PDP-5/PDP-8 series. One customer of these early PDP machines was Atomic Energy of Canada. The installation at Chalk River, Ontario included an early PDP-4 with a display system and a new PDP-5 as interface to the research reactor instrumentation and control.
;PDP-5: It was the world&#x27;s first commercially produced minicomputer and DEC&#x27;s first 12-bit machine (1963). The instruction set was later expanded in the PDP-8 to handle more bit rotations and to increase the maximum memory size from 4K words to 32K words. It was one of the first computer series with more than 1,000 built.
;PDP-6: This 36-bit machine, DEC&#x27;s first large PDP computer, came in 1964 with the first DEC-supported timesharing system. 23 were installed. Although the PDP-6 was &quot;disappointing to management,&quot; it introduced the instruction set and was the prototype for the far more successful PDP-10 and DEC System-20, of which hundreds were sold.
;PDP-7: Replacement for the PDP-4; DEC&#x27;s first wire-wrapped machine using the associated Flip-Chip module form-factor. It was introduced in 1964, and a second version, the 7A, was subsequently added. A total of 120 PDP-7 and PDP-7A systems were sold.

:The first version of Unix, and the first version of B, a predecessor of C, were written for the PDP-7 at Bell Labs, as was the first version (by DEC) of MUMPS.
;PDP-8: 12-bit machine (1965) with a tiny instruction set; DEC&#x27;s first major commercial success and the start of the minicomputer revolution. Many were purchased (at discount prices, a DEC tradition, which also included free manuals for anyone who asked during the Ken Olsen years) by schools, university departments, and research laboratories.

:Over 50,000 units among various models of the family (A, E, F, I, S, L, M) were sold. Later models are also used in the DECmate word processor and the VT-78 workstation. 
;LINC-8: The system contained both a PDP-8 CPU and a LINC CPU; two instruction sets; 1966. Progenitor of the PDP-12.
;PDP-9: Successor to the PDP-7; DEC&#x27;s first micro-programmed machine (1966). It features a speed increase of approximately twice that of the PDP-7. The PDP-9 is also one of the first small or medium scale computers to have a keyboard monitor system based on DIGITAL&#x27;s own small magnetic tape units (DECtape). The PDP-9 established minicomputers as the leading edge of the computer industry.
;PDP-10: Also marketed as the DECsystem-10, this 36-bit timesharing machine (1966) was quite successful over several different implementations (KA, KI, KL, KS) and models. The instruction set is a slightly elaborated form of that of the PDP-6.

:The KL was also used for the DECSYSTEM-20. The KS was used for the 2020, DEC&#x27;s entry in the distributed processing market, introduced as &quot;the world&#x27;s lowest cost mainframe computer system.&quot;
;PDP-11: The archetypal minicomputer (1970); a 16-bit machine and another commercial success for DEC. The LSI-11 is a four-chip PDP-11 used primarily for embedded systems. The 32-bit VAX series is descended from the PDP-11, and early VAX models have a PDP-11 compatibility mode. The 16-bit PDP-11 instruction set has been very influential, with processors ranging from the Motorola 68000 to the Renesas H8 and Texas Instruments MSP430, inspired by its highly orthogonal, general-register oriented instruction set and rich addressing modes. The PDP-11 family was extremely long-lived, spanning 20 years and many different implementations and technologies.
;PDP-12: 12-bit machine (1969), descendant of the LINC-8 and thus of the PDP-8. It had one CPU that could change modes and execute the instruction set of either system. See LINC and PDP-12 User Manual. With slight redesign, and different livery, officially followed by, and marketed as, the &quot;Lab-8&quot;.

;PDP-13: Designation was not used.
;PDP-14: A machine with 12-bit instructions, intended as an industrial controller (PLC; 1969). It has no data memory or data registers; instructions can test Boolean input signals, set or clear Boolean output signals, jump conditional or unconditionally, or call a subroutine. Later versions (for example, the PDP-14/30) are based on PDP-8 physical packaging technology. I/O is line voltage.
;PDP-15: DEC&#x27;s final 18-bit machine (1970). It is the only 18-bit machine constructed from TTL integrated circuits rather than discrete transistors, and, like every DEC 18-bit system (except mandatory on the PDP-1, absent on the PDP-4) has an optional integrated vector graphics terminal, DEC&#x27;s first improvement on its early-designed 34n where n equalled the PDP&#x27;s number. Later versions of the PDP-15 run a real-time multi-user OS called &quot;XVM&quot;. The final model, the PDP-15/76 uses a small PDP-11 to allow Unichannel peripherals to be used.
;PDP-16: A &quot;roll-your-own&quot; digital system using Register Transfer Modules, mainly intended for industrial control systems with more capability than the PDP-14. They could be used to design a custom controller consisting of a control structure and associated data storage and manipulation modules, or to design a small computer which could then be programmed. The PDP-16 modules were based on the RTMs designed by Gordon Bell during his time at CMU. The PDP-16/M was introduced in 1972 as a pre-assembled set of the PDP-16 modules that could be programmed and was nicknamed a &quot;Subminicomputer&quot;.

==Related computers==
* TX-0 designed by MIT&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory, important as influence for DEC products including Ben Gurley&#x27;s design for the PDP-1. When the memory was replaced with a smaller one, the instruction set was expanded, and it was moved to the MIT campus. When a PDP-1 arrived on campus, it was placed in the next room. Software such as an assembler was ported from the TX-0 to the PDP-1 and the machines were connected for communications between them.
* LINC (Laboratory Instrument Computer), originally designed by MIT&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory, some built by DEC. Not in the PDP family, but important as progenitor of the PDP-12. The LINC and the PDP-8 can be considered the first minicomputers, and perhaps the first personal computers as well. The PDP-8 and PDP-11 are the most popular of the PDP series of machines. Digital never made a PDP-20, although the term was sometimes used for a PDP-10 running TOPS-20 (officially known as a DECSYSTEM-20).
* Several unlicensed clones of the PDP-11.
* TOAD-1 and TOAD-2, Foonly, and Systems Concepts PDP-10/DECSYSTEM-20-compatible machines.

<text>A primary mirror (or primary) is the principal light-gathering surface (the objective) of a reflecting telescope.

==Description==
The primary mirror of a reflecting telescope is a spherical, parabolic, or hyperbolic shaped disks of polished reflective metal (speculum metal up to the mid 19th century), or in later telescopes, glass or other material coated with a reflective layer. One of the first known reflecting telescopes, Newton&#x27;s reflector of 1668, used a 3.3 cm polished metal primary mirror. The next major change was to use silver on glass rather than metal, in the 19th century such was with the Crossley reflector. This was changed to vacuum deposited aluminum on glass, used on the 200-inch Hale telescope.

Solid primary mirrors have to sustain their own weight and not deform under gravity, which limits the maximum size for a single piece primary mirror.

Segmented mirror configurations are used to get around the size limitation on single primary mirrors. For example, the Giant Magellan Telescope will have seven 8.4 meter primary mirrors, with the resolving power equivalent to a optical aperture.

==Superlative primary mirrors==

The largest optical telescope in the world as of 2009 to use a non-segmented single-mirror as its primary mirror is the Subaru telescope of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, located in Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii since 1997; however, this is not the largest diameter single mirror in a telescope, the U.S./German/Italian Large Binocular Telescope has two mirrors (which can be used together for interferometric mode). Both of these are smaller than the 10 m segmented primary mirrors on the dual Keck telescope. The Hubble Space Telescope has a primary mirror.

Radio and submillimeter telescopes use much larger dishes or antennae, which do not have to be made as precisely as the mirrors used in optical telescopes. The Arecibo Telescope used a 305 m dish, which was the world largest single-dish radio telescope fixed to the ground. The Green Bank Telescope has the world&#x27;s largest steerable single radio dish with 100 m in diameter. There are larger radio arrays, composed of multiple dishes which have better image resolution but less sensitivity.
