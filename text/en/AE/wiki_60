<text>Newfoundland and Labrador is the easternmost province of Canada, in the country&#x27;s Atlantic region. The province comprises the island of Newfoundland and the continental region of Labrador, having a total size of . As of 2024 the population of Newfoundland and Labrador was estimated to be 545,880. The island of Newfoundland (and its smaller neighbouring islands) is home to around 94 per cent of the province&#x27;s population, with more than half residing in the Avalon Peninsula. Labrador has a land border with both the province of Quebec, as well as a short border with the territory of Nunavut on Killiniq Island. The French overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon lies about west of the Burin Peninsula.

According to the 2016 census, 97.0% of residents reported English as their native language, making Newfoundland and Labrador Canada&#x27;s most linguistically homogeneous province. Much of the population is descended from English and Irish settlers, with the majority immigrating from the early 17th century to the late 19th century.
St. John&#x27;s, the capital and largest city of Newfoundland and Labrador, is Canada&#x27;s 22nd-largest census metropolitan area and home to about 40% of the province&#x27;s population. St. John&#x27;s is the seat of the House of Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador as well as the province&#x27;s highest court, the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal.

Until 1949, the Dominion of Newfoundland was a separate dominion in the British Empire. In 1933, the House of Assembly of the self-governing dominion voted to dissolve itself and to hand over administration of Newfoundland and Labrador to the British-appointed Commission of Government. This followed the suffering caused by the Great Depression and Newfoundland&#x27;s participation in the First World War. On March 31, 1949, it became the 10th and most recent province to join the Canadian Confederation as &quot;Newfoundland&quot;. On December 6, 2001, the Constitution of Canada was amended to change the province&#x27;s name from &quot;Newfoundland&quot; to &quot;Newfoundland and Labrador&quot;.
==Names==
The name &quot;New founde lande&quot; was uttered by King Henry VII about the land explored by Sebastian and John Cabot. In Portuguese, it is (while the province&#x27;s full name is ), which literally means &quot;new land&quot; and is also the French name for the province&#x27;s island region (). The name &quot;Terra Nova&quot; is in wide use on the island (e.g. Terra Nova National Park). The influence of early Portuguese exploration is also reflected in the name of Labrador, which derives from the surname of the Portuguese navigator João Fernandes Lavrador.

Labrador&#x27;s name in the Inuttitut/Inuktitut language (spoken in Nunatsiavut) is (), meaning &quot;the big land&quot; (a common English nickname for Labrador). Newfoundland&#x27;s Inuttitut/Inuktitut name is (), meaning &quot;place of many shoals&quot;. Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s Inuttitut / Inuktitut name is &quot;&quot;.

 is the French name used in the Constitution of Canada. However, French is not widely spoken in Newfoundland and Labrador and is not an official language at the provincial level.

On April 29, 1999, the government of Brian Tobin passed a motion in the Newfoundland House of Assembly requesting the federal government amend the &quot;Newfoundland Act&quot; to change the province&#x27;s name to &quot;Newfoundland and Labrador&quot;. A resolution approving the name change was put forward in the House of Commons in October 2001, introduced by Tobin who had moved to federal politics. Premier Roger Grimes stated: &quot;The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is firmly committed to ensuring official recognition of Labrador as an equal partner in this province, and a constitutional name change of our province will reiterate that commitment&quot;. Following approval by the House of Commons and the Senate, Governor-General Adrienne Clarkson officially proclaimed the name change on December 6, 2001.

==Geography==

Newfoundland and Labrador is the most easterly province in Canada, situated in the northeastern region of North America. The Strait of Belle Isle separates the province into two geographical parts: Labrador, connected to mainland Canada, and Newfoundland, an island in the Atlantic Ocean. The province also includes over 7,000 tiny islands. The highest point of the province is Mount Caubvick with the highest point on Newfoundland being Cabox.

Newfoundland has a roughly triangular shape. Each side is about long, and its area is . Newfoundland and its neighbouring small islands (excluding French possessions) have an area of . Newfoundland extends between latitudes 46°36′N and 51°38′N.

Labrador is also roughly triangular in shape: the western part of its border with Quebec is the drainage divide of the Labrador Peninsula. Lands drained by rivers that flow into the Atlantic Ocean are part of Labrador, and the rest belongs to Quebec. Most of Labrador&#x27;s southern boundary with Quebec follows the 52nd parallel of latitude. Labrador&#x27;s extreme northern tip, at 60°22′N, shares a short border with Nunavut on Killiniq Island. Labrador also has a maritime border with Greenland. Labrador&#x27;s land area (including associated small islands) is . Together, Newfoundland and Labrador make up 4.06 per cent of Canada&#x27;s area, with a total area of .

===Geology===
Labrador is the easternmost part of the Canadian Shield, a vast area of ancient metamorphic rock making up much of northeastern North America. Colliding tectonic plates have shaped much of the geology of Newfoundland. Gros Morne National Park has a reputation as an outstanding example of tectonics at work, and as such has been designated a World Heritage Site. The Long Range Mountains on Newfoundland&#x27;s west coast are the northeasternmost extension of the Appalachian Mountains.

The north-south extent of the province (46°36′N to 60°22′N), prevalent westerly winds, cold ocean currents and local factors such as mountains and coastline combine to create the various climates of the province.

===Climate===
Newfoundland, in broad terms, has a cool summer subtype, with a humid continental climate attributable to its proximity to water — no part of the island is more than from the Atlantic Ocean. However, Northern Labrador is classified as a polar tundra climate, and southern Labrador has a subarctic climate. Newfoundland and Labrador contain a range of climates and weather patterns, including frequent combinations of high winds, snow, rain, and fog, conditions that regularly made travel by road, air, or ferry challenging or impossible.

Monthly average temperatures, rainfall levels, and snowfall levels for four locations are shown in the attached graphs. St. John&#x27;s represents the east coast, Gander the interior of the island, Corner Brook the west coast of the island and Wabush the interior of Labrador. Climate data for 56 places in the province is available from Environment Canada.

The data for the graphs is the average over 30 years. Error bars on the temperature graph indicate the range of daytime highs and night time lows. Snowfall is the total amount that fell during the month, not the amount accumulated on the ground. This distinction is particularly important for St. John&#x27;s, where a heavy snowfall can be followed by rain, so no snow remains on the ground.

Surface water temperatures on the Atlantic side reach a summer average of inshore and offshore to winter lows of inshore and offshore. Sea temperatures on the west coast are warmer than Atlantic side by 1–3 °C (approximately 2–5 °F). The sea keeps winter temperatures slightly higher and summer temperatures a little lower on the coast than inland. The maritime climate produces more variable weather, ample precipitation in a variety of forms, greater humidity, lower visibility, more clouds, less sunshine, and higher winds than a continental climate.

==History==

===Early history and the Beothuks===
==== Dorset culture ====
Human habitation in Newfoundland and Labrador can be traced back about 9,000 years. The Maritime Archaic peoples were sea-mammal hunters in the subarctic. They prospered along the Atlantic Coast of North America from about 7000 BC to 1500 BC. Their settlements included longhouses and boat-topped temporary or seasonal houses. They engaged in long-distance trade, using as currency white chert, a rock quarried from northern Labrador to Maine. The southern branch of these people was established on the north peninsula of Newfoundland by 5,000 years ago. The Maritime Archaic period is best known from a mortuary site in Newfoundland at Port au Choix.

The Maritime Archaic peoples were gradually displaced by people of the Dorset culture (Late Paleo-Eskimo) who also occupied Port au Choix. The number of their sites discovered on Newfoundland indicates they may have been the most numerous Aboriginal people to live there. They thrived from about 2000 BC to 800 AD. Many of their sites were on exposed headlands and outer islands. They were more oriented to the sea than earlier peoples, and had developed sleds and boats similar to kayaks. They burned seal blubber in soapstone lamps.

Many of these sites, such as Port au Choix, recently excavated by Memorial archaeologist, Priscilla Renouf, are quite large and show evidence of a long-term commitment to place. Renouf has excavated huge amounts of harp seal bones at Port au Choix, indicating that this place was a prime location for the hunting of these animals.

The people of the Dorset culture (800 BC – 1500 AD) were highly adapted to a cold climate, and much of their food came from hunting sea mammals through holes in the ice. The massive decline in sea ice during the Medieval Warm Period would have had a devastating effect upon their way of life.

==== Beothuk settlement ====

The appearance of the Beothuk culture is believed to be the most recent cultural manifestation of peoples who first migrated from Labrador to Newfoundland around 1 AD. The Inuit, found mostly in Labrador, are the descendants of what anthropologists call the Thule people, who emerged from western Alaska around 1000 AD and spread eastwards across the High Arctic tundra reaching Labrador around 1300–1500. Researchers believe the Dorset culture lacked the dogs, larger weapons and other technologies that gave the expanding Inuit an advantage.

The inhabitants eventually organized themselves into small bands of a few families, grouped into larger tribes and chieftainships. The Innu are the inhabitants of an area they refer to as &quot;Nitassinan&quot;, i.e. most of what is now referred to as northeastern Quebec and Labrador. Their subsistence activities were historically centered on hunting and trapping caribou, deer and small game. Coastal clans also practiced agriculture, fished and managed maple sugar bush. The Innu engaged in tribal warfare along the coast of Labrador with Inuit groups that had large populations.

The Miꞌkmaq of southern Newfoundland spent most of their time on the shores harvesting seafood; during the winter they would move inland to the woods to hunt. Over time, the Miꞌkmaq and Innu divided their lands into traditional &quot;districts&quot;. Each district was independently governed and had a district chief and a council. The council members were band chiefs, elders and other worthy community leaders. In addition to the district councils, the Miꞌkmaq tribes also developed a Grand Council or &quot;Santé Mawiómi&quot;, which according to oral tradition was formed before 1600.

==== European contact ====
The oldest confirmed accounts of European contact date from a thousand years ago as described in the Viking (Norse) Icelandic Sagas. Around the year 1001, the sagas refer to Leif Erikson landing in three places to the west, the first two being Helluland (possibly Baffin Island) and Markland (possibly Labrador). Leif&#x27;s third landing was at a place he called Vinland (possibly Newfoundland). Archaeological evidence of a Norse settlement was found in L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1978.

There are several other unconfirmed accounts of European discovery and exploration, one tale of men from the Channel Islands being blown off course in the late 15th century into a strange land full of fish, and another from Portuguese maps that depict the Terra do Bacalhau, or land of codfish, west of the Azores. The earliest, though, is the Voyage of Saint Brendan, the fantastical account of an Irish monk who made a sea voyage in the early 6th century. While the story became a part of myth and legend, some historians believe it is based on fact.

In 1496, John Cabot obtained a charter from English King Henry VII to &quot;sail to all parts, countries and seas of the East, the West and of the North, under our banner and ensign and to set up our banner on any new-found-land&quot; and on June 24, 1497, landed in Cape Bonavista. Historians disagree on whether Cabot landed in Nova Scotia in 1497 or in Newfoundland, or possibly Maine, if he landed at all, but the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom recognise Bonavista as being Cabot&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; landing place. In 1499 and 1500, Portuguese mariners João Fernandes Lavrador and Pero de Barcelos explored and mapped the coast, the former&#x27;s name appearing as &quot;Labrador&quot; on topographical maps of the period.

Based on the Treaty of Tordesillas, the Portuguese Crown claimed it had territorial rights in the area John Cabot visited in 1497 and 1498. Subsequently, in 1501 and 1502, the Corte-Real brothers, Miguel and Gaspar, explored Newfoundland and Labrador, claiming them as part of the Portuguese Empire. In 1506, king Manuel I of Portugal created taxes for the cod fisheries in Newfoundland waters. João Álvares Fagundes and Pero de Barcelos established seasonal fishing outposts in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia around 1521, and older Portuguese settlements may have existed. 

By the time regular European contact with Newfoundland began in the early 16th century, the Beothuk were the only indigenous group living permanently on the island. Unlike other groups in the Northeastern area of the Americas, the Beothuk never established sustained trading relations with European settlers. Their interactions were sporadic, and they largely attempted to avoid contact. The establishment of English fishing operations on the outer coastline of the island, and their later expansion into bays and inlets, cut off access for the Beothuk to their traditional sources of food.

In the 18th century, as the Beothuk were driven further inland by these encroachments, violence between Beothuk and settlers escalated, with each retaliating against the other in their competition for resources. By the early 19th century, violence, starvation, and exposure to tuberculosis had decimated the Beothuk population, and they were extinct by 1829.

===European settlement and conflict ===
Sometime before 1563, Basque fishermen, who had been fishing cod shoals off Newfoundland&#x27;s coasts since the beginning of the sixteenth century, founded Plaisance (today Placentia), a seasonal haven which French fishermen later used. In the Newfoundland will of the Basque seaman Domingo de Luca, dated 1563 and now in an archive in Spain, he asks &quot;that my body be buried in this port of Plazençia in the place where those who die here are usually buried&quot;. This will is the oldest-known civil document written in Canada.

Twenty years later, in 1583, Newfoundland became England&#x27;s first possession in North America and one of the earliest permanent English colonies in the New World when Sir Humphrey Gilbert, provided with letters patent from Queen Elizabeth I, landed in St. John&#x27;s. European fishing boats had visited Newfoundland continuously since Cabot&#x27;s second voyage in 1498 and seasonal fishing camps had existed for a century prior. Fishing boats originated from Basque country, England, France, and Portugal.

In 1585, during the initial stages of Anglo-Spanish War, Bernard Drake led a devastating raid on the Spanish and Portuguese fisheries. This provided an opportunity to secure the island and led to the appointment of Proprietary Governors to establish colonial settlements on the island from 1610 to 1728. John Guy became governor of the first settlement at Cuper&#x27;s Cove. Other settlements included Bristol&#x27;s Hope, Renews, New Cambriol, South Falkland and Avalon (which became a province in 1623). The first governor given jurisdiction over all of Newfoundland was Sir David Kirke in 1638.

Explorers quickly realized the waters around Newfoundland had the best fishing in the North Atlantic. By 1620, 300 fishing boats worked the Grand Banks, employing some 10,000 sailors; many continuing to come from the Basque Country, Normandy, or Brittany. They dried and salted cod on the coast and sold it to Spain and Portugal. Heavy investment by Sir George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, in the 1620s in wharves, warehouses, and fishing stations failed to pay off. French raids hurt the business, and the weather was terrible, so he redirected his attention to his other colony in Maryland. After Calvert left, small-scale entrepreneurs such as Sir David Kirke made good use of the facilities. Kirke became the first governor of Newfoundland in 1638.

==== Triangular Trade ====

A triangular trade with New England, the West Indies, and Europe gave Newfoundland an important economic role. By the 1670s, there were 1,700 permanent residents and another 4,500 in the summer months.

This trade relied upon the labour of enslaved people of African descent. Salted cod from Newfoundland was used to feed the enslaved persons of African descent on plantations in the West Indies. Products typically associated with Newfoundland such as molasses and rum (Screech), were produced by the enslaved persons of African descent on plantations in the West Indies, and shipped to Newfoundland and England on merchant ships. Some merchants in Newfoundland enslaved persons of African descent such as St. John&#x27;s merchant, Thomas Oxford. John Ryan, merchant and publisher of the Royal Gazette and Newfoundland Advertiser, who resided in New Brunswick and Newfoundland, freed his enslaved servant Dinah, upon his death in Newfoundland in 1847, notably after the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833.

Notably, the Kirke brothers who were merchants in the triangular trade, brought Olivier Le Jeune to New France, where he was sold in 1629.

In 1655, France appointed a governor in Plaisance (Placentia), the former Basque fishing settlement, thus starting a formal French colonization period in Newfoundland as well as a period of periodic war and unrest between England and France in the region. The Miꞌkmaq, as allies of the French, were amenable to limited French settlement in their midst and fought alongside them against the English. English attacks on Placentia provoked retaliation by New France explorer Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville who during King William&#x27;s War in the 1690s, destroyed nearly every English settlement on the island. The entire population of the English colony was either killed, captured for ransom, or sentenced to expulsion to England, with the exception of those who withstood the attack at Carbonear Island and those in the then remote Bonavista.

After France lost political control of the area after the Siege of Port Royal in 1710, the Miꞌkmaq engaged in warfare with the British throughout Dummer&#x27;s War (1722–1725), King George&#x27;s War (1744–1748), Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War (1749–1755) and the French and Indian War (1754–1763). The French colonization period lasted until the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, which ended the War of the Spanish Succession: France ceded to the British its claims to Newfoundland (including its claims to the shores of Hudson Bay) and to the French possessions in Acadia. Afterward, under the supervision of the last French governor, the French population of Plaisance moved to Île Royale (now Cape Breton Island), part of Acadia which remained then under French control.

In the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), France had acknowledged British ownership of the island. However, in the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), control of Newfoundland once again became a major source of conflict between Britain, France and Spain, who all pressed for a share in the valuable fishery there. Britain&#x27;s victories around the globe led William Pitt to insist nobody other than Britain should have access to Newfoundland. The Battle of Signal Hill was fought on September 15, 1762, and was the last battle of the North American theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War. A British force under Lieutenant Colonel William Amherst recaptured St. John&#x27;s, which the French had seized three months earlier in a surprise attack.

From 1763 to 1767, James Cook made a detailed survey of the coasts of Newfoundland and southern Labrador while commander of . (The following year, 1768, Cook began his first circumnavigation of the world.) In 1796, a Franco-Spanish expedition again succeeded in raiding the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, destroying many of the settlements.

By the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), French fishermen gained the right to land and cure fish on the &quot;French Shore&quot; on the western coast. (They had a permanent base on the nearby St. Pierre and Miquelon islands; the French gave up their French Shore rights in 1904.) In 1783, the British signed the Treaty of Paris with the United States that gave American fishermen similar rights along the coast. These rights were reaffirmed by treaties in 1818, 1854 and 1871, and confirmed by arbitration in 1910.

=== British colony ===

==== The United Irish Conspiracy and Catholic Emancipation ====
The founding proprietor of the Province of Avalon, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, intended that it should serve as a refuge for his persecuted Roman Catholic co-religionists. But like his other colony in the Province of Maryland on the American mainland, it soon passed out of the Calvert family&#x27;s control. The majority Catholic population that developed, thanks to Irish immigration, in St. John&#x27;s and the Avalon Peninsula, was subjected to the same disabilities that applied elsewhere under the British Crown. On visiting St. John&#x27;s in 1786, Prince William Henry (the future King William IV) noted that &quot;there are ten Roman Catholics to one Protestant&quot;, and he counselled against any measure of Catholic relief.

Following news of rebellion in Ireland, in June 1798, Governor Vice-Admiral Waldegrave cautioned London that the English constituted but a &quot;small proportion&quot; of the locally raised Regiment of Foot. In an echo of an earlier Irish conspiracy during the French occupation of St. John&#x27;s in 1762, in April 1800, the authorities had reports that upwards of 400 men had taken an oath as United Irishmen, and that eighty soldiers were committed to killing their officers and seizing their Anglican governors at Sunday service.

The abortive mutiny, for which eight men (denounced by Catholic Bishop James Louis O&#x27;Donel as &quot;favourers of the infidel French&quot;) were hanged, may have been less a United Irish plot, than an act of desperation in the face of brutal living conditions and officer tyranny. Many of the Irish reserve soldiers were forced to remain on duty, unable to return to the fisheries that supported their families. Yet the Newfoundland Irish would have been aware of the agitation in the homeland for civil equality and political rights. There were reports of communication with United men in Ireland from before &#x27;98 rebellion; of Thomas Paine&#x27;s pamphlets circulating in St. John&#x27;s; and, despite the war with France, of hundreds of young County Waterford men still making a seasonal migration to the island for the fisheries, among them defeated rebels, said to have &quot;added fuel to the fire&quot; of local grievance.

When news reached Newfoundland in May 1829 that the UK Parliament had finally conceded Catholic emancipation, the locals assumed that Catholics would now pass unhindered into the ranks of public office and enjoy equality with Protestants. There was a celebratory parade and mass in St. John&#x27;s, and a gun salute from vessels in the harbour. But the attorney general and supreme court justices determined that as Newfoundland was a colony, and not a province of the United Kingdom, the Roman Catholic Relief Act did not apply. The discrimination was a matter of local ordinance.

It was not until May 1832 that the British Secretary of State for the Colonies formally stated that a new commission would be issued to Governor Cochrane to remove any and all Roman Catholic disabilities in Newfoundland. By then Catholic emancipation was bound up (as in Ireland) with the call for home rule.

==== Achievement of home rule ====
After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, France and other nations re-entered the fish trade and an abundance of cod glutted international markets. Prices dropped, competition increased, and the colony&#x27;s profits evaporated. A string of harsh winters between 1815 and 1817 made living conditions even more difficult, while fires at St. John&#x27;s in 1817 left thousands homeless. At the same time a new wave of immigration from Ireland increased the Catholic population. In these circumstances much of the English and Protestant proprietor class tended to shelter behind the appointed, and Anglican, &quot;naval government&quot;.

A broad home-rule coalition of Irish community leaders and (Scottish and Welsh) Methodists formed in 1828. Expressing, initially, the concerns of a new middle class over taxation, it was led by William Carson, a Scottish physician, and Patrick Morris, an Irish merchant. In 1825, the British government granted Newfoundland and Labrador official colonial status and appointed Sir Thomas Cochrane as its first civil governor. Partly carried by the wave of reform in Britain, a colonial legislature in St. John&#x27;s, together with the promise of Catholic emancipation, followed in 1832. Carson made his goal for Newfoundland clear: &quot;We shall rise into a national existence, having a national character, a nation&#x27;s feelings, assuming that rank among our neighbours which the political situation and the extent of our island demand&quot;.

Standing as Liberals, the reformers sought to break the Anglican monopoly on government patronage and to tax the fisheries to fund the judiciary, road-building projects, and other expenses. They were opposed by the Conservatives (the &quot;Tories&quot;), who largely represented the Anglican establishment and mercantile interests. While Tories dominated the governor&#x27;s appointed Executive Council, Liberals generally held the majority of seats in the elected House of Assembly.

Economic conditions remained harsh. As in Ireland, the potato which made possible a steady growth in population failed as a result of the &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot; blight. The number of deaths from the 1846–1848 Newfoundland potato famine remains unknown, but there was pervasive hunger. Along with other half-hearted measures to relieve the distress, Governor John Gaspard Le Marchant declared a &quot;Day of Public Fasting and Humiliation&quot; in hopes the Almighty might pardon their sins and &quot;withdraw his afflicting hand.&quot; The wave of post-famine emigration from Ireland notably passed over Newfoundland.

==== Era of responsible government ====
Fisheries revived, and the devolution of responsibilities from London continued. In 1854, the British government established Newfoundland&#x27;s first responsible government, an executive accountable to the colonial legislature. In 1855, with an Assembly majority, the Liberals under Philip Francis Little (the first Roman Catholic to practise law in St. John&#x27;s) formed Newfoundland&#x27;s first parliamentary government (1855–1858). Newfoundland rejected confederation with Canada in the 1869 general election. The Islanders were preoccupied with land issues—the Escheat movement with its call to suppress absentee landlordism in favour of the tenant farmer. Canada offered little in the way of solutions.

From the 1880s, as cod fishery fell into severe decline, there was large-scale emigration. While some people, working abroad, left their homes on a seasonal or temporary basis more began to leave permanently. Most emigrants (largely Catholic and of Irish descent) moved to Canada, many to find work in the steel plants and coal mines of Nova Scotia. There was also a considerable outflow to the United States and, in particular, to New England.

In 1892, St. John&#x27;s burned. The Great Fire left 12,000 homeless. In 1894, the two commercial banks in Newfoundland collapsed. These bankruptcies left a vacuum that was subsequently filled by Canadian chartered banks, a change that subordinated Newfoundland to Canadian monetary policies.

Newfoundland lay outside the direct route of world traffic. St. John&#x27;s, from Liverpool and about 1,000 miles from the east-coast American cities, was not a port of call for Atlantic liners. But with the co-ordination and extension of the railway system, new prospects for development opened in the interior. Paper and pulp mills were established by the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Co. at Grand Falls for the supply of the publishing empires in the UK of Lord Northcliffe and Lord Rothermere. Iron ore mines were established at Bell Island.

===British Dominion ===

==== Reform and the Fisherman&#x27;s Union ====
In 1907, Newfoundland acquired dominion status, or self-government, within the British Empire or British Commonwealth. Government of Newfoundland was conducted mostly by a cabinet accountable solely to the legislature in St. John&#x27;s, subject only to occasional policy changes from the British government, for example vetoing a trade agreement Newfoundland had negotiated with the United States. A new reform-minded government was formed under Edward Morris, a senior Catholic politician who had split from the Liberals to form the People&#x27;s Party. It extended education provision, introduced old-age pensions, initiated agriculture and trade schemes and, with a trade union act, provided a legal framework for collective bargaining.

There had been unions seeking to negotiate wage rates in the shipbuilding trades since the 1850s. Those working the fishing boats were not wage earners but commodity producers, like farmers, reliant on merchant credit. Working in small, competitive, often family, units, scattered in isolated communities, they also had little occasion to gather in large numbers to discuss common concerns. These obstacles to organization were overcome from 1908 by a new co-operative movement, the Fishermen&#x27;s Protective Union (FPU). Mobilizing more than 21,000 members in 206 councils across the island; more than half of Newfoundland&#x27;s fishermen, the FPU challenged the economic control of the island&#x27;s merchantocracy. Despite opposition from the Catholic Church which objected to the FPU&#x27;s oath taking and alleged socialism, led by William Coaker the candidates for the FPU won 8 of 36 seats in the House of Assembly in the 1913 general election.

At the beginning of 1914, economic conditions seemed favourable to reform. In a little over a decade, exports, imports and state revenue had more than doubled. Schemes were afoot for the exploitation of coal and mineral resources, and for the utilisation of peat beds for fuel. Benefiting from the settlement of disputes over fishing rights with France in 1904, and with the New England states in 1910, the fishing industry was looking to develop new markets.

====First World War and its aftermath====

In August 1914, Britain declared war on Germany. Out of a total population of about 250,000, Newfoundland offered up some 12,000 men for Imperial service (including 3,000 who joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force). About a third of these were to serve in 1st Newfoundland Regiment, which after service in the Gallipoli Campaign, was nearly wiped out at Beaumont-Hamel on the first day on the Somme, July 1, 1916. The regiment, which the Dominion government had chosen to raise, equip, and train at its own expense, was resupplied and went on to serve with distinction in several subsequent battles, earning the prefix &quot;Royal&quot;. The overall fatality and casualty rate for the regiment was high: 1,281 dead, 2,284 wounded.

The FPU members joined Edward Patrick Morris&#x27; wartime National Government of 1917, but their reputation suffered when they failed to abide by their promise not to support military conscription without a referendum. In 1919, the FPU joined with the Liberals to form the Liberal Reform Party whose success in the 1919 general election allowed Coaker to continue as Fisheries Minister. But there was little he could do to sustain the credibility of the FPU in the face of the post-war slump in fish prices, and the subsequent high unemployment and emigration. At the same time the Dominion&#x27;s war debt due to the regiment and the cost of the trans-island railway, limited the government&#x27;s ability to provide relief.

In the spring of 1918, in midst of disquiet over wartime inflation and profiteering, there had been protest. The Newfoundland Industrial Workers&#x27; Association (NIWA) struck both the rail and steamship operations of the Reid Newfoundland Company, effectively isolating the capital and threatening the annual seal hunt. Central to the eventual settlement were not only wage increases, but &quot;the great principle that employees are entitled to be heard in all matters connected with their welfare&quot;.

When in January 1919, Sinn Féin formed the Dáil Éireann in Dublin, the Irish question and local sectarian tensions resurfaced in Newfoundland. In the course of 1920 many Catholics of Irish descent in St. John&#x27;s joined the local branch of the Self-Determination for Ireland League (SDIL). Although tempered by expressions of loyalty to the Empire, the League&#x27;s vocal support for Irish self-government was opposed by the local Orange Order. Claiming to represent 20,000 &quot;loyal citizens&quot;, the Order was composed almost exclusively of Anglicans or Methodists of English descent. Tensions ran sufficiently high that Catholic Archbishop Edward Roche felt constrained to caution League organisers against the hazards of &quot;a sectarian war.&quot;

Since the early 1800s, Newfoundland and Quebec (or Lower Canada) had been in a border dispute over the Labrador region. In 1927, the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled that the area known as modern-day Labrador was to be considered part of the Dominion of Newfoundland.

===Commission government ===

==== The Great Depression and the return of colonial rule ====

Following the stock market crash in 1929, the international market for much of Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s goods—saltfish, pulp paper and minerals—decreased dramatically. In 1930, the country earned $40 million from its exports; that number dropped to $23.3 million in 1933. The fishery suffered particularly heavy losses as salted cod that sold for $8.90 a quintal in 1929 fetched only half that amount by 1932. With this precipitous loss of export income, the level of debt Newfoundland carried from the Great War and from construction of the Newfoundland Railway proved unsustainable. In 1931, the Dominion defaulted. Newfoundland survived with assistance from the United Kingdom and Canada but, in the summer of 1933, faced with unprecedented economic problems at home, Canada decided against any further support.

Following retrenchment in all the Dominion&#x27;s major industries, the government laid off close to one third of its civil servants and cut the wages of those it retained. For the first time since the 1880s, malnutrition was facilitating the spread of beriberi, tuberculosis and other diseases.

The British had a stark choice: accept financial collapse in Newfoundland or pay the full cost of keeping the country solvent. The solution, accepted by the legislature in 1933, was to accept a de facto return to direct colonial rule. In exchange for loan guarantees by the Crown and a promise that self-government would in time be re-established, the legislature in St. John&#x27;s voted itself out of existence. On February 16, 1934, the Commission of Government was sworn in, ending 79 years of responsible government. The Commission consisted of seven persons appointed by the British government. For 15 years, no elections took place, and no legislature was convened.

Between 1934 and 1939, the Commission of Government managed the situation but the underlying problem, world-wide depression, resisted solution. The dispirited state of the country is said to have been evident in &quot;&#x27;the lack of cheering and of visible enthusiasm&#x27; in the crowds that came out to see King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during their brief visit in June 1939.&quot;

====Second World War====
The situation changed dramatically, after Newfoundland and Labrador, with no responsible government of its own, was automatically committed to war as a result of Britain&#x27;s ultimatum to Germany in September 1939. Unlike in 1914–1918, when the Dominion government volunteered and financed a full expeditionary regiment, there would be no separate presence overseas and, by implication, no compulsory enlistment. Volunteers filled the ranks of Newfoundland units in both the Royal Artillery and the Royal Air Force, and of the largest single contingent of Newfoundlanders to go overseas, the Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit. As a result, and taking into account service in the Newfoundland Militia, and in the merchant marine, as in the First World War about 12,000 Newfoundlanders were at one time or another directly or indirectly involved in the war effort.

In June 1940, following the defeat of France and the German occupation of most of Western Europe, the Commission of Government, with British approval, authorized Canadian forces to help defend Newfoundland&#x27;s air bases for the duration of the war. Canada&#x27;s military commitment greatly increased in 1941 when German submarines began to attack the large numbers of merchant ships in the north-west Atlantic. In addition to reinforcing the bomber squadron at Gander, the Royal Canadian Air Force provided a further squadron of bombers that flew from a new airport Canada built at Torbay (the present St. John&#x27;s airport). From November 1940, a new airbase at Gander became one of the so called &quot;sally-ports of freedom&quot; with U.S. manufactured aircraft flying in swarms to Britain.

Already, in March 1941, United Kingdom conceded the United States, then still officially neutral, what were effectively U.S. sovereign base rights. The Americans chose properties at St. John&#x27;s, where they established an army base (Fort Pepperrell) and a dock facility; at Argentia/Marquise, where they built a naval air base and an army base (Fort McAndrew); and at Stephenville, where they built a large airfield (Ernest Harmon Airbase). As allies after December 1941, the Americans were also accommodated at Torbay, Goose Bay and Gander.

This garrisoning of Newfoundland had profound economic, political and social consequences. Enlistment for service abroad and the base building boom at home eliminated the chronic unemployment of the previous decades. By 1942, the country not only enjoyed full employment and could spend more on health, education and housing, it was making interest-free loans of Canadian dollars to the by-then hard-pressed British. At the same time, the presence of so many Canadians and Americans, complete with entertainment and consumer goods, promoted a taste for the more affluent consumerism that had been developing throughout North America.

==== The National Convention ====
When prosperity returned with the Second World War, agitation began to end the Commission and reinstate responsible government. Instead, the British government created the National Convention in 1946. Chaired by Judge Cyril J. Fox, the Convention consisted of 45 elected members from across the dominion and was formally tasked with advising on the future of Newfoundland.

Several motions were made by Joey Smallwood (a convention member who later served as the first provincial premier of Newfoundland) to examine joining Canada by sending a delegation to Ottawa. The first motion was defeated, although the Convention later decided to send delegations to both London and Ottawa to explore alternatives. In January 1948, the National Convention voted against adding the issue of Confederation to the referendum 29 to 16, but the British, who controlled the National Convention and the subsequent referendum, overruled this move. Those who supported Confederation were extremely disappointed with the recommendations of the National Convention and organized a petition, signed by more than 50,000 Newfoundlanders, demanding that Confederation with Canada be placed before the people in the upcoming referendum. As most historians agree, the British government keenly wanted Confederation on the ballot and ensured its inclusion.

=== Canadian province ===

==== The referendums on confederation ====

Three main factions actively campaigned during the lead-up to the referendums on confederation with Canada:

* The Confederate Association (CA), led by Smallwood, advocated entry into the Canadian Confederation. They campaigned through a newspaper known as &quot;The Confederate&quot;.
* The Responsible Government League (RGL), led by Peter Cashin, advocated an independent Newfoundland with a return to responsible government. Their newspaper was &quot;The Independent&quot;.
* The smaller Economic Union Party (EUP), led by Chesley Crosbie, advocated closer economic ties with the United States. A 1947 Gallup poll found 80% of Newfoundland residents wanting to become Americans, but the United States had no interest in the proposal, and preferred Newfoundland join Canada. The EUP failed to gain much support and after the first referendum merged with the RGL.

The first referendum took place on June 3, 1948; 44.6 per cent of people voted for responsible government, 41.1 per cent voted for confederation with Canada, while 14.3 per cent voted for the Commission of Government. Since none of the choices had gained more than 50%, a second referendum with only the two more popular choices was held on July 22, 1948. The official outcome of that referendum was 52.3 per cent for confederation with Canada and 47.7 per cent for responsible (independent) government. After the referendum, the British governor named a seven-man delegation to negotiate Canada&#x27;s offer on behalf of Newfoundland. After six of the delegation signed, the British government passed the British North America Act, 1949 through the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Newfoundland officially joined Canada at midnight on March 31, 1949.

As documents in British and Canadian archives became available in the 1980s, it became evident that both Canada and the United Kingdom had wanted Newfoundland to join Canada. Some have charged it was a conspiracy to manoeuvre Newfoundland into Confederation in exchange for forgiveness of Britain&#x27;s war debt and for other considerations. Yet, most historians who have examined the relevant documents have concluded that, while Britain engineered the inclusion of a Confederation option in the referendum, Newfoundlanders made the final decision themselves, if by a narrow margin.

Following the referendum, there was a rumour that the referendum had been narrowly won by the &quot;responsible government&quot; side, but that the result had been fixed by the British governor. Shortly after the referendum, several boxes of ballots from St. John&#x27;s were burned by order of Herman William Quinton, one of only two commissioners who supported confederation. Some have argued that independent oversight of the vote tallying was lacking, though the process was supervised by respected Corner Brook Magistrate Nehemiah Short, who had also overseen elections to the National Convention.

==== 1959 Woodworkers&#x27; strike ====
In 1959, a strike led by the International Woodworkers of America (IWA) that resulted the &quot;most bitter labour dispute in Newfoundland&#x27;s history.&quot; Smallwood, although he had himself been an organizer in the lumber industry, feared that the strike would shut down what had become the province&#x27;s largest employer. His government introduced emergency legislation that immediately decertified the IWA, prohibited secondary picketing, and made unions liable for illegal acts committed on their behalf.

The International Labour Organization, Canadian Labour Congress, and the Newfoundland Federation of Labour condemned the legislation, and Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker refused to provide the province with additional police to enforce the legislation. But running out of food and money, the loggers eventually abandoned the strike, joined Smallwood&#x27;s newly created Newfoundland Brotherhood of Wood Workers, and negotiated a settlement with the logging companies, ending the strike and effectively undermining the IWA.

==== Resettlement programs ====
From the early 1950s, the provincial government pursued a policy of population transfer by centralizing the rural population. A resettlement of the many isolated communities scattered along Newfoundland&#x27;s coasts was seen as a way to save rural Newfoundland by moving people to what were referred to as &quot;growth centres&quot;. It was believed this would allow the government to provide more and better public services such as education, health care, roads and electricity. The resettlement policy was also expected to create more employment opportunities outside of the fishery, or in spinoff industries, which meant a stronger and more modern fishing industry for those remaining in it.

Three attempts of resettlement were initiated by the Government between 1954 and 1975 which resulted in the abandonment of 300 communities and nearly 30,000 people moved. Denounced as poorly resourced and as an historic injustice, resettlement has been viewed as possibly the most controversial government policy of the post-Confederation Newfoundland and Labrador.

Many of the remaining small rural outports were hit by the 1992 cod moratorium. Loss of an important source of income caused widespread out-migration. In the 21st century, the Community Relocation Policy allows for voluntary relocation of isolated settlements. Eight communities have moved between 2002 and 2018. At the end of 2019, the decommissioning of ferry and hydroelectricity services ended settlement on the Little Bay Islands.

===21st century===

==== Climate change ====
In the new century, the provincial government is anticipating the challenges of global warming. Locally average annual temperatures are variously estimated to be already between 0.8 °C and 1.5 °C above historical norms and the frequency of hurricanes and tropical storms have doubled in comparison to the last century. As a result, the province is experiencing increased permafrost melt, flooding, and infrastructure damage, reduced sea ice, and greater risk from new invasive species and infectious diseases.

The government believes that in just fifty years (2000–2050), temperatures in Newfoundland will have risen by two and a half to three degrees in summer and three and a half to five degrees in winter, and that in Labrador warming will be even more severe. Under those conditions the winter season could shorten by as much as four to five weeks in some locations and that extreme storm events could result in an increase of precipitation by over 20% or more, enhancing the likelihood and magnitude of flooding. Meanwhile, sea levels are anticipated to rise by a half meter, putting coastal infrastructure at risk. Against these hazards, the government sets the province&#x27;s &quot;vast renewable [wind, sea and hydro] energy resources&quot; with their potential to reduce carbon emissions in the province and elsewhere.

In April 2023, following years of delays and billions of dollars in cost overruns, a major hydro-generation project at Muskrat Falls, was declared complete with the final testing of the 1,100 km transmission link from the site in Labrador to a converter station outside St John&#x27;s. Theoretically it could replace all the province&#x27;s existing hydro-carbon sources of electricity. On the other hand, critics note that, in the decade to 2030, the government plans to double offshore oil production, significantly adding to emissions.

On January 17, 2020, the province experienced a large blizzard, nicknamed &#x27;Snowmageddon&#x27;, with winds up to . The communities of St. John&#x27;s, Mount Pearl, Paradise, and Torbay declared a state of emergency. On January 18, 2020, Premier Dwight Ball said his request for aid from the Canadian Armed Forces was approved, and troops from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, CFB Halifax, and CFB Gagetown would arrive in the province to assist with snow-clearing and emergency services. An avalanche hit a house in The Battery section of St. John&#x27;s. St. John&#x27;s mayor Danny Breen said the storm cost the city $7 million.

==== The COVID-19 pandemic ====
The COVID-19 pandemic in Newfoundland and Labrador is ongoing. The province announced its first presumptive case on March 14, 2020, and declared a public health emergency on March 18. Health orders, including the closure of non-essential businesses and mandatory self-isolation for all travellers entering the province (including from within Canada), were enacted over the days that followed.

The emergency and all COVID-related restrictions ended in February 2022. There had been 18,464 recorded cases of persons testing positive for the virus, including 46 deaths.

== Demographics ==


=== Population ===
As of October 1, 2021, Newfoundland and Labrador had a population of 521,758. More than half the population lives on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, site of the capital and historical early settlement. Since 2006, the population of the province has started to increase for the first time since the early 1990s. In the 2006 census, the population of the province decreased by 1.5% compared to 2001 and stood at 505,469. But, by the 2011 census, the population had risen by 1.8%.

At the beginning of 2021, Newfoundland and Labrador started accepting applications for a Priority Skills immigration program. Focusing on highly educated, highly skilled newcomers with specialized experience in areas where demand has outpaced local training and recruitment, such as technology and ocean sciences occupations, the government hopes the program will attract 2,500 new permanent residents annually.

=== Ethnicity ===
According to the 2001 Canadian census, the largest ethnic group in Newfoundland and Labrador is English (39.4%), followed by Irish (19.7%), Scots (6.0%), French (5.5%) and First Nations (3.2%). While half of all respondents also identified their ethnicity as &quot;Canadian&quot;, 38 per cent report their ethnicity as &quot;Newfoundlander&quot; in a 2003 Statistics Canada Ethnic Diversity Survey.

During the initial registration phase for the Qalipu Miꞌkmaq First Nation Band in 2013, more than 100,000 Newfoundlanders applied for membership (equivalent to one-fifth of the total population). The subsequent process led to around 24,000 people being recognised as members of the Qalipu First Nation.

=== Language ===
As of the 2021 Canadian Census, the ten most spoken languages in the province included English (501,135 or 99.81%), French (26,130 or 5.2%), Arabic (2,195 or 0.44%), Spanish (2,085 or 0.42%), Innu (Montagnais) (1,925 or 0.38%), Tagalog (1,810 or 0.36%), Hindi (1,565 or 0.31%), Mandarin (1,170 or 0.23%), German (1,075 or 0.21%), and Punjabi (1,040 or 0.21%). The question on knowledge of languages allows for multiple responses.

Newfoundland English is a term referring to any of several accents and dialects of the English language found in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Most of these differ substantially from the English commonly spoken elsewhere in neighbouring Canada and the North Atlantic. Many Newfoundland dialects are similar to the dialects of the West Country in England, particularly the city of Bristol and counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire and Somerset, while other Newfoundland dialects resemble those of Ireland&#x27;s southeastern counties, particularly Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and Cork. Still others blend elements of both, and there is also a discernible influence of Scottish English. While the Scots came in smaller numbers than the English and Irish, they had a large influence on Newfoundland society.

Local place names in the Irish language include Newfoundland (&quot;Talamh an Éisc&quot;, &quot;Land of the Fish&quot;) and St. John&#x27;s (&quot;Baile Sheáin&quot;) Ballyhack (&quot;Baile Hac&quot;), Cappahayden (&quot;Ceapach Éidín&quot;), Kilbride and St. Bride&#x27;s (&quot;Cill Bhríde&quot;), Duntara, Port Kirwan and Skibbereen (&quot;Scibirín&quot;). While the distinct local dialect of the Irish language in Newfoundland is now extinct, the language is still taught locally and the Gaelic revival organization remains active in the province. A distinct local dialect of Scots Gaelic was also once spoken in the Codroy Valley of Newfoundland, following the settlement there, from the middle of the 19th century, of Canadian Gaelic-speakers from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Some 150 years later, the language has not entirely disappeared, although it no longer has any fluent speakers. In Canadian Gaelic, the two main names for Newfoundland are &quot;Talamh an Èisg&quot; and &quot;Eilein a&#x27; Trosg&quot;.

A community of Newfoundland French speakers still exists on the Port au Port Peninsula—a remnant of the &quot;French Shore&quot; along the island&#x27;s west coast.

Several indigenous languages are spoken in the Province, representing the Algonquian (Miꞌkmaq and Innu) and Eskimo-Aleut (Inuktitut) linguistic families.

Languages of the population – mother tongue (2011)
=== Religion ===

According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Newfoundland and Labrador included:
*Christianity (413,915 persons or 82.4%)
*Irreligion (80,330 persons or 16.0%)
*Islam (3,995 persons or 0.8%)
*Hinduism (1,200 persons or 0.2%)
*Sikhism (855 persons or 0.2%)
*Buddhism (490 persons or 0.1%)
*Judaism (240 persons or &lt;0.1%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (105 persons or &lt;0.1%)
*Other (965 persons or 0.2%)

The largest single religious denomination by number of adherents according to the 2011 National Household Survey was the Roman Catholic Church, at 35.8% of the province&#x27;s population (181,590 members). The major Protestant denominations made up 57.3% of the population, with the largest groups being the Anglican Church of Canada at 25.1% of the total population (127,255 members), the United Church of Canada at 15.5% (78,380 members), and the Pentecostal churches at 6.5% (33,195 members), with other Protestant denominations in much smaller numbers. Non-Christians constituted only 6.8% of the population, with the majority of those respondents indicating &quot;no religious affiliation&quot; (6.2% of the population).

==Economy==

For many years, Newfoundland and Labrador experienced a depressed economy. Following the collapse of the cod fishery during the early 1990s, the province suffered record unemployment rates and the population decreased by roughly 60,000. Due to a major energy and resources boom, the provincial economy has had a major turnaround since the turn of the 21st century. Unemployment rates decreased, the population stabilized and had moderate growth. The province has gained record surpluses, which has rid it of its status as a &quot;have not&quot; province.

Economic growth, gross domestic product (GDP), exports, and employment resumed in 2010, after suffering the effects of the late-2000s recession. In 2010, total capital investment in the province grew to C$6.2 billion, an increase of 23.0% compared to 2009. 2010 GDP reached $28.1 billion, compared to $25.0 billion in 2009.

===Primary sector===
Oil production from offshore oil platforms on the Hibernia, White Rose and Terra Nova oil fields on the Grand Banks was of , which contributed to more than 15 per cent of the province&#x27;s GDP in 2006. Total production from the Hibernia field from 1997 to 2006 was with an estimated value of $36 billion. This will increase with the inclusion of the latest project, Hebron. Remaining reserves are estimated at almost as of December 31, 2006. Exploration for new reserves is ongoing. On June 16, 2009, provincial premier Danny Williams announced a tentative agreement to expand the Hibernia oil field. The government negotiated a 10 per cent equity stake in the Hibernia South expansion, which will add an estimated $10 billion to Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s treasury.
The mining sector in Labrador is still growing. The iron ore mine at Wabush/Labrador City, and the nickel mine in Voisey&#x27;s Bay produced a total of $3.3 billion worth of ore in 2010. A mine at Duck Pond ( south of the now-closed mine at Buchans), started producing copper, zinc, silver and gold in 2007, and prospecting for new ore bodies continues. Mining accounted for 3.5% of the provincial GDP in 2006. The province produces 55% of Canada&#x27;s total iron ore. Quarries producing dimension stone such as slate and granite, account for less than $10 million worth of material per year.

The fishing industry remains an important part of the provincial economy, employing roughly 20,000 and contributing over $440 million to the GDP. The combined harvest of fish such as cod, haddock, halibut, herring and mackerel was 92,961 tonnes in 2017, with a combined value of $141 million. Shellfish, such as crab, shrimp and clams, accounted for 101,922 tonnes in the same year, yielding $634 million. The value of products from the seal hunt was $1.9 million. In 2015, aquaculture produced over 22,000 tonnes of Atlantic salmon, mussels and steelhead trout worth over $161 million. Oyster production is also forthcoming.

Agriculture in Newfoundland is limited to areas south of St. John&#x27;s, Cormack, Wooddale, areas near Musgravetown and in the Codroy Valley. Potatoes, rutabagas, turnips, carrots and cabbage are grown for local consumption. Poultry, eggs, and dairy are also produced. Wild blueberries, partridgeberries (lingonberries) and bakeapples (cloudberries) are harvested commercially and used in jams and wine making.

===Secondary sector===
Newsprint is produced by one paper mill in Corner Brook with a capacity of per year. The value of newsprint exports varies greatly from year to year, depending on the global market price. Lumber is produced by numerous mills in Newfoundland. Apart from seafood processing, paper manufacture and oil refining, manufacturing in the province consists of smaller industries producing food, brewing and other beverage production.

===Tertiary sector===
Service industries accounted for the largest share of GDP, especially financial services, health care and public administration. Other significant industries are mining, oil production and manufacturing. The total labour force in 2018 was 261,400 people. Per capita GDP in 2017 was $62,573, higher than the national average and third only to Alberta and Saskatchewan out of Canadian provinces.

Tourism is also a significant contributor to the province&#x27;s economy. In 2006, nearly 500,000 non-resident tourists visited Newfoundland and Labrador, spending an estimated $366 million. In 2017, non-resident tourists spent an estimated $575 million. Tourism is most popular throughout the months of June–September, the warmest months of the year with the longest hours of daylight.

==Government and politics==
Newfoundland and Labrador is governed by a parliamentary government within the construct of constitutional monarchy; the monarchy in Newfoundland and Labrador is the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The sovereign is King Charles III, who also serves as head of state of 14 other Commonwealth countries, each of Canada&#x27;s nine other provinces and the Canadian federal realm; he resides in the United Kingdom. The King&#x27;s representative in Newfoundland and Labrador is the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador, presently Joan Marie Aylward.

The direct participation of the royal and viceroyal figures in governance is limited; in practice, their use of the executive powers is directed by the Executive Council, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the unicameral, elected House of Assembly. The Council is chosen and headed by the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, the head of government. After each general election, the lieutenant governor will usually appoint as premier the leader of the political party that has a majority or plurality in the House of Assembly. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.

Each of the 40 Members of the House of Assembly (MHA) is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district. General elections must be called by the lieutenant governor on the second Tuesday in October four years after the previous election, or may be called earlier, on the advice of the premier, should the government lose a confidence vote in the legislature. Traditionally, politics in the province have been dominated by both the Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservative Party. However, in the 2011 provincial election the New Democratic Party, which had only ever attained minor success, had a major breakthrough and placed second in the popular vote behind the Progressive Conservatives.

==Culture==

===Art===

Before 1950, the visual arts were a minor aspect of Newfoundland cultural life, compared with the performing arts such as music or theatre. Until about 1900, most art was the work of visiting artists, who included members of the Group of Seven, Rockwell Kent and Eliot O&#x27;Hara. Artists such as Newfoundland-born Maurice Cullen and Robert Pilot travelled to Europe to study art in prominent ateliers.

By the turn of the 20th century, amateur art was made by people living and working in the province. These artists included J.W. Hayward and his son Thomas B. Hayward, Agnes Marian Ayre, and Harold B. Goodridge, the last of whom worked on a number of mural commissions, notably one for the lobby of the Confederation Building in St. John&#x27;s. Local art societies became prominent in the 1940s, particularly The Art Students Club, which opened in 1940.

After Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949, government grants fostered a supportive environment for visual artists, primarily painters. The visual arts of the province developed significantly in the second half of the century, with the return of young Newfoundland artists whom had studied abroad. Amongst the first were Rae Perlin, who studied at the Art Students League in New York, and Helen Parsons Shepherd and her husband Reginald Shepherd, who both graduated from the Ontario College of Art. The Shepherds established the province&#x27;s first art school, the Newfoundland Academy of Art.

Newfoundland-born painters Christopher Pratt and Mary Pratt returned to the province in 1961 to work at the newly established Memorial University Art Gallery as its first curator, later transitioning to painting full-time in Salmonier. David Blackwood graduated from the Ontario College of Art in the early 1960s and achieved acclaim with his images of Newfoundland culture and history. Newfoundland-born artist Gerald Squires returned in 1969.

The creation of The Memorial University Extension Services and St. Michael&#x27;s Printshop in the 1960s and 1970s attracted a number of visual artists to the province to teach and create art. Similarly, the school in Hibb&#x27;s Hole (now Hibb&#x27;s Cove), established by painter George Noseworthy, brought professional artists such as Anne Meredith Barry to the province. A notable artist during this period is Marlene Creates.

From 1980 to present, opportunities for artists continued to develop, as galleries such as the Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador (which later became The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery), the Resource Centre for the Arts, and Eastern Edge were established. Fine arts education programs were established at post-secondary institutions such as Sir Wilfred Grenfell College in Corner Brook, the Western Community College (now College of the North Atlantic) in Stephenville, and the Anna Templeton Centre in St. John&#x27;s.

Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s arts community is recognized nationally and internationally. The creation of Fogo Island Arts in 2008 on Fogo Island created a residency-based contemporary art program for artists, filmmakers, writers, musicians, curators, designers, and thinkers. In 2013 and 2015, the province was represented at the Venice Biennale as Official Collateral Projects. In 2015, Philippa Jones became the first Newfoundland and Labrador artist to be included in the National Gallery of Canada contemporary art biennial. Other notable contemporary artists who have received national and international attention include Will Gill, Kym Greeley, Ned Pratt and Peter Wilkins.

As of 2011, a study documented approximately 1,200 artists, representing 0.47% of the province&#x27;s labour force.

===Music===

Newfoundland and Labrador has a folk musical heritage based on the Irish, English and Scottish traditions that were brought to its shores centuries ago. Though similar in its Celtic influence to neighbouring Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador are more Irish than Scottish, and have more elements imported from English and French music than those provinces. Much of the region&#x27;s music focuses on the strong seafaring tradition in the area, and includes sea shanties and other sailing songs. Some modern traditional musicians include Great Big Sea, The Ennis Sisters, The Dardanelles, Ron Hynes and Jim Payne.

The Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra began in St. John&#x27;s in 1962 as a 20-piece string orchestra known as the St. John&#x27;s Orchestra. A school of music at Memorial University schedules a variety of concerts and has a chamber orchestra and jazz band. Two members of its faculty, Nancy Dahn on violin and Timothy Steeves on piano, perform as Duo Concertante and are responsible for establishing an annual music festival in August, the Tuckamore Festival. Both the school of music and Opera on the Avalon produce operatic works. A leading institution for research in ethnomusicology, Memorial&#x27;s Research Centre for the Study of Music, Media, and Place, offers academic lectures, scholarly residencies, conferences, symposia, and outreach activities to the province on music and culture.

The pre-confederation and current provincial anthem is the &quot;Ode to Newfoundland&quot;, written by British colonial governor Sir Charles Cavendish Boyle in 1902. It was adopted as the official Newfoundland anthem on May 20, 1904. In 1980, the province re-adopted the song as an official provincial anthem. &quot;The Ode to Newfoundland&quot; is still sung at public events in Newfoundland and Labrador.

===Literature===

Margaret Duley (1894–1968) was Newfoundland&#x27;s first novelist to gain an international audience. Her works include &quot;The Eyes of the Gull&quot; (1936), &quot;Cold Pastoral&quot; (1939) and &quot;Highway to Valour&quot; (1941). Subsequent novelists include Harold Horwood, author of &quot;Tomorrow Will Be Sunday&quot; (1966) and &quot;White Eskimo&quot; (1972), and Percy Janes, author of &quot;House of Hate&quot; (1970). Michael Crummey&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;River Thieves&quot; (2001), became a Canadian bestseller. Wayne Johnston&#x27;s fiction deals primarily with the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, often in a historical setting; His novels include &quot;The Story of Bobby O&#x27;Malley&quot;, &quot;The Time of Their Lives&quot;, &quot;The Divine Ryans&quot;, and &quot;The Colony of Unrequited Dreams&quot;, a historical portrayal of Newfoundland politician Joey Smallwood. Lisa Moore&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Alligator&quot; (2005), is set in St. John&#x27;s and incorporates her Newfoundland heritage. Other contemporary novelists include Joel Thomas Hynes, author of &quot;We&#x27;ll All Be Burnt in Our Beds Some Night&quot; (2017), Jessica Grant, author of &quot;Come Thou Tortoise&quot; (2009), and Kenneth J. Harvey, author of &quot;The Town That Forgot How to Breathe&quot; (2003), &quot;Inside&quot; (2006) and &quot;Blackstrap Hawco&quot; (2008).
The earliest works of poetry in British North America, mainly written by visitors and targeted at a European audience, described the new territories in optimistic terms. One of the first works was Robert Hayman&#x27;s &quot;Quodlibets&quot;, a collection of verses composed in Newfoundland and published in 1628.

In the oral tradition of County Waterford, the Munster Irish poet Donnchadh Ruadh Mac Conmara, a former hedge school teacher, is said to have sailed for Newfoundland around 1743, allegedly to escape the wrath of a man whose daughter the poet had impregnated. During the 21st century, however, linguists discovered that several of Donnchadh Ruadh&#x27;s poems in the Irish language contain multiple Gaelicized words and terms known to be unique to Newfoundland English. For this reason, Donnchadh Ruadh&#x27;s poems are considered the earliest literature in the Irish language in Newfoundland.

After the Second World War, Newfoundland poet E. J. Pratt described the struggle to make a living from the sea in poems about maritime life and the history of Canada, including in his 1923 &quot;breakthrough collection&quot; &quot;Newfoundland Verse&quot;. Amongst more recent poets are Tom Dawe, Al Pittman, Mary Dalton, Agnes Walsh, Patrick Warner and John Steffler. Canadian poet Don McKay has resided in St. John&#x27;s in recent years.

In 1967 the St. John&#x27;s Arts and Culture Centre was opened along with the first all-Canadian Dominion Drama Festival: 
::Playwrights across Canada began writing, and this explosion was also felt in Newfoundland and Labrador. Subregional festivals saw Newfoundland plays compete—&quot;Wreakers&quot; by Cassie Brown, &quot;Tomorrow Will Be Sunday&quot; by Tom Cahill, and &quot;Holdin&#x27; Ground&quot; by Ted Russell. Cahill&#x27;s play went on to receive top honours and a performance at Expo 67 in Montreal. Joining Brown and Cahill in the seventies were Michael Cook and Al Pittman, both prolific writers.

===Performing arts===
Rossleys, a &quot;vaudeville-style performance troupe&quot;, put on blackface minstrelsy shows which were a popular source of entertainment in Newfoundland between 1911 and 1917. Modern theatre companies include the New Curtain Theatre Company in Clarenville and the New World Theatre Project in Cupids. Shakespeare by the Sea presents outdoor productions of the plays of William Shakespeare, as well as pieces related to the province and culture.

Dance in Newfoundland and Labrador comprises dances that are specific to the province, including performance and traditional, and Indigenous dance. The Kittiwake Dance Theatre, founded in 1987, is the oldest non-profit dance company in Newfoundland.

===Symbols===


Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s present provincial flag, designed by Newfoundland artist Christopher Pratt, was officially adopted by the legislature on May 28, 1980, and first flown on &quot;Discovery Day&quot; that year. The blue is meant to represent the sea, the white represents snow and ice, the red represents the efforts and struggles of the people, and the gold represents the confidence of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. The blue triangles are a tribute to the Union Flag, and represent the British heritage of the province. The two red triangles represent Labrador (the mainland portion of the province) and the island. In Pratt&#x27;s words, the golden arrow points towards a &quot;brighter future&quot;.

What has commonly but mistakenly been called the Newfoundland tricolour &quot;Pink, White and Green&quot;(sic) is the flag of the Catholic Church affiliated Star of the Sea Association (SOSA). It originated in the late nineteenth century and enjoyed popularity among people who were under the impression that it was the Native Flag of Newfoundland which was created before 1852 by the Newfoundland Natives&#x27; Society. The true Native Flag (red-white-green tricolour) was widely flown into the late nineteenth century. Neither tricolour was ever adopted by the Newfoundland government. The &quot;Pink, White and Green&quot;(sic) has been adopted by some residents as a symbol of ties with Irish heritage and as a political statement. Many of the province&#x27;s Protestants, who make up nearly 60% of the province&#x27;s total population, may not identify with this heritage. At the same time, many of the province&#x27;s Catholics, approximately 37% of the total population (with at least 22% of the population claiming Irish ancestry), think the current provincial flag does not satisfactorily represent them. But, a government-sponsored poll in 2005 revealed that 75% of Newfoundlanders rejected adoption of the Tricolour flag as the province&#x27;s official flag.

Labrador has its own unofficial flag, created in 1973 by Mike Martin, former Member of the Legislative Assembly for Labrador South.

On Newfoundland, moose have become an increasingly adopted symbol of the island.

==Sports==

Newfoundland and Labrador has a somewhat different sports culture from the rest of Canada, owing in part to its long history separate from the rest of Canada and under British rule. Ice hockey, however, remains popular; though operations ceased in April 2024, a minor league professional team called the Newfoundland Growlers of the ECHL played at Mary Brown&#x27;s Centre (formerly Mile One Centre) in St. John&#x27;s from the 2018–19 to 2023–24 seasons. The area had an intermittent American Hockey League presence with the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs then St. John&#x27;s IceCaps until 2017, and the Newfoundland Senior Hockey League had teams around the island. After the departure of the St. John&#x27;s Fog Devils in 2008, Newfoundland and Labrador has been the only province in Canada to not have a team in the major junior Canadian Hockey League. However, this is set to change in 2025, with the Acadie–Bathurst Titan scheduled to relocate to St. John’s to become Newfoundland Regiment in the QMJHL.

Hurling and other Gaelic games have a very long history in the Province and continue to be played.

Association football (soccer) and rugby union are both more popular in Newfoundland and Labrador than the rest of Canada in general. Soccer is hosted at King George V Park, a 6,000-seat stadium built as Newfoundland&#x27;s national stadium during the time as an independent dominion. Swilers Rugby Park is home of the Swilers RFC rugby union club, as well as the Atlantic Rock, one of the four regional teams in the Canadian Rugby Championship. Other sports facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador include Pepsi Centre, an indoor arena in Corner Brook; and St. Patrick&#x27;s Park, a baseball park in St. John&#x27;s.

Gridiron football, be it either American or Canadian, is almost non-existent; it is the only Canadian province other than Prince Edward Island to have never hosted a Canadian Football League or Canadian Interuniversity Sport game, and it was not until 2013 the province saw its first amateur teams form.

Cricket was once a popular sport. The earliest mention is in the &quot;Newfoundland Mercantile Journal&quot;, Thursday September 16, 1824, indicating the St. John&#x27;s Cricket Club was an established club at this time. The St. John&#x27;s Cricket club was one of the first cricket clubs in North America. Other centres were at Harbour Grace, Twillingate and Trinity. The heyday of the game was the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, at which time there was league in St. John&#x27;s, as well as an interschool tournament. John Shannon Munn is Newfoundland&#x27;s most famous cricketer, having represented Oxford University. After the first World War, cricket declined in popularity and was replaced by soccer and baseball. However, with the arrival of immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, cricket is once again gaining interest in the province.

In 2024 Newfoundland and Labrador became the shirt sponsors of Barrow A.F.C., an association football (soccer) team located in North West England.

==Transportation==

===Ferries===
Within the province, the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Transportation and Works operates or sponsors 15 automobile, passenger and freight ferry routes which connect various communities along the province&#x27;s significant coastline.

A regular passenger and car ferry service, lasting about 90 minutes, crosses the Strait of Belle Isle, connecting the province&#x27;s island of Newfoundland with the region of Labrador on the mainland. The ferry MV Qajaq W travels from St. Barbe, Newfoundland, on the Great Northern Peninsula, to the port town of Blanc-Sablon, Quebec, located on the provincial border and beside the town of L&#x27;Anse-au-Clair, Labrador. The MV &quot;Sir Robert Bond&quot; once provided seasonal ferry service between Lewisporte on the island and the towns of Cartwright and Happy Valley-Goose Bay in Labrador, but has not run since the completion of the Trans-Labrador Highway in 2010, allowing access from Blanc-Sablon, Quebec, to major parts of Labrador. Several smaller ferries connect numerous other coastal towns and offshore island communities around the island of Newfoundland and up the Labrador coast as far north as Nain. There are also two ferries, MV Legionnaire and MV Flanders, that operate between Bell Island and Portugal Cove–St. Philips yearly, mainly used by those commuting to St. John&#x27;s for work. The MV Veteran, a sister ship of MV Legionnaire, operates between Fogo Island, Change Islands, and Farewell.

Inter-provincial ferry services are provided by Marine Atlantic, a federal Crown corporation which operates auto-passenger ferries from North Sydney, Nova Scotia, to the towns of Port aux Basques and Argentia on the southern coast of Newfoundland island.

===Aviation===
The St. John&#x27;s International Airport (YYT) and the Gander International Airport (YQX) are the only airports in the province that are part of the National Airports System. The St. John&#x27;s International Airport handles nearly 1.2 million passengers a year making it the busiest airport in the province and the fourteenth busiest airport in Canada. YYT airport underwent a major expansion of the terminal building which was completed in 2021. The Deer Lake Airport (YDF) handles over 300,000 passengers a year.

===Railway===
The Newfoundland Railway operated on the island of Newfoundland from 1898 to 1988. With a total track length of , it was the longest narrow-gauge railway system in North America. The railway ended on June 20, 1988, in the rails for roads deal.

Tshiuetin Rail Transportation operates passenger rail service on its Sept-Îles, Quebec, to Schefferville, Quebec route, passing through Labrador and stopping in several towns.

<text>The New Oxford American Dictionary (NOAD) is a single-volume dictionary of American English compiled by American editors at the Oxford University Press.

&quot;NOAD&quot; is based upon the &quot;New Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; (&quot;NODE&quot;), published in the United Kingdom in 1998, although with substantial editing, additional entries, and the inclusion of illustrations. It is based on a corpus linguistics analysis of Oxford&#x27;s 200 million word database of contemporary American English.

&quot;NOAD&quot; includes a diacritical respelling scheme to convey pronunciations, as opposed to the Gimson phonemic IPA system that is used in &quot;NODE&quot;.

==Editions==

===First edition===
Published in September 2001, the first edition was edited by Elizabeth J. Jewell and Frank Abate.

===Second edition===
Published in May 2005, the second edition was edited by Erin McKean. The edition added nearly 3,000 new words, senses, and phrases. It was in a large format, with 2096 pages, and was 8½&quot; by 11&quot; in size. It included a CD-ROM with the full text of the dictionary for Palm OS devices.

Since 2005 Apple Inc.&#x27;s Mac OS X operating system has come bundled with a dictionary application and widget which credits as its source &quot;Oxford American Dictionaries&quot;, and contains the full text of &quot;NOAD2&quot;. The Amazon Kindle reading device also uses &quot;NOAD&quot; as its built-in dictionary, along with a choice for the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot;.

Oxford University Press published &quot;NOAD2&quot; in electronic form in 2006 at the OxfordAmericanDictionary.com, and in 2010, along with the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot;, as part of Oxford Dictionaries Online.

===Third edition===
Published in August 2010, the third edition was edited by Angus Stevenson and Christine A. Lindberg. This edition includes over 2,000 new words, senses, and phrases, and over 1,000(1225) illustrations; hundreds of new and revised explanatory notes, new &quot;Word Trends&quot; feature charts usage for rapidly changing words and phrases.

==Fictitious entry==
The dictionary includes an entry for the word &quot;esquivalience&quot;, which it defines as meaning &quot;the willful avoidance of one&#x27;s official responsibilities&quot;. This is a fictitious entry, intended to protect the copyright of the publication. The entry was invented by Christine Lindberg, one of the editors of the &quot;NOAD&quot;.

With the publication of the second edition, a rumor circulated that the dictionary contained a fictitious entry in the letter &#x27;e&#x27;. &quot;New Yorker&quot; contributing editor Henry Alford combed the section, and discussed several unusual entries he found with a group of American lexicographers. Most found &quot;esquivalience&quot; to be the most likely candidate, and when Alford approached &quot;NOAD&quot; editor in chief Erin McKean she confirmed it was a fake entry, which had been present since the first edition, in order to protect the copyright of the CD-ROM edition. Of the word, she said &quot;its inherent fakeitude is fairly obvious&quot;.

The fake entry apparently ensnared Dictionary.com, which included an entry for it (that has since been removed) which it attributed to &quot;Webster&#x27;s New Millennium Dictionary&quot;, both of which are owned by the private company Lexico. Possibly due to its licensing of Oxford dictionaries, Google Dictionary included the word, listing three meanings and giving usage examples.

<doc id="21983" wikidata="Q1248221" url="?curid=21983" title="Neo-Latin">
<text>Neo-Latin (sometimes called New Latin or Modern Latin) is the style of written Latin used in original literary, scholarly, and scientific works, first in Italy during the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and then across northern Europe after about 1500, as a key feature of the humanist movement. Through comparison with Latin of the Classical period, scholars from Petrarch onwards promoted a standard of Latin closer to that of the ancient Romans, especially in grammar, style, and spelling. The term &quot;Neo-Latin&quot; was however coined much later, probably in Germany in the late eighteenth century, as &quot;Neulatein&quot;, spreading to French and other languages in the nineteenth century. Medieval Latin had diverged quite substantially from the classical standard and saw notable regional variation and influence from vernacular languages. Neo-Latin attempts to return to the ideal of Golden Latinity in line with the Humanist slogan .

The new style of Latin was adopted throughout Europe, first through the spread of urban education in Italy, and then the rise of the printing press and of early modern schooling. Latin was learnt as a spoken language as well as written, as the vehicle of schooling and University education, while vernacular languages were still infrequently used in such settings. As such, Latin dominated early publishing, and made up a significant portion of printed works until the early nineteenth century.

In Neo-Latin&#x27;s most productive phase, it dominated science, philosophy, law, and theology, and it was important for history, literature, plays, and poetry. Classical styles of writing, including approaches to rhetoric, poetical metres, and theatrical structures, were revived and applied to contemporary subject matter. It was a pan-European language for the dissemination of knowledge and communication between people with different vernaculars in the Republic of Letters . Even as Latin receded in importance after 1650, it remained vital for international communication of works, many of which were popularised in Latin translation, rather than as vernacular originals. This in large part explains the continued use of Latin in Scandinavian countries and Russia – places that had never belonged to the Roman Empire – to disseminate knowledge until the early nineteenth century.

Neo-Latin includes extensive new word formation. Modern scholarly and technical nomenclature, such as in zoological and botanical taxonomy and international scientific vocabulary, draws extensively from this newly minted vocabulary, often in the form of classical or neoclassical compounds. Large parts of this new Latin vocabulary have seeped into English, French and several Germanic languages, particularly through Neo-Latin.

In the eighteenth century, Latin was increasingly being learnt as a written and read language, with less emphasis on oral fluency. While it still dominated education, its position alongside Greek was increasingly attacked and began to erode. In the nineteenth century, education in Latin (and Greek) focused increasingly on reading and grammar, and mutated into the &#x27;classics&#x27; as a topic, although it often still dominated the school curriculum, especially for students aiming for entry to university. Learning moved gradually away from poetry composition and other written skills; as a language, its use was increasingly passive outside of classical commentaries and other specialised texts.

Latin remained in active use in eastern Europe and Scandinavia for a longer period. In Poland, it was used as a vehicle of local government. This extended to those parts of Poland absorbed by Germany. Latin was used as a common tongue between parts of the Austrian Empire, particularly Hungary and Croatia, at least until the 1820s. Croatia maintained a Latin poetry tradition through the nineteenth century. Latin also remained the language of the Catholic Church and of oral debate at a high level in international conferences until the mid twentieth century.

Over time, and especially in its later phases after its practical value had severely declined, education that included strong emphasis on Latin and Greek became associated with elitism and as a deliberate class barrier for entry to educational institutions.

Post-classical Latin, including medieval, Renaissance and Neo-Latin, makes up the vast majority of extant Latin output, estimated as well over 99.99% of the totality. Given the size of output and importance of Latin, the lack of attention to it is surprising to many scholars. The trend is a long one, however, dating back to the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as Neo-Latin texts became looked down on as non-classical. Reasons could include the rising belief during this period in the superiority of vernacular literatures, and the idea that only writing in one&#x27;s first language could produce genuinely creative output, found in nationalism and Romanticism. More recently, the lack of trained Latinists has added to the barriers.

More academic attention has been given to Neo-Latin studies since 1970, and the role and influence of Latin output in this period has begun to be reassessed. Rather than being an adjunct to Classical Latin forms, or an isolated, derivative and now largely irrelevant cultural output, Neo-Latin literature is seen as a vital context for understanding the vernacular cultures in the periods when Latin was in widespread productive use. Additionally, Classical reception studies have begun to assess the differing ways that Classical culture was understood in different nations and times.

==Extent and characteristics==
===Time period===
Classicists use the term &quot;Neo-Latin&quot; to describe the Latin that developed in Renaissance Italy as a result of renewed interest in classical civilization in the 14th and 15th centuries. Scientific nomenclatures sometimes prefer the term &quot;New Latin&quot;, to show where their terms were coined in the same period.

Neo-Latin describes the use of the Latin language for any purpose, scientific or literary, during and after the Renaissance. The beginning of the period cannot be precisely identified. The spread of secular education, the acceptance of humanistic literary norms, and the wide availability of Latin texts following the invention of printing, mark the transition to a new era of scholarship at the end of the 15th century, but there was no simple, decisive break with medieval traditions. Rather, there was a process of change in education, a choice of literary and stylistic models, and a move away from medieval techniques of language formation and argumentation.

The end of the Neo-Latin period is likewise indeterminate, but Latin as a regular vehicle of communicating ideas became rare following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and after the Congress of Vienna, where French replaced Latin as the language of diplomacy. By 1900, Latin survived primarily in international scientific vocabulary and taxonomy, or more actively, in the upper echelons of the Catholic Church. The term &quot;Neo-Latin&quot; came into use during the 1800s among linguists and scientists.

Neo-Latin can be said to be the current style of Latin writing, but different periods in its evolution can be seen. Neo-Latin writings were seen as less relevant and deserving of less attention than Classical Latin during the 1800s, as Classical models were asserted as the prime focus for study. Productive use of Latin for most purposes ended in the early 1800s.

=== Character of Neo-Latin writing ===
While Latin remained an actively used language, the process of emulating Classical models did not become complete. For instance, Catholic traditions preserved some features of medieval Latin, given the continued influence of some aspects of medieval theology. In secular texts, such as scientific, legal and philosophical works, neologisms continued to be needed, so while Neo-Latin authors might choose new formulations, they might also continue to use customary medieval forms, but in either case, could not aim for a purified Classical Latin vocabulary. Recent study tends to identify a style of Latin that was closer to Classical Latin in grammar, sometimes influenced by vernaculars in syntax especially in more everyday writing, but eclectic in choice of vocabulary and generation of new words.

Some authors including C. S. Lewis have criticised the Neo-Latin and classicising nature of humanistic Latin teaching for creating a dynamic for purification and ossification of Latin, and thus its decline from a more productive medieval background. Modern Neo-Latin scholars tend to reject this, as for instance word formation and even medieval uses continued; but some see a kernel of truth, in that the standards of Latin were set very high, making it hard to achieve the necessary confidence to use Latin. In any case, other factors are certainly at play, particularly the widening of education and its needs to address many more practical areas of knowledge, many of which were being written about for national audiences in the vernacular.

===Corpus===
The exact size of the Neo-Latin corpus is currently incalculable, but dwarfs that of Latin in all other periods combined. Material includes personal, unpublished, bureaucratic, educational, and academic output such as notes and theses. Given the extent of potential records, even regarding printed works, there is extensive basic work to be done in cataloguing what is available, as well as in digitisation and translation of important works.

===Geographical spread===
Neo-Latin was, at least in its early days, an international language used throughout Catholic and Protestant Europe, as well as in the colonies of the major European powers. This area consisted of most of Europe, including Central Europe and Scandinavia; its southern border was the Mediterranean Sea, with the division more or less corresponding to the modern eastern borders of Finland, the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia.

Russia&#x27;s acquisition of Kyiv in the later 17th century introduced the study of Latin to Russia. Russia relied on Latin for some time as a vehicle to exchange scientific knowledge. Nevertheless, the use of Latin in Orthodox eastern Europe did not reach pervasive levels due to their strong cultural links to the cultural heritage of Ancient Greece and Byzantium, as well as Greek and Old Church Slavonic languages.

Latin was taught extensively in the USA, during the colonial period on the European model of Latin medium education, but was among the first to allow this monopoly to recede. Both Latin and the Classics were very influential nevertheless, and supported an active Latin literature, especially in poetry.

Latin played a strong role in education and writing in early colonial Mexico, Brazil and in other parts of Catholic Americas. Catholicism also brought Latin to India, China and Japan.

==History==

===Beginnings===
 Neo-Latin began in Italy with the rise of Renaissance Latin and humanist reform of Latin education, then brought to prominence in northern Europe by writers such as Erasmus, More, and Colet.

Medieval Latin had been the practical working language of the Roman Catholic Church, and was taught throughout Europe to clerics through the medieval university system. It was a flexible language, with many neologisms. Changes in grammatical practices regarding syntax and other elements such as conjunctions had become established.

The Renaissance reinforced the position of Latin as a spoken and written language by the scholarship by the Renaissance Humanists. Although scholarship initially focused on Ancient Greek texts, Petrarch and others began to change their understanding of good style and their own usage of Latin as they explored the texts of the Classical Latin world. Skills of textual criticism evolved to create much more accurate versions of extant texts through the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and some important texts were rediscovered. Comprehensive versions of author&#x27;s works were published by Isaac Casaubon, Joseph Scaliger and others. Nevertheless, despite the careful work of Petrarch, Politian and others, first the demand for manuscripts, and then the rush to bring works into print, led to the circulation of inaccurate copies for several centuries following.

As the humanist reformers sought both to purify Latin grammar and style, and to make Latin applicable to concerns beyond the ecclesiastical, they began to create a body of Latin literature outside the bounds of the Church. Nevertheless, studies and criticism of Biblical translations were a particular and important focus of early Humanism, in Italy and beyond.

Prominent Neo-Latin writers who were admired for their style in this early period included Pontano, Petrarch, Salutati, Bruni, Ficino, Pico della Mirandola in Italy; the Spaniard Juan Luis Vives; and in northern Europe, the German Celtis.

In the late 1400s, some schools in the Low Countries were using the new Italian standards of Latin. Erasmus and other pupils promoted the new learning and Latin standards. The Low Countries established itself as a leading centre of humanism and Neo-Latin; Rotterdam and Leuven were especially well known for these intellectual currents.

Neo-Latin developed in advance of and in parallel with vernacular languages, but not necessarily in direct competition with them. Frequently the same people were codifying and promoting both Latin and vernacular languages, in a wider post-medieval process of linguistic standardisation. However, Latin was the first language that was available, fully formed, widely taught and used internationally across a wide variety of subjects. As such, it can be seen as the first &quot;modern European language&quot;.

It should also be noted that for Italian reformers of written Latin, there was no clear divide between Italian and Latin; the latter was seen by Petrarch for example as an artificial and literary version of the spoken language. While Italian in this period also begins to be used as a separate written language, it was not always seen as wholly separate from Latin.

===Height: 1500–1700===
The Protestant Reformation (1520–1580), though it removed Latin from the liturgies of the churches of Northern Europe, promoted the reform of the new secular Latin teaching.

The heyday of Neo-Latin was 1500–1700, when in the continuation of the Medieval Latin tradition, it served as the lingua franca of science, medicine, legal discourse, theology, education, and to some degree diplomacy in Europe. This coincided with the growth of printed literature; Latin dominated early publishing. Classic works such as Thomas More&#x27;s were published. Other prominent writers of this period include Dutchmen Grotius and Secundus and Scotsman George Buchanan. Women, while rarely published, also wrote and composed poetry in Latin, Elizabeth Jane Weston being the most well known example.

====Latin in school education 1500–1700====
Throughout this period, Latin was a universal school subject, and indeed, the pre-eminent subject for elementary education in most of Europe and other places of the world that shared its culture. Schools were variously known as grammar schools in Britain, Latin schools in France, Germany, the Netherlands and colonial North America, and also Gymnasia in Germany and many other countries.

Latin was frequently the normal medium of education, both for teaching the Latin language, and for other subjects. Fluency in spoken Latin was an objective as well as the ability to read and write; evidence of this includes the emphasis on use of diacritics to maintain understanding of vowel quantity, which is important orally, and also on the use of for children&#x27;s learning, which would help to equip the learner with spoken vocabulary for common topics, such as play and games, home work and describing travel. In short, Latin was taught as a &quot;completely normal language&quot;, to be used as any other. Colloquia would also contain moral education. At a higher level, Erasmus&#x27; Colloquia helped equip Latin speakers with urbane and polite phraseology, and means of discussing more philosophical topics.

 Changes to Latin teaching varied by region. In Italy, with more urbanised schools and Universities, and wider curricula aimed at professions rather than just theology, Latin teaching evolved more gradually, and earlier, in order to speed up the learning of Latin. For instance, initial learning of grammar in a basic Latin word order followed the practice of medieval schools. In both medieval and Renaissance schools, practice in Latin written skills would then extend to prose style composition, as part of &#x27;rhetoric&#x27;. In Italy, for prose for instance, a pupil would typically be asked to convert a passage in to , that is from a natural to stylised word order. Unlike medieval schools, however, Italian Renaissance methods focused on Classical models of Latin prose style, reviving texts from that period, such as Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Inventione&quot; or Quintilian&#x27;s .

Teaching of specific, gradually harder Latin authors and texts followed rhetorical practice and learning. In Italy, during the medieval period, at different periods, Classical and Christian authors competed for attention, but the Renaissance and Neo-Latin period saw a decisive move back to authors from the Classical period, and away from non-Classical &#x27;minor&#x27; authors such as Boethius, whose language was simpler.

 The changes to schooling in Northern Europe were more profound, as methods had not evolved as quickly. Adopting Italian innovations, changes to the teaching of grammar and rhetoric were promoted by reformers including Calvin, Melanchthon and Luther. Protestants needed Latin to promote and disseminate their ideas, so were heavily involved with the reform of Latin teaching. Among the most influential of these reformers was Calvin&#x27;s Latin teacher and educational collaborator Corderius, whose bilingual colloquies were aimed at helping French-speaking children learn to speak Latin.

Among Latin schools, the rapid growth of Jesuit schools made them known for their dedication to high attainment in written and spoken Latin to educate future priests. This took place after the Catholic church affirmed their commitment to Latin in the liturgy and as a working language within the hierarchy at the Council of Trent in 1545–63. Jesuit schools were particularly well known for their production of Latin plays, exclusive use of spoken Latin and emphasis on classical written style.

However, the standards ultimately achieved by the whole school system were uneven. Not all students would acquire Latin to a high standard. Even in this period, an excessive focus on grammar and poor teaching methods were seen by reformers as a barrier to the acquisition of Latin. Comenius for instance was credited with significant attempts to make Latin more accessible through use of parallel Latin and native language texts, and more interesting through acquisition of vocabulary and the use of modern and more relevant information in texts. Others worried whether it was appropriate to put so much emphasis on abstract language skills such as Latin poetry composition. As time went on, the difficulties with Latin teaching began to lead to calls to move away from an emphasis on spoken Latin and the introduction of more native-language-medium teaching.

====Latin in university education====
 At the beginning of the Renaissance, universities in northern Europe were still dominated by theology and related topics, while Italian universities were teaching a broader range of courses relating to urban professions such as law and medicine. All universities required Latin proficiency, obtained in local grammar schools, to obtain admittance as a student. Throughout the period, Latin was the dominant language of university education, where rules were enforced against the use of vernacular languages. Lectures and debates took place in Latin, and writing was in Latin, across the curriculum.

Many universities hosted newly or recently-written Latin plays, which formed a significant body of literature before 1650. Plays included satires on student life, such as the play &quot;Studentes&quot; (Students), which went through many reprints.

Enforcement of Latin-only rules tended to decline especially after 1650.

====Latin in academia, law, science and medicine====

Latin dominated topics of international academic and scientific interest, especially at the level of abstract thought addressed to other specialists. To begin with, knowledge was already transmitted through Latin and it maintained specialised vocabularies not found in vernacular languages. This did not preclude scientific writings also existing in vernaculars; for example Galileo, some of whose scientific writings were in Latin, while others were in Italian, the latter less academic and intended to reach a wider audience using the same ideas with more practical applications.

Over time, the use of Latin continued where international communication with specialist audiences was paramount. Later, where some of the discourse moved to French, English or German, translations into Latin would allow texts to cross language boundaries, while authors in countries with much smaller language populations or less known languages would tend to continue to compose in Latin.

Latin was of course the major language of Christian theology. Both Catholic and Protestant writers published in Latin. While Protestant writers would also write in vernaculars, Latin was important for the international dissemination of ideas.

Legal discourse, medicine, philosophy and sciences started from a strong Latin tradition, and continued as such. This began to change in the late seventeenth century, as philosophers and others began to write in their native language first, and translate into Latin for international audiences. Translations would tend to prioritise accuracy over style.

====Latin and religious usage====
 The Catholic Church made exclusive use of Latin in the liturgy, resisting attempts even in the New World and China to diverge from it. As noted above, Jesuit schools fuelled a high standard of Latinity, and this was also supported by the growth of seminaries, as part of the Counter Reformation&#x27;s attempts to revitalise Catholic institutions.

While in Protestant areas Latin was pushed out of the Church, this did not make Protestants hostile to Latin in education or universities. In fact, Latin remained a kind of bridge of communication across religious as well as linguistic divides in the .

One exception to the general rule of vernacular services in Protestant countries can be observed in the Anglican Church, where with the publication of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of 1559, a Latin edition was published in 1560 for use in universities such as Oxford and the leading grammar and &quot;public schools&quot; (in the period, English schools established with charitable structures open to the general public; now a kind of private academy), where the liturgy was still permitted to be conducted in Latin.

====Latin as a literary vehicle====
In this period, it was common for poets and authors to write in Latin, either in place of or in addition to their native language. Latin was a language for &quot;high art&quot; in an &quot;eternal language&quot;, that authors supposed might outlast contemporary vernacular writings. It allowed for an international readership that shared the same Classical and recent Latin cultural reference points.

The literature did not stand apart from vernaculars, as naturally allusions and the same reference points could flow across language boundaries. However, these dynamics have become less well understood, as academics and other readers are not as familiar with the Latin works of the period, sometimes resulting in simplistic notions of competition and replacement of Latin over time. The actual processes were more complicated and are now a focus of Neo-Latin studies. For instance, stylistic borrowings flowed from Latin to the Dutch vernacular, where models were lacking in the latter.

Outputs included novels, poems, plays and occasional pieces, stretching across genres analogous to those found in vernacular writings of the period, such as tragedy, comedy, satire, history and political advice. Epistolary (letter) writing containing poems and prose, designed for publication rather than purely receipt, had Classical antecedents and often contained strong elements of self-promotion.

Some of these genres are harder for modern readers to evaluate; for instance many poems were written for specific occasions, such as appointments or institutional events. To modern audiences, such poetry appears contrived at its inception, so it is easy for the reader to assume a lack of pathos or skill.

At the time that many of these works were written, writers viewed their Latin output as perhaps we do high art; a particularly refined and lofty activity, for the most educated audiences. Moreover, there was a hope of greater, international recognition, and that the works written in the &quot;Eternal language&quot; of Latin would outlast writings in the vernacular.

Some very influential works written in Latin are not always commonly remembered, despite their ground-breaking nature. For example, &quot;Argenis&quot;, by John Barclay was perhaps the first modern historical novel, and was popular across Europe.

Opinions vary about the achievements of this literary movement, and also the extent to which it reached its goal of being &quot;classical&quot; in style. Modern critics sometimes claim that the output of Neo-Latinists was largely derivative and imitative of Classical authors. Latin authors themselves could recognise the dangers of imitation caused by the long training they were given in ingesting compositional techniques of Classical writers, and could struggle against it. From another perspective, the &quot;learned artifice&quot; of Neo-Latin writing styles requires that we understand that &quot;one of the most fundamental aspects of this artifice is imitation&quot;. Different approaches to imitation can be discerned, from attempting to adopt the style and manner of a specific author, especially of Cicero, through to syntheses of Latin from good authors, as suggested by Angelo Poliziano, taking elements from a range, to provide what Tunberg calls an &quot;eclectic&quot; style that was &quot;new from the perspective of the whole creation&quot;. The use of Latin exclusively as used by Cicero was heavily satirised by Erasmus who proposed a more flexible approach to Latin as a medium.

Other critics have claimed that the expressive abilities of writers could not truly reach the same heights as in their native language; such concerns were sometimes expressed by contemporaries especially as time went on and vernaculars became more established. On the other hand, this criticism at the very least ignores the early age and intensity with which Latin was acquired.

====Standards of written Latin====
Not all Latin aspired to be high literature, and whether it did or not, standards varied. Standards were most classical and writing more fluid in France and Italy. In England, among typically unpublished scholarly works such as dissertations through the sixteenth century, written Latin improved in morphological accuracy, but sentence construction and idiom often reflected the vernacular. Similar patterns have been found in Sweden, where academic Latin tended to be very accurate in terms of morphology, but less Classical in its sentence patterns. In vocabulary and spelling, usage tend to be quite eclectic, using medieval forms and re-using Classical terms with modern meanings. In any case, it was accepted that technical terms would require neologisms.

There are occasional differences between Classical and Neo-Latin, which can sometimes be assumed to be mistakes of the authors. However, careful analysis of available grammars often shows these differences to be based on the understanding of the grammar rules at the time. For instance, many grammarians believed that &quot;all&quot; names of rivers were masculine, even those ending in &quot;-a&quot;.

Additionally, Neo-Latin authors tended to form new unattested words, such as or , by using Classical rules. Helander says:

Apparently the authors did not care whether these words existed in the preserved Latin literature, as long as they were regularly formed. As a rule, their judgement was very sound, and in most cases we will not as readers realize that we are dealing with neologisms ... A large number of them were probably on the lips of the ancient Romans, although they have not survived in the texts preserved to us. One might wonder whether we are right in calling such words &quot;neologisms&quot;.

The words used derived from a wider set of authors than just the &quot;classical&quot; period, especially among authors aiming at a higher level of style. Similarly, some Classical words which were uncommonly used were in much greater currency, such as (glory).

The Latin used in scientific publications can be perceived as tending towards a simpler modern idiom, perhaps following the language patters of the writers&#x27; native language. Often it served a clear, less literary purpose, however, of providing an accurate international Latin text or translation.

====Latin as a spoken language====
 As a learnt language, levels of fluency would have varied. Discussions in specialised topics between specialists, or between educated people from different native language backgrounds would be preferred. Even among highly proficient Latin writers, sometimes spoken skills could be much lower, reflecting reticence for making mistakes in public, or simple lack of oral practice.

As noted below, an important feature of Latin in this period was that pronunciation tended to national or even local practice. This could make especially initial spoken communication difficult between Latinists from different backgrounds, English and French pronunciation being notably odd. In terms of status, the Italian pronunciation tended to have higher status and acceptability.

From some time in the seventeenth century, Latin oral skills began to decline. Complaints about standards of oral Latin can be increasingly found from this time onwards.

====Latin as an official and diplomatic language====
 Official and diplomatic settings are specific cases where the use of oral and conversational Latin would have taken place, in legal settings, in Parliaments, or between negotiators. The use of Latin would extend of course also to set speeches and texts such as treaties, but would also be the medium in which details would be discussed and problems resolved.

Latin was an official language of Poland, recognised and widely used. Between the 9th and 18th centuries, commonly used in foreign relations and popular as a second language among some of the nobility.

Through most of the 17th century, Latin was also supreme as an international language of diplomatic correspondence, used in negotiations between nations and the writing of treaties, e.g. the peace treaties of Osnabrück and Münster (1648). As an auxiliary language to the local vernaculars, Latin appeared in a wide variety of documents. The need to read such documents continued to be important for diplomats.

The use of Latin in diplomatic contexts was especially important for smaller nations which maintained Latin for a variety of international purposes, who therefore pressed for it even as French established itself as a more common medium for diplomacy.

===Eighteenth century decline===
As languages like French, Italian, German, and English became more widely known, the use of an auxiliary language seemed less necessary. With greater readerships, many fields of literature became more national, and as vernaculars became better known, translation across language boundaries became more practical. In short, the utility of Latin in many areas decreased, and with it the output. Nevertheless, Latin continued to be important through the 1700s, especially in higher education, where it remained the dominant language of lectures. In particular fields, such as medicine, biology, law, and theology, Latin retained its grip more fully and for longer, and in some countries, particularly in Scandinavia and eastern Europe, Latin played a stronger role due to the small size of language communities or the need to work across such boundaries with a neutral, mutually acceptable medium.

In school education, Latin came under increasing attack as pupils needed time to study other more practical subjects, but it was not displaced from its dominant position, especially as a skill needed for university entry. Increasingly, even as Latin&#x27;s relevance and pupils&#x27; attainment in it diminished, the language became associated with class boundaries, as a passport to a certain kind of education and social cachet, which were denied to those who were unable to dedicate the time to studying it.

====Latin in school education in the 1700s====
It became a widespread view in the 1700s that Latin and Ancient Greek lacked utility for all but a small minority. The use of Latin in education began to come under serious attack, as the need for education widened, while the relevance of Latin had diminished. However, these changes met resistance.

In the American colonies, calls for more practical education began to grow in the 1750s. In Poland, attempts to roll back the place of Latin were made in 1774, to make it a subject and to give up spoken Latin, but hit resistance and were withdrawn in 1778, when Latin was restored as a spoken medium. Attempts to introduce Italian and reduce Latin teaching in Piedmont in the 1790s also met with problems, not least due to the divergence between the local dialect and standard Italian; the changes were withdrawn, and children continued to learn and read and write in Latin before other languages.

In France, under the , teaching remained largely focused on Latin until the Revolution. Although some moves were made to teach Latin grammar in French, and to learn to read and write in French first, these tended to be limited to urban centres and state-founded colleges such as those in Paris. Children learnt to read and write in Latin before French in most of the countryside until the 1790s. Use of spoken Latin in schools, however, reduced through the century, particularly from the 1750s. Gradually Latin in schools moved from a language taught for usage and production to written comprehension.

====Latin in university education in the 1700s====
 At the academy, however, Latin retained its grip. At the Sorbonne, for instance, Latin remained the dominant language of tuition, with nearly all courses being delivered and examined in Latin. At Oxford, Latin-only rules remained in force, but there is clear evidence of a decline in spoken Latin standards, and it was no longer expected outside of classes. Elsewhere, courses in technical subjects tended to move towards the vernacular, while some were delivered in both Latin and vernaculars. Courses using Italian become more common from the 1750s, in subjects such as commerce and mathematics. In any case, even when courses were delivered in vernaculars, formal occasions such as inaugural lectures and ceremonies often remained in Latin.

====Sciences and Academia====
In the early part of the 1700s, Latin was still making a significant contribution to academic publishing, but was no longer dominant. For example, over 50% of the works published in Oxford between 1690 and 1710 were in Latin, and 31% of the total publications mentioned in the French between 1728 and 1740.

Regional and subject differences counted for a lot in the choice of language and audience. An example of the transition towards the vernacular in England can be seen in Newton&#x27;s writing career, which began in Neo-Latin and ended in English (e.g. &quot;Opticks&quot;, 1704). By contrast, while German philosopher Christian Wolff (1679–1754) popularized German as a language of scholarly instruction and research, and wrote some works in German, he continued to write primarily in Latin, so that his works could more easily reach an international audience (e.g., &quot;Philosophia moralis,&quot; 1750–1753).

Around 20% of academic periodicals were in Latin. Latin was particularly well-used in the German-speaking world, where the vernacular was not as well established. Erudition, theology, science and medicine were topics that were often addressed in Latin, such as by the long-running medical journal printed from 1670 until 1791. Some periodicals were general in nature, such as the , from Prague, launched in 1744.

====Literature and poetry====
As the 18th century progressed, the extensive literature in Latin being produced at the beginning slowly contracted. Latin literature tended to be produced in countries where the vernaculars were by themselves still likely to attract small readerships. Some well known, influential and popular Latin books were produced, for instance , a fantastical allegory in 1741.

====Spoken Latin in the 1700s====
As late as the 1720s, Latin was still used conversationally, and was serviceable as an international auxiliary language between people of different countries who had no other language in common. For instance, the Hanoverian king George I of Great Britain (reigned 1714–1727), who had no command of spoken English, communicated in Latin with his Prime Minister Robert Walpole.

There is also no shortage of recorded complaints about poor standards of spoken Latin in universities and similar settings. While there is also praise, it is clear that oral skills were in decline. In academia, lectures began to include a vernacular summary at the end. In some contexts, such as Poland, it was simply accepted that oral Latin did not need to be perfected as a working administrative language. In other contexts, it led to pressure for the oral use of Latin to be abandoned.

Latin shifted towards increasingly being a written rather than spoken language. Evidence for this includes changes in the use of diacritics in texts, which ceased to be used.

====Diplomacy and official status====
 In the early 18th century, French replaced Latin as the dominant diplomatic language, due to the commanding presence in Europe of the France of Louis XIV. However, Latin continued to be preferred by some smaller nations such as Denmark and Sweden for some time.

Some of the last major international treaties to be written in Latin include the Treaty of Vienna in 1738 and the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739; after the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48) international diplomacy was conducted predominantly in French. Some more minor trade treaties were written in Latin in 1737 and 1756 between Denmark and the Sublime Porte.

Latin retained a significant role in diplomatic correspondence beyond these dates. The Papacy, Holy Roman Empire, Sweden continued to prefer Latin for communications through the century. In any case, due to the need to consult prior historic agreements, Latin remained an important skill for diplomats and was provided for in their training.

Prussia found Latin indispensable as late as 1798, for practical reasons in administering partitioned Poland from the 1770s onwards, where Latin remained the main administrative language. In central Europe, Latin retained an official status in Hungary and Croatia, as a neutral language.

===Nineteenth century===

By 1800, Latin publications were far outnumbered, and often outclassed, by writings in the modern languages. Latin literature lasted longest in very specific fields (e.g. botany and zoology) where it had acquired a technical character, and where a literature available only to a small number of learned individuals could remain viable. By the end of the 19th century, Latin in some instances functioned less as a language than as a code capable of concise and exact expression, as for instance in physicians&#x27; prescriptions, or in a botanist&#x27;s description of a specimen. In other fields (e.g. anatomy or law) where Latin had been widely used, it survived in technical phrases and terminology. The perpetuation of Ecclesiastical Latin in the Catholic Church through the 20th century can be considered a special case of the technicalizing of Latin, and the narrowing of its use to an elite class of readers.

====Latin and Classical education====
Despite the trends in the 1700s towards lessening emphasis on Latin, study of the language alongside Greek was given a significant boost after 1800 through a revival of humanist education, especially for elite education in France, Germany, England and elsewhere.

In this model, Latin suffered in status against Ancient Greek, which was seen as the better aesthetic example, but both languages were deemed necessary for a &quot;Classical education&quot;. Latin was still generally a requirement for University education. Composition skills were still needed for submission of theses, for instance, in the early part of the century.

In England, study of the Classics became more intense at institutions like Eton, or Charterhouse. In grammar schools, however, study of Latin had declined, stopped or become tokenistic in the majority of cases at the point of the Taunton Commission&#x27;s enquiry in 1864, a situation which it helped to reverse in the coming decades.

The renewed emphasis on the study of Classical Latin as the spoken language of the Romans of the 1st centuries BC and AD, was similar to that of the Humanists but based on broader linguistic, historical, and critical studies of Latin literature. It led to the exclusion of Neo-Latin literature from academic studies in schools and universities (except for advanced historical language studies); to the abandonment of Neo-Latin neologisms; and to an increasing interest in the reconstructed Classical pronunciation, which displaced the several regional pronunciations in Europe in the early 20th century.

Coincident with these changes in Latin instruction, and to some degree motivating them, came a concern about lack of Latin proficiency among students. Latin had already lost its privileged role as the core subject of elementary instruction; and as education spread to the middle and lower classes, it tended to be dropped altogether.

Latin and the Classics were under pressure from the need for much broader, general education for the wider population. It was clearly not useful or appropriate for everyone to attain high levels of Latin or Greek. Nevertheless, as a requirement for University entry, it formed a barrier to access against people from less privileged backgrounds; this was even seen as good thing. In this way, education in Latin became increasingly associated with a kind of elitism, associated with the education of English &quot;gentlemen&quot; or the French bourgeoisie, and forming a common bond of references within these social classes.

====Latin and linguistics====
As academic study of languages in Germany and elsewhere intensified, so did knowledge of Latin. This manifested itself in the proposal for restoring Classical pronunciation, but also in further refining knowledge of vowel quantity, use of grammatical constructions and the meaning of particular words. Study of non-standard Latin began. Overall, this intensified the purification, standardisation and academisation of Latin. In education, this led to an increasingly grammar based approach to learning in many countries, reinforcing its reputation for being difficult and abstruse.

====Uses of Latin in the late 1800s====

By 1900, creative Latin composition in many countries, for purely artistic purposes, had become rare. Authors such as Arthur Rimbaud and Max Beerbohm wrote Latin verse, but these texts were either school exercises or occasional pieces. However, the tradition was still strong enough in Holland, Croatia, Italy and elsewhere to sustain an annual Latin poetry competition, the , until 1978.

Classicists themselves were the last redoubt for use of Latin in an academic context. Textual commentaries to Latin texts could be made in Latin, for instance. Academic papers in Classics journals could sometimes be published in Latin.

Some of the last survivals of Neo-Latin to convey information appear in the use of Latin to cloak passages and expressions deemed too indecent to be read by children, the lower classes, or (most) women. Such passages appear in translations of foreign texts and in works on folklore, anthropology, and psychology. An example of this can be found in Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s (1886).

====Official uses of Latin====
A special case was the use of Latin in Hungary and Croatia, where it remained a language of government in the first half of the century. Papers were published in Latin in Hungary, and it was used as the language of Parliamentary debate. This was in large part a compromise between Hungarians and Croats, to both avoid the imposition of German, or their own languages, on each other. The legacy of the political situation meant that a strong Latin tradition continued in Croatia for some time afterwards, where Latin poetry continued to be produced for the remainder of the century.

The abolition of the Holy Roman Empire ended its use of Latin as an official language. Sweden continued to use Latin for diplomatic correspondence in the nineteenth century, as did the Vatican.

===Latin from 1900 onwards===
Latin as a language held a place of educational pre-eminence until the second half of the 19th century in the English speaking world. At that point its value was increasingly questioned; in the 20th century, educational philosophies such as that of John Dewey dismissed its relevance. At the same time, the philological study of Latin appeared to show that the traditional methods and materials for teaching Latin were dangerously out of date and ineffective.

===Relics===

Ecclesiastical Latin, the form of Neo-Latin used in the Catholic Church, remained in use throughout the period and after. Until the Second Vatican Council of 1962–1965 all priests were expected to have competency in it, and it was studied in Catholic schools. It is today still the official language of the Church, and all Catholic priests of the Latin liturgical rites are required by canon law to have competency in the language.

Neo-Latin is also the source of the biological system of binomial nomenclature and classification of living organisms devised by Carl Linnaeus, although the rules of the ICZN allow the construction of names that deviate considerably from historical norms. (See also classical compounds.) Another continuation is the use of Latin names for the surface features of planets and planetary satellites (planetary nomenclature), originated in the mid-17th century for selenographic toponyms. Neo-Latin has also contributed a vocabulary for specialized fields such as anatomy and law; some of these words have become part of the normal, non-technical vocabulary of various European languages.

==Pronunciation==

Neo-Latin had no single pronunciation, but a host of local variants or dialects, all distinct both from each other and from the historical pronunciation of Latin at the time of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. As a rule, the local pronunciation of Latin used sounds identical to those of the dominant local language, the result of a concurrently evolving pronunciation in the living languages and the corresponding spoken dialects of Latin. Despite this variation, there are some common characteristics to nearly all of the dialects of Neo-Latin, for instance:
* The use of a sibilant fricative or affricate in place of a stop for the letters &quot;c&quot; and sometimes &quot;g&quot;, when preceding a front vowel.
* The use of a sibilant fricative or affricate for the letter &quot;t&quot; when not at the beginning of the first syllable and preceding an unstressed &quot;i&quot; followed by a vowel.
* The use of a labiodental fricative for most instances of the letter &quot;v&quot; (or consonantal &quot;u&quot;), instead of the classical labiovelar approximant .
* A tendency for medial &quot;s&quot; to be voiced to , especially between vowels.
* The merger of &quot;æ&quot; and &quot;œ&quot; with &quot;e&quot;, and of &quot;y&quot; with &quot;i&quot;.
* The loss of the distinction between short and long vowels, with such vowel distinctions as remain being dependent upon word-stress.

The regional dialects of Neo-Latin can be grouped into families, according to the extent to which they share common traits of pronunciation. The major division is between Western and Eastern family of Neo-Latin. The Western family includes most Romance-speaking regions (France, Spain, Portugal, Italy) and the British Isles; the Eastern family includes Central Europe (Germany and Poland), Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine) and Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden).

The Western family is characterized, , by having a front variant of the letter &quot;g&quot; before the vowels &quot;æ, e, i, œ, y&quot; and also pronouncing &quot;j&quot; in the same way (except in Italy). In the Eastern Latin family, &quot;j&quot; is always pronounced , and &quot;g&quot; had the same sound (usually ) in front of both front and back vowels; exceptions developed later in some Scandinavian countries.

The following table illustrates some of the variation of Neo-Latin consonants found in various countries of Europe, compared to the Classical Latin pronunciation of the 1st centuries BC to AD. In Eastern Europe, the pronunciation of Latin was generally similar to that shown in the table below for German, but usually with for &quot;z&quot; instead of .

==Orthography==

Neo-Latin texts are primarily found in early printed editions, which present certain features of spelling and the use of diacritics distinct from the Latin of antiquity, medieval Latin manuscript conventions, and representations of Latin in modern printed editions.

===Characters===
In spelling, Neo-Latin, in all but the earliest texts, distinguishes the letter &quot;u&quot; from &quot;v&quot; and &quot;i&quot; from &quot;j&quot;. In older texts printed down to , &quot;v&quot; was used in initial position (even when it represented a vowel, e.g. in &quot;vt&quot;, later printed &quot;ut&quot;) and &quot;u&quot; was used elsewhere, e.g. in &quot;nouus&quot;, later printed &quot;novus&quot;. By the mid-17th century, the letter &quot;v&quot; was commonly used for the consonantal sound of Roman V, which in most pronunciations of Latin in the Neo-Latin period was (and not ), as in &quot;vulnus&quot; &quot;wound&quot;, &quot;corvus&quot; &quot;crow&quot;. Where the pronunciation remained , as after &quot;g&quot;, &quot;q&quot; and &quot;s&quot;, the spelling &quot;u&quot; continued to be used for the consonant, e.g. in &quot;lingua&quot;, &quot;qualis&quot;, and &quot;suadeo&quot;.

The letter &quot;j&quot; generally represented a consonantal sound (pronounced in various ways in different European countries, e.g. , , , ). It appeared, for instance, in &quot;jam&quot; &quot;already&quot; or &quot;jubet&quot; &quot;he/she orders&quot; (earlier spelled &quot;iam&quot; and &quot;iubet&quot;).
It was also found between vowels in the words &quot;ejus&quot;, &quot;hujus&quot;, &quot;cujus&quot; (earlier spelled &quot;eius, huius, cuius&quot;), and pronounced as a consonant; likewise in such forms as &quot;major&quot; and &quot;pejor&quot;. &quot;J&quot; was also used when the last in a sequence of two or more &quot;i&quot;&#x27;s, e.g. &quot;radij&quot; (now spelled &quot;radii&quot;) &quot;rays&quot;, &quot;alijs&quot; &quot;to others&quot;, &quot;iij&quot;, the Roman numeral 3; however, &quot;ij&quot; was for the most part replaced by &quot;ii&quot; by 1700.

In common with texts in other languages using the Roman alphabet, Latin texts down to used the letter-form &quot;ſ&quot; (the &quot;long s&quot;) for &quot;s&quot; in positions other than at the end of a word; e.g. &quot;ipſiſſimus&quot;.

The digraphs &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; were typically written using the ligatures &quot;æ&quot; and &quot;œ&quot; (e.g. &quot;Cæsar&quot;, &quot;pœna&quot;) except when part of a word in all capitals, such as in titles, chapter headings, or captions. More rarely (and usually in 16th- to early 17th-century texts) the e caudata was used as a substitute for the digraphs.

===Diacritics===

Three kinds of diacritic were in common use: the acute accent ´, the grave accent `, and the circumflex accent ˆ. These were normally only marked on vowels (e.g. í, è, â); but see below regarding &quot;que&quot;.
The acute accent marked a stressed syllable, but was usually confined to those where the stress was not in its normal position, as determined by vowel length and syllabic weight. In practice, it was typically found on the vowel in the syllable immediately preceding a final clitic, particularly &quot;que&quot; &quot;and&quot;, &quot;ve&quot; &quot;or&quot; and &quot;ne&quot;, a question marker; e.g. &quot;idémque&quot; &quot;and the same (thing)&quot;. Some printers, however, put this acute accent over the &quot;q&quot; in the enclitic &quot;que&quot;, e.g. &quot;eorumq́ue&quot; &quot;and their&quot;. The acute accent fell out of favor by the 19th century.

The grave accent had various uses, none related to pronunciation or stress. It was always found on the preposition &quot;à&quot; (variant of &quot;ab&quot; &quot;by&quot; or &quot;from&quot;) and likewise on the preposition &quot;è&quot; (variant of &quot;ex&quot; &quot;from&quot; or &quot;out of&quot;). It might also be found on the interjection &quot;ò&quot; &quot;O&quot;. Most frequently, it was found on the last (or only) syllable of various adverbs and conjunctions, particularly those that might be confused with prepositions or with inflected forms of nouns, verbs, or adjectives. Examples include &quot;certè&quot; &quot;certainly&quot;, &quot;verò&quot; &quot;but&quot;, &quot;primùm&quot; &quot;at first&quot;, &quot;pòst&quot; &quot;afterwards&quot;, &quot;cùm&quot; &quot;when&quot;, &quot;adeò&quot; &quot;so far, so much&quot;, &quot;unà&quot; &quot;together&quot;, &quot;quàm&quot; &quot;than&quot;. In some texts the grave was found over the clitics such as &quot;que&quot;, in which case the acute accent did not appear before them.

The circumflex accent represented metrical length (generally not distinctively pronounced in the Neo-Latin period) and was chiefly found over an &quot;a&quot; representing an ablative singular case, e.g. &quot;eâdem formâ&quot; &quot;with the same shape&quot;. It might also be used to distinguish two words otherwise spelled identically, but distinct in vowel length; e.g. &quot;hîc&quot; &quot;here&quot; differentiated from &quot;hic&quot; &quot;this&quot;, &quot;fugêre&quot; &quot;they have fled&quot; (=&quot;fūgērunt&quot;) distinguished from &quot;fugere&quot; &quot;to flee&quot;, or &quot;senatûs&quot; &quot;of the senate&quot; distinct from &quot;senatus&quot; &quot;the senate&quot;. It might also be used for vowels arising from contraction, e.g. &quot;nôsti&quot; for &quot;novisti&quot; &quot;you know&quot;, &quot;imperâsse&quot; for &quot;imperavisse&quot; &quot;to have commanded&quot;, or &quot;dî&quot; for &quot;dei&quot; or &quot;dii&quot;.

<text>:&quot;See also Naive set theory for the mathematical topic.&quot;
Naive Set Theory is a mathematics textbook by Paul Halmos providing an undergraduate introduction to set theory. Originally published by &quot;Van Nostrand&quot; in 1960, it was reprinted in the Springer-Verlag Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics series in 1974.

While the title states that the set theory presented is &#x27;naive&#x27;, which is usually taken to mean without formal axioms, the book does introduce a system of axioms equivalent to that of ZFC set theory except the Axiom of foundation. It also gives correct and rigorous definitions for many basic concepts. Where it differs from a &quot;true&quot; axiomatic set theory book is its character: there are no discussions of axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about advanced topics such as large cardinals or forcing. Instead, it tries to be intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before.

Halmos later stated that it was the fastest book he wrote, taking about six months, and that the book &quot;wrote itself&quot;.

==Axioms used in the book==

The statements of the axioms given below are as they appear in the book, with section references, and with explanatory commentary on each one. The &quot;principal primitive (undefined) concept of &quot;belonging&quot;&quot; (that is, set membership) is the starting point, where &quot;formula_1 belongs to formula_2&quot; is written in the usual notation as formula_3. Here formula_1 and formula_2 are both sets, with the notational distinction of upper/lower case a purely stylistic choice. The axioms govern the properties of this relation between sets.

1. Axiom of Extension (Section 1): two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements.

This guarantees that the membership and (logical) equality relations interact appropriately.

2. Axiom of Specification (Section 2): To every set formula_2 and every condition formula_7 there corresponds a set formula_8 whose elements are precisely those elements of formula_2 for which formula_7 holds.

This is more properly an axiom schema (that is, each condition formula_7 gives rise to an axiom). &quot;Condition&quot; here means a &quot;sentence&quot; in which the variable formula_1 (ranging over all sets) is a free variable. &quot;Sentences&quot; are defined as being built up from smaller sentences using first order logical operations (and, or, not), including quantifiers (&quot;there exists&quot;, &quot;for all&quot;), and with atomic (i.e. basic starting) sentences formula_3 and formula_14.

This schema is used in 4.-7. below to cut down the set that is stated to exist to the set containing precisely the intended elements, rather than some larger set with extraneous elements. For example, the axiom of pairing applied to the sets formula_2 and formula_8 only guarantees there is &quot;some&quot; set formula_17 such that formula_18 and formula_19. Specification can be used to then construct the set formula_20 with &quot;just&quot; those elements.

3. Set existence (Section 3): There exists a set.

Not specified as an named axiom, but instead stated to be &quot;officially assumed&quot;. This assumption is not necessary once the axiom of infinity is adopted later, which also specifies the existence of a set (with a certain property). The existence of any set at all is used to show the empty set exists using the axiom of specification.

4. Axiom of pairing (Section 3): For any two sets there exists a set that they both belong to.

This is used to show that the singleton formula_21 containing a given set formula_2 exists.

5. Axiom of unions (Section 4): For every collection of sets there exists a set that contains all the elements that belong to at least one set of the given collection.

In Section 1 Halmos writes that &quot;to avoid terminological monotony, we shall sometimes say &quot;collection&quot; instead of set.&quot; Hence this axiom is equivalent to the usual form of the axiom of unions (given the axiom of specification, as noted above).

From the axioms so far Halmos gives a construction of intersections of sets, and the usual Boolean operations on sets are described and their properties proved.

6. Axiom of powers (Section 5): For each set there exists a collection of sets that contains among its elements all the subsets of the given set.

Again (noting that &quot;collection&quot; means &quot;set&quot;) using the axiom (schema) of specification we can cut down to get the power set formula_23 of a set formula_2, whose elements are precisely the subsets of formula_2. The axioms so far are used to construct the cartesian product of sets.

7. Axiom of infinity (Section 11): There exists a set containing 0 and containing the successor of each of its elements.

The set formula_26. The &quot;successor&quot; of a set formula_1 is defined to be the set formula_28. For example: formula_29. This axiom ensures the existence of a set containing formula_30 and hence formula_31, and hence formula_32 and so on. This implies that there is a set containing all the elements of the first infinite von Neumann ordinal formula_33. And another application of the axiom (schema) of specification means formula_33 itself is a set.

8. Axiom of choice (Section 15): The Cartesian product of a non-empty family of non-empty sets is non-empty.

This is one of many equivalents to the axiom of choice. Note here that &quot;family&quot; is defined to be a function formula_35, with the intuitive idea that the sets of the family are the sets formula_36 for formula_37 ranging over the set formula_38, and in usual notation this axiom says that there is at least one element in formula_39, as long as formula_40 for all formula_41.

9. Axiom of substitution (Section 19): If formula_42 is a sentence such that for each formula_43 in a set formula_2 the set formula_45 can be formed, then there exists a function formula_46 with domain formula_2 such that formula_48 for each formula_43 in formula_2.

A function formula_51 is defined to be a functional relation (i.e. a certain subset of formula_52), not as a certain type of set of ordered pairs, as in ZFC, for instance.

This &#x27;axiom&#x27; is essentially the axiom schema of collection, which, given the other axioms, is equivalent to the axiom schema of replacement. It is the collection schema rather than replacement, because 1) formula_42 is a class &quot;relation&quot; instead of a class function and 2) the function formula_46 is not specified to have codomain precisely the set formula_55, but merely some set formula_56.

This axiom is used in the book to a) construct limit von Neumann ordinals after the first infinite ordinal formula_33, and b) prove that every well-ordered set is order isomorphic to a unique von Neumann ordinal.

== Relation to other axiom systems for set theory ==

Note that axioms 1.-9. are equivalent to the axiom system of ZFC-Foundation (that is ZFC without the Foundation axiom), since as noted above, Halmos&#x27; axiom (schema) of substitution is equivalent to the axiom schema of replacement, in the presence of the other axioms. 

Additionally, axioms 1.-8. are nearly exactly those of Zermelo set theory ZC; the only difference being that the set existence assumption is replaced in ZC by the existence of the empty set, and the existence of singletons is stated outright for ZC, rather than proved, as above. Additionally, the infinite set that is asserted to exist by the axiom of infinity is not the one that Zermelo originally postulated,[a] but Halmos&#x27; version is sometimes silently substituted for it in treatments of Zermelo set theory.

That the axiom (schema) of substitution is stated last and so late in the book is testament to how much elementary set theory—and indeed mathematics more generally—can be done without it. As a very simple example of what is &quot;is&quot; needed for, the von Neumann ordinal formula_58 (that is, the second limit ordinal) cannot be proved to be a set using only axioms 1.-8., even though sets with well-orderings with this order type can be constructed from these axioms. For instance formula_59, with an ordering placing all elements of the first copy of formula_33 less than the second. Working with von Neumann ordinals in place of generic well-orderings has technical advantages, not least the fact every well-ordering is order isomorphic to a &quot;unique&quot; von Neumann ordinal.

As noted above, the book omits the Axiom of Foundation (also known as the Axiom of Regularity). Halmos repeatedly dances around the issue of whether or not a set can contain itself.
*p. 1: &quot;a set may also be an element of some &quot;other&quot; set&quot; (emphasis added)
*p. 3: &quot;is formula_61 ever true? It is certainly not true of any reasonable set that anyone has ever seen.&quot;
*p. 6: &quot;formula_62 ... unlikely, but not obviously impossible&quot;
But Halmos does let us prove that there are certain sets that cannot contain themselves.
*p. 44: Halmos lets us prove that formula_63. For if formula_64, then formula_65 would still be a successor set, because formula_66 and formula_33 is not the successor of any natural number. But formula_33 is not a subset of formula_69, contradicting the definition of formula_33 as a subset of every successor set.
*p. 47: Halmos proves the lemma that &quot;no natural number is a subset of any of its elements.&quot; This lets us prove that no natural number can contain itself. For if formula_71, where formula_72 is a natural number, then formula_73, which contradicts the lemma.
*p. 75: &quot;An &quot;ordinal number&quot; is defined as a well ordered set formula_74 such that formula_75 for all formula_76 in formula_74; here formula_78 is, as before, the initial segment formula_79 formula_80}.&quot; The well ordering is defined as follows: if formula_76 and formula_82 are elements of an ordinal number formula_74, then formula_84 means formula_85 (pp. 75-76). By his choice of the symbol formula_86 instead of formula_87, Halmos implies that the well ordering formula_86 is strict (pp. 55-56). This definition of formula_86 makes it impossible to have formula_90, where formula_76 is an element of an ordinal number. That&#x27;s because formula_92 means formula_93, which implies formula_94 (because &lt; is strict), which is impossible.
*p. 75: the above definition of an ordinal number also makes it impossible to have formula_95, where formula_74 is an ordinal number. That&#x27;s because formula_95 implies formula_98. This gives us formula_99, which implies formula_100, which implies formula_101 (because formula_86 is strict), which is impossible.

==Errata==
*p. 4, line 18: “Cain and Abel” should be “Seth, Cain and Abel”.
*p. 30, line 10: &quot;formula_1 onto formula_104&quot; should be &quot;formula_1 into formula_104&quot;.
*p, 66, line 16: &quot;Consider, for example, the set formula_107 of all those pairs formula_108 for which formula_109; the set formula_107 has formula_111 for its least element.&quot;: the statement is not true, since formula_112. In fact formula_113.
*p. 73, line 19: &quot;for each formula_114 in formula_17&quot; should be &quot;for each formula_43 in formula_17&quot;.
*p. 75, line 3: &quot;if and only if formula_118&quot; should be &quot;if and only if formula_119&quot;.
*p, 100, line 11: &quot;then formula_120&quot; should be &quot;then formula_121&quot;.

==Notes==
: - In fact given the rest of the axioms, neither of the original Zermelo axiom of infinity, nor Halmos&#x27; axiom of infinity, can be proven from the other, even if one adds in the axiom of foundation. That is, one cannot construct the infinite set Halmos&#x27; axiom asserts exists, from the infinite set Zermelo&#x27;s original axioms assert exists, and vice versa. The axiom schema of Replacement, on the other hand, &quot;does&quot; allow the construction of either of these infinite sets from the other.

<doc id="21989" wikidata="Q272467" url="?curid=21989" title="Nitrogen fixation">
<text>Nitrogen fixation is a chemical process by which molecular dinitrogen () is converted into ammonia (). It occurs both biologically and abiologically in chemical industries. Biological nitrogen fixation or &quot;diazotrophy&quot; is catalyzed by enzymes called nitrogenases. These enzyme complexes are encoded by the &quot;Nif&quot; genes (or &quot;Nif&quot; homologs) and contain iron, often with a second metal (usually molybdenum, but sometimes vanadium).

Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria have symbiotic relationships with plants, especially legumes, mosses and aquatic ferns such as &quot;Azolla&quot;. Looser non-symbiotic relationships between diazotrophs and plants are often referred to as associative, as seen in nitrogen fixation on rice roots. Nitrogen fixation occurs between some termites and fungi. It occurs naturally in the air by means of NOx production by lightning.

Nitrogen fixation is essential to life on Earth because fixed inorganic nitrogen compounds are required for the biosynthesis of all nitrogen-containing organic compounds such as amino acids, polypeptides and proteins, nucleoside triphosphates and nucleic acids. As part of the nitrogen cycle, it is essential for soil fertility and the growth of terrestrial and semiaquatic vegetations, upon which all consumers of those ecosystems rely for biomass. Nitrogen fixation is thus crucial to the food security of human societies in sustaining agricultural yields (especially staple crops), livestock feeds (forage or fodder) and fishery (both wild and farmed) harvests. It is also indirectly relevant to the manufacture of all nitrogenous industrial products, which include fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, textiles, dyes and explosives.

== History ==

Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered by Jean-Baptiste Boussingault in 1838. Later, in 1880, the process by which it happens was discovered by German agronomist Hermann Hellriegel and and was fully described by Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck.

&quot;The protracted investigations of the relation of plants to the acquisition of nitrogen begun by de Saussure, Ville, Lawes, Gilbert and others, and culminated in the discovery of symbiotic fixation by Hellriegel and Wilfarth in 1887.&quot;

&quot;Experiments by Bossingault in 1855 and Pugh, Gilbert &amp; Lawes in 1887 had shown that nitrogen did not enter the plant directly. The discovery of the role of nitrogen fixing bacteria by Herman Hellriegel and Herman Wilfarth in 1886–1888 would open a new era of soil science.&quot;

In 1901, Beijerinck showed that &quot;Azotobacter chroococcum&quot; was able to fix atmospheric nitrogen. This was the first species of the &quot;azotobacter&quot; genus, so-named by him. It is also the first known diazotroph, species that use diatomic nitrogen as a step in the complete nitrogen cycle.

== Biological ==
Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) occurs when atmospheric nitrogen is converted to ammonia by a nitrogenase enzyme. The overall reaction for BNF is:

The process is coupled to the hydrolysis of 16 equivalents of ATP and is accompanied by the co-formation of one equivalent of . The conversion of into ammonia occurs at a metal cluster called FeMoco, an abbreviation for the iron-molybdenum cofactor. The mechanism proceeds via a series of protonation and reduction steps wherein the FeMoco active site hydrogenates the substrate. In free-living diazotrophs, nitrogenase-generated ammonia is assimilated into glutamate through the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway. The microbial nif genes required for nitrogen fixation are widely distributed in diverse environments.

For example, decomposing wood, which generally has a low nitrogen content, has been shown to host a diazotrophic community. The bacteria enrich the wood substrate with nitrogen through fixation, thus enabling deadwood decomposition by fungi.

Nitrogenases are rapidly degraded by oxygen. For this reason, many bacteria cease production of the enzyme in the presence of oxygen. Many nitrogen-fixing organisms exist only in anaerobic conditions, respiring to draw down oxygen levels, or binding the oxygen with a protein such as leghemoglobin.

=== Importance of nitrogen ===

Atmospheric nitrogen is inaccessible to most organisms, because its triple covalent bond is very strong. Most take up fixed nitrogen from various sources. For every 100 atoms of carbon, roughly 2 to 20 atoms of nitrogen are assimilated. The atomic ratio of carbon (C) : nitrogen (N) : phosphorus (P) observed on average in planktonic biomass was originally described by Alfred Redfield, who determined the stoichiometric relationship between C:N:P atoms, The Redfield Ratio, to be 106:16:1.

=== Nitrogenase ===

The protein complex nitrogenase is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of nitrogen gas (N2) to ammonia (NH3). In cyanobacteria, this enzyme system is housed in a specialized cell called the heterocyst. The production of the nitrogenase complex is genetically regulated, and the activity of the protein complex is dependent on ambient oxygen concentrations, and intra- and extracellular concentrations of ammonia and oxidized nitrogen species (nitrate and nitrite). Additionally, the combined concentrations of both ammonium and nitrate are thought to inhibit NFix, specifically when intracellular concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) exceed a critical threshold. The specialized heterocyst cell is necessary for the performance of nitrogenase as a result of its sensitivity to ambient oxygen.

Nitrogenase consist of two proteins, a catalytic iron-dependent protein, commonly referred to as MoFe protein and a reducing iron-only protein (Fe protein). There are three different iron dependent proteins, molybdenum-dependent, vanadium-dependent, and iron-only, with all three nitrogenase protein variations containing an iron protein component. Molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase is the most commonly present nitrogenase. The different types of nitrogenase can be determined by the specific iron protein component. Nitrogenase is highly conserved. Gene expression through DNA sequencing can distinguish which protein complex is present in the microorganism and potentially being expressed. Most frequently, the &quot;nif&quot;H gene is used to identify the presence of molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase, followed by closely related nitrogenase reductases (component II) &quot;vnf&quot;H and &quot;anf&quot;H representing vanadium-dependent and iron-only nitrogenase, respectively. In studying the ecology and evolution of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the &quot;nifH&quot; gene is the biomarker most widely used. &quot;nif&quot;H has two similar genes &quot;anf&quot;H and vnfH that also encode for the nitrogenase reductase component of the nitrogenase complex.

=== Evolution of Nitrogenase ===
Nitrogenase is thought to have evolved sometime between 1.5-2.2 billion years ago (Ga), although some isotopic support showing nitrogenase evolution as early as around 3.2 Ga. Nitrogenase appears to have evolved from maturase-like proteins, although the function of the preceding protein is currently unknown.

Nitrogenase has three different forms (&quot;Nif, Anf, and Vnf&quot;) that correspond with the metal found in the active site of the protein (Molybdenum, Iron, and Vanadium respectively). Marine metal abundances over Earth’s geologic timeline are thought to have driven the relative abundance of which form of nitrogenase was most common. Currently, there is no conclusive agreement on which form of nitrogenase arose first.

===Microorganisms===

Diazotrophs are widespread within domain Bacteria including cyanobacteria (e.g. the highly significant &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; and &quot;Cyanothece&quot;), green sulfur bacteria, purple sulfur bacteria, Azotobacteraceae, rhizobia and &quot;Frankia.&quot; Several obligately anaerobic bacteria fix nitrogen including many (but not all) &quot;Clostridium&quot; spp. Some archaea such as &quot;Methanosarcina acetivorans&quot; also fix nitrogen, and several other methanogenic taxa, are significant contributors to nitrogen fixation in oxygen-deficient soils.

Cyanobacteria, commonly known as blue-green algae, inhabit nearly all illuminated environments on Earth and play key roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycle of the biosphere. In general, cyanobacteria can use various inorganic and organic sources of combined nitrogen, such as nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, urea, or some amino acids. Several cyanobacteria strains are also capable of diazotrophic growth, an ability that may have been present in their last common ancestor in the Archean eon. Nitrogen fixation not only naturally occurs in soils but also aquatic systems, including both freshwater and marine. Indeed, the amount of nitrogen fixed in the ocean is at least as much as that on land. The colonial marine cyanobacterium &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is thought to fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen fixation in marine systems globally. Marine surface lichens and non-photosynthetic bacteria belonging in Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes fixate significant atmospheric nitrogen. Species of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria in fresh waters include: &quot;Aphanizomenon&quot; and &quot;Dolichospermum&quot; (previously Anabaena). Such species have specialized cells called heterocytes, in which nitrogen fixation occurs via the nitrogenase enzyme.

=== Algae ===
One type of organelle, originating from cyanobacterial endosymbionts called UCYN-A2, can turn nitrogen gas into a biologically available form. This nitroplast was discovered in algae, particularly in the marine algae Braarudosphaera bigelowii.

Diatoms in the family &quot;Rhopalodiaceae&quot; also possess cyanobacterial endosymbionts called spheroid bodies or diazoplasts. These endosymbionts have lost photosynthetic properties, but have kept the ability to perform nitrogen fixation, allowing these diatoms to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Other diatoms in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are among the genera &quot;Hemiaulus&quot;, &quot;Rhizosolenia&quot; and &quot;Chaetoceros&quot;.

===Root nodule symbioses===
====Legume family====

Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include those of the legume family—Fabaceae— with taxa such as kudzu, clover, soybean, alfalfa, lupin, peanut and rooibos. They contain symbiotic rhizobia bacteria within nodules in their root systems, producing nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow and compete with other plants. When the plant dies, the fixed nitrogen is released, making it available to other plants; this helps to fertilize the soil. The great majority of legumes have this association, but a few genera (e.g., &quot;Styphnolobium&quot;) do not. In many traditional farming practices, fields are rotated through various types of crops, which usually include one consisting mainly or entirely of clover.

Fixation efficiency in soil is dependent on many factors, including the legume and air and soil conditions. For example, nitrogen fixation by red clover can range from .

==== Non-leguminous ====
The ability to fix nitrogen in nodules is present in actinorhizal plants such as alder and bayberry, with the help of &quot;Frankia&quot; bacteria. They are found in 25 genera in the orders Cucurbitales, Fagales and Rosales, which together with the Fabales form a &quot;nitrogen-fixing clade&quot; of eurosids. The ability to fix nitrogen is not universally present in these families. For example, of 122 Rosaceae genera, only four fix nitrogen. Fabales were the first lineage to branch off this nitrogen-fixing clade; thus, the ability to fix nitrogen may be plesiomorphic and subsequently lost in most descendants of the original nitrogen-fixing plant; however, it may be that the basic genetic and physiological requirements were present in an incipient state in the most recent common ancestors of all these plants, but only evolved to full function in some of them.

In addition, &quot;Trema&quot; (&quot;Parasponia&quot;), a tropical genus in the family Cannabaceae, is unusually able to interact with rhizobia and form nitrogen-fixing nodules.

=== Other plant symbionts ===
Some other plants live in association with a cyanobiont (cyanobacteria such as &quot;Nostoc&quot;) which fix nitrogen for them:
* Some lichens such as &quot;Lobaria&quot; and &quot;Peltigera&quot;
* Mosquito fern (&quot;Azolla&quot; species)
* Cycads
* &quot;Gunnera&quot;
* &quot;Blasia&quot; (liverwort)
* Hornworts

Some symbiotic relationships involving agriculturally-important plants are:
* Sugarcane and unclear endophytes
* Foxtail millet and &quot;Azospirillum brasilense&quot;
* Kallar grass and &quot;Azoarcus&quot; sp. strain BH72
* Rice and &quot;Herbaspirillum seropedicae&quot;
* Wheat and &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;
* Maize landrace &#x27;Sierra Mixe&#x27; / &#x27;olotón&#x27; and various Bacteroidota and Pseudomonadota

== Industrial processes ==

=== Historical ===
A method for nitrogen fixation was first described by Henry Cavendish in 1784 using electric arcs reacting nitrogen and oxygen in air. This method was implemented in the Birkeland–Eyde process of 1903. The fixation of nitrogen by lightning is a very similar natural occurring process.

The possibility that atmospheric nitrogen reacts with certain chemicals was first observed by Desfosses in 1828. He observed that mixtures of alkali metal oxides and carbon react with nitrogen at high temperatures. With the use of barium carbonate as starting material, the first commercial process became available in the 1860s, developed by Margueritte and Sourdeval. The resulting barium cyanide reacts with steam, yielding ammonia. In 1898 Frank and Caro developed what is known as the Frank–Caro process to fix nitrogen in the form of calcium cyanamide. The process was eclipsed by the Haber process, which was discovered in 1909.

=== Haber process ===
The dominant industrial method for producing ammonia is the Haber process also known as the Haber-Bosch process. Fertilizer production is now the largest source of human-produced fixed nitrogen in the terrestrial ecosystem. Ammonia is a required precursor to fertilizers, explosives, and other products. The Haber process requires high pressures (around 200 atm) and high temperatures (at least 400 °C), which are routine conditions for industrial catalysis. This process uses natural gas as a hydrogen source and air as a nitrogen source. The ammonia product has resulted in an intensification of nitrogen fertilizer globally and is credited with supporting the expansion of the human population from around 2 billion in the early 20th century to roughly 8 billion people now.

=== Homogeneous catalysis ===

Much research has been conducted on the discovery of catalysts for nitrogen fixation, often with the goal of lowering energy requirements. However, such research has thus far failed to approach the efficiency and ease of the Haber process. Many compounds react with atmospheric nitrogen to give dinitrogen complexes. The first dinitrogen complex to be reported was ()2+. Some soluble complexes do catalyze nitrogen fixation.

== Lightning ==

Nitrogen can be fixed by lightning converting nitrogen gas () and oxygen gas () in the atmosphere into (nitrogen oxides). The molecule is highly stable and nonreactive due to the triple bond between the nitrogen atoms. Lightning produces enough energy and heat to break this bond allowing nitrogen atoms to react with oxygen, forming . These compounds cannot be used by plants, but as this molecule cools, it reacts with oxygen to form , which in turn reacts with water to produce (nitrous acid) or (nitric acid). When these acids seep into the soil, they make NO3− (nitrate), which is of use to plants.

<text>Naguib Mahfouz Abdelaziz Ibrahim Ahmed Al-Basha (, ; 11 December 1911 – 30 August 2006) was an Egyptian writer who won the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature. In awarding the prize, the Swedish Academy described him as a writer &quot;who, through works rich in nuance – now clear-sightedly realistic, now evocatively ambiguous – has formed an Arabian narrative art that applies to all mankind&quot;. Mahfouz is regarded as one of the first contemporary writers in Arabic literature, along with Taha Hussein, to explore themes of existentialism. He is the only Egyptian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. He published 35 novels, over 350 short stories, 26 screenplays, hundreds of op-ed columns for Egyptian newspapers, and seven plays over a 70-year career, from the 1930s until 2004. All of his novels take place in Egypt, and always mention the lane which equals the world. His most famous works include &quot;The Cairo Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Children of Gebelawi&quot;. Many of Mahfouz&#x27;s works have been made into Egyptian and foreign films; no Arab writer exceeds Mahfouz in number of works that have been adapted for cinema and television. While Mahfouz&#x27;s literature is classified as realist literature, existential themes appear in it.

==Early life and education==
Mahfouz was born in a lower middle-class Muslim Egyptian family in Old Cairo in 1911. The first part of his compound given name was chosen in appreciation of the well-known obstetrician, Naguib Pasha Mahfouz, who oversaw his difficult birth. Mahfouz was the seventh and the youngest child, with four brothers and two sisters, all of them much older than him. (Experientially, he grew up an &quot;only child&quot;.) The family lived in two popular districts of Cairo: first, in the Bayt al-Qadi neighborhood in the Gamaleya quarter in the old city, from where they moved in 1924 to Abbaseya, then a new Cairo suburb north of the old city, locations that would provide the backdrop for many of Mahfouz&#x27;s later writings. His father, Abdel-Aziz Ibrahim, whom Mahfouz described as having been &quot;old-fashioned&quot;, was a civil servant, and Mahfouz eventually followed in his footsteps in 1934. Mahfouz&#x27;s mother, Fatimah, was the daughter of Mustafa Qasheesha, an Al-Azhar sheikh, and although illiterate herself, took the boy Mahfouz on numerous excursions to cultural locations such as the Egyptian Museum and the Pyramids.

The Mahfouz family were devout Muslims and Mahfouz had a strict Islamic upbringing. In an interview, he elaborated on the stern religious climate at home during his childhood. He stated, &quot;You would never have thought that an artist would emerge from that family.&quot;

The Egyptian Revolution of 1919 had a strong effect on Mahfouz, although he was at the time only seven years old. From the window he saw British soldiers firing at the demonstrators in an effort to disperse them. According to Mahfouz, &quot;You could say ... that the one thing which most shook the security of my childhood was the 1919 revolution&quot;, he later said.

In his early years, Mahfouz read extensively and was influenced by Hafiz Najib, Taha Hussein and Salama Moussa, the Fabian intellectual.

After completing his secondary education, Mahfouz was admitted in 1930 to the Egyptian University (now Cairo University), where he studied philosophy, graduating in 1934. By 1936, having spent a year working on an M.A. in philosophy, he decided to discontinue his studies and become a professional writer. He published his first work in &quot;Al Majalla Al Jadida&quot;, a magazine started by Salama Musa in 1929. Mahfouz then worked as a journalist for &quot;Arrissalah&quot;, and contributed short stories to &quot;Al-Hilal&quot; and &quot;Al-Ahram&quot;.

== Civil service ==
After receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy from Cairo University in 1934, Mahfouz joined the Egyptian civil service, where he continued to work in various positions and ministries until retirement in 1971. He served first as a clerk at Cairo University, then, in 1938, in the Ministry of Islamic Endowments (Awqaf) as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Islamic Endowments. In 1945, he requested a transfer to the al-Ghuri Mausoleum library, where he interviewed residents of his childhood neighborhood as part of the &quot;Good Loans Project&quot;. In the 1950s, he worked as Director of Censorship in the Bureau of Arts, as Director of the Foundation for the Support of the Cinema, and finally as a consultant to the Ministry of Culture.

== Writing career ==

Mahfouz published 34 novels, over 350 short stories, dozens of screenplays, and five plays over a 70-year career. Possibly his most famous work, &quot;The Cairo Trilogy&quot;, depicts the lives of three generations of different families in Cairo from World War I until after the 1952 military coup that overthrew King Farouk. He was a board member of the publisher &quot;Dar el-Ma&#x27;aref&quot;. Many of his novels were serialized in &quot;Al-Ahram&quot;, and his writings also appeared in his weekly column, &quot;Point of View&quot;. Before the Nobel Prize only a few of his novels had appeared in the West.

=== Writing style and themes ===
Most of Mahfouz&#x27;s early works were set in Cairo. &quot;Abath Al-Aqdar (Mockery of the Fates)&quot; (1939), &quot;Rhadopis&quot; (1943), and &quot;Kifah Tibah (The Struggle of Thebes)&quot; (1944) were historical novels written as part of a larger unfulfilled 30-novel project. Inspired by Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832), Mahfouz planned to cover the entire history of Egypt in a series of books. However, following the third volume, his interest shifted to current settings and issues, as well as the psychological impact of social change on ordinary people.

Mahfouz&#x27;s prose is characterised by the blunt expression of his ideas. His written works cover a broad range of topics, including the controversial and taboo such as socialism, homosexuality, and God. Writing about some of these subjects was prohibited in Egypt.

Mahfouz&#x27;s works often deal with Egypt&#x27;s development during the 20th century, and combined intellectual and cultural influences from both East and West. His own exposure to foreign literature began in his youth with the enthusiastic consumption of Western detective stories, Russian classics, and modernist writers as Marcel Proust, Franz Kafka and James Joyce. Mahfouz&#x27;s stories are almost always set in the heavily populated urban quarters of Cairo, where his characters, usually ordinary people, try to cope with the modernization of society and the temptations of Western values.

Mahfouz&#x27;s central work in the 1950s was the &quot;Cairo Trilogy&quot;, which he completed before the July Revolution. The novels were titled with the street names &quot;Palace Walk&quot;, &quot;Palace of Desire&quot;, and &quot;Sugar Street&quot;. Mahfouz set the story in the parts of Cairo where he grew up. The novels depict the life of the patriarch el-Sayyed Ahmed Abdel Gawad and his family over three generations, from World War I until 1944. Mahfouz stopped writing for some years after finishing the trilogy.

Disappointed in the Nasser régime, which had overthrown the monarchy in 1952, he started publishing again in 1959, now prolifically pouring out novels, short stories, journalism, memoirs, essays, and screenplays. He stated in a 1998 interview that he &quot;long felt that Nasser was one of the greatest political leaders in modern history. I only began to fully appreciate him after he nationalized the Suez Canal.&quot; His non-fiction, including his journalism and essays and his writing on literature and philosophy, were published in four volumes from 2016.

His 1966 novel &quot;Tharthara Fawq Al-Nīl&quot; (Adrift on the Nile) is one of his most popular works. It was later made into a film called &quot;Chitchat on the Nile&quot; during the régime of Anwar al-Sadat. The story criticizes the decadence of Egyptian society during the Nasser era. It was banned by Sadat to avoid provoking Egyptians who still loved former president Nasser. Copies of the banned book were hard to find prior to the late 1990s.

The &quot;Children of Gebelawi&quot; (1959, also known as &quot;Children of the Alley&quot;), one of Mahfouz&#x27;s best known works, portrayed the patriarch Gebelaawi and his children, average Egyptians living the lives of Cain and Abel, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed. Gebelawi builds a mansion in an oasis in the middle of a barren desert; his estate becomes the scene of a family feud that continues for generations. &quot;Whenever someone is depressed, suffering or humiliated, he points to the mansion at the top of the alley at the end opening out to the desert, and says sadly, &#x27;That is our ancestor&#x27;s house, we are all his children, and we have a right to his property. Why are we starving? What have we done?&#x27;&quot; The book was banned throughout the Arab world except in Lebanon until 2006 when it was first published in Egypt. The work was prohibited because of its alleged blasphemy through the allegorical portrayal of God and the monotheistic Abrahamic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

In the 1960s, Mahfouz further developed the theme that humanity is moving further away from God in his existentialist novels. In &quot;The Thief and the Dogs&quot; (1961) he depicted the fate of a Marxist thief who has been released from prison and plans revenge.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Mahfouz began to construct his novels more freely and often used interior monologues. In &quot;Miramar&quot; (1967) he employed a form of multiple First-person narratives. Four narrators, among them a Socialist and a Nasserite opportunist, represent different political views. In the center of the story is an attractive servant girl. In &quot;Arabian Nights and Days&quot; (1979) and in &quot;The Journey of Ibn Fatouma&quot; (1983) he drew on traditional Arabic narratives as subtexts. &quot;Akhenaten: Dweller in Truth&quot; (1985) deals with conflict between old and new religious truths.

Many of his novels were first published in serialized form, including &quot;Children of Gebelawi&quot; and &quot;Midaq Alley&quot; which was also adapted into a Mexican film starring Salma Hayek called &quot;El callejón de los milagros&quot;.

=== Political influence ===
Most of Mahfouz&#x27;s writings deal mainly with politics, a fact he acknowledged: &quot;In all my writings, you will find politics. You may find a story which ignores love or any other subject, but not politics; it is the very axis of our thinking&quot;.

He espoused Egyptian nationalism in many of his works, and expressed sympathies for the post-World-War-era Wafd Party. He was also attracted to socialist and democratic ideals early in his youth. The influence of socialist ideals is strongly reflected in his first two novels, &quot;Al-Khalili&quot; and &quot;New Cairo&quot;, as well as many of his later works. Parallel to his sympathy for socialism and democracy was his antipathy towards Islamic extremism.

In his youth, Mahfouz had personally known Sayyid Qutb when Qutb was showing a greater interest in literary criticism than in Islamic fundamentalism; Qutb later became a significant influence on the Muslim Brotherhood. In the mid-1940s, Qutb was one of the first critics to recognize Mahfouz&#x27;s talent, and by the 1960s, near the end of Qutb&#x27;s life, Mahfouz even visited him in the hospital. But later, in the semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Mirrors&quot;, Mahfouz drew a negative portrait of Qutb. He was disillusioned with the 1952 revolution and by Egypt&#x27;s defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War. He had supported the principles of the revolution, but became disenchanted, saying that the practices failed to live up to the original ideals.

Mahfouz&#x27;s writing influenced a new generation of Egyptian lawyers, including Nabil Mounir and Reda Aslan.

=== Reception ===
Mahfouz&#x27;s translated works received praise from American critics:

&quot;The alleys, the houses, the palaces and mosques and the people who live among them are evoked as vividly in Mahfouz&#x27;s work as the streets of London were conjured by Dickens.&quot;
—&quot;Newsweek&quot;

&quot;Throughout Naguib Mahfouz&#x27;s fiction there is a pervasive sense of metaphor, of a literary artist who is using his fiction to speak directly and unequivocally to the condition of his country. His work is imbued with love for Egypt and its people, but it is also utterly honest and unsentimental.&quot;
—&quot;Washington Post&quot;

&quot;Mahfouz&#x27;s work is freshly nuanced and hauntingly lyrical. The Nobel Prize acknowledges the universal significance of [his] fiction.&quot;
—&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;

&quot;Mr. Mahfouz embodied the essence of what makes the bruising, raucous, chaotic human anthill of Cairo possible.&quot;
—&quot;The Economist&quot;

==== Nobel Prize for Literature ====
Mahfouz was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature, the only Arab writer to have won the award. Shortly after winning the prize Mahfouz was quoted as saying:
The Swedish letter to Mahfouz praised his &quot;rich and complex work&quot;:

Because Mahfouz found traveling to Sweden difficult at his age, he did not attend the award ceremony.

=== Political involvement ===
Mahfouz did not shrink from controversy outside of his work. As a consequence of his support for Sadat&#x27;s Camp David peace treaty with Israel in 1978, his books were banned in many Arab countries until after he won the Nobel Prize. Like many Egyptian writers and intellectuals, Mahfouz was on an Islamic fundamentalist &quot;death list&quot;.

He defended British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini condemned Rushdie to death in a 1989 fatwa, but also criticized Rushdie&#x27;s novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; as &quot;insulting&quot; to Islam. Mahfouz believed in freedom of expression, and, although he did not personally agree with Rushdie&#x27;s work, he spoke out against the &quot;fatwa&quot; condemning him to death for it.

In 1989, after Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s &quot;fatwa&quot; calling for Rushdie and his publishers to be killed, Mahfouz called Khomeini a terrorist. Shortly after, Mahfouz joined 80 other intellectuals in declaring that &quot;no blasphemy harms Islam and Muslims so much as the call for murdering a writer.&quot;

== Assassination attempt and aftermath ==
The publication of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; revived the controversy surrounding Mahfouz&#x27;s novel &quot;Children of Gebelawi&quot;. Death threats against Mahfouz followed, including one from the &quot;blind sheikh&quot;, Egyptian-born Omar Abdel-Rahman. Mahfouz was given police protection, but in 1994 an extremist succeeded in attacking the 82-year-old novelist by stabbing him in the neck outside his Cairo home.

He survived, permanently affected by damage to nerves of his right upper limb. Sixteen people were put on a military trial, and two of them received death penalty and eventually hanged. After the incident, Mahfouz was unable to write for more than a few minutes a day and consequently produced fewer and fewer works. Subsequently, he lived under constant bodyguard protection. Finally, in the beginning of 2006, the novel was published in Egypt with a preface written by Ahmad Kamal Aboul-Magd. After the threats, Mahfouz stayed in Cairo with his lawyer, Nabil Mounir Habib. Mahfouz and Mounir would spend most of their time in Mounir&#x27;s office; Mahfouz used Mounir&#x27;s library as a reference for most of his books. Mahfouz stayed with Mounir until his death.

==Personal life==
Mahfouz remained a bachelor until age 43 because he believed that, with its numerous restrictions and limitations, marriage would hamper his literary future. &quot;I was afraid of marriage . . . especially when I saw how busy my brothers and sisters were with social events because of it. This one went to visit people, that one invited people. I had the impression that married life would take up all my time. I saw myself drowning in visits and parties. No freedom.&quot;

However, in 1954, he quietly married a Coptic Orthodox woman from Alexandria, Atiyyatallah Ibrahim, with whom he had two daughters, Fatima and Umm Kalthum. The couple initially lived on a houseboat in the Agouza section of Cairo on the west bank of the Nile, then moved to an apartment along the river in the same area. Mahfouz avoided public exposure, especially inquiries into his private life, which might have become, as he put it, &quot;a silly topic in journals and radio programs.&quot;

Mahfouz distinctly did not like to travel. Belgrade was one of the few cities to which he gladly went and he expressed great respect for Serbia.

== Legacy ==
Mahfouz&#x27;s legacy is considered a cornerstone of Modern Egyptian culture, his books are republished all the time, Cairo International Book Fair celebrated Mahfouz more than once. 

His books keeps getting adapted into films and TV series in Egypt or internationally, such as Mexican adaptation of Midaq Alley starring Salma Hayek in 1995, and Egyptian TV series Afrah AlQoba, Bayn El Samaa Wa El Ard and Hadith Alsabah wa Almassaa among others. 

In 2019, Egyptian Ministry of Culture opened Naguib Mahfouz museum located in Old Cairo, near Wikala of al-Ghuri, Muzz Street and Azhar mosque, where most of Mahfouz novels take place, the museum have different collectibles from Mahfouz&#x27;s life such as his hat, desk, photographs and his awards including Nobel Medal.

In 2021, Egyptian actor Ahmed Helmy announced that he&#x27;s working on a biographical TV series about Mahfouz&#x27;s life, Starring Helmy as Mahfouz and written by Abdelreheem Kamal.

<text>The nomenklatura (; from , system of names) were a category of people within the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries who held various key administrative positions in the bureaucracy, running all spheres of those countries&#x27; activity: government, industry, agriculture, education, etc., whose positions were granted only with approval by the communist party of each country or region. While in Russian language the term has the same generic meaning as &quot;nomenclature&quot;, in the context of the politics of the Soviet Union it refers to the &quot;party and state nomenklatura&quot;, lists of persons vetted for key management, or &quot;nomenklatura lists&quot;.

== Description ==

Virtually all members of the nomenklatura were members of a communist party. Critics of Stalin, such as Milovan Djilas, critically defined them as a &quot;new class&quot;. Richard Pipes, a Harvard historian, claimed that the nomenklatura system mainly reflected a continuation of the old Tsarist regime, as many former Tsarist officials or &quot;careerists&quot; joined the Bolshevik government during and after the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922.

The &quot;nomenklatura&quot; formed a &quot;de facto&quot; elite of public powers in the former Eastern Bloc; one may compare them to the Western &quot;establishment&quot; holding or controlling both private and public powers (for example, in media, finance, trade, industry, the state and institutions).

Individuals with a nomenklatura background have continued to dominate economic and political life in Russia since the end of the Cold War. According to one 2022 estimate, 60% of elites in the Vladimir Putin regime had nomenklatura backgrounds.

The nomenklatura referred to the Communist Party&#x27;s governance to make appointments to key positions throughout the governmental system, as well as throughout the party&#x27;s own hierarchy. Specifically, the nomenklatura consisted of two separate lists: one was for key positions, appointments to which were made by authorities within the party; the other was for persons who were potential candidates for appointment to those positions. The Politburo, as part of its nomenklatura authority, maintained a list of ministerial and ambassadorial positions that it had the power to fill, as well as a separate list of potential candidates to occupy those positions.

The nomenklatura system arose early in Soviet history. Vladimir Lenin wrote that appointments were to take the following criteria into account: reliability, political attitude, qualifications, and administrative ability. Joseph Stalin, who was the first general secretary of the party, was also known as &quot;Comrade File Cabinet&quot; (Tovarishch Kartotekov) for his assiduous attention to the details of the party&#x27;s appointments. Seeking to make appointments in a more systematic fashion, Stalin built the party&#x27;s patronage system and used it to distribute his clients throughout the party bureaucracy.

In 1922, Lenin allied with Leon Trotsky against the party&#x27;s growing bureaucratisation and the influence of Joseph Stalin. Under Stalin&#x27;s direction in 1922, the party created departments of the Central Committee and other organs at lower levels that were responsible for the registration and appointment of party officials. Known as uchraspred, these organs supervised appointments to important party posts. According to American Sovietologist Seweryn Bialer, after Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s accession to power in October 1964, the party considerably expanded its appointment authority. However, in the late 1980s, some official statements indicated that the party intended to reduce its appointment authority, particularly in the area of economic management, in line with Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reform efforts.

At the all-union level, the Party Building and Cadre Work Department supervised party nomenklatura appointments. This department maintained records on party members throughout the country, made appointments to positions on the all-union level, and approved nomenklatura appointments on the lower levels of the hierarchy. The head of this department sometimes was a member of the Secretariat and was often a protégé of the general secretary.

Every party committee and party organizational department, from the all-union level in Moscow to the district and city levels, prepared two lists according to their needs. The basic list (&quot;osnovnoi spisok&quot;) detailed positions in the political, administrative, economic, military, cultural, and educational bureaucracies that the committee and its department had responsibility for filling. The registration list (&quot;uchetnyi spicok&quot;) enumerated the persons suitable for these positions.

== &quot;The New Class&quot; ==
Yugoslav politician Milovan Đilas, a critic of Stalin, wrote of the nomenklatura as the &quot;new class&quot; in his book &quot;The New Class: An Analysis of the Communist System&quot;, and he claimed that it was seen by ordinary citizens as a bureaucratic elite that enjoyed special privileges and had supplanted the earlier wealthy capitalist elites.

== China&#x27;s nomenklatura ==

China adopted the &quot;nomenklatura&quot; system from the Soviet Union in the 1960s and is still using this system of governance to this day. According to scholar Hon Chan, it establishes China&#x27;s &quot;party and governmental leadership&quot; and is a &quot;key instrument of Communist Party control.&quot; For China, it is not just the party that &quot;nomenklatura&quot; has control over but &quot;the government, judicial system, schools, and universities, enterprises, research establishments, religious organizations, museums, libraries, hospitals&quot; are all things that fall under the domain as well. Despite there being &quot;elected&quot; officials, &quot;&quot;all&quot; positions of real importance fall under the CCP’s &quot;nomenklatura&quot;.&quot; The cadres higher up on the political ladder were able to control those under them. One scholar who has done in depth research on China&#x27;s Nomenklatura is named John Burns. He highlights the different classes inside the party. Level &quot;A&quot; is the highest level of cadres, including heads of party central departments. Level &quot;B&quot; consisted of the lesser ranked officials. In 1983 a plan was presented to decentralize the control that personnel management had. The authorities suggested to halve the number of cadres from 13,000 to 7,000. The Central Committee, who previously had control over the majority of posts, was drastically reduced in its areas of management. It had previously controlled all high-level appointments and ensured party control over critical positions in government. The aim of this reform was to redistribute power to the lower levels and to make personnel management more efficient. Since 1984, the Central Committee&#x27;s control over appointments has been divided into two lists:

# The &quot;Job Title List of Cadres Managed by the Party Central Committee,&quot; including about 5,000 senior positions requiring Central Committee approval for appointments and removals.
# The &quot;List of Cadre Positions to be Reported to the Party Central Committee,&quot; including tens of thousands of slightly lower-level positions that must be reported to the Central Committee.

<doc id="22000" wikidata="Q1165650" url="?curid=22000" title="Neural Darwinism">
<text>Neural Darwinism is a biological, and more specifically Darwinian and selectionist, approach to understanding global brain function, originally proposed by American biologist, researcher and Nobel-Prize recipient Gerald Maurice Edelman (July 1, 1929 – May 17, 2014). Edelman&#x27;s 1987 book &quot;Neural Darwinism&quot; introduced the public to the &quot;theory of neuronal group selection&quot; (TNGS), a theory that attempts to explain global brain function.

TNGS (also referred to as the &quot;theory of neural Darwinism&quot;) has roots going back to Edelman and Mountcastle&#x27;s 1978 book, &quot;The Mindful Brain – Cortical Organization and the Group-selective Theory of Higher Brain Function,&quot; which describes the columnar structure of the cortical groups within the neocortex, and argues for selective processes operating among degenerate primary repertoires of neuronal groups. The development of neural Darwinism was deeply influenced by work in the fields of immunology, embryology, and neuroscience, as well as Edelman&#x27;s methodological commitment to the idea of selection as the unifying foundation of the biological sciences.

== Introduction to neural Darwinism ==

Neural Darwinism is really the neural part of the natural philosophical and explanatory framework Edelman employs for much of his work – Somatic selective systems. Neural Darwinism is the backdrop for a comprehensive set of biological hypotheses and theories Edelman, and his team, devised that seek to reconcile vertebrate and mammalian neural morphology, the facts of developmental and evolutionary biology, and the theory of natural selection into a detailed model of real-time neural and cognitive function that is biological in its orientation. It is built from the bottom-up utilizing the variation that shows up in nature. This is in contrast to computational and algorithmic approaches that view variation as noise in a system of logic circuits with point-to-point connectivity.

The book, &quot;Neural Darwinism – The Theory of Neuronal Group Selection&quot; (1987), is the first in a trilogy of books that Edelman wrote to delineate the scope and breadth of his ideas on how a biological theory of consciousness and animal body plan evolution could be developed in a bottom-up fashion. In accordance with principles of population biology and Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection – as opposed to the top-down algorithmic and computational approaches that dominated a nascent cognitive psychology at the time.

The other two volumes are &quot;Topobiology – An Introduction to Molecular Embryology&quot; (1988) with its morpho-regulatory hypothesis of animal body plan development and evolutionary diversification via differential expression of cell surface molecules during development; and &quot;The Remembered Present – A Biological Theory of Consciousness&quot; (1989) – a novel biological approach to understanding the role and function of &quot;consciousness&quot; and its relation to cognition and behavioral physiology.

Edelman would write four more books for the general lay public, explaining his ideas surrounding how the brain works and consciousness arises from the physical organization of the brain and body – &quot;Bright Air, Brilliant Fire – On the Matter of the Mind&quot; (1992), &quot;A Universe of Consciousness – How Matter Becomes Imagination&quot; (2000) with Giulio Tononi, &quot;Wider Than The Sky – The Phenomenal Gift of Consciousness&quot; (2004), and &quot;Second Nature – Brain Science and Human Knowledge&quot; (2006).

Neural Darwinism is an exploration of biological thought and philosophy as well as fundamental science; Edelman being well-versed in the history of science, natural philosophy &amp; medicine, as well as robotics, cybernetics, computing &amp; artificial intelligence. In the course of laying out the case for neural Darwinism, or more properly TNGS, Edelman delineates a set of concepts for rethinking the problem of nervous system organization and function – all-the-while, demanding a rigorously scientific criteria for building the foundation of a properly Darwinian, and therefore biological, explanation of neural function, perception, cognition, and global brain function capable of supporting primary and higher-order consciousness.

== Population thinking – somatic selective systems ==
Edelman was inspired by the successes of fellow Nobel laureate Frank MacFarlane Burnet and his clonal selection theory (CST) of acquired antigen immunity by differential amplification of pre-existing variation within the finite pool of lymphocytes in the immune system. The population of variant lymphocytes within the body mirrored the variant populations of organisms in the ecology. Pre-existing diversity is the engine of adaption in the evolution of populations.

&quot;It is clear from both evolutionary and immunological theory that in facing an unknown future, the fundamental requirement for successful adaption is preexisting diversity&quot;. – Gerald M. Edelman (1978)

Edelman recognizes the explanatory range of Burnet&#x27;s utilization of Darwinian principles in describing the operations of the immune system - and, generalizes the process to all cell populations of the organism. He also comes to view the problem as one of recognition and memory from a biological perspective, where the distinction and preservation of self vs. non-self is vital to organismal integrity.

Neural Darwinism, as TNGS, is a theory of neuronal group selection that retools the fundamental concepts of Darwin and Burnet&#x27;s theoretical approach. Neural Darwinism describes the development and evolution of the mammalian brain and its functioning by extending the Darwinian paradigm into the body and nervous system.

=== Antibodies and NCAM – the emerging understanding of somatic selective systems ===

Edelman was a medical researcher, physical chemist, immunologist, and aspiring neuroscientist when he was awarded the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (shared with Rodney Porter of Great Britain). Edelman&#x27;s part of the prize was for his work revealing the chemical structure of the vertebrate antibody by cleaving the covalent disulfide bridges that join the component chain fragments together, revealing a pair of two-domain light chains and four-domain heavy chains. Subsequent analysis revealed the terminal domains of both chains to be variable domains responsible for antigen recognition.

The work of Porter and Edelman revealed the molecular and genetic foundations underpinning how antibody diversity was generated within the immune system. Their work supported earlier ideas about pre-existing diversity in the immune system put forward by the pioneering Danish immunologist Niels K. Jerne (December 23, 1911 – October 7, 1994); as well as supporting the work of Frank MacFarlane Burnet describing how lymphocytes capable of binding to specific foreign antigens are differentially amplified by clonal multiplication of the selected preexisting variants following antigen discovery.

Edelman would draw inspiration from the mechano-chemical aspects of antigen/antibody/lymphocyte interaction in relation to recognition of self-nonself; the degenerate population of lymphocytes in their physiological context; and the bio-theoretical foundations of this work in Darwinian terms.

By 1974, Edelman felt that immunology was firmly established on solid theoretical grounds descriptively, was ready for quantitative experimentation, and could be an ideal model for exploring evolutionary selection processes within an observable time period.

His studies of immune system interactions developed in him an awareness of the importance of the cell surface and the membrane-embedded molecular mechanisms of interactions with other cells and substrates. Edelman would go on to develop his ideas of topobiology around these mechanisms – and, their genetic and epigenetic regulation under the environmental conditions.

During a foray into molecular embryology and neuroscience, in 1975, Edelman and his team went on to isolate the first neural cell-adhesion molecule (N-CAM), one of the many molecules that hold the animal nervous system together. N-CAM turned out to be an important molecule in guiding the development and differentiation of neuronal groups in the nervous system and brain during embryogenesis. To the amazement of Edelman, genetic sequencing revealed that N-CAM was the ancestor of the vertebrate antibody produced in the aftermath of a set of whole genome duplication events at the origin of vertebrates that gave rise to the entire super-family of immunoglobulin genes.

Edelman reasoned that the N-CAM molecule which is used for self-self recognition and adherence between neurons in the nervous system gave rise to their evolutionary descendants, the antibodies, who evolved self-nonself recognition via antigen-adherence at the origins of the vertebrate antibody-based immune system. If clonal selection was the way the immune system worked, perhaps it was ancestral and more general – and, operating in the embryo and nervous system.

=== Variation in biological systems – degeneracy, complexity, robustness, and evolvability ===


Degeneracy, and its relationship to variation, is a key concept in neural Darwinism. The more we deviate from an ideal form, the more we are tempted to describe the deviations as imperfections. Edelman, on the other hand, explicitly acknowledges the structural and dynamic variability of the nervous system. He likes to contrast the differences between redundancy in an engineered system and degeneracy in a biological system. He proceeds to demonstrate how the &quot;noise&quot; of the computational and algorithmic approach is actually beneficial to a somatic selective system by providing a wide, and degenerate, array of potential recognition elements.

Edelman&#x27;s argument is that in an engineered system,

* a known problem is confronted
* a logical solution is devised
* an artifice is constructed to implement the resolution to the problem

To insure the robustness of the solution, critical components are replicated as exact copies. Redundancy provides a fail-safe backup in the event of catastrophic failure of an essential component but it is the same response to the same problem once the substitution has been made.

If the problem is predictable and known ahead of time, redundancy works optimally. But biological systems face an open and unpredictable arena of spacetime events of which they have no foreknowledge of. In this arena, redundancy fails - a response might be designed to the wrong problem.

Variation fuels degeneracy; degeneracy provides somatic selective systems with more than one way to solve a problem and the propensity to reuse a solution on other problems. This property of degeneracy makes the system more adaptively robust in the face of unforeseen contingencies: When one particular solution fails unexpectedly, there are other unaffected pathways that can be engaged in pursuit of the same end. Early on, Edelman spends considerable time contrasting degeneracy vs. redundancy, bottom-up vs. top-down processes, and selectionist vs. instructionist explanations of biological phenomena.

=== Rejection of computational models, codes, and point-to-point wiring ===

Edelman was well aware of the earlier debate in immunology between the instructionists, who believed the lymphocytes of the immune system learned or was instructed about the antigen and then devised a response; and the selectionists, who believed that the lymphocytes already contained the response to the antigen within the existing population that was differentially amplified within the population upon contact with the antigen. And, he was well aware that the selectionist had the evidence on their side.

Edelman&#x27;s theoretical approach in &quot;Neural Darwinism&quot; was conceived of in opposition to top-down algorithmic, computational, and instructionist approaches to explaining neural function. Edelman seeks to turn the problems of that paradigm to advantage instead; thereby highlighting the difference between bottom-up processes like we see in biology vis a vis top-down processes like we see in engineering algorithms. He sees neurons as living organisms working in cooperative and competitive ways within their local ecology and rejects models that see the brain in terms of computer chips or logic gates in an algorithmically organized machine.

Edelman&#x27;s commitment to the Darwinian underpinnings of biology, his emerging understanding of the evolutionary relationships between the two molecules he had worked with, and his background in immunology lead him to become increasingly critical and dissatisfied with attempts to describe the operation of the nervous system and brain in computational or algorithmic terms.

Edelman explicitly rejects computational approaches to explaining biology as non-biological. Edelman acknowledges that there is a conservation of phylogenetic organization and structure within the vertebrate nervous system, but also points out that locally natural diversity, variation and degeneracy abound. This variation within the nervous system is disruptive for theories based upon strict point-to-point connectivity, computation, or logical circuits based upon codes. Attempts to understand this &quot;noise&quot; present difficulties for top-down algorithmic approaches – and, deny the fundamental facts of the &quot;biological&quot; nature of the problem.

Edelman perceived that the problematic and annoying noise of the computational circuit-logic paradigm could be reinterpreted from a population biology perspective – where that variation in the signal or architecture was actually the engine of ingenuity and robustness from a selectionist perspective.

== Completing Darwin&#x27;s program – the problems of evolutionary and developmental morphology ==

In &quot;Topobiology&quot;, Edelman reflects upon Darwin&#x27;s search for the connections between morphology and embryology in his theory of natural selection. He identifies four unresolved problems in the development and evolution of morphology that Darwin thought important:

* Explaining the finite number of body plans manifested since the Precambrian.
* Explaining large-scale morphological changes over relatively short periods of geological time.
* Understanding body size and the basis of allometry.
* How adaptive fitness can explain selection that leads to emergence of complex body structures.

Later, In &quot;Bright Air, Brilliant Fire&quot;, Edelman describes what he calls Darwin&#x27;s Program for obtaining a complete understanding of the rules of behavior and form in evolutionary biology. He identifies four necessary requirements:

*An account of the effects of heredity on behavior – and behavior, on heredity.
*An account of how selection influences behavior – and, how behavior influences selection.
*An account of how behavior is enabled and constrained by morphology.
*An account of how morphogenesis occurs in development and evolution.

It is important to notice that these requirements are not directly stated in terms of genes, but heredity instead. This is understandable considering that Darwin himself appears to not be directly aware of the importance Mendelian genetics. Things had changed by the early 1900s, the Neodarwinian synthesis had unified the population biology of Mendelian inheritance with Darwinian natural selection. By the 1940s, the theories had been shown to be mutually consistent and coherent with paleontology and comparative morphology. The theory came to be known as the &quot;modern synthesis&quot; on the basis of the title of the 1942 book &quot;Evolution: The Modern Synthesis&quot; by Julian Huxley.

The modern synthesis really took off with the discovery of the structural basis of heredity in the form of DNA. The modern synthesis was greatly accelerated and expanded with the rise of the genomic sciences, molecular biology, as well as, advances in computational techniques and the power to model population dynamics. But, for evolutionary-developmental biologists, there was something very important missing... – and, that was the incorporation of one of the founding branches of biology, embryology. A clear understanding of the pathway from germ to zygote to embryo to juvenile and adult was the missing component of the synthesis. Edelman, and his team, were positioned in time and space to fully capitalize on these technical developments and scientific challenges – as his research progressed deeper and deeper into the cellular and molecular underpinnings of the neurophysiological aspects of behavior and cognition from a Darwinian perspective.

Edelman reinterprets the goals of &quot;Darwin&#x27;s program&quot; in terms of the modern understanding about genes, molecular biology, and other sciences that weren&#x27;t available to Darwin. One of his goals is reconciling the relationships between genes in a population (genome) which lie in the germ line (sperm, egg, and fertilized egg); and the individuals in a population who develop degenerate phenotypes (soma) as they transform from an embryo into an adult who will eventually procreate if adaptive. Selection acts on phenotypes (soma), but evolution occurs within the species genome (germ).

Edelman follows the work of the highly influential American geneticist and evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin (March 29, 1929 – July 4, 2021), drawing particular inspiration from his 1974 book, &quot;The Genetic Basis of Evolutionary Change&quot;. Edelman, like Lewontin, seeks a complete description of the transformations (T) that take us from:

* Genome-germ (zygotes) – the paternal and maternal gene contributions are recombined in the fertilized egg, along with the maternal endowment of proteins, and mRNAs, and other developmental components, but the individuals newly formed diploid genetic complement is not in control of the zygote yet; it needs to be activated, or bootstrapped, into the zygotes ongoing maternally-inherited metabolism and physiology. Shortly after recombination the zygote proceeds through transformation (T1) to the point where genetic control of the zygote has been handed off to the individual,
* Phenotype-soma (embryo) – the embryo, which transforms (T2) according to the rules that govern the relationship between the genes, cellular behavior, and the epigenetic contingencies of nature, into
* Phenotype-soma (adult) – an adult, who procreates (T3) with another individual to bring together a new genetic recombination by each introducing a gamete in the form of 
* Genome-germ (gametes) – sperm and egg, which contain the haploid genetic contribution of each parent which is transformed (T4)...
* Genome-germ (zygotes) -into a diploid set genes in a fertilized egg, soon to be a newly individual zygote .

Lewontin&#x27;s exploration of these transformations between genomic and phenotypic spaces was in terms of key selection pressures that sculpt the organism over geological evolutionary time scales; but, Edelmans approach is more mechanical, and in the here and now – focusing on the genetically constrained mechano-chemistry of the selection processes that guide epigenetic behaviors on the part of cells within the embryo and adult over developmental time.

Edelman&#x27;s isolation of NCAM lead him to theorize on the role of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and substrate adhesion molecules (SAMs) in the formation of the animal bodyplan in both realtime and over evolutionary time. Topobiology is primarily dedicated to this issue that is foundational to the understanding of neural Darwinism and the formation of the primary repertoire of TNGS.

In his &quot;regulator hypothesis&quot;, Edelman hypothesizes about the role of cell surface molecules in embryogenesis and how shifting expression of these molecules in time and place within the embryo can guide the development of pattern. Later, he will expand the hypothesis into the &quot;morpho-regulatory hypothesis.&quot; He describes the embryonic cell populations as either organized as mesenchyme or epetheilia.

Edelman characterizes the two population types as follows:

* Epithelia – a population of cells that are organized into coherent tissues, that have well established CAM patterns; as well as a stable pattern of substrate adhesion between the cells and the extracellular matrix.
* Mesenchyme – a population of cells that are loosely associated and migratory, that have retracted (or localized) their CAM and SAM molecules such that they can follow homophilic and heterophilic gradients within other cell populations of the embryo.

He envisages a CAM, and SAM, driven cycle where cell populations transform back and forth between mesenchyme and epithelia via epithelial-mesenchymal transformations, as the development of the embryo proceeds through to the fetal stage. The expression of the CAMs and SAMs is under genetic control, but the distribution of these molecules on the cell membrane and extracellular matrix is historically contingent upon epigenetic events, serving as one of the primary bases for generating pre-existing diversity within the nervous system and other tissues.

=== The developmental genetic question ===

There are many developmental questions to be considered, but Edelman is able to succinctly summarize the problem in a way that will show a clear explanatory path forward for him. The &quot;developmental genetic question&quot; defines the problem – and, the theoretical approach for him.

&quot;How does a one-dimensional genetic code specify a three-dimensional animal?&quot; – Gerald M. Edelman, from the glossary of &quot;Topobiology&quot;

By 1984, Edelman would be ready to answer this question and combine it with his earlier ideas on degeneracy and somatic selection in the nervous system. Edelman would revisit this issue in &quot;Topobiology&quot; and combine it with an evolutionary approach, seeking a comprehensive theory of body plan formation and evolution.

=== The regulator hypothesis ===

In 1984, Edelman published his &quot;regulator hypothesis&quot; of CAM and SAM action in the development and evolution of the animal body plan.

Edelman would reiterate this hypothesis in his &quot;Neural Darwinism&quot; book in support of the mechanisms for degenerate neuronal group formation in the primary repertoire. The regulator hypothesis was primarily concerned with the action of CAMs. He would later expand the hypothesis in &quot;Topobiology&quot; to include a much more diverse and inclusive set of morphoregulatory molecules.

=== The evolutionary question ===

Edelman realized that in order to truly complete Darwin&#x27;s program, he would need to link the developmental question to the larger issues of evolutionary biology.

&quot;How is an answer to the developmental genetic question (q.v.) reconciled with the relatively rapid changes in form occurring in relatively short evolutionary times?&quot; – Gerald M. Edelman, from the glossary of &quot;Topobiology&quot;

=== The morphoregulator hypothesis ===

Shortly after publishing his &quot;regulator hypothesis&quot;, Edelman expanded his vision of pattern formation during embryogenesis - and, sought to link it to a broader evolutionary framework. His first and foremost goal is to answer the &quot;developmental genetic question&quot; followed by the &quot;evolutionary question&quot; in a clear, consistent, and coherent manner.

== TNGS – the theory of neuronal group selection ==

Edelman&#x27;s motivation for developing the theory of neuronal group selection (TNGS) was to resolve &quot;a number of apparent inconsistencies in our knowledge of the development, anatomy, and physiological function of the central nervous system.&quot; A pressing issue for Edelman was explaining perceptual categorization without reference to a central observing &quot;homunculus&quot; or &quot;assuming that the world is prearranged in an informational fashion.&quot;

To free himself of the demands, requirements, and contradictions of information processing model; Edelman proposes that perceptual categorization operates by the selection of neuronal groups organized into variant networks that are differentially amplified of their responses in conjunction with hedonic feedback over the course of experience, from within a massive population of neuronal groups being confronted by a chaotic array of sensory input of differing degrees of significance and relevance to the organism.

Edelman outright rejects the notion of a &quot;homunculus&quot;, describing it as a &quot;close cousin of the developmental electrician and the neural decoder&quot;, artifacts of the observer-centralized top-down design logic of information processing approaches. Edelman properly points out that &quot;it is probably a safe guess that most neurobiologists would view the homunculus as well as dualist solutions (Popper and Eccles 1981) to the problems of subjective report as being beyond scientific consideration.&quot;

=== Necessary criteria for a selectionist theory of higher brain function ===

Edelman&#x27;s first theoretical contribution to neural Darwinism came in 1978, when he proposed his &quot;group selection and phasic reentrant signalling&quot;. Edelman lays out five necessary requirements that a biological theory of higher brain function must satisfy.

* The theory should be consistent with the fields of embryology, neuroanatomy, and neurophysiology.
* The theory should account for learning and memory, and temporal recall in a distributed system.
* The theory should account how memory is updated on the basis of realtime experience.
* The theory should account for how higher brain systems mediate experience and action.
* The theory should account for the necessary, if not sufficient, conditions for the emergence of awareness.

=== Organization of the TNGS theory ===

&quot;Neural Darwinism&quot; organizes the explanation of TNGS into three parts – somatic selection, epigenetic mechanisms, and global functions. The first two parts are concerned with how variation emerges through the interaction of genetic and epigenetic events at the cellular level in response to events occurring at the level of the developing animal nervous system. The third part attempts to build a temporally coherent model of globally unitary cognitive function and behavior that emerges from the bottom up through the interactions of the neuronal groups in real-time.

Edelman organized key ideas of the TNGS theory into three main tenets:

*Primary repertoire – developmental formation and selection of neuronal groups;
*Secondary repertoire – behavioral and experiential selection leading to changes in the strength of connections between synaptic populations that bind together neuronal groups;
*Reentrant signaling – the synchronous entrainment of reciprocally connected neuronal groups within sensorimotor maps into ensembles of coherent global activity.

The primary repertoire is formed during the period from the beginning of neurulation to the end of apoptosis. The secondary repertoire extends over the period synaptogenesis and myelination, but will continue to demonstrate developmental plasticity throughout life, albeit in a diminished fashion compared to early development.

The two repertoires deal with the issue of the relationship between genetic and epigenetic processes in determining the overall architecture of the neuroanatomy – seeking to reconcile nature, nurture, and variability in the forming the final phenotype of any individual nervous system.
There is no point-to-point wiring that carries a neural code through a computational logic circuit that delivers the result to the brain because

* firstly, the evidence does not lend support to such notion in a manner that is not problematic,
* secondly, the noise in the system is too great for a neural code to be coherent,
* and third, the genes can only contribute to, and constrain, developmental processes; not determine them in all their details.

Variation is the inevitable outcome of developmental dynamics.

Reentrant signalling is an attempt to explain how &quot;coherent temporal correlations of the responses of sensory receptor sheets, motor ensembles, and interacting neuronal groups in different brain regions occur&quot;.

==== Primary repertoire- developmental selection ====

The first tenet of TNGS concerns events that are embryonic and run up to the neonatal period. This part of the theory attempts to account for the unique anatomical diversification of the brain even between genetically identical individuals. The first tenet proposes the development of a primary repertoire of degenerate neuronal groups with diverse anatomical connections are established via the historical contingencies of the primary processes of development. It seeks to provide an explanation of how the diversity of neuronal group phenotypes emerge from the organism&#x27;s genotype via genetic and epigenetic influences that manifest themselves mechano-chemically at the cell surface and determine connectivity.

Edelman list the following as vital to the formation of the primary repertoire of neuronal groups but, also contributing to their anatomical diversification and variation:

* Cell division – there are repeated rounds of cell division in the formation of neuronal populations
* Cell death – there is extensive amounts of pre-programmed cell death that occurs via apoptosis within the neuronal populations.
* Process extension and elimination – the exploratory probing of the embryonic environment by developing neurons involve process extension and elimination as the neurons detect molecular gradients on neighboring cell surface membranes and the substrate of the extracellular matrix.
* CAM &amp; SAM action – the mechanochemistry of cell and surface adhesion molecules plays a key role in the migration and connectivity of neurons as they form neuronal groups within the overall distributed population.

Two key questions with respect to this issue that Edelman is seeking to answer &quot;in terms of developmental genetic and epigenetic events&quot; are:

* &quot;How does a one-dimensional genetic code specify a three-dimensional animal?&quot;
* &quot;How is the answer to this question consistent with the possibility of relatively rapid morphological change in relatively short periods of evolutionary time?&quot;

==== Secondary repertoire – experiential selection ====

The second tenet of TNGS regards postnatal events that govern the development of a secondary repertoire of synaptic connectivity between higher-order populations of neuronal groups whose formation is driven by behavioral or experiential selection acting on synaptic populations within and between neuronal groups. Edelman&#x27;s notion of the secondary repertoire heavily borrows from work of Jean-Pierre Changeux, and his associates Philippe Courrège and Antoine Danchin – and, their theory of selective stabilization of synapses.

===== Synaptic modification =====

Once the basic variegated anatomical structure of the primary repertoire of neuronal groups is laid down, it is more or less fixed. But given the numerous and diverse collection of neuronal group networks, there are bound to be functionally equivalent albeit anatomically non-isomorphic neuronal groups and networks capable of responding to certain sensory input. This creates a competitive environment where neuronal groups proficient in their responses to certain inputs are &quot;differentially amplified&quot; through the enhancement of the synaptic efficacies of the selected neuronal group network. This leads to an increased probability that the same network will respond to similar or identical signals at a future time. This occurs through the strengthening of neuron-to-neuron synapses. These adjustments allow for neural plasticity along a fairly quick timetable.

==== Reentry ====
The third, and final, tenet of TNGS is reentry. Reentrant signalling &quot;is based on the existence of reciprocally connected neural maps.&quot; These topobiological maps maintain and coordinate the real-time responses of multiple responding secondary repertoire networks, both unimodal and multimodal – and their reciprocal reentrant connections allow them to &quot;maintain and sustain the spatiotemporal continuity in response to real-world signals.&quot;

The last part of the theory attempts to explain how we experience spatiotemporal consistency in our interaction with environmental stimuli. Edelman called it &quot;reentry&quot; and proposes a model of reentrant signaling whereby a disjunctive, multimodal sampling of the same stimulus event correlated in time that make possible sustained physiological entrainment of distributed neuronal groups into temporally stable global behavioral units of action or perception. Put another way, multiple neuronal groups can be used to sample a given stimulus set in parallel and communicate between these disjunctive groups with incurred latency.

== The extended theory of neuronal group selection – the dynamic core hypothesis ==

In the aftermath of his publication of &quot;Neural Darwinism&quot;, Edelman continued to develop and extend his TNGS theory as well as his regulator hypothesis. Edelman would deal with the morphological issues in &quot;Topobiology&quot; and begin to extend the TNGS theory in &quot;The Remembered Present&quot;. Periodically over the intervening years, Edelman would release a new update on his theory and the progress made.

In &quot;The Remembered Present&quot;, Edelman would observe that the mammalian central nervous system seemed to have two distinct morphologically organized systems – one the limbic-brain stem system which is primarily dedicated to &quot;appetitive, consumatory, and defensive behavior&quot;; The other system is the highly reentrant thalamocortical system, consisting of the thalamus along with the &quot;primary and secondary sensory areas and association cortex&quot; which are &quot;linked strongly to exteroceptors and is closely and extensively mapped in a polymodal fashion.&quot;

=== The limbic-brain stem system – the interior world of signals ===

The neural anatomy of the hedonic feedback system resides in the brain stem, autonomic, endocrine, and limbic systems. This system communicates its evaluation of the visceral state to the rest of the central nervous system. Edelman calls this system the &quot;limbic-brain stem system&quot;.

=== The thalamocortical system - the exterior world of signals ===

The thalamus is the gateway to the neocortex for all senses except olfactory. The spinothalamic tracts bring sensory information from the periphery to the thalamus, where multimodal sensory information is integrated and triggers the fast response subcortical reflexive motor responses via the amygdala, basal ganglia, hypothalamus and brainstem centers. Simultaneously, each sensory modality is also being sent to the cortex in parallel, for higher-order reflective analysis, multimodal sensorimotor association, and the engagement of the slow modulatory response that will fine-tune the subcortical reflexes.

=== The cortical appendages – the organs of succession ===

In &quot;The Remembered Present&quot;, Edelman acknowledges the limits of his TNGS theory to model the temporal succession dynamics of motor behavior and memory. His early attempts at replication automata proved inadequate to the task of explaining the realtime sequencing and integration of the neuronal group interactions with other systems of the organism. &quot;Neither the original theory nor simulated recognition automata deal in satisfactory detail with the successive ordering of events in time mediated by the several major brain components that contribute to memory, particularly as it relates to consciousness.&quot; This problem lead him to focus on what he called the organs of succession; the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and hippocampus.

==Reception==

An early review of the book &quot;Neural Darwinism&quot; in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; by Israel Rosenfield invited a lively response on the part of the neurosciences community. Edelman&#x27;s views would be seen as an attack on the dominant paradigm of computational algorithms in cognitive psychology and computational neuroscience – inviting criticism from many corners.

There would be copious complaints about the language difficulty. Some would see Edelman coming across as arrogant, or an interloper into the field of neuroscience, from neighboring molecular biology. There were legitimate arguments raised as to how much experimental and observational data had been gathered in support of the theory at that time. Or, if the theory was even original or not.

But more often, rather than dealing with Edelman&#x27;s critique of computational approaches, the criticism would be centered around whether Edelman&#x27;s system was a truly proper Darwinian explanation. Nonetheless, &quot;Neural Darwinism&quot;, both the book and the concept, received fairly broad critical acclaim.

One of the most famous critiques of &quot;Neural Darwinism&quot; would be the 1989 critical review by Francis Crick, &quot;Neural Edelmanism&quot;. Francis Crick based his criticism on the basis that neuronal groups are instructed by the environment rather than undergoing blind variation. In 1988, the neurophysiologist William Calvin had proposed true replication in the brain, whereas Edelman opposed the idea of true replicators in the brain. Stephen Smoliar published another review in 1989.

England, and its neuroscience community, would have to rely on bootleg copies of the book until 1990, but once the book arrive on English shores, the British social commentator and neuroscientist Steven Rose was quick to offer both praise and criticism of its ideas, writing style, presumptions and conclusions. The &quot;New York Times&quot; writer George Johnson published &quot;Evolution Between the Ears&quot;, a critical review of Gerald Edelman&#x27;s 1992 book &quot;Brilliant Air, Brilliant Fire&quot;. In 2014, John Horgan wrote a to Gerald Edelman in &quot;Scientific American&quot;, highlighting both his arrogance, brilliance, and idiosyncratic approach to science.

It has been suggested by Chase Herrmann-Pillath that Friedrich Hayek had earlier proposed a similar idea in his book &quot;The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology&quot;, published in 1952. Other leading proponents of a selectionist proposals include Jean-Pierre Changeux (1973, 1985), Daniel Dennett, and Linda B. Smith. Reviews of Edelman&#x27;s work would continue to be published as his ideas spread.

A recent review by Fernando, Szathmary and Husbands explains why Edelman&#x27;s neural Darwinism is not Darwinian because it does not contain units of evolution as defined by John Maynard Smith. It is selectionist in that it satisfies the Price equation, but there is no mechanism in Edelman&#x27;s theory that explains how information can be transferred between neuronal groups. A recent theory called &quot;evolutionary neurodynamics&quot; being developed by Eors Szathmary and Chrisantha Fernando has proposed several means by which true replication may take place in the brain.

These neuronal models have been extended by Fernando in a later paper. In the most recent model, three plasticity mechanisms i) multiplicative STDP, ii) LTD, and iii) Heterosynaptic competition, are responsible for copying of connectivity patterns from one part of the brain to another. Exactly the same plasticity rules can explain experimental data for how infants do causal learning in the experiments conducted by Alison Gopnik. It has also been shown that by adding Hebbian learning to neuronal replicators the power of neuronal evolutionary computation may actually be greater than natural selection in organisms.

<text>Neil Ellwood Peart ( ; September 12, 1952 – January 7, 2020) was a Canadian and American musician, known as the drummer, percussionist, and primary lyricist of the rock band Rush. He was known to fans by the nickname &quot;the Professor&quot;, derived from the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; character of the same name. His drumming was renowned for its technical proficiency and his live performances for their exacting nature and stamina. Peart earned numerous awards for his musical performances, including an induction into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Readers Poll Hall of Fame in 1983 at the age of thirty, making him the youngest person ever so honoured.

Peart was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and grew up in Port Dalhousie (now part of St. Catharines). During adolescence, he floated between regional bands in pursuit of a career as a full-time drummer. After a discouraging stint in England, Peart returned home to concentrate on music where he joined Rush, a Toronto band, in mid-1974, six years after its formation. Together they released 19 studio albums, with 10 exceeding a million copies sold in the United States. &quot;Billboard&quot; lists the band third in &quot;most consecutive gold or platinum albums by a rock band&quot;.

Early in his career, Peart&#x27;s performance style was deeply rooted in hard rock. He drew most of his inspiration from drummers such as Keith Moon, Ginger Baker, and John Bonham, players who at the time were at the forefront of the British hard rock scene. As time passed, he began to emulate jazz and big band musicians Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. In 1994, Peart became a friend and pupil of jazz instructor Freddie Gruber. It was during this time that Peart revamped his playing style by incorporating jazz and swing components.

In addition to serving as Rush&#x27;s primary lyricist, Peart published several memoirs about his travels. His lyrics for Rush addressed universal themes and diverse subjects including science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy, as well as secular, humanitarian, and libertarian themes. Peart wrote a total of seven non-fiction books focused on his travels and personal stories. He also co-authored with Kevin J. Anderson three steampunk fantasy novels based on Rush&#x27;s final album, &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot;. The two also wrote a dark fantasy novella, &quot;Drumbeats&quot;, inspired by Peart&#x27;s travels in Africa.

Peart announced his retirement from touring in an interview with &quot;Drumhead Magazine&quot; in December 2015. In January 2018, bandmate Alex Lifeson confirmed that Rush had disbanded also due to Peart&#x27;s health issues. During his last years Peart lived in Santa Monica, California, with his wife, Carrie Nuttall, and daughter. After a three-and-a-half-year illness, Peart died of glioblastoma on January 7, 2020, at age 67.

==Biography==
===Early childhood===
Peart was born on September 12, 1952, to Glen and Betty Peart and lived his early years on his family&#x27;s farm in Hagersville, Ontario, on the outskirts of Hamilton. The first child of four, his brother Danny and sisters Judy and Nancy were born after the family moved to St. Catharines when Peart was two years old. At this time his father became parts manager for Dalziel Equipment, an International Harvester farm machinery dealer. In 1956 the family moved to the Port Dalhousie area of the town. Peart attended Gracefield School and later Lakeport Secondary School, and described his childhood as happy; he stated he experienced a warm family life. By early adolescence he became interested in music and acquired a transistor radio, which he would use to tune into popular music stations broadcasting from Toronto, Hamilton, Welland, and Buffalo.

Peart&#x27;s first exposure to musical training came in the form of piano lessons; he later said in his instructional video &quot;A Work in Progress&quot; that these lessons did not have much influence on him. He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around the house with a pair of chopsticks, so for his 13th birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum, and some lessons, with the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.

Peart fulfilled his promise and his parents bought him a drum kit for his 14th birthday; furthermore, he began taking lessons from Don George at the Peninsula Conservatory of Music. His stage debut took place that year at the school&#x27;s Christmas pageant in St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church Hall in Port Dalhousie. His next appearance was at Lakeport High School with his first group, The Eternal Triangle. This performance contained an original number titled &quot;LSD Forever&quot;. At this show he performed his first solo.

Peart got a job in Lakeside Park, in Port Dalhousie on the shores of Lake Ontario, which later inspired a song of the same name on the Rush album &quot;Caress of Steel&quot;. He worked on the Bubble Game and Ball Toss, but his tendency to take it easy when business was slack resulted in his termination. By his late teens, Peart had played in local bands such as Mumblin&#x27; Sumpthin&#x27;, and the Majority. These bands practiced in basement recreation rooms and garages and played church halls, high schools, and skating rinks in towns across Southern Ontario such as Mitchell, Seaforth, and Elmira. They also played in the Northern Ontario city of Timmins. Tuesday nights were filled with jam sessions at the Niagara Theatre Centre.

===Early career===
At 18 years old (and after struggling to achieve success as a drummer in Canada), Peart travelled to London, England, hoping to further his career as a professional musician. Despite playing in several bands and picking up occasional session work, he was forced to support himself by selling jewellery at a shop called The Great Frog on Carnaby Street.

While in London, he came across the writings of novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand. Rand&#x27;s writings became a significant early philosophical influence on Peart, as he found many of her writings on individualism and Objectivism inspiring. References to Rand&#x27;s philosophy can be found in his early lyrics, most notably &quot;Anthem&quot; from 1975&#x27;s &quot;Fly by Night&quot; and &quot;2112&quot; from 1976&#x27;s &quot;2112&quot;.

After 18 months, Peart became disillusioned by his lack of progress in the music business; he placed his aspiration of becoming a professional musician on hold and returned to Canada. Upon returning to St. Catharines, he worked for his father selling tractor parts at Dalziel Equipment.

===Joining Rush===
After returning to Canada, Peart was recruited to play drums for a St. Catharines band known as Hush, who played on the Southern Ontario bar circuit. Soon after, a mutual acquaintance convinced Peart to audition for the Toronto-based band Rush, which needed a replacement for its original drummer John Rutsey. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson oversaw the audition. His future bandmates describe his arrival that day as somewhat humorous, as he arrived in shorts, driving a battered old Ford Pinto with his drums stored in trashbags. Peart felt the entire audition was a complete disaster. While Lee and Peart hit it off on a personal level (both sharing similar tastes in books and music), Lifeson had a less favourable impression of Peart.

After some discussion between Lee and Lifeson, Peart officially joined the band on July 29, 1974, two weeks before the group&#x27;s first US tour. Peart procured a silver Slingerland kit which he played at his first gig with the band, opening for Uriah Heep and Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band in front of over 11,000 people at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh on August 14, 1974.

Peart soon settled into his new position, also becoming the band&#x27;s primary lyricist. Before joining Rush he had written a few songs, but, with the other members largely uninterested in writing lyrics, Peart&#x27;s previously underutilised writing became as noticed as his musicianship. The band were working hard to establish themselves as a recording act, and Peart, along with the rest of the band, began to undertake extensive touring.

His first recording with the band, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Fly by Night&quot;, was fairly successful, winning the Juno Award for most promising new act, but the follow-up, &quot;Caress of Steel&quot;, for which the band had high hopes, was greeted with hostility by both fans and critics. In response to this negative reception, most of which was aimed at the B-side-spanning epic &quot;The Fountain of Lamneth&quot;, Peart responded by penning &quot;2112&quot; on their next album of the same name in 1976. The album, despite record company indifference, became their breakthrough and gained a following in the United States. The supporting tour culminated in a three-night stand at Massey Hall in Toronto, a venue Peart had dreamed of playing in his days on the Southern Ontario bar circuit and where he was introduced as &quot;The Professor on the drum kit&quot; by Lee.

Peart returned to England for Rush&#x27;s Northern European Tour and the band stayed in the United Kingdom to record the next album, 1977&#x27;s &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;, in Rockfield Studios in Wales. They returned to Rockfield to record the follow-up, &quot;Hemispheres&quot;, in 1978, which they wrote entirely in the studio. The recording of five studio albums in four years, coupled with as many as 300 gigs a year, convinced the band to take a different approach thereafter. Peart has described his time in the band up to this point as &quot;a dark tunnel&quot;.

===Playing style reinvention===
In 1991, Peart was invited by Buddy Rich&#x27;s daughter, Cathy Rich, to play at the Buddy Rich Memorial Scholarship Concert in New York City. Peart accepted and performed for the first time with the Buddy Rich Big Band. Peart remarked that he had little time to rehearse, and noted that he was embarrassed to find the band played a different arrangement of the song than the one he had learned. Feeling that his performance left much to be desired, Peart produced and played on two Buddy Rich tribute albums titled &quot;Burning for Buddy: A Tribute to the Music of Buddy Rich&quot; in 1994 and 1997 in order to regain his aplomb.

While producing the first Buddy Rich tribute album, Peart was struck by the tremendous improvement in ex-Journey drummer Steve Smith&#x27;s playing, and asked him his &quot;secret&quot;. Smith responded he had been studying with drum teacher Freddie Gruber.

In early 2007, Peart and Cathy Rich discussed another Buddy tribute concert. At the recommendation of bassist Jeff Berlin, Peart once again augmented his swing style with formal drum lessons, this time under the tutelage of another pupil of Freddie Gruber, Peter Erskine, himself an instructor of Steve Smith. On October 18, 2008, Peart once again performed at the Buddy Rich Memorial Concert at New York&#x27;s Hammerstein Ballroom. The concert has since been released on DVD.

===Family deaths and recovery===
On August 10, 1997, soon after Rush&#x27;s Test for Echo Tour, Peart&#x27;s 19-year-old daughter (at the time his only child) Selena Taylor was killed in a single-car crash on Highway 401 near the town of Brighton, Ontario. His common-law wife of 23 years, Jacqueline Taylor, subsequently died of cancer on June 20, 1998. Peart attributed her death to the result of a &quot;broken heart&quot; and called it &quot;a slow suicide by apathy. She just didn&#x27;t care.&quot;

In his book &quot;Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road&quot;, Peart wrote that he told his bandmates at Jacqueline&#x27;s funeral, &quot;consider me retired&quot;. Peart took a long sabbatical to mourn and reflect, and travelled extensively throughout North and Central America on his motorcycle, covering . After his journey, Peart returned to the band. Peart wrote the book as a chronicle of his geographical and emotional journey.

Peart was introduced to photographer Carrie Nuttall in Los Angeles by longtime Rush photographer Andrew MacNaughtan. They married on September 9, 2000. In early 2001, Peart announced to his bandmates that he was ready to return to recording and performing. The product of the band&#x27;s return was the 2002 album &quot;Vapor Trails&quot;. At the start of the ensuing tour in support of the album, the band members decided that Peart would not take part in the daily grind of press interviews and &quot;meet and greet&quot; sessions upon their arrival in a new city that typically monopolise a touring band&#x27;s daily schedule. Peart always shied away from these types of in-person encounters, and it was decided that exposing him to a lengthy stream of questions about the tragic events of his life was not necessary.

After the release of &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; and his reunion with bandmates, Peart returned to work as a full-time musician. In the June 2009 edition of Peart&#x27;s website&#x27;s &quot;News, Weather, and Sports&quot;, titled &quot;Under the Marine Layer&quot;, he announced that he and Nuttall were expecting their first child. Olivia Louise Peart was born later that year.

In 2014, Peart acquired U.S. citizenship.

===Retirement===
Peart described himself as a &quot;retired drummer&quot; in an interview in December 2015:
 Peart had been suffering from chronic tendinitis and shoulder problems.

Geddy Lee clarified his bandmate was quoted out of context, and suggested Peart was simply taking a break, &quot;explaining his reasons for not wanting to tour, with the toll that it&#x27;s taking on his body.&quot; However, in January 2018, Alex Lifeson confirmed that Rush is &quot;basically done&quot;. Peart remained friends with his former bandmates.

===Death===
Peart died from glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020, in Santa Monica, California. He had been diagnosed three and a half years earlier, and the illness was a closely guarded secret in Peart&#x27;s inner circle until his death. His family made the announcement on January 10.

From the official Rush website:
Peart&#x27;s death was widely lamented by fans and fellow musicians alike, who considered it a substantial loss for popular music.

Peart&#x27;s father, Glen, also died of cancer on June 12, 2021.

==Musicianship==
===Style and influences===

Peart&#x27;s drumming skill and technique are well-regarded by fans, fellow musicians, and music journalists. His influences were eclectic, ranging from Pete Thomas, John Bonham, Carl Palmer, Michael Giles, Ginger Baker, Phil Collins, Chris Sharrock, Steve Gadd, Warren Cann, Stewart Copeland, Michael Shrieve and Keith Moon, to fusion and jazz drummers Billy Cobham, Buddy Rich, Bill Bruford and Gene Krupa. The Who was the first group that inspired him to write songs and play the drums.

Peart had long played matched grip but shifted to traditional as part of his style reinvention in the mid-1990s under the tutelage of jazz coach Freddie Gruber. He played traditional grip throughout his first instructional DVD &quot;A Work in Progress&quot; and on Rush&#x27;s &quot;Test for Echo&quot; studio album. Peart went back to using primarily matched, though he continued to switch to traditional at times when playing songs from &quot;Test for Echo&quot; and during moments when traditional grip felt more appropriate, such as during the rudimental snare drum section of his drum solo. He discussed the details of these switches in the DVD &quot;Anatomy of a Drum Solo&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Widely considered one of the most innovative drummers in rock history, Peart was famous for his state-of-the-art drum kits—more than 40 different drums were not out of the norm—precise playing style and on stage showmanship.&quot;

&quot;USA Today&quot;″s writers compared him favourably with other top-shelf rock drummers. He was &quot;considered one of the best rock drummers of all time, alongside John Bonham of Led Zeppelin; Ringo Starr of The Beatles; Keith Moon of The Who; Ginger Baker of Cream and Stewart Copeland of The Police.&quot; Noting that Peart was &quot;known for his technical proficiency&quot;, the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame inducted him in 1983.

Music critic Amanda Petrusich in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote: &quot;Watching Peart play the drums gave the impression that he might possess several phantom limbs. The sound was merciless.&quot;

===Equipment===

With Rush, Peart played Slingerland, Tama, Ludwig, and Drum Workshop drums, in that order. From &quot;2112&quot; to &quot;Counterparts&quot;, he used a 5 1/2 × 14 inch Slingerland &quot;Artist&quot; snare model (3-ply shell with 8 lugs). For the recording of &quot;Presto&quot;, he used a Ludwig and Solid Percussion piccolo snare drum.

Peart played Zildjian A-series cymbals and Wuhan china cymbals until the early 2000s, when he switched to Paragon, a line created for him by Sabian. In concert starting in 1984 on the Grace Under Pressure Tour, Peart used an elaborate 360-degree drum kit that would rotate as he played different sections of the kit.

During the late 1970s, Peart augmented his acoustic setup with diverse percussion instruments, including orchestra bells, tubular bells, wind chimes, crotales, timbales, timpani, gong, temple blocks, bell tree, triangle, and melodic cowbells. From the mid-1980s, Peart replaced several of these pieces with MIDI trigger pads. This was done in order to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area. Some purely electronic non-instrumental sounds were also used. One classic MIDI pad used is the MalletKAT Express, which is a two-octave electronic MIDI device that resembles a xylophone or piano. The MalletKAT Express is composed of rubber pads for the &quot;keys&quot; so that any stick can be used. Beginning with 1984&#x27;s &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;, he used Simmons electronic drums in conjunction with Akai digital samplers. Peart performed several songs primarily using the electronic portion of his drum kit. (e.g. &quot;Red Sector A&quot;, &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; on &quot;A Show of Hands&quot; and &quot;Mystic Rhythms&quot; on &quot;R30&quot;.)

Shortly after making the choice to include electronic drums and triggers, Peart added what became another trademark of his kit: a rotating drum riser. During live Rush shows, the riser allowed Peart to swap the prominent portions of the kit (traditional acoustic in front, electronic in back). A staple of Peart&#x27;s live drum solos was the in-performance rotation-and-swap of the front and back kits as part of the solo, a special effect that provided a symbolic transition of drum styles within the solo.
In the early 2000s, Peart began taking full advantage of the advances in electronic drum technology, primarily incorporating Roland V-Drums and continued use of samplers with his existing set of acoustic percussion. His digitally sampled library of both traditional and exotic sounds expanded over the years with his music.

In April 2006, Peart took delivery of his third Drum Workshop set, configured similarly to the R30 set, in a Tobacco Sunburst finish over curly maple exterior ply, with chrome hardware. He referred to this set, which he used primarily in Los Angeles, as the &quot;West Coast kit&quot;. Besides using it on recordings with Vertical Horizon, he played it while composing parts for Rush&#x27;s album &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot;. It featured a custom 23-inch bass drum; all other sizes remained the same as the R30 kit.

On March 20, 2007, Peart revealed that Drum Workshop prepared a new set of red-painted maple shells with black hardware and gold &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot; logos for him to play on the Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour.

Peart also designed his own signature series drumstick with Pro-Mark, the Promark PW747W, Neil Peart Signature drumsticks, made of Japanese Shira Kashi white oak.

During the 2010–11 Time Machine Tour, Peart used a new Drum Workshop kit; the kit was outfitted with copper-plated hardware and time machine designs to match the tour&#x27;s steampunk themes. Matching Paragon cymbals with clock imagery were also used.

===Solos===
Peart was noted for his distinctive in-concert drum solos, characterised by exotic percussion instruments and long, intricate passages in odd time signatures. His complex arrangements sometimes result in complete separation of upper- and lower-limb patterns; an ostinato dubbed &quot;The Waltz&quot; is a typical example. His solos were featured on every live album released by the band. On the early live albums (&quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot; and &quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot;), the drum solo was included as part of a song. On all subsequent live albums through &quot;Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland&quot;, the drum solo has been included as a separate track. The &quot;Clockwork Angels Tour&quot; album includes three short solos instead of a single long one: two interludes played during other songs and one standalone. Similarly, the &quot;R40 Live&quot; album includes two short solos performed as interludes.

A studio recording of Peart&#x27;s solo &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; was released as a flexi disc exclusive in the May 1987 issue of &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine. Peart&#x27;s instructional DVD &quot;Anatomy of a Drum Solo&quot; (2005) is an in-depth examination of how he constructs a solo that is musical rather than indulgent, using his solo from the 2004 R30 30th anniversary tour as an example.

==Lyricism==
Peart was the main lyricist for Rush. Literature heavily influenced his writings. In his early days with Rush, much of his lyrical output was influenced by fantasy, science fiction, mythology, and philosophy.

The 1980 album &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; saw Peart cease to use fantasy and mythological themes. 1981&#x27;s &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; showed that Peart was still interested in heroic, mythological figures, but now placed firmly in a modern, realistic context. The song &quot;Limelight&quot; from the same album is an autobiographical account of Peart&#x27;s reservations regarding his own popularity and the pressures associated with fame. From &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; onward, most of Peart&#x27;s lyrics revolved around social, emotional, and humanitarian issues, usually from an objective standpoint and employing the use of metaphors and symbolic representation.

Released in 1984, &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; strung together such despondent topics as the Holocaust (&quot;Red Sector A&quot;) and the death of close friends (&quot;Afterimage&quot;). With 1987&#x27;s &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot;, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Presto&quot;, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;, and 1993&#x27;s &quot;Counterparts&quot;, Peart continued to explore diverse lyrical motifs, even addressing the topics of love and relationships (&quot;Open Secrets&quot;, &quot;Ghost of a Chance&quot;, &quot;Speed of Love&quot;, &quot;Cold Fire&quot;, &quot;Alien Shore&quot;), subjects which he purposefully avoided in the past out of fear of using clichés. 2002&#x27;s &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; was heavily devoted to Peart&#x27;s personal issues, along with other humanitarian topics such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks (&quot;Peaceable Kingdom&quot;). The album &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot; dealt primarily and vociferously with Peart&#x27;s opinions regarding faith and religion.

The song suite &quot;2112&quot; focuses on the struggle of an individual against the collectivist forces of a totalitarian state. This became the band&#x27;s breakthrough release, but also brought unexpected criticism, mainly because of the credit of inspiration Peart gave to Ayn Rand in the liner notes. &quot;There was a remarkable backlash, especially from the English press, this being the late seventies, when collectivism was still in style, especially among journalists&quot;, Peart said. &quot;They were calling us &#x27;Junior fascists&#x27; and &#x27;Hitler lovers&#x27;. It was a total shock to me&quot;.

Regarding his seeming ideological fealty to Rand&#x27;s philosophy of Objectivism, Peart said, &quot;For a start, the extent of my influence by the writings of Ayn Rand should not be overstated. I am no one&#x27;s disciple.&quot; The lyrics of &quot;Faithless&quot; exhibit a life stance which has been closely identified with secular humanism. Peart explicitly discussed his religious views in &quot;The Masked Rider: Cycling in West Africa&quot;, in which he wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m a linear thinking agnostic, but not an atheist, folks.&quot;

In 2007, Peart was ranked No. 2 (after Sting) on the now defunct magazine &quot;Blender&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;worst lyricists in rock&quot;. In contrast, Allmusic called him &quot;one of rock&#x27;s most accomplished lyricists&quot;.

==Political views==
For most of his career, Peart had never publicly identified with any political party or organisation in Canada or the United States. Even so, his political and philosophical views have often been analysed through his work with Rush and through other sources. In October 1993, shortly before that year&#x27;s Canadian federal election, Peart appeared with then-Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic, but stated in that interview that he was an undecided voter.

Peart has often been categorised as an Objectivist and an admirer of Ayn Rand. This is largely based on his work with Rush in the 1970s, particularly the song &quot;Anthem&quot; and the album &quot;2112&quot;; the latter specifically credited Rand&#x27;s work. However, in his 1994 &quot;Rush Backstage Club Newsletter&quot;, while contending the &quot;individual is paramount in matters of justice and liberty,&quot; Peart specifically distanced himself from a strictly Objectivist line. In a June 2012 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, when asked if Rand&#x27;s words still speak to him, Peart replied, &quot;Oh, no. That was 40 years ago. But it was important to me at the time in a transition of finding myself and having faith that what I believed was worthwhile.&quot;

Although Peart was sometimes assumed to be a &quot;Conservative&quot; or &quot;Republican&quot; rock star, he criticised the US Republican Party by stating that the philosophy of the party is &quot;absolutely opposed to Christ&#x27;s teachings.&quot; In 2005, he described himself as a &quot;left-leaning libertarian&quot;, and is often cited as a libertarian celebrity.

In a 2015 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peart stated that he saw the US Democratic Party as the lesser evil: &quot;For a person of my sensibility, you&#x27;re only left with the Democratic party.&quot;

Peart was a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and worked with them on a radio public service announcement.

==Bibliography==
===Nonfiction===
Peart authored seven non-fiction books during his lifetime, the last of which was released in 2016.

Peart&#x27;s first book, titled &quot;The Masked Rider: Cycling in West Africa&quot;, was written in 1996 about a month-long bicycling tour through Cameroon in November 1988. The book details Peart&#x27;s travels through towns and villages with four fellow riders. The original had a limited print run, but after the critical and commercial success of Peart&#x27;s second book, &quot;Masked Rider&quot; was re-issued by ECW Press and remains in print.

After losing his wife and (at the time) only daughter, Peart embarked on a lengthy motorcycle road trip spanning North America. His experiences were penned in &quot;Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road&quot;. Peart and the rest of the band were always able to keep his private life at a distance from his public image in Rush. However, &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; is a first-person narrative of Peart on the road on a BMW R1100GS motorcycle, in an effort to put his life back together as he embarked on an extensive journey.

Years later, after his marriage to Nuttall, Peart took another road trip, this time by car. In his third book, &quot;Travelling Music: Playing Back the Soundtrack to My Life and Times&quot;, he reflects on his life, his career, his family, and music. As with his previous two books, it is a first-person narrative.

Three decades after Peart joined Rush, the band found itself on its 30th anniversary tour. Released in September 2006, &quot;Roadshow: Landscape with Drums – A Concert Tour by Motorcycle&quot; details the tour both from behind Peart&#x27;s drum kit and on his BMW R1150GS and R1200GS motorcycles.

Peart&#x27;s next book, &quot;Far and Away: A Prize Every Time&quot;, was published by ECW Press in May 2011. This book, which he worked on for two years, is formed around his travelling in North and South America. It tells how he found in a Brazilian town a unique combination of West African and Brazilian music. In 2014, a follow-up book, &quot;Far and Near: On Days like These&quot;, was published by ECW. It covers travels in North America and Europe. His last book, &quot;Far and Wide: Bring That Horizon to Me!&quot;, was published in 2016 and is based on his travels between stops on the R40 Live Tour of 2015.

===Fiction===
Peart worked with science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson to develop a novelisation of Rush&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot;; the book was published by ECW Press and debuted at #18 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; hardcover fiction best seller. The two collaborated again on a loose sequel, &quot;Clockwork Lives&quot;, published in 2015, which won the 2016 Colorado Book Award in the science fiction category. Snippets of the band&#x27;s lyrics can be found throughout both stories. Graphic novels of the first two &quot;Clockwork&quot; stories were created in 2015 and 2019, respectively. Peart worked with Anderson on a third and final novel during the last years of his life; after his death, his widow gave Anderson permission to continue the project. The book, &quot;Clockwork Destiny&quot;, was published by ECW Press in June 2022; like the first two novels, it incorporates portions of lyrics from Rush songs.

<text>The North Atlantic Treaty, also known as the Washington Treaty, forms the legal basis of, and is implemented by, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The treaty was signed in Washington, D.C., on 4 April 1949.

==Background==
The treaty was signed in Washington, D.C., on 4 April 1949 by a committee which was chaired by US diplomat Theodore Achilles. Earlier secret talks had been held at the Pentagon between 22 March and 1 April 1948, of which Achilles said:

The talks lasted about two weeks and by the time they finished, it had been secretly agreed that there would be a treaty, and I had a draft of one in the bottom drawer of my safe. It was never shown to anyone except Jack Hickerson]. I wish I had kept it, but when I left the Department in 1950, I dutifully left it in the safe and I have never been able to trace it in the archives. It drew heavily on the Rio Treaty, and a bit of the Brussels Treaty, which had not yet been signed, but of which we were being kept heavily supplied with drafts. The eventual North Atlantic Treaty had the general form, and a good bit of the language of my first draft, but with a number of important differences.

According to Achilles, another important author of the treaty was John D. Hickerson:

More than any human being Jack was responsible for the nature, content, and form of the Treaty...It was a one-man Hickerson treaty.

As a fundamental component of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty is a product of the US&#x27; desire to avoid overextension at the end of World War II, and consequently pursue multilateralism in Europe. It is part of the US&#x27; collective defense arrangement with Western European powers, following a long and deliberative process. The treaty was created with an armed attack by the Soviet Union against Western Europe in mind, although the mutual self-defense clause was never invoked during the Cold War.

By signing the North Atlantic Treaty, parties are &quot;determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of the peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.&quot;

===Non-founding members who joined before the dissolution of the Soviet Union===

The following four states joined the treaty after the 12 founding states, but before the dissolution of the Soviet Union:
===Members who joined after the dissolution of the Soviet Union===
The following 16 states joined the treaty after the dissolution of the Soviet Union:
===Withdrawal===
No state has rescinded its membership but some dependencies of member states have not requested membership after becoming independent:
==Articles==

===Article 1===
Article 1 of the treaty states that member parties &quot;settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.&quot;

Members seek to promote stability and well-being in the North Atlantic area through preservation of peace and security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.

===Article 2===
Article 2 of the treaty stipulates that &quot;The Parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening their free institutions, by bringing about a better understanding of the principles upon which these institutions are founded, and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being. They will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them.&quot; This is sometimes referred to as the Canada Clause after Pearson pushed for its inclusion in the treaty. This included proposals for a trade council, cultural program, technological sharing, and an information program. Of those, only the latter two were passed. Nonetheless, it has been brought up by observers commenting on trade disputes between members.

===Article 3===
Article 3 of the treaty states that &quot;In order more effectively to achieve the objectives of this Treaty, the Parties, separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.&quot;

This was interpreted in 2022 as the basis for the target for a 2% GDP expenditure rule, which was established as a loose guideline in 2006. This metric was confirmed again during the 2014 Wales summit.

It has also been used as a core concept for a mandate to strengthen member resilience: the ability to resist and recover from major disasters, failures in infrastructure, or traditional armed attack. This commitment was first accepted during the 2016 Warsaw summit, and further reiterated and clarified due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. In accordance with NATO documents, this has been understood to include seven key areas:
* Continuity of government during a crisis
* Energy and power grid infrastructure resilience
* Immigration control
* Food and water security
* Medical emergencies
* Resilient civil communications
* Effective transportation networks

===Article 4===
Article 4 is generally considered the starting point for major NATO operations, and therefore is intended for either emergencies or situations of urgency. It officially calls for consultation over military matters when &quot;the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened.&quot; Upon its invocation, the issue is discussed in the North Atlantic Council, and can formally lead into a joint decision or action (logistic, military, or otherwise) on behalf of the Alliance.

====Invocations====

It has been officially invoked seven times since the alliance&#x27;s creation.

====Threatened Invocations====

There have also been instances where Article 4 was not formally invoked, but instead threatened. In fact, this was viewed as one of the original intentions for Article 4: as a means to elevate issues and provide member nations a means of deterrence. For example, in November 2021, the Polish foreign ministry—along with Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia—briefly considered triggering Article 4 due to the Belarusian migrant crisis, but it was not formally requested. And on 28 December 2024, Swedish member of parliament and former minister of defense, Peter Hultqvist wanted the government to activate Article 4 in response to the 2024 Baltic Sea submarine cable disruptions.

===Article 5===
The key section of the treaty is Article 5. Its commitment clause defines the &quot;casus foederis&quot;. It commits each member state to consider an armed attack against one member state, in the areas defined by Article 6, to be an armed attack against them all. Upon such attack, each member state is to assist by taking &quot;such action as [the member state] deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.&quot; The article has only been invoked once, but considered in a number of other cases.

====Invocations====
=====September 11 attacks=====
Article 5 has been invoked only once in NATO history, after the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001. The invocation was confirmed on 4 October 2001, when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty. The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the 9/11 attacks included Operation Eagle Assist and Operation Active Endeavour, a naval operation in the Mediterranean which was designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction, as well as enhancing the security of shipping in general. Active Endeavour began on 4 October 2001.

====Threatened invocations====
===Article 6===

Article 6 states that Article 5 covers only member states&#x27; territories in Europe, North America, Turkey, and islands in the Atlantic north of the Tropic of Cancer.

A clarification regarding the territories to which Article 5 applies was issued by Article 2 of the Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the accession of Greece and Turkey signed on 22 October 1951. Subsequent expansions, such as to West Germany in 1955, were treated in the same way.

In 1954, following India&#x27;s annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the Portuguese government was precluded from invoking Article 5 due to Article 6, but it was understood at the time that Article 4 could be invoked.

It was the opinion in August 1965 of the US State Department, the US Defense Department, and the legal division of NATO that an attack on the U.S. state of Hawaii would not trigger the treaty, but an attack on the other 49 would. The Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla on the North African shore are thus not under NATO protection in spite of Moroccan claims to them. Legal experts have interpreted that other articles could cover the Spanish North African cities but this take has not been tested in practice. This is also why events such as the Balyun airstrikes did not trigger Article 5, as the Turkish troops that were attacked were in Syria, not Turkey.

On 16 April 2003, NATO agreed to take command of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, which includes troops from 42 countries. The decision came at the request of Germany and the Netherlands, the two states leading ISAF at the time of the agreement, and all nineteen NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously. The handover of control to NATO took place on 11 August, and marked the first time in NATO&#x27;s history that it took charge of a mission outside of the area delineated by Article 6.

===Article 7===

Article 7 states that the North Atlantic Treaty shall not be interpreted as affecting in any way the rights and obligations of member countries under the charter of the United Nations, or the primary responsibility of the United Nations Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.

===Article 8===

Article 8 is one of the more rarely referenced provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty. It regulates the relationship between the obligations of the NATO members under the treaty and other obligations of the allied nations (among themselves or with third parties). According to Article 8, members should not have any international commitments in conflict with the treaty, and undertake not to enter into any international &quot;engagement&quot; in conflict with the treaty. The following is a list of such active, intra-NATO military treaties.

===Article 9===
Establishes the North Atlantic Council, and is the only NATO body that derives its authority directly from the treaty. Its primary objectives as stated in the treaty is the enforcement of Article 3 and Article 5.

===Article 10===
Article 10 dictates the process by which other countries may join NATO, which is by unanimous agreement by current NATO members. Further, new NATO members can only consist of other European nations. In practice, this has turned into a set of action plans which an aspiring nation must follow in order to become a member, including the Membership Action Plan (MAP) mechanism and Intensified Dialogue formula.

===Article 11===
Article 11 indicated the process of the initial ratification of the treaty. Each signatory nation was required to ratify the treaty through their respective constitutional processes. In order to come into force, the treaty had to be ratified by Belgium, Canada, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

===Article 12===
Article 12 states the process by which the treaty may be amended, provided such amendments still affect the North Atlantic area and do not violate the Charter of the United Nations. In practice, this has only been used to clearly delineate which territories are under the purview of NATO.

===Article 13===
Article 13 delimits the process by which a member leaves NATO, which simply consists of a one-year notice by the member nation to the U.S. government in its role as the treaty depositary, which then promulgates the notice to the other member nations. This has been contemplated by a number of member nations, but so far has not happened aside from withdrawals due to independence of former territories or dependencies (namely, Algeria, Malta, and Cyprus).

Otherwise, the next closest option for a member nation is to instead withdraw from NATO&#x27;s military command structure, but not from NATO entirely. This happened with France in 1966, which rejoined in 2009; and with Greece in 1974, which rejoined in 1980 after the new Turkish military government ended its objections to Greek re-entry.

===Article 14===
Article 14 notes the official languages of NATO as English and French, and that the United States government shall promulgate copies of the treaty to the other member nations.

===Changes since signing===
Three official footnotes have been released to reflect the changes made since the treaty was written:

Regarding Article 6:
* The definition of the territories to which Article 5 applies was revised by Article 2 of the Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the accession of Greece and Turkey signed on 22 October 1951.

Regarding Article 6:
* On 16 January 1963, the North Atlantic Council noted that insofar as the former Algerian Departments of France were concerned, the relevant clauses of this Treaty had become inapplicable as from 3 July 1962.

Regarding Article 11:
* The Treaty came into force on 24 August 1949, after the deposition of the ratifications of all signatory states.

==Potential military conflict between NATO members==

Full-scale war between two or more NATO members has never occurred, and is not allowed by Article 1. Should conflict occur, there is not a well-established procedure as to what would happen. One argument is that by Article 8, the two members fall under abeyance of the Treaty; or that due to Article 5, NATO allies would thus enter into war against the aggressor party.

There have been several militarised disputes between NATO allies that have threatened this:

<doc id="22009" wikidata="Q418329" url="?curid=22009" title="Nitronium ion">
<text>The nitronium ion, , is a cation. It is an onium ion because its nitrogen atom has +1 charge, similar to ammonium ion . It is created by the removal of an electron from the paramagnetic nitrogen dioxide molecule , or the protonation of nitric acid (with removal of ).

It is stable enough to exist in normal conditions, but it is generally reactive and used extensively as an electrophile in the nitration of other substances. The ion is generated &quot;in situ&quot; for this purpose by mixing concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid according to the equilibrium:

== Structure ==
The nitronium ion is isoelectronic with carbon dioxide and has the same linear structure and bond angle of 180°. For this reason it has a similar vibrational spectrum to carbon dioxide. Historically, the nitronium ion was detected by Raman spectroscopy, because its symmetric stretch is Raman-active but infrared-inactive. The Raman-active symmetrical stretch was first used to identify the ion in nitrating mixtures.

== Salts ==
A few stable nitronium salts with anions of weak nucleophilicity can be isolated. These include nitronium perchlorate , nitronium tetrafluoroborate , nitronium hexafluorophosphate , nitronium hexafluoroarsenate , and nitronium hexafluoroantimonate . These are all very hygroscopic compounds.

The solid form of dinitrogen pentoxide, , actually consists of nitronium and nitrate ions, so it is an ionic compound, nitronium nitrate , not a molecular solid. However, dinitrogen pentoxide in liquid or gaseous state is molecular and does not contain nitronium ions.

==Related species==
The compounds nitryl fluoride, , and nitryl chloride, , are not nitronium salts but molecular compounds, as shown by their low boiling points (−72 °C and −6 °C respectively) and short nitrogen–halogen bond lengths (N–F 135 pm, N–Cl 184 pm).

Addition of one electron forms the neutral nitryl radical, ; in fact, this is fairly stable and known as the compound nitrogen dioxide.

The related negatively charged species is , the nitrite ion.

<text>, stylized as NEO•GEO and also written as NEOGEO, is a video game platform released in 1990 by Japanese game company SNK Corporation. It was initially released in two ROM cartridge-based formats: an arcade system board (Multi Video System; MVS) and a home video game console (Advanced Entertainment System; AES). The arcade system can hold multiple cartridges that can be exchanged out, a unique feature that contrasted to the dedicated single-game arcade cabinets of its time, making it popular with arcade operators.

The Neo Geo was marketed as the first 24-bit system; its CPU is actually a 16/32-bit 68000 with an 8-bit Z80 coprocessor, while its GPU chipset has a 24-bit graphics data bus. It was a very powerful system when released, more powerful than any video game console at the time, and many arcade systems such as rival Capcom&#x27;s CPS, which did not surpass it until the CP System II in 1993.

The Neo Geo AES was originally released solely as a rental console for video game stores in Japan called the &quot;Neo Geo Rental System&quot;, with its high manufacturing costs causing SNK not to release it for retail sale. This was later reversed due to high demand and it was released at retail as a luxury console. Adjusted for inflation, it was the most expensive home video game console ever released, costing . The AES had identical hardware to the MVS, allowing home users to play the games exactly as they were in the arcades; however, cartridges are not inter-compatible due to different physical sizes, meaning that software releases differed for the two systems. In 1994, SNK released the Neo Geo CD console which utilizes cheaper compact disc media as opposed to the cartridges used on the AES.

The Neo Geo MVS was a success during the 1990s due to the cabinet&#x27;s low cost, multiple cartridge slots, and compact size. Several successful video game series were released for the platform, such as &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot;, &quot;World Heroes&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, &quot;Twinkle Star Sprites&quot; and &quot;Metal Slug&quot;; game software production lasted until 2004, making Neo Geo the longest-supported arcade system of all time. The AES had a very niche market in Japan, though sales were very low in the U.S. due to its high price for both the hardware and software, but it has since gained a cult following and is now considered a collectable. Worldwide, one million Neo Geo MVS units have been shipped and 980,000 Neo Geo AES and CD units combined. Neo Geo hardware production lasted seven years; it was succeeded by Hyper Neo Geo 64.

==History==

=== Development ===

The Neo Geo hardware was an evolution of an older SNK/Alpha Denshi M68000 arcade platform that was used in &quot;Time Soldiers&quot; in 1987, further developed in the SNK M68000 hardware platform as used for &quot;P.O.W.: Prisoners of War&quot; in 1988. Contrary to other popular arcade hardware of the time, the SNK/Alpha Denshi hardware used sprite strips instead of the more common tilemap-based backgrounds. The Neo Geo hardware was essentially developed by Alpha Denshi&#x27;s Eiji Fukatsu, adding sprite scaling through the use of scaling tables stored in ROM as well as support for a much higher amount of data on cartridges and better sound hardware. The system&#x27;s hardware specifications were finalized in December 1989.

Takashi Nishiyama left Capcom, where he had created the fighting game &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1987), to join SNK after they invited him to join the company. There, he was involved in developing the Neo Geo. He proposed the concept of an arcade system that uses ROM cartridges like a game console, and also proposed a home console version of the system. His reasons for these proposals were to make the system cheaper for markets such as China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Central America, and South America, where it was difficult to sell dedicated arcade games due to piracy. Nishiyama also created the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; fighting game franchise, as a spiritual successor to the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. He also worked on the fighting game franchises &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, as well as the run and gun video game series &quot;Metal Slug&quot;.

=== Release ===
The Neo Geo was announced and demonstrated on January 31, 1990, in Osaka, Japan. SNK exhibited several Neo Geo games at Japan&#x27;s Amusement Machine Operators&#x27; Union (AOU) show in February 1990, including &quot;NAM-1975&quot;, &quot;Magician Lord&quot;, &quot;Baseball Stars Professional&quot;, &quot;Top Player&#x27;s Golf&quot; and &quot;Riding Hero&quot;. The Neo Geo then made its overseas debut at Chicago&#x27;s American Coin Machine Exposition (ACME) in March 1990, with several games demonstrated. The system was then released in Japan on April 26, 1990. Initially, the AES home system was only available for rent to commercial establishments, such as hotel chains, bars and restaurants. When customer response indicated that some gamers were willing to buy a console, SNK expanded sales and marketing into the home console market in 1991.Neo Geo&#x27;s graphics and sound are largely superior to other contemporary home consoles, computers (such as the X68000) and even some arcade systems. Unlike earlier systems, the Neo Geo AES was intended to reproduce the same quality of the game as the arcade MVS system. The MVS was one of the most powerful arcade units at the time, allowing the game ROM to be loaded from interchangeable cartridges instead of using custom, dedicated hardware cabinets for each game.

In the United States, the console&#x27;s debut price was planned to be and included two joystick controllers and a game: either &quot;Baseball Stars Professional&quot; or &quot;NAM-1975&quot;. However, the price was raised and its American launch debuted as the Gold System at (). Later, the Gold System was bundled with &quot;Magician Lord&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;. The Silver System package, launched at , included one joystick controller and no pack-in game. Other games were launched at about and up. At double or quadruple the price of the competition, the console and its games were accessible only to a niche market. However, its full compatibility meant that no additional money was being spent on porting or marketing for the AES, since the MVS&#x27; success was automatically feeding the AES, making the console profitable for SNK.

=== Lifetime and discontinuation ===
In January 1991, Romstar released an arcade conversion kit version of the Neo Geo in the United States, allowing the conversion of an arcade cabinet into a Neo Geo system. The same month, the Neo Geo home console version made its North American debut at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). SNK also announced that there would generally be a roughly six-month gap between the arcade and home releases of Neo Geo games.

When real-time 3D graphics became the norm in the arcade industry, the Neo Geo&#x27;s 2D hardware was unable to do likewise. Despite this, Neo Geo arcade games retained profitability through the mid-1990s, and the system was one of three 1995 recipients of the American Amusement Machine Association&#x27;s Diamond Awards (which are based strictly on sales achievements). SNK developed a new home console in 1994, called the Neo Geo CD. A new arcade system was also made in 1997, called Hyper Neo Geo 64. However, these two systems had low popularity and only a few games.

While it ceased manufacturing home consoles by the end of 1997, SNK continued making software for the original 2D Neo Geo. Despite being very aged by the end of the decade, the Neo Geo continued getting popular releases, such as the critically acclaimed &quot;The King of Fighters 2002&quot;. The last official game by SNK for the Neo Geo system, &quot;Samurai Shodown V Special&quot;, was released in 2004, 14 years after the system&#x27;s introduction.

On August 31, 2007, SNK stopped offering maintenance and repairs to Neo Geo home consoles, handhelds, and games.

==Technical details==
Each joystick controller is 280 mm (width) × 190 mm (depth) × 95 mm (height) (11 × 8 × 2.5 in.) and contains the same four-button layout as the arcade MVS cabinet.

The arcade machines have a memory card system by which a player could save a game to return to at a later time and could also be used to continue play on the SNK home console of the same name.

The arcade version of the video game hardware is often referred to as the &quot;MVS&quot;, or Multi Video System (available in 1-slot, 2-slot, 4-slot, and 6-slot variations, differing in the amount of game cartridges loaded into the machine at the time), with its console counterpart referred to as the &quot;AES&quot;, or Advanced Entertainment System. Early motherboard revisions contain daughterboards, used to enhance the clarity of the video output.

The MVS and AES hardware can execute identical machine code. Owners can move EPROMs from one type to the other, and the game will still run. The program specifics for both MVS and AES game options are contained on every game ROM, whether the cartridge is intended for home or arcade use. However, the arcade and home cartridges do have a different pinout. They were designed this way to prevent arcade operators from buying the cheaper home carts and then using them in arcades. In a few home version games, the arcade version of the game can be unlocked by inputting a special code.

===ROM sizes and startup screens===
The original specification for ROM size is up to 330 megabits, hence the system displaying &quot;Max 330 Mega Pro-Gear Spec&quot; upon startup. While no technical advances were required to achieve it, some games over 100 megabits, such as &quot;Top Hunter&quot;, followed this screen by displaying an animation proclaiming &quot;The 100Mega Shock!&quot;. The original ROM size specification was later enhanced on cartridges with bank switching memory technology, increasing the maximum cartridge size to around 716 megabits. These new cartridges also cause the system to display &quot;Giga Power Pro-Gear Spec&quot; upon startup or during attract mode, indicating this enhancement.
==Specifications==

The system uses seven different specialist processors, which divide the workload for the visuals, audio and gameplay.

===CPU===
* Main CPU processor: Motorola 68000 (often a second sourced version, usually by Toshiba or Hitachi, initially a Hitachi HD68HC000PS12) @ 12 MHz (16/32-bit instructions @ 1.75 MIPS)
* CPU co-processor: Zilog Z80 @ 4 MHz (also used as audio controller) (8/16-bit instructions @ 0.58 MIPS)

RAM: 214 KB SRAM
* Main 68000 RAM: 64 KB (32 KB SRAM ×2)
* Video RAM: 84 KB SRAM
** Main VRAM: 64 KB (32 KB SRAM ×2)
** Palette memory: 16 KB (8 KB SRAM ×2)
** Fast video sprite RAM: 4 KB (2 KB SRAM ×2)

===Display===

The SNK custom video chipset allows the system to draw sprites in vertical strips of tiles (blocks of 16x16 pixels), and can be 32 tiles tall (total of 512 pixels); it can draw up to 380 sprites on the screen at a time, with the limitation of 96 sprites per scanline. Each tile can be assigned a palette, which defines 15 colors (+ transparency). Allowing up to 256 palettes at the same time, the system can display 3840 colors simultaneously. Unlike most other video game consoles of its time, the Neo Geo does not use scrolling tilemap background layers. Instead, it has a single non-scrolling tilemap layer called the fix layer, while any scrolling layers rely exclusively on drawing sprites to create the scrolling backgrounds (like the Sega Y Board). By laying multiple sprites side by side, the system can simulate a tilemap background layer. The Neo Geo sprite system represents a step between conventional sprites and tilemaps.

* GPU chipset:
** SNK LSPC2-A2 (line sprite generator &amp; VRAM interface) @ 24 MHz

== Reception ==
The Neo Geo MVS was a worldwide commercial success upon release in arcades, becoming one of the highest-earning machines at various arcades across markets such as North America and Australia in 1990. In North America, three Neo Geo games were later among the ten top-grossing arcade software conversion kits in December 1992: &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; at number one, &quot;World Heroes&quot; at number two, and &quot;King of the Monsters 2&quot; at number ten. The Neo Geo MVS received Diamond awards from the American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA) two years in a row, for being among America&#x27;s top four best-selling arcade machines of 1992 (with &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2&quot;) and 1993. In 1994, the Neo Geo MVS was best-selling arcade printed circuit board (PCB) worldwide.

In the 1990 &quot;Gamest&quot; Awards, the Neo Geo received the Special Award. At the 1991 AMOA Awards held by the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA), the Neo Geo won the &quot;Most Innovative New Technology&quot; award.

In a 1993 review, &quot;GamePro&quot; gave the Neo Geo a &quot;thumbs up&quot;. Though they voiced several criticisms, noting that the system was not as powerful as the soon-to-launch 3DO and had few releases which were not fighting games, they generally praised both the hardware and games library and recommended that gamers who could not afford the console (which was still priced at $649.99) play the games in the arcade.

=== Legacy ===
The Neo Geo is the first home game console to feature a removable memory card for saved games.

The GameTap subscription service has included a Neo Geo emulator and a small library of Neo Geo games. In 2007 Nintendo announced that Neo Geo games would appear on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console, starting with &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, and &quot;World Heroes&quot;. Neo Geo games were released through Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network (For the PlayStation 3/PlayStation Network, the service was called NEOGEO Station), including &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot;, &quot;Samurai Shodown II&quot;, &quot;Metal Slug 3&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot;. Many Neo Geo games were released on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, and Nintendo Switch through the Arcade Archives service.

Homebrew activity began after the console&#x27;s discontinuation, both by noncommercial hobbyists and commercially.

Neo Geo has a community of collectors. Because of the limited production runs received by cartridges amongst the sizable available arcade library, some of the rarest Neo Geo games can sell for well over $1,000. The most valuable game is the European AES version of &quot;Kizuna Encounter: Super Tag Battle&quot;. The MVS market provides a cheaper alternative to the expensive and rare home cartridges, and complete arcade kits are priced at a premium. It is also possible to play the MVS cartridges, which generally cost much less, on the AES home system through the use of adapters.

In 2009, the Neo Geo was ranked 19th out of the 25 best video game consoles of all time by video game website IGN.

== Recreated hardware ==
Since the 2010s, SNK have revived the Neo Geo in new form factors with built-in games, created both by themselves and by officially licensed third-parties.

=== Neo Geo X ===
The Neo Geo X, an officially licensed device with a collection of Neo Geo games pre-installed, was first released in 2012 by TOMMO Inc. After just one year and a lukewarm reception due to its price and poor quality of the emulation, on October 2, 2013, SNK Playmore terminated the license agreement and demanded an immediate cease and desist of distribution and sales of all licensed products.

=== Neo Geo Mini ===

On June 9, 2018, SNK announced the Neo Geo Mini, a miniature sized semi-portable arcade cabinet loosely resembling the appearance of a Japanese Neo Geo MVS, which features 40 built-in SNK titles, and was released on July 24, 2018, in Japan to celebrate SNK&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The games on the system are the AES home console versions with limited continues, however, the Neo Geo Mini features a save/load state system which allows players to save and load the game at any time to continue the game and has up to four save files per game. In addition to its 320x224 pixel display, it can be connected to a TV via an HDMI cable and it has two ports for external Neo Geo Mini control pads based on the Neo Geo CD controllers.

SNK also released an international version of the Neo Geo Mini, which was released outside Japan on October 15, 2018, and later in Japan on November 15, 2018. The international version contains the same features as the Japanese Neo Geo Mini but 14 out of the 40 titles are different (including all of the &quot;Metal Slug&quot; games) and a different interface. As such, both versions have 54 different SNK titles in total. On July 19, 2019, SNK announced the discontinuation of the original Neo Geo Mini and the international version.

In December 2018, a limited edition Christmas themed Neo Geo Mini was released, featuring nine games previously unreleased on the other two versions. On June 27, 2019, a limited edition called &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; was released, in three colors; white, red, and blue, with a black edition being released later on. This edition has 40 games, featuring all of the &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; games, including three new games that have never been included in prior versions. Another limited edition was released exclusively in Japan on September 30, 2019, called &quot;Samurai Spirits Kuroko&quot;, with 48 games.

=== Neo Geo Arcade Stick Pro ===
In September 2019, SNK announced the release of the Neo Geo Arcade Stick Pro. Resembling a large white arcade stick complete with joystick and 8 buttons, it has 20 built-in games as well as HDMI output for TVs. It can also be used on any of the Neo Geo Mini units via an included adapter and is also backwards compatible with the game pads released for the Mini. The initial 20 built-in games were all fighting games, but more games were added by SNK through software updates to make a total of 40.

In November 2020, a special limited Christmas edition of the Neo Geo Arcade Stick Pro was released. The package includes a Neo Geo CD style control pad, a cover for the arcade stick, an arcade stick ball cover, a sticker sheet and a Neo Geo 30th anniversary artbook. All 40 games are included, unlocked from the start.
=== Unico ===
In August 2020, the company Unico announced the Neo Geo MVSX, an arcade table top system capable of playing MVS and AES titles that are pre-installed on the system itself, with 2 player support with a 17-inch screen, and pre-loaded with 50 games. Also available is a 32-inch stand to allow it to work as a free-standing unit resembling a vintage MVS cabinet. It was released in November 2020 in North America.

In late 2023, Unico released another Neo Geo Mini, this one in the style of an MVS arcade cabinet. It could be purchased with or without an additional Unico red controller, modelled the same way as the pre-existing Neo Geo mini controllers and an HDMI cable. It comes pre-loaded with 45 games, most of them are the same as those found on the MVSX, but with five games removed from the line up.

<text>The is a home video game console produced by SNK Corporation, released on September 9, 1994. The system is the same platform as the cartridge-based Neo Geo released four years earlier, but converted to the cheaper CD media format which retailed at per title compared to over $200 for the equivalent cartridge.

The Neo Geo CD was launched with a bundled control pad instead of a joystick like the AES version of the Neo Geo came with; however, the system was compatible with controllers from the AES. The Neo Geo CD had met with limited success due to it being plagued with slow loading times that could vary from 30 to 60 seconds between loads, depending on the game. As of September 30, 1997, there had been 570,000 Neo Geo CD units sold worldwide; production of all Neo Geo hardware was discontinued in 1997, while new software continued to be released until 2004.

==History==

The Neo Geo CD was first unveiled at the 1994 Tokyo Toy Show. The console uses the same CPU set-up as the arcade and cartridge-based Neo Geo systems, facilitating conversions. SNK planned to release Neo Geo CD versions of every Neo Geo game still in the arcades.

Three versions of the Neo Geo CD were released:

# A tray-loading Japan-only version, colloquially known as the &quot;front loader&quot;
# A top-loading international version, colloquially known as the &quot;top loader&quot;
# An upgraded Japan-only faster-loading double-speed version

The front loader is the original console design, while the top loader version was developed shortly before the Neo Geo CD launch as a smaller, cheaper alternative model.

All three versions of the system have no region lock, but they are region aware, and some games will display English or Japanese depending on the console&#x27;s region setting. The system can also play Audio CDs.

The system itself was originally priced at . Approximately one month after launch, SNK reported that they had sold the Neo Geo CD&#x27;s entire initial shipment of 50,000 units.

Criticism of the system&#x27;s generally long loading times began even before launch; a report in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; on the Neo Geo CD&#x27;s unveiling noted, &quot;At the show, they were showing a demo of &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;. The prototype of the machine that they showed was single speed, and the load time was 14-28 seconds between rounds. You can see that the screen[shot] on the right is a load screen.&quot;

In response to criticism of the Neo Geo CD&#x27;s long load times, SNK planned to produce a model with a double speed CD-ROM drive for North America, compared to the single speed drive of the Japanese and European models. However, the system missed its planned North American launch date of October 1995, and while SNK declined to give a specific reason for the delay, in their announcement of the new January 1996 launch date they stated that they had decided against using a double speed drive. Their Japanese division had produced an excess number of single speed units and found that modifying these units to double speed was more expensive than they had initially thought, so SNK opted to sell them as they were, postponing production of a double speed model until they had sold off the stock of single speed units.

The CDZ was released on December 29, 1995 as the Japanese market replacement for SNK&#x27;s previous efforts (the &quot;front loader&quot; and the &quot;top loader&quot;).

The CDZ was only officially sold in Japan during its production; however, its faster loading times made it a desirable import for enthusiasts in both Europe and North America. The system&#x27;s technical specs are identical to the previous models except that it includes a double-speed CD-ROM drive, and different CD controller circuitry.

Reviewing the Neo Geo CD in late 1995, &quot;Next Generation&quot; noted SNK&#x27;s reputation for fun games but argued that their failure to upgrade the Neo Geo system with 3D capabilities would keep them from producing any truly &quot;cutting edge&quot; games, and limit the console to the same small cult following as the Neo Geo AES system although with less expensive games. They gave it 1 1/2 out of 5 stars.

In response to reader inquiries about Neo Geo CD software, &quot;GamePro&quot; reported in an issue cover dated May 1997 that SNK had quietly discontinued the console by this time. It was also the last home console produced by SNK.

==Technical specifications==

* Main Processor: Motorola 68000 running at 12 MHz. Although the original CPU was designed by Motorola, many of the 68000 CPUs in Neo Geo hardware are manufactured by second-sources. The most common CPU is the TMP68HC000 manufactured by Toshiba.
* Coprocessor: Zilog Z80 running at 4 MHz
* Colors on screen: 4,096
* Colors available: 65,536
* Resolution: 304 x 224
* Max sprites: 384
* Max sprite size: 16 x 512
* Number of planes: 3 (128 sprites per plane as the Neo Geo does not use tiles for its planes like with most game systems at the time)

The system is also capable of reading Redbook standard compact disc audio.

In addition to the multi-AV port (nearly identical to the one used on the Sega Genesis model 1, though they are not interchangeable), all Neo Geo CD models had composite RCA A/V and S-Video out jacks on the rear of the console.

The CD system&#x27;s 56 Mbit / 7 MB of RAM was split accordingly:

* 68000 program memory: 2 MB
* Fix layer memory: 128 KB
* Graphics memory: 4 MB
* Sound sample memory: 1 MB
* Z80 program memory: 64 kB
* VRAM: 512Kb (For graphics attributes)
* SRAM: 2 KB (For high scores / general save data)

==Software==
While the Neo Geo CD library consists primarily of ports of MVS and AES titles, there are a few MVS arcade games which were not officially released for the Neo Geo AES and ported instead to the Neo Geo CD. These include &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot;, &quot;Janshin Densetsu: Quest of Jongmaster&quot; (a Mahjong game also released for the PC Engine), &quot;Power Spikes II&quot;, &quot;Neo Drift Out: New Technology&quot;, and &quot;Pleasure Goal: 5 on 5 Mini Soccer&quot; (&quot;Futsal: 5-on-5 Mini Soccer&quot;).

A few games which were unreleased in MVS and AES formats were also released exclusively for the Neo Geo CD. These include &quot;Ironclad: Tesshō Rusha&quot; (&quot;Chōtetsu Burikingā&quot;, &quot;BRIKIN&#x27;GER&quot;), &quot;Crossed Swords II&quot;, &quot;ZinTrick&quot; (&quot;Oshidashi Zintorikku&quot;), &quot;ADK World&quot;, &quot;Neo Geo CD Special&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96 Neo Collection&quot;, &quot;Samurai Shodown RPG&quot; (&quot;Shinsetsu Samurai Spirits: Bushidō Retsuden&quot;; an RPG spin-off of the &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; series that was also released for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn), and &quot;Idol-Mahjong Final Romance 2&quot; (an arcade game which is not an MVS game, but was ported directly to the Neo Geo CD).

Two prototype games were in development:
&quot;Bang² Busters&quot; [&quot;Bang Bang Busters&quot;] (Made by Visco in 2000. Released in 2010 for Neo Geo CD by N.C.I.) and 
&quot;Treasure of the Caribbean&quot; [&quot;Caribe no Zaihō&quot;] (Made by Face in 1994. Released in 2011 for Neo Geo CD by N.C.I./Le Cortex).

<text>Neopets is a free-to-play virtual pet browser game. First launched in 1999, the game allows users to own virtual pets (&quot;Neopets&quot;) and explore a virtual world called &quot;Neopia.&quot; Players can earn one of two virtual currencies. One currency, called Neopoints, can be obtained for free through on-site features like games, events, and contests. The other, Neocash (NC), is purchased with real-world money and can be exchanged for wearable items for pets.

Players can buy digital food, toys, and other items for their Neopets to keep them happy. They can also customize the appearance of their Neopets by applying different colors, clothing, accessories, and styles. Additionally, users can train their Neopets to fight in the &quot;Battledome,&quot; which offers both PvP and PvE battles. Players interact with others through social features like message boards and guilds, or by buying, selling, and trading items with each other.

==History and development==

=== Creation and growth (1999–2005) ===
&quot;Neopets&quot; was conceived in 1997 by Adam Powell, a British student at the University of Nottingham at the time. He shared this idea with Donna Williams and the two started work on the site in September 1999, with Powell responsible for the programming and the database and Williams the web design and art. Their original office was located in Guildford. With the help of two friends, the site launched on 15 November 1999. Powell stated that the original goal was to &quot;keep university students entertained, and possibly make some cash from banner advertising&quot;. The site contained popular culture references, such as a Neopet that was simply a picture of entertainer Bruce Forsyth, and another that was a cartoon version of singer Macy Gray.

The user base grew by word of mouth and by Christmas 1999, &quot;Neopets&quot; was logging 600,000 page views daily and sought investors to cover the high cost of running the site. Later in the month, American businessman Doug Dohring was introduced to the creators of the site and, along with other investors, bought a majority share in January of the following year. Neopets, Inc. was incorporated by Dohring in February 2000, and began business on 28 April. Dohring used Scientology&#x27;s Org Board to manage the company. Powell and Williams were unaware of the Scientology connections until searching the employees at the newly formed company six months later but did not address this until the company hired a woman to introduce Scientology to &quot;Neopets&quot;. Powell and Williams stopped the addition of any Scientology education to &quot;Neopets&quot; and ensured such content never made it into anything site-related.

With the new company, intellectual property that did not belong to &quot;Neopets&quot; was removed but the site kept the British spellings. The website made money from the first paying customers using an advertising method trademarked as &quot;immersive advertising&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Neopets&quot; released a premium version and started showing advertisements on the basic site that were not shown to premium members.

In the 2000s, &quot;Neopets&quot; was consistently noted as one of the &quot;stickiest&quot; sites for children&#x27;s entertainment. A press release from &quot;Neopets&quot; in 2001 stated that Neopets.com led in site &quot;stickiness&quot; in May and June, with the average user spending 117 minutes a week. &quot;Neopets&quot; also led in the average number of hours spent per user per month in December 2003 with an average of 4 hours and 47 minutes. A 2004 article stated that Nielsen//NetRatings reported that people were spending around three hours a month on &quot;Neopets&quot;, more than any other site in its Nielsen category. By May 2005, a &quot;Neopets&quot;-affiliated video game producer cited about 35 million unique users, 11 million unique IP addresses per month, and 4 billion web page views per month. This producer also described 20% of the users as 18 or older, with the median of the remaining 80% at about 14.

=== Viacom (2005–2014) ===
Viacom, the American conglomerate that owns Nickelodeon, purchased Neopets, Inc. on 20 June 2005 for $160 million and announced plans to focus more on the use of banner ads over the site&#x27;s existing immersive advertising. Founders Powell and Williams left Neopets, Inc. shortly after the purchase due to creative differences. The following year, a gaming event called The Altador Cup was released to improve interactivity between users and to coincide with the 2006 FIFA World Cup; it had 10.4 million participants in its first year. 2006 also saw the release of &quot;Neopets Mobile&quot;, a T-Mobile exclusive premium service which allowed users to visit the new land of Lutari Island. The service was discontinued on 30 June 2009, leaving the island completely inaccessible. &quot;Neopets&quot; was consistently ranked among the top ten &quot;stickiest&quot; sites by both Nielsen//NetRatings and comScore Media Metrix in 2005 and 2006.

The game website was redesigned on 27 April 2007 and included changes to the user interface and the ability to customise Neopets. In June, Viacom promoted &quot;Neopets&quot; through minishows on its Nickelodeon channel. Promotions included the second Altador Cup and led to an increase in traffic through the site. However, according to Nielsen//NetRatings, in 2007, &quot;Neopets&quot; lost about 15% of its audience over the previous year. On 17 July, the NC Mall was launched in a partnership with Korean gaming company Nexon Corporation. It allows users to use real money to purchase Neocash to buy exclusive virtual items. In February 2008, comScore ranked it as the stickiest kids entertainment site with the average user spending 2 hours and 45 minutes per month. On 17 June 2008, Viacom formed the Nickelodeon Kids &amp; Family Virtual Worlds Group to &quot;encompass all paid and subscription gaming initiatives across all relevant platforms&quot;, including &quot;Neopets&quot;. By June 2011, &quot;Neopets&quot; announced that the website had logged 1 trillion page views since its creation.

=== JumpStart and NetDragon (2014–2023) ===
JumpStart Games acquired the Neopets property from Viacom in March 2014. Server migration began in September. JumpStart-owned Neopets was immediately characterized by glitches and site lag. On 6 March 2015, much of the Neopets Team remaining from Viacom were laid off. Then-CEO of JumpStart David Lord assured the community that there were no plans to shut down Neopets, and instead resources were allocated to develop new &quot;events and stories&quot; and address site stability and overall performance on mobile platforms, with plans to expand to additional platforms including Facebook.

During the weekend of 27–28 June 2015, the site&#x27;s chat filters stopped working. The site&#x27;s forums were flooded with age-inappropriate messages. In a statement on Facebook, JumpStart apologized, explaining that the issue was due to a &quot;facility move,&quot; and that during that move, the moderation team was not able to access the Neopets community.

In January 2017, Neopets then-JumpStart CEO David Lord estimated 100,000 active daily users. On 3 July 2017, Chinese company NetDragon acquired JumpStart Games. The Neopets team started developing in-universe plots again in 2017 for the first time since the JumpStart acquisition, with the first such event going live in late 2017. In January 2020, Neopets logged 3.4 million views per month, a significant decline from its peak. With support for Adobe Flash ending in 2020, the Neopets Team announced in 2019 that it planned to transition Flash elements of the site to HTML5 by the end of 2020. The team prioritized converting popular features, and some parts of the site were left non-functional when Flash support ended. The Neopets Team also announced the development of a mobile app for the site, which was later scrapped in favor of a &quot;mobile-friendly&quot; browser version of the site which launched via an open beta on June 9, 2020. In June 2020, JumpStart CEO Jim Czulewicz estimated Neopets had 100,000 daily active users and 1.5 million monthly active players.

On 13 June 2023, JumpStart announced it would be closing on 30 June.

==== Metaverse ====
On 22 September 2021, the Neopets Metaverse NFT project was announced in collaboration with JumpStart, Cherrypicks, Raydium, and Moonvault. The Neopets Metaverse was to feature a &quot;modernised 3D remake of the classic Neopets game&quot; where players would be required to own Neopets NFTs to play. Prior to the official launch of the metaverse, the project put 20,000 Neopets NFTs up for sale but only 4,225 were purchased. A unique visual glitch revealed that at least one of the promotional images on the Neopets Metaverse website advertising these NFTs was generated using the Neopets fan site Dress to Impress; the image was replaced shortly after it was noticed. The project received a significant amount of criticism from within the Neopets community and it was formally canceled in July 2023.

=== World of Neopia (2023–present) ===

On 17 July 2023, it was announced that Neopets had been purchased from NetDragon through a management buyout deal led by Neopets Chief Metaverse Officer Dominic Law, the former Director of New Markets at both NetDragon and Cherrypicks. The resulting independent company, World of Neopia Inc., is composed of team members from both Neopets and Neopets Metaverse, including Dominic Law as CEO. It was also stated that the site had operated at a loss for over a decade and it announced that Neopets had received $4 million in investment funding in early 2023. Additional funding from the management buyout is said to equip World of Neopia, Inc. to make &quot;meaningful changes in pursuit of a Neopian renaissance.&quot; The changes include a homepage revamp and plans to create a mobile app. Following the transition, it was reported that the site achieved its highest revenue stream in 2023 since 2017 (which was the same year Netdragon acquired Jumpstart), and had tripled its monthly active userbase from 100,000 to 300,000 users by April 2024. Dominic Law also claimed that the company was on track to be profitable by the end of 2024. It was also reported that the site demographics had shifted to be significantly older compared to when the website was at its peak, with the majority of users now being over the age of 18 with 40% being reported to between the ages of 25 and 34, and 26% of users being between the ages of 18 and 24, which was reportedly due to many users of the site now being drawn to use Neopets due to nostalgia reasons.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Neopets&quot; allows users to create and care for digital pets called &quot;Neopets&quot; and explore the virtual world of Neopia. There is no set objective for the users, but they are expected to feed and care for their Neopets when they grow hungry or ill. Neopets will not die if neglected, but their health can limit their gameplay.

Neopets come in a variety of species and colors and users can create or adopt their own. Users can obtain items to interact with their Neopet, such as books to read and toys to play with them. Neopets can be customised with certain clothing items, paintbrushes, morphing potions, and accessories. Neopets themselves can have pets of their own called Petpets.

Users can build a customisable Neohome for their Neopets and furnish it with furniture, wallpaper, and flooring. Neopets can battle against other Neopets or non-player characters in the Battledome but they cannot die there.

Neopia is a virtual planet with fantasy lands inhabited by Neopets and other virtual creatures. Each land has a different theme, such as pirates or prehistory, and their own shops, games, and attractions. Neopia follows its own calendar and time zone, which runs concurrent with real-world Pacific Time, and has tie-ins with certain real-world holidays such as Halloween and Christmas.

It has its own economy and trade markets based on Neopoints. Users can earn Neopoints through various means including playing games and selling items, which can be invested or used to buy various virtual goods and services.

The site is regularly updated with features like new games, items, and content. Occasionally, the Neopets team release interactive storylines to expand the in-universe lore. In addition to the site content updated by the Neopets team, users also contribute content to the site. User contributions come in the form of prescreened submissions and readily editable content that is automatically filtered, such as the site&#x27;s weekly electronic newspaper &quot;The Neopian Times&quot;. There are different types of submissions that will be accepted.

===Games===
Users can earn Neopoints from playing games. Games come in many different genres, which include action, puzzles, and chance. Most games have set maximum earnings or playtime. Players may also earn trophies and other awards from games if they score high enough or perform better than other users. Both single-player and multiplayer browser games are available.

The site houses over 100 games; the earliest games released were simple browser-based PHP games. Most of the site&#x27;s games run on Adobe Flash Player, while a handful of others use Adobe Shockwave Player. In April 2020, in anticipation of the discontinuation of Adobe Flash, &quot;Neopets&quot; released HTML5 versions of seven of these games, followed by the release of an additional three in October 2021. In January 2021, Adobe Flash was discontinued, making most of the original Adobe Flash games impossible to play without workarounds. In July 2023, most of the original Flash games were restored via the site&#x27;s integration with the Ruffle Adobe Flash emulator, with some games experiencing compatibility issues.

Users can also participate in contests and spotlights judged by staff to showcase the users&#x27; talents. Quests to retrieve items may also be performed for specific NPCs. Challenges may be made against other players or random players in a &quot;World Challenge&quot; for a prize piece and Neopoints from the jackpot for certain web games. Monthly competitions also exist for multiplayer games with four week-long elimination rounds.

===Economy===
The economy is based on Neopoints. Users can also exchange real money for Neocash, used exclusively for the NC Mall. Users can earn Neopoints through playing games, selling items, and other transactions. Once earned, they can be saved in the bank, used to buy items from other users or non-player character (NPC) shops, used to buy and sell stocks in the Neopian stock market called the NEODAQ (a parody of the NASDAQ), or used to buy various other things. Items can be bought from shops found throughout the world of Neopia that are run by NPCs who may allow bargaining. Users can open their own shops to sell items, sometimes after obtaining those items at a lower price from sources such as other shops or charities. Items may also be exchanged through trading or auctions.

==== Black market ====
In 2021, it was reported that a black market had arisen on the site, mainly driven around unconverted Neopets that had become unavailable for new users after the art style for default Neopets changed in 2007. As not all Neopets were converted during the art style change, unconverted Neopets had become valuable. A number of these unconverted Neopets were stolen from users by others who used them in both on and offsite transactions and sold for real money. This black market had reportedly existed for years without intervention until 2024. In January 2024, &quot;Neopets&quot; announced the launch of the Styling Studio and Style Tokens. By using NeoCash, users can purchase Styling Studio Supplies which can then be used to obtain Style Tokens. These tokens allow for the toggling and use of old and alternative pet art.

===Community===
&quot;Neopets&quot; has a community for users to chat with and contact other users. Each user has their own profile they can edit with HTML and CSS and are represented by avatars provided by the website, as users cannot upload their own. Most avatars must be &quot;unlocked&quot; by completing certain in-game tasks, such as winning a contest or getting a high score on a game.

Users may request other users to be &quot;Neofriends&quot; or block other users from contacting them. To comply with COPPA, users under 13 years of age cannot access any of the site&#x27;s communication features without sending in parental consent via fax. The main features include:

* NeoMail, a personal in-game communication system like regular email. Users can write messages to other users and restrict who can contact them through NeoMail.
* Neoboards, public discussion boards for on-topic discussions. Users can enter their own &quot;neoHTML&quot;, a restricted form of BBCode, to customise their posts and signatures.
* Guilds, groups of users with similar interests and their own message board.

Discussions through these features are restricted and may not involve topics such as dating and romance or controversial topics like politics and religion. Continuous moderation is performed by paid &quot;Neopets&quot; staff members, and users can help moderate the site by reporting messages they believe are inappropriate or offensive. Messages are also automatically filtered to prevent users from posting messages with profanity or lewd content.

==Reception==
Described as an online cross of &quot;Pokémon&quot; and &quot;Tamagotchi&quot;, &quot;Neopets&quot; has received both praise and criticism. It has been praised for having educational content. Children can learn HTML to edit their own pages. They can also learn how to handle money by participating in the economy. Reviews from About.com and MMO Hut considered the multitude of possible activities a positive aspect. Most of the users are female, higher than in other massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) but equivalent to social-networking-driven communities. Lucy Bradshaw, a vice president of Electronic Arts, attributes the popularity among girls to the openness of the site and said, &quot;Games that have a tendency to satisfy on more than one dimension have a tendency to have a broader appeal and attract girls&quot;.

Luck &amp; chance games draw criticism from parents as they introduce children to gambling. In Australia, a cross-promotion with McDonald&#x27;s led to controversy with &quot;Neopets&quot;&#x27; luck/chance games in October 2004. Australian tabloid television show &quot;Today Tonight&quot; featured a nine-year-old boy who claimed the site requires one to gamble in order to earn enough Neopoints to feed one&#x27;s Neopet or else it would be sent to the pound. While gambling is not required, nor are pets sent to the pound if unfed, the website includes games of chance based on real games such as blackjack and lottery scratchcards. After this incident, &quot;Neopets&quot; prohibited users under the age of 13 from playing Neopets&#x27;s casino-style games.

===Immersive advertising===

Immersive advertising is a trademarked term for the way &quot;Neopets&quot; displayed advertisements to generate profit after Doug Dohring bought the site. Unlike pop-up and banner ads, immersive ads integrate advertisements into the site&#x27;s content in interactive forms, including games and items. Players could earn Neopoints from them by playing advergames and taking part in online marketing surveys. Prior to the arrival of the NC Mall, it contributed to 60% of the revenue from the site with paying Fortune 1000 companies including Disney, General Mills, and McDonald&#x27;s.

It was a contentious issue with the site with regard to the ethics of marketing to children. It drew criticism from parents, psychologists, and consumer advocates who argued that children may not know that they are being advertised to, as it blurred the line between site content and advertisement. Children under eight had difficulty recognizing ads and half a million of the 25 million users were under the age of eight in 2005. Dohring responded to such criticism stating that of the 40 percent of users twelve and younger, very few were seven or eight years old and that preschoolers were not their target audience.

Others criticised the functionality of the site. Susan Linn, another psychologist and author of &quot;Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood&quot; considered the purpose of this site was to keep children in front of advertisements. Kalle Lasn, editor-in-chief and co-founder of &quot;Adbusters&quot; magazine, said the site encouraged kids to spend hours in front of a screen and recruited them to consumerism. &quot;Neopets&quot; executives stated that paid content constituted less than 1% of the site&#x27;s total content. Children were not required to play or use sponsor games and items, and all ads were marked as such.

=== Customer security ===
In July 2009, it was reported that the &quot;Neopets&quot; site was the target of an identity theft scheme that attempted to trick users into clicking a link that would install malware onto the user&#x27;s computer. According to reports, the scheme was aimed not at child players&#x27; &quot;Neopets&quot; accounts, but at using the malware to steal the financial data and identities of their parents. Viacom stated that it was investigating the issue, and that the reports referred to a version of social engineering rather than an &quot;indictment of Neopets security practices&quot;. In an on-site newsletter, &quot;Neopets&quot; claimed that the site&#x27;s security measures prevented the posting of such links.

In 2016, Motherboard reported that the account information of an alleged 70 million of Neopets accounts had been compromised. The hack contained usernames, passwords, email addresses, birth dates, gender, and country from 2012 (prior to JumpStart&#x27;s acquisition), but did not contain credit card information or physical addresses. Neopets responded by sending emails to all affected players.

On 20 July 2022, Neopets confirmed that it had suffered a data breach the day prior. The data breach exposed Neopets&#x27; entire database schema, including usernames, emails and passwords of its 69 million users. Neopets responded by forcing a password reset for all users on 1 August 2022, causing some players to be locked out as they no longer had access to the e-mail addresses linked to their accounts. On 29 August 2022 Neopets sent an e-mail to users detailing the results of their subsequent investigation.

==Merchandise==
The popularity of &quot;Neopets&quot; spawned real-world merchandise including clothing, jewelry, stickers, books, cereals, video games and more, sold at mainstream outlets and online retailers. &quot;Neopets&quot; merchandise often contains a code which can be redeemed on the site for an in-game reward. In 2003, Doug Dohring said that &quot;Neopets&quot; had always planned to &quot;bring the online and offline worlds together in ways that have never been done before&quot;.

Neopets, Inc. signed various licensing deals with companies such as Viacom Consumer Products, Thinkway Toys, and Jakks Pacific over the years. &quot;Neopets: The Official Magazine&quot; was a bi-monthly magazine launched in September 2003; it was replaced in 2008 by &quot;Beckett Plushie Pals&quot;, which featured &quot;Neopets&quot; news as well as other companies&#x27; products such as Webkinz. Wizards of the Coast released the &quot;Neopets Trading Card Game&quot; in September 2003, which was promoted in three of General Mills &quot;Big G&quot; cereals and ten Simon Property Group malls. It received two different nominations for &quot;Toy of the Year&quot; as well as other recognitions before being discontinued in 2006. In June 2024, Upper Deck Company released a new trading card game called the &quot;Neopets Battledome Trading Card Game&quot;.

In 2005, it was announced that a &quot;Neopets&quot; feature film was in production. It was to be written by Rob Lieber and produced by Dylan Sellers and John A. Davis for Warner Bros., but the project was later cancelled. On 10 February 2020, Blue Ant Media&#x27;s Beach House Pictures announced that a &quot;Neopets&quot; animated television series was in development and was set to air in 2021, though there have been no recent updates.

=== Video games ===

In 2005, &quot;Neopets&quot; expanded to video game deals. Two video games were released by Sony Computer Entertainment, &quot;&quot; for the PlayStation 2 in 2005 and &quot;&quot; for the PlayStation Portable in 2006. In 2007, MumboJumbo developed the match-3 PC game &quot;Neopets: Codestone Quest&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Neopets Puzzle Adventure&quot; was released for Nintendo DS, Wii, and PC. The following year, the handheld game &quot;Neopets: Quizara&#x27;s Curse&quot; was released for the LeapFrog Didj. In August 2011, &quot;Neopets&quot; launched the tie-in game &quot;Treasure Keepers&quot; on Facebook, but it was discontinued in December of that year.

A number of &quot;Neopets&quot; mobile games for Android and iOS have also been released. In 2015, &quot;Neopets&quot; released the match-3 game &quot;Ghoul Catchers&quot;. In 2019, &quot;Neopets&quot; released the puzzle game &quot;Legends and Letters&quot;. Both &quot;Ghoul Catchers&quot; and &quot;Legends and Letters&quot; were discontinued in May 2020. In May 2022, &quot;Neopets&quot; released the construction simulation game &quot;Island Builders&quot;. In December 2022, &quot;Neopets&quot; released the match-3 game &quot;Faerie&#x27;s Hope&quot;. In Spring 2024, &quot;Island Builders&quot; was relaunched under the new name &quot;Tales of Dacardia&quot;.

<doc id="22018" wikidata="Q23197" url="?curid=22018" title="Nashville, Tennessee">
<text>Nashville, often known as Music City, is the capital and most populous city in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It is the seat of Davidson County in Middle Tennessee, located on the Cumberland River. Nashville had a population of 689,447 at the 2020 census, making it the 21st-most populous city in the United States and the fourth-most populous city in the Southeast. The city is the center of the Nashville metropolitan area, home to 2.1 million people, and is among the fastest growing cities in the nation. 

Named for Francis Nash, a general of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, the city was founded in 1779 when this territory was still considered part of North Carolina. The city grew quickly due to its strategic location as a port on the Cumberland River and, in the 19th century, a railroad center. Nashville as part of Tennessee seceded during the American Civil War; in 1862 it was the first state capital in the Confederacy to be taken by Union forces. It was occupied through the war. After the war, the city gradually reclaimed its stature. It became a center of trade and developed a manufacturing base.

Since 1963, Nashville has had a consolidated city-county government, which includes six smaller municipalities in a two-tier system. The city is governed by a mayor, a vice-mayor, and a 40-member metropolitan council. Some 35 of the members are elected from single-member districts, while five are elected at-large. Reflecting the city&#x27;s position in state government, Nashville is home to the Tennessee Supreme Court&#x27;s courthouse for Middle Tennessee, one of the state&#x27;s three divisions.

As of 2020, Nashville is considered a global city, type &quot;Gamma&quot; by the GaWC. The city is a major center for the music industry, especially country music. It is home to three major professional sports teams: the Predators, Titans, and Nashville SC. The city is also the home of many colleges and universities including Tennessee State University, Vanderbilt University, Belmont University, Fisk University, Trevecca Nazarene University, and Lipscomb University. Nashville is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Athens of the South&quot; due to the large number of educational institutions. The city is also a major center for the healthcare, publishing, banking, automotive, and technology industries. Entities with headquarters in the city include AllianceBernstein, Asurion, Bridgestone Americas, Captain D&#x27;s, Concord, Gideons International, Hospital Corporation of America, LifeWay Christian Resources, Logan&#x27;s Roadhouse, and Ryman Hospitality Properties.

==History==

===18th and 19th centuries===
In 1689, French-Canadian trader Martin Chartier established a trading post on the Cumberland River, near the present-day site of the city. In 1714, a group of French traders under the command of Charles Charleville established a settlement and trading post at the present location of downtown Nashville, which became known as French Lick. These settlers quickly established an extensive fur trading network with the local Native Americans, but by the 1740s the settlement had largely been abandoned.

In 1779, explorers James Robertson and John Donelson led a party of Overmountain Men to the site of French Lick, and constructed Fort Nashborough. It was named for Francis Nash, the American Revolutionary War hero. Nashville quickly grew because of its strategic location as a port on the Cumberland River, a tributary of the Ohio River; and its later status as a major railroad center. By 1800, the city had 345 residents, including 136 enslaved African Americans and 14 free African Americans. In 1806, Nashville was incorporated as a city and became the county seat of Davidson County, Tennessee. In 1843, the city was named as the permanent capital of the state of Tennessee. Knoxville, Kingston &amp; Murfreesboro were prior locations of the state capital.

The city government of Nashville owned 24 slaves by 1831, and 60 prior to the Civil War. They were &quot;put to work to build the first successful water system and maintain the streets.&quot; Auction blocks and brokers&#x27; offices were part of the slave market at the heart of the city. It was the center of plantations cultivating tobacco and hemp as commodity crops, in addition to the breeding and training of thoroughbred horses, and other livestock. For years Nashville was considered one of the wealthiest southern capitals and a large portion of its prominence was from the iron business. Nashville led the south for iron production.

The cholera epidemic that struck Nashville in 1849–1850 took the life of former U.S. President James K. Polk and resulted in high fatalities. There were 311 deaths from cholera in 1849 and an estimated 316 to about 500 in 1850.

Before the Civil War, about 700 free Blacks lived in small enclaves in northern Nashville. More than 3,200 enslaved African Americans lived in the city. By 1860, when the first rumblings of secession began to be heard across the South, antebellum Nashville was a prosperous city.

The city&#x27;s significance as a shipping port and rail center made it a desirable prize for competing military forces that wanted to control the region&#x27;s important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first Confederate state capital to fall to U.S. troops, and the state was occupied by the U.S. Army for the duration of the war. Many enslaved African Americans from Middle Tennessee fled as refugees to Union lines; they were housed in contraband camps around military installations in Nashville&#x27;s eastern, western, and southern borders. The Battle of Nashville (December 15–16, 1864) was a significant Union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war; it was also the war&#x27;s final major military action in which Tennessee regiments played a large part on both sides of the battle. Afterward, the Confederates conducted a war of attrition, making guerrilla raids and engaging in small skirmishes. Confederate forces in the Deep South were almost constantly in retreat.

In 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War, the Nashville chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded by Confederate veteran John W. Morton. He was reported to have initiated General Nathan Bedford Forrest into the white-supremacist organization. The latter became Grand Wizard of the organization, which had chapters of this secret, insurgent group forming throughout the state and across the South. They opposed voting and political organizing by freedmen, tried to control their behavior by threats, violence and murder, and sometimes also attacked their White allies, including schoolteachers from the North and Freedman&#x27;s Bureau officials.

Whites directed violence against freedmen and their descendants both during and after the Reconstruction era. Two freedmen, David Jones and Jo Reed, were lynched in Nashville by White mobs in 1872 and 1875, respectively. Reed was hanged from a bridge over the river, but survived after the rope broke and he fell into the water. He successfully escaped the city soon thereafter.

In the aftermath of the Civil War, the Fisk Jubilee Singers of Fisk University in Nashville emerged as a beacon of hope and cultural pride. By 1871, this ensemble began touring the U.S. and Europe, earning international acclaim for their performances of Negro spirituals. Their success not only provided vital funding for their university but also marked Nashville as a significant center for African American music and culture, laying the groundwork for the city&#x27;s enduring musical legacy.

In 1873, Nashville suffered another cholera epidemic, along with towns throughout Sumner County along railroad routes and the Cumberland River. This was part of a larger epidemic that struck the Mississippi Valley system and other areas of the United States, such as New York and towns along its major lakes and rivers. The epidemic is estimated to have killed around 1,000 people in Nashville, and 50,000 total.
Meanwhile, the city had reclaimed its important shipping and trading position and developed a solid manufacturing base. The post–Civil War years of the late 19th century brought new prosperity to Nashville and Davidson County. Wealthy planters and businessmen built grand, classical-style buildings. A replica of the Parthenon was constructed in Centennial Park, near downtown.

On April 30, 1892, Ephraim Grizzard, an African-American man, was lynched in a spectacle murder in front of a white mob of 10,000 in Nashville. He was a suspect in the assault of two white sisters. His lynching was described by journalist Ida B. Wells as: &quot;A naked, bloody example of the blood-thirstiness of the nineteenth century civilization of the Athens of the South.&quot; His brother, Henry Grizzard, had been lynched and hanged on April 24, 1892, in nearby Goodlettsville as a suspect in the same assault incident. From 1877 to 1950, a total of six lynchings of Blacks were conducted in Davidson County, four before the turn of the century.

===Earlier 20th century===

By the turn of the century Nashville was home to numerous organizations and individuals associated with revisionist Lost Cause of the Confederacy pseudohistory, and it has been referred to as the &quot;cradle of the Lost Cause.&quot; In 1893, the magazine &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot; began publication in the city. In 1894, the first chapter of United Daughters of the Confederacy was founded in the city, and it hosted the first two conventions of the organization. Prominent proponents of the mythology, the so-called &quot;guardians of the Lost Cause,&quot; were concentrated Downtown and in the West End, near Centennial Park.

At the same time, Jefferson Street became the historic center of the African American community, with similar districts developing in the Black neighborhoods in East and North Nashville. In 1912, the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial and Normal School was moved to Jefferson Street. The first Prince&#x27;s Hot Chicken Shack originated at the corner of Jefferson Street and 28th Avenue in 1945. Jefferson Street became a destination for jazz and blues musicians, and remained so until the federal government split the area by construction of Interstate 40 in the late 1960s.

In 1925, the establishment of the Grand Ole Opry marked the beginning of Nashville&#x27;s journey as the &#x27;Country Music Capital of the World&#x27;, drawing musicians and fans alike to the city and setting the stage for its future as a country music powerhouse.

In 1950, the state legislature approved a new city charter that provided for the election of city council members from single-member districts, rather than at-large voting. This change was supported because at-large voting required candidates to gain a majority of votes from across the city. The previous system prevented the minority population, which then tended to support Republican candidates, from being represented by candidates of their choice; apportionment under single-member districts meant that some districts in Nashville had Black majorities. In 1951, after passage of the new charter, African American attorneys Z. Alexander Looby and Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council.

During the mid-1950s, Nashville underwent a musical transformation with the emergence of the &#x27;Nashville Sound,&#x27; which was characterized by &quot;smooth strings and choruses&quot;, &quot;sophisticated background vocals&quot; and &quot;smooth tempos&quot; associated with traditional pop. The new sound broadened country music&#x27;s appeal and solidified Nashville&#x27;s status as a music recording and production center.

With the United States Supreme Court ruling in 1954 that public schools had to desegregate with &quot;all deliberate speed&quot;, the family of student Robert Kelley filed a lawsuit in 1956, arguing that Nashville administrators should open all-White East High School to him. A similar case was filed by Reverend Henry Maxwell due to his children having to take a 45-minute bus ride from South Nashville to the north end of the city. These suits caused the courts to announce what became known as the &quot;Nashville Plan&quot;, where the city&#x27;s public schools would desegregate one grade per year beginning in the fall of 1957.

Urban redevelopment accelerated over the next several decades, and the city grew increasingly segregated. An interstate was placed on the edge of East Nashville while another highway was built through Edgehill, a lower-income, predominantly minority community.

===Postwar development to present===
Rapid suburbanization occurred during the years immediately after World War II, as new housing was being built outside city limits. This resulted in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities, which the county found difficult to provide. At the same time, suburbanization led to a declining tax base in the city, although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services that were supported financially only by city taxpayers. After years of discussion, a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating city and county government. It failed to gain approval although it was supported by the then-elected leaders of both jurisdictions, County Judge Beverly Briley and Mayor Ben West.

Following the referendum&#x27;s failure, Nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base. This increased uncertainty among residents, and created resentment among many suburban communities. Under the second charter for metropolitan government, which was approved in 1962, two levels of service provision were proposed: the General Services District and the Urban Services District, to provide for a differential in tax levels. Residents of the Urban Services District had a full range of city services. The areas that made up the General Services District, however, had a lower tax rate until full services were provided. This helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region.

In the early 1960s, Tennessee still had racial segregation of public facilities, including lunch counters and department store fitting rooms. Hotels and restaurants were also segregated. Between February 13 and May 10, 1960, a series of sit-ins were organized at lunch counters in downtown Nashville by the Nashville Student Movement and Nashville Christian Leadership Council, and were part of a broader sit-in movement in the southeastern United States as part of an effort to end racial segregation of public facilities. On April 19, 1960, the house of Z. Alexander Looby, an African American attorney and council member, was bombed by segregationists. Protesters marched to the city hall the next day. Mayor Ben West said he supported the desegregation of lunch counters, which civil rights activists had called for.

In 1963, Nashville consolidated its government with Davidson County, forming a metropolitan government. The membership on the Metro Council, the legislative body, was increased from 21 to 40 seats. Of these, five members are elected at-large and 35 are elected from single-member districts, each to serve a term of four years.

As Nashville evolved in the 1960s, its music scene diversified, welcoming rock, pop, and other genres and the &#x27;Nashville Sound&#x27; transformed into &#x27;Countrypolitan&#x27;. Artists like Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash came to Nashville to record, reflecting the city&#x27;s expanding influence in the music industry. In 1960, &quot;Time&quot; reported that Nashville had &quot;nosed out Hollywood as the nation&#x27;s second biggest (after New York) record-producing center.&quot;

In 1957 Nashville desegregated its school system using an innovative grade a year plan, in response to a class action suit &quot;Kelly vs. Board of Education of Nashville&quot;. By 1966 the Metro Council abandoned the grade a year plan and completely desegregated the entire school system at one time.

Congress passed civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965, but tensions continued as society was slow to change. On April 8, 1967, a riot broke out on the college campuses of Fisk University and Tennessee State University, historically Black colleges, after Stokely Carmichael spoke about Black Power at Vanderbilt University. Although it was viewed as a &quot;race riot&quot;, it had classist characteristics.

In 1979, the Ku Klux Klan burnt crosses outside two African American sites in Nashville, including the city headquarters of the NAACP.

Historically, Nashville zoning permitted the construction of duplex housing. In the 1980s and 1990s, Nashville lawmakers downzoned sections of Nashville to exclusively permit single-family housing. Proponents of these downzonings said they would raise home values.

Since the 1970s, the city and county have undergone tremendous growth, particularly during the economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of then-Mayor and later-Tennessee Governor, Phil Bredesen. Making urban renewal a priority, Bredesen fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, the downtown Nashville Public Library, the Bridgestone Arena, and Nissan Stadium.

Nissan Stadium (formerly Adelphia Coliseum and LP Field) was built after the National Football League&#x27;s (NFL) Houston Oilers agreed to move to the city in 1995. The NFL team debuted in Nashville in 1998 at Vanderbilt Stadium, and Nissan Stadium opened in the summer of 1999. The Oilers changed their name to the Tennessee Titans and finished the season with the Music City Miracle and a close Super Bowl game. The St. Louis Rams won in the last play of the game.

In 1997, Nashville was awarded a National Hockey League expansion team; this was named the Nashville Predators. Since the 2003–04 season, the Predators have made the playoffs in all but four seasons. In 2017, they made the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history, but ultimately fell to the Pittsburgh Penguins, 4games to 2, in the best-of-seven series.

===21st century===

On January 22, 2009, residents rejected Nashville Charter Amendment 1, which sought to make English the official language of the city.

Between May 1 and 7, 2010, much of Nashville was extensively flooded as part of a series of 1,000 year floods throughout Middle and West Tennessee. Much of the flooding took place in areas along the Cumberland and Harpeth Rivers and Mill Creek, and caused extensive damage to the many buildings and structures in the city, including the Grand Ole Opry House, Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center, Opry Mills Mall, Schermerhorn Symphony Center, Bridgestone Arena, and Nissan Stadium. Sections of Interstate 24 and Briley Parkway were also flooded. Eleven people died in the Nashville area as a result of the flooding, and damages were estimated to be over $2 billion.

The city recovered after the Great Recession. In March 2012, a Gallup poll ranked Nashville in the top five regions for job growth. In 2013, Nashville was described as &quot;Nowville&quot; and &quot;It City&quot; by &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Nashville elected its first female mayor, Megan Barry, on September 25, 2015. As a council member, Barry had officiated at the city&#x27;s first same-sex wedding on June 26, 2015.

In 2017, Nashville&#x27;s economy was deemed the third fastest-growing in the nation, and the city was named the &quot;hottest housing market in the US&quot; by Freddie Mac realtors. In May 2017, census estimates showed Nashville had passed Memphis to become most populated city in Tennessee. Nashville has also made national headlines for its &quot;homelessness crisis&quot;. Rising housing prices and the opioid crisis have resulted in more people being out on the streets: , between 2,300 and 20,000 Nashvillians are homeless.

On March 6, 2018, due to felony charges filed against Mayor Barry relating to the misuse of public funds, she resigned before the end of her term. A special election was called. Following a ruling by the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Davidson County Election Commission set the special election for May 24, 2018, to meet the requirement of 75 to 80 days from the date of resignation. David Briley, who was Vice Mayor during the Barry administration and Acting Mayor after her resignation, won the special election with just over 54% of the vote, becoming the 70th mayor of Nashville.

On May 1, 2018, voters rejected Let&#x27;s Move Nashville, a referendum which would have funded construction of an $8.9 billion mass transit system under the Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority (now WeGo Public Transit) by a 2 to 1 margin.

On September 28, 2019, John Cooper became the ninth mayor of Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.

On March 3, 2020, a tornado tracked west to east, just north of the downtown Nashville area, killing at least 25 people and leaving tens of thousands without electricity. Neighborhoods impacted included North Nashville, Germantown, East Nashville, Donelson, and Hermitage.

On December 25, 2020, a vehicle exploded on Second Avenue, killing the perpetrator and injuring eight others.

On March 27, 2023, a gunman killed three children and three staff at the Covenant School, before getting killed by police.

On December 9, 2023, tornadoes caused considerable destruction and left three people dead.

==Geography==
===Topography===

Nashville lies on the Cumberland River in the northwestern portion of the Nashville Basin. Nashville&#x27;s elevation ranges from its lowest point, above sea level at the Cumberland River, to its highest point, above sea level in the Radnor Lake State Natural Area. Nashville also sits at the start of the Highland Rim, a geophysical region of very hilly land. Because of this, Nashville is very hilly. Nashville also has some stand alone hills around the city such as the hill on which the Tennessee State Capitol building sits. 

The higher elevations of the Highland Rim encircle the Nashville Basin with the Eastern and Western Highland Rim portions being the largest expanses. Part of the Western Highland Rim slopes down and wraps the hills along the western flanks of the city in a contiguous forest thought to be one of the largest of such forest habitats in Middle Tennessee. Nashville&#x27;s Highland Rim Forest connects Beaman Park, Bells Bend Park, Warner Parks, and Radnor Lake State Park. 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which of it is land and of it (4.53%) is water.

===Cityscape===
Nashville&#x27;s downtown area features a diverse assortment of entertainment, dining, cultural and architectural attractions. The Broadway and 2nd Avenue areas feature entertainment venues, night clubs and an assortment of restaurants. North of Broadway lie Nashville&#x27;s central business district, Legislative Plaza, Capitol Hill and the Tennessee Bicentennial Mall. Cultural and architectural attractions can be found throughout the city.

Three major interstate highways (I-40, I-65 and I-24) converge near the core area of downtown, and many regional cities are within a day&#x27;s driving distance.

Nashville&#x27;s first skyscraper, the Life &amp; Casualty Tower, was completed in 1957 and launched the construction of other high rises in downtown Nashville. After the construction of the AT&amp;T Building (commonly referred to by locals as the &quot;Batman Building&quot;) in 1994, the downtown area saw little construction until the mid-2000s. The Pinnacle, a high rise office building which opened in 2010, was the first skyscraper in Nashville to be built in the preceding 15 years.

Since 2000, Nashville has seen two urban construction booms (one prior to the Great Recession and the other after) that have yielded multiple high-rises (defined by Emporis as buildings of a minimum of 115 feet tall). Of the city&#x27;s 33 towers of 300 feet tall or taller (as of April 2023), 24 have been completed since 2000. Of note, Nashville has a disproportionate number of buildings 300 feet and taller in relation to its overall metropolitan statistical area (MSA) population of about 2 million (2021 U.S. Census Bureau estimate). This is due, in part, to the tourism-centric city&#x27;s multiple hotel towers and to many condominium towers having multiple unit owners who also own other residential properties in both Nashville and in other markets. In contrast, and for comparison, Phoenix, with an MSA population of about 4.95 million (2021 estimate) offered 21 buildings of 300 feet and taller (as of late 2024).

Many civic and infrastructure projects are being planned, in progress, or recently completed. A new MTA bus hub was recently completed in downtown Nashville, as was the Music City Star (now known as the WeGo Star) pilot project. Several public parks have been constructed, such as the Public Square. Riverfront Park is scheduled to be extensively updated. The Music City Center opened in May 2013. It is a convention center with of exhibit space.

===Flora===
Nashville, with 56% of the ground surface within its city limits covered in urban tree canopy, has the largest percentage of forested area of any other city in the U.S. With Nashville&#x27;s 320,000 total acres, this translates into over 170,000 wooded acres that may earn it the largest urban tree canopy by area, as well. The nearby city of Lebanon is notable and even named for its so-called &quot;cedar glades&quot;, which occur on soils too poor to support most trees and are instead dominated by Virginian juniper. Blackberry bushes, Virginia pine, loblolly pine, sassafras, red maple, river birch, American beech, river cane, mountain laurel and sycamore are all common native trees, along with many others.

In addition to the native forests, the combination of hot summers, abundant rainfall and mild winters permit a wide variety of both temperate and subtropical plants to be cultivated easily. Southern magnolia and cherry blossom trees are commonly cultivated here, with the city having an annual cherry blossom festival. Crepe myrtles and yew bushes are also commonly grown throughout Metro Nashville, and the winters are mild enough that sweetbay magnolia is evergreen whenever it is cultivated. The pansy flower is popular to plant during the autumn, and some varieties will flower overwinter in Nashville&#x27;s subtropical climate. However, many hot-weather plants like petunia and even papyrus thrive as annuals, and Japanese banana will die aboveground during winter but re-sprout after the danger of frost is over. Unbeknownst to most Tennesseans, even cold-hardy palms, particularly needle palm and dwarf palmetto, are grown uncommonly but often successfully, while the taller windmill palm is more marginal, perishing below about without protection. High desert plants like Colorado spruce and prickly pear cactus are also grown somewhat commonly, as are &quot;Yucca filamentosa&quot; and the trunking &quot;Yucca rostrata&quot;.

===Climate===

Nashville International Airport in Donelson has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Cf&quot;), with hot, humid summers and generally cool winters typical of the Upper South.

Snowfall occurs during the winter months, but it is usually not heavy. Average annual snowfall is about , falling mostly in January and February and occasionally in March, November and December. The largest snow event since 2003 was on January 22, 2016, when Nashville received of snow in a single storm; the largest overall was , received on March 17, 1892, during the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Snowstorm.

Rainfall is typically greater in solar spring (Feb-Apr) and summer (May-Jul), while the solar autumn months (Aug-Oct) are the driest on average. Spring and fall are prone to severe thunderstorms, which may bring tornadoes, large hail, flash floods and damaging wind, with recent major events on April 16, 1998; April 7, 2006; February 5, 2008; April 10, 2009; May 1–2, 2010; and March 3, 2020. Relative humidity in Nashville averages 83% in the mornings and 60% in the afternoons, which is considered moderate for the Southeastern United States. In recent decades, due to urban development, Nashville has developed an urban heat island; especially on cool, clear nights, temperatures are up to warmer in the heart of the city than in rural outlying areas. The Nashville region lies within USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a. From 1970 to 2020 the average summer temperature has risen 2.8 degrees F (1.5 C).

Nashville&#x27;s long springs and autumns combined with a diverse array of trees and grasses can often make it uncomfortable for allergy sufferers. In 2008, Nashville was ranked as the 26th-worst spring allergy city in the U.S. by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.

The coldest temperature ever officially recorded in Nashville was on January 21, 1985, and the hottest was on June 29, 2012. Nashville allegedly had a low of on January 26, 1832, but this was decades before record-keeping began and isn&#x27;t counted as the official record low.

====Donelson====
The mean annual temperature at Nashville International Airport is . Monthly averages range from in January to in July, with a diurnal temperature variation of . Diurnal temperature variation is highest in April and lowest in December, but it is also relatively high in October and relatively low in January. Donelson&#x27;s climate classifications are Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot; and Trewartha &quot;Cfak&quot; thanks to its hot summers (average over ), cool winters (average over ) and long (8+ months) growing seasons (average over ). Precipitation is abundant year-round without any major difference, but there is still slight variation. The wet season runs from February through July, reaching its zenith in May with 128 mm of rain. The dry season runs from August through January with an October nadir of 85 mm and secondary December peak of 113 mm.

====Old Hickory====
The mean annual temperature at Old Hickory Dam is . Monthly averages range from in January to in August, with a diurnal temperature variation of . Diurnal temperature variation is highest in April and lowest in January. Old Hickory&#x27;s climate classifications are Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot; and Trewartha &quot;Doak&quot; thanks to its hot summers (average over ), cool winters (average over ) and mediocre (4–7 months) growing seasons (average over ). Precipitation is abundant year-round without any major difference, but there is still slight variation. The wet season runs from February through July, reaching its zenith in April with 120 mm of rain. The dry season runs from August through January with an October/November nadir of 85 mm and secondary December peak of 113 mm. Data for record temperatures is spotty before June 2007 with another brief gap in data in January 2024, but temperatures in Old Hickory have been known to range from in January 1966 to in June and July 2012.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 689,447 people, 279,545 households, and 146,241 families residing in the city. The population increase of 88,225, or 14.67% over the 2010 figure of 601,222 residents, represented the largest net population increase in the city&#x27;s history. The population density was .

In 2010, there were 254,651 households and 141,469 families (55.6% of households). Of households with families, 37.2% had married couples living together, 14.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 4.2% had a male householder with no wife present. 27.9% of all households had children under the age of 18, and 18.8% had at least one member 65 years of age or older. Of the 44.4% of households that are non-families, 36.2% were individuals, and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.38 and the average family size was 3.16.

The age distribution was 22.2% under 18, 10.3% from 18 to 24, 32.8% from 25 to 44, 23.9% from 45 to 64, and 10.7% who were 65 or older. The median age was 34.2 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.7 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $46,141, and the median income for a family was $56,377.

About 13.9% of families and 18.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.5% of those under age 18 and 9.9% of those age 65 or over. Of residents 25 or older, 33.4% have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

Because of its relatively low cost of living and large job market, Nashville has become a popular city for immigrants. Nashville&#x27;s foreign-born population more than tripled in size between 1990 and 2000, increasing from 12,662 to 39,596. The city&#x27;s largest immigrant groups include Mexicans, Kurds, Vietnamese, Laotians, Arabs, and Somalis. There are also smaller communities of Pashtuns from Afghanistan and Pakistan concentrated primarily in Antioch. Nashville has the largest Kurdish community in the United States, numbering approximately 15,000. In 2009, about 60,000 Bhutanese refugees were being admitted to the U.S., and some were expected to resettle in Nashville. During the Iraqi election of 2005, Nashville was one of the few international locations where Iraqi expatriates could vote. The American Jewish community in Nashville dates back over 150 years, and numbered about 8,000 in 2015, plus 2,000 Jewish college students.

In 1779, approximately 20 percent of the settlers in Fort Nashborough were enslaved and free individuals of African descent. From this period until the Civil War, a burgeoning African American community in Nashville, under the guidance of a select few black leaders, diligently laid the groundwork for a prosperous society. They established educational institutions, places of worship, and enterprises, all contributing to the development and progress of the city.

===Metropolitan area===

, Nashville has the largest metropolitan area in the state of Tennessee, with a population of 2,014,444. The Nashville metropolitan area encompasses 13 of 41 Middle Tennessee counties: Cannon, Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Macon, Maury, Robertson, Rutherford, Smith, Sumner, Trousdale, Williamson, and Wilson. The 2020 population of the Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Columbia combined statistical area was 2,118,233.

=== Religion ===

In addition, the east bank park will include a river landing, providing people access to the river. In regard to the parks&#x27; benefits for Nashvillian civilians, Mayor Dean remarked that &quot;if done right, the thermal site can be an iconic park that generations of Nashvillians will be proud of and which they can enjoy&quot;. 
==Law and government==

The city of Nashville and Davidson County merged in 1963 as a way for Nashville to combat the problems of urban sprawl. The combined entity is officially known as &quot;the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County&quot;, and is popularly known as &quot;Metro Nashville&quot; or simply &quot;Metro&quot;. It offers services such as police, fire, electricity, water and sewage treatment. When the Metro government was formed in 1963, the government was split into two service districts—the &quot;urban services district&quot; and the &quot;general services district.&quot; The urban services district encompasses the 1963 boundaries of the former City of Nashville, approximately , and the general services district includes the remainder of Davidson County. There are six smaller municipalities within the consolidated city-county: Belle Meade, Berry Hill, Forest Hills, Oak Hill, Goodlettsville (partially), and Ridgetop (partially). These municipalities use a two-tier system of government, with the smaller municipality typically providing police services and the Metro Nashville government providing most other services. Previously, the city of Lakewood also had a separate charter. However, Lakewood residents voted in 2010 and 2011 to dissolve its city charter and join the metropolitan government, with both votes passing.

Nashville is governed by a mayor, vice-mayor, and 40-member Metropolitan Council. It uses the strong-mayor form of the mayor–council system. The current mayor of Nashville is Freddie O&#x27;Connell.

There are five council members who are elected at large and 35 council members that represent individual districts. The Metro Council has regular meetings that are presided over by the vice-mayor, who is currently Jim Shulman. The Metro Council meets on the first and third Tuesday of each month at 6:00pm, according to the Metropolitan Charter.

Nashville is home to the Tennessee Supreme Court&#x27;s courthouse for Middle Tennessee and the Estes Kefauver Federal Building and United States Courthouse, home of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.

===Politics===
Nashville has been a Democratic stronghold since at least the end of Reconstruction, and has remained staunchly Democratic even as the state as a whole has trended strongly Republican. Pockets of Republican influence exist in the wealthier portions of the city, but they are usually no match for the overwhelming Democratic trend in the rest of the city. The issue of school busing roiled politics for years but subsided after the 1990s. While local elections are officially nonpartisan, nearly all the city&#x27;s elected officials are publicly known as Democrats. The city is split among 10 state house districts, all of which are held by Democrats. Three state senate districts and part of a fourth are within the county; three are held by Democrats and one by a Republican.

In the state legislature, Nashville politicians serve as leaders of both the Senate and House Democratic Caucuses. Representative Mike Stewart serves as Chairman of the House Caucus. Senator Jeff Yarbro serves as Chairman of the Senate Caucus.

Democrats are no less dominant at the federal level. Democratic presidential candidates have failed to carry Davidson County only five times since Reconstruction; in 1928, 1968, 1972, 1984 and 1988. In most years, Democrats have carried Nashville at the presidential level with relatively little difficulty, even in years when they lose Tennessee as a whole. This has been especially true in recent elections, as the state capitol has continued to trend more Democratic even as most of the rest of the state has become staunchly Republican. In the 2000 presidential election, Tennessean Democrat Al Gore carried Nashville with over 59% of the vote even as he narrowly lost his home state and thus the presidency. In the 2004 election, Democrat John Kerry carried Nashville with 55% of the vote while George W. Bush won the state by 14 points. In 2008, Barack Obama carried Nashville with 60% of the vote while Republican John McCain won Tennessee by 15 points.

Nashville was in a single congressional district, the 5th, for most of its history. A Republican had not represented a significant portion of Nashville since 1874, until 2023 when the GOP-controlled state legislature controversially split Nashville into parts of the 5th, 6th, and 7th districts in a partisan gerrymander an additional Republican to Tennessee&#x27;s congressional delegation as part of the 2022 redistricting cycle. This Republican gerrymander ‘cracked’ the Democratic stronghold of Nashville across three otherwise Republican districts, ensuring three Republican representatives. This gerrymander ‘diminished the influence of Black voters and other voters of color concentrated in Nashville’, by splitting them up and adding portions of the Nashville community into districts that are overwhelmingly white and Republican, thus diluting the voting power of Black voters in the state.

Prior to this gerrymander, Republicans made a few spirited challenges to the 5th district in the mid-1960s and early 1970s, almost winning the district in 1968. The last serious bid for the district while still a Democratic stronghold was in 1972, when the Republican candidate gained 38% of the vote even as Nixon carried the district in the presidential election by a large margin. The district&#x27;s best-known congressman was probably Jo Byrns, who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and was Speaker of the House for much of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s first term as president. Another nationally prominent congressman from Nashville was Percy Priest, who represented the district from 1941 to 1956 and was House Majority Whip from 1949 to 1953. Former mayors Richard Fulton and Bill Boner also sat in the U.S. House before assuming the Metro mayoral office.

From 2003 to 2013, a sliver of southwestern Nashville was located in the 7th District, represented by Republican Marsha Blackburn. This area was roughly coextensive with the portion of Nashville she had represented in the state senate from 1998 to 2002. However, the 5th regained all of Nashville after the 2010 census.

===Crime===
According to the FBI&#x27;s Uniform Crime Reporting database, Metropolitan Nashville has a violent crime rate approximately three times the national average, and a property crime rate approximately 1.6 times the average. The following table shows Nashville&#x27;s crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants for seven UCR categories.

==Education==
The city is served by Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, also referred to as Metro Schools. This district is the second largest school district in Tennessee, and enrolls approximately 85,000 students at 169 schools. In addition, Nashville is home to numerous private schools, including Montgomery Bell Academy, Harpeth Hall School, University School of Nashville, Lipscomb Academy, The Ensworth School, Christ Presbyterian Academy, Father Ryan High School, Pope John Paul II High School, Franklin Road Academy, Davidson Academy, Nashville Christian School, Donelson Christian Academy, and St. Cecilia Academy. Combined, all of the private schools in Nashville enroll more than 15,000 students.
===Colleges and universities===

Nashville has been labeled the &quot;Athens of the South&quot; due to the many colleges and universities in the metropolitan area. Total enrollment in post-secondary education in Nashville is around 43,000.

The largest is Vanderbilt University, with about 13,000 students. Vanderbilt is considered one of the nation&#x27;s leading research universities and is particularly known for its medical, law, and education programs.

Nashville is home to more historically Black institutions of higher education than any other city save for Atlanta, Georgia: Fisk University, Tennessee State University, Meharry Medical College, and American Baptist College.

Other schools based in Nashville include Belmont University, Lipscomb University, Trevecca Nazarene University, and John A. Gupton College. The Tennessee Board of Regents operates Nashville State Community College and the Nashville branch of the Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology.

Other nearby institutes of higher education include Murfreesboro&#x27;s Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) and Clarksville&#x27;s Austin Peay University, both full-sized public university with Tennessee&#x27;s second- and eighth-largest undergraduate populations, respectively; Daymar College in Franklin; and Cumberland University in Lebanon.

==Media==

The daily newspaper in Nashville is &quot;The Tennessean&quot;, which until 1998 competed with the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;, another daily paper that was housed in the same building under a joint-operating agreement. &quot;The Tennessean&quot; is the city&#x27;s most widely circulated newspaper. Online news service &quot;NashvillePost.com&quot; competes with the printed dailies to break local and state news. Several weekly papers are also published in Nashville, including &quot;The Nashville Pride&quot;, &quot;Nashville Business Journal&quot;, &quot;Nashville Scene&quot; and &quot;The Tennessee Tribune&quot;. Historically, &quot;The Tennessean&quot; was associated with a broadly liberal editorial policy, while &quot;The Banner&quot; carried staunchly conservative views in its editorial pages; &quot;The Banner&quot;&#x27;s heritage had been carried on, to an extent, by &quot;The City Paper&quot; which folded in August 2013 after having been founded in October 2000. The &quot;Nashville Scene&quot; is the area&#x27;s alternative weekly broadsheet. &quot;The Nashville Pride&quot; is aimed towards community development and serves Nashville&#x27;s entrepreneurial population. &quot;Nashville Post&quot; is an online news source covering business, politics and sports.

Nashville is home to eleven broadcast television stations, although most households are served by direct cable network connections. Comcast Cable has a monopoly on terrestrial cable service in Davidson County (but not throughout the entire media market). Nashville is ranked as the 26th largest television market in the United States. Major stations include WKRN-TV 2 (ABC), WSMV-TV 4 (NBC), WTVF 5 (CBS), WNPT 8 (PBS), WTNX-LD 15 (Telemundo), WZTV 17 (Fox, with The CW on DT2), WNPX-TV 28 (ion), WPGD-TV 50 (TBN), WLLC-LD 42 (Univision), WUXP-TV 30 (MyNetworkTV), (WJFB) 44 (MeTV), and WNAB 58 (Dabl).

Nashville is also home to cable networks Country Music Television (CMT) and RFD-TV, among others. CMT&#x27;s master control facilities are located in New York City with other Viacom properties. The Top 20 Countdown and CMT Insider are taped in their Nashville studios. Shop at Home Network was once based in Nashville, but the channel signed off in 2008.

Several FM and AM radio stations broadcast in the Nashville area, including five college stations and one LPFM community radio station. Nashville is ranked as the 39th largest radio market in the United States. WSM-FM is owned by Cumulus Media and is 95.5 FM. WSM-AM, owned by Gaylord Entertainment Company, is based on the Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center. WSM is famous for carrying live broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry, through which it helped spread the popularity of country music in America, and continues to broadcast country music throughout its broadcast day. WLAC, whose over-the-air signal is heard at 1510 AM, is an iHeartMedia-owned talk station which was originally sponsored by the Life and Casualty Insurance Company of Tennessee, and its competitor WWTN is owned by Cumulus.

Several major motion pictures have been filmed in Nashville, including &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, “The Matrix”, &quot;The Last Castle&quot;, &quot;Gummo&quot;, “Starman”, &quot;The Thing Called Love&quot;, &quot;Two Weeks&quot;, &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;Nashville&quot;, and &quot;Country Strong&quot;, as well as the ABC television series &quot;Nashville&quot;.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 78.1% of working Nashville residents commuted by driving alone, 9.8% carpooled, 2% used public transportation, and 2.2% walked. About 1.1% used all other forms of transportation, including taxicab, motorcycle, and bicycle. About 6.7% of working Nashville residents worked at home. In 2015, 7.9% of city of Nashville households were without a car; this figure decreased to 5.9% in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Nashville averaged 1.72 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.

====Highways====
Nashville is centrally located at the crossroads of three Interstate Highways, I-40 (east-west), I-24 (northwest-southeast) and I-65 (north-south). I-40 connects the city between Memphis to the west and Knoxville to the east, I-24 connects between Clarksville to the northwest and Chattanooga to the southeast, and I-65 connects between Louisville to the north and Huntsville to the south. All three of these interstate highways, which also serve the suburbs, form brief concurrencies with each other in the city, and completely encircle downtown. I-440 is a bypass route connecting I-40, I-65, and I-24 south of Downtown Nashville. Briley Parkway, the majority of which is a freeway, forms a bypass around the north side of the city and its interstates. Ellington Parkway, a freeway made up of a section of US 31E, runs between east of downtown and Briley Parkway, serving as an alternative route to I-65. I-840 provides an outer southern bypass for the city and its suburbs. U.S. Routes 31, 31E, 31W, 31 Alternate, 41, 41 Alternate, 70, 70S, and 431 also serve Nashville, intersecting in the city&#x27;s center as arterial surface roads and radiating outward. Most of these routes are called &quot;pikes&quot; and many carry the names of nearby towns to which they lead. Among these are Clarksville Pike, Gallatin Pike, Lebanon Pike, Murfreesboro Pike, Nolensville Pike, and Franklin Pike.

====Public transit====

WeGo Public Transit provides bus transit within the city. Routes utilize a hub and spoke method, centered around the Music City Central transit station in downtown. A rejected expansion plan included use of bus rapid transit and light rail service at some point in the future. A subsequent expansion plan focused on improving sidewalks, adding smart signals, upgrading bus stops and transit centers, implementing a 24-hour bus service and adding 54 miles of high-capacity transit corridors was passed in 2024.

Nashville is considered a gateway city for rail and air traffic for the Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion.

====Air====

The city is served by Nashville International Airport (BNA), which is operated by the Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA). Nearly 23 million passengers visited the airport in 2023, making it the 29th busiest airport in the US. BNA is ranked the fastest growing airport among the top 50 airports in the United States. Nashville International Airport serves 600 daily flights to more than 100 nonstop markets.

In late 2014, BNA became the first major U.S. airport to establish dedicated pick-up and drop-off areas for vehicle for hire companies.

The airport authority also operates the John C. Tune Airport, a Class E airspace general aviation airport.

====Intercity rail====

Although a major freight hub for CSX Transportation, Nashville is not currently served by Amtrak, the third-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. to have this distinction. Nashville&#x27;s Union Station had once been a major intercity passenger rail center for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad; Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway; and the Tennessee Central Railway, reaching Midwestern cities and cities on the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. However, by the time of Amtrak&#x27;s founding, service had been cut back to a single train, the &quot;Floridian&quot;, which ran from Chicago to Miami and St. Petersburg, Florida. It served Union Station until its cancellation on October 9, 1979, due to poor track conditions resulting in late trains and low ridership, ending over 120 years of intercity rail service in Nashville.

While there have been few proposals to restore Amtrak service to Nashville, there have been repeated calls from residents. In addition to scarce federal funding, Tennessee state officials do not believe that Nashville is large enough to support intercity rail. &quot;It would be wonderful to say I can be in Memphis and jump on a train to Nashville, but the volume of people who would do that isn&#x27;t anywhere close to what the cost would be to provide the service,&quot; said Ed Cole, chief of environment and planning with the Tennessee Department of Transportation. Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, said rail trips would catch on if routes were expanded, but conceded that it would be nearly impossible to resume Amtrak service to Nashville without a substantial investment from the state. However, in 2020, Amtrak indicated it was considering a service that would run from Atlanta to Nashville by way of Chattanooga.

Nashville launched a passenger commuter rail system called the Music City Star (now the WeGo Star) on September 18, 2006. The only currently operational leg of the system connects the city of Lebanon to downtown Nashville at the Nashville Riverfront station. Legs to Clarksville, Murfreesboro and Gallatin are currently in the feasibility study stage. The system plan includes seven legs connecting Nashville to surrounding suburbs.

====Bridges====
Bridges within the city include:
===Utilities===
The city of Nashville owns the Nashville Electric Service (NES), Metro Water Services (MWS) and Nashville District Energy System (NDES). The Nashville Electric Service provides electricity to the entirety of Davidson County and small portions of the six adjacent counties, and purchases its power from the Tennessee Valley Authority. Metro Water Services provides water, wastewater, and stormwater to Nashville and the majority of Davidson County, as well as water services to small portions of Rutherford and Williamson counties, and wastewater services to small portions of all of the surrounding counties except for Cheatham County. MWS sources its water from the Cumberland River and operates two water treatment plants and three wastewater treatment plants. Ten additional utility companies provide water and sewer service to Nashville and Davidson County. The Nashville District Energy System provides heating and cooling services to certain buildings in downtown, including multiple government buildings. Natural gas is provided by Piedmont Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Duke Energy.

===Healthcare===

As a major center for the healthcare industry, Nashville is home to several hospitals and other primary care facilities. Most hospitals in Nashville are operated by Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the TriStar Division of Hospital Corporation of America, and Ascension Saint Thomas. The Metropolitan Nashville Hospital Authority operates Nashville General Hospital, which is affiliated with Meharry Medical College.

<doc id="22024" wikidata="Q36738" url="?curid=22024" title="Novial">
<text>Novial is an international auxiliary language (IAL) created by Danish linguist Otto Jespersen in 1928. It was designed to facilitate human communication between speakers of different native languages. The name of the language is a blend of the Novial word &quot;novi&quot; (meaning &#x27;new&quot;) and IAL.

Jespersen had been an early supporter of another international auxiliary language, Ido, a reformed version of Esperanto, before leaving to create his own language in 1928.

Novial&#x27;s vocabulary is borrowed largely from the Romance and Germanic languages, while its analytic grammar is influenced by English.

Novial was introduced in Jespersen&#x27;s book &quot;An International Language&quot; in 1928. It was updated in his dictionary &quot;Novial Lexike&quot; in 1930, and further modifications were proposed in the 1930s, but the language became dormant with Jespersen&#x27;s death in 1943. In the 1990s, with the revival of interest in constructed languages brought on by the Internet, some people rediscovered Novial.

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===
=== Vowels ===
===Stress===
The basic rule is: stress the vowel before the last consonant. However, consonantal flexional endings (ie. -d, -m, -n, -s) do not count for this (eg. but , not ; but , not ) so perhaps it is better to say that the vowel before the final consonant of the stem takes the stress.

==Orthography==
The digraphs &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;sh&quot; represent or , depending on the speaker. For example, would be pronounced either or .

==Grammar==
Like many constructed IALs, Novial has a simple and regular grammar. The main word order is SVO, which removes the need for marking the object of a sentence with accusative case (since the position normally tells what word is the object). There is however a way to mark accusative. There is no grammatical gender (but the sex or gender of referrents can be marked). Verbs are conjugated without agreement (according to person or number), and have a regular conjugation.

Nouns mainly end in &quot;e&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot; or &quot;um&quot; in the singular. There are definite forms of nouns marked with an article, and singular and plural forms, where the plural is marked with the suffix after vowels or after consonants. There is also a form for indefinite number (like in Mandarin Chinese and Japanese), expressed by removing the ending of the noun in the singular ( – lion, – &#x27;a/the lion is cruel&#x27;, or &#x27;lions are cruel&#x27;).

If a noun refers to a living being, then the form ending in is neutral in regards to sex, the one ending in female, and the one ending in male. If the noun is based on an adjective, nouns referring to living beings can be made with the previously mentioned rule, and furthermore nouns referring to concrete objects with , and abstractions with . The third person pronouns follows the same rule, together with the definite article.

In the case of a noun that refers to an instrument – a tool or a means – the word that ends in is the tool or the means itself, the verb describing usage of the tool and so on, and the noun describing the act of that using:

===Personal pronouns===

The standard word order in Novial is subject–verb–object, as in English. Therefore, the object need not be marked to distinguish it from the subject, and nominative (I, he, she and so on) and oblique (me, him, her) pronouns are identical:

The accusative (direct object) is therefore most often identical to the nominative (subject). However, in case of an ambiguity problem, an optional accusative ending, ( after a consonant), is available but is rarely used. The preposition is equivalent to this ending.

The personal possessive adjectives are formed from the pronouns by adding or after a consonant . This is in fact the genitive (possessive) of the pronoun so means both &#x27;my&#x27; and &#x27;mine&#x27; (&#x27;of me&#x27;):

The possessive pronouns are thus , , , etc., and , , etc. and . Possession may also be expressed with the preposition : , , and so on.

The reflexive pronoun is : – &#x27;he admires himself&#x27;. The impersonal pronoun one (&#x27;one/they/you&#x27;) is , with the possessive form .

===Verbs===
Verb forms never change with person or number. Most verb tenses, moods and voices are expressed with auxiliary verbs preceding the root form of the main verb. The auxiliaries follow the same word order as the English equivalent. The following phrases give examples of the verb forms:

* Present active participle: – &#x27;protecting&#x27;
* Past passive participle: – &#x27;protected&#x27;

Novial clearly distinguishes the passive of becoming and the passive of being. In English the forms are often the same, using the auxiliary verb &quot;to be&quot; followed by the past participle. However, the passive of becoming is also often expressed with the verb &quot;to get&quot; which is used in the examples below.

The passive voice of becoming is formed with the auxiliary followed by the root verb form. It can then be conjugated into the previously mentioned forms, for example:

The passive voice of being is formed with the auxiliary followed by the past passive participle (stem + &quot;-t&quot;). For example:

===Articles===
The definite article is which is invariant. It is used as in English.

There is no indefinite article, although (&#x27;one&#x27;) can be used.

===Nouns===
The plural noun is formed by adding to the singular ( after a consonant).

The accusative case is generally identical to the nominative but can optionally be marked with the ending ( after a consonant) with the plural being ( after a consonant) or with the preposition .

The genitive is formed with the ending ( after a consonant) with the plural being ( after a consonant) or with the preposition .

Other cases are formed with prepositions.

===Adjectives===
All adjectives end in , but this may be dropped if it is easy enough to pronounce and no confusion will be caused. Adjectives precede the noun qualified. Adjectives do not agree with the noun but may be given noun endings if there is no noun present to receive them.

Comparative adjectives are formed by placing various particles (, , and ) in front of the adjective receiving the comparison. Likewise, the superlative particles ( and ) precede the adjective. The adjective does not receive an inflection to its ending.

===Adverbs===
An adjective is converted to a corresponding adverb by adding after the ending of the adjective.

Comparative and superlative adverbs are formed in the same manner as comparative and superlative adjectives: by placing a specific particle before the adverb receiving the comparison.

==Novial compared to Esperanto and Ido==
Jespersen was a professional linguist, unlike Esperanto&#x27;s creator. He disliked the arbitrary and artificial character that he found in Esperanto and Ido. Additionally, he objected to those languages&#x27; inflectional systems, which he found needlessly complex. He sought to make Novial at once euphonious and regular while also preserving useful structures from natural languages.

In Novial:
* Syntax is largely a matter of word order, as in English and modern Scandinavian languages. There is no obligatory accusative marker as in Esperanto, but the accusative may optionally be marked with either an accusative ending or an accusative preposition.
* A genitive or possessive case is available as an alternative to the preposition . This is based on Jespersen&#x27;s observation that many modern languages have lost complex noun inflections, yet retain a possessive form.
* Auxiliary particles express most verb tenses. An inflectional ending is available as a shorthand for the simple past tense.

A major difference between Novial and Esperanto/Ido concerns noun endings. Jespersen rejected a single vowel to terminate all nouns (-o in Esperanto/Ido), finding it unnatural and potentially confusing. Instead, Novial nouns may end in , , , or or . These endings may be taken to indicate natural sex according to the custom in Romance languages, though there is no grammatical gender or requirement for adjectives to agree with nouns.

==Language sample for comparison==
Here is the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Novial and several related languages:
==Criticism==
As Jespersen relates in his autobiography, in 1934 he proposed an orthographic reform to Novial, which displeased a part of the users. Jespersen abandoned the essential principle of &quot;one sound, one letter&quot; :

Some of Jespersen&#x27;s colleagues among philologists jokingly referred to Novial as &quot;Jesperanto&quot;, combining his surname with Esperanto, the prototypical auxiliary language.

<text>In music, notes are distinct and isolatable sounds that act as the most basic building blocks for nearly all of music. This discretization facilitates performance, comprehension, and analysis. Notes may be visually communicated by writing them in musical notation.

Notes can distinguish the general pitch class or the specific pitch played by a pitched instrument. Although this article focuses on pitch, notes for unpitched percussion instruments distinguish between different percussion instruments (and/or different manners to sound them) instead of pitch. Note value expresses the relative duration of the note in time. Dynamics for a note indicate how loud to play them. Articulations may further indicate how performers should shape the attack and decay of the note and express fluctuations in a note&#x27;s timbre and pitch. Notes may even distinguish the use of different extended techniques by using special symbols.

The term &quot;note&quot; can refer to a specific musical event, for instance when saying the song &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;, begins with two notes of identical pitch. Or more generally, the term can refer to a class of identically sounding events, for instance when saying &quot;the song begins with the same note repeated twice&quot;.

== Distinguishing duration ==
A note can have a note value that indicates the note&#x27;s duration relative to the musical meter. In order of halving duration, these values are:

Longer note values (e.g. the longa) and shorter note values (e.g. the two hundred fifty-sixth note) do exist, but are very rare in modern times. These durations can further be subdivided using tuplets.

A rhythm is formed from a sequence in time of consecutive notes (without particular focus on pitch) and rests (the time between notes) of various durations.

== Distinguishing pitch ==

=== Distinguishing pitches of a scale ===
Music theory in most European countries and others use the solfège naming convention. Fixed do uses the syllables &quot;re–mi–fa–sol–la–ti&quot; specifically for the C major scale, while movable do labels notes of &quot;any&quot; major scale with that same order of syllables.

Alternatively, particularly in English- and some Dutch-speaking regions, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G), corresponding to the A minor scale. Several European countries, including Germany, use H instead of B (see for details). Byzantium used the names &quot;Pa–Vu–Ga–Di–Ke–Zo–Ni&quot; (Πα–Βου–Γα–Δι–Κε–Ζω–Νη).

In traditional Indian music, musical notes are called svaras and commonly represented using the seven notes, Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha and Ni.

=== Writing notes on a staff ===
In a score, each note is assigned a specific vertical position on a staff position (a line or space) on the staff, as determined by the clef. Each line or space is assigned a note name. These names are memorized by musicians and allow them to know at a glance the proper pitch to play on their instruments.
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; {
c1 d1 e1 f1 g1 a1 b1 c1 b1 a1 g1 f1 e1 d1 c1
\layout {
 \context {
 \Staff
 \remove Time_signature_engraver
 \remove Bar_engraver
 } 
\midi {
 \tempo 1 = 120
&lt;/score&gt;
The staff above shows the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C and then in reverse order, with no key signature or accidentals.

=== Accidentals ===
Notes that belong to the diatonic scale relevant in a tonal context are called &quot;diatonic notes&quot;. Notes that do not meet that criterion are called &quot;chromatic notes&quot; or &quot;accidentals&quot;. Accidental symbols visually communicate a modification of a note&#x27;s pitch from its tonal context. Most commonly, the sharp symbol () raises a note by a half step, while the flat symbol () lowers a note by a half step. This half step interval is also known as a semitone (which has an equal temperament frequency ratio of  ≅ 1.0595). The natural symbol () indicates that any previously applied accidentals should be cancelled. Advanced musicians use the double-sharp symbol () to raise the pitch by two semitones, the double-flat symbol () to lower it by two semitones, and even more advanced accidental symbols (e.g. for quarter tones). Accidental symbols are placed to &quot;the right&quot; of a note&#x27;s letter when written in text (e.g. F is F-sharp, B is B-flat, and C is C natural), but are placed to &quot;the left&quot; of a note&#x27;s head when drawn on a staff.

Systematic alterations to any of the 7 lettered pitch classes are communicated using a key signature. When drawn on a staff, accidental symbols are positioned in a key signature to indicate that those alterations apply to all occurrences of the lettered pitch class corresponding to each symbol&#x27;s position. Additional explicitly-noted accidentals can be drawn next to noteheads to override the key signature for all subsequent notes with the same lettered pitch class in that bar. However, this effect does not accumulate for subsequent accidental symbols for the same pitch class.

=== 12-tone chromatic scale ===
Assuming enharmonicity, accidentals can create pitch equivalences between different notes (e.g. the note B represents the same pitch as the note C). Thus, a 12-note chromatic scale adds 5 pitch classes in addition to the 7 lettered pitch classes.

The following chart lists names used in different countries for the 12 pitch classes of a chromatic scale built on C. Their corresponding symbols are in parentheses. Differences between German and English notation are highlighted in bold typeface. Although the English and Dutch names are different, the corresponding symbols are identical.

=== Distinguishing pitches of different octaves ===
Two pitches that are any number of octaves apart (i.e. their fundamental frequencies are in a ratio equal to a power of two) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same pitch class and are often given the same name.

The top note of a musical scale is the bottom note&#x27;s second harmonic and has double the bottom note&#x27;s frequency. Because both notes belong to the same pitch class, they are often called by the same name. That top note may also be referred to as the &quot;octave&quot; of the bottom note, since an octave is the interval between a note and another with double frequency.

==== Scientific versus Helmholtz pitch notation ====
Two nomenclature systems for differentiating pitches that have the same pitch class but which fall into different octaves are:

# Helmholtz pitch notation, which distinguishes octaves using prime symbols and letter case of the pitch class letter.
#* The octave below tenor C is called the &quot;great&quot; octave. Notes in it and are written as upper case letters.
#** The next lower octave is named &quot;contra&quot;. Notes in it include a prime symbol below the note&#x27;s letter.
#** Names of subsequent lower octaves are preceded with &quot;sub&quot;. Notes in each include an additional prime symbol below the note&#x27;s letter.
#* The octave starting at tenor C is called the &quot;small&quot; octave. Notes in it are written as lower case letters, so tenor C itself is written c in Helmholtz notation.
#** The next higher octave is called &quot;one-lined&quot;. Notes in it include a prime symbol above the note&#x27;s letter, so middle C is written c′.
#** Names of subsequently higher octaves use higher numbers before the &quot;lined&quot;. Notes in each include an addition prime symbol above the note&#x27;s letter.
# Scientific pitch notation, where a pitch class letter (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) is followed by a subscript Arabic numeral designating a specific octave.
#* Middle C is named C4 and is the start of the 4th octave.
#** Higher octaves use successively higher number and lower octaves use successively lower numbers.
#** The lowest note on most pianos is A0, the highest is C8.

For instance, the standard 440 Hz tuning pitch is named A4 in scientific notation and instead named a′ in Helmholtz notation.

Meanwhile, the electronic musical instrument standard called MIDI doesn&#x27;t specifically designate pitch classes, but instead names pitches by counting from its lowest note: number 0 ; up chromatically to its highest: number 127 (Although the MIDI &quot;standard&quot; is clear, the octaves actually played by any one MIDI device don&#x27;t necessarily match the octaves shown below, especially in older instruments.)

=== Pitch frequency in hertz ===
Pitch is associated with the frequency of physical oscillations measured in hertz (Hz) representing the number of these oscillations per second. While notes can have any arbitrary frequency, notes in more consonant music tends to have pitches with simpler mathematical ratios to each other.

Western music defines pitches around a central reference &quot;concert pitch&quot; of A4, currently standardized as 440 Hz. Notes played &quot;in tune&quot; with the 12 equal temperament system will be an integer number formula_1 of half-steps above (positive formula_1) or below (negative formula_1) that reference note, and thus have a frequency of:
:formula_4

Octaves automatically yield powers of two times the original frequency, since formula_1 can be expressed as formula_6 when formula_1 is a multiple of 12 (with formula_8 being the number of octaves up or down). Thus the above formula reduces to yield a power of 2 multiplied by 440 Hz:

:formula_9

==== Logarithmic scale ====
The base-2 logarithm of the above frequency–pitch relation conveniently results in a linear relationship with formula_1 or formula_8:
:formula_12

When dealing specifically with intervals (rather than absolute frequency), the constant formula_13 can be conveniently ignored, because the &quot;difference&quot; between any two frequencies formula_14 and formula_15 in this logarithmic scale simplifies to:
:formula_16

Cents are a convenient unit for humans to express finer divisions of this logarithmic scale that are of an equally-tempered semitone. Since one semitone equals 100 cents, one octave equals 12 ⋅ 100 cents = 1200 cents. Cents correspond to a &quot;difference&quot; in this logarithmic scale, however in the regular linear scale of frequency, adding 1 cent corresponds to &quot;multiplying&quot; a frequency by  (≅ ).

==== MIDI ====
For use with the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) standard, a frequency mapping is defined by:

:formula_17

where formula_18 is the MIDI note number. 69 is the number of semitones between C−1 (MIDI note 0) and A4.

Conversely, the formula to determine frequency from a MIDI note formula_18 is:

:formula_20

=== Pitch names and their history ===

Music notation systems have used letters of the alphabet for centuries. The 6th century philosopher Boethius is known to have used the first fourteen letters of the classical Latin alphabet (the letter J did not exist until the 16th century),
:A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   K   L   M   N   O
to signify the notes of the two-octave range that was in use at the time and in modern scientific pitch notation are represented as
:A   B   C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D   E   F   G

Though it is not known whether this was his devising or common usage at the time, this is nonetheless called &quot;Boethian notation&quot;. Although Boethius is the first author known to use this nomenclature in the literature, Ptolemy wrote of the two-octave range five centuries before, calling it the &quot;perfect system&quot; or &quot;complete system&quot; – as opposed to other, smaller-range note systems that did not contain all possible species of octave (i.e., the seven octaves starting from A, B, C, D, E, F, and G). A modified form of Boethius&#x27; notation later appeared in the &quot;Dialogus de musica&quot; (ca. 1000) by Pseudo-Odo, in a discussion of the division of the monochord.

Following this, the range (or compass) of used notes was extended to three octaves, and the system of repeating letters A–G in each octave was introduced, these being written as lower-case for the second octave (a–g) and double lower-case letters for the third (aa–gg). When the range was extended down by one note, to a G, that note was denoted using the Greek letter gamma (), the lowest note in Medieval music notation. (It is from this gamma that the French word for scale, derives, and the English word &quot;gamut&quot;, from &quot;gamma-ut&quot;.)

The remaining five notes of the chromatic scale (the black keys on a piano keyboard) were added gradually; the first being B, since B was flattened in certain modes to avoid the dissonant tritone interval. This change was not always shown in notation, but when written, B (B flat) was written as a Latin, cursive &quot;&quot;, and B (B natural) a Gothic script (known as Blackletter) or &quot;hard-edged&quot; . These evolved into the modern flat () and natural () symbols respectively. The sharp symbol arose from a (barred b), called the &quot;cancelled b&quot;.

==== B♭, B and H ====
In parts of Europe, including Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Norway, Denmark, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Finland, and Iceland (and Sweden before the 1990s), the Gothic  transformed into the letter h (possibly for &quot;&quot;, German for &quot;harsh&quot;, as opposed to &quot;&quot;, German for &quot;planar&quot;, or just because the Gothic  and resemble each other). Therefore, in current German music notation, H is used instead of B (B natural), and B instead of B (B flat). Occasionally, music written in German for international use will use H for B natural and B for B flat (with a modern-script lower-case b, instead of a flat sign, ). Since a or B in Northern Europe (notated B in modern convention) is both rare and unorthodox (more likely to be expressed as Heses), it is generally clear what this notation means.

==== System &quot;do–re–mi–fa–sol–la–si&quot; ====

In Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Romanian, Greek, Albanian, Russian, Mongolian, Flemish, Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Turkish and Vietnamese the note names are &quot;do–re–mi–fa–sol–la–si&quot; rather than C–D–E–F–G–A–B. These names follow the original names reputedly given by Guido d&#x27;Arezzo, who had taken them from the first syllables of the first six musical phrases of a Gregorian chant melody &quot;Ut queant laxis&quot;, whose successive lines began on the appropriate scale degrees. These became the basis of the solfège system. For ease of singing, the name &quot;ut&quot; was largely replaced by &quot;do&quot; (most likely from the beginning of &quot;Dominus&quot;, &quot;Lord&quot;), though &quot;ut&quot; is still used in some places. It was the Italian musicologist and humanist Giovanni Battista Doni (1595–1647) who successfully promoted renaming the name of the note from &quot;ut&quot; to &quot;do&quot;. For the seventh degree, the name &quot;si&quot; (from &quot;Sancte Iohannes&quot;, St. John, to whom the hymn is dedicated), though in some regions the seventh is named &quot;ti&quot; (again, easier to pronounce while singing).

<text>Nephrology is a specialty for both adult internal medicine and pediatric medicine that concerns the study of the kidneys, specifically normal kidney function (renal physiology) and kidney disease (renal pathophysiology), the preservation of kidney health, and the treatment of kidney disease, from diet and medication to renal replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation). The word &quot;renal&quot; is an adjective meaning &quot;relating to the kidneys&quot;, and its roots are French or late Latin. Whereas according to some opinions, &quot;renal&quot; and &quot;nephro-&quot; should be replaced with &quot;kidney&quot; in scientific writings such as &quot;kidney medicine&quot; (instead of &quot;nephrology&quot;) or &quot;kidney replacement therapy&quot;, other experts have advocated preserving the use of renal and nephro- as appropriate including in &quot;nephrology&quot; and &quot;renal replacement therapy&quot;, respectively.

Nephrology also studies systemic conditions that affect the kidneys, such as diabetes and autoimmune disease; and systemic diseases that occur as a result of kidney disease, such as renal osteodystrophy and hypertension. A physician who has undertaken additional training and become certified in nephrology is called a &quot;nephrologist&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;nephrology&quot; was first used in about 1960, according to the French &quot;néphrologie&quot; proposed by Jean Hamburger in 1953, from the Greek , &quot;nephrós&quot; (kidney). Before then, the specialty was usually referred to as &quot;kidney medicine&quot;.

==Scope==

Nephrology concerns the diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases, including electrolyte disturbances and hypertension, and the care of those requiring renal replacement therapy, including dialysis and renal transplant patients.

The word &quot;dialysis&quot; is from the mid-19th century: via Latin from the Greek word &quot;dialusis&quot;; from &quot;dialuein&quot; (split, separate), from &quot;dia&quot; (apart) and &quot;luein&quot; (set free). In other words, dialysis replaces the primary (excretory) function of the kidney, which separates (and removes) excess toxins and water from the blood, placing them in the urine.

Many diseases affecting the kidney are systemic disorders not limited to the organ itself, and may require special treatment. Examples include acquired conditions such as systemic vasculitides (e.g. ANCA vasculitis) and autoimmune diseases (e.g. lupus), as well as congenital or genetic conditions such as polycystic kidney disease.

Patients are referred to nephrology specialists after a urinalysis, for various reasons, such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, hematuria, proteinuria, kidney stones, hypertension, and disorders of acid/base or electrolytes.

==Nephrologist==
A nephrologist is a physician who specializes in the care and treatment of kidney disease. Nephrology requires additional training to become an expert with advanced skills. Nephrologists may provide care to people without kidney problems and may work in general/internal medicine, transplant medicine, immunosuppression management, intensive care medicine, clinical pharmacology, perioperative medicine, or pediatric nephrology.

Nephrologists may further sub-specialise in dialysis, kidney transplantation, home therapies (home dialysis), cancer-related kidney diseases (onco-nephrology), structural kidney diseases (uro-nephrology), procedural nephrology or other non-nephrology areas as described above.

Procedures a nephrologist may perform include native kidney and transplant kidney biopsy, dialysis access insertion (temporary vascular access lines, tunnelled vascular access lines, peritoneal dialysis access lines), fistula management (angiographic or surgical fistulogram and plasty), and bone biopsy . Bone biopsies are now unusual.

===Training ===

India

To become a nephrologist in India, one has to complete an MBBS (5 and 1/2 years) degree, followed by an MD/DNB (3 years) either in medicine or paediatrics, followed by a DM/DNB (3 years) course in either nephrology or paediatric nephrology.

====Australia and New Zealand====
Nephrology training in Australia and New Zealand typically includes completion of a medical degree (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery: 4–6 years), internship (1 year), Basic Physician Training (3 years minimum), successful completion of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians written and clinical examinations, and Advanced Physician Training in Nephrology (3 years). The training pathway is overseen and accredited by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, though the application process varies across states. Completion of a post-graduate degree (usually a PhD) in a nephrology research interest (3–4 years) is optional but increasingly common. Finally, many Australian and New Zealand nephrologists participate in career-long professional and personal development through bodies such as the Australian and New Zealand Society of Nephrology and the Transplant Society of Australia and New Zealand.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, nephrology (often called renal medicine) is a subspecialty of general medicine. A nephrologist has completed medical school, foundation year posts (FY1 and FY2) and core medical training (CMT), specialist training (ST) and passed the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) exam before competing for a National Training Number (NTN) in renal medicine. The typical Specialty Training (when they are called a registrar, or an ST) is five years and leads to a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) in both renal medicine and general (internal) medicine. In those five years, they usually rotate yearly between hospitals in a region (known as a deanery). They are then accepted on to the Specialist Register of the General Medical Council (GMC). Specialty trainees often interrupt their clinical training to obtain research degrees (MD/PhD). After achieving CCT, the registrar (ST) may apply for a permanent post as Consultant in Renal Medicine. Subsequently, some Consultants practice nephrology alone. Others work in this area, and in Intensive Care (ICU), or General (Internal) or Acute Medicine.

====United States====
Nephrology training can be accomplished through one of two routes. The first path way is through an internal medicine pathway leading to an Internal Medicine/Nephrology specialty, and sometimes known as &quot;adult nephrology&quot;. The second pathway is through Pediatrics leading to a speciality in Pediatric Nephrology. In the United States, after medical school adult nephrologists complete a three-year residency in internal medicine followed by a two-year (or longer) fellowship in nephrology. Complementary to an adult nephrologist, a pediatric nephrologist will complete a three-year pediatric residency after medical school or a four-year Combined Internal Medicine and Pediatrics residency. This is followed by a three-year fellowship in Pediatric Nephrology. Once training is satisfactorily completed, the physician is eligible to take the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) or American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine (AOBIM) nephrology examination. Nephrologists must be approved by one of these boards. To be approved, the physician must fulfill the requirements for education and training in nephrology in order to qualify to take the board&#x27;s examination. If a physician passes the examination, then he or she can become a nephrology specialist. Typically, nephrologists also need two to three years of training in an ACGME or AOA accredited fellowship in nephrology. Nearly all programs train nephrologists in continuous renal replacement therapy; fewer than half in the United States train in the provision of plasmapheresis. Only pediatric trained physicians are able to train in pediatric nephrology, and internal medicine (adult) trained physicians may enter general (adult) nephrology fellowships.

==Diagnosis==
History and physical examination are central to the diagnostic workup in nephrology. The history typically includes the present illness, family history, general medical history, diet, medication use, drug use and occupation. The physical examination typically includes an assessment of volume state, blood pressure, heart, lungs, peripheral arteries, joints, abdomen and flank. A rash may be relevant too, especially as an indicator of autoimmune disease.

Examination of the urine (urinalysis) allows a direct assessment for possible kidney problems, which may be suggested by appearance of blood in the urine (hematuria), protein in the urine (proteinuria), pus cells in the urine (pyuria) or cancer cells in the urine. A 24-hour urine collection used to be used to quantify daily protein loss (see proteinuria), urine output, creatinine clearance or electrolyte handling by the renal tubules. It is now more common to measure protein loss from a small random sample of urine.

Basic blood tests can be used to check the concentration of hemoglobin, white count, platelets, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea, creatinine, albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood. All of these may be affected by kidney problems. The serum creatinine concentration is the most important blood test as it is used to estimate the function of the kidney, called the creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

It is a good idea for patients with longterm kidney disease to know an up-to-date list of medications, and their latest blood tests, especially the blood creatinine level. In the United Kingdom, blood tests can monitored online by the patient, through a website called RenalPatientView.

More specialized tests can be ordered to discover or link certain systemic diseases to kidney failure such as infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C), autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus, ANCA vasculitis), paraproteinemias (amyloidosis, multiple myeloma) and metabolic diseases (diabetes, cystinosis).

Structural abnormalities of the kidneys are identified with imaging tests. These may include Medical ultrasonography/ultrasound, computed axial tomography (CT), scintigraphy (nuclear medicine), angiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

In certain circumstances, less invasive testing may not provide a certain diagnosis. Where definitive diagnosis is required, a biopsy of the kidney (renal biopsy) may be performed. This typically involves the insertion, under local anaesthetic and ultrasound or CT guidance, of a core biopsy needle into the kidney to obtain a small sample of kidney tissue. The kidney tissue is then examined under a microscope, allowing direct visualization of the changes occurring within the kidney. Additionally, the pathology may also stage a problem affecting the kidney, allowing some degree of prognostication. In some circumstances, kidney biopsy will also be used to monitor response to treatment and identify early relapse. A transplant kidney biopsy may also be performed to look for rejection of the kidney.

==Treatment==
Treatments in nephrology can include medications, blood products, surgical interventions (urology, vascular or surgical procedures), renal replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation) and plasma exchange. Kidney problems can have significant impact on quality and length of life, and so psychological support, health education and advanced care planning play key roles in nephrology.

Chronic kidney disease is typically managed with treatment of causative conditions (such as diabetes), avoidance of substances toxic to the kidneys (nephrotoxins like radiologic contrast and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), antihypertensives, diet and weight modification and planning for end-stage kidney failure. Impaired kidney function has systemic effects on the body. An erythropoetin stimulating agent (ESA) may be required to ensure adequate production of red blood cells, activated vitamin D supplements and phosphate binders may be required to counteract the effects of kidney failure on bone metabolism, and blood volume and electrolyte disturbance may need correction. Diuretics (such as furosemide) may be used to correct fluid overload, and alkalis (such as sodium bicarbonate) can be used to treat metabolic acidosis.

Auto-immune and inflammatory kidney disease, such as vasculitis or transplant rejection, may be treated with immunosuppression. Commonly used agents are prednisone, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, everolimus, thymoglobulin and sirolimus. Newer, so-called &quot;biologic drugs&quot; or monoclonal antibodies, are also used in these conditions and include rituximab, basiliximab and eculizumab. Blood products including intravenous immunoglobulin and a process known as plasma exchange can also be employed.

When the kidneys are no longer able to sustain the demands of the body, end-stage kidney failure is said to have occurred. Without renal replacement therapy, death from kidney failure will eventually result. Dialysis is an artificial method of replacing some kidney function to prolong life. Renal transplantation replaces kidney function by inserting into the body a healthier kidney from an organ donor and inducing immunologic tolerance of that organ with immunosuppression. At present, renal transplantation is the most effective treatment for end-stage kidney failure although its worldwide availability is limited by lack of availability of donor organs. Generally speaking, kidneys from living donors are &#x27;better&#x27; than those from deceased donors, as they last longer.

Most kidney conditions are chronic conditions and so long term followup with a nephrologist is usually necessary. In the United Kingdom, care may be shared with the patient&#x27;s primary care physician, called a General Practitioner (GP).

==Organizations==
The world&#x27;s first society of nephrology was the French &#x27;Societe de Pathologie Renale&#x27;. Its first president was Jean Hamburger, and its first meeting was in Paris in February 1949. In 1959, Hamburger also founded the &#x27;Société de Néphrologie&#x27;, as a continuation of the older society. It is now called Francophone Society of Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation (SFNDT). The second society of nephrologists, the UK Kidney Association (UKKA) was founded in 1950, originally named the Renal Association. Its first president was Arthur Osman and met for the first time, in London, on 30 March 1950. The Società di Nefrologia Italiana was founded in 1957 and was the first national society to incorporate the phrase nephrologia (or nephrology) into its name.

The word &#x27;nephrology&#x27; appeared for the first time in a conference, on 1–4 September 1960 at the &quot;Premier Congrès International de Néphrologie&quot; in Evian and Geneva, the first meeting of the International Society of Nephrology (ISN, International Society of Nephrology). The first day (1.9.60) was in Geneva and the next three (2–4.9.60) were in Evian, France. The early history of the ISN is described by Robinson and Richet in 2005 and the later history by Barsoum in 2011. The ISN is the largest global society representing medical professionals engaged in advancing kidney care worldwide. It has an international office in Brussels, Belgium.

In the US, founded in 1964, the National Kidney Foundation is a national organization representing patients and professionals who treat kidney diseases. Founded in 1966, the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) is the world&#x27;s largest professional society devoted to the study of kidney disease. The American Nephrology Nurses&#x27; Association (ANNA), founded in 1969, promotes excellence in and appreciation of nephrology nursing to make a positive difference for patients with kidney disease. The American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP) is a non-profit, patient-centric group focused on improving the health and well-being of CKD and dialysis patients. The National Renal Administrators Association (NRAA), founded in 1977, is a national organization that represents and supports the independent and community-based dialysis providers. The American Kidney Fund directly provides financial support to patients in need, as well as participating in health education and prevention efforts. ASDIN (American Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology) is the main organization of interventional nephrologists. Other organizations include CIDA, VASA etc. which deal with dialysis vascular access. The Renal Support Network (RSN) is a nonprofit, patient-focused, patient-run organization that provides non-medical services to those affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD).

In the United Kingdom, UK National Kidney Federation and Kidney Care UK (previously known as British Kidney Patient Association, BKPA) represent patients, and the UK Kidney Association used to represent renal physicians and worked closely with a previous NHS policy directive called a National Service Framework for kidney disease.

<text>Native Esperanto speakers (Esperanto: &quot;denaskuloj&quot; or &quot;denaskaj esperantistoj&quot;) are people who have acquired Esperanto as one of their native languages. As of 1996, there were 350 or so attested cases of families with native Esperanto speakers. Estimates from associations indicate that there were around 1,000 Esperanto-speaking families, involving perhaps 2,000 children in 2004. In the majority of such families, the parents had the same native language, though in many the parents had different native languages, and only Esperanto in common.
==History==
Raising children in Esperanto occurred early in the history of the language, notably with the five children of Montagu Butler (1884–1970). Owing to this, some families have passed Esperanto on to their children over several generations. Also notable are young Holocaust victim Petr Ginz, whose drawing of the planet Earth as viewed from the Moon was carried aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, and Daniel Bovet, the recipient of the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

In at least one instance, Esperanto was used as a bridge language for a family started by a couple who did not have a native language in common.

Esperanto is not the primary language of any geographic region, though it is spoken at events such as conventions like the World Congress of Esperanto and isolated offices, such as the World Esperanto Association&#x27;s central office in Rotterdam. Consequently, native speakers have limited opportunity to meet one another except where meetings are specially arranged. For that reason, many parents consider it important to bring their children regularly to Esperanto conventions such as the annual &quot;Renkontiĝo de Esperanto-familioj&quot; (or &quot;Esperantistaj familioj&quot;; REF, since 1979). Similarly, the annual happens alongside the largest Esperanto convention, the World Congress of Esperanto (&quot;Universala Kongreso&quot;).

==List of noted native speakers==
Below is a list of noted native Esperanto speakers. The billionaire George Soros has often appeared on such lists, but Humphrey Tonkin, the translator of Soros&#x27;s father&#x27;s memoir &quot;Maskerado ĉirkaŭ la morto&quot; into English (under the title &quot;Masquerade: The Incredible True Story of How George Soros’ Father Outsmarted the Gestapo&quot;), has disputed this. He has made no statements either way concerning Soros&#x27;s brother. 

*Daniel Bovet, Swiss-born Italian pharmacologist
*Petr Ginz, Czech author, artist, and Holocaust victim
*Kim J. Henriksen, Danish singer-musician
*Ino Kolbe, German author
*Carlo Minnaja, Italian writer

==Grammatical characteristics==

The Esperanto of native-speaking children differs from the standard Esperanto spoken by their parents. In some cases this is due to interference from their other native language (the adstrate), but in others it appears to be an effect of acquisition.

Bergen (2001) found the following patterns in a study of eight native-speaking children, aged 6 to 14, who were bilingual in Hebrew (two siblings), Slovak (two siblings), French, Swiss German, Russian, and Croatian.

*Phonological reduction (usually to schwa) of vowels in common grammatical suffixes and one-syllable grammatical words. This occurred about 5% of the time. The reduced grammatical suffixes were mostly the &quot;-o&quot; of nouns and &quot;-as&quot; of present-tense verbs, but occasionally also the &quot;-a&quot; of adjectives. Reduced grammatical words included personal pronouns (which all end in &quot;i&quot;), the article &quot;la&quot; &#x27;the&#x27;, and prepositions such as &quot;al&quot; &#x27;to&#x27; and &quot;je&quot; (a generic preposition). The article &quot;la&quot; was sometimes omitted with the Slavic speakers, as might be expected as a contact effect. 
*Proper nouns were generally unassimilated, either to Esperanto grammatical suffixes or to stress patterns. Proper nouns are common exceptions to grammatical rules in many languages, and this pattern is common among L2-speakers of Esperanto as well. However, stress was also observed to vary in native words, for example &quot;nómiĝas&quot; &#x27;is/am called&#x27; and &quot;ámikoj&quot; &#x27;friends&#x27; (stress expected on the &quot;i&quot; in both cases).
*Children were not observed to use compound tenses (&quot;esti&quot; + a participle) or aspectual affixes (&quot;ek-, -iĝi, -adi, re-, el-&quot;) on verbal roots. Except for simple passives, the parents were not observed to use compound tenses either. However, they did use aspectual affixes (at least in the formal context of Bergen&#x27;s interviews), but nonetheless the children did not use such affixes even when their other language was Slavic, where aspectual affixes are important. The closest thing to such forms that the children were observed to use were &quot;fini&quot; + verb &#x27;stop doing something&#x27;, &quot;komenci&quot; + verb &#x27;start doing something&#x27;, &quot;ankoraŭ&quot; &#x27;still&#x27;, and &quot;kaj poste&quot; &#x27;and then&#x27;; but even then, usage was not as common as equivalents in the adstrate language. &quot;-Iĝi&quot; was, however, used on adjectival roots:
::&quot;Malheliĝas kaj ili ankoraŭ estas ĉe la plaĝo.&quot; – It&#x27;s becoming dark and they are still on the beach.
*The word order was mostly SVO. OSV order was also attested, but half of all instances were with the child who spoke Swiss German, which allows preposing the object.
*Related to the fixed word order, there is evidence that the accusative case has become redundant. Usage closely reflects the role of case in the adstrate language, being used only where consistent with the other language, but not always even there. Usage ranged from ≈100% with the Slovak-speaking children, to 0% with the French-speaking child, despite the fact that the French mother consistently used the accusative case in her own speech. Slovak has an accusative case on nouns, French does not. Other children used the accusative in only some of the contexts required by standard Esperanto, largely reflecting usage in their other language. There were other patterns to emerge as well. The Croatian child, for example, used the accusative only on personal pronouns immediately following a verb, a feature of reduction to clitic form common in Croatian (underlined):
::&quot;En la sepa, unu infano prenis lian ŝtrumpo.&quot; (Standard: &quot;lian ŝtrumpon&quot;) – At seven o&#x27;clock, a child took his sock.
:but
::&quot;Poste li iris kaj poste li prenis en unu mano lia simio.&quot; (Standard: &quot;lian simion&quot;) – Then he went and then he took in one hand his monkey.

Among children that do use the accusative, its usage may be regularized from adult usage, at least at young ages. For example, when a screw dropped out of a lock, a young (≤ 5-year-old) child said it &quot;malvenis la pordon.&quot; Besides the novel use of &quot;mal-&quot; with &quot;veni&quot; &#x27;to come&#x27; to mean &#x27;come away from&#x27;, the accusative is not used in adult speech for motion away, but only motion towards. However, in this case the child generalized the usage of the accusative for direct objects.

Lindstedt, on the other hand, referencing Bergen&#x27;s study, contends that &quot;it is difficult to find convincing examples of changes introduced by the process of nativisation. All examples proposed seem rather to be due to (1) transfers from the children’s other native languages, (2) differences between the spoken and written register of Esperanto and, in some cases, (3) incomplete acquisition.&quot; Some of the features, such as phonological reduction, can be found in the speech of some fluent non-native speakers, while some other, such as the attrition of the accusative, are completely absent from the speech of some native-speaking children.

==Word derivation==

Native-speaking children, especially at a young age, may coin words that do not exist in the speech of their parents, often for concepts for which Esperanto has a word they do not yet know, by exploiting the morphology of the language. This is analogous to what adult speakers do for concepts where Esperanto lacks a word, and indicates that some of the grammatical alterations that adult learners may find difficult come easily to native-speaking children. For example,

*Antonyms in &quot;mal-&quot;

::&quot;mi superruliĝos vin&quot; &#x27;I will roll over you&#x27; (an intransitive verb ending in &quot;-iĝos&quot; won&#x27;t normally take an object in the accusative case, but here it is necessary because the preposition &quot;super&quot; &#x27;over&#x27; has been moved to the verb &quot;rul&quot; &#x27;roll&#x27;. Without the suffix &quot;-iĝos&quot;, however, the meaning would be a transitive &#x27;I will roll you over&#x27;.)

<text>The Republic of Nicaragua v. The United States of America (1986) was a case where the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the U.S. had violated international law by supporting the Contras in their rebellion against the Sandinistas and by mining Nicaragua&#x27;s harbors. The case was decided in favor of Nicaragua and against the United States with the awarding of reparations to Nicaragua.

The Court had 15 final decisions upon which it voted. The Court found in its verdict that the United States was &quot;in breach of its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another State&quot;, &quot;not to intervene in its affairs&quot;, &quot;not to violate its sovereignty&quot;, &quot;not to interrupt peaceful maritime commerce&quot;, and &quot;in breach of its obligations under Article XIX of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the Parties signed at Managua on 21 January 1956.&quot; In Statement 9, the Court stated that while the U.S. encouraged human rights violations by the Contras by the manual entitled &quot;Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare&quot;, this did not make such acts attributable to the U.S.

The United States refused to participate in the proceedings, arguing that the ICJ lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The U.S. also blocked enforcement of the judgment by the United Nations Security Council and thereby prevented Nicaragua from obtaining any compensation. Nicaragua, under the later, post-FSLN government of Violeta Chamorro, withdrew the complaint from the court in September 1992 following a repeal of the law which had required the country to seek compensation.

==Background and history of US intervention in Nicaragua==
The first armed intervention by the United States in Nicaragua occurred under President Taft. In 1909, he ordered the overthrow of Nicaraguan President José Santos Zelaya. During August and September 1912, a contingent of 2,300 U.S. Marines landed at the port of Corinto and occupied León and the railway line to Granada. A pro-U.S. government was formed under the occupation. The 1914 Bryan–Chamorro Treaty granted perpetual canal rights to the U.S. in Nicaragua and was signed ten days before the U.S.-operated Panama Canal opened for use, thus preventing anyone from building a competing canal in Nicaragua without U.S. permission.

In 1927, under Augusto César Sandino, a major peasant uprising was launched against both the U.S. occupation and the Nicaraguan establishment. In 1933, the Marines withdrew and left the Nicaraguan National Guard in charge of internal security and elections. In 1934, Anastasio Somoza García, the head of the National Guard, ordered his forces to capture and murder Sandino. In 1937, Somoza assumed the presidency, while still in control of the National Guard, and established a dictatorship that his family controlled until 1979.

The downfall of the regime is attributed to its embezzlement of millions of dollars in foreign aid that was given to the country in response to the devastating 1972 earthquake. Many moderate supporters of the dictatorship began abandoning it in the face of growing revolutionary sentiment. The Sandinista (FSLN) movement organized relief, began to expand its influence and assumed the leadership of the revolution. A popular uprising brought the FSLN to power in 1979. The United States had long been opposed to the socialist FSLN, and after the revolution the Carter administration moved quickly to support the Somocistas with financial and material aid. When Ronald Reagan took office, he augmented the direct support to an anti-Sandinista group, called the Contras, which included factions loyal to the former dictatorship. When Congress prohibited further funding to the Contras, Oliver North continued the funding through arms sales that were also prohibited by Congress.

==Nicaragua&#x27;s submissions==
Nicaragua charged:

:(a) That the United States, in recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding, and directing military and paramilitary actions in and against Nicaragua, had violated its treaty obligations to Nicaragua under:
:: Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter;
:: Articles 18 and 20 of the Charter of the Organization of American States;
:: Article 8 of the Convention on the Rights and Duties of States;
:: Article I, Third, of the Convention concerning the Duties and Rights of States in the Event of Civil Strife.

:(b) That the United States had breached customary international law by

::1. violating the sovereignty of Nicaragua by:
::: armed attacks against Nicaragua by air, land and sea;
::: incursions into Nicaraguan territorial waters;
::: aerial trespass into Nicaraguan airspace;
::: efforts by direct and indirect means to coerce and intimidate the Government of Nicaragua.
::2. using force and the threat of force against Nicaragua.
::3. intervening in the internal affairs of Nicaragua.
::4. infringing upon the freedom of the high seas and interrupting peaceful maritime commerce.
::5. killing, wounding and kidnapping citizens of Nicaragua.

Nicaragua demanded that all such actions cease and that the United States had an obligation to pay reparations to the government for damage to their people, property, and economy.

It is noteworthy that the United States, the respondent party, was the only member that put forward arguments against the validity of the judgment of the court, arguing that it passed a decision that it &quot;had neither the jurisdiction nor the competence to render.&quot; Members that sided with the United States in opposing Nicaragua&#x27;s claims did not challenge the court&#x27;s jurisdiction, its findings, nor the substantive merits of the case.

==Judgment==
The lengthy judgment first listed 291 points, among them that the United States had been involved in the &quot;unlawful use of force&quot;. The violations included attacks on Nicaraguan facilities and naval vessels, the mining of Nicaraguan ports, the invasion of Nicaraguan air space, and the training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying of forces (the &quot;Contras&quot;) and seeking to overthrow Nicaragua&#x27;s Sandinista government. This was followed by the statements that the judges voted on.

===Findings===
The court found evidence of an arms flow between Nicaragua and insurgents in El Salvador between 1979 and 1981. However, there was not enough evidence to show that the Nicaraguan government was imputable for this or that the US response was proportional. The court also found that certain transborder incursions into the territory of Guatemala and Costa Rica, in 1982, 1983 and 1984, were imputable to the Government of Nicaragua. However, neither Guatemala nor Costa Rica had made any request for US intervention; El Salvador did in 1984, well after the US had intervened unilaterally. 

&quot;As regards El Salvador, the Court considers that in customary international law the provision of arms to the opposition in another State does not constitute an armed attack on that State. As regards Honduras and Costa Rica, the Court states that, in the absence of sufficient information as to the transborder incursions into the territory of those two States from Nicaragua, it is difficult to decide whether they amount, singly or collectively, to an armed attack by Nicaragua. The Court finds that neither these incursions nor the alleged supply of arms may be relied on as justifying the exercise of the right of collective self-defence.&quot;

Regarding human rights violations by the Contras, &quot;The Court has to determine whether the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was such that it would be right to equate the Contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government. The Court considers that the evidence available to it is insufficient to demonstrate the total dependence of the Contras on United States aid. A partial dependency, the exact extent of which the Court cannot establish, may be inferred from the fact that the leaders were selected by the United States, and from other factors such as the organisation, training and equipping of the force, planning of operations, the choosing of targets and the operational support provided. There is no clear evidence that the United States actually exercised such a degree of control as to justify treating the contras as acting on its behalf... Having reached the above conclusion, the Court takes the view that the Contras remain responsible for their acts, in particular the alleged violations by them of humanitarian law. For the United States to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had effective control of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.&quot;

The Court concluded that the United States, despite its objections, was subject to the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction. The Court had ruled on November 26, 1984 by 11 votes to one that it had jurisdiction in the case on the basis of either Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (i.e. compulsory jurisdiction) or the 1956 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Nicaragua. The Charter provides that, in case of doubt, it is for the Court itself to decide whether it has jurisdiction, and that each member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the Court. The Court also ruled by unanimity that the present case was admissible. The United States then announced that it had &quot;decided not to participate in further proceedings in this case.&quot; About a year after the Court&#x27;s jurisdictional decision, the United States took the further, radical step of withdrawing its consent to the Court&#x27;s compulsory jurisdiction, ending its previous 40 year legal commitment to binding international adjudication. The Declaration of acceptance of the general compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice terminated after a 6-month notice of termination delivered by the Secretary of State to the United Nations on October 7, 1985.
Although the Court called on the United States to &quot;cease and to refrain&quot; from the unlawful use of force against Nicaragua and stated that the US was &quot;in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to use force against another state&quot; and ordered it to pay reparations, the United States refused to comply. As a permanent member of the Security Council, the U.S. has been able to block any enforcement mechanism attempted by Nicaragua. On November 3, 1986 the United Nations General Assembly passed, by a vote of 94-3 (El Salvador, Israel and the US voted against), a non-binding resolution urging the US to comply.

=== The ruling ===
On June 27, 1986, the Court made the following ruling:

The Court
# Decides that in adjudicating the dispute brought before it by the Application filed by the Republic of Nicaragua on 9 April 1984, the Court is required to apply the &quot;multilateral treaty reservation&quot; contained in proviso (c) to the declaration of acceptance of jurisdiction made under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court by the Government of the United States of America deposited on 26 August 1946;
# Rejects the justification of collective self-defense maintained by the United States of America in connection with the military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua the subject of this case;
# Decides that the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State;
# Decides that the United States of America, by certain attacks on Nicaraguan territory in 1983–1984, namely attacks on Puerto Sandino on 13 September and 14 October 1983, an attack on Corinto on 10 October 1983; an attack on Potosi Naval Base on 4/5 January 1984, an attack on San Juan del Sur on 7 March 1984; attacks on patrol boats at Puerto Sandino on 28 and 30 March 1984; and an attack on San Juan del Norte on 9 April 1984; and further by those acts of intervention referred to in subparagraph (3) hereof which involve the use of force, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to use force against another State;
# Decides that the United States of America, by directing or authorizing overflights of Nicaraguan territory, and by the acts imputable to the United States referred to in subparagraph (4) hereof, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to violate the sovereignty of another State;
# Decides that, by laying mines in the internal or territorial waters of the Republic of Nicaragua during the first months of 1984, the United States of America has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another State, not to intervene in its affairs, not to violate its sovereignty and not to interrupt peaceful maritime commerce;
# Decides that, by the acts referred to in subparagraph (6) hereof the United States of America has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligations under Article XIX of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States of America and the Republic of Nicaragua signed at Managua on 21 January 1956;
# Decides that the United States of America, by failing to make known the existence and location of the mines laid by it, referred to in subparagraph (6) hereof, has acted in breach of its obligations under customary international law in this respect;

=== Legal clarification and importance ===
The ruling did in many ways clarify issues surrounding prohibition of the use of force and the right of self-defence. Arming and training the Contra was found to be in breach with principles of non-intervention and prohibition of use of force, as was laying mines in Nicaraguan territorial waters.

Nicaragua&#x27;s dealings with the armed opposition in El Salvador, although it might be considered a breach with the principle of non-intervention and the prohibition of use of force, did not constitute &quot;an armed attack&quot;, which is the wording in article 51 justifying the right of self-defence.

The Court considered also the United States claim to be acting in collective self-defence of El Salvador and found the conditions for this not reached as El Salvador never requested the assistance of the United States on the grounds of self-defence.

In regards to laying mines, &quot;...the laying of mines in the waters of another State without any warning or notification is not only an unlawful act but also a breach of the principles of humanitarian law underlying the Hague Convention No. VIII of 1907.&quot;

===How the judges voted===

Votes of Judges – Nicaragua v. United States
===Dissent===
Judge Schwebel argued that the Sandinista government came to power with support of foreign intervention similar to what it was now complaining about. He argued that the Sandinista government achieved international recognition and received large amounts of foreign aid in exchange for commitments they subsequently violated. He cited evidence that the Sandinista government had supported the rebels in El Salvador and wrote that Nicaragua&#x27;s own CIA witness contradicted their assertions that they had never at any point supported the rebels in El Salvador. The CIA witness said that there was no evidence of weapon shipments since early 1981, but Schwebel argued that he could not credibly explain why opponents of Contra aid such as Congressman Boland, who also saw the evidence, believed that weapon shipments were ongoing. He further wrote that Daniel Ortega publicly admitted such shipments in statements in 1985 and 1986. He said there was no dispute that the leadership of the rebels operated in Nicaragua from time to time.

He stated that in August 1981 the U.S. offered to resume aid to Nicaragua and to not support regime change in exchange for Nicaraguan commitments to not support the rebels in El Salvador. These proposals were rejected by the Sandinistas, and Schwebel argued that the U.S. was entitled to take action in collective self-defense with El Salvador by authorizing Contra aid in December 1981. He stated that further U.S. proposals to resolve the issue made in early 1982 were also ignored by the Sandinistas. The Sandinista government in 1983 began advancing proposals in which it would undertake not to support the rebels. Schwebel said that these were coupled with demands that the U.S. cease supporting the lawful government of El Salvador.
He wrote that since early 1985 the U.S. had increasingly made regime change a primary objective but that this was not inconsistent with self-defense because it was reasonable to believe that Nicaragua would not maintain any commitments unless Sandinista power was diluted.

The judge said that both sides of the wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador had committed atrocities. He said the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors was unlawful in regard to third parties, but not Nicaragua.

==Certain witnesses against the US==

===First witness: Commander Luis Carrión===
The first witness called by Nicaragua was Nicaragua&#x27;s first Vice Minister of the Interior, Commander Luis Carrion. Commander Carrion had overall responsibility for state security and was in charge of all government operations in the &quot;principal war zone&quot;. He was responsible for monitoring United States involvement in military and paramilitary activities against Nicaragua, directing Nicaragua&#x27;s military and intelligence efforts against the contra guerrillas.

Commander Carrion began by explaining the condition of the contras prior to United States&#x27; aid in December 1981. Commander Carrion stated that the contras consisted of insignificant bands of poorly armed and poorly organized members of Somoza&#x27;s National Guard, who carried out uncoordinated border raids and rustled cattle (presumably for food).

In December 1981, the U.S. Congress authorized an initial appropriation of 19 million dollars to finance paramilitary operations in Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America. Because of this aid, Commander Carrion stated that the contras began to become centralized and received both training and weapons from the CIA. During 1982 the contra guerrillas engaged the Sandinista armed forces in a series of hit and run border raids and carried out a number of sabotage operations including:
# the destruction of two key bridges in the northern part of Nicaragua, and
# the planting of bombs in Nicaraguan civil aircraft in Mexico and in the baggage area of a Nicaraguan port.

The United States Central Intelligence Agency, and Argentine military officers financed by the CIA, were engaged in the training of the contra forces. The guerrillas received both basic infantry training as well as training in specialized sabotage and demolition for &quot;special operation groups&quot;.

The U.S. Congress apportioned new funds for the contras to the amount of $30 million at the end of 1982. This made it possible for the contra forces to launch a military offensive against Nicaragua. According to Commander Carrion, the offensive known as &quot;C Plan&quot; had the objective of capturing the Nicaraguan border town of Jalapa in order to install a provisional government, which could receive international recognition. This plan failed.

After the failure of the Jalapa offensive the contras changed their tactics from frontal assaults to economic warfare against State farms, coffee plantations, grain storage centers, road junctions, etc.

The CIA began to support the contras by setting up and coordinating a communications and logistical system. The CIA supplied aircraft and the construction of airfields in the Honduran border area next to Nicaragua. This allowed the contras to carry out deep penetration raids into the more developed and populated areas of the Nicaraguan interior. U.S. Army engineers created this airfield. The purpose of these deep penetration attacks upon economic targets was to weaken the Nicaraguan economy, causing a shortages of goods.

As a part of its training program for the contras, the CIA prepared and distributed a manual entitled Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare. This manual included instructions in the &quot;use of implicit and explicit terror&quot;, and in the &quot;selective use of violence for propaganda effects&quot;. Commander Carrion explained that the manual was given to the Contras, &quot;All of these terrorist instructions have the main purpose of alienating the population from the Government through creating a climate of terror and fear, so that nobody would dare support the Government&quot;. The manual calls for the &quot;neutralization&quot; (i.e. assassination) of Sandinista local government officials, judges, etc. for purposes of intimidation. It was openly admitted by the President Reagan in a press conference that the manual had been prepared by a CIA contract employee.

After the United States Congress approved an additional $24 million aid to the contras in December 1983, a new offensive was launched, named Plan Sierra. This offensive involved approximately 7000 members of the contra forces. As in earlier attacks, the initial objective of this offensive was to capture the border town of Jalapa to install a provisional government, which the CIA informed the contras would be immediately recognized by the United States Government. But this contra offensive was also repulsed by the Nicaraguan government forces.

In the beginning of 1984, the contras made a major effort to prevent the harvesting of the coffee crop, which is one of Nicaragua&#x27;s most important export products. Coffee plantations and state farms where coffee is grown were attacked, vehicles were destroyed, and coffee farmers were killed.

Commander Carrion testified that the ability of the contras to carry out military operations was completely dependent upon United States funding, training and logistical support. Carrion stated that the U.S. Government supplied the contras with uniforms, weapons, communications equipment, intelligence, training, and coordination in using this material aid.

In September 1983, CIA operatives blew up Nicaragua&#x27;s only oil pipeline, which was used to transport oil from off-loading facilities to storage tanks on shore. The United States was also directly involved in a large scale sabotage operation directed against Nicaragua&#x27;s oil storage facilities. This last attack was carried out by CIA contract employees termed by that organization as &quot;Unilaterally Controlled Latin Assets&quot; (UCLAs). The CIA personnel were also directly involved in a helicopter attack on a Nicaraguan army training camp. One of the helicopters was shot down by Nicaraguan ground fire resulting in the death of two U.S. citizens.

Commander Carrion testified that the United States was involved in the mining of Nicaragua&#x27;s ports between February – April 1984. The mining operation was carried out by CIA ships directing the operation from international waters, while the actual mining was carried out by CIA employees on board speedboats operating inshore. After the mine-laying was completed the speedboats returned to the mother vessel.

Carrion stated that 3,886 people had been killed and 4,731 wounded in the four years since the contras began their attacks. Carrion estimated property damage at $375 million.

Commander Carrion stated if the United States stopped aid, support and training, this would result in the end of the contras military activities within three months. Asked why he was so sure of this, Commander Carrion answered, &quot;Well, because the contras are an artificial force, artificially set up by the United States, that exists only because it counts on United States direction, on United States training, on United States assistance, on United States weapons, on United States everything...Without that kind of support and direction the contras would simply disband, disorganize, and thus lose their military capacity in a very short time&quot;.

===Second witness: Dr. David MacMichael===
David MacMichael was an expert on counter-insurgency, guerrilla warfare, and Latin American affairs, he was also a witness because he was closely involved with U.S. intelligence activities as a contract employee from March 1981 – April 1983. MacMichael worked for Stanford Research Institute, which was contracted by the U.S. Department of Defense. After this he worked two years for the CIA as a &quot;senior estimates officer&quot;, preparing the National Intelligence Estimate. Dr. MacMichael&#x27;s responsibility was centered upon Central America. He had top-secret clearance. He was qualified and authorized to have access to all relevant U.S. intelligence concerning Central America, including intelligence relating to alleged Nicaraguan support for, and arms shipments to the anti-Government insurgents in El Salvador. He took part in high level meetings of the Latin American affairs office of the CIA. Including a fall 1981 meeting, which submitted the initial plan to set up a 1500-man covert force on the Nicaraguan border, shipping arms from Nicaragua to the El Salvador insurgents. This plan was approved by President Reagan.

&quot;The overall purpose (for the creation of the contras) was to weaken, even destabilize the Nicaraguan Government and thus reduce the menace it allegedly posed to the United States&#x27; interests in Central America...&quot;

Contra paramilitary actions would &quot;hopefully provoke cross-border attacks by Nicaraguan forces and thus serve to demonstrate Nicaragua&#x27;s aggressive nature and possibly call into play the Organization of American States&#x27; provisions (regarding collective self-defense). It was hoped that the Nicaraguan Government would clamp down on civil liberties within Nicaragua itself, arresting its opposition, so demonstrating its allegedly inherent totalitarian nature and thus increase domestic dissent within the country, and further that there would be reaction against United States citizens, particularly against United States diplomatic personnel within Nicaragua and thus to demonstrate the hostility of Nicaragua towards the United States&quot;.

 In response to repeated questions as to whether there was any substantial evidence of the supply of weapons to the guerrilla movement in El Salvador- either directly by the Nicaraguan Government itself-or with the knowledge, approval or authorization of the Nicaraguan Government of either non-official Nicaraguan sources, or by third country nationals inside or outside Nicaragua, using Nicaraguan territory for this purpose, Dr. MacMichael answered that there was no such evidence. In the opinion of the witness it would not have been possible for Nicaragua to send arms to the insurgents in El Salvador in significant amounts (as alleged by the U.S. Government) and over a prolonged period, without this being detected by the U.S. intelligence network in the area...Counsel for Nicaragua, asked the witness several times whether any detection of arms shipments by or through Nicaragua had taken place during the period he was employed by the CIA. (MacMichael) answered repeatedly that there was no such evidence. He also stated that after his employment had terminated, nothing had occurred that would cause him to change his opinion. He termed the evidence that had been publicly disclosed by the U.S. Government concerning Nicaraguan arms deliveries to the El Salvadoran insurgents as both &quot;scanty&quot; and &quot;unreliable&quot;. The witness did however state that based on evidence, which had been gathered immediately prior to his employment with the CIA, evidence he had already actually seen, there was substantial evidence that arms shipments were reaching El Salvador from Nicaragua – with the probable involvement and complicity of the Nicaraguan Government – through late 1980 up until the spring of 1981...But this evidence, which most importantly had included actual seizures of weapons, which could be traced to Nicaragua, as well as documentary evidence and other sources, had completely ceased by early 1981. Since then, no evidence linking Nicaragua to shipments of arms in any substantial quantities had resumed coming in. 

===Third witness: Professor Michael Glennon===
Mr. Glennon testified about a fact-finding mission he had conducted in Nicaragua to investigate alleged human rights violations committed by the Contra guerrillas, sponsored by the International Human Rights Law Group, and the Washington Office on Latin America. Glennon conducted the investigation with Mr. Donald T. Fox who is a New York attorney and a member of the International Commission of Jurists.

They traveled to Nicaragua, visiting the northern region where the majority of contra military operations took place. The two lawyers interviewed around 36 northern frontier residents who had direct experience with the contras. They also spoke with the U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua, and with senior officials of the U.S. Department of State in Washington after returning to the United States.

No hearsay evidence was accepted. Professor Glennon stated that those interviewed were closely questioned, and their evidence was carefully cross-checked with available documentary evidence. Doubtful &quot;testimonies&quot; were rejected, and the results were published in April 1985.

The conclusions of the report were summarized by Glennon in Court:

We found that there is substantial credible evidence that the contras were engaged with some frequency in acts of terroristic violence directed at Nicaraguan civilians. These are individuals who have no connection with the war effort-persons with no economic, political or military significance. These are Individuals who are not caught in the cross-fire between Government and contra forces, but rather individuals who are deliberately targeted by the contras for acts of terror. &quot;Terror&quot; was used in the same sense as in recently enacted United States law, i.e. &quot;an activity that involves a violent act or an act dangerous to human life that Is a violation or the criminal law, and appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, to Influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion, or to affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping.

In talks with U.S. State Department officials, at those in Managua U.S. Embassy, and with officials in Washington, Professor Glennon had inquired whether the U.S. Government had ever investigated human rights abuses by the contras. Professor Glennon testified that no such investigation had ever been conducted, because in the words of a ranking State Department official who he could not name, the U.S. Government maintained a policy of &quot;intentional ignorance&quot; on the matter. State Department officials in Washington- had admitted to Glennon that &quot;it was clear that the level of atrocities was enormous&quot;. Those words &quot;enormous&quot; and &quot;atrocities&quot; were the ranking State Department official&#x27;s words.

===Fourth witness: Father Jean Loison===

Father Jean Loison was a French priest who worked as a nurse in a hospital in the northern frontier region close to Honduras.

Asked whether the contras engaged in acts of violence directed against the civilian population, Father Loison answered:

Yes, I could give you several examples. Near Quilali, at about 30 kilometers east of Quilali, there was a little village called El Coco. The contras arrived, they devastated it, they destroyed and burned everything. They arrived in front of a little house and turned their machinegun fire on it, without bothering to check if there were any people inside. Two children, who had taken fright and hidden under a bed, were hit. I could say the same thing of a man and woman who were hit, this was in the little co-operative of Sacadias Olivas. It was just the same. They too had taken fright and got into bed. Unlike El Coco, the contras had just been on the attack, they had encountered resistance and were now in flight. During their flight they went into a house, and seeing that there were people there, they threw grenade. The man and the woman were killed and one of the children was injured.

About contra kidnappings:

I would say that kidnappings are one of the reasons why some of the peasants have formed themselves into groups. Here (indicates a point on the map) is Quilali. Between Quilali and Uilili, in this region to the north, there are hardly any peasants left of any age to bear arms, because they have all been carried off.

Father Loison described many examples of violence, mostly indiscriminate, directed at the civilian population in the region where he resides. The picture that emerges from his testimony is that the contras engage in brutal violation of minimum standards of humanity. He described murders of unarmed civilians, including women and children, rape followed in many instances by torture or murder, and indiscriminate terror designed to coerce the civilian population. His testimony was similar to various reports including the International Human Rights Law Group, Amnesty International, and others.

===Fifth witness: William Hüper===
William Hüper was Nicaragua&#x27;s Minister of Finance. He testified about Nicaragua economic damage, including the loss of fuel as a result of the attack in the oil storage facilities at Corinto, the damage to Nicaragua&#x27;s commerce as a result of the mining of its ports, and other economic damage.

== UN voting ==
After five vetoes in the Security Council between 1982 and 1985 of resolutions concerning the situation in Nicaragua, the United States made one final veto on 28 October 1986 (France, Thailand, and United Kingdom abstaining) of a resolution calling for full and immediate compliance with the judgment.

Nicaragua brought the matter to the U.N. Security Council, where the United States vetoed a resolution (11 to 1, 3 abstentions) calling on all states to observe international law. Nicaragua also turned to the General Assembly, which passed a resolution 94 to 3 calling for compliance with the World Court ruling. Two states, Israel and El Salvador, joined the United States in opposition. At that time, El Salvador was receiving substantial funding and military advice from the U.S., which was aiming to crush a Sandinista-like revolutionary movement by the FMLN. At the same session, Nicaragua called upon the U.N. to send an independent fact-finding mission to the border to secure international monitoring of the borders after a conflict there; the proposal was rejected by Honduras with U.S. backing. A year later, on November 12, 1987, the General Assembly again called for &quot;full and immediate compliance&quot; with the World Court decision. This time only Israel joined the United States in opposing adherence to the ruling.

== U.S. defense and response ==
The United States refused to participate in the merits phase of the proceedings, but the Court found that the US refusal did not prevent it from deciding the case. The Court also rejected the United States defense that its action constituted collective self-defense.
The United States argued that the Court did not have jurisdiction, with U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick dismissing the Court as a &quot;semi-legal, semi-juridical, semi-political body, which nations sometimes accept and sometimes don&#x27;t.&quot;

The United States had signed the treaty accepting the Court&#x27;s decision as binding, but with the exception that the court would not have the power to hear cases based on multilateral treaty obligations unless it involved all parties to the treaty affected by that decision or the United States specially agreed to jurisdiction. The court found that it was obliged to apply this exception and refused to take on claims by Nicaragua based on the United Nations Charter and Organization of American States charter, but concluded that it could still decide the case based on customary international law obligations with 11-4 majority.

When a similar but crucially non-binding resolution was brought before the United Nations General Assembly on 3 November it was passed. Only El Salvador and Israel voted with the U.S. against it. El Salvador&#x27;s ruling junta was at that time receiving substantial funding and military advisement from the U.S., which was aiming to crush a Sandinista-like revolutionary movement by the FMLN. In spite of this resolution, the U.S. still chose not to pay the fine.

In response to the ICJ&#x27;s decision that US aid to the contra rebels violated international law, US State Department lawyer, Abraham Sofaer, said that the US would no longer recognize the ICJ&#x27;s &#x27;compulsory jurisdiction&#x27; authority. Sofaer said &quot;We felt the Nicaragua case was an unfortunate signal to us that we should be concerned about our security interests and about the use of the court for political-public relations purposes. . . . The President does not want the court used for those purposes--at the same time, he and others in this Administration want to continue to use the court for its intended purposes&quot;. Paul Reichler, one of the lawyers representing Nicaragua in the case, said: &quot;It’s another indication that this Administration has no regard for international law--when international law conflicts with a foreign policy objective of the Administration, they will throw international law into the waste basket&quot;.

==Significance==

===Third-party interpretations===
Professor of International Law, Anthony D&#x27;Amato, writing for the &quot;American Journal of International Law&quot; (Vol. 80, 1986), commented on this case, stating that &quot;law would collapse if defendants could only be sued when they agreed to be sued, and the proper measurement of that collapse would be not just the drastically diminished number of cases but also the necessary restructuring of a vast system of legal transactions and relations predicated on the availability of courts as a last resort. There would be talk of a return to the law of the jungle.&quot; The author also notes that the case resulted in an unusual candor. A month after the announced withdrawal, Secretary of State Shultz suggested, and President Reagan later confirmed in a press conference, that the goal of U.S. policy was to overthrow the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua. Although this was what Nicaragua had alleged to be the U.S. goal, while the case was actively pending, the United States could not concede that goal without serious risk of undermining its litigating position.

<text>A naturalistic planned language is an &quot;a posteriori&quot; constructed language specifically devised to reproduce the commonalities in morphology and vocabulary from a group of closely related languages, usually with the idea that such a language will be easier to use passively – in many cases, without prior study – by speakers of one or more languages in the group.

The term most commonly applies to planned languages predominantly based on the Romance languages, best known of which are Interlingue (previously known as &quot;Occidental&quot;) and Interlingua. Both were designed to serve as international auxiliary languages. However, there are also languages intended for speakers of a particular language family (zonal constructed languages), including Pan-Germanic, Pan-Slavic and even Pan-Celtic naturalistic planned languages.

Since the creation of such a language often includes shared idiosyncrasies from the source languages, active use seems to be generally more difficult to learn than for schematic planned languages, though because of grammatical simplification considerably easier than for ethnic languages of the same type.

<doc id="22035" wikidata="Q1751823" url="?curid=22035" title="No-cloning theorem">
<text>In physics, the no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state, a statement which has profound implications in the field of quantum computing among others. The theorem is an evolution of the 1970 no-go theorem authored by James Park, in which he demonstrates that a non-disturbing measurement scheme which is both simple and perfect cannot exist (the same result would be independently derived in 1982 by William Wootters and Wojciech H. Zurek as well as Dennis Dieks the same year). The aforementioned theorems do not preclude the state of one system becoming entangled with the state of another as cloning specifically refers to the creation of a separable state with identical factors. For example, one might use the controlled NOT gate and the Walsh–Hadamard gate to entangle two qubits without violating the no-cloning theorem as no well-defined state may be defined in terms of a subsystem of an entangled state. The no-cloning theorem (as generally understood) concerns only pure states whereas the generalized statement regarding mixed states is known as the no-broadcast theorem. The no-cloning theorem has a time-reversed dual, the no-deleting theorem.

== History ==

According to Asher Peres and David Kaiser, the publication of the 1982 proof of the no-cloning theorem by Wootters and Zurek and by Dieks was prompted by a proposal of Nick Herbert for a superluminal communication device using quantum entanglement, and Giancarlo Ghirardi had proven the theorem 18 months prior to the published proof by Wootters and Zurek in his referee report to said proposal (as evidenced by a letter from the editor). However, Juan Ortigoso pointed out in 2018 that a complete proof along with an interpretation in terms of the lack of simple nondisturbing measurements in quantum mechanics was already delivered by Park in 1970.

== Theorem and proof ==
Suppose we have two quantum systems &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; with a common Hilbert space formula_1. Suppose we want to have a procedure to copy the state formula_2 of quantum system &quot;A&quot;, over the state formula_3 of quantum system &quot;B,&quot; for any original state formula_2 (see bra–ket notation). That is, beginning with the state formula_5, we want to end up with the state formula_6. To make a &quot;copy&quot; of the state &quot;A&quot;, we combine it with system &quot;B&quot; in some unknown initial, or blank, state formula_3 independent of formula_2, of which we have no prior knowledge.

The state of the initial composite system is then described by the following tensor product:
formula_9
(in the following we will omit the formula_10 symbol and keep it implicit).

There are only two permissible quantum operations with which we may manipulate the composite system:

* We can perform an observation, which irreversibly collapses the system into some eigenstate of an observable, corrupting the information contained in the qubit(s). This is obviously not what we want.
* Alternatively, we could control the Hamiltonian of the &quot;combined&quot; system, and thus the time-evolution operator &quot;U&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), e.g. for a time-independent Hamiltonian, Evolving up to some fixed time formula_11 yields a unitary operator &quot;U&quot; on the Hilbert space of the combined system. However, no such unitary operator &quot;U&quot; can clone all states.

The no-cloning theorem answers the following question in the negative: Is it possible to construct a unitary operator &quot;U&quot;, acting on formula_12, under which the state the system B is in always evolves into the state the system A is in, &quot;regardless&quot; of the state system A is in?

The extra phase factor expresses the fact that a quantum-mechanical state defines a normalised vector in Hilbert space only up to a phase factor i.e. as an element of projectivised Hilbert space.

To prove the theorem, we select an arbitrary pair of states formula_2 and formula_14 in the Hilbert space formula_15. Because &quot;U&quot; is supposed to be unitary, we would have
formula_16
Since the quantum state formula_17 is assumed to be normalized, we thus get
formula_18

This implies that either formula_19 or formula_20. Hence by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality either formula_21 or formula_22 is orthogonal to formula_23. However, this cannot be the case for two &quot;arbitrary&quot; states. Therefore, a single universal &quot;U&quot; cannot clone a &quot;general&quot; quantum state. This proves the no-cloning theorem.

Take a qubit for example. It can be represented by two complex numbers, called probability amplitudes (normalised to 1), that is three real numbers (two polar angles and one radius). Copying three numbers on a classical computer using any copy and paste operation is trivial (up to a finite precision) but the problem manifests if the qubit is unitarily transformed (e.g. by the Hadamard quantum gate) to be polarised (which unitary transformation is a surjective isometry). In such a case the qubit can be represented by just two real numbers (one polar angle and one radius equal to 1), while the value of the third can be arbitrary in such a representation. Yet a realisation of a qubit (polarisation-encoded photon, for example) is capable of storing the whole qubit information support within its &quot;structure&quot;. Thus no single universal unitary evolution &quot;U&quot; can clone an arbitrary quantum state according to the no-cloning theorem. It would have to depend on the transformed qubit (initial) state and thus would not have been &quot;universal&quot;.

== Generalization ==

In the statement of the theorem, two assumptions were made: the state to be copied is a pure state and the proposed copier acts via unitary time evolution. These assumptions cause no loss of generality. If the state to be copied is a mixed state, it can be &quot;purified,&quot; i.e. treated as a pure state of a larger system. Alternately, a different proof can be given that works directly with mixed states; in this case, the theorem is often known as the no-broadcast theorem. Similarly, an arbitrary quantum operation can be implemented via introducing an ancilla and performing a suitable unitary evolution. Thus the no-cloning theorem holds in full generality.

== Consequences ==
*The no-cloning theorem prevents the use of certain classical error correction techniques on quantum states. For example, backup copies of a state in the middle of a quantum computation cannot be created and used for correcting subsequent errors. Error correction is vital for practical quantum computing, and for some time it was unclear whether or not it was possible. In 1995, Shor and Steane showed that it is, by independently devising the first quantum error correcting codes, which circumvent the no-cloning theorem.
*Similarly, cloning would violate the no-teleportation theorem, which says that it is impossible to convert a quantum state into a sequence of classical bits (even an infinite sequence of bits), copy those bits to some new location, and recreate a copy of the original quantum state in the new location. This should not be confused with entanglement-assisted teleportation, which does allow a quantum state to be destroyed in one location, and an exact copy to be recreated in another location.
* The no-cloning theorem is implied by the no-communication theorem, which states that quantum entanglement cannot be used to transmit classical information (whether superluminally, or slower). That is, cloning, together with entanglement, would allow such communication to occur. To see this, consider the EPR thought experiment, and suppose quantum states could be cloned. Assume parts of a maximally entangled Bell state are distributed to Alice and Bob. Alice could send bits to Bob in the following way: If Alice wishes to transmit a &quot;0&quot;, she measures the spin of her electron in the z direction, collapsing Bob&#x27;s state to either formula_24 or formula_25. To transmit &quot;1&quot;, Alice does nothing to her qubit. Bob creates many copies of his electron&#x27;s state, and measures the spin of each copy in the z direction. Bob will know that Alice has transmitted a &quot;0&quot; if all his measurements produce the same result; otherwise, his measurements will have outcomes formula_24 or formula_25 with equal probability. This would allow Alice and Bob to communicate classical bits between each other (possibly across space-like separations, violating causality).
* The no cloning theorem prevents an interpretation of the holographic principle for black holes as meaning that there are two copies of information, one lying at the event horizon and the other in the black hole interior. This leads to more radical interpretations, such as black hole complementarity.

== Imperfect cloning ==
Even though it is impossible to make perfect copies of an unknown quantum state, it is possible to produce imperfect copies. This can be done by coupling a larger auxiliary system to the system that is to be cloned, and applying a unitary transformation to the combined system. If the unitary transformation is chosen correctly, several components of the combined system will evolve into approximate copies of the original system. In 1996, V. Buzek and M. Hillery showed that a universal cloning machine can make a clone of an unknown state with the surprisingly high fidelity of 5/6.

Imperfect quantum cloning can be used as an eavesdropping attack on quantum cryptography protocols, among other uses in quantum information science.

<text>Norman Hackerman (March 2, 1912 – June 16, 2007) was an American chemist, professor, and academic administrator who served as the 18th President of the University of Texas at Austin (1967–1970) and later as the 4th President of Rice University (1970–1985). He was an internationally known expert in metal corrosion.

==Biography==
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, he was the only son of Jacob Hackerman and Anna Raffel, immigrants from the Baltic regions of the Russian Empire that later became Estonia and Latvia, respectively.

Hackerman earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1932 and his doctor&#x27;s degree in chemistry in 1935 from Johns Hopkins University. He taught at Johns Hopkins, Loyola College in Baltimore and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, before working on the Manhattan Project in World War II.

He joined the University of Texas in 1945 as an assistant professor of chemistry, became an associate professor in 1946, a full professor in 1950, a department chair in 1952, dean of research in 1960, vice president and provost in 1961, and vice chancellor for academic affairs for the University of Texas System in 1963. Hackerman left the University of Texas in 1970 for Rice, where he retired 15 years later. He was named professor emeritus of chemistry at the University of Texas in 1985 and taught classes until the end of his life.

He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among his many honors are the Olin Palladium Award of the Electrochemical Society, the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Chemists (1978), the Charles Lathrop Parsons Award, the Vannevar Bush Award and the National Medal of Science. He was awarded the Acheson Award by the Electrochemical Society in 1984.

Hackerman served on advisory committees and boards of several technical societies and government agencies, including the National Science Board, the Texas Governor&#x27;s Task Force on Higher Education and the Scientific Advisory Board of the Welch Foundation. He also served as editor of the &quot;Journal of the Electrochemical Society&quot; and as president of the Electrochemical Society.

== Family ==
Hackerman&#x27;s wife of 61 years, Gene Coulbourn, died in 2002; they had three daughters and one son.

== Legacy ==
In 1982 The Electrochemical Society created the Norman Hackerman Young Author Award to honor the best paper published in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society for a topic in the field of electrochemical science and technology by a young author or authors. In 2000 the Welch Foundation created the Norman Hackerman Award in Chemical Research to recognize the work of young researchers in Texas. The Rice Board of Trustees established the Norman Hackerman Fellowship in Chemistry in honor of Hackerman&#x27;s 90th birthday in 2002. In 2008, the original Experimental Science Building at the University of Texas at Austin campus was demolished and rebuilt as the Norman Hackerman Experimental Science Building in his name and honor. The building was completed in late 2010, with the opening and dedication ceremony on March 2, 2011, which was both Hackerman&#x27;s 99th Birthday and the 175th Anniversary of Texas Independence. The main building at the J. Erik Jonsson Center of the National Academy of Sciences is Hackerman House, named in his honor. Hackerman House overlooks Quissett Harbor in Woods Hole MA, on Cape Cod.

<doc id="22037" wikidata="Q1268029" url="?curid=22037" title="N-ray">
<text>N-rays (or N rays) were a hypothesized form of radiation described by French physicist Prosper-René Blondlot in 1903. They were initially confirmed by others, but subsequently found to be illusory.

== Background ==
The N-ray affair occurred shortly after a series of major breakthroughs in experimental physics. Victor Schumann discovered vacuum ultraviolet radiation in 1893, Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays in 1895, Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896, and, in 1897, J. J. Thomson discovered electrons, showing that they were the constituents of cathode rays. This created an expectation within the scientific community that other forms of radiation might be discovered.

At this time, Prosper-René Blondlot was a professor of physics at the University of Nancy studying electromagnetic radiation. Blondlot was a respected member of the scientific community: he was one of eight physicists who were corresponding members of the French Academy of Sciences and was awarded the Academy&#x27;s Gaston Planté prize in 1893 and the LaCaze prize in 1899. His attempts to measure the speed of electromagnetic waves were commended by Thomson and Henri Poincaré. Blondlot began investigating the nature of X-rays shortly after their discovery, trying to determine whether they behaved as particles or electromagnetic waves. (This was before wave-particle duality became widely accepted among scientists.)

== Discovery ==
In 1903, Blondlot announced his discovery while working at the University of Nancy and attempting to polarize X-rays. He had perceived changes in the brightness of an electric spark in a spark gap placed in an X-ray beam which he photographed, and he later attributed to the novel form of radiation, naming this the &quot;N-rays&quot; for the University of Nancy. Blondlot, Augustin Charpentier, Arsène d&#x27;Arsonval, and approximately 120 other scientists in 300 published articles claimed to be able to detect N-rays emanating from most substances, including the human body, with the peculiar exceptions that they were not emitted by green wood and by some treated metals. Most researchers of the subject at the time used the perceived light of a dim phosphorescent surface as &quot;detectors&quot;, although work in the period clearly showed the change in brightness to be a physiological phenomenon rather than some actual change in the level of illumination. Physicists Gustave le Bon and P. Audollet and spiritualist Carl Huter even claimed the discovery as their own, leading to a commission of the Académie des sciences to decide priority.

==Response==
The &quot;discovery&quot; excited international interest and many physicists worked to replicate the effects. However, the notable physicists Lord Kelvin, William Crookes, Otto Lummer, and Heinrich Rubens failed to do so. Following his own failure, self-described as &quot;wasting a whole morning&quot;, the American physicist Robert W. Wood, who had a reputation as a popular &quot;debunker&quot; of nonsense during the period, was prevailed upon by the British journal &quot;Nature&quot; to travel to Blondlot&#x27;s laboratory in France to investigate further. Wood suggested that Rubens should go since he had been the most embarrassed when Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany asked him to repeat the French experiments and, after two weeks, Rubens had to report his failure to do so. Rubens, however, felt it would look better if Wood went since Blondlot had been most polite in answering his many questions.

In the darkened room during Blondlot&#x27;s demonstration, Wood surreptitiously removed an essential prism from the experimental apparatus, yet the experimenters still said that they observed N-rays. Wood also stealthily swapped a large file that was supposed to be giving off N-rays with an inert piece of wood, yet the N-rays were still &quot;observed&quot;. His report on these investigations were published in &quot;Nature&quot;,
and they suggested that the N-rays were a purely subjective phenomenon, with the scientists involved having recorded data that matched their expectations. There is reason to believe that Blondlot in particular was misled by his laboratory assistant, who confirmed all observations. By 1905, no one outside of Nancy believed in N-rays, but Blondlot himself is reported to have still been convinced of their existence in 1926. Martin Gardner, making reference to Wood&#x27;s biographer William Seabrook&#x27;s account of the affair, attributed a subsequent decline in mental health and eventual death of Blondlot to the resulting scandal, but there is evidence that this is at least some exaggeration of the facts.

The term &quot;N-ray&quot; was added to dictionaries upon its announcement and was described as a real phenomenon until at least the 1940s. For instance, the 1946 Webster&#x27;s Dictionary defined it as &quot;An emanation or radiation from certain hot bodies which increases the luminosity without increasing the temperature: as yet, not fully determined.&quot;

==Significance==

The incident is used as a cautionary tale among scientists on the dangers of error introduced by experimenter bias. N-rays were cited as an example of pathological science by Irving Langmuir. Nearly identical properties of an equally unknown radiation had been recorded about 50 years before in another country by Carl Reichenbach in his treatise &quot;Researches on Magnetism, Electricity, Heat, Light, Crystallization, and Chemical Attraction in their relations to the Vital Force&quot; in 1850, and before that in Vienna by Franz Mesmer in his &quot;Mémoire on the Discovery of Animal-Magnetism&quot; in 1779. It is clear that Reichenbach was aware of Mesmer&#x27;s work and that researchers in Paris working with Blondlot were aware of Reichenbach&#x27;s work, although there is no proof that Blondlot was personally aware of it.

A park in central Nancy is named after Blondlot. He left his house and garden to the city, which transformed it into a public park. James Randi reported that many citizens of Nancy and members of the faculty at the university did not remember having heard about N-rays or of Blondlot.

In the 2018 book &quot;The Skeptics&#x27; Guide to the Universe&quot;, the section titled &quot;Iconic Cautionary Tales from History&quot; recounts the story of the &quot;discovery&quot; of N-rays. A review of the book in &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; reported that the book uses the N-rays incident to reveal the danger of &quot;scientists insufficiently applying skepticism&quot;, because &quot;Three hundred scientific papers were published by one hundred experimenters over three years, all declaring this imaginary phenomenon to be real.&quot;

<doc id="22039" wikidata="Q342462" url="?curid=22039" title="Nikolai Kuznetsov (admiral)">
<text>Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov (; 24 July 1904 – 6 December 1974) was a Soviet naval officer who achieved the rank of Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union and served as People&#x27;s Commissar of the Navy during the Winter War and the Second World War. The N. G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy and the Russian aircraft carrier , as well as the Kuznetsov-class carrier class, are named in his honor.

==Biography==

=== Early years and career ===
Kuznetsov was born in a peasant family in the village of Medvedki, Velikoustyuzhsky Uyezd, Vologda Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Kotlassky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia).

In 1919, Kuznetsov joined the Northern Dvina Naval Flotilla, having added two years to his age to make himself eligible to serve. In 1920, he was stationed at Petrograd and in 1924, as a member of a naval unit, he attended the funeral ceremony of Vladimir Lenin.

That same year, he joined the Communist Party.

Upon graduation from the Frunze Higher Naval School in 1926, Kuznetsov served on the cruiser , first as watch officer and then as First Lieutenant. In 1932, he graduated from the Naval College after studying operational tactics. Upon graduation, he was offered two options – a desk job with the general staff or a command post on a ship.

Kuznetsov successfully applied for the post of executive officer on the cruiser . Within a year, the young officer earned his next promotion. In 1934, he returned to the &quot;Chervona Ukraina&quot;, this time as her commander. Under Kuznetsov, the ship became an outstanding example of discipline and organization, quickly drawing attention to her young captain.

From 5 September 1936 to 15 August 1937, Kuznetsov served as the Soviet naval attaché and chief naval advisor to Republican Spain. During the early stages of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939 he developed a strong dislike of fascism.

On returning home, on January 10, 1938, he was promoted to the rank of flag officer, 2nd rank, and given command of the Pacific Fleet. While in this position, he came face to face with Stalin&#x27;s purge of the military. Kuznetsov himself was never implicated, but many of the officers under his command were. Kuznetsov resisted the purges at every step, and his intervention saved the lives of many Soviet officers.

On 28 April 1939, Kuznetsov, still only thirty-four, was appointed the People&#x27;s Commissar (Minister) of the Navy, a post he would hold throughout the Second World War until 1946. In 1939, despite Stalin&#x27;s negative attitude to the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy, Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov ordered the return of the Naval Engineering faculty from Moscow to Leningrad, and set up the Military Engineering-Technical University to educate engineers for the construction of naval bases.

===The Second World War===
Kuznetsov played a crucial role during the first hours of the war – at this pivotal moment, his resolve and blatant disregard for orders averted the destruction of the Soviet Navy. By June 21, 1941, Kuznetzov was convinced of the inevitability of war with Nazi Germany. On the same day Semyon Timoshenko and Georgy Zhukov issued a directive prohibiting Soviet commanders from responding to &quot;German provocations&quot;. The Navy, however, constituted a distinct ministry (narkomat), and thus Kuznetsov held a position which was technically outside the direct chain of command. He utilized this fact in a very bold move.

Shortly after midnight on the morning of June 22, Kuznetsov ordered all Soviet fleets to battle readiness. At 3:15 am that same morning, the Wehrmacht began Operation Barbarossa. The Soviet Navy was the only branch of the military in the highest state of combat readiness at the start of the initial German push.

In the following two years, Kuznetsov&#x27;s primary concern was the protection of the Caucasus from a German invasion. Throughout the war, the Black Sea remained the primary theater of operations for the Soviet Navy. During the war years Kuznetsov honed Soviet methods of amphibious assault. A notable subordinate in the Black Sea and in command of the Azov Flotilla was S.G. Gorshkov who would later succeed him as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. In May 1944 he was given the rank of Admiral of the Fleet – a newly created position initially equated to that of a four-star general. In the same year, Kuznetsov was given the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. On May 31, 1945, his rank was equated to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union with a similar insignia. In August 1945, he took part in Operation August Storm in the Far East, helping to provide functions for the Soviet Navy fleet for Commander-in-Chief of USSR Forces in the Far East Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky.

===The first fall===
From 1946 to 1947 he was the Deputy Minister of the USSR Armed Forces and Commander-in-Chief of the Naval Forces.

In 1947 he was removed from his post on Stalin&#x27;s orders and in 1948 he, as well as several other admirals were put on trial by the Naval Tribunal. Kuznetsov was demoted to vice-admiral, while the other admirals received prison sentences of varying length.

In 1951 Stalin ended Kuznetsov&#x27;s pariah status, once again placing him in command of the Navy (as the Minister of the Navy of the USSR), but without restoring his military rank, which was returned to him upon Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953. In the same year, he became the First Deputy Minister of Defense of the USSR. In 1955, Kuznetsov was made Commander-in-Chief of the Naval Forces. His rank was raised to Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union and he was awarded the Marshal&#x27;s Star.

===The second fall and retirement===
His newfound prominence brought him into direct conflict with now Defense Minister Marshal Zhukov, with whom he had clashed during the war years. On December 8, 1955, using the loss of the battleship as a pretext, Zhukov removed the Admiral from his post. The commission that inspected the ship&#x27;s loss was headed by Vyacheslav Malyshev and its findings were used by Zhukov to blame Kuznetsov. In February 1956 he was again demoted to the rank of vice-admiral, retired and expressly forbidden &quot;any and all work connected with the navy.&quot;

During his retirement he wrote and published many essays and articles, as well as several longer works, including his memoirs and an officially sanctioned book, &quot;With a Course for Victory&quot;, which dealt with the Patriotic War. His memoirs, unlike those of many other prominent leaders, were written by him personally and are noted for their style.

Kuznetsov also authored several books on the war, on Stalin&#x27;s repressions, and on the navy which were published posthumously. In these he was highly critical of the Party&#x27;s interference in the internal affairs of the military, and insisted that &quot;the state must be ruled by law.&quot;

===Rehabilitation and legacy===
After the retirement of Zhukov in 1957, and of Khrushchev in 1964, a group of naval veterans began a campaign addressed to the Soviet leadership to restore Kuznetsov&#x27;s rank, with all benefits, and to make him one of the General Inspectors of the Ministry of Defence. Not until July 26, 1988, under Andrey Gromyko did the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR reinstate Kuznetsov to his former rank of Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union. Kuznetsov is now recognized as one of the most prominent men in the history of the Soviet and, today, of the Russian Navy. In recognition, the Russian Navy&#x27;s largest surface warship, its only remaining aircraft carrier, is named in his honor.

===Death===
Kuznetsov died on 6 December 1974 in Moscow, at aged 70 and was buried with full military honors at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

<doc id="22042" wikidata="Q3111078" url="?curid=22042" title="Nuon (DVD technology)">
<text>Nuon (stylized as NUON) is a technology developed by VM Labs that adds features to a DVD player. In addition to viewing DVDs, one can play 3D video games and use enhanced DVD navigational tools such as zoom and smooth scanning of DVD playback. One could also play CDs while the Nuon graphics processor generates synchronized graphics on the screen. There were plans to provide Internet access capability in the next generation of Nuon-equipped DVD players.

==History==

Nuon was first unveiled under the codename &quot;Project X&quot;, set for a release during the 1998 Christmas shopping season, and was featured in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s 1999 Video Game Buyer&#x27;s Guide. One of the Nuon&#x27;s main software developers was Jeff Minter, who created a version of &quot;Tempest&quot; titled &quot;Tempest 3000&quot; for the system and the built-in VLM-2 audio visualizer. Manufacturing of the hardware was handled by several original equipment manufacturers.

The system&#x27;s software development kit (SDK) was priced at roughly one-third of that of the PlayStation SDK, and following a strong showing at the 1998 Consumer Electronics Show, VM Labs shipped out several dozen SDKs to developers.

When it was first announced, the Nuon&#x27;s creators envisioned it as a competitor for the upcoming video game consoles from the leading manufacturers. However, the Nuon platform was primarily marketed as an expanded DVD format. A large majority of Nuon players that were sold in fact resembled typical consumer DVD players with the only noticeable difference being a Nuon logo. Nuon players offered a number of features that were not available on other DVD players when playing standard DVD-formatted titles. These included very smooth forward and reverse functionality and the ability to smoothly zoom in and out of sections of the video image. In addition, Nuon provided a software platform to DVD authors to provide interactive software like features to their titles.

In North America, Nuon was used in the Samsung DVD-N501 and DVD-N2000 models; they also released several models in other parts of the world: DVD-N504 (Europe), DVD N505 (Europe), and DVD-N591 (Korea). Toshiba released the SD-2300 DVD player, and there are two RCA models, the DRC300N and DRC480N. The Nuon was also used in Motorola&#x27;s Streamaster 5000 &quot;Digital DNA&quot; set-top box.

Nuon was created by VM Labs, whose assets were sold to Genesis Microchip in April 2002. By November 2004, there were no Nuon-enabled DVD players shipping and no new Nuon software titles released or in development.

===Specification===
*Four 128-bit 54 MHz or 108 MHz Nuon MPE (Media Processing Element) very long instruction word processors supporting parallel operations on (at most) 32-bit scalars. An MPE&#x27;s register file contains eight 128-bit registers, which can be used to store vectors of that size (composed of 4 scalars), or be partitioned down to offer thirty-two 32-bit (scalar) registers, or eight packets of 3 (pixel) or 4 (&quot;small&quot;) 16-bit vectors. Each MPE operates on RAM that is local to itself, but MPEs 1 and 4 can directly operate on data located in system memory. Those same specific MPEs can use their memories as configurable caches, and have access to additional tag RAM for that purpose. MPEs have a hardware multiply unit, but no hardware division. There is no hardware support for floating point computation. Some report(s) suggested that a certain model had sported a 333+ MHz clock frequency but it was never released widely.
*MCS-251 microcontroller for background task
*32 MB 8-bit Fast Page DRAM at 33 MHz, 512 KB sound RAM and 24 KB programmable ROM
*2x 3d Media GL MPE with 8 MB 32-bit video RAM at 66 MHz.
*64~256 MB writable ROM and optional hard drive (up to 137 GB) 
*Optical drive support DVD or CD-R

===Peripherals and accessories===
Peripherals for Nuon-enhanced DVD players included the following:
*Logitech Gamepad
*Pro-elite controller
*AirPlay wireless controller
*Stealth controller
*Warrior Digital-D pad
*controller extension cable
*port replicator to move the Nuon ports to anywhere desired

===Released movies===
Only four DVD releases utilized Nuon technology. All of them were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment:

*&quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot;
*&quot;Bedazzled&quot; (2000 remake)
*&quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;
*&quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (2001 remake, Bug Free Version UPC - 024543028987)

==Homebrew development==
In late 2001, VM Labs released an SDK which allowed developers to program apps/games for their Nuon system. Only the Samsung DVD-N501/DVDN504/DVDN505 and RCA DRC300N/DRC480N can load homebrew games.

Some homebrew titles have been created for or ported to Nuon. They are not commercially available and require the user to burn the material to a Nuon-compatible CD-R.
