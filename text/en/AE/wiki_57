<text>In computing, a namespace is a set of signs (&quot;names&quot;) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.

Namespaces are commonly structured as hierarchies to allow reuse of names in different contexts. As an analogy, consider a system of naming of people where each person has a given name, as well as a family name shared with their relatives. If the first names of family members are unique only within each family, then each person can be uniquely identified by the combination of first name and family name; there is only one Jane Doe, though there may be many Janes. Within the namespace of the Doe family, just &quot;Jane&quot; suffices to unambiguously designate this person, while within the &quot;global&quot; namespace of all people, the full name must be used.

Prominent examples for namespaces include file systems, which assign names to files.
Some programming languages organize their variables and subroutines in namespaces.
Computer networks and distributed systems assign names to resources, such as computers, printers, websites, and remote files. Operating systems can partition kernel resources by isolated namespaces to support virtualization containers.

Similarly, hierarchical file systems organize files in directories. Each directory is a separate namespace, so that the directories &quot;letters&quot; and &quot;invoices&quot; may both contain a file &quot;to_jane&quot;.

In computer programming, namespaces are typically employed for the purpose of grouping symbols and identifiers around a particular functionality and to avoid name collisions between multiple identifiers that share the same name.

In networking, the Domain Name System organizes websites (and other resources) into hierarchical namespaces.

==Name conflicts==
Element names are defined by the developer. This often results in a conflict when trying to mix XML documents from different XML applications.

This XML carries HTML table information:

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Apples&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Oranges&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This XML carries information about a table (i.e. a piece of furniture):

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;Mahogany Coffee Table&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;width&gt;80&lt;/width&gt;
 &lt;length&gt;120&lt;/length&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
If these XML fragments were added together, there would be a name conflict. Both contain a element, but the elements have different content and meaning.

An XML parser will not know how to handle these differences.

===Solution via prefix===
Name conflicts in XML can easily be avoided using a name prefix.

The following XML distinguishes between information about the HTML table and furniture by prefixing &quot;h&quot; and &quot;f&quot; at the beginning of the elements.

&lt;h:table&gt;
 &lt;h:tr&gt;
 &lt;h:td&gt;Apples&lt;/h:td&gt;
 &lt;h:td&gt;Oranges&lt;/h:td&gt;
 &lt;/h:tr&gt;
&lt;/h:table&gt;

&lt;f:table&gt;
 &lt;f:name&gt;Mahogany Coffee Table&lt;/f:name&gt;
 &lt;f:width&gt;80&lt;/f:width&gt;
 &lt;f:length&gt;120&lt;/f:length&gt;
&lt;/f:table&gt;
==Naming system==
A name in a namespace consists of a namespace name and a local name. The namespace name is usually applied as a prefix to the local name.

In augmented Backus–Naur form:

name = &lt;namespace name&gt; separator &lt;local name&gt;

When local names are used by themselves, name resolution is used to decide which (if any) particular name is alluded to by some particular local name.

===Examples===

===Delegation===
Delegation of responsibilities between parties is important in real-world applications, such as the structure of the World Wide Web. Namespaces allow delegation of identifier assignment to multiple name issuing organisations whilst retaining global uniqueness. A central Registration authority registers the assigned namespace names allocated. Each namespace name is allocated to an organisation which is subsequently responsible for the assignment of names in their allocated namespace. This organisation may be a name issuing organisation that assign the names themselves, or another Registration authority which further delegates parts of their namespace to different organisations.

===Hierarchy===
A naming scheme that allows subdelegation of namespaces to third parties is a hierarchical namespace.

A hierarchy is recursive if the syntax for the namespace names is the same for each subdelegation. An example of a recursive hierarchy is the Domain name system.

An example of a non-recursive hierarchy are Uniform Resource Name representing an Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) number.

===Namespace versus scope===
A namespace name may provide context (scope in computer science) to a name, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. However, the context of a name may also be provided by other factors, such as the location where it occurs or the syntax of the name.

==In programming languages== 

For many programming languages, namespace is a context for their identifiers. In an operating system, an example of namespace is a directory. Each name in a directory uniquely identifies one file or subdirectory.

As a rule, names in a namespace cannot have more than one meaning; that is, different meanings cannot share the same name in the same namespace. A namespace is also called a context, because the same name in different namespaces can have different meanings, each one appropriate for its namespace.

Following are other characteristics of namespaces:
* Names in the namespace can represent objects as well as concepts, be the namespace a natural or ethnic language, a constructed language, the technical terminology of a profession, a dialect, a sociolect, or an artificial language (e.g., a programming language).
* In the Java programming language, identifiers that appear in namespaces have a short (local) name and a unique long &quot;qualified&quot; name for use outside the namespace.
* Some compilers (for languages such as C++) combine namespaces and names for internal use in the compiler in a process called &quot;name mangling&quot;.

As well as its abstract language technical usage as described above, some languages have a specific keyword used for explicit namespace control, amongst other uses. Below is an example of a namespace in C++:
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

// This is how one brings a name into the current scope. In this case, it&#x27;s
// bringing them into global scope.
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

namespace box1 {
 int box_side = 4;

namespace box2 {
 int box_side = 12;

int main() {
 int box_side = 42;
 cout « box1::box_side « endl; // Outputs 4.
 cout « box2::box_side « endl; // Outputs 12.
 cout « box_side « endl; // Outputs 42.


===Computer-science considerations===
A namespace in computer science (sometimes also called a name scope) is an abstract container or environment created to hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers or symbols (i.e. names). An identifier defined in a namespace is associated only with that namespace. The same identifier can be independently defined in multiple namespaces. That is, an identifier defined in one namespace may or may not have the same meaning as the same identifier defined in another namespace. Languages that support namespaces specify the rules that determine to which namespace an identifier (not its definition) belongs.

This concept can be illustrated with an analogy. Imagine that two companies, X and Y, each assign ID numbers to their employees. X should not have two employees with the same ID number, and likewise for Y; but it is not a problem for the same ID number to be used at both companies. For example, if Bill works for company X and Jane works for company Y, then it is not a problem for each of them to be employee #123. In this analogy, the ID number is the identifier, and the company serves as the namespace. It does not cause problems for the same identifier to identify a different person in each namespace.

In large computer programs or documents it is common to have hundreds or thousands of identifiers. Namespaces (or a similar technique, see Emulating namespaces) provide a mechanism for hiding local identifiers. They provide a means of grouping logically related identifiers into corresponding namespaces, thereby making the system more modular.

Data storage devices and many modern programming languages support namespaces. Storage devices use directories (or folders) as namespaces. This allows two files with the same name to be stored on the device so long as they are stored in different directories. In some programming languages (e.g. C++, Python), the identifiers naming namespaces are themselves associated with an enclosing namespace. Thus, in these languages namespaces can nest, forming a namespace tree. At the root of this tree is the unnamed global namespace.

====Use in common languages====
=====C=====
It is possible to use anonymous structs as namespaces in C since C99.

// helper.c
static int _add(int a, int b) {
 return a + b;

const struct {
 double pi;
 int (*add) (int, int);
} helper = { 3.14, _add };

// helper.h
const struct {
 double pi;
 int (*add) (int, int);
} helper;

// main.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &quot;helper.h&quot;

int main(){
 printf(&quot;3 + 2 = %d\n&quot;, helper.add(3, 2));
 printf(&quot;pi is %f\n&quot;, helper.pi);


=====C++=====
In C++, a namespace is defined with a namespace block.

namespace abc {
 int bar;

Within this block, identifiers can be used exactly as they are declared. Outside of this block, the namespace specifier must be prefixed. For example, outside of codice_1, codice_2 must be written codice_3 to be accessed. C++ includes another construct that makes this verbosity unnecessary. By adding the line

using namespace abc;

to a piece of code, the prefix codice_4 is no longer needed.

Identifiers that are not explicitly declared within a namespace are considered to be in the global namespace.

int foo;

These identifiers can be used exactly as they are declared, or, since the global namespace is unnamed, the namespace specifier codice_5 can be prefixed. For example, codice_6 can also be written codice_7.

Namespace resolution in C++ is hierarchical. This means that within the hypothetical namespace codice_8, the identifier codice_9 refers to codice_10. If codice_10 doesn&#x27;t exist, it then refers to codice_12. If neither codice_10 nor codice_12 exist, codice_9 refers to codice_16, an identifier in the global namespace.

Namespaces in C++ are most often used to avoid naming collisions. Although namespaces are used extensively in recent C++ code, most older code does not use this facility because it did not exist in early versions of the language. For example, the entire C++ Standard Library is defined within codice_17, but before standardization many components were originally in the global namespace. A programmer can insert the codice_18 directive to bypass namespace resolution requirements and obtain backwards compatibility with older code that expects all identifiers to be in the global namespace. However the use of the codice_18 directive for reasons other than backwards compatibility (e.g., convenience) is considered to be against good code practices.

=====Java=====
In Java, the idea of a namespace is embodied in Java packages. All code belongs to a package, although that package need not be explicitly named. Code from other packages is accessed by prefixing the package name before the appropriate identifier, for example codice_20 in codice_21 can be referred to as codice_22 (this is known as the fully qualified class name). Like C++, Java offers a construct that makes it unnecessary to type the package name (codice_23). However, certain features (such as reflection) require the programmer to use the fully qualified name.

Unlike C++, namespaces in Java are not hierarchical as far as the syntax of the language is concerned. However, packages are named in a hierarchical manner. For example, all packages beginning with codice_24 are a part of the Java platform—the package contains classes core to the language, and contains core classes specifically relating to reflection.

In Java (and Ada, C#, and others), namespaces/packages express semantic categories of code. For example, in C#, codice_25 contains code provided by the system (the .NET Framework). How specific these categories are and how deep the hierarchies go differ from language to language.

Function and class scopes can be viewed as implicit namespaces that are inextricably linked with visibility, accessibility, and object lifetime.

=====C#=====
Namespaces are heavily used in C# language. All .NET Framework classes are organized in namespaces, to be used more clearly and to avoid chaos. Furthermore, custom namespaces are extensively used by programmers, both to organize their work and to avoid naming collisions.
When referencing a class, one should specify either its fully qualified name, which means namespace followed by the class name:

System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
int i = System.Convert.ToInt32(&quot;123&quot;);
or add a using statement. This eliminates the need to mention the complete name of all classes in that namespace.
using System;

Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
int i = Convert.ToInt32(&quot;123&quot;);
In the above examples, System is a namespace, and Console and Convert are classes defined within System.

=====Python=====
In Python, namespaces are defined by the individual modules, and since modules can be contained in hierarchical packages, then namespaces are hierarchical too.
In general when a module is imported then the names defined in the module are defined via that module&#x27;s namespace, and are accessed in from the calling modules by using the fully qualified name.

# assume modulea defines two functions : func1() and func2() and one class : Class1
import Modulea

Modulea.func1()
Modulea.func2()
a = Modulea.Class1()
The codice_26 statement can be used to insert the relevant names directly into the calling module&#x27;s namespace, and those names can be accessed from the calling module without the qualified name:

# assume Modulea defines two functions : func1() and func2() and one class : Class1
from Modulea import func1

func1()
func2() # this will fail as an undefined name, as will the full name Modulea.func2()
a = Class1() # this will fail as an undefined name, as will the full name Modulea.Class1()

Since this directly imports names (without qualification) it can overwrite existing names with no warnings.

A special form of the statement is codice_27 which imports all names defined in the named package directly in the calling module&#x27;s namespace. Use of this form of import, although supported within the language, is generally discouraged as it pollutes the namespace of the calling module and will cause already defined names to be overwritten in the case of name clashes.

Python also supports codice_28 as a way of providing an alias or alternative name for use by the calling module:
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(1000)
===== XML namespace =====
In XML, the XML namespace specification enables the names of elements and attributes in an XML document to be unique, similar to the role of namespaces in programming languages. Using XML namespaces, XML documents may contain element or attribute names from more than one XML vocabulary.

===== PHP =====
Namespaces were introduced into PHP from version 5.3 onwards. Naming collision of classes, functions and variables can be avoided.
In PHP, a namespace is defined with a namespace block.

# File phpstar/foobar.php

namespace phpstar;

class FooBar
 public function foo(): void
 echo &#x27;Hello world, from function foo&#x27;;

 public function bar(): void
 echo &#x27;Hello world, from function bar&#x27;;
}

We can reference a PHP namespace with the following different ways:

# File index.php

# Include the file
include &quot;phpstar/foobar.php&quot;;

# Option 1: directly prefix the class name with the namespace
$obj_foobar = new \phpstar\FooBar();

# Option 2: import the namespace
use phpstar\FooBar;
$obj_foobar = new FooBar();

# Option 2a: import &amp; alias the namespace
use phpstar\FooBar as FB;
$obj_foobar = new FB();

# Access the properties and methods with regular way
$obj_foobar-&gt;foo();
$obj_foobar-&gt;bar();


===Emulating namespaces===
In programming languages lacking language support for namespaces, namespaces can be emulated to some extent by using an identifier naming convention. For example, C libraries such as libpng often use a fixed prefix for all functions and variables that are part of their exposed interface. Libpng exposes identifiers such as:

 png_create_write_struct
 png_get_signature
 png_read_row
 png_set_invalid

This naming convention provides reasonable assurance that the identifiers are unique and can therefore be used in larger programs without naming collisions. Likewise, many packages originally written in Fortran (e.g., BLAS, LAPACK) reserve the first few letters of a function&#x27;s name to indicate the group to which the function belongs.

This technique has several drawbacks:
* It doesn&#x27;t scale well to nested namespaces; identifiers become excessively long since all uses of the identifiers must be fully namespace-qualified;
* Individuals or organizations may use inconsistent naming conventions, potentially introducing unwanted obfuscation;
* Compound or &quot;query-based&quot; operations on groups of identifiers, based on the namespaces in which they are declared, are rendered unwieldy or unfeasible;
* In languages with restricted identifier length, the use of prefixes limits the number of characters that can be used to identify what the function does; this is a particular problem for packages originally written in FORTRAN 77, which offered only 6 characters per identifier; for example, the name of the BLAS function codice_29 indicates that it operates on double-precision floating-point numbers (codice_30) and general matrices (codice_31), with only the last two characters (codice_32) showing what it actually does: matrix–matrix multiplication.

It also has a few advantages:
* No special software tools are required to locate names in source-code files; a simple program like grep suffices;
* There are no namespace-related name conflicts;
* There is no need for name mangling, and thus no potential incompatibility problems.

<text>Nahum ( or ; &quot;Naḥūm&quot;) was a minor prophet whose prophecy is recorded in the &quot;Tanakh&quot;, also called the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament. His book comes in chronological order between Micah and Habakkuk in the Bible. He wrote about the end of the Assyrian Empire, and its capital city, Nineveh, in a vivid poetic style.

==Life==
Little is known about Nahum&#x27;s personal history. His name means &quot;comfort&quot;, and is derived from the same root as the Hebrew verb meaning &quot;to comfort&quot;. He came from the town of Alqosh (Nahum 1:1), which scholars have attempted to identify with several cities, including the modern Alqosh in northern Iraq and Capernaum of northern Galilee. He was a very nationalistic Hebrew, however, and lived amongst the Elkoshites in peace. Nahum, called &quot;the Elkoshite&quot;, is the seventh in order of the minor prophets.

==Works==
Nahum&#x27;s writings could be taken as prophecy or as history. One account suggests that his writings are a prophecy written in about 615 BCE, just before the downfall of Assyria, while another account suggests that he wrote this passage as liturgy just after its downfall in 612 BCE.

The book was introduced in Reformation theologian Calvin&#x27;s Commentary as a complete and finished poem:

There are indications that an acrostic underlies the present text. Thus 1:2 begins with the first letter of the alphabet (א), verse 3b (‘in whirlwind’) with the second letter (ב), verse 4 with the third (ג), and so on until from ten to sixteen of the twenty two letters have appeared. In places the scheme breaks down: in the process of transmission, what was once an alphabetic poem has now been seriously corrupted, rearranged, and supplemented.

Nahum, taking words from Moses himself, has shown in a general way what sort of &quot;Being God is&quot;. Calvin argued that Nahum painted God by which his nature must be seen, and &quot;it is from that most memorable vision, when God appeared to Moses after the breaking of the tablets.&quot;

==Tomb==

The tomb of Nahum is supposedly inside the synagogue at Alqosh, although there are other places outside Iraq which also lay claim to being the original &quot;Elkosh&quot; from which Nahum hailed. Alqosh was emptied of its Jewish population in 1948 when they were expelled after Israel was recognized as a Jewish nation, and the synagogue that houses the tomb is now in a poor structural state, to the extent that the tomb itself is in danger of destruction. The tomb underwent basic repairs in 1796. When all Jews were forced to flee Alqosh in 1948, the iron keys to the tomb were handed to an Assyrian man, Sami Jajouhana. Few Jews visit the historic site, yet Jajouhana continues to keep the promise he made with his Jewish friends, and looks after the tomb.

As of early 2017, the tomb was in significant disrepair and was threatened by the rise of ISIS in Iraq. A team of engineers conducted a survey of the tomb and determined that the tomb was in danger of imminent collapse and might not survive another winter. A team led by the U.S.-based non-profit Alliance for the Restoration of Cultural Heritage (&quot;ARCH&quot;) raised the funds necessary to stabilize the site. After raising the necessary funds, ARCH partnered with the Prague-based GEMA ART International s.r.o., experts in historic preservation and reconstruction to do the immediate stabilization work. Following coordination with local partners, the initial stabilization work was completed in January 2018. The stabilization work is expected to prevent further deterioration of the structure for between two and three years. With the tomb and its surrounding structure stabilized, ARCH is planning on raising the funding necessary to fully restore the site. On 26 April 2019, the United States government announced that it would contribute $500,000 to restore the tomb.

Two other possible burial sites mentioned in historical accounts are Elkesi, near Rameh in the Galilee and Elcesei in the West Bank.

==Liturgical commemoration==
The prophet Nahum is venerated as a saint in Eastern Christianity. On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, his feast day is December 1 (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, December 1 currently falls on December 14 of the modern Gregorian Calendar). He is commemorated with the other minor prophets in the calendar of saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 31.

<text>Newfoundland English refers to several accents and dialects of Atlantic Canadian English found in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Most of these differ significantly from the English commonly spoken elsewhere in Canada and North America, reflecting the province&#x27;s history and geography. Newfoundland was one of the first areas settled by England in North America, beginning in small numbers in the early 17th century and peaking in the early 19th century. After the 1783 independence of the colonies that formed the United States of America, Newfoundland remained part of British North America, becoming a Dominion within the British Empire in 1907. It joined Canada in 1949 as the last province to join the confederation. 

The dialects of Newfoundland English developed in relative isolation due to the province’s geography. Newfoundland is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, separated from Labrador by the Strait of Belle Isle. This isolation allowed the dialects to develop independently of those on the North American mainland. Historically, Newfoundland English was first recognized as a distinct dialect in the late 18th century when George Cartwright published a glossary of Newfoundland words. Today, some words from Newfoundland English, such as &quot;b&#x27;y&quot; (a form of address), have gained recognition through popular culture in other parts of Canada, particularly in Ontario and eastward. 

Newfoundland English shares some linguistic features with Bermudian English, likely due to historical connections between the two regions. Both were part of the See of Nova Scotia until 1839, after which they became part of the Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda. The shared ecclesiastical and cultural ties, along with movement between the regions, may have contributed to similarities such as the use of &quot;b&#x27;y&quot; in Newfoundland and &quot;bye&quot; in Bermuda. 

Newfoundland English is often referred to as &quot;Newfinese&quot; (also spelled &quot;Newfunese&quot;). The term &quot;Newfie&quot; is also used but is often considered pejorative.

== Influences ==
Much of Newfoundland’s English has been influenced by the languages and dialects of European settlers of the past, such as those who were British, Irish, or French. Also, Indigenous languages prevailed on the island, with some of their influence remains today.

=== British ===
While there was an early dominance of merchants and migrants from Devon, they accounted for only around 30 percent of the English population in places like St. John&#x27;s and Conception Bay in Newfoundland. Most of the coast, except the Avalon Peninsula, was settled by migrants from Dorset, Somerset, and Hampshire, which Handcock refers to as &quot;Wessex.&quot;

A major reason for the migration pattern is that Poole, Dorset became a major port for the Newfoundland fish trade in the mid-1700s, which resulted in settlements that were densely clustered and mainly derived from Devon, Dorset, Somerset, and Hampshire, as these were located near major ports in the West Country of England. That group of migrants accounts for almost 80 percent of all English settlers on Newfoundland.

Ultimately, that has allowed for the preservation of speech patterns derived from the West Country in Newfoundland English. Paddock illustrates how the speech pattern survived in 72 coastal communities in Newfoundland. Specifically, the use of &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;velar&quot; allophone in the communities are phonological features of the West Country. There are regional differences in phonological features. Another preserved phonological feature is the Irish-like fronting for all vowels, which is found in communities on the southern shores of the Avalon Peninsula.

Another speech pattern that is adopted is the conservative paradigm for the verbs &quot;have&quot; and &quot;do&quot; found in the West Country. The verbs &quot;have&quot; and &quot;do&quot; are dependent on their function as auxiliaries or lexical verbs. As auxiliaries, the vernacular paradigm remains uninflected: &quot;he haven&#x27;t seen her&quot;. In contrast, when used as lexical verbs, the &quot;-s&quot; inflection appears throughout the paradigm, as in &quot;they haves/has no business being here&quot; or &quot;we doos [du:z]/does that all the time.&quot;

Other forms of preservation are specific terms in vocabulary like &quot;moreish,&quot; meaning a particular food of which one cannot help having more, and are still used in Newfoundland.

Newfoundland was a British colony for nearly two centuries until 1949, when it became a province of Canada. That makes Newfoundland English have features similar to those found in the English of the West Country. They include the use of certain vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. Newfoundland English has also developed its own distinct features over time, particularly by the influence of Irish and French migrants and its isolation from the rest of Canada.

=== Irish ===
Irish involvement in Newfoundland fisheries can be traced back to 1675. Approximately half of the population of most settlements on the shores of the Avalon Peninsula was Irish by 1750. The first significant influx of immigrants occurred mainly during the first thirty years of the 19th century. The number of immigrants on the island had grown to 38,000 by 1836, which constituted half of the total population of Newfoundland.

Approximately 85% of Irish immigrants originated from the counties of Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, Tipperary, and Carlow, in south-eastern Ireland. The remainder came from western counties, like Cork and Kerry.

Irish migrants inhabited relatively limited areas of the province, primarily in the southern parts of the Avalon Peninsula. Irish and English migrants were divided by their different religious affiliations of Catholicism and Protestantism. There was intermingling of local economics, but those interactions were limited. The geography of the island reinforced the religious division resulted in distinctive and resistant dialects of English in Newfoundland and thus preserved the south-eastern speech patterns of Ireland in Newfoundland.

The speech pattern of using the &quot;after&quot; form of the perfect aspect of the verb has been widely adopted in Newfoundland English. That particular construction, as in &quot;look what I&#x27;m after doin&#x27; now!&quot;, has quickly spread throughout the region, despite the existence of several other alternatives such as &quot;I&#x27;ve done,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve adone,&quot; and &quot;I bin done,&quot; which come from the West Country.

Another speech pattern that is preserved is the slit fricative [t] variant, a well-known feature of Irish English. The postvocalic /t/ contexts are prevalent in pre-pause positions except before consonants and are commonly used in Newfoundland&#x27;s Avalon Peninsula. On the other hand, that characteristic is not shared by the Newfoundland settlements from the West Country. In addition, the monophthongal /e/ and postvocalic /l/ pronunciations are inherited from the Irish and are mainly used today by older Irish ethno-religious people.

=== French ===
French settlement influences are prevalent in the Bay d’Espoir and Port au Port Peninsula on the west coast of the island. Newfoundland French was deliberately discouraged by the government of Newfoundland in the public schools during the mid-20th century, and only a small handful of people, who are mainly elderly, still fluently speak the French-Newfoundland dialect. In the last couple of decades, many parents in the region have demanded and obtained Canadian French education for their children, but that would be Standard French education and does not represent a continuation of the old dialect per se.

Also, some people living in the Codroy Valley, on the southwestern tip of Newfoundland, have ancestors who were francophone but represent Acadian settlers from Canada&#x27;s Maritime Provinces. They arrived during the 19th century and have lost the French language as well.

=== Indigenous ===
Most of the Indigenous influence within Newfoundland English has been assimilated and forgotten under colonialism. The Beothuk, the Indigenous people of the island, whose language and people were eradicated in the 19th century, have had bits and pieces of their vocabulary poorly transcribed. None of it is used in today’s vernacular.

A scarce number of Indigenous terms are still used in Newfoundland’s lexis and are influenced by the Innu, Mi’kmaq, and Inuit peoples. For example, the term &quot;tabanask&quot;, a term from the Innu language, refers to a toboggan. Also, the term &quot;babbish&quot; refers to stretched animal hide used in snowshoes. &quot;Sina&quot; refers to the edge of a floating ice field and is from the Inuit language.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
==== Th-stopping ====
The is used to represent the voiced &quot;th&quot; sound , and a to represent the voiceless one . For example, &quot;that thing over there&quot; becomes &quot;dat ting over dere&quot; and is derived from Hiberno-English. The stopping of the interdental /ð/ is present in the speech of those in Petty Harbour, a region south of the capital, St. John’s. Research has shown that men tend to have /ð/ stopping more often than women within this region, but that is not the case with function words like &quot;this, them, that, these.&quot; Middle-aged women were found to start /ð/ stopping when they say function words, which would thus change to &quot;dis, dem, dat, dese.&quot;

====Slit fricative t ====
The phoneme at the end of words or between vowels is pronounced as in Hiberno-English. The most common pronunciation is as a voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative, also known as a &quot;slit fricative.&quot; The phoneme does not have a separate symbol in IPA and can be transcribed as (a retracted voiceless dental fricative). Thus, &quot;hitting&quot; is distinguished from &quot;hissing&quot; only by the fricative in the latter word being pronounced with clenched teeth (see sibilant consonant) and being laminal, rather than the apical sound of the slit fricative in &quot;hitting&quot;. As the &quot;th&quot; sounds are stopped in Newfoundland, there is no confusion between the slit and the sound. As a result, it is very common to hear &quot;thing&quot; being pronounced as &quot;ting,&quot; as is mentioned above. The slit fricative /t/, which replaces the usual Canadian /θ/, acts as a marker of Newfoundlanders&#x27; identity.

==== Voiced fricatives ====
The modification of initial voiceless fricatives to voiced fricatives can be heard by those in the West Country region (the Northeast, South, and West Coasts and Labrador). Voiceless fricatives, such as /f/ and /s/, are often modified to their voiced fricative counterparts, /v/ and /z/ respectively. Terms like &quot;salt&quot; and &quot;fir&quot; thus change to &quot;zalt&quot; and &quot;vir&quot; as a result of that shift. Those speech patterns are less prominent today but survive in pockets in the West Country regions.

==== Simplified consonant clusters ====
The West Country is known to remove the last consonant of clusters in their speech. Terms like &quot;loft&quot;, &quot;bald&quot;, and &quot;almost&quot; are simplified to like &quot;lof&quot;, &quot;bal,&quot; and &quot;almos&quot;.

==== H-dropping ====
Both h-dropping and h-insertion occur in the West Country, and in many varieties of Newfoundland English. For example, Holyrood becomes Olyrood, and Avondale becomes Havondale.

==== Rhoticity ====
Newfoundland is mainly rhotic, like the rest of North America, and in Ireland and the West Country. Some non-rhoticity is found in some regions.

==== L-darkness ====
Some speakers of Newfoundland English pronounce as unvelarized and so the phrase &quot;sell it later&quot; is pronounced (cf. General American ). That may be from Irish-influenced varieties of English since they have light variants in both coda and onset positions.

==== Pulmonic ingressive ====
Newfoundland English often pronounces the affirmative &quot;yeah&quot; with an inhalation, rather than an exhalation, in the older generations. That is an example of a rare pulmonic ingressive phone.

=== Vowels ===
In much of Newfoundland, the words &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; are homophones. A similar merger is found in the Norfolk dialect of East Anglia, England, and in New Zealand English.

Newfoundland English traditionally lacked Canadian raising, but that has changed to some extent in the generations since Newfoundland&#x27;s 1949 joining Canada. People in the Avalon Peninsula, which underwent Irish settlement, display obvious Canadian raising pattern for /ɑɪ/ but not typically for the /ɑʊ/ diphthong. The latter feature has long existed in Newfoundland English but is not very common except in the rural South Coast community of Newhook. There, it exists in the speech patterns of more women than men.

Many speakers of Newfoundland English have a complete merger of and (a &quot;kit&quot;–&quot;dress&quot; merger), usually realized with (in words like &quot;bit&quot; and &quot;bet&quot;) but with before (in words like &quot;beer&quot; and &quot;bear&quot;). The merger is common in Irish-settled parts of Newfoundland and is thought to be a relic of the former Irish pronunciation.

=== Tempo ===
Speakers of Newfoundland English may seem to speak faster than other Canadian English speakers. The perceived tempo difference may be a coupling of obvious pronunciation differences with Newfoundland&#x27;s unusual sayings and is a contributing factor to the difficulty that outsiders sometimes experience with understanding the dialect.

== Grammar ==
=== &quot;After&quot; past ===
In a move that was almost certainly taken from Hiberno-English and influenced by the Irish language, Newfoundland English avoids using the verb &quot;to have&quot; in past participles and prefers formulations with &quot;after&quot; such as &quot;I&#x27;m after telling him to stop&quot; instead of &quot;I have told him to stop.&quot; That is because Irish has no verb &quot;to have&quot; but more particularly has a construction using the words &quot;Tar éis&quot; (meaning &quot;after&quot;) to convey the sense of having just done something: &quot;Táim tar éis é a dhéanamh&quot; means &quot;I am just after doing it&quot; or &quot;I have just done it.&quot; Possession in Irish would be indicated by &quot;Ta ... agam&quot;, literally &quot;... is at me.&quot;

=== Northern Subject Rule ===
Newfoundland English often follows the Northern Subject Rule, a legacy of settlement from southeastern Ireland, which in turn was influenced by the Anglo-Irish settlement from Northern England into Ireland. For example, the verb &quot;to fly&quot; is conjugated for third-person plural as &quot;the birds flies.&quot; According to a 2011 study by Philip Comeau, that feature of Newfoundland English differs from the rule of dialects in Northern England because Newfoundland uses it as a marker of habitual aspect or verb stativity.

=== Archaic pronouns ===

&quot;Ye&quot; is the plural form of &quot;you&quot; (singular) instead of &quot;you&quot; (plural), similar to how &quot;you guys&quot; is often used to replace &quot;you&quot; (plural) in Standard Canadian English. For example, when addressing two or more people, or when addressing one person but referring to everyone accompanying a person is, Newfoundland English uses &quot;What do ye think?&quot; instead of &quot;What do you guys think?&quot; Alternately, &quot;What do you think?&quot; is used to refer to a single person. That avoids the confusion of other English dialects in which a group of people would not know whether the speaker is inquiring about only the opinion of the person who is being speaking or the various opinions of the entire group. In most areas of Newfoundland that use the pronoun, such as the Avalon Peninsula outside St. John&#x27;s, &quot;ye&quot; mirrors the same variant in Hiberno-English in which &quot;you&quot; (singular), &quot;you&quot; (plural), and &quot;they&quot; correspond to &quot;you,&quot; &quot;ye,&quot; and &quot;dey.&quot; The last arises simply from a change in pronunciation and so it is written &quot;they,&quot; but the other words are pronounced as in Standard English. Variants of &quot;ye&quot; are also used such as &quot;yeer&quot; (your), &quot;yeers&quot; (yours), and &quot;yeerselves&quot; (yourselves). In some communities on the Northeast Coast, &quot;you&quot; (singular), &quot;you&quot; (plural), and &quot;they&quot; correspond to &quot;ye,&quot; &quot;dee,&quot; and &quot;dey,&quot; respectively.

=== Habitual aspect using &quot;be&quot; ===
The word &quot;bes&quot; is sometimes used in place of the normally-conjugated forms of &quot;to be&quot; to describe continual actions or states of being, as in &quot;that rock usually bes under water&quot; for &quot;that rock is usually under water,&quot; but the normal conjugation of &quot;to be&quot; is used in all other cases.

&quot;Does be&quot; is a calque of Irish grammar into English. Since there is no habitual aspect in English, Irish speakers learning English would say &quot;does be&quot; as a literal translation of &quot;bíonn mé&quot; &quot;I (habitually) am&quot;.

=== &quot;Me&quot; for &quot;my&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; ===
Use or ownership in Newfoundland English is characterized by pronouncing &quot;my&quot; as &quot;me,&quot; which is common also in Ireland, Scotland, Northern and Western England, and some dialects in Australia. Before the Great Vowel Shift, &quot;my&quot; was pronounced , &quot;mine&quot; as , and &quot;me&quot; as . As with all other sound shifts, not all possible words have been changed in the other dialects that were noted. An example in Newfoundland is &quot;Where&#x27;s me hat?&quot; for &quot;Where&#x27;s my hat?&quot;

=== Use of &quot;to&quot; for location ===
The use of &quot;to&quot; to denote location is common in Newfoundland English by using &quot;where&#x27;s that to?&quot; Replacing the standard &quot;where&#x27;s that?&quot; is a usage comes from the West Country and is still common in southwestern England, particularly in Bristol.

== Expressions ==
Archaic adverbial intensifiers are preserved in Newfoundland such as &quot;that play was right boring&quot; and &quot;that play was some boring&quot; for &quot;that play was very boring&quot;. They have been retained also in Northern England such as in the Yorkshire dialect and in Geordie and are sometimes heard in the Maritime Provinces of Canada.

Newfoundland English is not homogeneous and varies markedly from community to community and from region to region, which reflects both ethnic origin and relative isolation. For many decades, Newfoundland had very few roads connecting its many communities. Fishing villages, in particular, remained very isolated.

In Newfoundland English, it is typical for a response to a metaphorical question like &quot;How&#x27;s she cuttin&#x27;?&quot; with a dry literal response. A proper response to the foresaid question would be &quot;Like a knife.&quot; Or perhaps &quot;How ya gettin&#x27; on?&quot; To which the response might be &quot;Same way I gets off!&quot; The question/greeting is a phrase still current in the Irish Midlands and North but is rarely, if ever, responded to with such a literal answer there.

In recent years, the most commonly-noted Newfoundland English expression might be &quot;Whadd&#x27;ya at?&quot; (&quot;What are you at?&quot;), loosely translated to &quot;How&#x27;s it going?&quot; or &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Coming in a close second might be &quot;You&#x27;re stunned as me arse, b&#x27;y;&quot; it implies incredible stupidity or foolishness in the person being spoken to.

Other local expressions include:
* &quot;Eh, b&#x27;y&quot; (also spelled &#x27;Aye b&#x27;y&#x27; and &#x27;ay b&#x27;y&#x27;, and sometimes said as &#x27;yes b&#x27;y): shortened form of &quot;yes, boy.&quot; It&#x27;s a term used to agree with what someone is saying. Can be used sarcastically. 
* &quot;Yes, b&#x27;y&quot;: Yes boy. It is an expression of awe or disbelief. Also commonly used sarcastically to mean yeah right. It is similar to &quot;eh, b&#x27;y.&quot;
* &quot;Where ya at?&quot;: Where are you?
* &quot;Stay where you&#x27;re to/at till I comes where ya&#x27;re at/to.&quot;: Wait there for me
* &quot;Get on the go&quot;: Let&#x27;s go. It is also a common euphemism for partying. &quot;on the go&quot; by itself can also refer to a relationship – similar to a dating stage, but more hazy. The term also refers to drinking (&quot;gettin on the go tonight&quot; – going out drinking tonight)
* &quot;Havin&#x27; a time&quot;: having fun 
* &quot;You knows yourself&quot;: Responding to statement in agreement.
* &quot;What are ye at?&quot;, or &quot;Wadda ya&#x27;at b&#x27;y?&quot;: How are you doing, or sometimes What are you doing?

* &quot;Hows you gettin&#x27; on, cocky?&quot;: &quot;How are you today?&quot;
* &quot;You&#x27;re a nice kind young feller&quot;: &quot;You are a nice young boy&quot;

* &quot;Me ol&#x27; cock&quot;: another term of endearment like &quot;my friend,&quot; &quot;me son,&quot; or &quot;my bud.&quot;
* &quot;You&#x27;re some crooked&quot;: You are grouchy
* &quot;He[she/dey] just took off&quot;:, They left recently/quickly. Whether or not it denotes time depends on use of the word &quot;just;&quot; by not including &quot;just&quot; denotes speed, whereas using &quot;just&quot; denotes time.

* &quot;My treasure&quot;: female friend or relative. These three terms are used platonically.
* &quot;Rimmed/Warped&quot;: to be deformed or distorted in an unusable fashion. Often used to describe someone who is seen upon as weird or an outcast (i.e., She&#x27;s rimmed, b&#x27;y).

* &quot;Scrob/Scrawb&quot;: a scratch on one&#x27;s skin, likely from the Irish &quot;scríob&quot; (i.e.: &quot;The cat gave me some scrob, b&#x27;y&quot; falling into disuse in lieu of &quot;scratch&quot;)
* &quot;Gets on/Getting on&quot;, used to refer to how a person or group behaves (i.e. &quot;You knows how da b&#x27;ys gets on&quot; / &quot;How&#x27;s she getting on?&quot;)
* &quot;On the go&quot;, To have something processing (&quot;I&#x27;ve got an application on the go&quot;) or be in a relationship (&quot;He&#x27;s got some missus on the go&quot;)
* &quot;Can&#x27;t do &#x27;ar ting when ya got nar ting ta do &#x27;ar ting wit.&quot; – &quot;You can&#x27;t do anything when you have nothing to do anything with.&quot; [&#x27;ar – any, opposite of nar (from &quot;nary,&quot; as in &quot;nary a one&quot; – not a one)]
(Some examples taken from &quot;A Biography of the English Language&quot; by C.M. Millward)

Also of note is the widespread use of the term &quot;b&#x27;y&quot; as a common form of address. It is shorthand for &quot;boy&quot;, (and is a turn of phrase particularly pronounced with the Waterford dialect of Hiberno-Irish) but is used variably to address members of either sex. Another term of endearment, often spoken by older generations, is &quot;me ducky&quot;, used when addressing a female in an informal manner, and usually placed at the end of a sentence which is often a question (Example: &quot;How&#x27;s she goin&#x27;, me ducky?&quot;) – a phrase also found in East Midlands British English. Also pervasive as a sentence ending is &quot;right&quot; used in the same manner as the Canadian &quot;eh&quot; or the American &quot;huh&quot; or &quot;y&#x27;know&quot;. Even if the sentence would otherwise be a non-question, the pronunciation of &quot;right&quot; can sometimes make it seem like affirmation is being requested.

Certain words have also gained prominence amongst the speakers of Newfoundland English. For instance, a large body of water that may be referred to as a &quot;lake&quot; elsewhere may often (but not uniformly) be referred to as a &quot;pond.&quot; In addition, a large landmass that rises high out of the ground, regardless of elevation, is referred to unwaveringly as a &quot;hill,&quot; but there is a difference between a hill and a big hill.

Another major characteristic of some variants of Newfoundland English is adding the letter &#x27;h&#x27; to words that begin with vowel sounds or removing &#x27;h&#x27; from words that begin with it. In some districts, the term house commonly is referred to as the &quot;ouse,&quot; for example, and &quot;even&quot; might be said &quot;h&#x27;even.&quot; The idiom &quot;&#x27;E drops &#x27;is h in &#x27;Olyrood and picks en up in H&#x27;Avondal.&quot; is often used to describe that by using the neighbouring eastern towns Holyrood and Avondale as examples. There are many different variations of the Newfoundland dialect depending on geographical location within the province. It is also important to note that Labrador has a very distinct culture and dialect within its region.

== Other ==
Although it is referred to as &quot;Newfoundland English&quot; or &quot;Newfinese&quot;, the island of Newfoundland is not the only place which uses the dialect. Some southerly areas of Labrador and an area near the Labrador border, the mostly English-speaking Basse-Côte-Nord of Quebec, also use it. Younger generations of the area have adapted the way of speaking, and created some of their own expressions. Some older generations speak Newfoundland English, but it is more commonly used by the younger generations. &quot;B&#x27;y&quot; is one of the most common terms used in the area.

It is also common to hear Newfoundland English in Yellowknife; Southern Alberta; and Fort McMurray, Alberta, where many Newfoundlanders have moved or commute regularly for employment. Newfoundland English is also used frequently in the city of Cambridge, Ontario because of the high population of Newfoundlanders there, most of whom are from Bell Island.

<text>A national flag is a flag that represents and symbolizes a given nation. It is flown by the government of that nation, but can also be flown by its citizens. A national flag is typically designed with specific meanings for its colours and symbols, which may also be used separately from the flag as a symbol of the nation. The design of a national flag is sometimes altered after the occurrence of important historical events.

==History==
Historically, flags originated as military standards, used as field signs. Throughout history, various examples of such proto-flags exist: the white cloth banners of the Zhou dynasty&#x27;s armies in the 11th century BC, the &quot;vexillum&quot; standards flown by the armies of the Roman Empire, the Black Standard famously carried by Muhammad which later became the flag of the Abbasid Caliphate, and the various &quot;Raven banners&quot; flown by Viking chieftains. Angelino Dulcert published a series of comprehensive Portolan charts in the 14th century AD, which famously showcased the flags of several polities depicted – although these are not uniformly &quot;national flags&quot;, as some were likely the personal standards of the respective nation&#x27;s rulers.

The practice of flying flags indicating the country of origin &quot;outside&quot; of the context of warfare became common with the maritime flag. During the 13th century, the republics of Genoa and Venice both used maritime flags; William Gordon Perrin wrote that the republic of Genoa was &quot;one of the earliest states to adopt a national flag&quot;.

The current design of the flag of the Netherlands originates as a variant of the late 16th century orange-white-blue &quot;Prinsenvlag&quot; (&quot;Prince&#x27;s Flag&quot;), that was used in the Dutch War of Independence (1568–1648), evolving in the early 17th century as the red-white-blue &quot;Statenvlag&quot; (&quot;States Flag&quot;), the naval flag of the States-General of the Dutch Republic, making the Dutch flag perhaps the oldest tricolour flag in continuous use, although standardisation of the exact colours is of a much later date.

During the Age of Sail in the early 17th century, the Union Jack finds its origins, when James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones (as James I). On 12 April 1606, the new flag representing this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the flag of England (a red cross on a white background, known as St George&#x27;s Cross), and the flag of Scotland (a white saltire on a blue background, known as the Saltire or St Andrew&#x27;s Cross), would be joined, forming the flag of Great Britain and first Union Flag - but then without the red Cross of St. Patrick. It continued in use until 1 January 1801, the effective date of the legislative union of Great Britain and Ireland, when the Cross of St. Patrick (a red diagonal cross on white) was incorporated into the flag, giving the Union Jack its current design.

With the emergence of nationalist sentiment from the late 18th century national flags began to be displayed in civilian contexts as well. Notable early examples include the US flag, which was first adopted as a naval ensign in 1777 but began to be displayed as a generic symbol of the United States after the American Revolution, and the French Tricolor, which became a symbol of the Republic in the 1790s.

Most countries of Europe standardised and codified the designs of their maritime flags as national flags, in the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The specifications of the flag of Denmark, based on a flag that was in continuous use since the 14th-century, were codified in 1748, as a rectangular flag with certain proportions, replacing the variant with a split. The flag of Switzerland was introduced in 1889, also based on medieval war flags.
In Europe, the red-white-blue tricolour design of the flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands became popular, since it was associated with a republican form of government through that country&#x27;s long war of independence against the Spanish Crown. That association was greatly reinforced after the French Revolution (1789), when France used the same colours, but with vertical instead of horizontal stripes. Other countries in Europe (like Ireland, Italy, Romania and Estonia) and in South and Central America selected tricolours of their own to express their adherence to the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity as embodied in the French flag.
The Ottoman flag (now the flag of Turkey) was adopted in 1844. Other non-European powers followed the trend in the late 19th century, the flag of Great Qing being introduced in 1862, that of Japan being introduced in 1870. 
Also in the 19th century, most countries of South America introduced a flag as they became independent (Peru in 1820, Bolivia in 1851, Colombia in 1860, Brazil in 1822, etc.)

Currently, there are 193 national flags in the world flown by sovereign states that are members of the United Nations.

==Process of adoption==

The national flag is often mentioned or described in a country&#x27;s constitution, but its detailed description may be delegated to a flag law passed by the legislature, or even secondary legislation or in monarchies a decree.

Thus, the national flag is mentioned briefly in the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany of 1949 &quot;the federal flag is black-red-gold&quot; (art. 22.2 &quot;Die Bundesflagge ist schwarz-rot-gold&quot;), but its proportions were regulated in a document passed by the government in the following year. The Flag of the United States is not defined in the constitution but rather in a separate Flag Resolution passed in 1777.

Minor design changes of national flags are often passed on a legislative or executive level, while substantial changes have constitutional character. The design of the flag of Serbia omitting the communist star of the flag of Yugoslavia was a decision made in the 1992 Serbian constitutional referendum, but the adoption of a coat of arms within the flag was based on a government &quot;recommendation&quot; in 2003, adopted legislatively in 2009 and again subject to a minor design change in 2010. The flag of the United States underwent numerous changes because the number of stars represents the number of states, proactively defined in a Flag Act of 1818 to the effect that &quot;on the admission of every new state into the Union, one star be added to the union of the flag&quot;; it was changed most recently in 1960 with the accession of Hawaii.
On 17 March 1861, there was the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, a formal act that sanctioned, with a normative act of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the birth of the unified Kingdom of Italy. On 15 April 1861, the flag of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, in the form of a green, white and red tricolour, was declared the flag of the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. The tricolour therefore continued to be the national flag also of the new State, although not officially recognised by a specific law, but regulated with regard to the shape of military banners. With the royal decree nº 2072 of 24 September 1923 and subsequently with the law nº2264 of 24 December 1925, the Italian tricolour officially became the national flag of the Kingdom of Italy. On 13 June 1946, the Italian Republic was officially founded and the last king of Italy Umberto II, who succeeded his father Victor Emmanuel III on 9 May 1946, left the country on 13 June into exile. On the same day, the tricolour with the Savoy coat of arms in the centre was lowered from the Quirinal Palace. The Italian flag was modified with the decree of the president of the Council of Ministers No. 1 of 19 June 1946. Compared to the monarchic banner, the Savoy coat of arms was eliminated. This decision was later confirmed in the session of 24 March 1947 by the Constituent Assembly, which decreed the insertion of article 12 of the Italian Constitution, subsequently ratified by the Italian Parliament.

A change in national flag is often due to a change of regime, especially following a civil war or revolution. In such cases, the military origins of the national flag and its connection to political ideology (form of government, monarchy vs. republic vs. theocracy, etc.) remains visible. In such cases national flags acquire the status of a political symbol.

The flag of Germany, for instance, was a tricolour of black-white-red under the German Empire, inherited from the North German Confederation (1866). The Weimar Republic that followed adopted a black-red-gold tricolour. Nazi Germany went back to black-white-red in 1933, and black-red-gold was reinstituted by the two successor states, West Germany and East Germany, with East Germany&#x27;s flag being defaced with Communist symbols, following World War II. Similarly the flag of Libya introduced with the creation of the Kingdom of Libya in 1951 was abandoned in 1969 with the coup d&#x27;état led by Muammar Gaddafi. It was used again by National Transitional Council and by anti-Gaddafi forces during the Libyan Civil War in 2011 and officially adopted by the Libyan interim Constitutional Declaration.

==Usage==
There are three distinct types of national flag for use on land, and three for use at sea, though many countries use identical designs for several (and sometimes all) of these types of flag.

===On land===
On land, there is a distinction between civil flags (FIAV symbol ), state flags (), and war or military flags (). Civil flags may be flown by anyone regardless of whether they are linked to government, whereas state flags are those used officially by government agencies. War flags (also called military flags) are used by military organizations such as Armies, Marine Corps, or Air Forces.

In practice, many countries (such as the United States and the United Kingdom) have identical flags for these three purposes; national flag is sometimes used as a vexillological term to refer to such a three-purpose flag (). In a number of countries, however, and notably those in Latin America, there is a distinct difference between civil and state flags. In most cases, the civil flag is a simplified version of the state flag, with the difference often being the presence of a coat of arms on the state flag that is absent from the civil flag.

Very few countries use a war flag that differs from the state flag. Taiwan, Japan, and China are notable examples of this. Swallow-tailed flags are used as war flags and naval ensigns in Nordic countries and charged versions as presidential or royal standards. The Philippines does not have a distinctive war flag in this usual sense, but the flag of the Philippines is legally unique in that it is flown with the red stripe on top when the country is in a state of war, rather than the conventional blue.
===At sea===
The flag that indicates nationality on a ship is called an ensign. As with the national flags, there are three varieties: the civil ensign (), flown by private vessels; state ensigns (also called government ensigns; ), flown by government ships; and war ensigns (also called naval ensigns; ), flown by naval vessels. The ensign is flown from an ensign-staff at the stern of the ship, or from a gaff when underway. Both these positions are superior to any other on the ship, even though the masthead is higher. In the absence of a gaff the ensign may be flown from the yardarm. (See Maritime flags.) National flags may also be flown by aircraft and the land vehicles of important officials. In the case of aircraft, those flags are usually painted on, and those are usually to be painted on in the position as if they were blowing in the wind.

In some countries, such as the United States and Canada (except for the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s Ensign), the national ensign is identical to the national flag, while in others, such as the United Kingdom, India, Italy and Japan, there are specific ensigns for maritime use. Most countries do not have a separate state ensign, although the United Kingdom is a rare exception, in having a red ensign for civil use, a white ensign as its naval ensign, and a blue ensign for government non-military vessels. Italian naval ensign bears the arms of the Italian Navy: a shield, surmounted by a turreted and rostrum crown, which brings together in four parts the arms of four ancient maritime republics (Republic of Venice, Republic of Genoa, Republic of Pisa and Republic of Amalfi).

===Protocol===
There is a great deal of protocol involved in the proper display of national flags. A general rule is that the national flag should be flown in the position of honour, and not in an inferior position to any other flag (although some countries make an exception for royal standards). The following rules are typical of the conventions when flags are flown on land:
*When a national flag is displayed together with any other flags, it must be hoisted first and lowered last.
*When a national flag is displayed together with the national flags of other countries, all the flags should be of approximately equal size and must be flown at an equal height, although the national flag of the host country should be flown in the position of honour (in the centre of an odd number of flagpoles or at the far right — left from an observer&#x27;s point of view — of an even number of flagpoles).
*The flags of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Lebanon are wrapped (from left to right - from right to left from the side an observer&#x27;s point of view), as some of these flags carry Arabic texts.
*When a national flag is displayed together with flags other than national flags, it should be flown on a separate flagpole, either higher or in the position of honour.
*When a national flag is displayed together with any other flags on the same flagpole, it must be at the top, though separate flagpoles are preferable.
*When a national flag is displayed together with any other flag on crossed flagpoles, the national flag must be on the observer&#x27;s left and its flagpole must be in front of the flagpole of the other flag.
*When a national flag is displayed together with another flag or flags in procession, the national flag must be on the marching right. If there is a row of flags, it should be in the position of honour.
*When a national flag, with some exceptions, is flown upside down it indicates distress. This however is merely tradition. It is not a recognised distress signal according to the International regulations for preventing collisions at sea. Further, a nation&#x27;s flag is commonly flown inverted as a sign of protest or contempt against the country concerned. As of now, only the flag of the Philippines recognises the distress symbolism of the reverse flag.

===Hanging a flag vertically===
Most flags are hung vertically by rotating the flag pole. However, some countries have specific protocols for this purpose or even have special flags for vertical hanging; usually rotating some elements of the flag — such as the coat of arms — so that they are seen in an upright position.

Examples of countries that have special protocol for vertical hanging are: Canada, Czech Republic, Greece, Israel, the Philippines, South Africa, and the United States (reverse always showing); and the United Kingdom (obverse always showing).

Examples of countries that have special designs for vertical hanging are: Austria, Cambodia (coat of arms must be rotated 90° and blue strips are narrowed), Dominica (coat of arms must be rotated and reverse always showing), Germany, Hungary, Liechtenstein (crown must be rotated 90°), Mexico, Montenegro (coat of arms must be rotated 90° to normal position), Nepal, Slovakia (coat of arms must be rotated 90° to normal position), and Saudi Arabia (shahada must be rotated 90°). A vertical banner is used instead of the horizontal flag for Malaysia.


==Design==

The art and practice of designing flags is known as vexillography. The design of national flags has seen a number of customs become apparent.

Most national flags are rectangular, or have a rectangular common variant, with the most notable exception being the flag of Nepal. The ratios of height to width vary among national flags, but none is taller than it is wide, again except for the flag of Nepal. The flags of Switzerland and the Vatican City are the only national flags which are exact squares.

The obverse and reverse of all national flags are either identical or mirrored, except for the flag of Paraguay and the partially recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. See Flags whose reverse differs from the obverse for a list of exceptions including non-national flags.

As of 2011 all national flags consist of at least two different colours. In many cases, the different colours are presented in either horizontal or vertical bands. It is particularly common for colours to be presented in bands of three.

It is common for many flags to feature national symbols, such as coats of arms. National patterns are present in some flags. Variations in design within a national flag can be common in the flag&#x27;s upper left quarter, or canton. A third of the world&#x27;s 196 countries currently have national flags that include religious symbols. This has led to controversy in some secular states in regard to the separation of church and state, when the national symbol is officially sanctioned by a government.

===Colours===


The most common colours in national flags are red, white, green, dark blue, yellow, light blue, and black. The only national flag not to include the colors red, white, or blue is Jamaica&#x27;s. The occurrence of each colour in all the flags is listed in detail in the table below. The table shows that the colours light brown, dark brown and grey are only present in very small quantities. To be more precise these colours are currently only present in some of the symbols found within a few flags, such as in the case of the Spanish flag.

===Similarities===

Although the national flag is meant to be a unique symbol representing a nation, many countries have highly similar flags. Examples include the flags of Monaco and Indonesia, which differ only slightly in proportion and the tint of red; the flags of the Netherlands and Luxembourg, which differ in proportion as well as in the tint of blue used; the flags of Romania and Chad, which differ only in the tint of blue, and the flags of Cuba and Puerto Rico, which differ only in proportion, placement and tint of colors.

The flags of Ireland and Ivory Coast and the flags of Mali and Guinea are (aside from shade or ratio differences) vertically mirrored versions from each other. This means that the reverse of one flag matches the obverse of the other. Unlike horizontally mirrored flags (like Poland and Indonesia) the direction in which these flags fly is crucial to identify them.

There are three colour combinations that are used on several flags in certain regions. Blue, white, and red is a common combination in Slavic countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Croatia as well as among Western nations including Australia, France, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Many African nations use the Pan-African colours of red, yellow, and green, including Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali and Senegal. Flags containing red, white, and black (a subset of the Pan-Arab colours) can be found particularly among the Arab nations such as Egypt, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
Due to the common arrangement of the same colours, at first sight, it seems that the only difference between the Italian and the Mexican flag is only the coat of arms of Mexico present in the latter; in reality the Italian tricolour uses lighter shades of green and red, and has different proportions than the Mexican flag—those of the Italian flag are equal to 2:3, while the proportions of the Mexican flag are 4:7. The similarity between the two flags posed a serious problem in maritime transport, given that originally the Mexican mercantile flag was devoid of arms and therefore was consequently identical to the Italian Republican tricolour of 1946; to obviate the inconvenience, at the request of the International Maritime Organization, both Italy and Mexico adopted naval flags with different crests.

Many other similarities may be found among current national flags, particularly if inversions of colour schemes are considered, e.g., compare the flag of Senegal to that of Cameroon and Indonesia to Poland and Monaco. Also the flag of Italy and the flag of Hungary use the same colours, although the order and direction differ (the Italian flag is vertical green-white-red and the Hungarian flag is horizontal red-white-green). The same goes for the flag of France and the flag of the Netherlands (the French flag is vertical blue-white-red and the Dutch flag is horizontal red-white-blue). 

==== Flag families ====

While some similarities are coincidental, others are part of a flag family, flags rooted in shared histories. For example, the flags of Colombia, of Ecuador, and of Venezuela all use variants of the flag of Gran Colombia, the country they composed upon their independence from Spain, created by the Venezuelan independence hero Francisco de Miranda; and the flags of Kuwait, of Jordan, and of Palestine are all highly similar variants of the flag of the Arab revolt of 1916–1918. The flags of Romania and Moldova are virtually the same, because of the common history and heritage. Moldova adopted the Romanian flag during the declaration of independence from the USSR in 1991 (and was used in various demonstrations and revolts by the population) and later the Moldovan coat of arms (which is part of the Romanian coat of arms) was placed in the centre of the flag. All Nordic countries, with the exception of Greenland, use the Nordic Cross design (Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, in addition to the autonomous regions of the Faroe Islands and Åland), a horizontal cross shifted to the left on a single-coloured background. The United States and United Kingdom both have red, white, and blue. This similarity is due to the fact that the first 13 states of the U.S. were formerly colonies of the United Kingdom. Some similarities to the United States flag with the red and white stripes are noted as well such as the flag of Malaysia and the flag of Liberia, the latter of which was an American resettlement colony. Also, several former colonies of the United Kingdom, such as Australia, Fiji and New Zealand include the Union Jack in the top left corner.

<text>The National Hockey League (NHL; , LNH) is a professional ice hockey league in North America composed of 32 teams25 in the United States and 7 in Canada. The NHL is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and is considered the premier professional ice hockey league in the world. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) views the Stanley Cup as one of the &quot;most important championships available to the sport&quot;. The NHL is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.

The National Hockey League was organized at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal on November 26, 1917, after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization, the National Hockey Association (NHA), which had been founded in 1909 at Renfrew, Ontario. The NHL immediately took the NHA&#x27;s place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926.

At its inception, the NHL had four teams, all in Canada, thus the adjective &quot;National&quot; in the league&#x27;s name. The league expanded to the United States in 1924, when the Boston Bruins joined, and has since consisted of both American and Canadian teams. From 1942 to 1967, the NHL had only six teams, collectively nicknamed the &quot;Original Six&quot;. The league added six new teams to double its size as a result of the 1967 NHL expansion, then increased to 18 teams by 1974, and to 21 teams due to the 1979 NHL expansion. Between 1991 and 2000, the NHL further expanded to 30 teams. It added its 31st and 32nd teams in 2017 and 2021, respectively. Salt Lake City was awarded an expansion franchise in 2024; it acquired the hockey assets of the Arizona Coyotes, which were deactivated, and established the Utah Hockey Club, thus maintaining the total number of teams at 32.

The NHL is the fifth-highest grossing professional sports league in the world by revenue, after the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the Premier League. The league&#x27;s headquarters have been in Manhattan since 1989, when the head office moved from Montreal. There have been four league-wide work stoppages in NHL history, all occurring after 1992. , the NHL had players from 17 countries.

The NHL&#x27;s regular season is typically held from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. Following the conclusion of the regular season, 16 teams advance to the Stanley Cup playoffs, a four-round tournament that runs into June to determine the league champion. Since the league&#x27;s founding in 1917, the Montreal Canadiens have won the most combined NHL titles with 25, winning three NHL championship series before the league took full exclusivity of the Stanley Cup in 1926, and 22 Stanley Cups afterwards. The reigning league champions are the Florida Panthers, who defeated the Edmonton Oilers in the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals.

==History==

===Early years===
The National Hockey League was established in 1917 as the successor to the National Hockey Association (NHA). Founded in 1909, the NHA began play in 1910 with seven teams in Ontario and Quebec, and was one of the first major leagues in professional ice hockey. However, by its eighth season, a series of disputes with Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone led team owners of the Montreal Canadiens, the Montreal Wanderers, the Ottawa Senators, and the Quebec Bulldogs to hold a meeting to discuss the league&#x27;s future. Realizing the NHA constitution left them unable to force Livingstone out, the four teams voted instead to suspend the NHA, and, on November 26, 1917, formed the National Hockey League. Frank Calder was chosen as the NHL&#x27;s first president, serving until his death in 1943.

The Bulldogs were unable to play in the NHL, and the remaining owners founded the Toronto Arenas to compete with the Canadiens, Wanderers and Senators. The first games were played on December 19, 1917. The Montreal Arena burned down in January 1918, causing the Wanderers to cease operations, and the NHL continued on as a three-team league until the Bulldogs returned in 1919.
The NHL replaced the NHA as one of the leagues that competed for the Stanley Cup, an interleague competition at the time. Toronto won the first NHL title, and then defeated the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) for the 1918 Stanley Cup. The Canadiens won the league title in 1919, but the series in the Stanley Cup Finals against the PCHA&#x27;s Seattle Metropolitans was abandoned due to the Spanish Flu epidemic. In 1924, Montreal won their first Stanley Cup as a member of the NHL. The Hamilton Tigers won the regular season title in 1924–25, but refused to play in the championship series unless they were given a C$200 bonus. The league refused and declared the Canadiens the league champion after they defeated the Toronto St. Patricks (formerly the Arenas) in the two-game, total-goals NHL championship series. Montreal was then defeated by the Victoria Cougars of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) in 1925. It was the last time a non-NHL team won the trophy, as the Stanley Cup became the &quot;de facto&quot; NHL championship in 1926, after the WCHL ceased operation.

The National Hockey League embarked on a rapid expansion in the 1920s, adding the Montreal Maroons and the Boston Bruins in 1924, the latter being the first American team to join the league. The New York Americans began play in 1925 after purchasing the assets of the Hamilton Tigers, and they were joined by the Pittsburgh Pirates. The New York Rangers were added in 1926, and the Chicago Black Hawks (later changed to Blackhawks) and Detroit Cougars (later known as the Red Wings) were added after the league purchased the assets of the defunct WCHL. A group purchased the Toronto St. Patricks in 1927 and renamed them the Toronto Maple Leafs.

In 1926, Native American Taffy Abel became the first non-white player in the NHL and broke the league&#x27;s colour barrier by playing for the New York Rangers.

In 1934, the first NHL All-Star Game was held, to benefit Ace Bailey, whose career ended on a vicious hit by Eddie Shore. The second was held in 1937, in support of Howie Morenz&#x27;s family when he died of a coronary embolism after breaking his leg during a game.

===Original Six era===

The Great Depression and the onset of World War II took a toll on the league. The Pirates became the Philadelphia Quakers in 1930, then folded a year later. The Senators likewise became the St. Louis Eagles in 1934, also lasting only a year. The Maroons did not survive, as they suspended operations in 1938. The Americans were suspended in 1942 due to a lack of available players, and they were never reactivated.
For the 1942–43 season, the NHL was reduced to six teams: the Boston Bruins, the Chicago Black Hawks, the Detroit Red Wings, the Montreal Canadiens, the New York Rangers, and the Toronto Maple Leafs, a line-up, often referred to as the &quot;Original Six&quot;, that would remain constant for the next 25 years. In 1947, the league reached an agreement with the Stanley Cup trustees to take full control of the trophy, allowing it to reject challenges from other leagues that wished to play for the Cup.

In 1945, Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard became the first player to score 50 goals, doing so in a 50-game season. Richard later led the Canadiens to five consecutive titles between 1956 and 1960, a record no team has matched.

In 1948, Asian Canadian Larry Kwong became the first Asian player in the NHL by playing for the New York Rangers. In 1958, Willie O&#x27;Ree became the first black player in the league&#x27;s history when he made his debut with the Boston Bruins.

===Expansion era===
By the mid-1960s, the desire for a network television contract in the United States, coupled with concerns that the Western Hockey League was planning to declare itself a major league and challenge for the Stanley Cup, spurred the NHL to undertake its first expansion since the 1920s. The league doubled in size to 12 teams for the 1967–68 season, adding the Los Angeles Kings, the Minnesota North Stars, the Philadelphia Flyers, the Pittsburgh Penguins, the California Seals, and the St. Louis Blues. However, Canadian fans were outraged that all six teams were placed in the United States, so the league responded by adding the Vancouver Canucks in 1970, along with the Buffalo Sabres, both located on the Canada–United States border. Two years later, the emergence of the newly founded World Hockey Association (WHA) led the league to add the New York Islanders and the Atlanta Flames to keep the rival league out of those markets. In 1974, the Washington Capitals and the Kansas City Scouts were added, bringing the league up to 18 teams.
The NHL fought the WHA for players, losing 67 to the new league in its first season of 1972–73, including the Chicago Black Hawks&#x27; Bobby Hull, who signed a 10-year, $2.5 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets, then the largest in hockey history. The league attempted to block the defections in court, but a counter-suit by the WHA led to a Philadelphia judge ruling the NHL&#x27;s reserve clause to be illegal, thus eliminating the elder league&#x27;s monopoly over the players. Seven years of battling for players and markets financially damaged both leagues, leading to a merger agreement in 1979 that saw the WHA cease operations while the NHL absorbed the Winnipeg Jets, the Edmonton Oilers, the Hartford Whalers, and the Quebec Nordiques. The owners initially rejected this merger agreement by one vote, but a massive boycott of Molson Brewery products by Canadian fans resulted in the Montreal Canadiens, which was owned by Molson, reversing its position, along with the Vancouver Canucks. In a second vote, the plan was approved.

Wayne Gretzky played one season in the WHA for the Indianapolis Racers (eight games) and the Edmonton Oilers (72 games) before the Oilers joined the NHL for the 1979–80 season. Gretzky went on to lead the Oilers to win four Stanley Cup championships in 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1988, and set single-season records for goals (92 in 1981–82), assists (163 in 1985–86) and points (215 in 1985–86), as well as career records for goals (894), assists (1,963) and points (2,857). In 1988, he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in a deal that dramatically improved the league&#x27;s popularity in the United States. By the turn of the century, nine more teams were added to the NHL: the San Jose Sharks, the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Ottawa Senators, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, the Florida Panthers, the Nashville Predators, the Atlanta Thrashers, and, in 2000, the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets. Also, in the mid to late 1990s, the Quebec Nordiques, original Winnipeg Jets, and Hartford Whalers relocated to Denver, Phoenix, and Raleigh. In 2011, the Atlanta Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg, and the Winnipeg Jets were revived. On July 21, 2015, the NHL confirmed that it had received applications from prospective ownership groups in Quebec City and Las Vegas for possible expansion teams, and on June 22, 2016, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced the addition of a 31st franchise, based in Las Vegas and later named the Vegas Golden Knights, into the NHL for the 2017–18 season. On December 4, 2018, the league announced a 32nd franchise in Seattle, later named the Seattle Kraken, which joined in the 2021–22 season. On April 18, 2024, the Arizona Coyotes suspended operations and sold their hockey assets, including players and other personnel, to a new team in Salt Lake City, Utah. Two months after Utah&#x27;s foundation, the Coyotes ceased their efforts to re-activate within the five-year window granted to do so, bringing the NHL back to 32 franchises.

===Labour issues===
There have been four league-wide work stoppages in NHL history, all occurring after 1992. The first was an April 1992 strike by the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association, which lasted for ten days but was settled quickly with all affected games rescheduled.

A lockout at the start of the 1994–95 season forced the league to reduce the schedule from 84 games to 48, with the teams playing only intra-conference games during the reduced season. The resulting collective bargaining agreement (CBA) was set for renegotiation in 1998, and extended to September 15, 2004.

With no new agreement in hand when the contract expired, league commissioner Gary Bettman announced a lockout of the players union and closed the league&#x27;s head office for the 2004–05 season. The league vowed to install what it dubbed &quot;cost certainty&quot; for its teams, but the Players&#x27; Association countered that the move was little more than a euphemism for a salary cap, which the union initially said it would not accept. The lockout shut down the league for 310 days, making it the longest in sports history, as the NHL became the first professional sports league to lose an entire season. A new collective bargaining agreement was eventually ratified in July 2005, including a salary cap. The agreement had a term of six years with an option of extending the collective bargaining agreement for an additional year at the end of the term, allowing the league to resume as of the 2005–06 season.

On October 5, 2005, the first post-lockout season took to the ice with all 30 teams. The NHL received record attendance in the 2005–06 season, with an average of 16,955 per game. However, its television audience was slower to rebound due to American cable broadcaster ESPN&#x27;s decision to drop its NHL coverage. The league&#x27;s post-lockout agreement with NBC gave the league a share of revenue from each game&#x27;s advertising sales, rather than the usual lump sum paid up front for game rights. The league&#x27;s annual revenues were estimated at $2.27 billion.

On September 16, 2012, the labour pact expired, and the league again locked out the players. The owners proposed reducing the players&#x27; share of hockey-related revenues from 57 percent to 47 percent. All games were cancelled up to January 14, 2013, along with the 2013 NHL Winter Classic and the 2013 NHL All-Star Weekend. On January 6, a tentative agreement was reached on a 10-year deal. On January 12, the league and the Players&#x27; Association signed a memorandum of understanding on the new deal, allowing teams to begin their training camps the next day, with a shortened 48-game season schedule that began on January 19.

===Player safety issues===
Player safety has become a major issue in the NHL, with concussions resulting from a hard hit to the head being the primary concern. Recent studies have shown how the consequences of concussions can last beyond player retirement. This has significant effects on the league, as elite players have suffered from the aftereffects of concussions (such as Sidney Crosby being sidelined for approximately ten and a half months), which adversely affects the league&#x27;s marketability. In December 2009, Brendan Shanahan was hired to replace Colin Campbell, and was given the role of senior vice-president of player safety. Shanahan began to hand out suspensions on high-profile perpetrators responsible for dangerous hits, such as Raffi Torres receiving 25 games for his hit on Marian Hossa.

To aid with removing high-speed collisions on icing, which had led to several potential career-ending injuries, such as to Hurricanes&#x27; defenceman Joni Pitkanen, the league mandated hybrid no-touch icing for the 2013–14 NHL season.

On November 25, 2013, ten former NHL players (Gary Leeman, Rick Vaive, Brad Aitken, Darren Banks, Curt Bennett, Richie Dunn, Warren Holmes, Bob Manno, Blair Stewart, and Morris Titanic) sued the league for negligence in protecting players from concussions. The suit came three months after the National Football League agreed to pay former players US$765 million due to a player safety lawsuit.

===Women in the NHL===
From 1952 to 1955, Marguerite Norris served as president of the Detroit Red Wings, being the first female NHL executive and the first woman to have her name engraved on the Stanley Cup. In 1992, Manon Rhéaume became the first woman to play a game in any of the major professional North American sports leagues, as a goaltender for the Tampa Bay Lightning in a preseason game against the St. Louis Blues, stopping seven of nine shots. In 2016, Dawn Braid was hired as the Arizona Coyotes&#x27; skating coach, making her the first female full-time coach in the NHL. The first female referees in the NHL were hired in a test-run during the league&#x27;s preseason prospect tournaments in September 2019.

In 2016, the NHL hosted the 2016 Outdoor Women&#x27;s Classic, an exhibition game between the Boston Pride of the National Women&#x27;s Hockey League and Les Canadiennes of the Canadian Women&#x27;s Hockey League, as part of the 2016 NHL Winter Classic weekend festivities. In 2019, the NHL invited four women from the US and Canadian Olympic teams to demonstrate the events in All-Star skills competition before the All-Star Game. Due to Nathan MacKinnon choosing not to participate following a bruised ankle, Team USA&#x27;s Kendall Coyne Schofield competed in the Fastest Skater competition in his place, becoming the first woman to officially compete in the NHL&#x27;s All-Star festivities. The attention led the NHL to include a 3-on-3 women&#x27;s game before the 2020 All-Star Game. Rheaume returned to perform as a goaltender for the 2022 NHL All-Star Game&#x27;s Breakaway Challenge.

==Teams==

From the 2017–18 season to the 2019–20 season, the NHL consisted of 31 teams—24 based in the United States and 7 in Canada. The NHL divided the 31 teams into two conferences: the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference. Each conference was split into two divisions: the Eastern Conference contained 16 teams (eight per division), while the Western Conference had 15 teams (seven in the Central and eight in the Pacific). The league temporarily realigned for the 2020–21 season but returned to the previous alignment the following year. With the addition of the Seattle Kraken in 2021–22 to the Pacific Division and the Arizona Coyotes&#x27; move from the Pacific to the Central, all four divisions now have eight teams each and both conferences have 16 teams.

The number of NHL teams held constant at 30 teams from the 2000–01 season, when the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets joined the league as expansion teams, until 2017. That expansion capped a period in the 1990s of rapid expansion and relocation, when the NHL added nine teams to grow from 21 to 30 teams, and relocated four teams mostly from smaller, northern cities to larger, more southern metropolitan areas (Minneapolis to Dallas, Quebec City to Denver, Winnipeg to Phoenix, and Hartford to Raleigh). The league has not contracted any teams since the Cleveland Barons were merged into the Minnesota North Stars in 1978. The league expanded for the first time in 17 years to 31 teams with the addition of the Vegas Golden Knights in 2017, then to 32 with the addition of the Seattle Kraken in 2021. In April 2024, a new expansion team in Utah was created, after Alex Meruelo sold the hockey assets of the Arizona Coyotes to Ryan Smith, owner of the Utah Jazz. Meruelo was granted until 2029 to secure an arena in Arizona in order to re-activate the team, bringing the total number of franchises in the NHL up to 33; however, these efforts were abandoned two months later, leaving the NHL at 32 franchises once again.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, in 2023, the top five most valuable teams were four of the &quot;Original Six&quot; teams and the Los Angeles Kings:
#Toronto Maple Leafs – US$2.8 billion
#New York Rangers – US$2.65 billion
#Montreal Canadiens – US$2.3 billion
#Los Angeles Kings – US$2 billion
#Boston Bruins – US$1.9 billion
The remaining members of the Original Six, the Chicago Blackhawks and the Detroit Red Wings, respectively ranked sixth at US$1.87 billion and hypothetically 12th at US$1.3 billion. Compared with 2022, the Maple Leafs surpassed the Rangers as the most valuable NHL team, and Los Angeles overtook both Chicago and Boston, making its way into the top five.

==Organizational structure==
===Board of Governors===
The Board of Governors is the ruling and governing body of the National Hockey League. In this context, each team is a member of the league, and each member appoints a Governor (usually the owner of the club), and two alternates to the Board. The current chairman of the Board is Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs. The Board of Governors exists to establish the policies of the league and to uphold its constitution. Some of the responsibilities of the Board of Governors include:
* review and approve any changes to the league&#x27;s rules.
* hiring and firing of the commissioner.
* review and approve the purchase, sale or relocation of any member club.
* review and approve the salary caps for member clubs.
* review and approve any changes to the structure of the game schedule.

The Board of Governors meets twice per year, in the months of June and December, with the exact date and place to be fixed by the Commissioner.

===Executives===

The chief executive of the league is commissioner Gary Bettman. Some other senior executives include chief legal officer Bill Daly, director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, and senior vice president of player safety George Parros. A committee led by Bettman and chairman Jeremy Jacobs is responsible for vetting new ownership applications, collective bargaining, and league expansion. Other members include Mark Chipman, N. Murray Edwards, Craig Leipold, Ted Leonsis, Geoff Molson, Henry Samueli, Larry Tanenbaum, Jeff Vinik, and David Blitzer.

==Rule differences with international hockey==

The National Hockey League&#x27;s rules are one of the two standard sets of professional ice hockey rules in the world, the other being the rules of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), as used in tournaments such as the Olympics. The IIHF rules are derived from the Canadian amateur ice hockey rules of the early 20th century, while the NHL rules evolved directly from the first organized indoor ice hockey game in Montreal in 1875, updated by subsequent leagues up to 1917, when the NHL adopted the existing NHA set of rules. The NHL&#x27;s rules are the basis for rules governing most professional and major junior ice hockey leagues in North America.

The NHL hockey rink is , approximately the same length but much narrower than IIHF standards. A trapezoidal area appears behind each goal net. The goaltender can play the puck only within the trapezoid or in front of the goal line; if the goaltender plays the puck behind the goal line and outside the trapezoidal area, a two-minute minor penalty for delay of game is assessed. The rule is unofficially nicknamed the &quot;Martin Brodeur rule&quot;; Brodeur at the time was one of the best goaltenders at getting behind the net to handle the puck. Since the 2013–14 season, the league trimmed the goal frames by on each side and reduced the size of the goalies&#x27; leg pads.

The league has regularly modified its rules to counter perceived imperfections in the game. The penalty shot was adopted from the Pacific Coast Hockey Association to ensure players were not being blocked from opportunities to score. For the 2005–06 season, the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside. First, the league removed the &quot;offside pass&quot; or &quot;two-line pass&quot; rule, which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team&#x27;s defending zone was completed on the offensive side of the centre line, unless the puck crossed the line before the player. Furthermore, the league reinstated the &quot;tag-up offside&quot; which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone. The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring, which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid-nineties and the increased prevalence of the neutral zone trap. Since 2005, when a team is guilty of icing the puck they are not allowed to make a line change or skater substitution of any sort before the following face-off (except to replace an injured player or re-install a pulled goaltender). Since 2013, the league has used &quot;hybrid icing&quot;, where a linesman stops play due to icing if a defending player (other than the goaltender) crosses the imaginary line that connects the two face-off dots in their defensive zone before an attacking player is able to. This was done to counter a trend of player injury in races to the puck.

Fighting in the NHL leads to &quot;major penalties&quot; while IIHF rules, and most amateur rules, call for the ejection of fighting players. Usually, a penalized team cannot replace a player that is penalized on the ice and is thus short-handed for the duration of the penalty, but if the penalties are coincidental, for example when two players fight, both teams remain at full strength. Also, unlike minor penalties, major penalties must be served to their full completion, regardless of number of goals scored during the power play.

The league also imposes a conduct policy on its players. Players are banned from gambling and criminal activities have led to the suspension of players. The league and the Players&#x27; Association agreed to a stringent anti-doping policy in the 2005 collective bargaining agreement. The policy provides for a twenty-game suspension for a first positive test, a sixty-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test.

At the end of regulation time, the team with the most goals wins the game. If a game is tied after regulation time, overtime ensues. During the regular season, overtime is a five-minute, three-on-three sudden-death period, in which whoever scores a goal first wins the game. If the game is still tied at the end of overtime, the game enters a shootout. Three players for each team in turn take a penalty shot. The team with the most goals during the three-round shootout wins the game. If the game is still tied after the three shootout rounds, the shootout continues but becomes sudden-death. Whichever team ultimately wins the shootout is awarded a goal in the game score and thus awarded two points in the standings. The losing team in overtime or shootout is awarded one point. Shootout goals and saves are not tracked in hockey statistics; shootout statistics are tracked separately.

There are no shootouts during the playoffs. Instead, multiple sudden-death, 20-minute five-on-five periods are played until one team scores. Two games have reached six overtime periods, but none have gone beyond six. During playoff overtime periods, the only break is to clean the loose ice at the first stoppage after the period is halfway finished.

==Season structure==
The National Hockey League season is divided into a preseason (September and early October), a regular season (from early October through early to mid-April) and a postseason (the Stanley Cup playoffs).

Teams usually hold a summer showcase for prospects in July and participate in prospect tournaments, full games that do not feature any veterans, in September. Full training camps begin in mid-to-late September, including a preseason consisting of six to eight exhibition games. Split squad games, in which parts of a team&#x27;s regular season roster play separate games on the same day, are occasionally played during the preseason.

During the regular season, clubs play each other in a predefined schedule. Since 2021, in the regular season, all teams play 82 games: 41 games each of home and road, playing 26 games in their own geographic division—four against five of their seven other divisional opponents, plus three against two others; 24 games against the eight remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents—three games against every team in the other division of its conference; and 32 against every team in the other conference twice—home and road.

The league&#x27;s regular season standings are based on a point system. Two points are awarded for a win, one point for losing in overtime or a shootout, and zero points for a loss in regulation. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion, and the league&#x27;s overall leader is awarded the Presidents&#x27; Trophy.

The Stanley Cup playoffs, which go from April to the beginning of June, are an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best-of-seven series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion. Eight teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs: the top three teams in each division plus the two conference teams with the next highest number of points. The two conference champions proceed to the Stanley Cup Finals. In all rounds, the higher-ranked team is awarded home-ice advantage, with four of the seven games played at this team&#x27;s home venue. In the Stanley Cup Finals, the team with the most points during the regular season has home-ice advantage.

==Entry draft==
The annual NHL entry draft consists of a seven-round off-season draft held in June on a date of the commissioner&#x27;s choosing. Early NHL drafts took place at the Queen Elizabeth (currently Fairmont) Hotel in Montreal. Amateur players from junior, collegiate, or European leagues are eligible to enter the entry draft. The selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season, playoff results, and a draft lottery. The 16 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round, with the last place team having the best chance of winning the lottery. Once the lottery determines the initial draft picks, the order for the remaining non-playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season. For those teams that did qualify for the playoffs, the draft order is then determined by total regular season points for non-division winners that are eliminated in the first two rounds of the playoffs, then any division winners that failed to reach the Conference Finals. Conference finalists receive the 29th and 30th picks depending on total points, with the Stanley Cup runner-up given the 31st pick and the Stanley Cup champions the final pick.

==Trophies and awards==
===Teams===
The most prestigious team award is the Stanley Cup, which is awarded to the league champion at the end of the Stanley Cup playoffs. The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the Presidents&#x27; Trophy.

The Montreal Canadiens are the most successful franchise in the league. Since the formation of the league in 1917, they have 25 NHL championships (three between 1917 and 1925 when the Stanley Cup was still contested in an interleague competition, twenty-two since 1926 after the Stanley Cup became the NHL&#x27;s championship trophy). They also lead all teams with 24 Stanley Cup championships (one as an NHA team, twenty-three as an NHL team). Of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, the Montreal Canadiens are surpassed in the number of championships only by the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball, who have three more.

The longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five, held by the Montreal Canadiens from 1955–56 to 1959–60. The 1977 edition of the Montreal Canadiens, the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions, was named by ESPN as the second greatest sports team of all time.

The next most successful NHL franchise is the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 Stanley Cup championships, most recently in 1967. The Detroit Red Wings, with 11 Stanley Cup championships, are the most successful American franchise.

The same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards. The Stanley Cup, much like its counterpart in the Canadian Football League (CFL), is unique in this aspect, as opposed to the Vince Lombardi Trophy, Larry O&#x27;Brien Trophy, and Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy, which have new ones made every year for that year&#x27;s champion. Despite only one trophy being used, the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup. The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year.

====Division titles====
Apart from the NHL-sanctioned trophies, which teams often recognize by putting up banners in the rafters of their arenas, many teams also claim titles which are not represented by trophies, often also by putting up banners in their rafters. One example is the division title or division championship. The term unambiguously refers to the team that received the most points in its division at the end of the regular season, but in some previous seasons, for example, from 1926–27 to 1927–28 and from 1981–82 to 1992–93, when the playoffs where organized along divisions, the term without qualification could also refer to the team which won the corresponding playoff series. The NHL has made clear in the past that it only allows teams to recognize regular season division titles.

===Players===
There are numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season; they include, among others, the Art Ross Trophy for the league scoring champion (goals and assists), the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy for the goal-scoring leader, and the William M. Jennings Trophy for the goaltender(s) for the team with the fewest goals against them.

The other player trophies are voted on by the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association or the team general managers. These individual awards are presented at a formal ceremony held in late June after the playoffs have concluded. The most prestigious individual award is the Hart Memorial Trophy which is awarded annually to the Most Valuable Player; the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season. The Vezina Trophy is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goaltender as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL. The James Norris Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the National Hockey League&#x27;s top defenceman, the Calder Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the top rookie, and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship; all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association.

In addition to the regular season awards, the Conn Smythe Trophy is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL&#x27;s Stanley Cup playoffs. Furthermore, the top coach in the league wins the Jack Adams Award, as selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association. The National Hockey League publishes the names of the top three vote getters for all awards, and then names the award winner during the NHL Awards Ceremony.

Players, coaches, officials, and team builders who have had notable careers are eligible to be voted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Players cannot enter until three years have passed since their last professional game, currently tied with the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame for the shortest such time period of any major sport. One unique consequence has been Hall of Fame members (specifically, Gordie Howe, Guy Lafleur, and Mario Lemieux) coming out of retirement to play once more. If a player was deemed significant enough, the three-year wait would be waived; only ten individuals have been honoured in this manner. In 1999, Wayne Gretzky joined the Hall and became the last player to have the three-year restriction waived. After his induction, the Hall of Fame announced that Gretzky would be the last to have the waiting period waived.

==Origin of players==

In addition to Canadian- and American-born and trained players, who have historically composed a large majority of NHL rosters, the NHL also draws players from an expanding pool of other nations where organized and professional hockey is played. Since the collapse of the Soviet Bloc, political/ideological restrictions on the movement of hockey players from this region have disappeared, leading to a large influx of players mostly from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Russia into the NHL. Swedes, Finns, and Western European players, who were always free to move to North America, came to the league in greater numbers than before.

Many of the league&#x27;s top players in recent years have come from these European countries including Daniel Alfredsson, Erik Karlsson, Henrik Sedin, Daniel Sedin, Henrik Lundqvist, Jaromir Jagr, Patrik Elias, Zdeno Chara, Pavel Datsyuk, Evgeni Malkin, Nicklas Lidstrom, and Alexander Ovechkin. European players were drafted and signed by NHL teams in an effort to bring in more &quot;skilled offensive players&quot;, although as of 2008 there has been a decline in European players as more American players enter the league. The addition of European players changed the style of play in the NHL and European style hockey has been integrated into the NHL game.

As of the 2017–18 season, the NHL has players from 17 countries, with 46.0% coming from Canada and 26.0% from the United States, while players from a further 15 countries make up 26.4% of NHL rosters. The following table shows the seven countries that make up the vast majority of NHL players. The table follows the Hockey Hall of Fame convention of classifying players by the currently existing countries in which their birthplaces are located, without regard to their citizenship or where they were trained.
==Corporate sponsors==

The NHL lists its several official corporate partners into three categories: North American Partners, USA Partners and Canada Partners. Discover Card is the league&#x27;s official credit card in the United States, while competitor Visa is an official sponsor in Canada. Likewise, Tim Hortons is the league&#x27;s official coffee and doughnuts chain in Canada, while Dunkin&#x27; Donuts is the NHL&#x27;s sponsor in the United States.

Among its North American corporate sponsors, Kraft Heinz sponsors &quot;Kraft Hockeyville&quot;, an annual competition in which communities compete to demonstrate their commitment to the sport of ice hockey. The winning community gets a cash prize dedicated to upgrading their local home arena, as well as the opportunity to host an NHL pre-season game. Two contests are held, one for communities across Canada and a separate competition for communities in the US.

At least two of the North American corporate sponsors have ties to NHL franchise owners: the Molson family, founders of Molson Brewery, has owned the Montreal Canadiens for years, while SAP was co-founded by Hasso Plattner, the current majority owner of the San Jose Sharks.

Many of these same corporate partners become the title sponsors for the league&#x27;s All-Star and outdoor games.

Beginning in the 2020–21 NHL season, the league allowed for advertising on its gameday uniforms for the first time, starting with helmet ads. The NHL has had advertising on the front of team jerseys starting from the 2022–23 season.

On May 14, 2021, NHL and the sports-betting company Betway announced a multi-year partnership in which Betway became the official sports betting partner to the NHL in North America.

==Media coverage==


===Canada===
Broadcasting rights in Canada have historically included the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; (&quot;HNIC&quot;), a Canadian tradition dating to 1952, and even prior to that on radio since the 1920s.

The current national television and digital rightsholder is Rogers Communications, under a 12-year deal valued at C$5.2 billion which began in the 2014–15 season, as the national broadcast and cable television rightsholders. National English-language coverage of the NHL is carried primarily by Rogers&#x27; Sportsnet group of specialty channels; Sportsnet holds national windows on Wednesday and Sunday nights. &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; was maintained and expanded under the deal, airing up to seven games nationally on Saturday nights throughout the regular season. CBC maintains Rogers-produced NHL coverage during the regular season and playoffs. Sportsnet&#x27;s networks also air occasional games involving all-U.S. matchups.

Quebecor Media holds national French-language rights to the NHL, with all coverage airing on its specialty channel TVA Sports.

Games that are not broadcast as part of the national rights deal are broadcast by Sportsnet&#x27;s regional feeds, TSN&#x27;s regional feeds, and RDS. Regional games are subject to blackout for viewers outside of each team&#x27;s designated market.

===United States===

Historically, the NHL has never fared well on American television in comparison to the other American professional leagues. The league&#x27;s American broadcast partners had been in flux for decades prior to 1995. Hockey broadcasting on a national scale was particularly spotty prior to 1981; NBC, CBS, and ABC held rights at various times during that period but with limited schedules during the second half of the regular season and the playoffs, along with some (but not all) of the Stanley Cup Finals. The NHL primarily was then only available on cable television after 1981, airing on the USA Network, SportsChannel America, and ESPN at various times. Since 1995, national coverage has been split between broadcast and cable, first with Fox and ESPN from 1995 to 1999, then followed by ABC and ESPN from 1999 to 2004. The U.S. national rights were then held by NBC and OLN (later renamed Versus, then NBCSN) between the 2004–05 NHL lockout and 2021.

The 2021–22 season marks the first year of seven-year agreements with ESPN and TNT (formerly Turner) Sports. ESPN&#x27;s deal includes 25 regular season games on ABC or ESPN, and 75 exclusive games streamed on ESPN+ and Hulu. Turner Sports&#x27; coverage includes up to 72 regular season games on TNT, with early round playoff coverage split between TNT and TBS. The playoffs will be split between ESPN and TNT, with ABC televising the Stanley Cup Finals during even years and TNT (simulcast with TBS and TruTV) televising the championship series during odd years.

As in Canada, games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team&#x27;s home market and are subject to blackout outside of them. These broadcasters include regional sports network chains. Certain national telecasts are non-exclusive, and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters. However, national telecasts of these games are blacked out in the participating teams&#x27; markets to protect the local broadcaster.

===NHL Network===
The league co-owns the NHL Network, a television specialty channel devoted to the NHL. Its signature show is &quot;NHL Tonight&quot;. The NHL Network also airs live games, but primarily simulcasts of one of the team&#x27;s regional broadcasters.

===Out-of-market packages===
NHL Centre Ice in Canada and NHL Center Ice in the United States are the league&#x27;s subscription-based, out-of-market sports packages that offer access to out-of-market feeds of games through a cable or satellite television provider.

The league originally launched &quot;NHL GameCenter Live&quot; in 2008, allowing the streaming of out-of-market games over the internet. MLB Advanced Media then took over of its day-to-day operations in 2016, renaming it &quot;NHL.tv&quot;. Under its contract, Rogers Communications distributes the service in Canada as &quot;NHL Live&quot;; it will be incorporated into Sportsnet Now Premium for the 2022–23 season. Under ESPN&#x27;s contract, the league&#x27;s out-of-market streaming package was incorporated into ESPN+ for those viewers in the United States in 2021.

===International===
Outside of Canada and the United States, NHL games are broadcast across Europe, in the Middle East, in Australia, and in the Americas across Mexico, Central America, Dominican Republic, Caribbean, South America and Brazil, among others.

&quot;NHL.tv&quot; is also available for people in most countries to watch games online, but blackout restrictions may still apply if a game is being televised in the user&#x27;s country. For those in selected international markets where ESPN also holds the streaming rights, they must instead access games on the ESPN platform used in that particular country: ESPNPlayer, ESPN Play, the ESPN App, or Disney+ (previously Star+). And those in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom must use Viaplay.

==International competitions==
===Club participation===
NHL teams have occasionally participated in international club competitions. Most of these competitions were arranged by the NHL or NHLPA. The first international club competition was held in 1976, with eight NHL teams playing against the Soviet Championship League&#x27;s HC CSKA Moscow, and Krylya Sovetov Moscow. Between 1976 and 1991, the NHL, and the Soviet Championship League would hold several exhibition games between the two leagues known as the Super Series. No NHL club had played a Soviet or Russian-based club from the end of the Super Series in 1991 to 2008 when the New York Rangers faced Metallurg Magnitogorsk in the 2008 Victoria Cup.

In addition to the Russian clubs, NHL clubs had participated in several international club exhibitions and competitions with various European-based clubs. The first exhibition game to feature an NHL team against a European-based team (aside from clubs based in the former Soviet Union) was in December 1977, when the New York Rangers faced Poldi Kladno of the Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League. In the 2000s, the NHL organized four NHL Challenge series between NHL and European clubs. The NHL continued to organize exhibition games between NHL and European teams before the beginning of the NHL season; those games were known as the NHL Premiere from 2007 to 2011 and as the NHL Global Series since 2017. The last exhibition game between an NHL and European club occurred during the 2024 NHL Global Series. 

NHL clubs have also participated in IIHF-organized club tournaments. The most recent IIHF-organized event including an NHL club was the 2009 Victoria Cup, between the Swiss National League A&#x27;s ZSC Lions and the Chicago Blackhawks.

===Permittance of NHL players in international competitions===

The NHL has also permitted its players to participate in international competitions among national teams. The annual Ice Hockey World Championships is held every May, at the same time as the Stanley Cup playoffs. Because of its timing, NHL players generally only join their respective country&#x27;s team in the World Championships if their respective NHL team has been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention. 

From 1998 to 2014, during the year of the quadrennial Winter Olympics, the NHL suspended its all-star game and expanded the traditional all-star break to allow NHL players to participate in the Olympic ice hockey tournament. In 2018, the NHL did not schedule an Olympic break, resulting in their players not participating in that year&#x27;s Olympic tournament. An Olympic break was also not scheduled in 2022, with the NHL opting to not permit its players to participate due to a shortened NHL season that year, and concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. The NHL, NHLPA, and IIHF have agreed to permit NHL players participate in the 2026 and 2030 Winter Olympics. The NHL and the NHLPA also organize the World Cup of Hockey. Unlike the Ice Hockey World Championships and the Olympic tournament, the World Cup of Hockey is played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF.

In 2007, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) formalized the &quot;Triple Gold Club&quot;, the group of players and coaches who have won an Olympic gold medal, a World Championship gold medal and the Stanley Cup. The term had first entered popular use following the 2002 Winter Olympics, which saw the addition of the first Canadian members.

==Popularity==

The NHL is considered one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, along with Major League Baseball, the National Football League, and the National Basketball Association. The league is very prominent in Canada, where it is the most popular of these four leagues. Overall, hockey has the smallest total fan base of the four leagues and receives the smallest annual revenue; the league earns the least from the television rights sale and has the lowest sponsorship.

The NHL had been the sport holding the most affluent fan base of the top four, but it slid behind the MLB and leveled off with the NFL in recent years. A study done by the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2004, found that NHL fans in the United States were the most educated of the four major leagues. Further, it noted that season-ticket sales were more prominent in the NHL than the other three because of the financial ability of the NHL fan to purchase them. The NHL has the most white-based audience among the four. According to Reuters, in 2010, the largest demographic of NHL fans was males aged 18–34.
The NHL estimates that half of its fan base roots for teams in outside markets. So, beginning in 2008, the NHL started to shift toward using digital technology to market to fans to capitalize on this.

The debut of the Winter Classic, an outdoor regular season NHL game held on New Year&#x27;s Day in 2008, was a significant success for the league. The game has since become an annual staple of the NHL schedule. Coverage of &quot;Hockey Day in America&quot;, later rebranded as Hockey Weekend Across America with TNT, allowed for multiple games to be broadcast in the United States on the national rights holder. These improvements led NBC and the cable channel Versus to sign a 10-year broadcast deal, paying US$200 million per year for both American cable and broadcast rights; the deal will lead to further increases in television coverage on the NBC channels.

This television contract has boosted viewership metrics for the NHL. The 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs saw the largest audience in the sport&#x27;s history &quot;after a regular season that saw record-breaking business success, propelled largely by the NHL&#x27;s strategy of engaging fans through big events and robust digital offerings.&quot; This success has resulted in a 66 percent rise in NHL advertising and sponsorship revenue. Merchandise sales were up 22 percent, and the number of unique visitors on the NHL.com website was up 17 percent during the playoffs after rising 29 percent in the regular season.

<text>Northern Michigan University (Northern Michigan, Northern or NMU) is a public university in Marquette, Michigan, United States. It was established in 1899 by the Michigan Legislature as Northern State Normal School. In 1963, the state designated the school a university and gave it the current name. The university comprises five academic divisions, offering some 180 programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Accredited undergraduate and graduate degree programs are offered by the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business, the College of Health Sciences and Professional Studies. NMU&#x27;s athletic teams are nicknamed the Wildcats and compete primarily in the NCAA Division II Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference; the hockey team competes in NCAA Division I Central Collegiate Hockey Association and the Nordic ski team competes in the Central Collegiate Ski Association.

==History==
Northern Michigan University was established in 1899 by the Michigan Legislature as Northern State Normal School to offer teacher preparation programs in Michigan&#x27;s then-wild and sparsely populated Upper Peninsula. When it opened in 1899, NMU enrolled thirty-two students who were taught by six faculty members in rented rooms in Marquette city hall. The original campus site at the corner of Presque Isle and Kaye Avenues was on land donated by local businessman and philanthropist John M. Longyear, whose namesake academic building, Longyear Hall, opened in 1900.

Throughout the school&#x27;s first half-century, education and teacher training was the school&#x27;s primary focus. During this time, the school built the native sandstone buildings Kaye and Peter White Halls, as well as a manual training school next to the campus buildings, J.D. Pierce School. Modest enrollment increases led to several name changes:

*Northern State Normal, 1899
*Northern State Teachers College, 1927
*Northern Michigan College of Education, 1942
*Northern Michigan College, 1955
In 1963, through the adoption of a new state constitution in Michigan, Northern Michigan was designated a comprehensive university serving the diverse educational needs of Upper Michigan. During this time, enrollment grew, due in large part to the 1957 opening of the Mackinac Bridge that links the Upper and Lower Peninsulas. Accredited undergraduate and graduate degree programs are offered by the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business, the College of Health Sciences and Professional Studies.

Graduate education began in March 1935 when courses at the master&#x27;s degree level were offered in cooperation with the University of Michigan.

<text>Naked News is a Canadian news and entertainment program owned by Naked Broadcasting Network. It features nude female news presenters reading news bulletins derived from news wires. The show&#x27;s production studio is located in Toronto. There are six daily news programs a week and they are approximately 20 minutes long. The female cast members either read the news fully nude, or disrobe as they present their various segments, including entertainment, sports, movies, food, sex and relationships. &quot;Naked News TV!&quot; is an offshoot of the web program and is broadcast on pay TV in various countries around the world. The show recruits women from around the world to appear on a regular basis or as guest reporters, and their auditions are included in the program. Another segment of the show is &quot;Naked in the Streets&quot; in which a reporter appears topless in the street and asks the public about various topics.

== History ==
&quot;Naked News&quot; was conceived by Fernando Pereira and Kirby Stasyna and debuted in December 1999 as a web-based news service featuring an all-female cast. 

It began with only one anchor, Victoria Sinclair, who worked for the program until 2015. As the show grew, the number of female anchors increased. Roxanne West joined Sinclair as a lead anchor, and other cast members included Holly Weston, April Torres, Lily Kwan, Sandrine Renard, Erin Sherwood, Athena King, Brooke Roberts, Michelle Pantoliano, Erica Stevens, Samantha Page, Christine Kerr and Valentina Taylor, plus guest anchors. 

The website was popularized entirely by word of mouth, and quickly became a popular web destination. During the height of its popularity, the website was receiving over 6 million unique visitors per month. In the site&#x27;s early days, the entire newscast could be viewed for free online. The site was initially supported by advertising, but this changed after the collapse of Internet advertising that occurred with the dot-com crash. By 2002, only one news segment could be viewed for free, and by 2004, no free content remained on the website. Beginning in 2005, a nudity-free version of &quot;Naked News&quot; was available to non-subscribers. Beginning in June 2008, two news segments could be viewed for free. However, this ended in December 2009.

In 2001, following the success of &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;, a similar show on Russian television, the &quot;Naked News&quot; website launched &quot;Naked News TV!&quot;, a 45-minute show initially broadcast on the pay-per-view cable television channel Viewers Choice in Canada. It was broadcast in the United States a few months later by the iN DEMAND cable TV service on its Too Much for TV pay-per-view network that also included &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot;. In 2002, it was broadcast in Australia on The Comedy Channel via cable and satellite television platforms Foxtel and Austar. The British channel Sumo TV briefly showed episodes of &quot;Naked News&quot;, while the free-to-view Playboy One broadcast the show at 9:30pm Mondays-Fridays until its closure in 2008.

A male version of the show ran from 2001 until 2007. It was created to parallel the female version, but ceased production as it did not enjoy the female version&#x27;s popularity and fame. Although it was originally targeted towards female viewers (at one point said to be 30% of the website&#x27;s audience), the male show later promoted itself as news from a gay perspective.

By 2008, &quot;Naked News TV!&quot; was available on pay-per-view in the US, Europe, Australia, Asia and Canada, while the &quot;Naked News&quot; website had viewers in more than 172 nations 

==In the media==
In the 2000s, &quot;Naked News&quot; was the subject of a UK-funded documentary called &quot;Naked News - Backstage&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;Naked News&quot; was the subject of an eight-part documentary series called &quot;Naked News Uncovered&quot;, which was broadcast on Super Channel in Canada.

The female announcers have been featured on (&quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;The View&quot;, &quot;Sally Jessy Raphaël&quot;, and numerous appearances on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; and &quot;ET Insider&quot;), newspapers and magazines (&quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;), and as guests on several radio shows, including Howard Stern.

== Similar shows ==

In the late 1990s, British cable television channel L!VE TV broadcast &quot;Tiffani&#x27;s Big City Tips&quot;, in which model Tiffani Banister gave the financial news while stripping to her underwear.

=== International licensing ===
* &quot;Naked News&quot; launched a Japanese version of the show in 2006. Sunrise Corp. CEO Takuya Uchikawa and Naked News owner eGalaxy Multimedia CEO David Warga partnered the venture, starting with Naked News content using Japanese subtitles. Japanese broadcasting regulations prohibited the presenters from being fully naked, allowing them only to strip to their underwear. In 2007, the Japanese government changed broadcasting guidelines to prevent the show receiving a subsidy for the section delivered in sign language.
* In 2008, licensing negotiations were underway to produce an Italian-language version of the show in Milan, a Spanish-language version in Mexico and Korean-language version in South Korea.
* In June 2009, plans for &quot;Naked News Korea&quot; were announced. It featured a similar format to the Canadian version but with less nudity. This was later revealed to be a scam. After barely a month of operations, &quot;Naked News Korea&quot;, which featured topless news anchors, abruptly closed down amid allegations that the company&#x27;s two heads, an Israeli entrepreneur, Yoav Sinai and a New Zealander investor of Chinese descent, CEO John Chau (Chow) left the country without paying deferred salaries. Although Chau bought the naming rights from the &quot;Naked News&quot;, it was never an official subsidiary of the Toronto-based Canadian company.

===Imitators===
* &quot;Comédie+&quot; – In 2001, this French cable TV network ran a series promos featuring males and females casually undressing as they read jokes. In 2006 they copied the &quot;Naked News&quot; format more closely in a striptease newscast called &quot;Les Nuz&quot;, in which the anchors read the news wearing only their bottom underwear.
* Radio Tango – In 2001 this radio station based in Oslo, Norway began featuring stripping female weather readers in their broadcasts and on their website.
* A very similar phenomenon by the name &quot;Noodie News&quot; appears in Canadian Margaret Atwood&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;.
* Počasíčko (diminutive of &quot;weather&quot;) was Czech TV Nova&#x27;s past-10PM featurette launched in January 1998 where a nude woman (or occasionally, a man) got dressed in clothing appropriate for the next day&#x27;s weather forecast. This was discontinued after several years and returned as web-only in February 2007. When Nova launched a new online portal in May 2008, it included a &quot;Red News&quot; section causing controversy; asked about the &quot;Naked News&quot;, they denied securing license and stressed Počasíčko&#x27;s primacy.
* In March 2010, students at the University of Cambridge presented a news segment on &quot;Cambridge University Television&quot; in the nude.
* French spoof news site &quot;Les Graves Infos&quot; (&quot;Serious News&quot;) was launched in mid-2009 with a stripping weather girl. The site closed in February 2010.
* In June 2014, a very similar show was released in Venezuela called &quot;Desnudando la Noticia&quot; (&quot;Stripping the News&quot;) which is a variant of &quot;Naked News&quot;.
* Playboy TV imitated the format with its news program &quot;The Daily Flash&quot;.
* In Portugal, a five-minute news bulletin fronted by a naked woman, titled &quot;Nutícias&quot;, premiered on 22 April 2002 on cable station SIC Radical. The show was canceled in 2003.
* A Finnish copy of the &quot;Naked News&quot; concept was broadcast on the country&#x27;s Aluetelevisio cable television channel. The show employed erotic actress Maria Kekkonen as a reporter. A former porn actress, Rakel Liekki, also worked for the show.

===Parodies===
* A 2005 episode of the satirical New Zealand news show &quot;Eating Media Lunch&quot; depicted newsreaders fornicating in a parody of &quot;Naked News&quot; called &quot;Fuck News&quot;.

<text>The Noble Eightfold Path () or Eight Right Paths () is an early summary of the path of Buddhist practices leading to liberation from samsara, the painful cycle of rebirth, in the form of nirvana.

The Eightfold Path consists of eight practices: right view, right resolve, right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right (&#x27;meditative absorption or union&#x27;; alternatively, equanimous meditative awareness).

In early Buddhism, these practices started with understanding that the body-mind works in a corrupted way (right view), followed by entering the Buddhist path of self-observance, self-restraint, and cultivating kindness and compassion; and culminating in or , which reinforces these practices for the development of the body-mind. In later Buddhism, insight () became the central soteriological instrument, leading to a different concept and structure of the path, in which the &quot;goal&quot; of the Buddhist path came to be specified as ending ignorance and rebirth.

The Noble Eightfold Path is one of the principal summaries of the Buddhist teachings, taught to lead to &quot;Arhatship&quot;. In the Theravada tradition, this path is also summarized as (morality), (meditation) and (insight). In Mahayana Buddhism, this path is contrasted with the Bodhisattva path, which is believed to go beyond &quot;Arhatship&quot; to full Buddhahood.

In Buddhist symbolism, the Noble Eightfold Path is often represented by means of the dharma wheel (), in which its eight spokes represent the eight elements of the path.

== Etymology and nomenclature ==
The Pali term (Sanskrit: ) is typically translated in English as &#x27;Noble Eightfold Path&#x27;. This translation is a convention started by the early translators of Buddhist texts into English, just like is translated as &#x27;Four Noble Truths&#x27;. However, the phrase does not mean the path is noble, rather that the path is (Pali: , meaning &#x27;enlightened, noble, precious people&#x27;). The term (Sanskrit: ) means &#x27;path&#x27;, while (Sanskrit: ) means &#x27;eightfold&#x27;. Thus, an alternate rendering of is &#x27;eightfold path of the noble ones&#x27;, or &#x27;Eightfold Ariya Path&#x27;.

All eight elements of the Path begin with the word (in Sanskrit) or (in Pāli) which means &#x27;right, proper, as it ought to be, best&#x27;. The Buddhist texts contrast with its opposite, .

The Noble Eightfold Path, in the Buddhist traditions, is the direct means to nirvana and brings a release from the cycle of life and death in the realms of samsara.

== The eight divisions ==
===Origins: the Middle Way===
According to Indologist Tilmann Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term &quot;the Middle Way&quot;. In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the Eightfold Path. Tilmann Vetter and historian Rod Bucknell both note that longer descriptions of &quot;the path&quot; can be found in the early texts, which can be condensed into the Eightfold Path.

=== Tenfold path ===
In the &quot;Mahācattārīsaka Sutta&quot; which appears in the Chinese and Pali canons, the Buddha explains that cultivation of the noble eightfold path of a learner leads to the development of two further paths of the Arahants, which are right knowledge, or insight (&quot;sammā-ñāṇa&quot;), and right liberation, or release (&quot;sammā-vimutti&quot;). These two factors fall under the category of wisdom (&quot;paññā&quot;).

===Short description of the eight divisions===
The eight Buddhist practices in the Noble Eightfold Path are:
# Right View: our actions have consequences, death is not the end, and our actions and beliefs have consequences after death. The Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and the other world (heaven and underworld/hell). Later on, right view came to explicitly include &quot;karma&quot; and rebirth, and the importance of the Four Noble Truths, when &quot;insight&quot; became central to Buddhist soteriology, especially in Theravada Buddhism.
# Right Resolve (&quot;samyaka-saṃkalpa&quot;/&quot;sammā-saṅkappa&quot;) can also be known as &quot;right thought&quot;, &quot;right aspiration&quot;, or &quot;right motivation&quot;. In this factor, the practitioner resolves to strive toward non-violence (&quot;ahimsa&quot;) and avoid violent and hateful conduct. It also includes the resolve to leave home, renounce the worldly life and follow the Buddhist path.
# Right Speech: no lying, no abusive speech, no divisive speech, no idle chatter.
# Right Conduct or Action: no killing or injuring, no taking what is not given, no sexual misconduct, no material desires. 
# Right Livelihood: no trading in weapons, living beings, meat, liquor, or poisons.
# Right Effort: preventing the arising of unwholesome states, and generating wholesome states, the &quot;bojjhaṅgā&quot; (Seven Factors of Awakening). This includes &quot;indriya-samvara&quot;, &quot;guarding the sense-doors&quot;, restraint of the sense faculties.
# Right Mindfulness (&quot;sati&quot;; &quot;Satipatthana&quot;; &quot;Sampajañña&quot;): a quality that guards or watches over the mind; the stronger it becomes, the weaker unwholesome states of mind become, weakening their power &quot;to take over and dominate thought, word and deed.&quot; In the vipassana movement, &quot;sati&quot; is interpreted as &quot;bare attention&quot;: never be absent minded, being conscious of what one is doing; this encourages the awareness of the impermanence of body, feeling and mind, as well as to experience the five aggregates (&quot;skandhas&quot;), the five hindrances, the four True Realities and seven factors of awakening.
# Right &quot;samadhi&quot; (&quot;passaddhi&quot;; &quot;ekaggata&quot;; &quot;sampasadana&quot;): practicing four stages of &quot;dhyāna&quot; (&quot;meditation&quot;), which includes &quot;samadhi&quot; proper in the second stage, and reinforces the development of the &quot;bojjhaṅgā&quot;, culminating into &quot;upekkhā&quot; (equanimity) and mindfulness. In the Theravada tradition and the vipassana movement, this is interpreted as &quot;ekaggata&quot;, concentration or one-pointedness of the mind, and supplemented with &quot;vipassana&quot; meditation, which aims at insight.

=== Right view ===
The purpose of &quot;right view&quot; (&#x27; / &#x27;) or &quot;right understanding&quot; is to clear one&#x27;s path from confusion, misunderstanding, and deluded thinking. It is a means to gain right understanding of reality.

====Sequences in the suttas====
The Pali canon and the Agamas contain various &quot;definitions&quot; or descriptions of &quot;right view.&quot; The &quot;Mahasatipatthana Sutta&quot; (Digha Nikaya 22), compiled from elements from other suttas possibly as late as 20 BCE, defines right view summarily as the Four Noble Truths: 
In this, right view explicitly includes &quot;karma&quot; and rebirth, and the importance of the Four Noble Truths. This view of &quot;right view&quot; gained importance when &quot;insight&quot; became central to Buddhist soteriology, and still plays an essential role in Theravada Buddhism.

Other suttas give a more extensive overview, stating that our actions have consequences, that death is not the end, that our actions and beliefs also have consequences after death, and that the Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and the other world (heaven and underworld or hell). The &quot;Mahācattārīsaka Sutta&quot; (&quot;The Great Forty,&quot; Majjhima Nikaya 117) gives an extensive overview, describing the first seven practices as requisites of right &quot;samadhi&quot; c.q. &quot;dhyana&quot;. It makes a distinction between mundane right view (&quot;karma&quot;, &quot;rebirth&quot;) and noble right view as a path-factor, relating noble right view to &quot;dhamma vicaya&quot; (&quot;investigation of principles), one of the &quot;bojjhanga&quot;, the &quot;seven factors of awakening&quot; which give an alternate account of right effort and &quot;dhyana&quot;.

Alternatively, right view (together with right resolve) is expressed in the stock phrase of &quot;dhammalsaddhalpabbajja&quot;: &quot;A layman hears a Buddha teach the Dhamma, comes to have faith in him, and decides to take ordination as a monk.&quot;
Likewise, the Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 9), and its parallel in the &quot;Samyukta-āgama&quot;, refer to faith in the Buddha and understanding (&quot;dhamma vicaya&quot;) the path-factors of wholesome bodily actions, verbal actions and mental actions.

==== Theravada ====
Right View can be further subdivided, states translator Bhikkhu Bodhi, into mundane right view and superior or supramundane right view:
# Mundane right view, knowledge of the fruits of good behavior (&quot;karma&quot;). Having this type of view will bring merit and will support the favourable rebirth of the sentient being in the realm of samsara.
# Supramundane (world-transcending) right view, the understanding of the Four Noble Truths, leading to awakening and liberation from rebirths and associated dukkha in the realms of samsara. According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, this kind of right view comes at the end of the path, not at the beginning.

According to Theravada Buddhism, mundane right view is a teaching that is suitable for lay followers, while supramundane right view, which requires a deeper understanding, is suitable for monastics. Mundane and supramundane right view involve accepting the following doctrines of Buddhism:
# Karma: Every action of body, speech, and mind has karmic results, and influences the kind of future rebirths and realms a being enters into.
# Three marks of existence: everything, whether physical or mental, is impermanent (&quot;anicca&quot;), a source of suffering (&quot;dukkha&quot;), and lacks a self (&quot;anatta&quot;).
# The Four Noble Truths are a means to gaining insights and ending &quot;dukkha&quot;.

====A-ditthi====
Gombrich notes that there is a tension in the suttas between &quot;right view&quot; and &#x27;no view&#x27;, release by not clinging to any view at all. According to Chryssides and Wilkins, &quot;right view is ultimately non-view: though the Enlightened One sees things as they really are, &#x27;he has a &quot;critical awareness&quot; of the impossibility of giving full and final expression to his conviction in fixed conceptual terms&#x27;. One therefore cannot cling to any particular formulation in a rigid and dogmatic manner.&quot;

=== Right resolve ===
Right Resolve (&quot;samyak-saṃkalpa&quot; / &quot;sammā-saṅkappa&quot;) can also be known as &quot;right thought&quot;, &quot;right aspiration&quot;, or &quot;right motivation&quot;. In this factor, the practitioner resolves to leave home, renounce the worldly life and dedicate himself to an ascetic pursuit. In section III.248, the Majjhima Nikaya states,
Like right view, this factor has two levels. At the mundane level, the resolve includes being harmless (ahimsa) and refraining from ill will (&quot;avyapadha&quot;) to any being, as this accrues karma and leads to rebirth. At the supramundane level, the factor includes a resolve to consider everything and everyone as impermanent, a source of suffering and without a Self.

=== Right speech ===

Right speech (&quot;samyag-vāc&quot; / &quot;sammā-vācā&quot;) in most Buddhist texts is presented as four abstentions, such as in the Pali Canon thus:
Instead of the usual &quot;abstention and refraining from wrong&quot; terminology, a few texts such as the Samaññaphala Sutta and Kevata Sutta in &quot;Digha Nikaya&quot; explain this virtue in an active sense, after stating it in the form of an abstention. For example, Samaññaphala Sutta states that a part of a monk&#x27;s virtue is that &quot;he abstains from false speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world.&quot; Similarly, the virtue of abstaining from divisive speech is explained as delighting in creating concord. The virtue of abstaining from abusive speech is explained in this Sutta to include affectionate and polite speech that is pleasing to people. The virtue of abstaining from idle chatter is explained as speaking what is connected with the Dhamma goal of his liberation.

In the &quot;Abhaya-raja-kumara Sutta&quot;, the Buddha explains the virtue of right speech in different scenarios, based on its truth value, utility value and emotive content. The &quot;Tathagata&quot;, states Abhaya Sutta, never speaks anything that is unfactual or factual, untrue or true, disagreeable or agreeable, if that is unbeneficial and unconnected to his goals. Further, adds Abhaya Sutta, the &quot;Tathagata&quot; speaks the factual, the true, if in case it is disagreeable and unendearing, only if it is beneficial to his goals, but with a sense of proper time. Additionally, adds Abhaya Sutta, the &quot;Tathagata&quot;, only speaks with a sense of proper time even when what he speaks is the factual, the true, the agreeable, the endearing and what is beneficial to his goals.

The Buddha thus explains right speech in the Pali Canon, according to Ganeri, as never speaking something that is not beneficial; and, only speaking what is true and beneficial, &quot;when the circumstances are right, whether they are welcome or not&quot;.

=== Right action ===
Right action (&quot;samyak-karmānta&quot; / &quot;sammā-kammanta&quot;) is like right speech, expressed as abstentions but in terms of bodily action. In the Pali Canon, this path factor is stated as:
The prohibition on killing precept in Buddhist scriptures applies to all living beings, states Christopher Gowans, not just human beings. Bhikkhu Bodhi agrees, clarifying that the more accurate rendering of the Pali canon is a prohibition on &quot;taking life of any sentient being&quot;, which includes human beings, animals, birds, insects but excludes plants because they are not considered sentient beings. Further, adds Bodhi, this precept refers to &quot;intentional&quot; killing, as well as any form of intentional harming or torturing any sentient being. This moral virtue in early Buddhist texts, both in context of harm or killing of animals and human beings, is similar to &quot;ahimsa&quot; precepts found in the texts particularly of Jainism as well as of Hinduism, and has been a subject of significant debate in various Buddhist traditions.

The prohibition on stealing in the Pali Canon is an abstention from intentionally taking what is not voluntarily offered by the person to whom that property belongs. This includes taking by stealth, by force, by fraud or by deceit. Both the intention and the act matters, as this precept is grounded on the impact on one&#x27;s karma.

The prohibition on sexual misconduct in the Noble Eightfold Path refers to &quot;not performing sexual acts&quot;. This virtue is more generically explained in the &quot;Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta&quot;, which teaches that one must abstain from all sensual misconduct, including getting sexually involved with someone unmarried (anyone protected by parents or by guardians or by siblings), and someone married (protected by husband), and someone betrothed to another person, and female convicts or by &quot;dhamma&quot;.

For monastics, the abstention from sensual misconduct means strict celibacy while for lay Buddhists this prohibits adultery as well as other forms of sensual misconduct. Later Buddhist texts state that the prohibition on sexual conduct for lay Buddhists includes any sexual involvement with someone married, a girl or woman protected by her parents or relatives, and someone prohibited by &quot;dhamma&quot; conventions (such as relatives, nuns and others).

=== Right livelihood ===
Right livelihood (&quot;samyag-ājīva&quot; / &quot;sammā-ājīva&quot;) precept is mentioned in many early Buddhist texts, such as the &quot;Mahācattārīsaka Sutta&quot; in &quot;Majjhima Nikaya&quot; as follows:
The early canonical texts state right livelihood as avoiding and abstaining from wrong livelihood. This virtue is further explained in Buddhist texts, states Vetter, as &quot;living from begging, but not accepting everything and not possessing more than is strictly necessary&quot;. For lay Buddhists, this precept requires that the livelihood avoid causing suffering to sentient beings by cheating them, or harming or killing them in any way.

The Anguttara Nikaya III.208 asserts that the right livelihood does not trade in weapons, living beings, meat, alcoholic drink or poison. The same text, in section V.177, asserts that this applies to lay Buddhists. This has meant, states Harvey, that raising and trading cattle livestock for slaughter is a breach of &quot;right livelihood&quot; precept in the Buddhist tradition, and Buddhist countries lack the mass slaughter houses found in Western countries.

=== Right effort ===
Right effort (&quot;samyag-vyāyāma&quot; / &quot;sammā-vāyāma&quot;) is preventing the arising of unwholesome states, and the generation of wholesome states. This includes &quot;indriya-samvara&quot;, &quot;guarding the sense-doors&quot;, restraint of the sense faculties. Right effort is presented in the Pali Canon, such as the &quot;Sacca-vibhanga Sutta&quot;, as follows:
The unwholesome states (&quot;akusala&quot;) are described in the Buddhist texts are related to thoughts, emotions, intentions. These include the &quot;pancanivarana&quot; (five hindrances), that is, sensual thoughts, doubts about the path, restlessness, drowsiness, and ill will of any kind. Of these, the Buddhist traditions consider sensual thoughts and ill will needing more right effort. Sensual desire that must be eliminated by effort includes anything related to sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch. This is to be done by restraint of the sense faculties (&quot;indriya-samvara&quot;). Ill will that must be eliminated by effort includes any form of aversion including hatred, anger, resentment towards anything or anyone.

=== Right mindfulness ===

While originally, in Yogic practice, &quot;sati&quot; may have meant to remember the meditation object, to cultivate a deeply absorbed, secluded state of mind, in the oldest Buddhism it has the meaning of &quot;retention&quot;, being mindful of the &quot;dhammas&quot; (both wholesome states of mind, and teachings and practices that remind of those wholesome states of mind) that are beneficial to the Buddhist path. According to Gethin, &quot;sati&quot; is a quality that guards or watches over the mind; the stronger it becomes, the weaker unwholesome states of mind become, weakening their power &quot;to take over and dominate thought, word and deed.&quot; According to Frauwallner, mindfulness was a means to prevent the arising of craving, which resulted simply from contact between the senses and their objects. According to Frauwallner this may have been the Buddha&#x27;s original idea. According to Trainor, mindfulness aids one not to crave and cling to any transitory state or thing, by complete and constant awareness of phenomena as impermanent, suffering and without self. Gethin refers to the &quot;Milindapanha&quot;, which states that &quot;sati&quot; brings to mind the &quot;dhammas&quot; and their beneficial or unbeneficial qualities, aiding the removal of unbeneficial dhammas and the strengthening of beneficial dhammas. Gethin further notes that &quot;sati&quot; makes one aware of the &quot;full range and extent of &quot;dhammas&quot;&quot;, that is, the relation between things, broadening one&#x27;s view and understanding.

The &quot;Satipatthana Sutta&quot; describes the contemplation of four domains, namely body, feelings, mind and phenomena. The &quot;Satipatthana Sutta&quot; is regarded by the vipassana movement as the quintessential text on Buddhist meditation, taking cues from it on &quot;bare attention&quot; and the contemplation on the observed phenomena as &quot;dukkha&quot;, &quot;anatta&quot; and &quot;anicca&quot;. According to Grzegorz Polak, the four &quot;upassanā&quot; have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four &quot;upassanā&quot; do not refer to four different foundations of which one should be aware, but are an alternate description of the &quot;jhanas&quot;, describing how the &quot;samskharas&quot; are tranquilized:
* the six sense-bases which one needs to be aware of (&quot;kāyānupassanā&quot;); 
* contemplation on vedanās, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (&quot;vedanānupassanā&quot;);
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (&quot;cittānupassanā&quot;);
* the development from the five hindrances to the seven factors of enlightenment (&quot;dhammānupassanā&quot;).

In the vipassana movement, mindfulness (&quot;&quot; / &quot;sammā-sati&quot;) is interpreted as &quot;bare attention&quot;: never be absent minded, being conscious of what one is doing. Rupert Gethin notes that the contemporary vipassana movement interprets the &quot;Satipatthana Sutta&quot; as &quot;describing a pure form of insight (&quot;vipassanā&quot;) meditation&quot; for which &quot;samatha&quot; (calm) and &quot;dhyāna&quot; are not necessary. Yet, in pre-sectarian Buddhism, the establishment of mindfulness was placed before the practice of the &quot;Dhyāna&quot;, and associated with the abandonment of the five hindrances and the entry into the first &quot;Dhyāna&quot;. 

The &quot;dhyāna&quot;-scheme describes mindfulness also as appearing in the third and fourth &quot;dhyāna&quot;, after initial concentration of the mind. Gombrich and Wynne note that, while the second &quot;dhyāna&quot; denotes a state of absorption, in the third and fourth &quot;dhyāna&quot; one comes out of this absorption, being mindfully aware of objects while being indifferent to them. According to Gombrich, &quot;the later tradition has falsified the jhana by classifying them as the quintessence of the concentrated, calming kind of meditation, ignoring the other – and indeed higher – element&quot;.

=== Right samadhi (unification of mind)===
====&quot;Samadhi&quot;====
&quot;Samadhi&quot; (&quot;samyak-samādhi&quot; / &quot;sammā-samādhi&quot;) is a common practice or goal in Indian religions. The term &quot;samadhi&quot; derives from the root sam-a-dha, which means &#x27;to collect&#x27; or &#x27;bring together&#x27;, and thus it is often translated as &#x27;concentration&#x27; or &#x27;unification of mind&#x27;. In the early Buddhist texts, samadhi is also associated with the term &quot;samatha&quot; (calm abiding).

====Dhyana====
Bronkhorst notes that neither the Four Noble Truths nor the Noble Eightfold Path discourse provide details of right &quot;samadhi&quot;. Several &quot;Suttas&quot;, such as the following in &quot;Saccavibhanga Sutta&quot;, equate it with &quot;dhyana&quot;:

Bronkhorst has questioned the historicity and chronology of the description of the four &quot;jhanas&quot;. Bronkhorst states that this path may be similar to what the Buddha taught, but the details and the form of the description of the &quot;jhanas&quot; in particular, and possibly other factors, is likely the work of later scholasticism. Bronkhorst notes that description of the third &quot;jhana&quot; cannot have been formulated by the Buddha, since it includes the phrase &quot;Noble Ones say&quot;, quoting earlier Buddhists, indicating it was formulated by later Buddhists. It is likely that later Buddhist scholars incorporated this, then attributed the details and the path, particularly the insights at the time of liberation, to have been discovered by the Buddha.

====Concentration====
In the Theravada tradition, &quot;samadhi&quot; is interpreted as concentration on a meditation object. Buddhagosa defines samadhi as &quot;the centering of consciousness and consciousness concomitants evenly and rightly on a single object...the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object, undistracted and unscattered.&quot;

According to Henepola Gunaratana, in the suttas samadhi is defined as one-pointedness of mind (&quot;Cittass&#x27;ekaggatā&quot;). According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the right concentration factor is reaching a one-pointedness of mind and unifying all mental factors, but it is not the same as &quot;a gourmet sitting down to a meal, or a soldier on the battlefield&quot; who also experience one-pointed concentration. The difference is that the latter have a one-pointed object in focus with complete awareness directed to that object – the meal or the target, respectively. In contrast, right concentration meditative factor in Buddhism is a state of awareness without any object or subject, and ultimately unto no-thingness and emptiness, as articulated in apophatic discourse. 

====Development into equanimity====
Although often translated as &quot;concentration&quot;, as in the limiting of the attention of the mind on one object, in the fourth &quot;dhyana&quot; &quot;equanimity and mindfulness remain&quot;, and the practice of concentration-meditation may well have been incorporated from non-Buddhist traditions. Vetter notes that &quot;samadhi&quot; consists of the four stages of awakening, but
Gombrich and Wynne note that, while the second &quot;jhana&quot; denotes a state of absorption, in the third and fourth &quot;jhana&quot; one comes out of this absorption, being mindfully awareness of objects while being indifferent to it. According to Gombrich, &quot;the later tradition has falsified the jhana by classifying them as the quintessence of the concentrated, calming kind of meditation, ignoring the other – and indeed higher – element.&quot;

=== Liberation ===
Following the Noble Eightfold Path leads to liberation in the form of nirvana:
== Practice ==

=== Order of practice ===
Vetter notes that originally the path culminated in the practice of &quot;dhyana/samadhi&quot; as the core soteriological practice. According to the Pali and Chinese canon, the &quot;samadhi&quot; state (right concentration) is dependent on the development of preceding path factors:
According to the discourses, right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness are used as the support and requisite conditions for the practice of right concentration. Understanding of the right view is the preliminary role, and is also the forerunner of the entire Noble Eightfold Path.

According to the modern Theravada monk and scholar Walpola Rahula, the divisions of the noble eightfold path &quot;are to be developed more or less simultaneously, as far as possible according to the capacity of each individual. They are all linked together and each helps the cultivation of the others.&quot; Bhikkhu Bodhi explains that these factors are not sequential, but components, and &quot;with a certain degree of progress all eight factors can be present simultaneously, each supporting the others. However, until that point is reached, some sequence in the unfolding of the path is inevitable.&quot;

The stage in the Path where there is no more learning in Yogachara Abhidharma, state Buswell and Gimello, is identical to &quot;Nirvana&quot; or &quot;Buddhahood&quot;, the ultimate goal in Buddhism.

=== Sila-samadhi-prajna ===
The Noble Eightfold Path is sometimes divided into three basic divisions, with right view and right resolve concluding the sequence:
This order is a later development, when discriminating insight (&quot;prajna&quot;) became central to Buddhist soteriology, and came to be regarded as the culmination of the Buddhist path. Yet, Majjhima Nikaya 117, &quot;Mahācattārīsaka Sutta&quot;, describes the first seven practices as requisites for right samadhi. According to Vetter, this may have been the original soteriological practice in early Buddhism.

The &quot;moral virtues&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;śīla&quot;, Pāli: &quot;sīla&quot;) group consists of three paths: right speech, right action and right livelihood. The word &quot;sīla&quot;, though translated by English writers as linked to &quot;morals or ethics&quot;, states Bhikkhu Bodhi, is in ancient and medieval Buddhist commentary tradition closer to the concept of discipline and disposition that &quot;leads to harmony at several levels – social, psychological, karmic and contemplative&quot;. Such harmony creates an environment to pursue the meditative steps in the Noble Eightfold Path by reducing social disorder, preventing inner conflict that result from transgressions, favoring future karma-triggered movement through better rebirths, and purifying the mind.

The meditation group (&quot;samadhi&quot;) of the path progresses from moral restraints to training the mind. Right effort and mindfulness calm the mind-body complex, releasing unwholesome states and habitual patterns and encouraging the development of wholesome states and non-automatic responses, the &quot;bojjhaṅga&quot; (seven factors of awakening). The practice of &quot;dhyāna&quot; reinforces these developments, leading to &quot;upekkhā&quot; (equanimity) and mindfulness. According to the Theravada commentarial tradition and the contemporary vipassana movement, the goal in this group of the Noble Eightfold Path is to develop clarity and insight into the nature of reality – &quot;dukkha&quot;, &quot;anicca&quot; and &quot;anatta&quot;, discard negative states and dispel &quot;avidya&quot; (ignorance), ultimately attaining &quot;nirvana&quot;.

In the threefold division, &quot;prajna&quot; (insight, wisdom) is presented as the culmination of the path, whereas in the eightfold division the path starts with correct knowledge or insight, which is needed to understand why this path should be followed.

==Schools of Buddhism and their views of the Eightfold Path==
===Theravada presentations of the path===
Theravada Buddhism is a diverse tradition and thus includes different explanations of the path to awakening. However, the teachings of the Buddha are often encapsulated by Theravadins in the basic framework of the Four Noble Truths and the Eighthfold Path.

Some Theravada Buddhists also follow the presentation of the path laid out in Buddhaghosa&#x27;s Visuddhimagga. This presentation is known as the &quot;Seven Purifications&quot; (&quot;satta-visuddhi&quot;). This schema and its accompanying outline of &quot;insight knowledges&quot; (&quot;vipassanā-ñāṇa&quot;) is used by modern influential Theravadin scholars, such Mahasi Sayadaw (in his &quot;The Progress of Insight&quot;) and Nyanatiloka Thera (in &quot;The Buddha&#x27;s Path to Deliverance&quot;).

===Mahayana presentations of the path===
Mahāyāna Buddhism is based principally upon the path of a Bodhisattva. A &quot;Bodhisattva&quot; refers to one who is on the path to buddhahood. The term &quot;Mahāyāna&quot; was originally a synonym for &quot;Bodhisattvayāna&quot; or &quot;Bodhisattva Vehicle&quot;.

In the earliest texts of Mahāyāna Buddhism, the path of a bodhisattva was to awaken the &quot;bodhicitta&quot;. Between the 1st and 3rd century CE, this tradition introduced the &quot;Ten Bhumi&quot; doctrine, which means ten levels or stages of awakening. This development was followed by the acceptance that it is impossible to achieve Buddhahood in one (current) lifetime, and the best goal is not nirvana for oneself, but Buddhahood after climbing through the ten levels during multiple rebirths. Mahāyāna scholars then outlined an elaborate path, for monks and laypeople, and the path includes the vow to help teach Buddhist knowledge to other beings, so as to help them cross samsara and liberate themselves, once one reaches the Buddhahood in a future rebirth. One part of this path are the &quot;pāramitā&quot; (perfections, to cross over), derived from the &quot;Jatakas&quot; tales of Buddha&#x27;s numerous rebirths.

The doctrine of the bodhisattva bhūmis was also eventually merged with the Sarvāstivāda Vaibhāṣika schema of the &quot;five paths&quot; by the Yogacara school&quot;.&quot; This Mahāyāna &quot;five paths&quot; presentation can be seen in Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot;.

The Mahāyāna texts are inconsistent in their discussion of the &quot;pāramitās&quot;, and some texts include lists of two, others four, six, ten and fifty-two. The six paramitas have been most studied, and these are:

# &quot;Dāna pāramitā&quot;: perfection of giving; primarily to monks, nuns and the Buddhist monastic establishment dependent on the alms and gifts of the lay householders, in return for generating religious merit; some texts recommend ritually transferring the merit so accumulated for better rebirth to someone else
# &quot;Śīla pāramitā&quot;: perfection of morality; it outlines ethical behaviour for both the laity and the Mahayana monastic community; this list is similar to Śīla in the Eightfold Path (i.e. Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood)
# &quot; pāramitā&quot;: perfection of patience, willingness to endure hardship
# &quot;Vīrya pāramitā&quot;: perfection of vigour; this is similar to Right Effort in the Eightfold Path
# &quot;Dhyāna pāramitā&quot;: perfection of meditation; this is similar to Right Concentration in the Eightfold Path
# &quot;Prajñā pāramitā&quot;: perfection of insight (wisdom), awakening to the characteristics of existence such as karma, rebirths, impermanence, no-self, dependent origination and emptiness; this is complete acceptance of the Buddha teaching, then conviction, followed by ultimate realisation that &quot;dharmas are non-arising&quot;.

In Mahāyāna Sutras that include ten &quot;pāramitā&quot;, the additional four perfections are &quot;skillful means, vow, power and knowledge&quot;. The most discussed &quot;pāramitā&quot; and the highest rated perfection in Mahayana texts is the &quot;Prajna-paramita&quot;, or the &quot;perfection of insight&quot;. This insight in the Mahāyāna tradition, states Shōhei Ichimura, has been the &quot;insight of non-duality or the absence of reality in all things&quot;.

====East Asian Buddhism====

East Asian Buddhism is influenced by both the classic Indian Buddhist presentations of the path such as the Eightfold Path as well as classic Indian Mahāyāna presentations such as that found in the Da zhidu lun.

There are many different presentations of soteriology, including numerous paths and vehicles (&quot;yanas&quot;) in the different traditions of East Asian Buddhism. There is no single dominant presentation. In Zen Buddhism for example, one can find outlines of the path such as the Two Entrances and Four Practices&quot;,&quot; The Five ranks, The Ten Ox-Herding Pictures and The Three mysterious Gates of Linji.

====Indo-Tibetan Buddhism====
In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, the path to liberation is outlined in the genre known as Lamrim (&quot;Stages of the Path&quot;). All the various Tibetan schools have their own Lamrim presentations. This genre can be traced to Atiśa&#x27;s 11th-century &quot;A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment&quot; (&quot;Bodhipathapradīpa&quot;).

== Cognitive psychology ==
The noble eightfold path has been compared to cognitive psychology; Gil Fronsdal says the right view factor can be interpreted to mean how one&#x27;s mind views the world, and how that leads to patterns of thought, intention and actions. In contrast, Peter Randall states that it is the seventh factor or right mindfulness that may be thought in terms of cognitive psychology, wherein the change in thought and behavior are linked.

<text>A national park is a nature park designated for conservation purposes because of unparalleled national natural, historic, or cultural significance. It is an area of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that is protected and owned by a government. Although governments hold different standards for national park designation, the conservation of &#x27;wild nature&#x27; for posterity and as a symbol of national pride is a common motivation for the continued protection of all national parks around the world. National parks are almost always accessible to the public. Usually national parks are developed, owned and managed by national governments, though in some countries with federal or devolved forms of government, &quot;national parks&quot; may be the responsibility of subnational, regional, or local authorities.

The United States established Yellowstone National Park, the first &quot;public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people,&quot; in 1872. Although Yellowstone was not officially termed a &quot;national park&quot; at the time, in practice it is widely held to be the first and oldest national park in the world. The Tobago Main Ridge Forest Reserve (in what is now Trinidad and Tobago; established in 1776) and the area surrounding Bogd Khan Uul Mountain (Mongolia, 1778), which were restricted from cultivation to protect surrounding farmland, are considered the oldest legally protected areas. Parks Canada, established on May 19, 1911, is the world&#x27;s oldest national park service. 

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and its World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) have defined &quot;National Park&quot; as its &quot;Category II&quot; type of protected areas. According to the IUCN, 6,555 national parks worldwide met its criteria in 2006. IUCN is still discussing the parameters of defining a national park.

The largest national park in the world meeting the IUCN definition is the Northeast Greenland National Park, which was established in 1974 and is in area.

==Definitions==


In 1969, the IUCN declared a national park to be a relatively large area with the following defining characteristics:

* One or several ecosystems not materially altered by human exploitation and occupation, where plant and animal species, geomorphological sites and habitats are of special scientific, educational, and recreational interest or which contain a natural landscape of great beauty;
* Highest competent authority of the country has taken steps to prevent or eliminate exploitation or occupation as soon as possible in the whole area and to effectively enforce the respect of ecological, geomorphological, or aesthetic features which have led to its establishment; and
* Visitors are allowed to enter, under special conditions, for inspirational, educative, cultural, and recreative purposes.

In 1971, these criteria were further expanded upon leading to more clear and defined benchmarks to evaluate a national park. These include:

* Minimum size of 1,000 hectares within zones in which protection of nature takes precedence
* Statutory legal protection
* Budget and staff sufficient to provide effective protection
* Prohibition of exploitation of natural resources (including the development of dams) qualified by such activities as sport, hunting, fishing, the need for management, facilities, etc.

While the term national park is now defined by the IUCN, many protected areas in many countries are called national park even when they correspond to other categories of the IUCN Protected Area Management Definition, for example:
* Swiss National Park, Switzerland: IUCN Ia – Strict Nature Reserve
* Everglades National Park, United States: IUCN Ib – Wilderness Area
* Koli National Park, Finland: IUCN II – Surface Area
* Victoria Falls National Park, Zimbabwe: IUCN III – National Monument
* Vitosha National Park, Bulgaria: IUCN IV – Habitat Management Area
* New Forest National Park, United Kingdom: IUCN V – Protected Landscape
* Etniko Ygrotopiko Parko Delta Evrou, Greece: IUCN VI – Managed Resource Protected Area

While national parks are generally understood to be administered by national governments (hence the name), in Australia, with the exception of six national parks, national parks are run by state governments and predate the Federation of Australia; similarly, national parks in the Netherlands are administered by the provinces. In Canada, there are both national parks operated by the federal government and provincial or territorial parks operated by the provincial and territorial governments, although nearly all are still national parks by the IUCN definition.

In many countries, including Indonesia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, national parks do not adhere to the IUCN definition, while some areas which adhere to the IUCN definition are not designated as national parks.

===Terminology===

As many countries do not adhere to the IUCN definition, the term &quot;national park&quot; may be used loosely. In the United Kingdom, and in some other countries such as Taiwan, a &quot;national park&quot; simply describes a general area that is relatively undeveloped, scenic, and attracts tourists, with some form of planning restrictions to ensure it maintains those characteristics. There may be substantial human settlements within the bounds of a national park. 

Conversely, parks that meet the criteria may be not be referred to as &quot;national parks&quot;. Terms like &quot;preserve&quot; or &quot;reserve&quot; may be used instead.

==History==
===Early references===
Starting in 1735 the Naples government undertook laws to protect Natural areas, which could be used as a game reserve by the royal family; Procida was the first protected site; the difference between the many previous royal hunting preserves and this one, which is considered to be closer to a Park rather than a hunting preserve, is that Neapolitan government already considered the division into the present-day wilderness areas and non-strict nature reserves.

In 1810, the English poet William Wordsworth described the Lake District as a &quot;sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy.&quot; The painter George Catlin, in his travels through the American West, wrote during the 1830s that Native Americans in the United States might be preserved &quot;(by some great protecting policy of government) ... in a &quot;magnificent park&quot; ... A &quot;nation&#x27;s Park&quot;, containing man and beast, in all the wild and freshness of their nature&#x27;s beauty!&quot;

===First efforts: Hot Springs, Arkansas and Yosemite Valley===

The first effort by the U.S. Federal government to set aside such protected lands was on 20 April 1832, when President Andrew Jackson signed legislation that the 22nd United States Congress had enacted to set aside four sections of land around what is now Hot Springs, Arkansas, to protect the natural, thermal springs and adjoining mountainsides for the future disposal of the U.S. government. It was known as Hot Springs Reservation, but no legal authority was established. Federal control of the area was not clearly established until 1877. The work of important leaders who fought for animal and land conservation were essential in the development of legal action. Some of these leaders include President Abraham Lincoln, Laurance Rockefeller, President Theodore Roosevelt, John Muir, and First Lady Lady Bird Johnson to name a few.

John Muir is today referred to as the &quot;Father of the National Parks&quot; due to his work in Yosemite. He published two influential articles in The Century Magazine, which formed the base for the subsequent legislation.

President Abraham Lincoln signed an Act of Congress on 1 July 1864, ceding the Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias (later becoming Yosemite National Park) to the state of California. According to this bill, private ownership of the land in this area was no longer possible. The state of California was designated to manage the park for &quot;public use, resort, and recreation&quot;. Leases were permitted for up to ten years and the proceeds were to be used for conservation and improvement. A public discussion followed this first legislation of its kind and there was a heated debate over whether the government had the right to create parks. The perceived mismanagement of Yosemite by the Californian state was the reason why Yellowstone was put under national control at its establishment six years later.

===First national park: Yellowstone===
In 1872, Yellowstone National Park was established as the United States&#x27; first national park, being also the world&#x27;s first national park. In some European and Asian countries, however, national protection and nature reserves already existed - though typically as game reserves and recreational grounds set aside for royalty, such as a part of the Forest of Fontainebleau (France, 1861).

Yellowstone was part of a federally governed territory. With no state government that could assume stewardship of the land, the federal government took on direct responsibility for the park, the official first national park of the United States. The combined effort and interest of conservationists, politicians and the Northern Pacific Railroad ensured the passage of enabling legislation by the United States Congress to create Yellowstone National Park. Theodore Roosevelt and his group of conservationists, the Boone and Crockett Club, were active campaigners and were highly influential in convincing fellow Republicans and big business to back the bill. Yellowstone National Park soon played a pivotal role in the conservation of these national treasures, as it was suffering at the hands of poachers and others who stood at the ready to pillage what they could from the area. Theodore Roosevelt and his newly formed Boone and Crockett Club successfully took the lead in protecting Yellowstone National Park from this plight, resulting in laws designed to conserve the natural resources in Yellowstone and other parks under the Government&#x27;s purview.

American Pulitzer Prize-winning author Wallace Stegner wrote: &quot;National parks are the best idea we ever had. Absolutely American, absolutely democratic, they reflect us at our best rather than our worst.&quot;

===International growth of national parks===
The first area to use &quot;national park&quot; in its creation legislation was the U.S.&#x27;s Mackinac National Park, in 1875. (The area was later transferred to the state&#x27;s authority in 1895, thus losing its official &quot;national park&quot; status.)

Following the idea established in Yellowstone and Mackinac, there soon followed parks in other nations. In Australia, what is now Royal National Park was established just south of Sydney, Colony of New South Wales, on 26 April 1879, becoming the world&#x27;s second official national park. Since Mackinac lost its national park status, the Royal National Park is, by some considerations, the second oldest national park now in existence.

Banff National Park became Canada&#x27;s first national park in 1885. New Zealand established Tongariro National Park in 1887.

In Europe, the first national parks were a set of nine parks in Sweden in 1909, followed by the Swiss National Park in 1914. Africa&#x27;s first national park was established in 1925 when Albert I of Belgium designated an area of what is now Democratic Republic of Congo centred on the Virunga Mountains as the Albert National Park (since renamed Virunga National Park).

In 1895, the Groenkloof Nature Reserve was established as the first game sanctuary in Africa. In 1926, the government of South Africa designated Kruger National Park as the nation&#x27;s first national park, although it was an expansion of the earlier Sabie Game Reserve established in 1898 by President Paul Kruger of the old South African Republic, after whom the park was named.

Argentina became the third country in the Americas to create a national park system, with the creation of the Nahuel Huapi National Park in 1934, through the initiative of Francisco Moreno.

After World War II, national parks were founded all over the world. The United Kingdom designated its first national park, Peak District National Park, in 1951. This followed perhaps 70 years of pressure for greater public access to the landscape. By the end of the decade a further nine national parks had been designated in the UK. Europe has some 359 national parks as of 2010. The Vanoise National Park in the Alps was the first French national park, created in 1963 after public mobilization against a touristic project.

In 1971, Lahemaa National Park in Estonia was the first area to be designated a national park in the former Soviet Union.

In 1973, Mount Kilimanjaro was classified as a National Park and was opened to public access in 1977.

In 1989, the Qomolangma National Nature Preserve (QNNP) was created to protect 3.381 million hectares on the north slope of Mount Everest in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. This national park is the first major global park to have no separate warden and protection staff—all of its management consists of existing local authorities, allowing a lower cost basis and a larger geographical coverage (in 1989 when created, it was the largest protected area in Asia). It includes four of the six tallest mountains in the world: Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Cho Oyu. The QNNP is contiguous to four Nepali national parks, creating a transnational conservation area equal in size to Switzerland.

In 1993, the Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park was established in Jamaica to conserve and protect 41,198 hectares, including tropical montane rainforest and adjacent buffer areas. The site includes Jamaica&#x27;s tallest peak (Blue Mountain Peak), hiking trails and a visitor center. The Park was also designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015.

===National parks services===
The world&#x27;s first national park service was established May 19, 1911, in Canada. The &quot;Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act&quot; placed the dominion parks under the administration of the Dominion Park Branch (now Parks Canada), within the Department of the Interior. The branch was established to &quot;protect sites of natural wonder&quot; to provide a recreational experience, centred on the idea of the natural world providing rest and spiritual renewal from the urban setting. Canada now has the largest protected area in the world with 450,000 km2 of national park space.

Even with the creation of Yellowstone, Yosemite, and nearly 37 other national parks and monuments, another 44 years passed before an agency was created in the United States to administer these units in a comprehensive way – the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The 64th United States Congress passed the National Park Service Organic Act, which President Woodrow Wilson signed into law on 25 August 1916. Of the sites managed by the National Park Service of the United States, only 63 carry the designation of National Park.
==Economic ramifications==
Countries with a large ecotourism industry, such as Costa Rica, often experience a huge economic effect on park management as well as the economy of the country as a whole.

===Tourism===

Tourism to national parks has increased considerably over time. In Costa Rica for example, a megadiverse country, tourism to parks has increased by 400% from 1985 to 1999. The term &quot;national park&quot; is perceived as a brand name that is associated with nature-based tourism and it symbolizes a &quot;high quality natural environment with a well-designed tourist infrastructure&quot;.

===Staff===
The duties of a park ranger are to supervise, manage, and/or perform work in the conservation and use of park resources. This involves functions such as park conservation; natural, historical, and cultural resource management; and the development and operation of interpretive and recreational programs for the benefit of the visiting public. Park rangers also have fire fighting responsibilities and execute search and rescue missions. Activities also include heritage interpretation to disseminate information to visitors of general, historical, or scientific information. Management of resources such as wildlife, lake shores, seashores, forests, historic buildings, battlefields, archaeological properties, and recreation areas are also part of the job of a park ranger. Since the establishment of the National Park Service in the US in 1916, the role of the park ranger has shifted from merely being a custodian of natural resources to include several activities that are associated with law enforcement. They control traffic, manage permits for various uses, and investigate violations, complaints, trespass/encroachment, and accidents.

== Concerns ==
National parks in former European colonies have come under criticism for allegedly perpetuating colonialism. National parks were created by individuals who felt that pristine, natural sections of nature should be set aside and preserved from urban development. In America, this movement came about during the American frontier and were meant to be monuments to America&#x27;s true history. Yet, in some instances, the lands that were to be set aside and protected in formerly colonized lands were already being inhabited by native communities, who were then removed off of these lands to create pristine sites for public consumption. Critics claim that the removal of people from national parks enhances the belief that nature can only be protected when humans do not exist within it, and that this leads to perpetuating the dichotomy between nature and humans (also known as the nature–culture divide). They see the creation of national parks as a form of eco-land grabbing. Others claim that traveling to national parks to appreciate nature there leads people to ignore the nature that exists around them every day. Still others argue that tourism can actually negatively impact the areas that are being visited.

<doc id="21819" wikidata="Q157037" url="?curid=21819" title="Nuncio">
<text>An apostolic nuncio (; also known as a papal nuncio or simply as a nuncio) is an ecclesiastical diplomat, serving as an envoy or a permanent diplomatic representative of the Holy See to a state or to an international organization. A nuncio is appointed by and represents the Holy See, and is the head of the diplomatic mission, called an apostolic nunciature, which is the equivalent of an embassy. The Holy See is legally distinct from the Vatican City or the Catholic Church. In modern times, a nuncio is usually an archbishop.

An apostolic nuncio is generally equivalent in rank to that of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, although in Catholic countries the nuncio often ranks above ambassadors in diplomatic protocol. A nuncio performs the same functions as an ambassador and has the same diplomatic privileges. Under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, to which the Holy See is a party, a nuncio is an ambassador like those from any other country. The Vienna Convention allows the host state to grant seniority of precedence to the nuncio over others of ambassadorial rank accredited to the same country, and may grant the deanship of that country&#x27;s diplomatic corps to the nuncio regardless of seniority. The representative of the Holy See in some situations is called a Delegate or, in the case of the United Nations, Permanent Observer. In the Holy See hierarchy, these usually rank equally to a nuncio, but they do not have formal diplomatic status, though in some countries they have some diplomatic privileges.

In addition, the nuncio serves as the liaison between the Holy See and the Church in that particular nation, supervising the diocesan episcopate (usually a national or multinational conference of bishops which has its own chairman, elected by its members). The nuncio has an important role in the selection of bishops.

== Terminology and history ==

The name &quot;nuncio&quot; derived from the ancient Latin word &quot;nuntius&quot;, meaning &quot;envoy&quot; or &quot;messenger&quot;. Since such envoys are accredited to the Holy See as such and not to the State of Vatican City, the term &quot;nuncio&quot; (versus &quot;ambassador&quot;) emphasizes the unique nature of the diplomatic mission. The 1983 Code of Canon Law claims the &quot;innate right&quot; to send and receive delegates independent from interference of non-ecclesiastical civil power. Canon law only recognizes international law limitations on this right.

Formerly, the title Apostolic Internuncio denoted a papal diplomatic representative of the second class, corresponding to Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary as a title for diplomatic representatives of states (cf. Article 14, par. 2 of the Vienna Convention). Before 1829, Internuncio was the title applied to the &quot;ad interim&quot; head of a mission when one nuncio had left office and his replacement had not yet assumed it.

A legate a latere is a temporary papal representative or a representative for a special purpose.

Historically, the most important type of apocrisiary (a title also applying to representatives exchanged by a high prelate with a patriarch) was the equivalent of a nuncio, sent by the pope to the Byzantine Empire; during the fifth and sixth centuries, when much of Italy remained under Byzantine control, several popes were former apocrisiaries.

Pro-nuncio was a term used from 1965 to 1991 for a papal diplomatic representative of full ambassadorial rank accredited to a country that did not accord him precedence over other ambassadors and &quot;de jure&quot; deanship of the diplomatic corps. In those countries, the papal representative&#x27;s precedence within the corps is no different from that of the other members of ambassadorial rank, so that he becomes dean only on becoming the senior member of the corps.

In countries with whom the Holy See does not have diplomatic ties, an apostolic delegate may be sent to act as a liaison with the Roman Catholic Church in that country, though not accredited to its government. Apostolic delegates have the same ecclesiastical rank as nuncios, but have no formal diplomatic status, though in some countries they have some diplomatic privileges. For example, an apostolic delegate served as the Holy See&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; diplomatic representative to the United States and the United Kingdom, until both major Anglo-Saxon states with a predominantly Protestant tradition established full-fledged relations with the Holy See in the late twentieth century, allowing for the appointment of a papal nuncio (see the list of British ambassadors to the Holy See). Archbishop Pio Laghi, for example, was first apostolic delegate, then pro-nuncio, to the United States during the Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush presidencies.

Apostolic delegates are also sent to regions such as the West Indies and the islands of the Pacific. These delegates are also appointed nuncio to at least some of the many states covered by their delegation, but the area entrusted to them also contains one or more territories that either are not independent states or are states that do not have diplomatic relations with the Holy See.

Article 16 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations provides:
# Heads of mission shall take precedence in their respective classes in the order of the date and time of taking up their functions in accordance with Article 13.
# Alterations in the credentials of a head of mission not involving any change of class shall not affect his precedence.
# This article is without prejudice to any practice accepted by the receiving State regarding the precedence of the representative of the Holy See.

In accordance with this article, many states (even not predominantly Catholic ones such as Germany and Switzerland and including the great majority in central and western Europe and in the Americas) give precedence to the nuncio over other diplomatic representatives, according him the position of Dean of the Diplomatic Corps reserved in other countries for the longest-serving resident ambassador.

== Multilateral ==
Holy See representatives called permanent observers are accredited to several international organisations, including offices or agencies of the United Nations, and other organizations either specialized in their mission or regional or both. A permanent observer of the Holy See is always a cleric, often a titular archbishop with the rank of nuncio, but there has been considerable variation between offices and over time.

<doc id="21820" wikidata="Q557532" url="?curid=21820" title="Newlyn School">
<text>The Newlyn School was an art colony of artists based in or near Newlyn, a fishing village adjacent to Penzance, on the south coast of Cornwall, from the 1880s until the early twentieth century. The establishment of the Newlyn School was reminiscent of the Barbizon School in France, where artists fled Paris to paint in a more pure setting emphasising natural light. These schools along with a related California movement were also known as En plein air.

==History==
Some of the first British artists to settle in the area had already travelled in Brittany, but found in Newlyn a comparable English environment with a number of things guaranteed to attract them: fantastic light, cheap living, and the availability of inexpensive models. The artists were fascinated by the fishermen&#x27;s working life at sea and the everyday life in the harbour and nearby villages. Some paintings showed the hazards and tragedy of the community&#x27;s life, such as women anxiously looking out to sea as the boats go out, or a young woman crying on hearing news of a disaster. Walter Langley is generally recognised as the pioneer of the Newlyn art colony and Stanhope Forbes, who settled there in 1884, as the father of it. The local newspaper (The Cornishman) was positive about the artists, reporting that the area had much to thank them for ″... circulating money, ...″, and ″... are ever ready to assist in anything which pertains to the welfare of the town.″

The later Forbes School of Painting, founded by Forbes and his wife Elizabeth in 1899, promoted the study of figure painting. A present-day Newlyn School of Art was formed in 2011 with Arts Council funding providing art courses taught by many of the best-known artists working in Cornwall today.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Lamorna, a nearby fishing village to the south, became popular with artists of the Newlyn School and is particularly associated with the artist S J &quot;Lamorna&quot; Birch who lived there from 1908.

<doc id="21822" wikidata="Q491782" url="?curid=21822" title="Natural Law Party">
<text>The Natural Law Party (NLP) is a transnational party founded in 1992 on &quot;the principles of Transcendental Meditation&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowan/Bromley&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the laws of nature, and their application to all levels of government. At its peak, it was active in up to 74 countries; it continues in India and at the state level in the United States. The party defines &quot;natural law&quot; as the organizing intelligence which governs the natural universe. The Natural Law Party advocates using the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi program as tools to enliven natural law and reduce or eliminate problems in society.

Prominent candidates included John Hagelin for U.S. president and Doug Henning as representative of Rosedale, Toronto, Canada. George Harrison performed a benefit concert in support of the party in 1992. Electoral success was achieved by the Ajeya Bharat Party in India, which elected a legislator to the state assembly, and the Croatian NLP, which elected a member of their regional assembly in 1993. In 2002, in the USA, its organization was reported to rival that of other &quot;established third parties&quot;, but most party chapters have since disbanded.

==History and platform==
According to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Natural Law Party (NLP) was first founded in the United Kingdom in March 1992 and was later established in the United States, France, Austria, Germany, Croatia, Israel, Japan, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Australia, Norway, Sweden, New Zealand, Chile, Thailand and Canada. The American branch of the party was founded later that year in Fairfield, Iowa U.S.A. by educators, business leaders, lawyers and other supporters of the Transcendental Meditation movement. The party was active in many countries and delegates from 60 countries attended an international convention in Bonn, Germany in 1998. The party became largely inactive in the United States in 2004 and was discontinued in the Netherlands in 2007.

The party had its foundation in the principles of Transcendental Meditation and was committed to &quot;prevention oriented government and conflict free politics&quot; through holistic health programmes and the practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique. In Scotland and Wales, party advertisements proclaimed that &quot;natural law which silently governs the whole universe in perfect order and without a problem.&quot; The Scotland and Wales branch of the party promised reduced pollution, the elimination of genetically modified crops and an increase in sustainable agriculture. They also supported free college education and the use of the Transcendental Meditation technique in the school system. In the UK, NLP candidate Geoffrey Clements advocated the use of Transcendental Meditation and the TM-Sidhi program&#x27;s yogic flying practice to reduce crime and war deaths. In the U.S.A. its platform included clean energy, labeling of genetically modified foods, a ban on the construction of nuclear energy plants, and an end to political action committees.

==National branches==
The Natural Law Party was reported to be active in 74 countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom and the United States.

===Australia===
In 1993, Bevan Morris campaigned for a seat in a district in suburban Adelaide for the Australian House of Representatives on the NLP ticket. The party contested several federal and state elections between 1990 and 1998.

===Canada===

The Natural Law Party was active in the Canadian federal elections of 1993, 1997 and 2000 and in provincial elections in Ontario and Quebec during this period; it was deregistered in 2003.

===Croatia===
In Croatia, a party member was elected to a regional assembly in 1993.

===France===
Benoît Frappé of France was the party&#x27;s candidate for the European Parliament.

===India===
The Natural Law Party in India is known as the Ajeya Bharat Party (AJBP) or Invincible India Party. It promotes a Vedic way of life. It was formed in late 1998 as the political wing of the Maharishi Vedic Vishwa Prashasan (MVVP (Maharishi Global Administration Through Natural Law)), which had nominated thirty-four candidates in the February 1998 parliamentary election from Madhya Pradesh. The Maharishi was said to be &quot;keenly interested&quot; in building a political base in his native province. The MVVP received 0.28% of the vote in its first election. Mukesh Nayak left the cabinet and the Congress Party to assume the leadership of the Madhya Pradesh MVVP. For the November 1998 election, the Ajeya Bharat had a list of 100 candidates for the Assembly. It received 0.5% of the vote and won one seat in the 320-member state assembly. The following year, that member switched parties, leaving the Ajeya Bharat with no representation. In 2008, Nayak left the party to rejoin the Congress Party. In 2009, the Ajeya Bharat Party president, Ambati Krishnamurthy, filed a complaint against another party for using a flag similar to its own.

===Ireland===
The Natural Law Party became active in Ireland in 1994 and was based in Dublin. The party leader was John Burns, who was one of nine Natural Law Party candidates in the 1997 general election. In addition, there were four candidates in the European elections of 1999. Burns endorsed the alternative health system of Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health and the five European candidates gained about 0.5% of first-preference votes cast. Burns, who also contested the 1999 Dublin South-Central by-election, spent only £163 on his campaign. After 1999, the party ceased to field candidates in Ireland. The amount of corporate political donations in 2000 was nil.

===Israel===
The Natural Law Party of Israel (, &quot;Mifleget Hok HaTeva Shel Yisrael&quot;) was a minor political party in Israel. Its leader was Amihai Rokah. In the 1992 elections the Natural Law Party won 1,734 votes (0.06%), and in the 1999 elections, won 2,924 votes (0.09%), both below the then 1.5% electoral threshold required to enter the Knesset. It has not run in an election since and its website states it has ceased political activity, but as of 2018 it is still registered as a party in Israel.

===Italy===
The Natural Law Party in Italy (&quot;Partito della Legge Naturale&quot;, PLN) participated in several (both general and local) elections in the nineties. In the 1994 general elections it won 24,897 votes (0.06%) for the Chamber of Deputies and 86,588 votes (0.26%) for the Senate. The list was on ballot in a few constituencies only. In the 1996 general elections the Natural Law Party ran candidates only in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region, who won 8,298 votes for the Chamber of Deputies and 5,842 for the Senate (about 1% on a regional basis, 0.2% in the whole country).

=== New Zealand ===
The Natural Law Party contested New Zealand general elections such as the 1996 election. It did not win any representation.

=== Trinidad and Tobago ===
The Natural Law Party in Trinidad and Tobago contested the 1995 general elections. It received 1,590 votes, but failed to win a seat.

===United Kingdom===
The Natural Law Party was founded in the United Kingdom in March 1992. Geoffrey Clements was its leader.

The UK manifesto, as published on its website, listed five key aspects of a successful government including:
# The development of each individual&#x27;s consciousness through the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programme
# Reduce health care costs by training the citizens in personal health assessment via self-pulse reading, an aspect of the Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health.
# Maintaining the collective health of the country by creating groups of experts in the TM-Sidhi programme&#x27;s Yogic Flying technique.
# Bringing the individual and the country into tune with Natural Law so that unfavourable planetary influences are neutralised.
# Assuring that the country&#x27;s work and home environments support health, and happiness.

In the 1992 general election, held on 9 April, the NLP contested 310 seats in the UK, garnering 0.19% of the vote, with every candidate losing their deposit for failing to receive at least 5% of the vote. The group announced that they had budgeted nearly £1 million for the campaign. A significant number of constituencies were contested by nationals of countries outside the UK, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and India, as British electoral law allows any member of a Commonwealth country to stand for Parliament. Among them was Canadian-born magician Doug Henning. Despite the &quot;dismal&quot; number of votes, an article in &quot;The Herald&quot; of Scotland reported that it could be considered a &quot;reasonable return for a campaign which began only three weeks before polling day.&quot; In addition the NLP &quot;notched up&quot; a &quot;headline-grabbing record&quot; when it put forward candidates for all 87 United Kingdom seats in the 1994 European Parliament; the first party to do so.

George Harrison performed a fund-raising concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London for the NLP on 6 April 1992, his first full concert in the UK since 1969. According to Harrison, a week before the general election, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi suggested to Harrison that he, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr stand for election as MPs for Liverpool as NLP candidates, but they declined.

In the 1997 general election, the NLP ran 197 candidates for Parliament in the UK, garnering 0.1% of the vote, with every candidate losing their deposit.

The NLP ran 16 candidates in the 20 by-elections held between 1992 and 1997, with every candidate losing their deposit. The NLP ran eight candidates for the 16 by-elections held between 1997 and 2001, averaging 0.10% of the vote, with every candidate losing their deposit. The NLP did not run any candidates for Parliament in the 2001 general election or in the succeeding by-elections. The party, along with its Northern Ireland wing, voluntarily deregistered with the Electoral Commission at the end of 2003.

====Northern Ireland====
It contested its first election in Northern Ireland in the 1994 EU elections. According to the NLP, they prepared a 70-page report in response to the &quot;1996 Framework Document of the British and Irish governments.&quot; The report was presented to leaders in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the U.S. Afterwards, NLP representatives participated in the &quot;special elections to the Northern Ireland Forum&quot;, but withdrew before the election.

===United States===

The Natural Law Party (United States) ran John Hagelin as its presidential candidate in 1992, 1996, and 2000. He was on ballots in 48 states and received 110,000 votes (0.12%) in 1996. The party also ran congressional and local candidates. In California, psychiatrist Harold H. Bloomfield ran as candidate for governor in 1998. It attempted to merge with the Reform Party in 2000. The NLP in the United States was largely disbanded in 2004. However, some state affiliates, such as Michigan, have kept their ballot positions and allied with other small parties.

<doc id="21826" wikidata="Q376789" url="?curid=21826" title="Naturalistic fallacy">
<text>In metaethics, the naturalistic fallacy is the claim that it is possible to define good in terms of merely described entities, properties, or processes such as &quot;pleasant&quot;, &quot;desirable&quot;, or &quot;fitness&quot;. The term was introduced by British philosopher G. E. Moore in his 1903 book &quot;Principia Ethica&quot;.

Moore&#x27;s naturalistic fallacy is closely related to the is–ought problem, which comes from David Hume&#x27;s &quot;Treatise of Human Nature&quot; (1738–40); however, unlike Hume&#x27;s view of the is–ought problem, Moore (and other proponents of ethical non-naturalism) did not consider the naturalistic fallacy to be at odds with moral realism.

==Common uses==

===The is–ought problem===
The term &quot;naturalistic fallacy&quot; is sometimes used to label the problematic inference of an &quot;ought&quot; from an &quot;is&quot; (the is–ought problem). Michael Ridge relevantly elaborates that &quot;[t]he intuitive idea is that evaluative conclusions require at least one evaluative premise—purely factual premises about the naturalistic features of things do not entail or even support evaluative conclusions.&quot; This problematic inference usually takes the form of saying that if people generally &quot;do&quot; something (e.g., eat three times a day, smoke cigarettes, dress warmly in cold weather), then people &quot;ought to&quot; do that thing. The naturalistic fallacy occurs when the is–ought inference (&quot;People eat three times a day, so it is morally good for people to eat three times a day&quot;) is justified by the claim that whatever practice exists is a natural one (&quot;because eating three times a day is pleasant and desirable&quot;).

Bentham, in discussing the relations of law and morality, found that when people discuss problems and issues they talk about how they wish it would be, instead of how it actually is. This can be seen in discussions of natural law and positive law. Bentham criticized natural law theory because in his view it was an instance of the naturalistic fallacy, claiming that it described how things are rather than how they ought to be.

===Moore&#x27;s discussion===
According to G. E. Moore&#x27;s &quot;Principia Ethica&quot;, when philosophers try to define &quot;good&quot; reductively, in terms of natural properties like &quot;pleasant&quot; or &quot;desirable&quot;, they are committing the naturalistic fallacy.
In defense of ethical non-naturalism against ethical naturalism, Moore&#x27;s argument is concerned with the semantic and metaphysical underpinnings of ethics. Moore argues that good, in the sense of intrinsic value, is simply ineffable. It cannot be defined because it is not reducible to other properties, being &quot;one of those innumerable objects of thought which are themselves incapable of definition, because they are the ultimate terms by reference to which whatever &#x27;is&#x27; capable of definition must be defined&quot;. On the other hand, ethical naturalists eschew such principles in favor of a more empirically accessible analysis of what it means to be good: for example, in terms of pleasure in the context of hedonism.

In §7, Moore argues that a property is either a complex of simple properties, or else it is irreducibly simple. Complex properties can be defined in terms of their constituent parts but a simple property lacks parts. In addition to &quot;good&quot; and &quot;pleasure&quot;, Moore suggests that colour qualia are undefined: if one wants to understand yellow, one must see examples of it. It will do no good to read the dictionary and learn that &quot;yellow&quot; names the colour of egg yolks and ripe lemons, or that &quot;yellow&quot; names the primary colour between green and orange on the spectrum, or that the perception of yellow is stimulated by electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of between 570 and 590 nanometers, because yellow is all that and more, by the open question argument.

===Appeal to nature===
Some people use the phrase, &quot;naturalistic fallacy&quot; or &quot;appeal to nature&quot;, in a different sense, to characterize inferences of the form &quot;Something is natural; therefore, it is morally acceptable&quot; or &quot;This property is unnatural; therefore, this property is undesirable.&quot; Such inferences are common in discussions of medicine, homosexuality, environmentalism, and veganism.
==Criticism==
Bernard Williams called Moore&#x27;s use of the term &quot;naturalistic fallacy&quot; a &quot;spectacular misnomer&quot;, the matter in question being metaphysical, as opposed to rational.

Some philosophers reject the naturalistic fallacy or suggest solutions for the proposed is–ought problem.

===Bound-up functions===
Ralph McInerny suggests that &quot;ought&quot; is already bound up in &quot;is&quot;, insofar as the very nature of things have ends/goals within them. For example, a clock is a device used to keep time. When one understands the function of a clock, then a standard of evaluation is implicit in the very description of the clock, i.e., because it &quot;is&quot; a clock, it &quot;ought&quot; to keep the time. Thus, if one cannot pick a good clock from a bad clock, then one does not really know what a clock is. In like manner, if one cannot determine good human action from bad, then one does not really know what the human person is.

===Irrationality of anti-naturalistic fallacy===
The belief that naturalistic fallacy is inherently flawed has been criticized as lacking rational bases, and labelled anti-naturalistic fallacy. For instance, Alex Walter wrote:

:&quot;The naturalistic fallacy and Hume&#x27;s &#x27;law&#x27; are frequently appealed to for the purpose of drawing limits around the scope of scientific inquiry into ethics and morality. These two objections are shown to be without force.&quot;

That is because said beliefs implicitly assert that there is no connection between the facts and the norms (in particular, between the facts and the mental process that led to adoption of the norms). However, philosophers show that these connections are inevitable. 

A very basic example is that if people view rescuing people as morally correct, this would shape their beliefs on what constitutes danger and what situations warrant intervention. For wider-ranging examples, if one believes that a certain ethnic group of humans have a population-level statistical hereditary predisposition to destroy civilization while the other person does not believe that such is the case, that difference in beliefs about factual matters will make the first person conclude that persecution of said ethnic group is an excusable &quot;necessary evil&quot; while the second person will conclude that it is a totally unjustifiable evil. 

Similarly, if two people think it is evil to keep people working extremely hard in extreme poverty, they will draw different conclusions on de facto rights (as opposed to purely semantic rights) of property owners. The latter is dependent on whether they believe property owners are responsible for the aforementioned exploitation. One who accepts this premise would conclude that it is necessary to persecute property owners to mitigate exploitation. The one who does not, on the other hand, would conclude that the persecution is unnecessary and evil.

===Inconsistent application===
Some critics of the assumption that is-ought conclusions are fallacies point at observations of people who purport to consider such conclusions as fallacies do not do so consistently. Examples mentioned are that evolutionary psychologists who gripe about &quot;the naturalistic fallacy&quot; do make is-ought conclusions themselves when, for instance, alleging that the notion of the blank slate would lead to totalitarian social engineering or that certain views on sexuality would lead to attempts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuals. Critics point at this as a sign that charges of the naturalistic fallacy are inconsistent rhetorical tactics rather than detection of a fallacy.

===Universally normative allegations of varied harm===
A criticism of the concept of the naturalistic fallacy is that while &quot;descriptive&quot; statements (used here in the broad sense about statements that purport to be about facts regardless of whether they are true or false, used simply as opposed to normative statements) about specific differences in effects can be inverted depending on values (such as the statement &quot;people X are predisposed to eating babies&quot; being normative against group X only in the context of protecting children while the statement &quot;individual or group X is predisposed to emit greenhouse gases&quot; is normative against individual/group X only in the context of protecting the environment), the statement &quot;individual/group X is predisposed to harm whatever values others have&quot; is universally normative against individual/group X. This refers to individual/group X being &quot;descriptively&quot; alleged to detect what other entities capable of valuing are protecting and then destroying it without individual/group X having any values of its own. For example, in the context of one philosophy advocating child protection considering eating babies the worst evil and advocating industries that emit greenhouse gases to finance a safe short term environment for children while another philosophy considers long term damage to the environment the worst evil and advocates eating babies to reduce overpopulation and with it consumption that emits greenhouse gases, such an individual/group X could be alleged to advocate both eating babies and building autonomous industries to maximize greenhouse gas emissions, making the two otherwise enemy philosophies become allies against individual/group X as a &quot;common enemy&quot;. The principle, that of allegations of an individual or group being predisposed to adapt their harm to damage any values including combined harm of apparently opposite values inevitably making normative implications regardless of which the specific values are, is argued to extend to any other situations with any other values as well due to the allegation being of the individual or group adapting their destruction to different values. This is mentioned as an example of at least one type of &quot;descriptive&quot; allegation being bound to make universally normative implications, as well as the allegation not being scientifically self-correcting due to individual or group X being alleged to manipulate others to support their alleged all-destructive agenda which dismisses any scientific criticism of the allegation as &quot;part of the agenda that destroys everything&quot;, and that the objection that some values may condemn some specific ways to persecute individual/group X is irrelevant since different values would also have various ways to do things against individuals or groups that they would consider acceptable to do. This is pointed out as a falsifying counterexample to the claim that &quot;no descriptive statement can in itself become normative&quot;.

<text>Neapolitan ice cream, also sometimes referred to as Harlequin ice cream, is an ice cream composed of three separate flavors (typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry) arranged side by side in the same container, usually without any barrier between them.

==History==
Neapolitan ice cream was the first ice cream recipe to combine three flavors. The first recorded recipe was created by head chef of the royal Prussian household Louis Ferdinand Jungius in 1839, who dedicated the recipe to the nobleman, Fürst Pückler. The German name for Neapolitan ice cream is &quot;&quot;.

Its English-language name of Neapolitan arose in the late 19th century due to confusion about its origin given Italy&#x27;s reputation for ice cream or because its colors—originally green (pistachio), white (vanilla) and red (cherry)—matched those of the Italian flag. Early recipes featured a variety of flavors, but the combination of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry became the standard, likely because these were the most popular flavors in the United States at the time of its introduction.

<doc id="21830" wikidata="Q7860" url="?curid=21830" title="Nature">
<text>Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.

During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial Revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.

Within the various uses of the word today, &quot;nature&quot; often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living beings, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the &quot;natural environment&quot; or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, &quot;human nature&quot; or &quot;the whole of nature&quot;. This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term &quot;natural&quot; might also be distinguished from the or the supernatural.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;nature&quot; is borrowed from the Old French &quot;nature&quot; and is derived from the Latin word &quot;natura&quot;, or &quot;essential qualities, innate disposition&quot;, and in ancient times, literally meant &quot;birth&quot;. In ancient philosophy, &quot;natura&quot; is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word &quot;physis&quot; (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own accord.
The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.

==Earth==

Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the Solar System, it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region. Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth&#x27;s surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

The atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms, which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods, and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.

===Geology===

Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.

====Geological evolution====

The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrude into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.

===Historical perspective===

Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54 billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The Moon formed roughly 20 million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago.

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent. Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540 million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180 million years ago.

During the Neoproterozoic era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in glaciers and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the &quot;Snowball Earth&quot;, and it is of particular interest as it precedes the Cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540 million years ago.

Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals. Over the past 66 million years, mammalian life diversified.

Several million years ago, a species of small African ape gained the ability to stand upright. The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300 million years to culminate.

The present era is classified as part of a mass extinction event, the Holocene extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred. Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100 years. The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.
==Atmosphere, climate, and weather==
The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat. Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.

Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth&#x27;s orbit. Based on historical and geological records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.

The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially latitude. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth&#x27;s axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the Northern and Southern Hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a chaotic system that is readily modified by small changes to the environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days. Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.

==Water on Earth==
Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital for all known forms of life. In typical usage, &quot;water&quot; refers only to its liquid form, but it also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth&#x27;s surface. On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth&#x27;s water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

===Oceans===
An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth&#x27;s surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over deep. Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several &#x27;separate&#x27; oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean. This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names. There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and the Great Salt Lake.

===Lakes===
A lake (from Latin word &quot;lacus&quot;) is a terrain feature (or physical feature), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan&#x27;s lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan&#x27;s surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or human-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of human-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.

===Rivers===
A river is a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is &quot;Burn&quot; in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).

===Streams===
A stream is a flowing body of water with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than wide. Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration. The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone. Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, fish biology, riparian ecology, and others.

==Ecosystems==


Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an interrelated way. The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms interact with every other element in their local environment. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: &quot;Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the &quot;community&quot;) in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.&quot; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the food chain, and exchange energy and matter between themselves as well as with their environment. The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature dichotomy and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope.

A smaller unit of size is called a microecosystem. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A &quot;macroecosystem&quot; might involve a whole ecoregion, with its drainage basin.

===Wilderness===
Wilderness is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, national forests, national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity, and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth&#x27;s self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere). They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.

==Life==

Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction. Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms.

Present day organisms from viruses to humans possess a self-replicating informational molecule (genome), either DNA or RNA (as in some viruses), and such an informational molecule is probably intrinsic to life. It is likely that the earliest forms of life were based on a self-replicating informational molecule (genome), perhaps RNA or a molecule more primitive than RNA or DNA. The specific deoxyribonucleotide/ribonucleotide sequence in each currently extant individual organism contains sequence information that functions to promotes survival, reproduction, and the capacity to acquire resources necessary for reproduction, and such sequences probably emerged early in the evolution of life. Survival functions present early in the evolution of life likely also included genomic sequences that promote the avoidance of damage to the self-replicating molecule and also the capability to repair such damages that do occur. Repair of some genome damages may have involved using information from another similar molecule by a process of recombination (a primitive form of sexual interaction).

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made analogs of life may also be considered to be life.

The biosphere is the part of Earth&#x27;s outer shell—including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere—within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). The entire Earth contains over 75 billion tons (150 &quot;trillion&quot; pounds or about 6.8×1013 kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.

Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence. More than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date, and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50 million. The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis. The total number of species is in rapid decline.

===Evolution===
The origin of life on Earth is not well understood, but it is known to have occurred at least 3.5 billion years ago, during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present. These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.

When basic forms of plant life developed the process of photosynthesis the sun&#x27;s energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms. The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone layer. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.

===Microbes===
The first form of life to develop on the Earth were unicellular, and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear. Microorganisms or microbes are microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see. Microorganisms can be single-celled, such as Bacteria, Archaea, many Protista, and a minority of Fungi.

These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where there is liquid water, including in the Earth&#x27;s interior.
Their reproduction is both rapid and profuse. The combination of a high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer ability makes them highly adaptable, and able to survive in new and sometimes very harsh environments, including outer space. They form an essential part of the planetary ecosystem. However, some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms.

Viruses are infectious agents, but they are not autonomous life forms, as it is the case for viroids, satellites, DPIs and prions.

===Plants and animals===

Originally Aristotle divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In Linnaeus&#x27; system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora, and some classifications use the term &quot;bacterial flora&quot; separately from &quot;plant flora&quot;.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional floras, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include &quot;fossil flora&quot;, remnants of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and terrain.

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as &quot;native flora&quot; or &quot;agricultural and garden flora&quot;. Some types of &quot;native flora&quot; actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for &quot;weeds&quot;. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way to categorize &quot;useless&quot; plants, the informal use of the word &quot;weeds&quot; to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as &quot;domestic&quot;, &quot;farm animals&quot;, &quot;wild animals&quot;, &quot;pests&quot;, etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular, which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two phyla consisting of sponges and placozoans—animals have bodies that are differentiated into tissues. These include muscles, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a nervous system, which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal digestive chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins. This may be calcified to form structures like shells, bones, and spicules, a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

==Human interrelationship==

===Human impact===
Although humans comprise a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and &quot;made environments&quot; is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace. A 2020 study published in &quot;Nature&quot; found that anthropogenic mass (human-made materials) outweighs all living biomass on earth, with plastic alone exceeding the mass of all land and marine animals combined. And according to a 2021 study published in &quot;Frontiers in Forests and Global Change&quot;, only about 3% of the planet&#x27;s terrestrial surface is ecologically and faunally intact, with a low human footprint and healthy populations of native animal species. Philip Cafaro, professor of philosophy at the School of Global Environmental Sustainability at Colorado State University, wrote in 2022 that &quot;the cause of global biodiversity loss is clear: other species are being displaced by a rapidly growing human economy.&quot;

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood. Human-made threats to the Earth&#x27;s natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals, with roughly 1 million species threatened with extinction within decades. The loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functions over the last half century have impacted the extent that nature can contribute to human quality of life, and continued declines could pose a major threat to the existence of human civilization, unless a rapid course correction is made. The value of natural resources to human society is poorly reflected in market prices because except for labour costs the natural resources are available free of charge. This distorts market pricing of natural resources and at the same time leads to underinvestment in our natural assets. The annual global cost of public subsidies that damage nature is conservatively estimated at $4–6 trillion (million million). Institutional protections of these natural goods, such as the oceans and rainforests, are lacking. Governments have not prevented these economic externalities.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world&#x27;s economic system. Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. Agriculture was first adopted around the 9th millennium BCE. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.

===Aesthetics and beauty===

Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature &quot;as it is&quot; became one of the aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the Psalms and the Book of Job, wilderness portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the Romantic movement. British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. William Wordsworth&#x27;s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture. This artistic movement also coincided with the Transcendentalist movement in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word mimesis, the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in nature. As David Rothenburg writes, &quot;The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see&quot;.

==Matter and energy==
The natural sciences view matter as obeying certain laws of nature which scientists seek to understand.
Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the observable universe. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent cold dark matter and 68.3 percent dark energy. The exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists.

The behaviour of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws. These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants that appear to be static across the observable universe. The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.

==Beyond Earth==

Outer space, also simply called &quot;space&quot;, refers to the relatively empty regions of the Universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies. &quot;Outer&quot; space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at what is known as the heliopause.

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous crewed and uncrewed launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although Earth is the only body within the Solar System known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet Mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface. For a brief period in Mars&#x27; history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.

Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar Earth analogs – planets that lie in the habitable zone of space surrounding a star, and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.

<text>In astronomy, the new moon is the first lunar phase, when the Moon and Sun have the same ecliptic longitude. At this phase, the lunar disk is not visible to the naked eye, except when it is silhouetted against the Sun during a solar eclipse.

The original meaning of the term &#x27;new moon&#x27;, which is still sometimes used in calendrical, non-astronomical contexts, is the first visible crescent of the Moon after conjunction with the Sun. This thin crescent is briefly and faintly visible as the Moon gets lower in the western sky after sunset. The precise time and even the date of the appearance of the new moon by this definition will be influenced by the geographical location of the observer. The first crescent marks the beginning of the month in the Islamic calendar and in some lunisolar calendars such as the Hebrew calendar. In the Chinese calendar, the beginning of the month is marked by the last visible crescent of a Moon.

The astronomical new moon occurs by definition at the moment of conjunction in ecliptical longitude with the Sun when the Moon is invisible from the Earth. This moment is unique and does not depend on location, and in certain circumstances, it coincides with a solar eclipse.

A lunation, or synodic month, is the period from one new moon to the next. At the J2000.0 epoch, the average length of a lunation is 29.53059 days (or 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 3 seconds). However, the length of any one synodic month can vary from 29.26 to 29.80 days (12.96 hours) due to the perturbing effects of the Sun&#x27;s gravity on the Moon&#x27;s eccentric orbit.

==Lunation number== 

The &quot;Lunation Number&quot; or &quot;Lunation Cycle&quot; is a number given to each beginning from a specific one in history. Several conventions are in use.

The most commonly used was the Brown Lunation Number (BLN), which defines &quot;lunation 1&quot; as beginning at the first new moon of 1923, the year when Ernest William Brown&#x27;s lunar theory was introduced in the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac. Lunation 1 occurred at approximately 02:41 UTC, 17 January 1923. With later refinements, the BLN was used in almanacs until 1983.

A more recent lunation number called the Lunation Number (LN) was introduced by Jean Meeus in 1998, and defines lunation 0 as beginning on the first new moon of 2000 (this occurred at approximately 18:14 UTC, 6 January 2000). The formula relating Meeus&#x27;s Lunation Number to the Brown Lunation Number is BLN = LN + 953.

The Goldstine Lunation Number (GLN) refers to the lunation numbering used by Herman Goldstine, with lunation 0 beginning on 11 January 1001 BCE, and can be calculated using GLN = LN + 37105.

The Hebrew Lunation Number (HLN) is the count of lunations in the Hebrew calendar with lunation 1 beginning on 6 October 3761 BCE. It can be calculated using HLN = LN + 71234.

The Islamic Lunation Number (ILN) is the count of lunations in the Islamic Calendar with lunation 1 as beginning on the first day of the month of Muharram, which occurred in 622  CE (15 July, Julian, in the proleptic reckoning). It can be calculated using ILN = LN + 17038.

The Thai Lunation Number (TLN) is called &quot;มาสเกณฑ์&quot; (Maasa-Kendha), defines lunation 0 as the beginning of Burmese era of the Buddhist calendar on Sunday, 22 March 638 CE. It can be calculated using TLN = LN + 16843.

== Lunisolar calendars ==
===Hebrew calendar===
The new moon, in Hebrew Rosh Chodesh, signifies the start of every Hebrew month and is considered an important date and minor holiday in the Hebrew calendar. The modern form of the calendar practiced in Judaism is a rule-based lunisolar calendar, akin to the Chinese calendar, measuring months defined in lunar cycles as well as years measured in solar cycles, and distinct from the purely lunar Islamic calendar and the predominantly solar Gregorian calendar. The Jewish months are fixed to the annual seasons by setting the new moon of Aviv, the &quot;barley ripening&quot;, or &quot;spring&quot;, as the first moon and head of the year. Since the Babylonian captivity, this month is called Nisan, and it is calculated based on mathematical rules designed to ensure that festivals are observed in their traditional season. Passover always falls in the springtime. This fixed lunisolar calendar follows rules introduced by Hillel II and refined until the ninth century. This calculation makes use of a mean lunation length used by Ptolemy and handed down from Babylonians, which is still very accurate: ca. 29.530594 days vs. a present value (see below) of 29.530589 days. This difference of only 0.000005, or five millionths of a day, adds up to about only four hours since Babylonian times.

===Chinese calendar===

The new moon is the beginning of the month in the Chinese calendar. Some Buddhist Chinese keep a vegetarian diet on the new moon and full moon each month.

=== Hindu calendar ===

The new moon is significant in the lunar Hindu calendar. The first day of the calendar starts the day after the dark moon phase (Amavasya).

There are fifteen moon dates for each of the waxing and waning periods. These fifteen dates are divided evenly into five categories: Nanda, Bhadra&#x27;, Jaya, Rikta, and Purna, which are cycled through in that order.
Nanda dates are considered to be favorable for auspicious works; Bhadra dates for works related to community, social, family, and friends; and Jaya dates for dealing with conflict. Rikta dates are considered beneficial only for works related to cruelty. Purna dates are considered to be favorable for all work.

=== Babylonian calendar ===
== Lunar calendars ==
===Islamic calendar===

The lunar Hijri calendar has exactly 12 lunar months in a year of 354 or 355 days. It has retained an observational definition of the new moon, marking the new month when the first crescent moon is seen, and making it impossible to be certain in advance of when a specific month will begin (in particular, the exact date on which the month of Ramadan will begin is not known in advance). In Saudi Arabia, the new King Abdullah Centre for Crescent Observations and Astronomy in Mecca has a clock for addressing this as an international scientific project. In Pakistan, there is a &quot;Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee&quot; whose head is Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman, assisted by 150 observatories of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, which announces the sighting of the new moon.

An attempt to unify Muslims on a scientifically calculated worldwide calendar was adopted by both the Fiqh Council of North America and the European Council for Fatwa and Research in 2007. The new calculation requires that conjunction must occur before sunset in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and that, on the same evening, the moonset must take place after sunset. These can be precisely calculated and therefore a unified calendar is possible should it become adopted worldwide.

==Solar calendars holding moveable feasts==
===Baháʼí calendar===

The Baháʼí calendar is a solar calendar with certain new moons observed as moveable feasts.
In the Baháʼí Faith, effective from 2015 onwards, the &quot;Twin Holy Birthdays&quot;, refer to two successive holy days in the Baháʼí calendar (the birth of the Báb and the birth of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh), will be observed on the first and the second day following the occurrence of the eighth new moon after Naw-Rúz (Baháʼí New Year), as determined in advance by astronomical tables using Tehran as the point of reference. This will result in the observance of the Twin Birthdays moving, year to year, from mid-October to mid-November according to the Gregorian calendar.

===Christian liturgical calendar===
Easter, the most important feast in the Christian liturgical calendar, is a movable feast. The date of Easter is determined by reference to the ecclesiastical full moon, which, being historically difficult to determine with precision, is defined as being fourteen days after the (first crescent) new moon.

<text>In the mathematical subfield of numerical analysis, a B-spline or basis spline is a spline function that has minimal support with respect to a given degree, smoothness, and domain partition. Any spline function of given degree can be expressed as a linear combination of B-splines of that degree. Cardinal B-splines have knots that are equidistant from each other. B-splines can be used for curve-fitting and numerical differentiation of experimental data.

In computer-aided design and computer graphics, spline functions are constructed as linear combinations of B-splines with a set of control points.

==Introduction==
According to Gerald Farin, B-splines were explored as early as the nineteenth century by Nikolai Lobachevsky at Kazan University in Russia. The term &quot;B-spline&quot; was coined by Isaac Jacob Schoenberg in 1978 and is short for basis spline. 
A spline function of order formula_1 is a piecewise polynomial function of degree formula_2. The places where the pieces meet are known as knots. The key property of spline functions is that they and their derivatives may be continuous, depending on the multiplicities of the knots.

B-splines of order formula_1 are basis functions for spline functions of the same order defined over the same knots, meaning that all possible spline functions can be built from a linear combination of B-splines, and there is only one unique combination for each spline function.

==Definition==


A B-spline of order formula_4 is a collection of piecewise polynomial functions formula_5 of degree formula_6 in a variable formula_7.
The values of formula_7 where the pieces of polynomial meet are known as knots, denoted formula_9 and sorted into nondecreasing order.

For a given sequence of knots, there is, up to a scaling factor, a unique spline formula_5 satisfying
:formula_11

If we add the additional constraint that 
:formula_12 
for all formula_7 between the knots formula_14 and formula_15, then the scaling factor of formula_5 becomes fixed. 
The knots in-between (and not including) formula_14 and formula_15 are called the internal knots.

B-splines can be constructed by means of the Cox–de Boor recursion formula. 
We start with the B-splines of degree formula_19, i.e. piecewise constant polynomials.

:formula_20

The higher formula_21-degree B-splines are defined by recursion
:formula_22

==Properties==

A B-spline function is a combination of flexible bands that is controlled by a number of points that are called control points, creating smooth curves. These functions are used to create and manage complex shapes and surfaces using a number of points. B-spline function and Bézier functions are applied extensively in shape optimization methods.

A B-spline of order formula_1 is a piecewise polynomial function of degree formula_2 in a variable formula_25. It is defined over formula_26 locations formula_27, called knots or breakpoints, which must be in non-descending order formula_28. The B-spline contributes only in the range between the first and last of these knots and is zero elsewhere. If each knot is separated by the same distance formula_29 (where formula_30) from its predecessor, the knot vector and the corresponding B-splines are called &quot;uniform&quot; (see cardinal B-spline below).

For each finite knot interval where it is non-zero, a B-spline is a polynomial of degree formula_2. A B-spline is a continuous function at the knots. When all knots belonging to the B-spline are distinct, its derivatives are also continuous up to the derivative of degree formula_32. If the knots are coincident at a given value of formula_25, the continuity of derivative order is reduced by 1 for each additional coincident knot. B-splines may share a subset of their knots, but two B-splines defined over exactly the same knots are identical. In other words, a B-spline is uniquely defined by its knots.

One distinguishes internal knots and end points. Internal knots cover the formula_25-domain one is interested in. Since a single B-spline already extends over formula_26 knots, it follows that the internal knots need to be extended with formula_2 endpoints on each side, to give full support to the first and last B-spline, which affect the internal knot intervals. The values of the endpoints do not matter, usually the first or last internal knot is just repeated.

The usefulness of B-splines lies in the fact that any spline function of order formula_1 on a given set of knots can be expressed as a linear combination of B-splines:
: formula_38
B-splines play the role of basis functions for the spline function space, hence the name. This property follows from the fact that all pieces have the same continuity properties, within their individual range of support, at the knots.

Expressions for the polynomial pieces can be derived by means of the Cox–de Boor recursion formula

:formula_39

:formula_40

That is, formula_41 is piecewise constant one or zero indicating which knot span &quot;x&quot; is in (zero if knot span &quot;j&quot; is repeated). The recursion equation is in two parts: 
:formula_42 
ramps from zero to one as &quot;x&quot; goes from formula_43 to formula_44, and
:formula_45
ramps from one to zero as &quot;x&quot; goes from formula_46 to formula_47. The corresponding &quot;B&quot;s are zero outside those respective ranges. For example, formula_48 is a triangular function that is zero below formula_49, ramps to one at formula_50 and back to zero at and beyond formula_51. However, because B-spline basis functions have local support, B-splines are typically computed by algorithms that do not need to evaluate basis functions where they are zero, such as de Boor&#x27;s algorithm.

This relation leads directly to the FORTRAN-coded algorithm BSPLV, which generates values of the B-splines of order &quot;n&quot; at &quot;x&quot;. The following scheme illustrates how each piece of order &quot;n&quot; is a linear combination of the pieces of B-splines of order &quot;n&quot; − 1 to its left.

:formula_52

Application of the recursion formula with the knots at formula_53 gives the pieces of the uniform B-spline of order 3 
:formula_54
These pieces are shown in the diagram. The continuity property of a quadratic spline function and its first derivative at the internal knots are illustrated, as follows
: formula_55
The second derivative of a B-spline of degree 2 is discontinuous at the knots:
: formula_56

Faster variants of the de Boor algorithm have been proposed, but they suffer from comparatively lower stability.

===Cardinal B-spline===

A cardinal B-spline has a constant separation &quot;h&quot; between knots. The cardinal B-splines for a given order &quot;n&quot; are just shifted copies of each other. They can be obtained from the simpler definition.

:formula_57

The &quot;placeholder&quot; notation is used to indicate that the &quot;n&quot;-th divided difference of the function formula_58 of the two variables &quot;t&quot; and &quot;x&quot; is to be taken by fixing &quot;x&quot; and considering formula_59 as a function of &quot;t&quot; alone.

A cardinal B-spline has uniformly spaced knots, therefore interpolation between the knots equals convolution with a smoothing kernel.

Example, if we want to interpolate three values in between B-spline nodes (formula_60), we can write the signal as

: formula_61

Convolution of the signal formula_62 with a rectangle function formula_63 gives first order interpolated B-spline values. Second-order B-spline interpolation is convolution with a rectangle function twice formula_64; by iterative filtering with a rectangle function, higher-order interpolation is obtained.

Fast B-spline interpolation on a uniform sample domain can be done by iterative mean-filtering. Alternatively, a rectangle function equals sinc in Fourier domain. Therefore, cubic spline interpolation equals multiplying the signal in Fourier domain with sinc4.

See Irwin–Hall distribution#Special cases for algebraic expressions for the cardinal B-splines of degree 1–4.

===P-spline===

The term P-spline stands for &quot;penalized B-spline&quot;. It refers to using the B-spline representation where the coefficients are determined partly by the data to be fitted, and partly by an additional penalty function that aims to impose smoothness to avoid overfitting.

Two- and multidimensional P-spline approximations of data can use the face-splitting product of matrices to the minimization of calculation operations.

==Derivative expressions==
The derivative of a B-spline of degree &quot;k&quot; is simply a function of B-splines of degree &quot;k&quot; − 1:
:formula_65
This implies that
:formula_66
which shows that there is a simple relationship between the derivative of a spline function and the B-splines of degree one less.

==Moments of univariate B-splines==

Univariate B-splines, i.e. B-splines where the knot positions lie in a single dimension, can be used to represent 1-d probability density functions formula_67. An example is a weighted sum of formula_68 B-spline basis functions of order formula_1, which each are area-normalized to unity (i.e. not directly evaluated using the standard de-Boor algorithm)

: formula_70

and with normalization constant constraint formula_71.
The &quot;k&quot;-th raw moment formula_72 of a normalized B-spline formula_73 can be written as Carlson&#x27;s Dirichlet average formula_74, which in turn can be solved exactly via a contour integral and an iterative sum as

: formula_75

with

: formula_76
and formula_77. Here, formula_78 represents a vector with the formula_79 knot positions and formula_80 a vector with the respective knot multiplicities. One can therefore calculate any moment of a probability density function formula_67 represented by a sum of B-spline basis functions exactly, without resorting to numerical techniques.

==Relationship to piecewise/composite Bézier==
A Bézier curve is also a polynomial curve definable using a recursion from lower-degree curves of the same class and encoded in terms of control points, but a key difference is that all terms in the recursion for a Bézier curve segment have the same domain of definition (usually formula_82), whereas the supports of the two terms in the B-spline recursion are different (the outermost subintervals are not common). This means that a Bézier curve of degree formula_1 given by formula_84 control points consists of about formula_85 mostly independent segments, whereas the B-spline with the same parameters smoothly transitions from subinterval to subinterval. To get something comparable from a Bézier curve, one would need to impose a smoothness condition on transitions between segments, resulting in some manner of Bézier spline (for which many control points would be determined by the smoothness requirement).

A piecewise/composite Bézier curve is a series of Bézier curves joined with at least C0 continuity (the last point of one curve coincides with the starting point of the next curve). Depending on the application, additional smoothness requirements (such as C1 or C2 continuity) may be added. C1 continuous curves have identical tangents at the breakpoint (where the two curves meet). C2 continuous curves have identical curvature at the breakpoint.

== Curve fitting ==
Usually in curve fitting, a set of data points is fitted with a curve defined by some mathematical function. For example, common types of curve fitting use a polynomial or a set of exponential functions. When there is no theoretical basis for choosing a fitting function, the curve may be fitted with a spline function composed of a sum of B-splines, using the method of least squares. Thus, the objective function for least-squares minimization is, for a spline function of degree &quot;k&quot;,
: formula_86
where &quot;W&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a weight, and &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the datum value at &quot;x&quot;. The coefficients formula_87 are the parameters to be determined. The knot values may be fixed or treated as parameters.

The main difficulty in applying this process is in determining the number of knots to use and where they should be placed. de Boor suggests various strategies to address this problem. For instance, the spacing between knots is decreased in proportion to the curvature (2nd derivative) of the data. A few applications have been published. For instance, the use of B-splines for fitting single Lorentzian and Gaussian curves has been investigated. Optimal spline functions of degrees 3–7 inclusive, based on symmetric arrangements of 5, 6, and 7 knots, have been computed and the method was applied for smoothing and differentiation of spectroscopic curves. In a comparable study, the two-dimensional version of the Savitzky–Golay filtering and the spline method produced better results than moving average or Chebyshev filtering.

==Computer-aided design and computer graphics ==
In computer-aided design and computer graphics applications, a spline curve is sometimes represented as formula_88, a parametric curve of some real parameter formula_7. In this case the curve formula_88 can be treated as two or three separate coordinate functions formula_91, or formula_92. The coordinate functions formula_93, formula_94 and formula_95 are each spline functions, with a common set of knot values formula_96.

Because a B-splines form basis functions, each of the coordinate functions can be expressed as a linear sum of B-splines, so we have

:formula_97

The weights formula_98, formula_99 and formula_100 can be combined to form points formula_101 in 3-d space. These points formula_102 are commonly known as control points.

Working in reverse, a sequence of control points, knot values, and order of the B-spline define a parametric curve. This representation of a curve by control points has several useful properties:
# The control points formula_102 define a curve. If the control points are all transformed together in some way, such as being translated, rotated, scaled, or moved by any affine transformation, then the corresponding curve is transformed in the same way.
# Because the B-splines are non-zero for just a finite number of knot intervals, if a single control point is moved, the corresponding change to the parametric curve is just over the parameter range of a small number knot intervals.
# Because formula_104, and at all times each formula_105, then the curve remains inside the bounding box of the control points. Also, in some sense, the curve broadly follows the control points.

A less desirable feature is that the parametric curve does not interpolate the control points. Usually the curve does not pass through the control points.

== Cubic B-Splines ==
A cubic B-spline curve formula_106 with a normalized parameter formula_107 is defined by four nodes (i.e. &quot;control points&quot;) formula_108, formula_109, formula_110, and formula_111. It forms a polynomial of degree 3 that can be written as
: formula_112.
This corresponds to B-spline polynomials
: formula_113
and the curve can be evaluated as formula_114. Expanding this, we can write the full polynomial form as below
: formula_115.
Since this is a cubic polynomial, we can also write it as a cubic Bézier curve with control points formula_116, formula_117, formula_118, and formula_119, such that
: formula_120
A piecewise cubic B-spline is formed by a set of nodes and each four consecutive nodes define a cubic piece of the curve with the formulation above.

== NURBS ==

In computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing, and computer graphics, a powerful extension of B-splines is non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). NURBS are essentially B-splines in homogeneous coordinates. Like B-splines, they are defined by their order, and a knot vector, and a set of control points, but unlike simple B-splines, the control points each have a weight. When the weight is equal to 1, a NURBS is simply a B-spline and as such NURBS generalizes both B-splines and Bézier curves and surfaces, the primary difference being the weighting of the control points which makes NURBS curves &quot;rational&quot;.
By evaluating a NURBS at various values of the parameters, the curve can be traced through space; likewise, by evaluating a NURBS surface at various values of the two parameters, the surface can be represented in Cartesian space.

Like B-splines, NURBS control points determine the shape of the curve. Each point of the curve is computed by taking a weighted sum of a number of control points. The weight of each point varies according to the governing parameter. For a curve of degree &quot;d&quot;, the influence of any control point is only nonzero in &quot;d&quot;+1 intervals (knot spans) of the parameter space. Within those intervals, the weight changes according to a polynomial function (basis functions) of degree &quot;d&quot;. At the boundaries of the intervals, the basis functions go smoothly to zero, the smoothness being determined by the degree of the polynomial.

The knot vector is a sequence of parameter values that determines where and how the control points affect the NURBS curve. The number of knots is always equal to the number of control points plus curve degree plus one. Each time the parameter value enters a new knot span, a new control point becomes active, while an old control point is discarded.

A NURBS curve takes the following form:

: formula_121

Here the notation is as follows. &quot;u&quot; is the independent variable (instead of &quot;x&quot;), &quot;k&quot; is the number of control points, &quot;N&quot; is a B-spline (used instead of &quot;B&quot;), &quot;n&quot; is the polynomial degree, &quot;P&quot; is a control point and &quot;w&quot; is a weight. The denominator is a normalizing factor that evaluates to one if all weights are one.

It is customary to write this as

: formula_122

in which the functions

: formula_123

are known as the rational basis functions.

A NURBS surface is obtained as the tensor product of two NURBS curves, thus using two independent parameters &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; (with indices &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; respectively):

: formula_124

with

: formula_125

as rational basis functions.

<text>The North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is the point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation meets its surface. It is called the True North Pole to distinguish from the Magnetic North Pole.

The North Pole is by definition the northernmost point on the Earth, lying antipodally to the South Pole. It defines geodetic latitude 90° North, as well as the direction of true north. At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of longitude converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. No time zone has been assigned to the North Pole, so any time can be used as the local time. Along tight latitude circles, counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west. The North Pole is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere. The nearest land is usually said to be Kaffeklubben Island, off the northern coast of Greenland about away, though some perhaps semi-permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer. The nearest permanently inhabited place is Alert on Ellesmere Island, Canada, which is located from the Pole.

While the South Pole lies on a continental land mass, the North Pole is located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice. The sea depth at the North Pole has been measured at by the Russian Mir submersible in 2007 and at by USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; in 1958. This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole (unlike the South Pole). However, the Soviet Union, and later Russia, constructed a number of manned drifting stations on a generally annual basis since 1937, some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole. Since 2002, a group of Russians have also annually established a private base, Barneo, close to the Pole. This operates for a few weeks during early spring. Studies in the 2000s predicted that the North Pole may become seasonally ice-free because of Arctic ice shrinkage, with timescales varying from 2016 to the late 21st century or later.

Attempts to reach the North Pole began in the late 19th century, with the record for &quot;Farthest North&quot; being surpassed on numerous occasions. The first undisputed expedition to reach the North Pole was that of the airship &quot;Norge&quot;, which overflew the area in 1926 with 16 men on board, including expedition leader Roald Amundsen. Three prior expeditions – led by Frederick Cook (1908, land), Robert Peary (1909, land) and Richard E. Byrd (1926, aerial) – were once also accepted as having reached the Pole. However, in each case later analysis of expedition data has cast doubt upon the accuracy of their claims. 

The first verified individuals to reach the North Pole on the ground was in 1948 by a 24-man Soviet party, part of Aleksandr Kuznetsov&#x27;s &quot;Sever-2&quot; expedition to the Arctic, who flew part-way to the Pole first before making the final trek to it on foot. The first complete land expedition to reach the North Pole was in 1968 by Ralph Plaisted, Walt Pederson, Gerry Pitzl and Jean-Luc Bombardier, using snowmobiles and with air support.

==Precise definition==

The Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation – and hence the position of the North Pole – was commonly believed to be fixed (relative to the surface of the Earth) until, in the 18th century, the mathematician Leonhard Euler predicted that the axis might &quot;wobble&quot; slightly. Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent &quot;variation of latitude&quot;, as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars. Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earth&#x27;s surface, by a range of a few metres. The wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component. The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the eight-month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the Chandler wobble after its discoverer. The exact point of intersection of the Earth&#x27;s axis and the Earth&#x27;s surface, at any given moment, is called the &quot;instantaneous pole&quot;, but because of the &quot;wobble&quot; this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole (or South Pole) when metre-scale precision is required.

It is desirable to tie the system of Earth coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevations or orography) to fixed landforms. However, given plate tectonics and isostasy, there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed. Yet the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service and the International Astronomical Union have defined a framework called the International Terrestrial Reference System.

==Exploration==
===Pre-1900===
As early as the 16th century, many prominent people correctly believed that the North Pole was in a sea, which in the 19th century was called the Polynya or Open Polar Sea. It was therefore hoped that passage could be found through ice floes at favorable times of the year. Several expeditions set out to find the way, generally with whaling ships, already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes.

One of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the North Pole was that of British naval officer William Edward Parry, who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North. In 1871, the &quot;Polaris&quot; expedition, a U.S. attempt on the Pole led by Charles Francis Hall, ended in disaster. Another British Royal Navy attempt to get to the pole, part of the British Arctic Expedition, by Commander Albert H. Markham reached a then-record 83°20&#x27;26&quot; North in May 1876 before turning back. An 1879–1881 expedition commanded by U.S. Navy officer George W. De Long ended tragically when their ship, the , was crushed by ice. Over half the crew, including De Long, were lost.
In April 1895, the Norwegian explorers Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen struck out for the Pole on skis after leaving Nansen&#x27;s icebound ship &quot;Fram&quot;. The pair reached latitude 86°14′ North before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards, eventually reaching Franz Josef Land.

In 1897, Swedish engineer Salomon August Andrée and two companions tried to reach the North Pole in the hydrogen balloon &quot;Örnen&quot; (&quot;Eagle&quot;), but came down north of Kvitøya, the northeasternmost part of the Svalbard archipelago. They trekked to Kvitøya but died there three months after their crash. In 1930 the remains of this expedition were found by the Norwegian Bratvaag Expedition.

The Italian explorer Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi and Captain Umberto Cagni of the Italian Royal Navy () sailed the converted whaler &quot;Stella Polare&quot; (&quot;Pole Star&quot;) from Norway in 1899. On 11 March 1900, Cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86° 34’ on 25 April, setting a new record by beating Nansen&#x27;s result of 1895 by . Cagni barely managed to return to the camp, remaining there until 23 June. On 16 August, the &quot;Stella Polare&quot; left Rudolf Island heading south and the expedition returned to Norway.

===1900–1940===

The U.S. explorer Frederick Cook claimed to have reached the North Pole on 21 April 1908 with two Inuit men, Ahwelah and Etukishook, but he was unable to produce convincing proof and his claim is not widely accepted.

The conquest of the North Pole was for many years credited to U.S. Navy engineer Robert Peary, who claimed to have reached the Pole on 6 April 1909, accompanied by Matthew Henson and four Inuit men, Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah. However, Peary&#x27;s claim remains highly disputed and controversial. Those who accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in navigation, and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole.

The distances and speeds that Peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people, almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point. Peary&#x27;s account of a journey to the Pole and back while traveling along the direct line – the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing – is contradicted by Henson&#x27;s account of tortuous detours to avoid pressure ridges and open leads.

The British explorer Wally Herbert, initially a supporter of Peary, researched Peary&#x27;s records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer&#x27;s navigational records. He concluded that Peary had not reached the Pole. Support for Peary came again in 2005, however, when British explorer Tom Avery and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary&#x27;s journey with replica wooden sleds and Canadian Eskimo Dog teams, reaching the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours – nearly five hours faster than Peary. However, Avery&#x27;s fastest 5-day march was , significantly short of the claimed by Peary. Avery writes on his web site that &quot;The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from Cape Columbia. Having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole.&quot;

The first claimed flight over the Pole was made on 9 May 1926 by U.S. naval officer Richard E. Byrd and pilot Floyd Bennett in a Fokker tri-motor aircraft. Although verified at the time by a committee of the National Geographic Society, this claim has since been undermined by the 1996 revelation that Byrd&#x27;s long-hidden diary&#x27;s solar sextant data (which the NGS never checked) consistently contradict his June 1926 report&#x27;s parallel data by over . The secret report&#x27;s alleged en-route solar sextant data were inadvertently so impossibly overprecise that he excised all these alleged raw solar observations out of the version of the report finally sent to geographical societies five months later (while the original version was hidden for 70 years), a realization first published in 2000 by the University of Cambridge after scrupulous refereeing.

The first consistent, verified, and scientifically convincing attainment of the Pole was on 12 May 1926, by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen and his U.S. sponsor Lincoln Ellsworth from the airship &quot;Norge&quot;. &quot;Norge&quot;, though Norwegian-owned, was designed and piloted by the Italian Umberto Nobile. The flight started from Svalbard in Norway, and crossed the Arctic Ocean to Alaska. Nobile, with several scientists and crew from the &quot;Norge&quot;, overflew the Pole a second time on 24 May 1928, in the airship &quot;Italia&quot;. The &quot;Italia&quot; crashed on its return from the Pole, with the loss of half the crew.

Another transpolar flight was accomplished in a Tupolev ANT-25 airplane with a crew of Valery Chkalov, Georgy Baydukov and Alexander Belyakov, who flew over the North Pole on 19 June 1937, during their direct flight from the Soviet Union to the USA without any stopover.

=== Ice station ===
In May 1937 the world&#x27;s first North Pole ice station, North Pole-1, was established by Soviet scientists 20 kilometres (13 mi) from the North Pole after the ever first landing of four heavy and one light aircraft onto the ice at the North Pole. The expedition members — oceanographer Pyotr Shirshov, meteorologist Yevgeny Fyodorov, radio operator Ernst Krenkel, and the leader Ivan Papanin — conducted scientific research at the station for the next nine months. By 19 February 1938, when the group was picked up by the ice breakers &quot;Taimyr&quot; and &quot;Murman&quot;, their station had drifted 2850 km to the eastern coast of Greenland.

===1940–2000===
In May 1945 an RAF Lancaster of the &quot;Aries&quot; expedition became the first Commonwealth aircraft to overfly the North Geographic and North Magnetic Poles. The plane was piloted by David Cecil McKinley of the Royal Air Force. It carried an 11-man crew, with Kenneth C. Maclure of the Royal Canadian Air Force in charge of all scientific observations. In 2006, Maclure was honoured with a spot in Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame.

Discounting Peary&#x27;s disputed claim, the first men to set foot at the North Pole were a Soviet party including geophysicists Mikhail Ostrekin and Pavel Senko, oceanographers Mikhail Somov and Pavel Gordienko, and other scientists and flight crew (24 people in total) of Aleksandr Kuznetsov&#x27;s &quot;Sever-2&quot; expedition (March–May 1948). It was organized by the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route. The party flew on three planes (pilots Ivan Cherevichnyy, Vitaly Maslennikov and Ilya Kotov) from Kotelny Island to the North Pole and landed there at 4:44pm (Moscow Time, UTC+04:00) on 23 April 1948. They established a temporary camp and for the next two days conducted scientific observations. On 26 April the expedition flew back to the continent.

Next year, on 9 May 1949 two other Soviet scientists (Vitali Volovich and Andrei Medvedev) became the first people to parachute onto the North Pole. They jumped from a Douglas C-47 Skytrain, registered CCCP H-369.

On 3 May 1952, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Joseph O. Fletcher and Lieutenant William Pershing Benedict, along with scientist Albert P. Crary, landed a modified Douglas C-47 Skytrain at the North Pole. Some Western sources considered this to be the first landing at the Pole until the Soviet landings became widely known.
The United States Navy submarine &quot;USS Nautilus&quot; (SSN-571) crossed the North Pole on 3 August 1958. On 17 March 1959 &quot;USS Skate&quot; (SSN-578) surfaced at the Pole, breaking through the ice above it, becoming the first naval vessel to do so.

The first confirmed surface conquest of the North Pole was accomplished by Ralph Plaisted, Walt Pederson, Gerry Pitzl and Jean Luc Bombardier, who traveled over the ice by snowmobile and arrived on 19 April 1968. The United States Air Force independently confirmed their position.

On 6 April 1969 Wally Herbert and companions Allan Gill, Roy Koerner and Kenneth Hedges of the British Trans-Arctic Expedition became the first men to reach the North Pole on foot (albeit with the aid of dog teams and airdrops). They continued on to complete the first surface crossing of the Arctic Ocean – and by its longest axis, Barrow, Alaska, to Svalbard – a feat that has never been repeated. Because of suggestions (later proven false) of Plaisted&#x27;s use of air transport, some sources classify Herbert&#x27;s expedition as the first confirmed to reach the North Pole over the ice surface by any means. In the 1980s Plaisted&#x27;s pilots Weldy Phipps and Ken Lee signed affidavits asserting that no such airlift was provided. It is also said that Herbert was the first person to reach the pole of inaccessibility.
On 17 August 1977 the Soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker &quot;Arktika&quot; completed the first surface vessel journey to the North Pole.

In 1982 Ranulph Fiennes and Charles R. Burton became the first people to cross the Arctic Ocean in a single season. They departed from Cape Crozier, Ellesmere Island, on 17 February 1982 and arrived at the geographic North Pole on 10 April 1982. They travelled on foot and snowmobile. From the Pole, they travelled towards Svalbard but, due to the unstable nature of the ice, ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days. They were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship &quot;MV Benjamin Bowring&quot; and boarded it on 4 August 1982 at position 80:31N 00:59W. As a result of this journey, which formed a section of the three-year Transglobe Expedition 1979–1982, Fiennes and Burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both North and South Poles, by surface travel alone. This achievement remains unchallenged to this day. The expedition crew included a Jack Russell Terrier named Bothie who became the first dog to visit both poles.

In 1985 Sir Edmund Hillary (the first man to stand on the summit of Mount Everest) and Neil Armstrong (the first man to stand on the moon) landed at the North Pole in a small twin-engined ski plane. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest.

In 1986 Will Steger, with seven teammates, became the first to be confirmed as reaching the Pole by dogsled and without resupply.

USS &quot;Gurnard&quot; (SSN-662) operated in the Arctic Ocean under the polar ice cap from September to November 1984 in company with one of her sister ships, the attack submarine USS &quot;Pintado&quot; (SSN-672). On 12 November 1984 &quot;Gurnard&quot; and &quot;Pintado&quot; became the third pair of submarines to surface together at the North Pole. In March 1990, &quot;Gurnard&quot; deployed to the Arctic region during exercise Ice Ex &#x27;90 and completed only the fourth winter submerged transit of the Bering and Seas. &quot;Gurnard&quot; surfaced at the North Pole on 18 April, in the company of the USS &quot;Seahorse&quot; (SSN-669).

On 6 May 1986 USS &quot;Archerfish&quot; (SSN 678), USS &quot;Ray&quot; (SSN 653) and USS &quot;Hawkbill&quot; (SSN-666) surfaced at the North Pole, the first tri-submarine surfacing at the North Pole.

On 21 April 1987 Shinji Kazama of Japan became the first person to reach the North Pole on a motorcycle.

On 18 May 1987 USS &quot;Billfish&quot; (SSN 676), USS &quot;Sea Devil&quot; (SSN 664) and HMS &quot;Superb&quot; (S 109) surfaced at the North Pole, the first international surfacing at the North Pole.

In 1988 a team of 13 (9 Soviets, 4 Canadians) skied across the arctic from Siberia to northern Canada. One of the Canadians, Richard Weber, became the first person to reach the Pole from both sides of the Arctic Ocean.
On April 16, 1990, a German-Swiss expedition led by a team of the University of Giessen reached the Geographic North Pole for studies on pollution of pack ice, snow and air. Samples taken were analyzed in cooperation with the Geological Survey of Canada and the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research. Further stops for sample collections were on multi-year sea ice at 86°N, at Cape Columbia and Ward Hunt Island.

On 4 May 1990 Børge Ousland and Erling Kagge became the first explorers ever to reach the North Pole unsupported, after a 58-day ski trek from Ellesmere Island in Canada, a distance of 800 km.

On 7 September 1991 the German research vessel &quot;Polarstern&quot; and the Swedish icebreaker &quot;Oden&quot; reached the North Pole as the first conventional powered vessels. Both scientific parties and crew took oceanographic and geological samples and had a common tug of war and a football game on an ice floe. &quot;Polarstern&quot; again reached the pole exactly 10 years later, with the &quot;Healy&quot;.

In 1998, 1999, and 2000, Lada Niva Marshs (special very large wheeled versions made by BRONTO, Lada/Vaz&#x27;s experimental product division) were driven to the North Pole. The 1998 expedition was dropped by parachute and completed the track to the North Pole. The 2000 expedition departed from a Russian research base around 114 km from the Pole and claimed an average speed of 20–15 km/h in an average temperature of −30 °C.

===21st century===

Commercial airliner flights on the polar routes may pass within viewing distance of the North Pole. For example, a flight from Chicago to Beijing may come close as latitude 89° N, though because of prevailing winds return journeys go over the Bering Strait. In recent years journeys to the North Pole by air (landing by helicopter or on a runway prepared on the ice) or by icebreaker have become relatively routine, and are even available to small groups of tourists through adventure holiday companies. Parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the North Pole in recent years. The temporary seasonal Russian camp of Barneo has been established by air a short distance from the Pole annually since 2002, and caters for scientific researchers as well as tourist parties. Trips from the camp to the Pole itself may be arranged overland or by helicopter.

The first attempt at underwater exploration of the North Pole was made on 22 April 1998 by Russian firefighter and diver Andrei Rozhkov with the support of the Diving Club of Moscow State University, but ended in fatality. The next attempted dive at the North Pole was organized the next year by the same diving club, and ended in success on 24 April 1999. The divers were Michael Wolff (Austria), Brett Cormick (UK), and Bob Wass (USA).

In 2005 the United States Navy submarine USS &quot;Charlotte&quot; (SSN-766) surfaced through of ice at the North Pole and spent 18 hours there.

In July 2007 British endurance swimmer Lewis Gordon Pugh completed a swim at the North Pole. His feat, undertaken to highlight the effects of global warming, took place in clear water that had opened up between the ice floes. His later attempt to paddle a kayak to the North Pole in late 2008, following the erroneous prediction of clear water to the Pole, was stymied when his expedition found itself stuck in thick ice after only three days. The expedition was then abandoned.

By September 2007 the North Pole had been visited 66 times by different surface ships: 54 times by Soviet and Russian icebreakers, 4 times by Swedish &quot;Oden&quot;, 3 times by German &quot;Polarstern&quot;, 3 times by USCGC &quot;Healy&quot; and USCGC &quot;Polar Sea&quot;, and once by CCGS &quot;Louis S. St-Laurent&quot; and by Swedish &quot;Vidar Viking&quot;.

====2007 descent to the North Pole seabed====
On 2 August 2007 a Russian scientific expedition Arktika 2007 made the first ever manned descent to the ocean floor at the North Pole, to a depth of , as part of the research programme in support of Russia&#x27;s 2001 extended continental shelf claim to a large swathe of the Arctic Ocean floor. The descent took place in two MIR submersibles and was led by Soviet and Russian polar explorer Artur Chilingarov. In a symbolic act of visitation, the Russian flag was placed on the ocean floor exactly at the Pole.

The expedition was the latest in a series of efforts intended to give Russia a dominant influence in the Arctic according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

====MLAE 2009 Expedition====
In 2009 the Russian Marine Live-Ice Automobile Expedition (MLAE-2009) with Vasily Elagin as a leader and a team of Afanasy Makovnev, Vladimir Obikhod, Alexey Shkrabkin, Sergey Larin, Alexey Ushakov and Nikolay Nikulshin reached the North Pole on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire ATVs. The vehicles, Yemelya-1 and Yemelya-2, were designed by Vasily Elagin, a Russian mountain climber, explorer and engineer. They reached the North Pole on 26 April 2009, 17:30 (Moscow time). The expedition was partly supported by Russian State Aviation. The Russian Book of Records recognized it as the first successful vehicle trip from land to the Geographical North Pole.

====MLAE 2013 Expedition====

On 1 March 2013 the Russian Marine Live-Ice Automobile Expedition (MLAE 2013) with Vasily Elagin as a leader, and a team of Afanasy Makovnev, Vladimir Obikhod, Alexey Shkrabkin, Andrey Vankov, Sergey Isayev and Nikolay Kozlov on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire ATVs—Yemelya-3 and Yemelya-4—started from Golomyanny Island (the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago) to the North Pole across drifting ice of the Arctic Ocean. The vehicles reached the Pole on 6 April and then continued to the Canadian coast. The coast was reached on 30 April 2013 (83°08N, 075°59W Ward Hunt Island), and on 5 May 2013 the expedition finished in Resolute Bay, NU. The way between the Russian borderland (Machtovyi Island of the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago, 80°15N, 097°27E) and the Canadian coast (Ward Hunt Island, 83°08N, 075°59W) took 55 days; it was ~2300 km across drifting ice and about 4000 km in total. The expedition was totally self-dependent and used no external supplies. The expedition was supported by the Russian Geographical Society.

==Day and night==

The sun at the North Pole is continuously above the horizon during the summer and continuously below the horizon during the winter. Sunrise is just before the March equinox (around 20 March); the Sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23½° elevation at the summer solstice (around 21 June), after which time it begins to sink, reaching sunset just after the September equinox (around 23 September). When the Sun is visible in the polar sky, it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon. This circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation (in degrees) above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox. Hence the North and South Poles experience the slowest rates of sunrise and sunset on Earth.

The twilight period that occurs before sunrise and after sunset has three different definitions:

* a civil twilight period of about two weeks;
* a nautical twilight period of about five weeks; and
* an astronomical twilight period of about seven weeks.

These effects are caused by a combination of the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt and its revolution around the Sun. The direction of the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt, as well as its angle relative to the plane of the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun, remains very nearly constant over the course of a year (both change very slowly over long time periods). At northern midsummer the North Pole is facing towards the Sun to its maximum extent. As the year progresses and the Earth moves around the Sun, the North Pole gradually turns away from the Sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the Sun to its maximum extent. A similar sequence is observed at the South Pole, with a six-month time difference.

Since longitude is undefined at the north pole, the exact time is a matter of convention. Polar expeditions use whatever time is most convenient, such as Greenwich Mean Time or the time zone of their origin.

==Climate, sea ice at North Pole==

The North Pole is substantially warmer than the South Pole because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean (which acts as a reservoir of heat), rather than at altitude on a continental land mass. Despite being an ice cap, the northernmost weather station in Greenland has a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;) due to the July and August mean temperatures peaking just above freezing.

Winter temperatures at the northernmost weather station in Greenland can range from about , averaging around , with the North Pole being slightly colder. However, a freak storm caused the temperature to reach for a time at a World Meteorological Organization buoy, located at 87.45°N, on 30 December 2015. It was estimated that the temperature at the North Pole was between during the storm. Summer temperatures (June, July, and August) average around the freezing point (). The highest temperature yet recorded is , much warmer than the South Pole&#x27;s record high of only . A similar spike in temperatures occurred on 15 November 2016 when temperatures hit freezing. Yet again, February 2018 featured a storm so powerful that temperatures at Cape Morris Jesup, the world&#x27;s northernmost weather station in Greenland, reached and spent 24 straight hours above freezing. Meanwhile, the pole itself was estimated to reach a high temperature of . This same temperature of was also recorded at the Hollywood Burbank Airport in Los Angeles at the very same time.

The sea ice at the North Pole is typically around thick, although ice thickness, its spatial extent, and the fraction of open water within the ice pack can vary rapidly and profoundly in response to weather and climate. Studies have shown that the average ice thickness has decreased in recent years. It is likely that global warming has contributed to this, but it is not possible to attribute the recent abrupt decrease in thickness entirely to the observed warming in the Arctic. Reports have also predicted that within a few decades the Arctic Ocean will be entirely free of ice in the summer. This may have significant commercial implications; see &quot;Territorial claims&quot;, below.

The retreat of the Arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming, as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation, and may have serious climate implications by contributing to Arctic cyclone generation.
==Flora and fauna==
Polar bears are believed to travel rarely beyond about 82° North, owing to the scarcity of food, though tracks have been seen in the vicinity of the North Pole, and a 2006 expedition reported sighting a polar bear just from the Pole. The ringed seal has also been seen at the Pole, and Arctic foxes have been observed less than away at 89°40′ N.

Birds seen at or very near the Pole include the snow bunting, northern fulmar and black-legged kittiwake, though some bird sightings may be distorted by the tendency of birds to follow ships and expeditions.

Fish have been seen in the waters at the North Pole, but these are probably few in number. A member of the Russian team that descended to the North Pole seabed in August 2007 reported seeing no sea creatures living there. However, it was later reported that a sea anemone had been scooped up from the seabed mud by the Russian team and that video footage from the dive showed unidentified shrimps and amphipods.

==Territorial claims to the North Pole and Arctic regions==

Currently, under international law, no country owns the North Pole or the region of the Arctic Ocean surrounding it. The five surrounding Arctic countries, Russia, Canada, Norway, Denmark (via Greenland), and the United States, are limited to a exclusive economic zone off their coasts, and the area beyond that is administered by the International Seabed Authority.

Upon ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a country has 10 years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200-mile exclusive economic zone. If validated, such a claim gives the claimant state rights to what may be on or beneath the sea bottom within the claimed zone. Norway (ratified the convention in 1996), Russia (ratified in 1997), Canada (ratified in 2003) and Denmark (ratified in 2004) have all launched projects to base claims that certain areas of Arctic continental shelves should be subject to their sole sovereign exploitation.

In 1907 Canada invoked the &quot;sector principle&quot; to claim sovereignty over a sector stretching from its coasts to the North Pole. This claim has not been relinquished, but was not consistently pressed until 2013.

==Cultural associations==
In some children&#x27;s Christmas legends and Western folklore, the geographic North Pole is described as the location of Santa Claus&#x27; workshop and residence. Canada Post has assigned postal code H0H 0H0 to the North Pole (referring to Santa&#x27;s traditional exclamation of &quot;Ho ho ho!&quot;).

This association reflects an age-old esoteric mythology of Hyperborea that posits the North Pole, the otherworldly world-axis, as the abode of God and superhuman beings.

As Henry Corbin has documented, the North Pole plays a key part in the cultural worldview of Sufism and Iranian mysticism. &quot;The Orient sought by the mystic, the Orient that cannot be located on our maps, is in the direction of the north, beyond the north.&quot;.

In Mandaean cosmology, the North Pole and Polaris are considered to be auspicious, since they are associated with the World of Light. Mandaeans face north when praying, and temples are also oriented towards the north. On the contrary, South is associated with the World of Darkness.

Owing to its remoteness, the Pole is sometimes identified with a mysterious mountain of ancient Iranian tradition called Mount Qaf (Jabal Qaf), the &quot;farthest point of the earth&quot;. According to certain authors, the Jabal Qaf of Muslim cosmology is a version of Rupes Nigra, a mountain whose ascent, like Dante&#x27;s climbing of the Mountain of Purgatory, represents the pilgrim&#x27;s progress through spiritual states. In Iranian theosophy, the heavenly Pole, the focal point of the spiritual ascent, acts as a magnet to draw beings to its &quot;palaces ablaze with immaterial matter.&quot;

<text>The nanometre (international spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: nm), or nanometer (American spelling), is a unit of length in the International System of Units (SI), equal to one billionth (short scale) or one thousand million (long scale) of a meter (0.000000001 m) and to 1000 picometres. One nanometre can be expressed in scientific notation as 1 × 10−9 m and as  m.

==History==
The nanometre was formerly known as the &quot;&quot;millimicrometre&quot; – or, more commonly, the &quot;millimicron&quot;&quot; for short – since it is of a micrometer. It was often denoted by the symbol &quot;mμ&quot; or, more rarely, as &quot;μμ&quot; (however, &quot;μμ&quot; should refer to a &quot;millionth&quot; of a micron).

==Etymology==
The name combines the SI prefix &quot;nano-&quot; (from the Ancient Greek , &#x27;, &quot;dwarf&quot;) with the parent unit name &quot;metre&quot; (from Greek , &#x27;, &quot;unit of measurement&quot;).

==Usage==
Nanotechnologies are based on physical processes which occur on a scale of nanometres (see nanoscopic scale).

The nanometre is often used to express dimensions on an atomic scale: the diameter of a helium atom, for example, is about 0.06 nm, and that of a ribosome is about 20 nm. The nanometre is also commonly used to specify the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation near the visible part of the spectrum: visible light ranges from around 400 to 700 nm. The ångström, which is equal to 0.1 nm, was formerly used for these purposes.

Since the late 1980s, in usages such as the 32 nm and the 22 nm semiconductor node, it has also been used to describe typical feature sizes in successive generations of the ITRS Roadmap for miniaturized semiconductor device fabrication in the semiconductor industry.

<text>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent U.S. government investigative agency responsible for civil transportation accident investigation. In this role, the NTSB investigates and reports on aviation accidents and incidents, certain types of highway crashes, ship and marine accidents, pipeline incidents, bridge failures, and railroad accidents. The NTSB is also in charge of investigating cases of hazardous materials releases that occur during transportation. The agency is based in Washington, D.C. It has three regional offices, located in Anchorage, Alaska; Aurora, Colorado; and Federal Way, Washington. The agency also operated a national training center at its Ashburn facility.

==History==
The origin of the NTSB was in the Air Commerce Act of 1926, which assigned the United States Department of Commerce responsibility for investigating domestic aviation accidents. Before the NTSB, the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s (FAA; at the time the CAA/Civil Aviation Authority) independence was questioned as it was investigating itself and would be biased to find external faults, coalescing with the 1931 crash killing Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne and the 1935 crash that killed Senator Bronson Cutting. The US&#x27;s first &quot;independent&quot; &quot;Air Safety Board&quot; was established in 1938: it lasted only fourteen months. In 1940, this authority was transferred to the Civil Aeronautics Board&#x27;s newly formed Bureau of Aviation Safety.

On April 1, 1967, the Congress created a separate cabinet-level Department of Transportation, which among other things, established the Federal Aviation Administration as an agency under the DOT. At the same time, the NTSB was established as an independent agency which absorbed the Bureau of Aviation Safety&#x27;s responsibilities. However, from 1967 to 1975, the NTSB reported to the DOT for administrative purposes, while conducting investigations into the Federal Aviation Administration, also a DOT agency.

To avoid any conflict, the Congress passed the Independent Safety Board Act, and on April 1, 1975, the NTSB became a fully independent agency. , the NTSB has investigated over 140,000 aviation incidents and several thousand surface transportation incidents.

==Organization==
Formally, the &quot;National Transportation Safety Board&quot; refers to a five-manager investigative board whose five members are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. Board members may continue to serve until a successor is confirmed and takes office. No more than three of the five members may be from the same political party. One of the five board members is nominated as the chair by the President and then approved by the Senate for a fixed three-year term; another is designated as vice-chair for a fixed three-year term and who becomes acting chair when there is no formal chair. This board is authorized by Congress under Chapter 11, Title 49 of the United States Code to investigate civil aviation, highway, marine, pipeline, and railroad accidents and incidents. This five-member board is authorized to establish and manage separate sub-offices for highway, marine, aviation, railroad, pipeline, and hazardous materials investigations.

Since its creation, the NTSB&#x27;s primary mission has been &quot;to determine the probable cause of transportation accidents and incidents and to formulate safety recommendations to improve transportation safety (in the USA)&quot;. Based on the results of investigations within its jurisdiction, the NTSB issues formal safety recommendations to agencies and institutions with the power to implement those recommendations. The NTSB considers safety recommendations to be its primary tool for preventing future civil transportation accidents. However, the NTSB does not have the authority to enforce its safety recommendations.

==Accident and incident investigations==

The NTSB is the lead agency in investigating a civil transportation accident or incident within its sphere. An investigation of a major accident within the United States typically starts with the creation of a &quot;go team&quot;, composed of specialists in fields relating to the incident who are rapidly deployed to the incident location. The &quot;go team&quot; can have as few as three people or as many as a dozen, depending on the nature of the incident. The agency may then hold public hearings on the issue following the investigation. Ultimately, it will publish a final report which may include safety recommendations based on its findings. The NTSB has no legal authority to implement or impose its recommendations. Its recommendations are often implemented by regulators at the federal or state level or by individual transportation companies.

If the structure of an aircraft remains largely intact during a crash and does not transmit gravitational forces to occupants that a human cannot tolerate, the NTSB deems it a survivable incident. Humans can generally tolerate 4 to 5 G&#x27;s.

===Jurisdiction over investigations===
;Aviation: The NTSB has primary authority to investigate every civil aviation accident in the United States; the agency is also authorized to conduct investigations involving both civilian and military aircraft &quot;with the participation of appropriate military authorities&quot;. Aviation includes certain commercial space accidents. For certain accidents, due to resource limitations, the Board will ask the FAA to collect the factual information at the scene of the accident; the NTSB bases its report on that information.
;Surface Transportation: The NTSB has the authority to investigate all highway accidents and incidents, including incidents at railway grade crossings, &quot;in cooperation with a State&quot;. The NTSB has primary jurisdiction over railway accidents and incidents which result in death or significant property damage, or which involve a passenger train.
;Marine: For marine investigations, jurisdiction into investigations is divided between the NTSB and the U.S. Coast Guard. The division of investigative jurisdiction and responsibilities is prescribed in a detailed Memorandum of Understanding between the two agencies.
;Pipeline: The NTSB has primary jurisdiction over pipeline incidents (often the result of third-party excavation damage) which involve &quot;a fatality, substantial property damage, or significant injury to the environment&quot;. 
;Assistance to criminal investigations: The NTSB has primary jurisdiction over civil transportation investigations, not criminal ones. If the Attorney General declares the case to be linked to a criminal act, the NTSB must relinquish control of the investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The NTSB may still provide technical support to the FBI in such investigations. In two high-profile examples, the NTSB sent aviation accident investigators with knowledge of aircraft structures and flight recorders to assist the FBI&#x27;s criminal investigation into the murder-suicide of Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 in 1987, and the September 11, 2001, attacks fourteen years later.
;Assistance to other domestic agencies: In addition to assisting the Department of Justice in criminal investigations, the NTSB has also assisted the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in its investigations of both the &quot;Challenger&quot; and the &quot;Columbia&quot; Space Shuttle disasters. The NTSB can also assist the U.S. military in investigating military incidents within the realm of the NTSB&#x27;s expertise, such as the crash of an Air Force transport plane in former Yugoslavia that killed more than 30 Americans, including Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.
;Assistance to foreign governments: The NTSB may assist in incident or accident investigations outside the United States under certain circumstances. These may include accidents or incidents involving American-registered or American-owned civil aircraft or aircraft with U.S.-manufactured components in foreign air space. Officially, NTSB employees are prohibited from releasing information about &quot;another country&#x27;s investigation&quot;, although this has happened in the past.

===Use of the &quot;party system&quot;===
To conduct its investigations, the NTSB operates under the &quot;party system&quot;, which utilizes the support and participation of industry and labor representatives with expertise or technical knowledge specifically useful to its investigation. The NTSB may invite these individuals or organizations to become parties to the investigation and participate under the supervision of the NTSB. The NTSB has discretion over which organizations it allows to participate. Only individuals with relevant technical expertise can represent an organization in an investigation, and attorneys and insurance investigators are prohibited by law from participating.

The NTSB considers the party system crucial to the investigative process, as it provides the NTSB with access to individuals with specialized expertise or knowledge relevant to a particular investigation. However, the use of the party system is not without controversy. The NTSB invited Boeing to participate as a party to the investigation of the crash of TWA Flight 800, a Boeing 747, in 1996. While the NTSB relied on Boeing&#x27;s sharing of expertise, it was later determined that Boeing had withheld a study of military versions of the 747 that investigated flammable vapor combustion in the center fuel tank. Boeing had told the NTSB that it had no studies proving or disproving the vapor combustion theory. In response to political pressure after the Boeing incident, the NTSB commissioned the nonprofit Rand Corporation to conduct an independent study of the NTSB&#x27;s aircraft investigation process.

In 2000, Rand published its report, which concluded that the party system is &quot;a key component of the NTSB investigative process&quot; and that participant parties &quot;are uniquely able to provide essential information about aircraft design and manufacture, airline operations, or functioning of [the National Airspace System] that simply cannot be obtained elsewhere&quot;. However, Rand also found conflicts of interest inherent in the party system, &quot;may, in some instances, threaten the integrity of the NTSB investigative process&quot;. The Rand study recommended that the NTSB reduce its reliance on party representatives and make greater use of independent investigators, including from NASA, the Department of Defense, government research laboratories, and universities. , the NTSB has not adopted these recommendations and instead continues to rely on the party system.

==Safety recommendations adopted==
, the NTSB has issued about 14,000 safety recommendations in its history, 73 percent of which have been adopted in whole or in part by the entities to which they were directed. From 1990 to 2023, the NTSB annually published a &quot;Most Wanted List&quot;, which highlighted safety recommendations that the NTSB believed would provide the most significant — and sometimes immediate — benefit to the traveling public.

Among transportation safety improvements brought about or inspired by NTSB recommendations:
* Aviation: Mid-air collision avoidance technology, ground proximity warning systems, airborne wind shear detection and alert systems, smoke detectors in lavatories and fuel tank inerting.
* Highway: Graduated drivers license laws for young drivers, age-21 drinking laws, smart airbag technology, center high-mounted stop lights, commercial drivers licenses, and improved school bus construction standards.
* Rail: Positive train control, improved emergency exits for passenger rail cars, and double-shelf couplers for hazardous material rail cars.
* Marine: Recreational boating safety, improved fire safety on cruise ships, and lifesaving devices on fishing vessels.
* Pipeline: Excavation damage prevention, pipe corrosion protection, and remote shutoff valves.
* Multimodal: Alcohol and drug testing in all modes of transportation.

==Other responsibilities==
A less well-known responsibility of the NTSB is that it serves as a court of appeals for airmen, aircraft mechanics, certificated aviation-related companies, and mariners who have their licenses suspended or revoked by the FAA or the Coast Guard. The NTSB employs administrative law judges who initially hear all appeals, and the administrative law judge&#x27;s ruling may be appealed to the five-member Board. The Board&#x27;s determinations may be appealed to the federal court system by the losing party, whether it is the individual or company, on the one hand, or the FAA or the Coast Guard, on the other. However, from &quot;Ferguson v. NTSB&quot;, the NTSB&#x27;s determinations are not overturned by the federal courts unless the NTSB abused its discretion or its determination is wholly unsupported by the evidence.

The Safety Board maintains a training academy in Ashburn, Virginia, where it conducts courses for its employees and professionals in other government agencies, foreign governments or private companies, in areas such as general accident investigation, specific elements of investigations like survival factors or human performance, or related matters like family affairs or media relations. The facility houses for training purposes the reconstruction of more than 90 feet of the TWA Flight 800 Boeing 747, which was recovered from the Atlantic Ocean after it crashed on July 17, 1996, following a fuel tank explosion.

On February 22, 2021, the NTSB announced that the TWA Flight 800 recreation would be decommissioned on July 7, 2021. This decision comes as the lease for the Ashburn training center expires shortly. The NTSB indicated it is moving away from large-scale reconstructions like with TWA Flight 800 and towards using 3D scans to reconstruct accidents. Under an agreement made with the victims&#x27; families, when the reconstruction was retained as a training tool, the reconstruction was not allowed to be used as a public exhibit or put on display. For this reason, the NTSB is planning to dismantle and destroy the reconstruction.

<doc id="21843" wikidata="Q271794" url="?curid=21843" title="Nucleosome">
<text>A nucleosome is the basic structural unit of DNA packaging in eukaryotes. The structure of a nucleosome consists of a segment of DNA wound around eight histone proteins and resembles thread wrapped around a spool. The nucleosome is the fundamental subunit of chromatin. Each nucleosome is composed of a little less than two turns of DNA wrapped around a set of eight proteins called histones, which are known as a histone octamer. Each histone octamer is composed of two copies each of the histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.

DNA must be compacted into nucleosomes to fit within the cell nucleus. In addition to nucleosome wrapping, eukaryotic chromatin is further compacted by being folded into a series of more complex structures, eventually forming a chromosome. Each human cell contains about 30 million nucleosomes.

Nucleosomes are thought to carry epigenetically inherited information in the form of covalent modifications of their core histones. Nucleosome positions in the genome are not random, and it is important to know where each nucleosome is located because this determines the accessibility of the DNA to regulatory proteins.

Nucleosomes were first observed as particles in the electron microscope by Don and Ada Olins in 1974, and their existence and structure (as histone octamers surrounded by approximately 200 base pairs of DNA) were proposed by Roger Kornberg. The role of the nucleosome as a regulator of transcription was demonstrated by Lorch et al. in vitro in 1987 and by Han and Grunstein and Clark-Adams et al. in vivo in 1988.

The nucleosome core particle consists of approximately 146 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped in 1.67 left-handed superhelical turns around a histone octamer, consisting of 2 copies each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Core particles are connected by stretches of linker DNA, which can be up to about 80 bp long. Technically, a nucleosome is defined as the core particle plus one of these linker regions; however the word is often synonymous with the core particle. Genome-wide nucleosome positioning maps are now available for many model organisms and human cells.

Linker histones such as H1 and its isoforms are involved in chromatin compaction and sit at the base of the nucleosome near the DNA entry and exit binding to the linker region of the DNA. Non-condensed nucleosomes without the linker histone resemble &quot;beads on a string of DNA&quot; under an electron microscope.

In contrast to most eukaryotic cells, mature sperm cells largely use protamines to package their genomic DNA, most likely to achieve an even higher packaging ratio. Histone equivalents and a simplified chromatin structure have also been found in Archaea, suggesting that eukaryotes are not the only organisms that use nucleosomes.

== Structure ==
===Structure of the core particle===
====Overview====
Pioneering structural studies in the 1980s by Aaron Klug&#x27;s group provided the first evidence that an octamer of histone proteins wraps DNA around itself in about 1.7 turns of a left-handed superhelix. In 1997 the first near atomic resolution crystal structure of the nucleosome was solved by the Richmond group, showing the most important details of the particle. The human alpha satellite palindromic DNA critical to achieving the 1997 nucleosome crystal structure was developed by the Bunick group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The structures of over 20 different nucleosome core particles have been solved to date, including those containing histone variants and histones from different species. The structure of the nucleosome core particle is remarkably conserved, and even a change of over 100 residues between frog and yeast histones results in electron density maps with an overall root mean square deviation of only 1.6Å.

====The nucleosome core particle (NCP)====
The nucleosome core particle (shown in the figure) consists of about 146 base pair of DNA wrapped in 1.67 left-handed superhelical turns around the histone octamer, consisting of 2 copies each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Adjacent nucleosomes are joined by a stretch of free DNA termed linker DNA (which varies from 10 - 80 bp in length depending on species and tissue type).The whole structure generates a cylinder of diameter 11 nm and a height of 5.5 nm.

Nucleosome core particles are observed when chromatin in interphase is treated to cause the chromatin to unfold partially. The resulting image, via an electron microscope, is &quot;beads on a string&quot;. The string is the DNA, while each bead in the nucleosome is a core particle. The nucleosome core particle is composed of DNA and histone proteins.

Partial DNAse digestion of chromatin reveals its nucleosome structure. Because DNA portions of nucleosome core particles are less accessible for DNAse than linking sections, DNA gets digested into fragments of lengths equal to multiplicity of distance between nucleosomes (180, 360, 540 base pairs etc.). Hence a very characteristic pattern similar to a ladder is visible during gel electrophoresis of that DNA. Such digestion can occur also under natural conditions during apoptosis (&quot;cell suicide&quot; or programmed cell death), because autodestruction of DNA typically is its role.

=====Protein interactions within the nucleosome=====
The core histone proteins contains a characteristic structural motif termed the &quot;histone fold&quot;, which consists of three alpha-helices (α1-3) separated by two loops (L1-2). In solution, the histones form H2A-H2B heterodimers and H3-H4 heterotetramers. Histones dimerise about their long α2 helices in an anti-parallel orientation, and, in the case of H3 and H4, two such dimers form a 4-helix bundle stabilised by extensive H3-H3&#x27; interaction. The H2A/H2B dimer binds onto the H3/H4 tetramer due to interactions between H4 and H2B, which include the formation of a hydrophobic cluster.
The histone octamer is formed by a central H3/H4 tetramer sandwiched between two H2A/H2B dimers. Due to the highly basic charge of all four core histones, the histone octamer is stable only in the presence of DNA or very high salt concentrations.

=====Histone - DNA interactions=====
The nucleosome contains over 120 direct protein-DNA interactions and several hundred water-mediated ones. Direct protein - DNA interactions are not spread evenly about the octamer surface but rather located at discrete sites. These are due to the formation of two types of DNA binding sites within the octamer; the α1α1 site, which uses the α1 helix from two adjacent histones, and the L1L2 site formed by the L1 and L2 loops. Salt links and hydrogen bonding between both side-chain basic and hydroxyl groups and main-chain amides with the DNA backbone phosphates form the bulk of interactions with the DNA. This is important, given that the ubiquitous distribution of nucleosomes along genomes requires it to be a non-sequence-specific DNA-binding factor. Although nucleosomes tend to prefer some DNA sequences over others, they are capable of binding practically to any sequence, which is thought to be due to the flexibility in the formation of these water-mediated interactions. In addition, non-polar interactions are made between protein side-chains and the deoxyribose groups, and an arginine side-chain intercalates into the DNA minor groove at all 14 sites where it faces the octamer surface.
The distribution and strength of DNA-binding sites about the octamer surface distorts the DNA within the nucleosome core. The DNA is non-uniformly bent and also contains twist defects. The twist of free B-form DNA in solution is 10.5 bp per turn. However, the overall twist of nucleosomal DNA is only 10.2 bp per turn, varying from a value of 9.4 to 10.9 bp per turn.

====Histone tail domains====
The histone tail extensions constitute up to 30% by mass of histones, but are not visible in the crystal structures of nucleosomes due to their high intrinsic flexibility, and have been thought to be largely unstructured. The N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H2B pass through a channel formed by the minor grooves of the two DNA strands, protruding from the DNA every 20 bp. The N-terminal tail of histone H4, on the other hand, has a region of highly basic amino acids (16–25), which, in the crystal structure, forms an interaction with the highly acidic surface region of a H2A-H2B dimer of another nucleosome, being potentially relevant for the higher-order structure of nucleosomes. This interaction is thought to occur under physiological conditions also, and suggests that acetylation of the H4 tail distorts the higher-order structure of chromatin.

===Higher order structure===

The organization of the DNA that is achieved by the nucleosome cannot fully explain the packaging of DNA observed in the cell nucleus. Further compaction of chromatin into the cell nucleus is necessary, but it is not yet well understood. The current understanding is that repeating nucleosomes with intervening &quot;linker&quot; DNA form a &quot;10-nm-fiber&quot;, described as &quot;beads on a string&quot;, and have a packing ratio of about five to ten. A chain of nucleosomes can be arranged in a &quot;30 nm fiber&quot;, a compacted structure with a packing ratio of ~50 and whose formation is dependent on the presence of the H1 histone.

A crystal structure of a tetranucleosome has been presented and used to build up a proposed structure of the 30 nm fiber as a two-start helix.
There is still a certain amount of contention regarding this model, as it is incompatible with recent electron microscopy data. Beyond this, the structure of chromatin is poorly understood, but it is classically suggested that the 30 nm fiber is arranged into loops along a central protein scaffold to form transcriptionally active euchromatin. Further compaction leads to transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.

==Dynamics==
Although the nucleosome is a very stable protein-DNA complex, it is not static and has been shown to undergo a number of different structural re-arrangements including nucleosome sliding and DNA site exposure. Depending on the context, nucleosomes can inhibit or facilitate transcription factor binding. Nucleosome positions are controlled by three major contributions: First, the intrinsic binding affinity of the histone octamer depends on the DNA sequence. Second, the nucleosome can be displaced or recruited by the competitive or cooperative binding of other protein factors. Third, the nucleosome may be actively translocated by ATP-dependent remodeling complexes.

===Nucleosome sliding===
When incubated thermally, nucleosomes reconstituted onto the 5S DNA positioning sequence were able to reposition themselves translationally onto adjacent sequences. This repositioning does not require disruption of the histone octamer but is consistent with nucleosomes being able to &quot;slide&quot; along the DNA &quot;in cis&quot;. CTCF binding sites act as nucleosome positioning anchors so that, when used to align various genomic signals, multiple flanking nucleosomes can be readily identified. Although nucleosomes are intrinsically mobile, eukaryotes have evolved a large family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes to alter chromatin structure, many of which do so via nucleosome sliding. Nucleosome sliding is one of the possible mechanism for large scale tissue specific expression of genes. The transcription start site for genes expressed in a particular tissue, are nucleosome depleted while, the same set of genes in other tissue where they are not expressed, are nucleosome bound.

===DNA site exposure===
Nucleosomal DNA is in equilibrium between a wrapped and unwrapped state. DNA within the nucleosome remains fully wrapped for only 250 ms before it is unwrapped for 10-50 ms and then rapidly rewrapped, as measured using time-resolved FRET. This implies that DNA does not need to be actively dissociated from the nucleosome but that there is a significant fraction of time during which it is fully accessible. Introducing a DNA-binding sequence within the nucleosome increases the accessibility of adjacent regions of DNA when bound. 

This propensity for DNA within the nucleosome to &quot;breathe&quot; has important functional consequences for all DNA-binding proteins that operate in a chromatin environment. In particular, the dynamic breathing of nucleosomes plays an important role in restricting the advancement of RNA polymerase II during transcription elongation.

=== Nucleosome free region ===
Promoters of active genes have nucleosome free regions (NFR). This allows for promoter DNA accessibility to various proteins, such as transcription factors. Nucleosome free region typically spans for 200 nucleotides in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; Well-positioned nucleosomes form boundaries of NFR. These nucleosomes are called +1-nucleosome and −1-nucleosome and are located at canonical distances downstream and upstream, respectively, from transcription start site. +1-nucleosome and several downstream nucleosomes also tend to incorporate H2A.Z histone variant.

==Modulating nucleosome structure==
Eukaryotic genomes are ubiquitously associated into chromatin; however, cells must spatially and temporally regulate specific loci independently of bulk chromatin. In order to achieve the high level of control required to co-ordinate nuclear processes such as DNA replication, repair, and transcription, cells have developed a variety of means to locally and specifically modulate chromatin structure and function. This can involve covalent modification of histones, the incorporation of histone variants, and non-covalent remodelling by ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes.

===Histone post-translational modifications===
Since they were discovered in the mid-1960s, histone modifications have been predicted to affect transcription. The fact that most of the early post-translational modifications found were concentrated within the tail extensions that protrude from the nucleosome core lead to two main theories regarding the mechanism of histone modification. The first of the theories suggested that they may affect electrostatic interactions between the histone tails and DNA to &quot;loosen&quot; chromatin structure. Later it was proposed that combinations of these modifications may create binding epitopes with which to recruit other proteins. Recently, given that more modifications have been found in the structured regions of histones, it has been put forward that these modifications may affect histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions within the nucleosome core. Modifications (such as acetylation or phosphorylation) that lower the charge of the globular histone core are predicted to &quot;loosen&quot; core-DNA association; the strength of the effect depends on location of the modification within the core.
Some modifications have been shown to be correlated with gene silencing; others seem to be correlated with gene activation. Common modifications include acetylation, methylation, or ubiquitination of lysine; methylation of arginine; and phosphorylation of serine. The information stored in this way is considered epigenetic, since it is not encoded in the DNA but is still inherited to daughter cells. The maintenance of a repressed or activated status of a gene is often necessary for cellular differentiation.

===Histone variants===
Although histones are remarkably conserved throughout evolution, several variant forms have been identified. This diversification of histone function is restricted to H2A and H3, with H2B and H4 being mostly invariant. H2A can be replaced by H2AZ (which leads to reduced nucleosome stability) or H2AX (which is associated with DNA repair and T cell differentiation), whereas the inactive X chromosomes in mammals are enriched in macroH2A. H3 can be replaced by H3.3 (which correlates with activate genes and regulatory elements) and in centromeres H3 is replaced by CENPA.

===ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling===
A number of distinct reactions are associated with the term ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. Remodeling enzymes have been shown to slide nucleosomes along DNA, disrupt histone-DNA contacts to the extent of destabilizing the H2A/H2B dimer and to generate negative superhelical torsion in DNA and chromatin. Recently, the Swr1 remodeling enzyme has been shown to introduce the variant histone H2A.Z into nucleosomes. At present, it is not clear if all of these represent distinct reactions or merely alternative outcomes of a common mechanism. What is shared between all, and indeed the hallmark of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, is that they all result in altered DNA accessibility.

Studies looking at gene activation &quot;in vivo&quot; and, more astonishingly, remodeling &quot;in vitro&quot; have revealed that chromatin remodeling events and transcription-factor binding are cyclical and periodic in nature. While the consequences of this for the reaction mechanism of chromatin remodeling are not known, the dynamic nature of the system may allow it to respond faster to external stimuli. A recent study indicates that nucleosome positions change significantly during mouse embryonic stem cell development, and these changes are related to binding of developmental transcription factors.

===Dynamic nucleosome remodelling across the Yeast genome===
Studies in 2007 have catalogued nucleosome positions in yeast and shown that nucleosomes are depleted in promoter regions and origins of replication.
About 80% of the yeast genome appears to be covered by nucleosomes and the pattern of nucleosome positioning clearly relates to DNA regions that regulate transcription, regions that are transcribed and regions that initiate DNA replication. Most recently, a new study examined &quot;dynamic changes&quot; in nucleosome repositioning during a global transcriptional reprogramming event to elucidate the effects on nucleosome displacement during genome-wide transcriptional changes in yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;). The results suggested that nucleosomes that were localized to promoter regions are displaced in response to stress (like heat shock). In addition, the removal of nucleosomes usually corresponded to transcriptional activation and the replacement of nucleosomes usually corresponded to transcriptional repression, presumably because transcription factor binding sites became more or less accessible, respectively. In general, only one or two nucleosomes were repositioned at the promoter to effect these transcriptional changes. However, even in chromosomal regions that were not associated with transcriptional changes, nucleosome repositioning was observed, suggesting that the covering and uncovering of transcriptional DNA does not necessarily produce a transcriptional event. After transcription, the rDNA region has to protected from any damage, it suggested HMGB proteins play a major role in protecting the nucleosome free region.

=== DNA Twist Defects ===
DNA twist defects are when the addition of one or a few base pairs from one DNA segment are transferred to the next segment resulting in a change of the DNA twist. This will not only change the twist of the DNA but it will also change the length. This twist defect eventually moves around the nucleosome through the transferring of the base pair, this means DNA twists can cause nucleosome sliding. Nucleosome crystal structures have shown that superhelix location 2 and 5 on the nucleosome are commonly found to be where DNA twist defects occur as these are common remodeler binding sites. There are a variety of chromatin remodelers but all share the existence of an ATPase motor which facilitates chromatin sliding on DNA through the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. ATPase has an open and closed state. When the ATPase motor is changing from open and closed states, the DNA duplex changes geometry and exhibits base pair tilting. The initiation of the twist defects via the ATPase motor causes tension to accumulate around the remodeler site. The tension is released when the sliding of DNA has been completed throughout the nucleosome via the spread of two twist defects (one on each strand) in opposite directions.

==Nucleosome assembly &quot;in vitro&quot;==

Nucleosomes can be assembled &quot;in vitro&quot; by either using purified native or recombinant histones. One standard technique of loading the DNA around the histones involves the use of salt dialysis. A reaction consisting of the histone octamers and a naked DNA template can be incubated together at a salt concentration of 2 M. By steadily decreasing the salt concentration, the DNA will equilibrate to a position where it is wrapped around the histone octamers, forming nucleosomes. In appropriate conditions, this reconstitution process allows for the nucleosome positioning affinity of a given sequence to be mapped experimentally.

=== Disulfide crosslinked nucleosome core particles ===
A recent advance in the production of nucleosome core particles with enhanced stability involves site-specific disulfide crosslinks. Two different crosslinks can be introduced into the nucleosome core particle. A first one crosslinks the two copies of H2A via an introduced cysteine (N38C) resulting in histone octamer which is stable against H2A/H2B dimer loss during nucleosome reconstitution. A second crosslink can be introduced between the H3 N-terminal histone tail and the nucleosome DNA ends via an incorporated convertible nucleotide. The DNA-histone octamer crosslink stabilizes the nucleosome core particle against DNA dissociation at very low particle concentrations and at elevated salt concentrations.

== Nucleosome assembly &quot; in vivo &quot; ==
Nucleosomes are the basic packing unit of genomic DNA built from histone proteins around which DNA is coiled. They serve as a scaffold for formation of higher order chromatin structure as well as for a layer of regulatory control of gene expression. Nucleosomes are quickly assembled onto newly synthesized DNA behind the replication fork.

=== H3 and H4 ===
Histones H3 and H4 from disassembled old nucleosomes are kept in the vicinity and randomly distributed on the newly synthesized DNA. They are assembled by the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) complex, which consists of three subunits (p150, p60, and p48). Newly synthesized H3 and H4 are assembled by the replication coupling assembly factor (RCAF). RCAF contains the subunit Asf1, which binds to newly synthesized H3 and H4 proteins. The old H3 and H4 proteins retain their chemical modifications which contributes to the passing down of the epigenetic signature. The newly synthesized H3 and H4 proteins are gradually acetylated at different lysine residues as part of the chromatin maturation process. It is also thought that the old H3 and H4 proteins in the new nucleosomes recruit histone modifying enzymes that mark the new histones, contributing to epigenetic memory.

=== H2A and H2B ===
In contrast to old H3 and H4, the old H2A and H2B histone proteins are released and degraded; therefore, newly assembled H2A and H2B proteins are incorporated into new nucleosomes. H2A and H2B are assembled into dimers which are then loaded onto nucleosomes by the nucleosome assembly protein-1 (NAP-1) which also assists with nucleosome sliding. The nucleosomes are also spaced by ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling complexes containing enzymes such as Isw1 Ino80, and Chd1, and subsequently assembled into higher order structure.
