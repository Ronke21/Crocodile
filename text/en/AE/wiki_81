<text>Primates is an order of mammals, which is further divided into the strepsirrhines, which include lemurs, galagos, and lorisids; and the haplorhines, which include tarsiers and simians (monkeys and apes). Primates arose 74–63 million years ago first from small terrestrial mammals, which adapted for life in tropical forests: many primate characteristics represent adaptations to the challenging environment among tree tops, including large brain sizes, binocular vision, color vision, vocalizations, shoulder girdles allowing a large degree of movement in the upper limbs, and opposable thumbs (in most but not all) that enable better grasping and dexterity. Primates range in size from Madame Berthe&#x27;s mouse lemur, which weighs , to the eastern gorilla, weighing over . There are 376–524 species of living primates, depending on which classification is used. New primate species continue to be discovered: over 25 species were described in the 2000s, 36 in the 2010s, and six in the 2020s.

Primates have large brains (relative to body size) compared to other mammals, as well as an increased reliance on visual acuity at the expense of the sense of smell, which is the dominant sensory system in most mammals. These features are more developed in monkeys and apes, and noticeably less so in lorises and lemurs. Some primates, including gorillas, humans and baboons, are primarily ground-dwelling rather than arboreal, but all species have adaptations for climbing trees. Arboreal locomotion techniques used include leaping from tree to tree and swinging between branches of trees (brachiation); terrestrial locomotion techniques include walking on two hindlimbs (bipedalism) and modified walking on four limbs (quadrupedalism) via knuckle-walking.

Primates are among the most social of all animals, forming pairs or family groups, uni-male harems, and multi-male/multi-female groups. Non-human primates have at least four types of social systems, many defined by the amount of movement by adolescent females between groups. Primates have slower rates of development than other similarly sized mammals, reach maturity later, and have longer lifespans. Primates are also the most cognitively advanced animals, with humans (genus &quot;Homo&quot;) capable of creating complex languages and sophisticated civilizations, and non-human primates are recorded to use tools. They may communicate using facial and hand gestures, smells and vocalizations.

Close interactions between humans and non-human primates (NHPs) can create opportunities for the transmission of zoonotic diseases, especially virus diseases including herpes, measles, ebola, rabies and hepatitis. Thousands of non-human primates are used in research around the world because of their psychological and physiological similarity to humans. About 60% of primate species are threatened with extinction. Common threats include deforestation, forest fragmentation, monkey drives, and primate hunting for use in medicines, as pets, and for food. Large-scale tropical forest clearing for agriculture most threatens primates.

==Etymology==
The English name &quot;&quot; is derived from Old French or French , from a noun use of Latin , from (&#x27;prime, first rank&#x27;). The name was given by Carl Linnaeus because he thought this the &quot;highest&quot; order of animals. The relationships among the different groups of primates were not clearly understood until relatively recently, so the commonly used terms are somewhat confused. For example, &quot;ape&quot; has been used either as an alternative for &quot;monkey&quot; or for any tailless, relatively human-like primate.

Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark was one of the primatologists who developed the idea of trends in primate evolution and the methodology of arranging the living members of an order into an &quot;ascending series&quot; leading to humans. Commonly used names for groups of primates such as &quot;prosimians&quot;, &quot;monkeys&quot;, &quot;lesser apes&quot;, and &quot;great apes&quot; reflect this methodology. According to our current understanding of the evolutionary history of the primates, several of these groups are paraphyletic, or rather they do not include all the descendants of a common ancestor.

In contrast with Clark&#x27;s methodology, modern classifications typically identify (or name) only those groupings that are monophyletic; that is, such a named group includes &quot;all&quot; the descendants of the group&#x27;s common ancestor.

All groups with scientific names are clades, or monophyletic groups, and the sequence of scientific classification reflects the evolutionary history of the related lineages. Groups that are traditionally named are shown on the right; they form an &quot;ascending series&quot; (per Clark, see above), and several groups are paraphyletic:

* Prosimians contain two monophyletic groups (the suborder Strepsirrhini, or lemurs, lorises and allies, as well as the tarsiers of the suborder Haplorhini); it is a paraphyletic grouping because it excludes the Simiiformes, which also are descendants of the common ancestor Primates.
* Monkeys comprise two monophyletic groups, New World monkeys and Old World monkeys, but is paraphyletic because it excludes hominoids, superfamily Hominoidea, also descendants of the common ancestor Simiiformes.
* Apes as a whole, and the great apes, are paraphyletic if the terms are used such that they exclude humans.

Thus, the members of the two sets of groups, and hence names, do not match, which causes problems in relating scientific names to common (usually traditional) names. Consider the superfamily Hominoidea: In terms of the common names on the right, this group consists of apes and humans and there is no single common name for all the members of the group. One remedy is to create a new common name, in this case &quot;hominoids&quot;. Another possibility is to expand the use of one of the traditional names. For example, in his 2005 book, the vertebrate palaeontologist Benton wrote, &quot;The apes, Hominoidea, today include the gibbons and orangutan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans&quot;; thereby Benton was using &quot;apes&quot; to mean hominoids. In that case, the group heretofore called &quot;apes&quot; must now be identified as the non-human apes.

, there is no consensus as to whether to accept traditional (that is, common), but paraphyletic, names or to use monophyletic names only; or to use &#x27;new&#x27; common names or adaptations of old ones. Both competing approaches can be found in biological sources, often in the same work, and sometimes by the same author. Thus, Benton defines &quot;apes&quot; to include humans, then he repeatedly uses &quot;ape-like&quot; to mean &#x27;like an ape rather than a human&#x27;; and when discussing the reaction of others to a new fossil he writes of &quot;claims that &quot;Orrorin&quot; ... was an ape rather than a human&quot;.

==Classification of living primates==
Order Primates was established by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, in the tenth edition of his book &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, for the genera &quot;Homo&quot; (humans), &quot;Simia&quot; (other apes and monkeys), &quot;Lemur&quot; (prosimians) and &quot;Vespertilio&quot; (bats). In the first edition of the same book (1735), he had used the name Anthropomorpha for &quot;Homo&quot;, &quot;Simia&quot; and &quot;Bradypus&quot; (sloths). In 1839, Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, following Linnaeus and aping his nomenclature, established the orders Secundates (including the suborders Chiroptera, Insectivora and Carnivora), Tertiates (or Glires) and Quaternates (including Gravigrada, Pachydermata and Ruminantia), but these new taxa were not accepted.

Before Anderson and Jones introduced the classification of Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini in 1984, (followed by McKenna and Bell&#x27;s 1997 work &quot;Classification of Mammals: Above the species level&quot;), Primates was divided into two superfamilies: Prosimii and Anthropoidea. Prosimii included all of the prosimians: Strepsirrhini plus the tarsiers. Anthropoidea contained all of the simians.

The cladogram below shows one possible classification sequence of the living primates: groups that use common (traditional) names are shown on the right.
==Phylogeny and genetics==

Order Primates is part of the clade Euarchontoglires, which is nested within the clade Eutheria of Class Mammalia. Recent molecular genetic research on primates, colugos, and treeshrews has shown that the two species of colugos are more closely related to primates than to treeshrews, even though treeshrews were at one time considered primates. These three orders make up the clade Euarchonta. The combination of this clade with the clade Glires (composed of Rodentia and Lagomorpha) forms the clade Euarchontoglires. Variously, both Euarchonta and Euarchontoglires are ranked as superorders. Some scientists consider Dermoptera to be a suborder of Primates and use the suborder Euprimates for the &quot;true&quot; primates.

===Evolutionary history===

The primate lineage is thought to go back at least near the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary or around 74–63 (mya). The earliest possible primate/proto-primate may be &quot;Purgatorius&quot;, which dates back to Early Paleocene of North America ~66mya. The oldest known primates from the fossil record date to the Late Paleocene of Africa, c.57 mya (&quot;Altiatlasius&quot;) or the Paleocene-Eocene transition in the northern continents, c. 55 mya (&quot;Cantius&quot;, &quot;Donrussellia&quot;, &quot;Altanius&quot;, &quot;Plesiadapis&quot; and &quot;Teilhardina&quot;). Other studies, including molecular clock studies, have estimated the origin of the primate branch to have been in the mid-Cretaceous period, around 85 mya.

By modern cladistic reckoning, the order Primates is monophyletic. The suborder Strepsirrhini, the &quot;wet-nosed&quot; primates, is generally thought to have split off from the primitive primate line about 63 mya, although earlier dates are also supported. The seven strepsirrhine families are the five related lemur families and the two remaining families that include the lorisids and the galagos. Older classification schemes wrap Lepilemuridae into Lemuridae and Galagidae into Lorisidae, yielding a four-one family distribution instead of five-two as presented here. During the Eocene, most of the northern continents were dominated by two groups, the adapiforms and the omomyids. The former are considered members of Strepsirrhini, but did not have a toothcomb like modern lemurs; recent analysis has demonstrated that &quot;Darwinius masillae&quot; fits into this grouping. The latter was closely related to tarsiers, monkeys, and apes. How these two groups relate to extant primates is unclear. Omomyids perished about 30 mya, while adapiforms survived until about 10 mya.

According to genetic studies, the lemurs of Madagascar diverged from the lorisoids approximately 75 mya. These studies, as well as chromosomal and molecular evidence, also show that lemurs are more closely related to each other than to other strepsirrhine primates. However, Madagascar split from Africa 160 mya and from India 90 mya. To account for these facts, a founding lemur population of a few individuals is thought to have reached Madagascar from Africa via a single rafting event between 50 and 80 mya. Other colonization options have been suggested, such as multiple colonizations from Africa and India, but none are supported by the genetic and molecular evidence.

Until recently, the aye-aye has been difficult to place within Strepsirrhini. Theories had been proposed that its family, Daubentoniidae, was either a lemuriform primate (meaning its ancestors split from the lemur line more recently than lemurs and lorises split) or a sister group to all the other strepsirrhines. In 2008, the aye-aye family was confirmed to be most closely related to the other Malagasy lemurs, likely having descended from the same ancestral population that colonized the island.

Suborder Haplorhini, the simple-nosed or &quot;dry-nosed&quot; primates, is composed of two sister clades. Prosimian tarsiers in the family Tarsiidae (monotypic in its own infraorder Tarsiiformes), represent the most basal division, originating about 58 mya. The earliest known haplorhine skeleton, that of 55 MA old tarsier-like &quot;Archicebus&quot;, was found in central China, supporting an already suspected Asian origin for the group. The infraorder Simiiformes (simian primates, consisting of monkeys and apes) emerged about 40 mya, possibly also in Asia; if so, they dispersed across the Tethys Sea from Asia to Africa soon afterwards. There are two simian clades, both s: Catarrhini, which developed in Africa, consisting of Old World monkeys, humans and the other apes, and Platyrrhini, which developed in South America, consisting of New World monkeys. A third clade, which included the eosimiids, developed in Asia, but became extinct millions of years ago.

As in the case of lemurs, the origin of New World monkeys is unclear. Molecular studies of concatenated nuclear sequences have yielded a widely varying estimated date of divergence between platyrrhines and catarrhines, ranging from 33 to 70 mya, while studies based on mitochondrial sequences produce a narrower range of 35 to 43 mya. The anthropoid primates possibly traversed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to South America during the Eocene by island hopping, facilitated by Atlantic Ocean ridges and a lowered sea level. Alternatively, a single rafting event may explain this transoceanic colonization. Due to continental drift, the Atlantic Ocean was not nearly as wide at the time as it is today. Research suggests that a small primate could have survived 13 days on a raft of vegetation. Given estimated current and wind speeds, this would have provided enough time to make the voyage between the continents.

Apes and monkeys spread from Africa into Europe and Asia starting in the Miocene. Soon after, the lorises and tarsiers made the same journey. The first hominin fossils were discovered in northern Africa and date back 5–8 mya. Old World monkeys disappeared from Europe about 1.8 mya. Molecular and fossil studies generally show that modern humans originated in Africa 100,000–200,000 years ago.

Although primates are well studied in comparison to other animal groups, several new species have been discovered recently, and genetic tests have revealed previously unrecognised species in known populations. &quot;Primate Taxonomy&quot; listed about 350 species of primates in 2001; the author, Colin Groves, increased that number to 376 for his contribution to the third edition of &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (MSW3). However, publications since the taxonomy in MSW3 was compiled in 2003 have pushed the number to 522 species, or 708 including subspecies.

===Hybrids===
Primate hybrids usually arise in captivity, but there have also been examples in the wild. Hybridization occurs where two species&#x27; range overlap to form hybrid zones; hybrids may be created by humans when animals are placed in zoos or due to environmental pressures such as predation. Intergeneric hybridizations, hybrids of different genera, have also been found in the wild. Although they belong to genera that have been distinct for several million years, interbreeding still occurs between the gelada and the hamadryas baboon.

===Clones===
On 24 January 2018, scientists in China reported in the journal &quot;Cell&quot; the creation of two crab-eating macaque clones, named &quot;Zhong Zhong&quot; and &quot;Hua Hua&quot;, using the complex DNA transfer method that produced &quot;Dolly&quot; the sheep, for the first time.

==Anatomy and physiology==

===Head===

The primate skull has a large, domed cranium, which is particularly prominent in anthropoids. The cranium protects the large brain, a distinguishing characteristic of this group. The endocranial volume (the volume within the skull) is three times greater in humans than in the greatest nonhuman primate, reflecting a larger brain size. The mean endocranial volume is 1,201 cubic centimeters in humans, 469 cm3 in gorillas, 400 cm3 in chimpanzees and 397 cm3 in orangutans. The primary evolutionary trend of primates has been the elaboration of the brain, in particular the neocortex (a part of the cerebral cortex), which is involved with sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, conscious thought and, in humans, language. While other mammals rely heavily on their sense of smell, the arboreal life of primates has led to a tactile, visually dominant sensory system, a reduction in the olfactory region of the brain and increasingly complex social behavior. The visual acuity of humans and other hominids is exceptional; they have the most acute vision known among all vertebrates, with the exception of certain species of predatory birds.

Primates have forward-facing eyes on the front of the skull; binocular vision allows accurate distance perception, useful for the brachiating ancestors of all great apes. A bony ridge above the eye sockets reinforces weaker bones in the face, which are put under strain during chewing. Strepsirrhines have a postorbital bar, a bone around the eye socket, to protect their eyes; in contrast, the higher primates, haplorhines, have evolved fully enclosed sockets.

Primates show an evolutionary trend towards a reduced snout. Technically, Old World monkeys are distinguished from New World monkeys by the structure of the nose, and from apes by the arrangement of their teeth. In New World monkeys, the nostrils face sideways; in Old World monkeys, they face downwards. Dental pattern in primates vary considerably; although some have lost most of their incisors, all retain at least one lower incisor. In most strepsirrhines, the lower incisors form a toothcomb, which is used in grooming and sometimes foraging. Old World monkeys have eight premolars, compared with 12 in New World monkeys. The Old World species are divided into apes and monkeys depending on the number of cusps on their molars: monkeys have four, apes have five - although humans may have four or five. The main hominid molar cusp (hypocone) evolved in early primate history, while the cusp of the corresponding primitive lower molar (paraconid) was lost. Prosimians are distinguished by their immobilized upper lips, the moist tip of their noses and forward-facing lower front teeth.

===Body===

Primates generally have five digits on each limb (pentadactyly), with a characteristic type of keratin fingernail on the end of each finger and toe. The bottom sides of the hands and feet have sensitive pads on the fingertips. Most have opposable thumbs, a characteristic primate feature most developed in humans, though not limited to this order (opossums and koalas, for example, also have them). Thumbs allow some species to use tools. In primates, the combination of opposing thumbs, short fingernails (rather than claws) and long, inward-closing fingers is a relict of the ancestral practice of gripping branches, and has, in part, allowed some species to develop brachiation (swinging by the arms from tree limb to tree limb) as a significant means of locomotion. Prosimians have clawlike nails on the second toe of each foot, called toilet-claws, which they use for grooming.

The primate collar bone is a prominent element of the pectoral girdle; this allows the shoulder joint broad mobility. Compared to Old World monkeys, apes have more mobile shoulder joints and arms due to the dorsal position of the scapula, broad ribcages that are flatter front-to-back, a shorter, less mobile spine, and with lower vertebrae greatly reduced - resulting in tail loss in some species. Prehensile tails are found in the New World atelids, including the howler, spider, woolly spider, woolly monkeys; and in capuchins. Male primates have a low-hanging penis and testes descended into a scrotum.

===Sexual dimorphism===
Sexual dimorphism is often exhibited in simians, though to a greater degree in Old World species (apes and some monkeys) than New World species. Recent studies involve comparing DNA to examine both the variation in the expression of the dimorphism among primates and the fundamental causes of sexual dimorphism. Primates usually have dimorphism in body mass and canine tooth size along with pelage and skin color. The dimorphism can be attributed to and affected by different factors, including mating system, size, habitat and diet.

Comparative analyses have generated a more complete understanding of the relationship between sexual selection, natural selection, and mating systems in primates. Studies have shown that dimorphism is the product of changes in both male and female traits. Ontogenetic scaling, where relative extension of a common growth trajectory occurs, may give some insight into the relationship between sexual dimorphism and growth patterns. Some evidence from the fossil record suggests that there was convergent evolution of dimorphism, and some extinct hominids probably had greater dimorphism than any living primate.

===Locomotion===

Primate species move by brachiation, bipedalism, leaping, arboreal and terrestrial quadrupedalism, climbing, knuckle-walking or by a combination of these methods. Several prosimians are primarily vertical clingers and leapers. These include many bushbabies, all indriids (i.e., sifakas, avahis and indris), sportive lemurs, and all tarsiers. Other prosimians are arboreal quadrupeds and climbers. Some are also terrestrial quadrupeds, while some are leapers. Most monkeys are both arboreal and terrestrial quadrupeds and climbers. Gibbons, muriquis and spider monkeys all brachiate extensively, with gibbons sometimes doing so in remarkably acrobatic fashion. Woolly monkeys also brachiate at times. Orangutans use a similar form of locomotion called quadramanous climbing, in which they use their arms and legs to carry their heavy bodies through the trees. Chimpanzees and gorillas knuckle walk, and can move bipedally for short distances. Although numerous species, such as australopithecines and early hominids, have exhibited fully bipedal locomotion, humans are the only extant species with this trait.

===Vision===

The evolution of color vision in primates is unique among most eutherian mammals. While the remote vertebrate ancestors of the primates possessed three color vision (trichromaticism), the nocturnal, warm-blooded, mammalian ancestors lost one of three cones in the retina during the Mesozoic era. Fish, reptiles and birds are therefore trichromatic or tetrachromatic, while all mammals, with the exception of some primates and marsupials, are dichromats or monochromats (totally color blind). Nocturnal primates, such as the night monkeys and bush babies, are often monochromatic. Catarrhines are routinely trichromatic due to a gene duplication of the red-green opsin gene at the base of their lineage, 30 to 40 million years ago. Platyrrhines, on the other hand, are trichromatic in a few cases only. Specifically, individual females must be heterozygous for two alleles of the opsin gene (red and green) located on the same locus of the X chromosome. Males, therefore, can only be dichromatic, while females can be either dichromatic or trichromatic. Color vision in strepsirrhines is not as well understood; however, research indicates a range of color vision similar to that found in platyrrhines.

Like catarrhines, howler monkeys (a family of platyrrhines) show routine trichromatism that has been traced to an evolutionarily recent gene duplication. Howler monkeys are one of the most specialized leaf-eaters of the New World monkeys; fruits are not a major part of their diets, and the type of leaves they prefer to consume (young, nutritive, and digestible) are detectable only by a red-green signal. Field work exploring the dietary preferences of howler monkeys suggests that routine trichromaticism was selected by environment.

==Behavior==

===Social systems===
Richard Wrangham stated that social systems of primates are best classified by the amount of movement by females occurring between groups. He proposed four categories:

* Female transfer systems – females move away from the group in which they were born. Females of a group will not be closely related whereas males will have remained with their natal groups, and this close association may be influential in social behavior. The groups formed are generally quite small. This organization can be seen in chimpanzees, where the males, who are typically related, will cooperate in defense of the group&#x27;s territory. Evidence of this social system has also been found among Neanderthal remains in Spain and in remains of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot; groups in southern Africa. Among New World Monkeys, spider monkeys and muriquis use this system.

* Male transfer systems – while the females remain in their natal groups, the males will emigrate as adolescents. Group sizes are usually larger. This system is common among the ring-tailed lemur, capuchin monkeys and cercopithecine monkeys.
* Monogamous species – a male–female bond, sometimes accompanied by a juvenile offspring. There is shared responsibility of parental care and territorial defense. The offspring leaves the parents&#x27; territory during adolescence. Indri, lariang tarsiers, Callitrichidae monkeys and gibbons use this system, although &quot;monogamy&quot; in this context does not necessarily mean absolute sexual fidelity. These species do not live in larger groups.
* Solitary species – males and females live in overlapping home ranges. This type of organization is found in lorises, galagos, mouse lemurs, aye-ayes and orangutans.

Other systems are known to occur as well. For example, with howler monkeys and gorillas both the males and females typically transfer from their natal group on reaching sexual maturity, resulting in groups in which neither the males nor females are typically related. Some prosimians, colobine monkeys and callitrichid monkeys also use this system.

The transfer of females or males from their native group is likely an adaptation for avoiding inbreeding. An analysis of breeding records of captive primate colonies representing numerous different species indicates that the infant mortality of inbred young is generally higher than that of non-inbred young. This effect of inbreeding on infant mortality is probably largely a result of increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles (see Inbreeding depression).

Primatologist Jane Goodall, who studied in the Gombe Stream National Park, noted fission-fusion societies in chimpanzees. There is &quot;fission&quot; when the main group splits up to forage during the day, then &quot;fusion&quot; when the group returns at night to sleep as a group. This social structure can also be observed in the hamadryas baboon, spider monkeys and the bonobo. The gelada has a similar social structure in which many smaller groups come together to form temporary herds of up to 600 monkeys. Humans also form fission-fusion societies. In hunter-gatherer societies, humans form groups which are made up of several individuals that may split up to obtain different resources.

These social systems are affected by three main ecological factors: distribution of resources, group size, and predation. Within a social group there is a balance between cooperation and competition. Cooperative behaviors in many primates species include social grooming (removing skin parasites and cleaning wounds), food sharing, and collective defense against predators or of a territory. Aggressive behaviors often signal competition for food, sleeping sites or mates. Aggression is also used in establishing dominance hierarchies.

In November 2023, scientists reported, for the first time, evidence that groups of primates, particularly bonobos, are capable of cooperating with each other.

===Interspecific associations===
Several species of primates are known to associate in the wild. Some of these associations have been extensively studied. In the Tai Forest of Africa, several species coordinate anti-predator behavior. These include the Diana monkey, Campbell&#x27;s mona monkey, lesser spot-nosed monkey, western red colobus, king colobus (western black and white colobus), and sooty mangabey, which coordinate anti-predator alarm calls. Among the predators of these monkeys is the common chimpanzee.

The red-tailed monkey associates with several species, including the western red colobus, blue monkey, Wolf&#x27;s mona monkey, mantled guereza, black crested mangabey and Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey. Several of these species are preyed upon by the common chimpanzee.

In South America, squirrel monkeys associate with capuchin monkeys. This may have more to do with foraging benefits to the squirrel monkeys than anti-predation benefits.

===Mating systems===

The mating systems of primates vary between monogamy, polyandry, polygyny and polygynandry. In monogamous species, adult males and females form long-lasting pair bonds. Compared to other systems, there is little competition for mating rights and males and females tend to be similar in size. Polyandry, which involves groups consisting of single females mating with multiple males, may arise as a secondary mating system in monogamous species. In the brown-mantled tamarin, a female may breeding with one or two males. Polyandry may have developed due to the high frequency of twin births, which require more help in raising. 

Polygynous species include gorillas, Hanuman langurs, geladas, hamadryas baboons, proboscis monkeys, and golden snub-nosed monkeys, and consists of one male mating with multiple females within a harem or one-male unit. Sexual dimorphism tends to be higher in these species and males may also develop prominent secondary sex characteristics. In the patriarchal hamadryas baboon, the males aggressively herd females into their groups and violently discipline those that wander. By contrast, in gelada society, which is based on female kinship, a male is dependent on the support of the females in his unit and cannot impose on them. Polygynous males must defend their harems from rivals, who may try to take over.

In some species, such as ring-tailed lemurs, sifakas, macaques, most baboons, mangabeys, squirrel monkeys, woolly monkeys, spider monkeys, woolly spider monkeys, chimpanzees and bonobos, both males and females mate with multiple partners. Polygynandry occurs in multimale-multifemale groups, and since females mate many times before conception, males have large testicles for sperm competition. Males may exist in a dominance hierarchy and those at the top will try to monopolize access to the females. Consortships may occur in some species but these are short-term. In solitary-living species, males and females mate with partners whose home ranges they overlap with. This is known as a &#x27;dispersed&#x27; mating system.

Genetic evidence indicates that humans were predominantly polygynous for most of their existence as a species, but that this began to shift during the Neolithic, when monogamy started becoming widespread concomitantly with the transition from nomadic to sedentary societies. Most modern human societies consist of monogamous marriages, but allow for polygyny, particularly for those of a high status.

===Sexual behavior=== 

Female primates may signal to the male their receptiveness though various displays including eye-contact, tongue-clicking and presenting of the rump. Female lemurs, lorises and galagos will position themselves in the lordosis pose while female chimpanzees, bonobos and some Old World monkeys develop sexual swellings on the rump. Copulation in primates typically involves the males mounting the females from behind, as with most mammals. Belly-to-belly copulation has been recorded in apes, both gibbons and the great apes. Human sex positions are modifications of these two positions. 

Primates may egage in sexual activity as part of social bonding; including homosexual behaviour. Such behavior play an important role in bonobo society in particular. female bonobos engage in mutual genital-rubbing behavior, possibly to bond socially with each other, thus forming a female nucleus of bonobo society. The bonding among females enables them to dominate most of the males.

===Life history===

Primates have slower rates of development than other mammals. All primate infants are breastfed by their mothers (with the exception of some human cultures and various zoo raised primates which are fed formula) and rely on them for grooming and transportation. In some species, infants are protected and transported by males in the group, particularly males who may be their fathers. Other relatives of the infant, such as siblings and aunts, may participate in its care as well. Most primate mothers cease ovulation while breastfeeding an infant; once the infant is weaned the mother can reproduce again. This often leads to weaning conflict with infants who attempt to continue breastfeeding.

Infanticide is common in polygynous species such as gray langurs and gorillas. Adult males may kill dependent offspring that are not theirs so the female will return to estrus and thus they can sire offspring of their own. Social monogamy in some species may have evolved to combat this behavior. Polygynandry may also lessen the risk of infanticide since paternity becomes uncertain.

Primates have a longer juvenile period between weaning and sexual maturity than other mammals of similar size. Some primates such as galagos and New World monkeys use tree-holes for nesting, and park juveniles in leafy patches while foraging. Other primates follow a strategy of &quot;riding&quot;, i.e. carrying individuals on the body while feeding. Adults may construct or use nesting sites, sometimes accompanied by juveniles, for the purpose of resting, a behavior which has developed secondarily in the great apes. During the juvenile period, primates are more susceptible than adults to predation and starvation; they gain experience in feeding and avoiding predators during this time. They learn social and fighting skills, often through playing. Primates, especially females, have longer lifespans than other similarly sized mammals, this may be partially due to their slower metabolisms. Late in life, female catarrhine primates appear to undergo a cessation of reproductive function known as menopause; other groups are less studied.

===Diet and feeding===

Primates exploit a variety of food sources. It has been said that many characteristics of modern primates, including humans, derive from an early ancestor&#x27;s practice of taking most of its food from the tropical canopy. Most primates include fruit in their diets to obtain easily digested nutrients including carbohydrates and lipids for energy. Primates in the suborder Strepsirrhini (non-tarsier prosimians) are able to synthesize vitamin C, like most other mammals, while primates of the suborder Haplorhini (tarsiers, monkeys and apes) have lost this ability, and require the vitamin in their diet.

Many primates have anatomical specializations that enable them to exploit particular foods, such as fruit, leaves, gum or insects. For example, leaf eaters such as howler monkeys, black-and-white colobuses and sportive lemurs have extended digestive tracts which enable them to absorb nutrients from leaves that can be difficult to digest. Marmosets, which are gum eaters, have strong incisor teeth, enabling them to open tree bark to get to the gum, and claws rather than nails, enabling them to cling to trees while feeding. The aye-aye combines rodent-like teeth with a long, thin middle finger to fill the same ecological niche as a woodpecker. It taps on trees to find insect larvae, then gnaws holes in the wood and inserts its elongated middle finger to pull the larvae out. Some species have additional specializations. For example, the grey-cheeked mangabey has thick enamel on its teeth, enabling it to open hard fruits and seeds that other monkeys cannot. The gelada is the only primate species that feeds primarily on grass.

====Hunting====

Tarsiers are the only extant obligate carnivorous primates, exclusively eating insects, crustaceans, small vertebrates and snakes (including venomous species). Capuchin monkeys can exploit many different types of plant matter, including fruit, leaves, flowers, buds, nectar and seeds, but also eat insects and other invertebrates, bird eggs, and small vertebrates such as birds, lizards, squirrels and bats.

The common chimpanzee eats an omnivorous frugivorous diet. It prefers fruit above all other food items and even seeks out and eats them when they are not abundant. It also eats leaves and leaf buds, seeds, blossoms, stems, pith, bark and resin. Insects and meat make up a small proportion of their diet, estimated as 2%. The meat consumption includes predation on other primate species, such as the western red colobus monkey. The bonobo is an omnivorous frugivore – the majority of its diet is fruit, but it supplements this with leaves, meat from small vertebrates, such as anomalures, flying squirrels and duikers, and invertebrates. In some instances, bonobos have been shown to consume lower-order primates.

Until the development of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; employed a hunter-gatherer method as their sole means of food collection. This involved combining stationary food sources (such as fruits, grains, tubers, and mushrooms, insect larvae and aquatic mollusks) with wild game, which must be hunted and killed in order to be consumed. It has been proposed that humans have used fire to prepare and cook food since the time of &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. Around ten thousand years ago, humans developed agriculture, which substantially altered their diet. This change in diet may also have altered human biology; with the spread of dairy farming providing a new and rich source of food, leading to the evolution of the ability to digest lactose in some adults.

===As prey===
Predators of primates include various species of carnivorans, birds of prey, reptiles, and other primates. Even gorillas have been recorded as prey. Predators of primates have diverse hunting strategies and as such, primates have evolved several different antipredator adaptations including crypsis, alarm calls and mobbing. Several species have separate alarm calls for different predators such as air-borne or ground-dwelling predators. Predation may have shaped group size in primates as species exposed to higher predation pressures appear to live in larger groups.

===Communication===

Lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, and New World monkeys rely on olfactory signals for many aspects of social and reproductive behavior. Specialized glands are used to mark territories with pheromones, which are detected by the vomeronasal organ; this process forms a large part of the communication behavior of these primates. In Old World monkeys and apes this ability is mostly vestigial, having regressed as trichromatic eyes evolved to become the main sensory organ. Primates also use vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions to convey psychological state. Facial musculature is very developed in primates, particularly in monkeys and apes, allowing for complex facial communication. Like humans, chimpanzees can distinguish the faces of familiar and unfamiliar individuals. Hand and arm gestures are also important forms of communication for great apes and a single gesture can have multiple functions. Chest-beating in male gorillas is a form of visual and non-vocal sound communication that serves to show fitness to both rivals and females.

Primates are a particularly vocal group of mammals. Indris and black-and-white ruffed lemurs make distinctive, loud songs and choruses which maintain territories and act as alarm calls. The Philippine tarsier, has a high-frequency limit of auditory sensitivity of approximately 91 kHz with a dominant frequency of 70 kHz, among the highest recorded for any terrestrial mammal. For Philippine tarsiers, these ultrasonic vocalizations might represent a private channel of communication that subverts detection by predators, prey and competitors, enhances energetic efficiency, or improves detection against low-frequency background noise. Male howler monkeys are among the loudest land mammals as their roars can be heard up to , and relate to intergroup spacing, territorial protection and possibly mate-guarding. Male and female siamangs both possess inflatable pouches in the throat with which pair -bonds use to sing &quot;duets&quot; to each other. The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary according to the call. Furthermore, many primate species including chimpanzees, Campbell&#x27;s mona monkeys or Diana monkeys have been shown to combine vocalizations in sequences, suggesting syntax may not be uniquely humans as previously thought but rather evolutionary ancient, and its origins may be deeply rooted in the primate lineage. 

Consonant- and vowel-like sounds exist in some orangutan calls and they maintain their meaning over great distances. The time range for the evolution of human language and/or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of &quot;Homo&quot; (2.3 to 2.4 million years ago) from &quot;Pan&quot; (5 to 6 million years ago) to the emergence of full behavioral modernity some 50,000–150,000 years ago. Few dispute that &quot;Australopithecus&quot; probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of great apes in general.

===Intelligence and cognition===

Primates have advanced cognitive abilities: some make tools and use them to acquire food and for social displays; some can perform tasks requiring cooperation, influence and rank; they are status conscious, manipulative and capable of deception; they can recognise kin and conspecifics; and they can learn to use symbols and understand aspects of human language including some relational syntax and concepts of number and numerical sequence. Research in primate cognition explores problem solving, memory, social interaction, a theory of mind, and numerical, spatial, and abstract concepts. Comparative studies show a trend towards higher intelligence going from prosimians to New World monkeys to Old World monkeys, and significantly higher average cognitive abilities in the great apes. However, there is a great deal of variation in each group (e.g., among New World monkeys, both spider and capuchin monkeys have scored highly by some measures), as well as in the results of different studies.

====Tool use and manufacture====

In 1960, Jane Goodall observed a chimpanzee poking pieces of grass into a termite mound and then raising the grass to his mouth. After he left, Goodall approached the mound and repeated the behaviour because she was unsure what the chimpanzee was doing. She found that the termites bit onto the grass with their jaws. The chimpanzee had been using the grass as a tool to &quot;fish&quot; or &quot;dip&quot; for termites. There are more limited reports of the closely related bonobo using tools in the wild; it has been claimed they rarely use tools in the wild although they use tools as readily as chimpanzees when in captivity. It has been reported that females, both chimpanzee and bonobo, use tools more avidly than males. Orangutans in Borneo scoop catfish out of small ponds. Over two years, anthropologist Anne Russon observed orangutans learning to jab sticks at catfish to scare them out of the ponds and in to their waiting hands. There are few reports of gorillas using tools in the wild. An adult female western lowland gorilla used a branch as a walking stick apparently to test water depth and to aid her in crossing a pool of water. Another adult female used a detached trunk from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food gathering, and another used a log as a bridge.

The first direct observation of a non-ape primate using a tool in a wild environment occurred in 1988. Primatologist Sue Boinski watched an adult male white-faced capuchin beat a fer-de-lance snake to death with a dead branch. The black-striped capuchin was the first non-ape primate for which routine tool use was documented in the wild; individuals were observed cracking nuts by placing them on a stone anvil and hitting them with another large stone. In Thailand and Myanmar, crab-eating macaques use stone tools to open nuts, oysters and other bivalves, and various types of sea snails. Chacma baboons use stones as weapons; stoning by these baboons is done from the rocky walls of the canyon where they sleep and retreat to when they are threatened. Stones are lifted with one hand and dropped over the side whereupon they tumble down the side of the cliff or fall directly to the canyon floor.

Although they have not been observed to use tools in the wild, lemurs in controlled settings have been shown to be capable of understanding the functional properties of the objects they had been trained to use as tools, performing as well as tool-using haplorhines.

Soon after her initial discovery of tool use, Goodall observed other chimpanzees picking up leafy twigs, stripping off the leaves and using the stems to fish for insects. This change of a leafy twig into a tool was a major discovery. Prior to this, scientists thought that only humans manufactured and used tools, and that this ability was what separated humans from other animals. Chimpanzees have also been observed making &quot;sponges&quot; out of leaves and moss that suck up water. Sumatran orangutans have been observed making and using tools. They will break off a tree branch that is about 30 cm long, snap off the twigs, fray one end and then use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites. In the wild, mandrills have been observed to clean their ears with modified tools. Scientists filmed a large male mandrill at Chester Zoo (UK) stripping down a twig, apparently to make it narrower, and then using the modified stick to scrape dirt from underneath its toenails. Captive gorillas have made a variety of tools.

==Ecology==
Non-human primates primarily live in the tropical latitudes of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Species that live outside of the tropics include the Japanese macaque which lives in the Japanese islands of Honshū and Hokkaido; the Barbary macaque which lives in North Africa and several species of langur which live in China. Primates tend to live in tropical rainforests but are also found in temperate forests, savannas, deserts, mountains and coastal areas. The number of primate species within tropical areas has been shown to be positively correlated to the amount of rainfall and the amount of rain forest area. Accounting for 25% to 40% of the fruit-eating animals (by weight) within tropical rainforests, primates play an important ecological role by dispersing seeds of many tree species.

Primate habitats span a range of altitudes: the black snub-nosed monkey has been found living in the Hengduan Mountains at altitudes of 4,700 meters (15,400 ft), the mountain gorilla can be found at 4,200 meters (13,200 ft) crossing the Virunga Mountains, and the gelada has been found at elevations of up to in the Ethiopian Highlands. Some species interact with aquatic environments and may swim or even dive, including the proboscis monkey, De Brazza&#x27;s monkey and Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey. Some primates, such as the rhesus macaque and gray langurs, can exploit human-modified environments and even live in cities.

==Interactions between humans and other primates==

===Disease transmission===
Close interactions between humans and non-human primates (NHPs) can create pathways for the transmission of zoonotic diseases. Viruses such as &quot;Herpesviridae&quot; (most notably Herpes B Virus), &quot;Poxviridae&quot;, measles, ebola, rabies, the Marburg virus and viral hepatitis can be transmitted to humans; in some cases the viruses produce potentially fatal diseases in both humans and non-human primates.

===Legal and social status===
Only humans are recognized as persons and protected in law by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The legal status of NHPs, on the other hand, is the subject of much debate, with organizations such as the Great Ape Project (GAP) campaigning to award at least some of them legal rights. In June 2008, Spain became the first country in the world to recognize the rights of some NHPs, when its parliament&#x27;s cross-party environmental committee urged the country to comply with GAP&#x27;s recommendations, which are that chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas are not to be used for animal experiments.

Many species of NHP are kept as pets by humans. The Allied Effort to Save Other Primates (AESOP) estimates that around 15,000 NHPs live as exotic pets in the United States. The expanding Chinese middle class has increased demand for NHPs as exotic pets in recent years. Although NHP import for the pet trade was banned in the U.S. in 1975, smuggling still occurs along the United States – Mexico border, with prices ranging from US$3000 for monkeys to $30,000 for apes.

Primates are used as model organisms in laboratories and have been used in space missions. They serve as service animals for disabled humans. Capuchin monkeys can be trained to assist quadriplegic humans; their intelligence, memory, and manual dexterity make them ideal helpers.

NHPs are kept in zoos around the globe. Historically, zoos were primarily a form of entertainment, but more recently have shifted their focus towards conservation, education and research. GAP does not insist that all NHPs should be released from zoos, primarily because captive-born primates lack the knowledge and experience to survive in the wild if released.

===Role in scientific research===
Thousands of non-human primates are used around the world in research because of their psychological and physiological similarity to humans. In particular, the brains and eyes of NHPs more closely parallel human anatomy than those of any other animals. NHPs are commonly used in preclinical trials, neuroscience, ophthalmology studies, and toxicity studies. Rhesus macaques are often used, as are other macaques, African green monkeys, chimpanzees, baboons, squirrel monkeys, and marmosets, both wild-caught and purpose-bred.

In 2005, GAP reported that 1,280 of the 3,100 NHPs living in captivity in the United States were used for experiments. In 2004, the European Union used around 10,000 NHPs in such experiments; in 2005 in Great Britain, 4,652 experiments were conducted on 3,115 NHPs. Governments of many nations have strict care requirements of NHPs kept in captivity. In the US, federal guidelines extensively regulate aspects of NHP housing, feeding, enrichment, and breeding. European groups such as the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments are seeking a ban on all NHP use in experiments as part of the European Union&#x27;s review of animal testing legislation.

===Extinction threats===

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists more than a third of primates as critically endangered or vulnerable. About 60% of primate species are threatened with extinction, including: 87% of species in Madagascar, 73% in Asia, 37% in Africa, and 36% in South and Central America. Additionally, 75% of primate species have decreasing populations. Trade is regulated, as all species are listed by CITES in Appendix II, except 50 species and subspecies listed in Appendix I, which gain full protection from trade.

Common threats to primate species include deforestation, forest fragmentation, monkey drives (resulting from primate crop raiding), and primate hunting for use in medicines, as pets, and for food. Large-scale tropical forest clearing is widely regarded as the process that most threatens primates. More than 90% of primate species occur in tropical forests. The main cause of forest loss is clearing for agriculture, although commercial logging, subsistence harvesting of timber, mining, and dam construction also contribute to tropical forest destruction. In Indonesia large areas of lowland forest have been cleared to increase palm oil production, and one analysis of satellite imagery concluded that during 1998 and 1999 there was a loss of 1,000 Sumatran orangutans per year in the Leuser Ecosystem alone.

Primates with a large body size (over 5 kg) are at increased extinction risk due to their greater profitability to poachers compared to smaller primates. They reach sexual maturity later and have a longer period between births. Populations therefore recover more slowly after being depleted by poaching or the pet trade. Data for some African cities show that half of all protein consumed in urban areas comes from the bushmeat trade. Endangered primates such as guenons and the drill are hunted at levels that far exceed sustainable levels. This is due to their large body size, ease of transport and profitability per animal. As farming encroaches on forest habitats, primates feed on the crops, causing the farmers large economic losses. Primate crop raiding gives locals a negative impression of primates, hindering conservation efforts.

Madagascar, home to five endemic primate families, has experienced the greatest extinction of the recent past; since human settlement 1,500 years ago, at least eight classes and fifteen of the larger species have become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction. Among the primates wiped out were &quot;Archaeoindris&quot; (a lemur larger than a silverback gorilla) and the families Palaeopropithecidae and Archaeolemuridae.

In Asia, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam prohibit eating primate meat; however, primates are still hunted for food. Some smaller traditional religions allow the consumption of primate meat. The pet trade and traditional medicine also increase demand for illegal hunting. The rhesus macaque, a model organism, was protected after excessive trapping threatened its numbers in the 1960s; the program was so effective that they are now viewed as a pest throughout their range.

In Central and South America, forest fragmentation and hunting are the two main problems for primates. Large tracts of forest are now rare in Central America. This increases the amount of forest vulnerable to edge effects such as farmland encroachment, lower levels of humidity and a change in plant life. Movement restriction results in a greater amount of inbreeding, which can cause deleterious effects leading to a population bottleneck, whereby a significant percentage of the population is lost.

There are 21 critically endangered primates, seven of which have remained on the IUCN&#x27;s &quot;The World&#x27;s 25 Most Endangered Primates&quot; list since the year 2000: the silky sifaka, Delacour&#x27;s langur, the white-headed langur, the gray-shanked douc, the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey, the Cross River gorilla and the Sumatran orangutan. Miss Waldron&#x27;s red colobus was recently declared extinct when no trace of the subspecies could be found from 1993 to 1999. A few hunters have found and killed individuals since then, but the subspecies&#x27; prospects remain bleak.

<text>Politics () is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations among individuals, such as the distribution of status or resources.
The branch of social science that studies politics and government is referred to as political science.

Politics may be used positively in the context of a &quot;political solution&quot; which is compromising and non-violent, or descriptively as &quot;the art or science of government&quot;, but the word often also carries a negative connotation. The concept has been defined in various ways, and different approaches have fundamentally differing views on whether it should be used extensively or in a limited way, empirically or normatively, and on whether conflict or co-operation is more essential to it.

A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one&#x27;s own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising internal and external force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.

In modern nation states, people often form political parties to represent their ideas. Members of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders. An election is usually a competition between different parties.

A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a society. The history of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot;, Confucius&#x27;s political manuscripts and Chanakya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;politics&quot; has its roots in the name of Aristotle&#x27;s classic work, &quot;Politiká&quot;, which introduced the Ancient Greek term ()&quot;.&quot; In the mid-15th century, Aristotle&#x27;s composition was rendered in Early Modern English as , which became &quot;Politics&quot; in Modern English.

The singular &quot;politic&quot; first attested in English in 1430, coming from Middle French —itself taking from , a Latinization of the Greek () from () and ().

=== Definitions ===
* Harold Lasswell: &quot;who gets what, when, how&quot;
* David Easton: &quot;the authoritative allocation of values for a society&quot;
* Vladimir Lenin: &quot;the most concentrated expression of economics&quot;
* Otto von Bismarck: &quot;the capacity of always choosing at each instant, in constantly changing situations, the least harmful, the most useful&quot;
* Bernard Crick: &quot;a distinctive form of rule whereby people act together through institutionalized procedures to resolve differences&quot;
* Adrian Leftwich: &quot;comprises all the activities of co-operation, negotiation and conflict within and between societies&quot;

== Approaches ==
There are several ways in which approaching politics has been conceptualized.

=== Extensive and limited ===
Adrian Leftwich has differentiated views of politics based on how extensive or limited their perception of what accounts as &#x27;political&#x27; is. The extensive view sees politics as present across the sphere of human social relations, while the limited view restricts it to certain contexts. For example, in a more restrictive way, politics may be viewed as primarily about governance, while a feminist perspective could argue that sites which have been viewed traditionally as non-political, should indeed be viewed as political as well. This latter position is encapsulated in the slogan &quot;the personal is political&quot;, which disputes the distinction between private and public issues. Politics may also be defined by the use of power, as has been argued by Robert A. Dahl.

=== Moralism and realism ===
Some perspectives on politics view it empirically as an exercise of power, while others see it as a social function with a normative basis. This distinction has been called the difference between political &quot;moralism&quot; and political &quot;realism&quot;&quot;.&quot; For moralists, politics is closely linked to ethics, and is at its extreme in utopian thinking. For example, according to Hannah Arendt, the view of Aristotle was that, &quot;to be political…meant that everything was decided through words and persuasion and not through violence&quot;; while according to Bernard Crick, &quot;politics is the way in which free societies are governed. Politics is politics, and other forms of rule are something else.&quot; In contrast, for realists, represented by those such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, and Harold Lasswell, politics is based on the use of power, irrespective of the ends being pursued.

=== Conflict and co-operation ===
Agonism argues that politics essentially comes down to conflict between conflicting interests. Political scientist Elmer Schattschneider argued that &quot;at the root of all politics is the universal language of conflict&quot;, while for Carl Schmitt the essence of politics is the distinction of &#x27;friend&#x27; from &#x27;foe&#x27;. This is in direct contrast to the more co-operative views of politics by Aristotle and Crick. However, a more mixed view between these extremes is provided by Irish political scientist Michael Laver, who noted that:Politics is about the characteristic blend of conflict and co-operation that can be found so often in human interactions. Pure conflict is war. Pure co-operation is true love. Politics is a mixture of both.

== History ==


The history of politics spans human history and is not limited to modern institutions of government.

=== Prehistoric ===
Frans de Waal argued that chimpanzees engage in politics through &quot;social manipulation to secure and maintain influential positions&quot;. Early human forms of social organization—bands and tribes—lacked centralized political structures. These are sometimes referred to as stateless societies.

=== Early states ===
In ancient history, civilizations did not have definite boundaries as states have today, and their borders could be more accurately described as frontiers. Early dynastic Sumer, and early dynastic Egypt were the first civilizations to define their borders. Moreover, up to the 12th century, many people lived in non-state societies. These range from relatively egalitarian bands and tribes to complex and highly stratified chiefdoms.

==== State formation ====
There are a number of different theories and hypotheses regarding early state formation that seek generalizations to explain why the state developed in some places but not others. Other scholars believe that generalizations are unhelpful and that each case of early state formation should be treated on its own.

Voluntary theories contend that diverse groups of people came together to form states as a result of some shared rational interest. The theories largely focus on the development of agriculture, and the population and organizational pressure that followed and resulted in state formation. One of the most prominent theories of early and primary state formation is the &quot;hydraulic hypothesis&quot;, which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects.

Conflict theories of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as key to the formation of states. In contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over others. Some theories in turn argue that warfare was critical for state formation.

==== Ancient history ====
The first states of sorts were those of early dynastic Sumer and early dynastic Egypt, which arose from the Uruk period and Predynastic Egypt respectively around approximately 3000 BC. Early dynastic Egypt was based around the Nile River in the north-east of Africa, the kingdom&#x27;s boundaries being based around the Nile and stretching to areas where oases existed. Early dynastic Sumer was located in southern Mesopotamia, with its borders extending from the Persian Gulf to parts of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.

Egyptians, Romans, and the Greeks were the first people known to have explicitly formulated a political philosophy of the state, and to have rationally analyzed political institutions. Prior to this, states were described and justified in terms of religious myths.

Several important political innovations of classical antiquity came from the Greek city-states (&quot;polis&quot;) and the Roman Republic. The Greek city-states before the 4th century granted citizenship rights to their free population; in Athens these rights were combined with a directly democratic form of government that was to have a long afterlife in political thought and history.

=== Modern states ===

The Peace of Westphalia (1648) is considered by political scientists to be the beginning of the modern international system, in which external powers should avoid interfering in another country&#x27;s domestic affairs. The principle of non-interference in other countries&#x27; domestic affairs was laid out in the mid-18th century by Swiss jurist Emer de Vattel. States became the primary institutional agents in an interstate system of relations. The Peace of Westphalia is said to have ended attempts to impose supranational authority on European states. The &quot;Westphalian&quot; doctrine of states as independent agents was bolstered by the rise in 19th century thought of nationalism, under which legitimate states were assumed to correspond to &quot;nations&quot;—groups of people united by language and culture.

In Europe, during the 18th century, the classic non-national states were the multinational empires: the Austrian Empire, Kingdom of France, Kingdom of Hungary, the Russian Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire. Such empires also existed in Asia, Africa, and the Americas; in the Muslim world, immediately after the death of Muhammad in 632, Caliphates were established, which developed into multi-ethnic transnational empires. The multinational empire was an absolute monarchy ruled by a king, emperor or sultan. The population belonged to many ethnic groups, and they spoke many languages. The empire was dominated by one ethnic group, and their language was usually the language of public administration. The ruling dynasty was usually, but not always, from that group. Some of the smaller European states were not so ethnically diverse, but were also dynastic states, ruled by a royal house. A few of the smaller states survived, such as the independent principalities of Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, and the republic of San Marino.

Most theories see the nation state as a 19th-century European phenomenon, facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education, mass literacy, and mass media. However, historians also note the early emergence of a relatively unified state and identity in Portugal and the Dutch Republic. Scholars such as Steven Weber, David Woodward, Michel Foucault, and Jeremy Black have advanced the hypothesis that the nation state did not arise out of political ingenuity or an unknown undetermined source, nor was it an accident of history or political invention. Rather, the nation state is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century intellectual discoveries in political economy, capitalism, mercantilism, political geography, and geography combined with cartography and advances in map-making technologies.

Some nation states, such as Germany and Italy, came into existence at least partly as a result of political campaigns by nationalists, during the 19th century. In both cases, the territory was previously divided among other states, some of them very small. Liberal ideas of free trade played a role in German unification, which was preceded by a customs union, the Zollverein. National self-determination was a key aspect of United States President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points, leading to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, while the Russian Empire became the Soviet Union after the Russian Civil War. Decolonization lead to the creation of new nation states in place of multinational empires in the Third World.

=== Globalization ===

Political globalization began in the 20th century through intergovernmental organizations and supranational unions. The League of Nations was founded after World War I, and after World War II it was replaced by the United Nations. Various international treaties have been signed through it. Regional integration has been pursued by the African Union, ASEAN, the European Union, and Mercosur. International political institutions on the international level include the International Criminal Court, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization.

== Political science ==
The study of politics is called political science, It comprises numerous subfields, namely three: Comparative politics, international relations and political philosophy. Political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of economics, law, sociology, history, philosophy, geography, psychology, psychiatry, anthropology, and neurosciences.

Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of constitutions, political actors, legislature and associated fields. International relations deals with the interaction between nation-states as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations. Political philosophy is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers.

Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in psychology, social research, and cognitive neuroscience. Approaches include positivism, interpretivism, rational choice theory, behavioralism, structuralism, post-structuralism, realism, institutionalism, and pluralism. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, survey research, statistical analysis, case studies, experimental research, and model building.

== Political system ==

The political system defines the process for making official government decisions. It is usually compared to the legal system, economic system, cultural system, and other social systems. According to David Easton, &quot;A political system can be designated as the interactions through which values are authoritatively allocated for a society.&quot; Each political system is embedded in a society with its own political culture, and they in turn shape their societies through public policy. The interactions between different political systems are the basis for global politics.

=== Forms of government ===

Forms of government can be classified by several ways. In terms of the structure of power, there are monarchies (including constitutional monarchies) and republics (usually presidential, semi-presidential, or parliamentary).

The separation of powers describes the degree of horizontal integration between the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, and other independent institutions.

==== Source of power ====

The source of power determines the difference between democracies, oligarchies, and autocracies.

In a democracy, political legitimacy is based on popular sovereignty. Forms of democracy include representative democracy, direct democracy, and demarchy. These are separated by the way decisions are made, whether by elected representatives, referendums, or by citizen juries. Democracies can be either republics or constitutional monarchies.

Oligarchy is a power structure where a minority rules. These may be in the form of anocracy, aristocracy, ergatocracy, geniocracy, gerontocracy, kakistocracy, kleptocracy, meritocracy, noocracy, particracy, plutocracy, stratocracy, technocracy, theocracy, or timocracy.

Autocracies are either dictatorships (including military dictatorships) or absolute monarchies.

==== Vertical integration ====
In terms of level of vertical integration, political systems can be divided into (from least to most integrated) confederations, federations, and unitary states.

A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under a central federal government (federalism). In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Federations were formed first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, Australia. Compared to a federation, a confederation has less centralized power.

=== State ===

All the above forms of government are variations of the same basic polity, the sovereign state. The state has been defined by Max Weber as a political entity that has monopoly on violence within its territory, while the Montevideo Convention holds that states need to have a defined territory; a permanent population; a government; and a capacity to enter into international relations.

A stateless society is a society that is not governed by a state. In stateless societies, there is little concentration of authority; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in power and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small. Stateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.

While stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a sovereign state. In some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield little or no actual power. Over the course of history most stateless peoples have been integrated into the state-based societies around them.

Some political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achieved. A central tenet of anarchism is the advocacy of society without states. The type of society sought for varies significantly between anarchist schools of thought, ranging from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. In Marxism, Marx&#x27;s theory of the state considers that in a post-capitalist society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and wither away. A related concept is that of stateless communism, a phrase sometimes used to describe Marx&#x27;s anticipated post-capitalist society.

=== Constitutions ===
Constitutions are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative and judiciary branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate. England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the Civil War but after the Restoration abandoned them to be taken up later by the American Colonies after their emancipation and then France after the Revolution and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.

Constitutions often set out separation of powers, dividing the government into the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary (together referred to as the trias politica), in order to achieve checks and balances within the state. Additional independent branches may also be created, including civil service commissions, election commissions, and supreme audit institutions.

=== Political culture ===

Political culture describes how culture impacts politics. Every political system is embedded in a particular political culture. Lucian Pye&#x27;s definition is that, &quot;Political culture is the set of attitudes, beliefs, and sentiments, which give order and meaning to a political process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the political system.&quot;

Trust is a major factor in political culture, as its level determines the capacity of the state to function. Postmaterialism is the degree to which a political culture is concerned with issues which are not of immediate physical or material concern, such as human rights and environmentalism. Religion has also an impact on political culture.

=== Political dysfunction ===

==== Political corruption ====

Political corruption is the use of powers for illegitimate private gain, conducted by government officials or their network contacts. Forms of political corruption include bribery, cronyism, nepotism, and political patronage. Forms of political patronage, in turn, includes clientelism, earmarking, pork barreling, slush funds, and spoils systems; as well as political machines, which is a political system that operates for corrupt ends.

When corruption is embedded in political culture, this may be referred to as patrimonialism or neopatrimonialism. A form of government that is built on corruption is called a &quot;kleptocracy&quot; (&#x27;rule of thieves&#x27;).

==== Insincere politics ====
The words &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;political&quot; are sometimes used as pejoratives to mean political action that is deemed to be overzealous, performative, or insincere.

== Levels of politics ==

=== Macropolitics ===
Macropolitics can either describe political issues that affect an entire political system (e.g. the nation state), or refer to interactions between political systems (e.g. international relations).

Global politics (or world politics) covers all aspects of politics that affect multiple political systems, in practice meaning any political phenomenon crossing national borders. This can include cities, nation-states, multinational corporations, non-governmental organizations, and/or international organizations. An important element is international relations: the relations between nation-states may be peaceful when they are conducted through diplomacy, or they may be violent, which is described as war. States that are able to exert strong international influence are referred to as superpowers, whereas less-powerful ones may be called regional or middle powers. The international system of power is called the &quot;world order&quot;, which is affected by the balance of power that defines the degree of polarity in the system. Emerging powers are potentially destabilizing to it, especially if they display revanchism or irredentism.

Politics inside the limits of political systems, which in contemporary context correspond to national borders, are referred to as domestic politics. This includes most forms of public policy, such as social policy, economic policy, or law enforcement, which are executed by the state bureaucracy.

=== Mesopolitics ===

Mesopolitics describes the politics of intermediary structures within a political system, such as national political parties or movements.

A political party is a political organization that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within government, usually by participating in political campaigns, educational outreach, or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed ideology or vision, bolstered by a written platform with specific goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests.

Political parties within a particular political system together form the party system, which can be either multiparty, two-party, dominant-party, or one-party, depending on the level of pluralism. This is affected by characteristics of the political system, including its electoral system. According to Duverger&#x27;s law, first-past-the-post systems are likely to lead to two-party systems, while proportional representation systems are more likely to create a multiparty system.

=== Micropolitics ===

Micropolitics describes the actions of individual actors within the political system. This is often described as political participation. Political participation may take many forms, including:
* Activism
* Boycott
* Civil disobedience
* Demonstration
* Petition
* Picketing
* Strike action
* Tax resistance
* Voting (or its opposite, abstentionism)

=== Democracy ===

Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes. The uncertainty of outcomes is inherent in democracy. Democracy makes all forces struggle repeatedly to realize their interests and devolves power from groups of people to sets of rules.

Among modern political theorists, there are three contending conceptions of democracy: &quot;aggregative&quot;, &quot;deliberative&quot;, and &quot;radical&quot;.

==== Aggregation ====

The theory of &quot;aggregative democracy&quot; claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit the preferences of citizens, and aggregate them together to determine what social policies the society should adopt. Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on voting, where the policy with the most votes gets implemented.

Different variants of aggregative democracy exist. Under &quot;minimalism&quot;, democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not &quot;rule&quot; because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded. Joseph Schumpeter articulated this view most famously in his book &quot;Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy&quot;. Contemporary proponents of minimalism include William H. Riker, Adam Przeworski, and Richard Posner.

According to the theory of &quot;direct democracy&quot;, on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.

Governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter—with half to their left and the other half to their right. This is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. Anthony Downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book &quot;An Economic Theory of Democracy&quot;.

====Polyarchy====
Robert A. Dahl argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation. Similarly, Ronald Dworkin argues that &quot;democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal&quot;.

==== Deliberation ====
Deliberative democracy is based on the notion that democracy is government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. &quot;Authentic deliberation&quot; is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.

=== Equality ===

Equality is a state of affairs in which all people within a specific society or isolated group have the same social status, especially socioeconomic status, including protection of human rights and dignity, as well as access to certain social goods and social services. Furthermore, it may also include health equality, economic equality and other social securities. Social equality requires the absence of legally enforced social class or caste boundaries and the absence of discrimination based on by an inalienable aspect of a person&#x27;s identity. To this end, there must be equal justice under law, and equal opportunity regardless of, sex, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, origin, caste or class, income or property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, health or disability.

==== Left–right spectrum ====

A common way of understanding politics is through the left–right political spectrum, which ranges from left-wing politics via centrism to right-wing politics. This classification is comparatively recent and dates from the French Revolution, when those members of the National Assembly who supported the republic, the common people and a secular society sat on the left and supporters of the monarchy, aristocratic privilege and the Church sat on the right.

Today, the left is generally progressivist, seeking social progress in society. The more extreme elements of the left, named the far-left, tend to support revolutionary means for achieving this. This includes ideologies such as Communism and Marxism. The center-left, on the other hand, advocates for more reformist approaches, for example that of social democracy.

In contrast, the right is generally motivated by conservatism, which seeks to conserve what it sees as the important elements of society such as law and order, limited government and preserving individual freedoms. The far-right goes beyond this, and often represents a reactionary turn against progress, seeking to undo it. Examples of such ideologies have included Fascism and Nazism. The center-right may be less clear-cut and more mixed in this regard, with neoconservatives supporting the spread of free markets and capitalism, and one-nation conservatives more open to social welfare programs.

According to Norberto Bobbio, one of the major exponents of this distinction, the left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality—believing it to be unethical or unnatural, while the right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.
Some ideologies, notably Christian Democracy, claim to combine left and right-wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, &quot;In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles.&quot; Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include Fascist Terza Posizione economic politics in Italy and Peronism in Argentina.

=== Freedom ===

Political freedom (also known as political liberty or autonomy) is a central concept in political thought and one of the most important features of democratic societies. Negative liberty has been described as freedom from oppression or coercion and unreasonable external constraints on action, often enacted through civil and political rights, while positive liberty is the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions, e.g. economic compulsion, in a society. This capability approach to freedom requires economic, social and cultural rights in order to be realized.

==== Authoritarianism and libertarianism ====
Authoritarianism and libertarianism disagree the amount of individual freedom each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where &quot;individual rights and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities&quot;, while libertarians generally oppose the state and hold the individual as sovereign. In their purest form, libertarians are anarchists, who argue for the total abolition of the state, of political parties and of other political entities, while the purest authoritarians are, by definition, totalitarians who support state control over all aspects of society.

For instance, classical liberalism (also known as &quot;laissez-faire liberalism&quot;) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and limited government. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual property rights, free markets, natural rights, the protection of civil liberties, constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of John Locke, Adam Smith, David Hume, David Ricardo, Voltaire, Montesquieu and others. According to the libertarian Institute for Humane Studies, &quot;the libertarian, or &#x27;classical liberal&#x27;, perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by &#x27;as much liberty as possible&#x27; and &#x27;as little government as necessary&#x27;.&quot; For anarchist political philosopher L. Susan Brown (1993), &quot;liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual freedom yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism&#x27;s competitive property relations.&quot;

<text>Paris () is the capital and largest city of France. With an estimated population of 2,048,472 residents in January 2025 in an area of more than , Paris is the fourth-most populous city in the European Union, the ninth-most populous city in Europe and the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022. Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world&#x27;s major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy. Because of its leading role in the arts and sciences and its early adaptation of extensive street lighting, it became known as the City of Light in the 19th century.

The City of Paris is the centre of the Île-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an official estimated population of 12,271,794 inhabitants in January 2023, or about 19% of the population of France. The Paris Region had a nominal GDP of €765 billion (US$1.064 trillion when adjusted for PPP) in 2021, the highest in the European Union. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.

Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport, the third-busiest airport in Europe, and Orly Airport. Opened in 1900, the city&#x27;s subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23million passengers daily. It is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262million passengers in 2015. Paris has one of the most sustainable transportation systems and is one of only two cities in the world that received the Sustainable Transport Award twice.

Paris is known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 8.9million visitors in 2023, on track for keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world. The Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l&#x27;Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre, , Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso are noted for their collections of modern and contemporary art. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.

Paris is home to several United Nations organizations including UNESCO, as well as other international organizations such as the OECD, the OECD Development Centre, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Energy Agency, the International Federation for Human Rights, along with European bodies such as the European Space Agency, the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority. The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Français are based in Paris. The 81,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. Paris hosts the French Open, an annual Grand Slam tennis tournament, on the red clay of Roland Garros. Paris hosted the 1900, the 1924, and the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the 2007 and 2023 Rugby World Cups, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were held in Paris. Every July, the Tour de France bicycle race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.

==Etymology==

The ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius Caesar as &quot;Luteciam Parisiorum&quot; (&#x27;Lutetia of the Parisii&#x27;) and is later attested as &quot;Parision&quot; in the 5th century AD, then as &quot;Paris&quot; in 1265. During the Roman period, it was commonly known as or in Latin, and as &quot;Leukotekía&quot; in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the Celtic root &quot;*lukot-&quot; (&#x27;mouse&#x27;), or from *&quot;luto-&quot; (&#x27;marsh, swamp&#x27;).

The name &quot;Paris&quot; is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii, a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period. The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym remains debated. According to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the Celtic root &quot;pario-&quot; (&#x27;cauldron&#x27;). Alfred Holder interpreted the name as &#x27;the makers&#x27; or &#x27;the commanders&#x27;, by comparing it to the Welsh &quot;peryff&quot; (&#x27;lord, commander&#x27;), both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as *&quot;kwar-is-io&quot;-. Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert proposed to translate &quot;Parisii&quot; as the &#x27;spear people&#x27;, by connecting the first element to the Old Irish &quot;carr&quot; (&#x27;spear&#x27;), derived from an earlier *&quot;kwar-sā&quot;. In any case, the city&#x27;s name is not related to the Paris of Greek mythology.

Residents of the city are known in English as Parisians and in French as &quot;Parisiens&quot; (). They are also pejoratively called &quot;Parigots&quot; ().

==History==

===Origins===

The &quot;Parisii&quot;, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC. One of the area&#x27;s major north–south trade routes crossed the Seine on the Île de la Cité, which gradually became an important trading centre. The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins.
The Romans conquered the Paris Basin in 52 BC and began their settlement on Paris&#x27;s Left Bank. The Roman town was originally called Lutetia (more fully, &quot;Lutetia Parisiorum&quot;, &quot;Lutetia of the Parisii&quot;, modern French &quot;Lutèce&quot;). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.

By the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as &quot;Parisius&quot;, a Latin name that would later become &quot;Paris&quot; in French. Christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint Denis, the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as &quot;Mons Martyrum&quot; (Latin &quot;Hill of Martyrs&quot;), later &quot;Montmartre&quot;, from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the Basilica of Saint-Denis, and many French kings are buried there.

Clovis the Frank, the first king of the Merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508. As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the Franks to Paris and the Parisian Francien dialects were born. Fortification of the Île de la Cité failed to avert sacking by Vikings in 845, but Paris&#x27;s strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the Siege of Paris (885–886), for which the then Count of Paris (&quot;comte de Paris&quot;), Odo of France, was elected king of West Francia. From the Capetian dynasty that began with the 987 election of Hugh Capet, Count of Paris and Duke of the Franks (&quot;duc des Francs&quot;), as king of a unified West Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.

===High and Late Middle Ages to Louis XIV===

By the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France. The Palais de la Cité, the royal residence, was located at the western end of the Île de la Cité. In 1163, during the reign of Louis VII, Maurice de Sully, bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the Notre Dame Cathedral at its eastern extremity.

After the marshland between the river Seine and its slower &#x27;dead arm&#x27; to its north was filled in from around the 10th century, Paris&#x27;s cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today&#x27;s Les Halles) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de Grève (Place de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville). The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris&#x27;s river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris&#x27;s first municipal government.

In the late 12th century, Philip Augustus extended the Louvre fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares. In 1190, he transformed Paris&#x27;s former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.

With 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants. By the early fourteenth century, so much filth had collected inside urban Europe that French and Italian cities were naming streets after human waste. In medieval Paris, several street names were inspired by , the French word for &quot;shit&quot;.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420; in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city, it would remain under English occupation until 1436.

In the late 16th-century French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic League, the organisers of 24 August 1572 St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre in which thousands of French Protestants were killed. The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne Henry IV, after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris&#x27;s first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension connecting it to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. In spite of Henry IV&#x27;s efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris&#x27;s streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near Les Halles marketplace in 1610.

During the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne, and a palace for himself, the Palais-Cardinal. After Richelieu&#x27;s death in 1642, it was renamed the Palais-Royal.
Due to the Parisian uprisings during the Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court to a new palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the Comédie-Française, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the &quot;Grands Boulevards&quot;. Other marks of his reign were the Collège des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vendôme, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.

===18th and 19th centuries===

Paris grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780. A new boulevard named the Champs-Élysées extended the city west to Étoile, while the working-class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine on the eastern side of the city grew increasingly crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.

Paris was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity, known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and D&#x27;Alembert published their &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; in 1751, before the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot air balloon on 21 November 1783. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, as well the primary European centre for book publishing, fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods. On 22 October 1797, Paris was also the site of the first parachute jump in history, by Garnerin.

In the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage of the French Revolution. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, with which it stormed the Bastille, a principal symbol of royal authority. The first independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot; and elected a Mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly, on 15 July.

Louis XVI and the royal family were brought to Paris and incarcerated in the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned increasingly radical, the king, queen and mayor were beheaded by guillotine in the Reign of Terror, along with more than 16,000 others throughout France. The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city&#x27;s churches were closed, sold or demolished. A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 (&quot;coup d&#x27;état du 18 brumaire&quot;), when Napoleon Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.

The population of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but after 1799 it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000 by 1815. Napoleon replaced the elected government of Paris with a prefect that reported directly to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe, and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq, Père Lachaise Cemetery and the city&#x27;s first metal bridge, the Pont des Arts.
During the Restoration, the bridges and squares of Paris were returned to their pre-Revolution names; the July Revolution in 1830 (commemorated by the July Column on the Place de la Bastille) brought to power a constitutional monarch, Louis Philippe I. The first railway line to Paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the provinces to the city. In 1848, Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris. His successor, Napoleon III, alongside the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, launched a huge public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes. In 1860, Napoleon III annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.

During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), Paris was besieged by the Prussian Army. Following several months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. After seizing power in Paris on 28 March, a revolutionary government known as the Paris Commune held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the &quot;Bloody Week&quot; at the end of May 1871.

In the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the 1900 Universal Exposition gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the and the first Paris Métro line. Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (Émile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).

===20th and 21st centuries===

By 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000. At the beginning of the century, artists from around the world including Pablo Picasso, Modigliani, and Henri Matisse made Paris their home. It was the birthplace of Fauvism, Cubism and abstract art, and authors such as Marcel Proust were exploring new approaches to literature.

During the First World War, Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns. In the years after the war, known as &quot;Les Années Folles&quot;, Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Eva Kotchever, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Sidney Bechet and Salvador Dalí.

In the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and Léopold Sédar Senghor.
On 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been declared an &quot;open city&quot;. On 16–17 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the &quot;Vel d&#x27;Hiv&quot; (&quot;Vélodrome d&#x27;Hiver&quot;), from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. None of the children came back. On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the United States Army. General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs Élysées towards Notre Dame de Paris and made a rousing speech from the Hôtel de Ville.

In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS) carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.

In May 1968, protesting students occupied the Sorbonne and put up barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses. In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of Paris to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977, Jacques Chirac became the first elected mayor of Paris since 1793. The Tour Maine-Montparnasse, the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and high, was built between 1969 and 1973. It was highly controversial, and it remains the only building in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high. The population of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families moved to the suburbs. A suburban railway network, the RER (Réseau Express Régional), was built to complement the Métro; the Périphérique expressway encircling the city, was completed in 1973.

Most of the postwar presidents of the Fifth Republic wanted to leave their own monuments in Paris; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou (1977), Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing began the Musée d&#x27;Orsay (1986); President François Mitterrand had the Opéra Bastille built (1985–1989), the new site of the &quot;Bibliothèque nationale de France&quot; (1996), the Arche de la Défense (1985–1989) in La Défense, as well as the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983–1989); Jacques Chirac (2006), the Musée du quai Branly.

In the early 21st century, the population of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delanoë became the first socialist mayor. He was re-elected in March 2008. In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic, he introduced the Vélib&#x27;, a system which rents bicycles. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.
In 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the Grand Paris project, to integrate Paris more closely with the towns in the region around it. After many modifications, the new area, named the Metropolis of Grand Paris, with a population of 6.7 million, was created on 1 January 2016. In 2011, the City of Paris and the national government approved the plans for the Grand Paris Express, totalling of automated metro lines to connect Paris, the innermost three departments around Paris, airports and high-speed rail (TGV) stations, at an estimated cost of €35 billion. The system is scheduled to be completed by 2030.

In January 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed attacks across the Paris region. 1.5 million people marched in Paris in a show of solidarity against terrorism and in support of freedom of speech. In November of the same year, terrorist attacks, claimed by ISIL, killed 130 people and injured more than 350.
On 22 April 2016, the Paris Agreement was signed by 196 nations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in an aim to limit the effects of climate change below 2 °C.

==Geography==
===Location===
Paris is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine, whose crest includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the oldest part of Paris. The river&#x27;s mouth on the English Channel (&quot;La Manche&quot;) is about downstream from Paris. Paris is spread widely on both banks of the river. Overall, Paris is relatively flat, and the lowest point is above sea level. Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at .

Excluding the outlying parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, Paris covers an oval measuring about in area, enclosed by the ring road, the Boulevard Périphérique. Paris&#x27; last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 gave it its modern form, and created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). From the 1860 area of , the city limits were expanded marginally to in the 1920s. In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes forest parks were annexed to the city, bringing its area to about . The metropolitan area is .

Measured from the &#x27;point zero&#x27; in front of its Notre-Dame cathedral, Paris by road is southeast of London, south of Calais, southwest of Brussels, north of Marseille, northeast of Nantes, and southeast of Rouen.

===Climate===

Paris has an oceanic climate within the Köppen climate classification, typical of western Europe. This climate type features cool winters, with frequent rain and overcast skies, and mild to warm summers. Very hot and very cold temperatures and weather extremes are rare in this type of climate.

Summer days are usually mild and pleasant, with average temperatures between , and a fair amount of sunshine. Each year there are a few days when the temperature rises above . Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded for weeks, reached on some days, and rarely cooled down at night.

Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and cool nights, but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons. In winter, sunshine is scarce. Days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing, with low temperatures around . Light night frosts are quite common, but the temperature seldom dips below . Paris sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation.

Paris has an average annual precipitation of , and experiences light rainfall distributed evenly throughout the year. Paris is known for intermittent, abrupt, heavy showers. The highest recorded temperature was , on 25 July 2019. The lowest was , on 10 December 1879.
==Administration==
===City government===

For almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, Paris was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of France. In 1974, Paris was granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly. The first modern elected mayor of Paris was Jacques Chirac, elected March 1977, becoming the city&#x27;s first mayor since 1871 and only the fourth since 1794. The current mayor is Anne Hidalgo, a socialist, first elected in April 2014, and re-elected in June 2020.

The mayor of Paris is elected indirectly by Paris voters. The voters of each of the city&#x27;s 20 arrondissements elect members to the &quot;Conseil de Paris&quot; (Council of Paris), which elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members. Each arrondissement is allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements, to 34 members for the most populated. The council is elected using closed list proportional representation in a two-round system.

Party lists winning an absolute majority in the first round – or at least a plurality in the second round – automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement. The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote, using the highest averages method. This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they do not win an absolute majority of the vote.

Prior to the 2020 Paris municipal election, each of Paris&#x27;s 20 arrondissements had its own town hall and a directly elected council (), which elects an arrondissement mayor. The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris, and members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. As of 1996, there were 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors. The creation of Paris Centre, a unified administrative division with a single mayor covering the first four arrondissements, took effect with the said 2020 election. The other 16 arrondissements continue to have their own mayors.

===Métropole du Grand Paris===

In January 2016, the Métropole du Grand Paris, or simply Grand Paris, came into existence. It is an administrative structure for co-operation between the City of Paris and its nearest suburbs. It includes the City of Paris, plus the communes of the three departments of the inner suburbs, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including Argenteuil in Val d&#x27;Oise and Paray-Vieille-Poste in Essonne, which were added to include the major airports of Paris. The Metropole covers . In 2015, it had a population of 6.945 million people.

The new structure is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment. In January 2016, Patrick Ollier was elected the first president of the metropolitan council. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million people and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, it has a very small budget: just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.

===Regional government===
The Region of Île de France, including Paris and its surrounding communities, is governed by the Regional Council, composed of 209 members representing its different communes. In December 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Valérie Pécresse, narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.

===National government===

As the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France&#x27;s national government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of the French Republic resides at the Élysée Palace. The Prime Minister&#x27;s seat is at the Hôtel Matignon. Government ministries are located in various parts of the city, many near the Hôtel Matignon.

Both houses of the French Parliament are located on the Rive Gauche. The upper house, the Senate, meets in the Palais du Luxembourg. The more important lower house, the National Assembly, meets in the Palais Bourbon. The President of the Senate, the second-highest public official in France, with the President of the Republic being the sole superior, resides in the Petit Luxembourg, a smaller palace annexe to the Palais du Luxembourg.

France&#x27;s highest courts are located in Paris. The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the &quot;Île de la Cité&quot;. The Conseil d&#x27;État, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement. The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.

Paris and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations, including UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Paris Club, the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, the &quot;Organisation internationale de la Francophonie&quot;, the European Union Institute for Security Studies, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Exhibition Bureau, and the International Federation for Human Rights.

===Police force===

The security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the Prefecture of Police of Paris, a subdivision of the Ministry of the Interior. It supervises the units of the National Police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the Paris Fire Brigade. Its headquarters is on Place Louis Lépine on the Île de la Cité.

There are 43,800 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters. The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS). Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of Paris when there are demonstrations and public events. The police are supported by the National Gendarmerie, a branch of the French Armed Forces. Their police operations are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior.

Crime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.

==Cityscape==
===Urbanism and architecture===

Paris is one of the few world capitals that has rarely seen destruction by catastrophe or war. As a result, even its earliest history is visible in its streetmap, and centuries of rulers adding their respective architectural marks on the capital has resulted in an accumulated wealth of history-rich monuments and buildings whose beauty plays a large part in giving Paris the reputation it has today. At its origin, before the Middle Ages, Paris was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine. Of those, two remain today: Île Saint-Louis and the Île de la Cité. A third one is the 1827 artificially created Île aux Cygnes.

Modern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey &quot;Paris stone&quot;. They built the major parks around central Paris. The high residential population of the city centre makes Paris much different from most other major western cities.

Paris&#x27;s urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century, particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned. The Tour Montparnasse was both Paris&#x27;s and France&#x27;s tallest building since 1973, Since 2011, this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie.

===Housing===
In 2018, the most expensive residential street in Paris by average price per square metre, was Avenue Montaigne, at 22,372 euros per square metre. In 2011, the number of residences in the City of Paris was . Among these, (85.9 percent) were main residences, (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty.

Sixty-two percent of buildings date from 1949 and before, with 20 percent built between 1949 and 1974. 18 percent of Paris buildings were built after 1974. Two-thirds of the city&#x27;s 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, which is less than Île-de-France&#x27;s 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation, against 47 percent for the wider Île-de-France region. Most of Paris&#x27; population rent their residence. In 2017, social or public housing was 19.9 percent Paris&#x27; residences. Its distribution varies widely throughout Paris, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement.
In February 2019, a Paris NGO conducted its annual citywide count of homeless persons. They counted 3,641 homeless persons in Paris, of whom twelve percent were women. More than half had been homeless for more than a year. 2,885 were living in the streets or parks, 298 in train and metro stations, and 756 in other forms of temporary shelter. This was an increase of 588 persons since 2018.

===Suburbs===
Aside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport, Paris&#x27;s administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative Seine department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. To address this problem, the parent &quot;District de la région parisienne&quot; (&#x27;district of the Paris region&#x27;) was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the Paris region was renamed &quot;Île-de-France&quot; in 1977, but this abbreviated &quot;Paris region&quot; name is still commonly used today to describe the Île-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration. Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began in January 2016, when the Métropole du Grand Paris came into existence.

Paris&#x27;s disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration&#x27;s growth. Paul Delouvrier promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs &quot;mésentente&quot; when he became head of the Paris region in 1961. Two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban &quot;villes nouvelles&quot; (&quot;new cities&quot;) and the RER commuter train network.

Many other suburban residential districts (&quot;grands ensembles&quot;) were built between the 1960s and 1970s, to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population. These districts were socially mixed at first, but few residents actually owned their homes. The growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s. Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere, and their repopulation by those with more limited resources.

These areas, &quot;quartiers sensibles&quot; (&quot;sensitive quarters&quot;), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its Goutte d&#x27;Or and Belleville neighbourhoods. To the north of Paris, they are grouped mainly in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, and to a lesser extreme to the east in the Val-d&#x27;Oise department. Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley, in Évry et Corbeil-Essonnes (Essonne), in Mureaux, Mantes-la-Jolie (Yvelines), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier&#x27;s 1961 &quot;ville nouvelle&quot; political initiative.

The Paris agglomeration&#x27;s urban sociology is basically that of 19th-century Paris: the wealthy live in the west and southwest, and the middle-to-working classes are in the north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class, dotted with wealthy islands in areas of historical importance, namely Saint-Maur-des-Fossés to the east and Enghien-les-Bains to the north of Paris.

==Demographics==

The population of the City of Paris was 2,102,650 in January 2023, down from 2,165,423 in January 2022, according to the INSEE, the French statistical agency. Between 2013 and 2023, the population fell by 122,919, or about five percent. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, declared that this illustrated the &quot;de-densification&quot; of the city, creating more green space and less crowding. Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks. This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in Paris, due to short-term rentals for tourism.

Paris is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, after Berlin, Madrid and Rome. Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls &quot;urban audit core cities&quot;.
The population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921. The principal reasons are a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. Paris&#x27;s population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century. The population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.

Paris is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the &quot;agglomération Parisienne&quot;, and statistically as a &quot;unité urbaine&quot; (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration&#x27;s population of 10,785,092 in 2017 made it the largest urban area in the European Union. City-influenced commuter activity reaches further, in a statistical &quot;aire d&#x27;attraction&quot; de Paris, &quot;functional area&quot;, a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area,), that had a population of 13,024,518 in 2017, 19.6% of the population of France, and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.

In 2012, according to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union. There were 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits, the NUTS-3 statistical area, ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. In the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over 10,000 people per square kilometre, ranking among the 10 most densely populated areas of the EU.

===Migration===
Under French law, people born in foreign countries with no French citizenship at birth are defined as immigrants. In the 2012 census, 135,853 residents of the City of Paris were immigrants from Europe, 112,369 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 70,852 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 5,059 from Turkey, 91,297 from Asia outside Turkey, 38,858 from the Americas, and 1,365 from the South Pacific.

In the Paris Region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from Europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 435,339 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 69,338 from Turkey, 322,330 from Asia outside Turkey, 113,363 from the Americas, and 2,261 from the South Pacific.

In 2012, there were 8,810 British citizens and 10,019 United States citizens living in the City of Paris (Ville de Paris), and 20,466 British citizens and 16,408 United States citizens living in the entire Paris Region (Île-de-France).

In 2020–2021, about 6 million people, or 41% of the population of the Paris Region, were either immigrants (21%) or had at least one immigrant parent (20%). These figures do not include French people born in Overseas France and their direct descendants.

===Religion===

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Paris was the largest Catholic city in the world. French census data does not contain information about religious affiliation. In a 2011 survey by the Institut français d&#x27;opinion publique (IFOP), a French public opinion research organisation, 61 percent of residents of the Paris Region (Île-de-France) identified themselves as Roman Catholic. In the same survey, 7 percent of residents identified themselves as Muslims, 4 percent as Protestants, 2 percent as Jewish and 25 percent as without religion.

According to the INSEE, between 4 and 5 million French residents were born, or had at least one parent born, in a predominantly Muslim country, particularly Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. An IFOP survey in 2008 reported that, of immigrants from these predominantly Muslim countries, 25 percent went to the mosque regularly. 41 percent practised the religion, and 34 percent were believers, but did not practice the religion. In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of Paris, 1.5 million Muslims in the Île-de-France region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in France.

In 2014, the Jewish population of the Paris Region was estimated to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.

==Economy==

The economy of the City of Paris is based largely on services and commerce. Of the 390,480 enterprises in Paris, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and 3.8 percent in industry. The story is similar in the Paris Region (Île-de-France): 76.7 percent of enterprises are engaged in commerce and services, and 3.4 percent in industry.

At the 2012 census, 59.5% of jobs in the Paris Region were in market services (12.0% in wholesale and retail trade, 9.7% in professional, scientific, and technical services, 6.5% in information and communication, 6.5% in transportation and warehousing, 5.9% in finance and insurance, 5.8% in administrative and support services, 4.6% in accommodation and food services, and 8.5% in various other market services), 26.9% in non-market services (10.4% in human health and social work activities, 9.6% in public administration and defence, and 6.9% in education), 8.2% in manufacturing and utilities (6.6% in manufacturing and 1.5% in utilities), 5.2% in construction, and 0.2% in agriculture.

The Paris Region had 5.4 million salaried employees in 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 &quot;pôles d&#x27;emplois&quot; or business districts. The largest of these, in terms of number of employees, is known in French as the QCA, or &quot;quartier central des affaires&quot;. In 2010, it was the workplace of 500,000 salaried employees, about 30 percent of the salaried employees in Paris and 10 percent of those in the Île-de-France. The largest sectors of activity in the central business district were finance and insurance (16 percent of employees in the district) and business services (15 percent). The district includes a large concentration of department stores, shopping areas, hotels and restaurants, as well a government offices and ministries.

The second-largest business district in terms of employment is La Défense, just west of the city. In 2010, it was the workplace of 144,600 employees, of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance, 16 percent in business support services. Two other important districts, Neuilly-sur-Seine and Levallois-Perret, are extensions of the Paris business district and of La Défense. Another district, including Boulogne-Billancourt, Issy-les-Moulineaux and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement, is a centre of activity for the media and information technology.

In 2021, the top French companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 all have their headquarters in the Paris Region. Six are in the central business district of the City of Paris, four are close to the city in the Hauts-de-Seine Department, three are in La Défense and one is in Boulogne-Billancourt. Some companies, like Société Générale, have offices in both Paris and La Défense. The Paris Region is France&#x27;s leading region for economic activity, with a GDP of €765 billion, of which €253 billion was in Paris city. In 2021, its GDP ranked first among the metropolitan regions of the EU, and its per-capita GDP PPP was the 8th highest. While the Paris region&#x27;s population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan France in 2019, the Paris region&#x27;s GDP accounted for 32 percent of metropolitan France&#x27;s GDP.

The Paris Region economy has gradually shifted from industry to high-value-added service industries (finance, IT services) and high-tech manufacturing (electronics, optics, aerospace, etc.). The Paris region&#x27;s most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La Défense business district places Paris&#x27;s economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the , &quot;La Défense&quot; and the &quot;Val de Seine&quot;. While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and &quot;eco&quot; industries.

In the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zürich. In 2018, Paris was the most expensive city in the world with Singapore and Hong Kong. Station F is a business incubator for startups, noted as the world&#x27;s largest startup facility.

===Employment and income===

In 2007, the majority of Paris&#x27;s salaried employees filled 370,000 businesses services jobs, concentrated in the north-western 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements. Paris&#x27;s financial service companies are concentrated in the central-western 8th and 9th arrondissement banking and insurance district. Paris&#x27;s department store district in the 1st, 6th, 8th and 9th arrondissements employ ten percent of mostly female Paris workers, with 100,000 of these in the retail trade. Fourteen percent of Parisians worked in hotels and restaurants and other services to individuals.

Nineteen percent of Paris employees work for the State in either administration or education. The majority of Paris&#x27;s healthcare and social workers work at the hospitals and social housing, concentrated in the peripheral 13th, 14th, 18th, 19th and 20th arrondissements. Outside Paris, the western Hauts-de-Seine department La Défense district specialising in finance, insurance and scientific research district, employs 144,600. The north-eastern Seine-Saint-Denis audiovisual sector has 200 media firms and 10 major film studios.

Paris&#x27;s manufacturing is mostly focused in its suburbs. Paris has around 75,000 manufacturing workers, most of which are in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades. In 2015, the Paris region&#x27;s 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000. Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers. Many of these are centred in the Yvelines department, around the Renault and PSA-Citroën plants. This department alone employs 33,000. In 2014, the industry as a whole suffered a major loss, with the closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroën assembly plant.

The southern Essonne department specialises in science and technology. The south-eastern Val-de-Marne, with its wholesale Rungis food market, specialises in food processing and beverages. The Paris region&#x27;s manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries. These employ about 100,000 workers.

Incomes are higher in the Western part of Paris and in the western suburbs, than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area. While Paris has some of the richest neighbourhoods in France, it also has some of the poorest, mostly on the eastern side of the city. In 2012, 14 percent of households in Paris earned less than €977 per month, the official poverty line. Twenty-five percent of residents in the 19th arrondissement lived below the poverty line. In Paris&#x27; wealthiest neighbourhood, the 7th arrondissement, 7 percent lived below the poverty line. The unemployment rate in Paris in the 4th trimester of 2021 was six percent, compared with 7.4 percent in the whole of France. This was the lowest rate in thirteen years.

===Tourism===


Tourism continued to recover in the Paris region in 2022, increasing to 44 million visitors, an increase of 95 percent over 2021, but still 13 percent lower than in 2019.

Greater Paris, comprising Paris and its three surrounding departments, received a record 38 million visitors in 2019, measured by hotel arrivals. These included 12.2 million French visitors. Of the foreign visitors, the greatest number came from the United States (2.6 million), United Kingdom (1.2 million), Germany (981 thousand) and China (711 thousand).

In 2018, measured by the Euromonitor Global Cities Destination Index, Paris was the second-busiest airline destination in the world, with 19.10 million visitors, behind Bangkok (22.78 million) but ahead of London (19.09 million). In 2016, 393,008 workers in Greater Paris, or 12.4 percent of the total workforce, were engaged in tourism-related sectors such as hotels, catering, transport and leisure.

Paris&#x27; top cultural attractions in 2022 were the Louvre Museum (7.7 million visitors), the Eiffel Tower (5.8 million visitors), the Musée d&#x27;Orsay (3.27 million visitors) and the Centre Pompidou (3 million visitors).

In 2019, Greater Paris had 2,056 hotels, including 94 five-star hotels, with a total of 121,646 rooms. In 2019, in addition to the hotels, Greater Paris had 60,000 homes registered with Airbnb. Under French law, renters of these units must pay the Paris tourism tax. The company paid the city government 7.3 million euros in 2016.

A minuscule fraction of foreign visitors suffer from Paris syndrome, when their experiences do not meet expectations.

==Culture==
===Painting and sculpture===
For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the &quot;City of Art&quot;. Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the &quot;Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture&quot; (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France&#x27;s top art school until 1793.

Paris was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others. Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as Géricault. Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris. In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves. Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris.

The most prestigious sculptors who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era are Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of &quot;Christ the Redeemer&quot; in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol. The Golden Age of the School of Paris ended between the two world wars.

===Museums===

The Louvre received 2,8 million visitors in 2021, up from 2.7 million in 2020, holding its position as first among the most-visited museums. Its treasures include the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (&quot;La Joconde&quot;), the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; statue, and &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;. The second-most visited museum in the city in 2021, with 1.5 million visitors, was the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg, which houses the The third most visited Paris museum in 2021 was the National Museum of Natural History with 1,4 million visitors. It is famous for its dinosaur artefacts, mineral collections and its Gallery of Evolution. It was followed by the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, featuring 19th century art and the French Impressionists, which had one million visitors. Paris hosts one of the largest science museums in Europe, the Cité des sciences et de l&#x27;industrie, (984,000 visitors in 2020). The other most-visited Paris museums in 2021 were the Fondation Louis Vuitton (691,000), the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac, featuring the indigenous art and cultures of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. (616,000); the Musée Carnavalet (History of Paris) (606,000), and the , the art museum of the City of Paris (518,000).
The Musée de l&#x27;Orangerie, near both the Louvre and the Orsay, also exhibits Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, including most of Claude Monet&#x27;s large &quot;Water Lilies&quot; murals. The Musée national du Moyen Âge, or Cluny Museum, presents Medieval art. The Guimet Museum, or &quot;Musée national des arts asiatiques&quot;, has one of the largest collections of Asian art in Europe. There are also notable museums devoted to individual artists, including the Musée Picasso, the Musée Rodin and the Musée national Eugène Delacroix.

The military history of France is presented by displays at the Musée de l&#x27;Armée at Les Invalides. In addition to the national museums, run by the Ministry of Culture, the City of Paris operates 14 museums, including the Carnavalet Museum on the history of Paris, Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Palais de Tokyo, the House of Victor Hugo, the House of Balzac and the Catacombs of Paris. There are also notable private museums. The Contemporary Art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, designed by architect Frank Gehry, opened in October 2014 in the Bois de Boulogne.

===Theatre===
The largest opera houses of Paris are the 19th-century Opéra Garnier (historical Paris Opéra) and modern Opéra Bastille; the former tends toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern. In the middle of the 19th century, there were three other active and competing opera houses: the Opéra-Comique (which still exists), Théâtre-Italien and Théâtre Lyrique (which in modern times changed its profile and name to Théâtre de la Ville). Philharmonie de Paris, the modern symphonic concert hall of Paris, opened in January 2015. Another musical landmark is the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, where the first performances of Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes took place in 1913.
Theatre traditionally has occupied a large place in Parisian culture, and many of its most popular actors today are also stars of French television. The oldest and most famous Paris theatre is the Comédie-Française, founded in 1680. Run by the Government of France, it performs mostly French classics at the Salle Richelieu in the Palais-Royal. Other famous theatres include the Odéon-Théâtre de l&#x27;Europe, also a state institution and theatrical landmark; the Théâtre Mogador; and the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Montparnasse.

The music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was opened in 1889 and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the &quot;Folies Bergère&quot;. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Dalida, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland and the Grateful Dead.

The Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include &quot;Le Lido&quot;, on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly by visitors to the city.

===Literature===
The first book printed in France, &quot;Epistolae&quot; (&quot;Letters&quot;), by Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino da Barzizza), was published in Paris in 1470 by the press established by Johann Heynlin. Since then, Paris has been the centre of the French publishing industry, the home of some of the world&#x27;s best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as Boileau, Corneille, La Fontaine, Molière, Racine, Charles Perrault, several coming from the provinces, as well as the foundation of the . In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris revolved around the cafés and salons; it was dominated by Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Pierre de Marivaux and Pierre Beaumarchais.

During the 19th century, Paris was the home and subject for some of France&#x27;s greatest writers, including Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Mérimée, Alfred de Musset, Marcel Proust, Émile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Honoré de Balzac. Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; inspired the renovation of its setting, the Notre-Dame de Paris. Another of Victor Hugo&#x27;s works, &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, described the social change and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s. One of the most popular of all French writers, Jules Verne, worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library.

In the 20th century, the Paris literary community was dominated by figures such as Colette, André Gide, François Mauriac, André Malraux, Albert Camus, and, after World War II, by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Samuel Beckett, Miguel Ángel Asturias, Alejo Carpentier and, Arturo Uslar Pietri. The winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, Patrick Modiano, based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during World War II and the 1960s–1970s.

Paris is a city of books and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language publishing houses were found in Paris. It is also a city of small bookstores. There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher&#x27;s cover price.

===Music===
In the late 12th century, a school of polyphony was established at Notre-Dame. Among the Trouvères of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadours, from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of François I, in the Renaissance era, the lute became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers &quot;disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy&quot;, and a national musical printing house was established. In the Baroque-era, noted composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and François Couperin. The &quot;Conservatoire de Musique de Paris&quot; was founded in 1795. By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music.

Romantic-era composers (in Paris) include Hector Berlioz, Charles Gounod, Camille Saint-Saëns, Léo Delibes and Jules Massenet, among others. Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; premiered 3 March 1875. &quot;Carmen&quot; has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon. Among the Impressionist composers who created new works for piano, orchestra, opera, chamber music and other musical forms, stand in particular, Claude Debussy, Erik Satie and Maurice Ravel. Several foreign-born composers, such as Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, Jacques Offenbach, Niccolò Paganini, and Igor Stravinsky, established themselves or made significant contributions both with their works and their influence in Paris.

Bal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls. Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a &quot;musette&quot;) and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the cafés and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars, and Paris became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.

Paris is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city. Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.
Immediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, including the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll.

Some of the finest manouche musicians in the world are found here playing the cafés of the city at night. Some of the more notable jazz venues include the New Morning, Le Sunset, La Chope des Puces and Bouquet du Nord. Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, including the Paris Jazz Festival and the rock festival Rock en Seine. The Orchestre de Paris was established in 1967. December 2015 was the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edith Piaf—widely regarded as France&#x27;s national chanteuse, as well as being one of France&#x27;s greatest international stars.

Paris has a big hip hop scene. This music became popular during the 1980s. The presence of a large African and Caribbean community helped to its development, giving political and social status for many minorities.

===Cinema===
The movie industry was born in Paris when Auguste and Louis Lumière projected the first motion picture for a paying audience at the Grand Café on 28 December 1895. Many of Paris&#x27;s concert/dance halls were transformed into cinemas when the media became popular beginning in the 1930s. Paris&#x27;s largest cinema room today is in the Grand Rex theatre with 2,700 seats. Big multiplex cinemas have been built since the 1990s. UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles with 27 screens, MK2 Bibliothèque with 20 screens and UGC Ciné Cité Bercy with 18 screens are among the largest.

Parisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the world&#x27;s global cities, with cinemas primarily dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment. French cinema comes a close second, with major directors (&quot;réalisateurs&quot;) such as Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, and Luc Besson, and the more slapstick/popular genre with director Claude Zidi as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown and appreciated.

===Restaurants and cuisine===
Since the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants and &quot;haute cuisine&quot;, food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period. The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the Café Anglais, Maison Dorée and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the &quot;Belle Époque&quot;, including Maxim&#x27;s on Rue Royale, Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées, and the Tour d&#x27;Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle.

Today, owing to Paris&#x27;s cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has more than 9,000 restaurants. The Michelin Guide has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2018, of the 27 Michelin three-star restaurants in France, ten are located in Paris. These include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as L&#x27;Ambroisie in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such as L&#x27;Astrance, which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France&#x27;s most famous chefs, including Pierre Gagnaire, Alain Ducasse, Yannick Alléno and Alain Passard, have three-star restaurants in Paris.
Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city&#x27;s political and cultural life. The Café Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867, it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.

===Fashion===
Since the 19th century, Paris has been an international fashion capital, particularly in the domain of haute couture (clothing hand-made to order for private clients). It is home to some of the largest fashion houses in the world, including Dior and Chanel, as well as many other well-known and more contemporary fashion designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, and Christian Lacroix. Paris Fashion Week, held in January and July in the Carrousel du Louvre among other renowned city locations, is one of the top four events on the international fashion calendar. Moreover, Paris is also the home of the world&#x27;s largest cosmetics company: L&#x27;Oréal as well as three of the top five global makers of luxury fashion accessories: Louis Vuitton, Hermés, and Cartier. Most of the major fashion designers have their showrooms along the Avenue Montaigne, between the Champs-Élysées and the Seine.

===Photography===
The inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825. In 1839, after the death of Niépce, Louis Daguerre patented the Daguerrotype, which became the most common form of photography until the 1860s. The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which &quot;Le baiser de l&#x27;hôtel de ville&quot; has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, as well as others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Paul Gavarni and Alphonse Mucha.

===Media===
Paris and its close suburbs are home to numerous newspapers, magazines and publications including &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, &quot;Libération&quot;, &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot;, &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot;, &quot;La Croix&quot;, &quot;Le Parisien&quot; (in Saint-Ouen), &quot;Les Échos&quot;, &quot;Paris Match (Neuilly-sur-Seine)&quot;, &quot;Réseaux &amp; Télécoms&quot;, Reuters France, &quot;l&#x27;Équipe&quot; (Boulogne-Billancourt) and &quot;L&#x27;Officiel des Spectacles&quot;. France&#x27;s two most prestigious newspapers, &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, are the centrepieces of the Parisian publishing industry. Agence France-Presse is France&#x27;s oldest, and one of the world&#x27;s oldest, continually operating news agencies. AFP, as it is colloquially abbreviated, maintains its headquarters in Paris, as it has since 1835. France 24 is a television news channel owned and operated by the French government, and is based in Paris. Another news agency is France Diplomatie, owned and operated by the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, and pertains solely to diplomatic news and occurrences.

The most-viewed network in France, TF1, is in nearby Boulogne-Billancourt. France 2, France 3, Canal+, France 5, M6 (Neuilly-sur-Seine), Arte, D8, W9, NT1, NRJ 12, La Chaîne parlementaire, France 4, BFM TV, and Gulli are other stations located in and around the capital.

Radio France Internationale, another public broadcaster is also based in the city. Paris also holds the headquarters of the La Poste, France&#x27;s national postal carrier.

===Holidays and festivals===
Bastille Day, a celebration of the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the biggest festival in the city, is a military parade taking place every year on 14 July on the Champs-Élysées, from the Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. It includes a flypast over the Champs Élysées by the Patrouille de France, a parade of military units and equipment, and a display of fireworks in the evening, the most spectacular being the one at the Eiffel Tower.

===Sports===
Paris&#x27;s most popular sport clubs are the association football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. and the rugby union clubs Stade Français and Racing 92 (the latter based in Nanterre, a western inner suburb just outside the city proper). The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis. It is used for football, rugby union and track and field athletics. It hosts the France national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team&#x27;s home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Français rugby team. In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city and closer suburbs have a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star FC, US Créteil, RCF Paris and Stade Français Football.

Paris hosted the 1900, 1924 and 2024 Summer Olympics. The city also bid for the 1992, 2008, and 2012 Olympic Games but lost to Barcelona, Beijing, and London.

The city hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup, at the Stade Olympique de Colombes, and the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 2007 Rugby World Cup and 2023 Rugby World Cup, at the Stade de France.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===
Paris is a major rail, highway, and air transport hub. The Île-de-France Mobilités (IDFM) oversees the transit network in the region. The syndicate coordinates public transport. The RATP operates 347 bus lines, the Métro, eight tramway lines, and sections of the RER. The SNCF operates suburban rails, one tramway line and the other sections of the RER. The Optile consortium of private operators manages 1,176 bus lines.

Paris has one of the most sustainable transportation systems in the world, and is one of only two cities that received the Sustainable Transport Award twice, in 2008 and 2023. In 2022–2023, 53.3% of trips in Paris were made on foot, 30% on public transport, 11.2% on bicycles and 4.3% on cars. Bike lanes are being doubled, and electric car incentives are being created. Paris is banning the most polluting automobiles from key districts. 

====Railways====


A central hub of the national rail network, Paris&#x27;s six major railway stations (Gare du Nord, Gare de l&#x27;Est, Gare de Lyon, Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz, Gare Montparnasse, Gare Saint-Lazare) and a minor one (Gare de Bercy) are connected to three networks: high-speed rail lines (TGV, Eurostar, Intercity Express, Frecciarossa), normal speed trains (Intercités, Intercités de nuit, Nightjet, TER), and the suburban rails (Transilien). The Transilien is the commuter rail network serving Paris region, through 9 lines, 392 stations and of rails.

Since the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris&#x27;s Métro network has grown to become the city&#x27;s most widely used local transport system. In 2015, it carried about 5.23 million passengers daily. There are 16 lines, 321 stations (405 stops) and of rails. Superimposed on this is a &quot;regional express network&quot;, the RER, whose five lines, 257 stops and of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area. With over 1.4 million passengers per day RER A is the busiest metro line in Europe. The Paris region is served by a light rail network, the tramway. Opened since 1992, fourteen lines are operational. The network is long, with 278 stations.

====Air====
Paris is a major international air transport hub, and the 5th busiest airport system in the world. Paris is served by three commercial international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport, Orly Airport and Beauvais–Tillé Airport. In 2019, these three airports recorded traffic of 112 million passengers. There is also one general aviation airport, Paris–Le Bourget Airport, historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows. Charles de Gaulle Airport, located on the edge of the northern suburbs of Paris, opened to commercial traffic in 1974 and became the busiest Parisian airport in 1993. In 2023, it was the 4th busiest airport in the world by international traffic and it is the hub for the nation&#x27;s flag carrier, Air France. Beauvais-Tillé Airport, located north of Paris&#x27;s city centre, is used by charter airlines and low-cost carriers.

====Motorways====

Paris is the most important hub of France&#x27;s motorway network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways: the Périphérique, which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around Paris, the A86 motorway in the inner suburbs, and the Francilienne motorway in the outer suburbs. Paris has an extensive road network with over of highways and motorways.

====Waterways====
The Paris region is the most active water transport area in France. Most of the cargo is handled by the Ports of Paris, in facilities located around Paris. The rivers Loire, Rhine, Rhône, Meuse, and Scheldt can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the Canal Saint-Martin, Canal Saint-Denis, and the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq.

====Cycling====

There are of cycle paths and routes in Paris. These include &quot;piste cyclable&quot;, bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers, and &quot;bande cyclable&quot;, a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). Some of specially marked bus lanes are free for use by cyclists, with a protective barrier against encroachments from vehicles. Cyclists have the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. Paris has a bike sharing system called Vélib&#x27; with more than 20,000 public bicycles distributed at 1,800 parking stations.

===Electricity===
Electricity is provided to Paris through a peripheral grid, fed by multiple sources. In 2012, around 50% of electricity generated in the Île-de-France came from cogeneration energy plants. Other energy sources included thermal power (35%), waste incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power. A quarter of the city&#x27;s district heating is to come from a plant in Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and wood pellets.

===Water and sanitation===

Paris in its early history had only the rivers Seine and Bièvre for water. From 1809, the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq provided Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital. From 1857, the civil engineer Eugène Belgrand, under Napoleon III, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs.

From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris&#x27;s principal source of drinking water. The remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris&#x27;s streets. This system is still a major part of Paris&#x27;s water-supply network. Today Paris has more than of underground sewers.

Air pollution in Paris, from the point of view of particulate matter (PM10), is the highest in France with 38 μg/m3. From the point of view of nitrogen dioxide pollution, Paris has one of the highest levels in the EU.

===Parks and gardens===

Paris has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees. Two of Paris&#x27;s oldest and most famous gardens are the Tuileries Garden, created in 1564 for the Tuileries Palace and redone by André Le Nôtre between 1664 and 1672, and the Luxembourg Garden, for the Luxembourg Palace, built for Marie de&#x27; Medici in 1612, which today houses the Senate. The &quot;Jardin des plantes&quot; was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626.

Between 1853 and 1870, Emperor Napoleon III and the city&#x27;s first director of parks and gardens, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, created the Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, located at the four compass points around Paris, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris&#x27;s quarters. Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the Parc de la Villette (1987), Parc André Citroën (1992), Parc de Bercy (1997) and Parc Clichy-Batignolles (2007). One of the newest parks, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013), built on a former highway on the left bank of the Seine between the Pont de l&#x27;Alma and the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, has floating gardens.

===Cemeteries===

During the Roman era, Paris&#x27; main cemetery was located on the outskirts of the left bank settlement. This changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris&#x27;s growth, many of these, particularly the city&#x27;s largest cemetery, the Holy Innocents&#x27; Cemetery, were filled to overflowing. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris&#x27; parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris&#x27;s stone mines, today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement.

After a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution, in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits. Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of Père Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimetière parisien de Pantin, also known as Cimetière parisien de Pantin-Bobigny, the Cimetière parisien d&#x27;Ivry, and the Cimetière parisien de Bagneux. Famous people buried in Parisian cemeteries include Oscar Wilde, Frédéric Chopin, Jim Morrison, Édith Piaf and Serge Gainsbourg.

===Education===
Paris is the département with the highest proportion of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a &quot;licence&quot;-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France. 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France. Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors, teaching approximately 2.9 million students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.

The University of Paris, founded in the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its original medieval colleges. In 1970, it was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.

The Paris region hosts France&#x27;s highest concentration of the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside or inside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered &quot;grands établissements&quot;. Most of the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris. The École Normale Supérieure, PSL University has remained on rue d&#x27;Ulm in the 5th arrondissement.

In 2024, Paris is the home of prestigious universities in science and technology (Polytechnic Institute of Paris, Paris Cité University, Paris-Saclay University, Sorbonne University), political science (Sciences Po), management (HEC Paris, ESSEC Business School, ESCP Business School, INSEAD) as well as multidisciplinary universities (Paris Sciences et Lettres University).

===Healthcare===

Health care and emergency medical service in the City of Paris and its suburbs are provided by the Assistance publique – Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), a public hospital system that employs more than 90,000 people, including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators, in 44 hospitals. It is the largest hospital system in Europe. It provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and emergency medical service in 52 branches of medicine. The hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.

One of the most notable hospitals is the Hôtel-Dieu, founded in 651, the oldest hospital in Paris and the oldest worldwide still operating, although the current building is the product of a reconstruction of 1877. Other hospitals include Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, one of the largest in Europe, Hôpital Cochin, Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital, Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou, Bicêtre Hospital, Beaujon Hospital, the Curie Institute, Lariboisière Hospital, Necker–Enfants Malades Hospital, Hôpital Saint-Louis, Hôpital de la Charité and the American Hospital of Paris.

==International relations==
===International organisations===
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has had its headquarters in Paris since November 1958. Paris is also the home of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Paris hosts the headquarters of the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Banking Authority.

===Twin towns – sister cities===

Since April 1956, Paris is exclusively and reciprocally twinned with:

<text>A postmaster is the head of an individual post office, responsible for all postal activities in a specific post office. When a postmaster is responsible for an entire mail distribution organization (usually sponsored by a national government), the title of Postmaster General is commonly used. 
Responsibilities of a postmaster typically include management of a centralized mail distribution facility, establishment of letter carrier routes, supervision of letter carriers and clerks, and enforcement of the organization&#x27;s rules and procedures. The postmaster is the representative of the Postmaster General in that post office. 

In Canada, many early places are named after the first postmaster.

==History==
In the days of horse-drawn carriages, a postmaster was an individual from whom horses and/or riders (known as postilions or &quot;post-boys&quot;) could be hired. The postmaster would reside in a &quot;post house&quot;.

The first Postmaster General of the United States was the notable founding father Benjamin Franklin.

==United States==
An appointed position, postmasters were prized offices for political party members as they helped keep your political representatives in power. The appointment and removal of most postmasters was handled by the First Assistant United States Postmaster General in Washington, D.C., while postmasters who earned more than $1,000 annually were nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The system was often a patronage system, whereby the postmasters would get jobs in an informal way by the party in power.

Historically in the United States, women served as postmasters since the American Revolutionary War and even earlier, under British rule, more than a century before they won the right to vote. The wave of female postmasters appointed during the late 19th century had been a crucial element for women&#x27;s broader entry into the federal government system.

Many postmasters are members of a management organization that consults with the United States Postal Service (USPS) for compensation and policy. On November 1, 2016, the two organizations, the National Association of Postmasters of the United States (NAPUS) and the National League of Postmasters, merged to form the United Postmasters and Managers of America (UPMA).

Level of pay is based on deliveries and revenue of the post office. Levels are from EAS (Executive and Administrative Service) 18 through 26. Smaller remotely managed post offices no longer have postmasters and report to a nearby larger office. Larger metropolitan post offices are PCES (Postal Career Executive Service).

<text>A Postmaster General, in Anglosphere countries, is the chief executive officer of the postal service of that country, a ministerial office responsible for overseeing all other postmasters.

== History ==
The practice of having a government official responsible for overseeing the delivery of mail throughout the nation originated in England. A &#x27;Master of the Posts&#x27; is mentioned in the &quot;King&#x27;s Book of Payments&quot;, with a payment of £100 being authorised for Sir Brian Tuke as &#x27;Master of the King&#x27;s Post&#x27; in February 1512. In 1517, he was appointed to the office of &#x27;Governor of the King&#x27;s Posts&#x27;, a precursor to the office of Postmaster General of the United Kingdom, by Henry VIII. In 1609, it was decreed that letters could only be carried and delivered by persons authorised by the Postmaster General.

In the United Kingdom, the office of Postmaster General was abolished in 1969. It was replaced by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. In 2000, its functions were transferred to the Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).

<doc id="22994" wikidata="Q216809" url="?curid=22994" title="Paul Cohen">
<text>Paul Joseph Cohen (April 2, 1934 – March 23, 2007) was an American mathematician. He is best known for his proofs that the continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice are independent from Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, for which he was awarded a Fields Medal.

==Early life and education==
Cohen was born in Long Branch, New Jersey in 1934, into a Jewish family that had immigrated to the United States from what is now Poland; he grew up in Brooklyn. He graduated in 1950, at age 16, from Stuyvesant High School in New York City.

Cohen next studied at the Brooklyn College from 1950 to 1953, but he left without earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree when he learned that he could start his graduate studies at the University of Chicago with just two years of college. At Chicago, Cohen completed his master&#x27;s degree in mathematics in 1954 and his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1958, under supervision of Antoni Zygmund. The title of his doctoral thesis was &quot;Topics in the Theory of Uniqueness of Trigonometrical Series&quot;.

In 1957, before the award of his doctorate, Cohen was appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at the University of Rochester for a year. He then spent the academic year 1958–59 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before spending 1959–61 as a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. These were years in which Cohen made a number of significant mathematical breakthroughs. In &quot;Factorization in group algebras&quot; (1959) he showed that any integrable function on a locally compact group is the convolution of two such functions, solving a problem posed by Walter Rudin. In he made a significant breakthrough in solving the Littlewood conjecture.

Cohen was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. On June 2, 1995, Cohen received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Science and Technology at Uppsala University, Sweden.

==Career==
Cohen is noted for developing a mathematical technique called forcing, which he used to prove that neither the continuum hypothesis (CH) nor the axiom of choice can be proved from the standard Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms (ZF) of set theory. In conjunction with the earlier work of Gödel, this showed that both of these statements are logically independent of the ZF axioms: these statements can be neither proved nor disproved from these axioms. In this sense, the continuum hypothesis is undecidable, and it is the most widely known example of a natural statement that is independent from the standard ZF axioms of set theory.

For his result on the continuum hypothesis, Cohen won the Fields Medal in mathematics in 1966, and also the National Medal of Science in 1967. The Fields Medal that Cohen won continues to be the only Fields Medal to be awarded for a work in mathematical logic, as of 2022.

Apart from his work in set theory, Cohen also made many valuable contributions to analysis. He was awarded the Bôcher Memorial Prize in mathematical analysis in 1964 for his paper &quot;On a conjecture by Littlewood and idempotent measures&quot;, and lends his name to the Cohen–Hewitt factorization theorem.

Cohen was a full professor of mathematics at Stanford University. He was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1962 in Stockholm and in 1966 in Moscow.

Angus MacIntyre of the Queen Mary University of London stated about Cohen: &quot;He was dauntingly clever, and one would have had to be naive or exceptionally altruistic to put one&#x27;s &#x27;hardest problem&#x27; to the Paul I knew in the &#x27;60s.&quot; He went on to compare Cohen to Kurt Gödel, saying: &quot;Nothing more dramatic than their work has happened in the history of the subject.&quot; Gödel himself wrote a letter to Cohen in 1963, a draft of which stated, &quot;Let me repeat that it is really a delight to read your proof of the ind[ependence] of the cont[inuum] hyp[othesis]. I think that in all essential respects you have given the best possible proof &amp; this does not happen frequently. Reading your proof had a similarly pleasant effect on me as seeing a really good play.&quot;

===Continuum hypothesis===
While studying the continuum hypothesis, Cohen is quoted as saying in 1985 that he had &quot;had the feeling that people thought the problem was hopeless, since there was no new way of constructing models of set theory. Indeed, they thought you had to be slightly crazy even to think about the problem.&quot;

An &quot;enduring and powerful product&quot; of Cohen&#x27;s work on the continuum hypothesis, and one that has been used by &quot;countless mathematicians&quot; is known as &quot;forcing&quot;, and it is used to construct mathematical models to test a given hypothesis for truth or falsehood.

Shortly before his death, Cohen gave a lecture describing his solution to the problem of the continuum hypothesis at the 2006 Gödel centennial conference in Vienna.

== Death ==
Cohen and his wife, Christina (née Karls), had three sons. Cohen died on March 23, 2007, in Stanford, California, after suffering from lung disease.

<doc id="22995" wikidata="Q557" url="?curid=22995" title="Patti Smith">
<text>Patricia Lee Smith (born December 30, 1946) is an American singer, songwriter, poet, painter, author, and photographer. Her 1975 debut album &quot;Horses&quot; made her an influential member of the New York City-based punk rock movement. Smith has fused rock and poetry in her work. In 1978, her most widely known song, &quot;Because the Night,&quot; co-written with Bruce Springsteen, reached number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number five on the UK Singles Chart.

In 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the by the French Ministry of Culture. In 2007, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In November 2010, Smith won the National Book Award for her memoir &quot;Just Kids&quot;, written to fulfill a promise she made to Robert Mapplethorpe, her longtime partner and friend. She is ranked 47th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of all Time, published in 2010, and was awarded the Polar Music Prize in 2011.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born on December 30, 1946, at Grant Hospital in the Lincoln Park section of Chicago, to Beverly Smith, a jazz singer turned waitress, and Grant Smith, a Honeywell machinist. Her family is of partially Irish ancestry, and Patti is the eldest of four children, with siblings Linda, Kimberly, and Todd.

When Smith was four, the family moved from Chicago to the Germantown section of Philadelphia, then to Pitman, New Jersey, and finally settled in the Woodbury Gardens section of Deptford Township, New Jersey.

At an early age, Smith was exposed to music, including the albums &quot;Shrimp Boats&quot; by Harry Belafonte, &quot;The Money Tree&quot; by Patience and Prudence, and &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;, Bob Dylan&#x27;s fourth album, released in 1964, which her mother gave her.

In 1964, Smith graduated from Deptford Township High School, and began working in a factory. She briefly attended Glassboro State College, now Rowan University, in Glassboro, New Jersey.

==Career==

===Early performances===
In 1969, Smith went to Paris with her sister, and started busking and doing performance art. When Smith returned to Manhattan, she lived at the Hotel Chelsea with Robert Mapplethorpe. They frequented Max&#x27;s Kansas City on Park Avenue, and Smith provided the spoken word soundtrack for Sandy Daley&#x27;s art film &quot;Robert Having His Nipple Pierced&quot;, starring Mapplethorpe. The same year, Smith appeared with Jayne County in Jackie Curtis&#x27;s play &quot;Femme Fatale&quot;. She also starred in Anthony Ingrassia&#x27;s play &quot;Island&quot;. As a member of the Poetry Project, she spent the early 1970s painting, writing, and performing.

In 1969, Smith also performed in the one-act play &quot;Cowboy Mouth&quot;, which she co-wrote with Sam Shepard. The published play&#x27;s notes call for &quot;a man who looks like a coyote and a woman who looks like a crow&quot;. She wrote several poems about Shepard and her relationship with him, including &quot;for sam shepard&quot; and &quot;Sam Shepard: 9 Random Years (7 + 2)&quot;, that were published in &quot;Angel City, Curse of the Starving Class &amp; Other Plays (1976)&quot;.

On February 10, 1971, Smith, accompanied by Lenny Kaye on electric guitar, opened for Gerard Malanga, which was her first public poetry performance.

Smith was briefly considered as lead singer for Blue Öyster Cult. She contributed lyrics to several Blue Öyster Cult songs, including &quot;Debbie Denise&quot;, which was inspired by her poems &quot;In Remembrance of Debbie Denise&quot;, &quot;Baby Ice Dog&quot;, &quot;Career of Evil&quot;, &quot;Fire of Unknown Origin&quot;, &quot;The Revenge of Vera Gemini&quot;, on which she performs duet vocals, and &quot;Shooting Shark&quot;. At the time, she was romantically involved with Allen Lanier, Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s keyboardist. During these years, Smith was also a rock music journalist, writing periodically for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Creem&quot;.

===The Patti Smith Group===


In 1973, Smith teamed up again with musician and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and later added Richard Sohl on piano. The trio developed into a full band with the addition of Ivan Král on guitar and bass and Jay Dee Daugherty on drums. Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia who had moved to the US in 1966 with his parents, who were both diplomats. After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Kral decided not to return.

Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded their first single, &quot;Hey Joe/Piss Factory&quot; in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard with the addition of a spoken word piece about Patty Hearst, a fugitive heiress. The B-side describes the helpless alienation Smith felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she dreams of achieving by escaping to New York City. In a 1996 interview on artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, &quot;I had devoted so much of my girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend.&quot;

Later the same year, she performed &quot;I Wake Up Screaming&quot;, a poem, on &quot;The Whole Thing Started with Rock &amp; Roll Now It&#x27;s Out of Control&quot;, an album by The Doors&#x27; Ray Manzarek.

====Albums====

In March 1975, Smith&#x27;s group, the Patti Smith Group, began a two-month weekend set of shows at CBGB in New York City with the band Television. The Patti Smith Group was spotted by Clive Davis, who signed them to Arista Records.

Later that year, the Patti Smith Group recorded their debut album, &quot;Horses&quot;, produced by John Cale amid some tension. The album fused punk rock and spoken poetry and begins with a cover of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot;, and Smith&#x27;s opening words: &quot;Jesus died for somebody&#x27;s sins but not mine&quot;, an excerpt from &quot;Oath&quot;, one of Smith&#x27;s early poems. The austere cover photograph by Mapplethorpe has become one of rock&#x27;s classic images.

As punk rock grew in popularity, the Patti Smith Group toured the U.S. and Europe. The rawer sound of the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Radio Ethiopia&quot;, reflected this. Considerably less accessible than &quot;Horses&quot;, &quot;Radio Ethiopia&quot; initially received poor reviews. However, several of its songs have stood the test of time, and Smith still performs them live. She has said that &quot;Radio Ethiopia&quot; was influenced by the band MC5.

On January 23, 1977, while touring in support of &quot;Radio Ethiopia&quot;, Smith accidentally danced off a high stage in Tampa, Florida, and fell 15-feet onto a concrete orchestra pit, breaking several cervical vertebrae. The injury required a period of rest and physical therapy, during which she says she was able to reassess, reenergize, and reorganize her life.

The Patti Smith Group produced two further albums. &quot;Easter&quot;, released in 1978, was their most commercially successful record. It included the band&#x27;s top single &quot;Because the Night&quot;, co-written with Bruce Springsteen. &quot;Wave&quot; (1979) was less successful, although the songs &quot;Frederick&quot; and &quot;Dancing Barefoot&quot; received commercial airplay.

Through most of the 1980s, Patti lived with her family in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, and was semi-retired from music. She ultimately moved back to New York City.

====Touring and additional albums====

In June 1988, Smith released the album &quot;Dream of Life&quot;, which included the song &quot;People Have the Power&quot;.

Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg, whom she had known since her early years in New York City, urged her return to live music and touring. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995, which is chronicled in a book of photographs by Stipe.

In 1996, Smith worked with her long-time colleagues to record &quot;Gone Again,&quot; featuring &quot;About a Boy&quot;, a tribute to Kurt Cobain, the former lead singer of Nirvana who died by suicide in 1994.

The same year, she collaborated with Stipe on &quot;E-Bow the Letter&quot;, a song on R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi,&quot; which she performed live with the band. After the release of &quot;Gone Again,&quot; Smith recorded two further albums, &quot;Peace and Noise&quot; in 1997, which included the single &quot;1959&quot; about China&#x27;s invasion of Tibet, and &quot;Gung Ho&quot; in 2000, which included songs about Ho Chi Minh and Smith&#x27;s late father. Smith was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for two songs, &quot;1959&quot; and &quot;Glitter in Their Eyes&quot;.

A box set of Smith&#x27;s work up to that time, &quot;The Patti Smith Masters&quot;. was released in 1996.

In 2002, Smith released &quot;Land (1975–2002),&quot; a two-CD compilation that includes a cover of Prince&#x27;s &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;. Smith&#x27;s solo art exhibition &quot;Strange Messenger&quot; was hosted at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh on September 28, 2002.

On April 27, 2004, Smith released &quot;Trampin&#x27;&quot;, which included several songs about motherhood, partly in tribute to Smith&#x27;s mother, who died two years earlier. It was her first album on Columbia Records, which later became a sister label to her Arista Records, her previous label. Smith curated the Meltdown festival in London on June 25, 2005, in which she performed &quot;Horses&quot; live in its entirety for the first time. This live performance was released later in 2004 as &quot;Horses/Horses&quot;.

On October 15, 2006, Smith performed a 3½-hour &quot;tour de force&quot; show to close out at CBGB, which was an immensely influential New York City live music venue for much of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. At the CBGB show, Smith took the stage at 9:30 p.m. (EDT) and closed her show a few minutes after 1:00 am. Her final song was &quot;Elegie&quot;, after which she read a list of punk rock musicians and advocates who had died in the previous years, representing the last public song and words performed at the iconic venue.

In April 2007, Smith&#x27;s cover of &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; appeared on her tenth album, &quot;Twelve&quot;, an all-covers album released by Columbia Records.

In July 2008, a live album by Smith and Kevin Shields, &quot;The Coral Sea&quot;, was released.

On September 10, 2009, after a week of smaller events and exhibitions in Florence, Smith played an open-air concert at Piazza Santa Croce, commemorating her performance in the same city 30 years earlier.

Smith recorded a cover of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Words of Love&quot; for the CD &quot;Rave on Buddy Holly&quot;, a tribute album tied to Holly&#x27;s 75th birthday, which was released June 28, 2011.

She also recorded the song &quot;Capitol Letter&quot; for the official soundtrack of the second film of the &quot;Hunger Games&quot;&#x27; series &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot;.

Smith&#x27;s 11th studio album, &quot;Banga&quot;, was released in June 2012. &quot;American Songwriter&quot; wrote that, &quot;These songs aren&#x27;t as loud or frantic as those of her late 70s heyday, but they resonate just as boldly as she moans, chants, speaks and spits out lyrics with the grace and determination of Mohammad Ali in his prime. It&#x27;s not an easy listen—the vast majority of her music never has been—but if you&#x27;re a fan and/or prepared for the challenge, this is as potent, heady and uncompromising as she has ever gotten, and with Smith&#x27;s storied history as a musical maverick, that&#x27;s saying plenty.&quot; Metacritic awarded the album a score of 81, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Also in 2012, Smith recorded a cover of &quot;Io come persona&quot; by Italian singer-songwriter Giorgio Gaber.

In 2015, Smith wrote &quot;Aqua Teen Dream&quot; to commemorate the series finale of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;. The vocal track was recorded in a hotel overlooking Lerici&#x27;s Bay of Poets. On September 26, 2015, Smith performed at the American Museum of Tort Law convocation ceremony.

On December 6, 2015, she made an appearance at the Paris show of U2&#x27;s Innocence + Experience Tour, performing &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;People Have the Power&quot; with U2.

On December 10, 2016, Smith attended the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm on behalf of Bob Dylan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, who could not be present due to prior commitments.

After the official presentation speech for the literary prize by Horace Engdahl, the perpetual secretary of the Swedish Academy, Smith sang the Dylan song &quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s a-Gonna Fall&quot;. She missung one verse, singing, &quot;I saw the babe that was just bleedin&#x27;,&quot; and was momentarily unable to continue. After a brief apology, saying that she was nervous, she resumed the song and earned jubilant applause at its end.

===Art and writings===
In 1994, Smith began devoting time to what she terms &quot;pure photography&quot;, a method of capturing still objects without using a flash.

From November 2006 to January 2007, an exhibition called &#x27;Sur les Traces&#x27; at Trolley Gallery, London, featured polaroid prints taken by Smith and donated to Trolley to raise awareness and funds for the publication of &quot;Double Blind: Lebanon Conflict 2006,&quot; a book with photographs by Paolo Pellegrin, a member of Magnum Photos. She also participated in the DVD commentary for &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot;.

Smith also headlined a benefit concert headed by bandmate Tony Shanahan, for Court Tavern in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Smith&#x27;s set included &quot;Gloria&quot;, &quot;Because the Night&quot;, and &quot;People Have the Power&quot;.

In 2011, Smith announced the first museum exhibition of her photography in the U.S., &quot;Camera Solo&quot;. She named the project after a sign she saw in the abode of Pope Celestine V, which translates as &quot;a room of one&#x27;s own&quot;, and which Smith felt best described her solitary method of photography. The exhibition featured artifacts that were everyday items or places of significance to artists Smith admires, including Rimbaud, Charles Baudelaire, John Keats, and William Blake. In February 2012, she was a guest at the Sanremo Music Festival.

Also in 2011, Smith was working on a crime novel set in London. &quot;I&#x27;ve been working on a detective story that starts at the St Giles in the Fields church in London for the last two years&quot;, she told NME, adding that she &quot;loved detective stories&quot; and was a fan of British fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and U.S. crime author Mickey Spillane in her youth.

===Film appearances===
Also in 2010, Smith made a cameo appearance in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Film Socialisme&quot;, which was first screened at the Cannes Film Festival that year.

Later that year, she released her latest book, &quot;Year of the Monkey&quot;. &quot;A captivating, redemptive chronicle of a year in which Smith looked intently into the abyss&quot;, stated &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;.

In 2024, Smith appeared as herself in &quot;Turn in the Wound&quot;, a documentary by Abel Ferrara about performance, poetry, music and the experience of people at war, focusing on life in Kyiv since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. She composed the music of the film and read poems by Antonin Artaud, René Daumal and Arthur Rimbaud in her own voice. It was premiered at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival on February 16, 2024.

===Musical influence===
One of the first musicians to reference Smith was Todd Rundgren. In the liner notes of his 1972 album &quot;Something/Anything?&quot;, Rundgren wrote that &quot;Song of the Viking&quot; was &quot;written in the feverish grip of the dreaded &#x27;d&#x27;oyle carte,&#x27; a chronic disease dating back to my youth. Dedicated to Miss Patti Lee Smith.&quot; Seven years later, Rundgren produced the final Patti Smith Group album, &quot;Wave&quot;.

In 1979, Gilda Radner portrayed a character called Candy Slice, based on Smith, on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Anglo-Celtic rock band The Waterboys&#x27; debut single, &quot;A Girl Called Johnny&quot;, is a tribute to Smith.

Hole&#x27;s &quot;Violet&quot;, released in 1994, features the lyrics, &quot;And the sky was all violet / I want it again, but violent, more violent,&quot; alluding to lyrics from Smith&#x27;s song &quot;Kimberly&quot;. In 2010, Hole singer Courtney Love said that she considered Smith&#x27;s &quot;Rock N Roll Nigger&quot; the greatest rock song of all time, and credited Smith as a major influence. Love received Smith&#x27;s album &quot;Horses&quot; in juvenile hall as a teenager, and &quot;realized that you could do something that was completely subversive that didn&#x27;t involve violence [or] felonies. I stopped making trouble.&quot;

In 1998, Michael Stipe of R.E.M. published a collection of photos, titled &quot;Two Times Intro: On the Road with Patti Smith.&quot; Stipe sings backing vocals on Smith&#x27;s &quot;Last Call&quot; and &quot;Glitter in Their Eyes&quot;. Smith sang background vocals on R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;E-Bow the Letter&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. A decade later, in 2008, Stipe say that Smith&#x27;s album &quot;Horses&quot; was one of his inspirations. &quot;I decided then that I was going to start a band,&quot; Stipe said about the impact of listening to &quot;Horses&quot;.

In 2000, the Australian alternative rock band The Go-Betweens dedicated the song &quot;When She Sang About Angels&quot; on their album &quot;The Friends of Rachel Worth&quot; to Smith.

In 2004, Shirley Manson of Garbage spoke of Smith&#x27;s influence on her in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s issue &quot;The Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, in which Smith was ranked 47th. The Smiths members Morrissey and Johnny Marr share an appreciation for Smith&#x27;s &quot;Horses,&quot; and revealed that their song &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; is a reworking of one of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Kimberly&quot;. In 2004, Sonic Youth released an album called &quot;Hidros 3 (to Patti Smith)&quot;.

In 2005, U2 cited Smith as an influence. The same year, Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall released &quot;Suddenly I See&quot;, a single, as a tribute of sorts to Smith. Canadian actor Elliot Page frequently mentions Smith as one of his idols and has done various photo shoots replicating famous Smith photos, and Irish actress Maria Doyle Kennedy often refers to Smith as a major influence.

&quot;She was the epitome of a literate, intelligent woman taking charge and being respected by her peers,&quot; observed Maria McKee in 2005.

In 2012, Madonna named Smith as one of her biggest influences.

In 2012, Smith was awarded an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Following conferral of her degree, Smith delivered the commencement address and played two songs along with long-time band member Lenny Kaye. In her Pratt Institute commencement address, Smith said that when she moved to New York City in 1967, she would never have been accepted into Pratt but most of her friends, including Mapplethorpe, were students at Pratt, and she spent countless hours on the Pratt campus. She added that it was through her friends and Pratt professors that she learned many of her own artistic skills.

In 2018, the English band Florence and the Machine dedicated the &quot;High as Hope&quot; album song &quot;Patricia&quot; to Smith. The lyrics reference Smith as Florence Welch&#x27;s &quot;North Star&quot;. Canadian country musician Orville Peck cited Smith as having had a big impact on him, stating that Smith&#x27;s album &quot;Horses&quot; introduced him to a new and different way to make music.

In the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Smith supported the Green Party and backed Ralph Nader. She led the crowd singing &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and &quot;People Have the Power&quot; at the campaign&#x27;s rallies, and also performed at several of Nader&#x27;s subsequent &quot;Democracy Rising&quot; events. Smith was a speaker and singer at the first protests against the Iraq War as U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. Smith supported Democratic candidate John Kerry in the 2004 election. Bruce Springsteen continued performing her &quot;People Have the Power&quot; at Vote for Change campaign events. In the winter of 2004–2005, Smith toured again with Nader in a series of rallies against the Iraq War and called for the impeachment of Bush.

In September 2006, Smith premiered two new protest songs in London. Louise Jury, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, characterized them as &quot;an emotional indictment of American and Israeli foreign policy&quot;. The song &quot;Qana&quot; was about the Israeli airstrike on the Lebanese village of Qana. &quot;Without Chains&quot; is about Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen who was born and raised in Germany, held at Guantanamo Bay detainment camp for four years. Jury&#x27;s article quotes Smith as saying:

In a 2009 interview, Smith stated that Kurnaz&#x27;s family had contacted her and that she wrote a short preface for the book that he was writing, which was released in March 2008.

In March 2003, ten days after the murder of Rachel Corrie, Smith appeared in Austin, Texas and performed an anti-war concert, and subsequently wrote &quot;Peaceable Kingdom&quot;, a song inspired by and dedicated to Corrie.

Smith regards climate change as the predominant issue of our time, and performed at the opening of COP26 in 2021.

In May 2021, more than 600 musicians, including Patti Smith, added their signature to an open letter calling for a boycott of performances in Israel until the occupation of the Palestinian territories comes to an end.

On February 24, 2022, Smith performed at The Capitol Theatre (Port Chester, New York) for the first time, saying, &quot;I would be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t affected by what is happening in the world&quot; referencing the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier that day. &quot;Peace as we know it is over in Europe&quot;, she said. &quot;This is what I heard in my sleep and goes through my head all day all night long like a tragic hit song. A raw translation of the Ukrainian anthem that the people are singing through defiant tears&quot;, she wrote on Instagram on March 6, 2022.

==Beliefs==
=== Religion ===
Smith was raised a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness and had a strong religious upbringing and a Biblical education. She says she left organized religion as a teenager because she found it too confining. This experience inspired her lyrics, &quot;Jesus died for somebody&#x27;s sins, but not mine&quot;, which appear on her cover version of &quot;Gloria&quot; by Them. She has described having an avid interest in Tibetan Buddhism around the age of 11 or 12, saying &quot;I fell in love with Tibet because their essential mission was to keep a continual stream of prayer,&quot; but that as an adult she sees clear parallels between different forms of religion and has concluded that religious dogmas are &quot;…man-made laws that you can either decide to abide by or not.&quot;

In 2014, she was invited by Pope Francis to play at Vatican Christmas concert. &quot;It&#x27;s a Christmas concert for the people, and it&#x27;s being televised. I like Pope Francis and I&#x27;m happy to sing for him. Anyone who would confine me to a line from 20 years ago is a fool! I had a strong religious upbringing, and the first word on my first LP is Jesus. I did a lot of thinking. I&#x27;m not against Jesus, but I was 20 and I wanted to make my own mistakes and I didn&#x27;t want anyone dying for me. I stand behind that 20-year-old girl, but I have evolved. I&#x27;ll sing to my enemy! I don&#x27;t like being pinned down and I&#x27;ll do what the fuck I want, especially at my age...oh, I hope there&#x27;s no small children here!&quot; she said.

In 2021, she performed at the Vatican again, telling &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; that she studied Francis of Assisi when Pope Benedict XVI was still the pope. Smith called Francis of Assisi &quot;truly the environmentalist saint&quot; and said that despite not being a Catholic, she had hoped for a pope named Francis.

===Feminism===
According to biographer Nick Johnstone, Smith has often been &quot;revered&quot; as a &quot;feminist icon&quot;, including by &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Simon Hattenstone in a 2013 profile on the musician.

In 2014, Smith offered her opinion on the sexualization of women in music. &quot;Pop music has always been about the mainstream and what appeals to the public. I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s my place to judge.&quot; Smith historically and presently declines to embrace feminism, saying, &quot;I have a son and a daughter, people always talk to me about feminism and women&#x27;s rights, but I have a son too—I believe in human rights.&quot;

In 2015, writer Anwen Crawford observed that Smith&#x27;s &quot;attitude to genius seems pre-feminist, if not anti-feminist; there is no democratizing, deconstructing impulse in her work. True artists, for Smith, are remote, solitary figures of excellence, wholly dedicated to their art.&quot;

==Awards==
In July 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture. In addition to Smith&#x27;s influence on rock music, the Minister noted Smith&#x27;s appreciation of Arthur Rimbaud. In August 2005, Smith gave a literary lecture about the poems of Rimbaud and William Blake.

On March 12, 2007, Smith was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She dedicated her award to the memory of her late husband, Fred, and performed a cover of The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;. As the closing number of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, Smith&#x27;s &quot;People Have the Power&quot; was used for the big celebrity jam that traditionally ends the program.

In 2008, &quot;Patti Smith: Dream of Life&quot;, a documentary about Smith by Steven Sebring, was released. Also in 2008, Rowan University awarded Smith with an honorary doctorate degree for her contributions to popular culture.

In 2011, Smith was one of several Polar Music Prize winners. She made her television acting debut at age 64 on the TV series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, appearing in an episode titled &quot;Icarus&quot;.

In 2024, Smith, along with Yoko Ono and Sandra Bloodworth, was awarded the Municipal Art Society of New York’s highest honor, the Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal. The Medal is awarded annually to individuals who, through vision, leadership, and philanthropy, have made a lasting contribution to New York City.

==Personal life==

In 1967, 20-year-old Smith left Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) and moved to Manhattan, where she began working at Scribner’s bookstore with friend and poet Janet Hamill. On April 26, 1967, at age 20, Smith gave birth to her first child, a daughter, and placed her for adoption.

While working at the bookstore she met photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, with whom she began an intense romantic relationship, which was tumultuous as the pair struggled with poverty and Mapplethorpe&#x27;s sexuality. Smith used Mapplethorpe&#x27;s photographs of her as covers for her albums, and she wrote essays for several of his books, including his posthumous &quot;Flowers,&quot; at his request. The two remained friends until Mapplethorpe&#x27;s death in 1989.

Smith considers Mapplethorpe to be among the most influential and important people in her life. She calls him &quot;the artist of my life&quot; in her book &quot;Just Kids,&quot; which tells the story of their relationship. Her book and album &quot;The Coral Sea&quot; is an homage to Mapplethorpe.

In 1979, at approximately age 32, Smith separated from her long-time partner Allen Lanier and met Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith, the former guitar player for Michigan-based rock band MC5 and Sonic&#x27;s Rendezvous Band. Like Patti, Fred adored poetry. &quot;Dancing Barefoot&quot;, which was inspired by Jeanne Hébuterne and her tragic love for Amedeo Modigliani, and &quot;Frederick&quot; were both dedicated to him. A running joke at the time was that she married Fred only because she would not have to change her name. They had a son, Jackson (b. 1982), who went on to marry Meg White, drummer for The White Stripes, from 2009 to 2013, and a daughter, Jesse Paris (b. 1987), who is a musician and composer.

Fred Smith died of a heart attack on November 4, 1994. Shortly afterward, Patti faced the unexpected death of her brother Todd.

<text>Horses is the debut studio album by American musician Patti Smith, released on November 10, 1975 by Arista Records. Smith, supported by her regular backing band, recorded the album at Electric Lady Studios in September 1975, choosing former Velvet Underground member John Cale as the album&#x27;s producer.

The music on &quot;Horses&quot; was informed by the minimalist aesthetic of the punk rock genre, then in its formative years. Smith and her band composed the album&#x27;s songs using simple chord progressions, while also breaking from punk tradition in their propensity for improvisation and embrace of ideas from avant-garde and other musical styles. With &quot;Horses&quot;, Smith drew upon her backgrounds in rock music and poetry, aiming to create an album combining both forms. Her lyrics were alternately rooted in her own personal experiences, particularly with her family, and in more fantastical imagery. &quot;Horses&quot; was additionally inspired by Smith&#x27;s reflections on the previous era of rock music—with two of its songs being adapted in part from 1960s rock standards, and others containing lyrical allusions and tributes to past rock performers—and her hopes for the music&#x27;s future.

At the time of its release, &quot;Horses&quot; experienced modest commercial success and reached the top 50 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, while being widely acclaimed by music critics. Recognized as a seminal recording in the history of punk and later rock movements, &quot;Horses&quot; has appeared in numerous lists of the greatest albums of all time. In 2009, it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation into the National Recording Registry as a &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; work.

==Background==
Patti Smith and her backing band gave frequent live performances throughout 1974, and by the following year they had established themselves as a popular act within the New York City underground rock music scene, especially elevated in early 1975 by their highly attended two-month residency at the New York City club CBGB with the band Television. The hype surrounding the residency brought Smith to the attention of music industry executive Clive Davis, who was scouting for artists to sign to his recently launched label Arista Records. After being impressed by one of her live performances at CBGB, Davis offered Smith a seven-album recording deal with Arista, and she signed to the label in April 1975.

Smith had written poetry for several years before becoming a musician, and entered the music industry because she thought &quot;the presentation of poetry wasn&#x27;t vibrant enough&quot;. For her debut album, her primary aim was to merge poetry and rock music, which then developed into a &quot;larger mission&quot; to &quot;pump blood back into the heart of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot;. The title &quot;Horses&quot; reflected Smith&#x27;s desire for a rejuvenation of rock music, which she found had grown &quot;calm&quot; in reaction to the social turmoil of the 1960s and the deaths of numerous prominent rock musicians of that era. &quot;Psychologically, somewhere in our hearts,&quot; she stated shortly after the album&#x27;s release, &quot;we were all screwed up because those people died... We all had to pull ourselves together. To me, that&#x27;s why our record&#x27;s called &quot;Horses&quot;. We had to pull the reins on ourselves to recharge ourselves... We&#x27;ve gotten ourselves back together. It&#x27;s time to let the horses loose again. We&#x27;re ready to start moving again.&quot;

Smith later reflected that she had envisioned &quot;Horses&quot; as a record bridging the &quot;great artists that we had just lost&quot; and the next generation of rockers, who she hoped would &quot;be less materialistic, more bonded with the people and not so glamorous&quot;, and that from a more humanistic perspective, she had also aimed &quot;to reach out to other disenfranchised people&quot; like herself. Smith said, &quot;I was consciously trying to make a record that would make a certain type of person not feel alone. People who were like me, different... I wasn&#x27;t targeting the whole world. I wasn&#x27;t trying to make a hit record.&quot;

==Recording==
Arista arranged for Smith to begin recording her debut album in August 1975. At Smith&#x27;s suggestion, the label planned to book studio time for Smith with producer Tom Dowd at Criteria in Miami, but Dowd&#x27;s close association with rival label Atlantic Records stalled these plans. Smith had a change of heart and instead set out to enlist Welsh musician John Cale, formerly of the New York City rock band the Velvet Underground, to produce &quot;Horses&quot; after she was impressed by the raw sound of his solo albums, such as 1974&#x27;s &quot;Fear&quot;. Cale accepted, already familiar with Smith&#x27;s band and being acquainted with the band&#x27;s bassist Ivan Král.

&quot;Horses&quot; was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, with Smith retaining the same backing band with whom she performed live at the time—Jay Dee Daugherty on drums, Lenny Kaye on guitar, Ivan Král on bass guitar, and Richard Sohl on keyboards. For the album, Smith and her band recorded several songs that were already fixtures of their sets at CBGB, including &quot;Gloria&quot;, &quot;Redondo Beach&quot;, &quot;Birdland&quot;, and &quot;Land&quot;. Allen Lanier of Blue Öyster Cult and Tom Verlaine of Television participated in the recording sessions as guest musicians, performing on the songs &quot;Elegie&quot; and &quot;Break It Up&quot;, respectively.

The first studio session was held on September 2. Cale later recalled that the band initially &quot;sounded awful&quot; and played out of tune due to their use of damaged instruments, compelling him to procure the band new instruments before commencing recording. The differences between the work process of Cale, who was an experienced recording artist, and the process of Smith, who at that point was primarily a live performer, became apparent in the early stages of recording and were a source of tension between the two artists, who frequently clashed in the studio. Lenny Kaye also highlighted the irreconcilable differences between their musical visions for the album, with Cale picturing &quot;a more arranged record, one fleshed out with intriguing sound palettes and melodic lines&quot;, and Smith and her band preferring a more spontaneous approach to playing their material, akin to their live performances. The final album was ultimately informed by both perspectives, making use of multitracking and overdubbing on its more structured songs, while still capturing the musical improvisation that typified the band&#x27;s live act. Cale wished to augment the band&#x27;s approach on certain songs with string instruments, but Smith vehemently opposed this idea. Lanier, who was Smith&#x27;s boyfriend at the time, did not get along with Cale, nor—particularly so—with Verlaine, who had previously dated Smith. This tension culminated with Lanier and Verlaine getting into a physical altercation during the final session, held on September 18.

For several years after the album&#x27;s release, Smith often downplayed Cale&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Horses&quot; and suggested that she and her band had ignored his suggestions entirely. In a 1976 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Smith described her experience:

Cale said in 1996 that Smith initially struck him as &quot;someone with an incredibly volatile mouth who could handle any situation&quot;, and that as producer on &quot;Horses&quot; he wanted to capture the energy of her live performances, noting that there &quot;was a lot of power in Patti&#x27;s use of language, in the way images collided with one another.&quot; He likened their working relationship during recording to &quot;an immutable force meeting an immovable object.&quot; Smith would later attribute much of the tension between herself and Cale to her inexperience with formal studio recording, recalling that she was &quot;very, very suspicious, very guarded and hard to work with&quot; and &quot;made it difficult for him to do some of the things he had to do.&quot; She expressed gratitude for Cale&#x27;s persistence in working with her and her band, and found that his production made the most out of their &quot;adolescent and honest flaws&quot;.

==Musical style==
Smith characterized &quot;Horses&quot; as &quot;three-chord rock merged with the power of the word&quot;. &quot;Consequence&quot;″s Lior Phillips noted that the minimalist quality of the album&#x27;s music &quot;matched the tone of&quot; the nascent punk rock genre, which had emerged in New York City in the mid-1970s, and counted Smith, Television, and fellow CBGB regulars such as the Ramones as practitioners. Author Joe Tarr identified a punk sensibility in the music&#x27;s reliance on simple chord progressions, and William Ruhlmann of AllMusic also cited Lenny Kaye&#x27;s rudimentary guitar playing and the &quot;anarchic spirit&quot; of Smith&#x27;s vocals as being representative of punk. Tarr wrote that the band &quot;proudly flaunted a garage rock aesthetic&quot; on &quot;Horses&quot;, while Smith &quot;sang with the delirious release of an inspired amateur&quot;, emphasizing &quot;honest passion&quot; over technical proficiency. Smith&#x27;s vocals on the album alternate between being sung and spoken, an approach that, according to Peter Murphy of &quot;Hot Press&quot;, &quot;challenged the very notion of a demarcation&quot; between the two forms.

AllMusic critic Steve Huey observed that &quot;Horses&quot; borrowed ideas from the avant-garde, with the music showcasing the band&#x27;s free jazz-inspired interplay and improvisation, while still remaining &quot;firmly rooted in primal three-chord rock &amp; roll.&quot; He called &quot;Horses&quot; &quot;essentially the first art punk album.&quot; Smith and her band&#x27;s musical improvisation differentiated them from most of their punk contemporaries, whose songs rarely diverged from straightforward three-chord structures. Throughout &quot;Horses&quot;, they also tempered their punk sound with elements of other musical styles, balancing more conventional rock songs with excursions into reggae (&quot;Redondo Beach&quot;) and jazz (&quot;Birdland&quot;).

==Lyrics==
Fiona Sturges of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Smith&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Horses&quot; as being steeped in &quot;intricate phrasing and imagery&quot; that &quot;deliberately blurred the lines between punk and poetry&quot;, while CMJ writer Steve Klinge found that they recalled the energy of Beat poetry and the &quot;revolutionary spirit&quot; of French poet Arthur Rimbaud, one of Smith&#x27;s primary influences. Smith drew on different sources of lyrical inspiration for &quot;Horses&quot;, with some songs being autobiographical and others being rooted in dreams and fantastical scenarios. She left the genders of the songs&#x27; protagonists ambiguous, a stylistic choice she said was &quot;learnt from Joan Baez, who often sang songs that had a male point of view&quot;, while also serving as a declaration &quot;that as an artist, I can take any position, any voice, that I want.&quot;

Smith&#x27;s experiences with her family inspired specific songs on &quot;Horses&quot;. &quot;Redondo Beach&quot;, whose lyrics concern a woman who commits suicide following a quarrel with the song&#x27;s narrator, was written by Smith after an incident involving her and her sister Linda. The two had gotten into a heated argument, prompting Linda to leave their shared apartment and not return until the next day. &quot;Kimberly&quot; is a dedication to its namesake, Smith&#x27;s younger sister, and finds the singer recounting a childhood memory of holding Kimberly in her arms during a lightning storm. In &quot;Free Money&quot;, Smith describes growing up in poverty in New Jersey and recalls her mother fantasizing about winning the lottery.

Other songs were penned by Smith about notable public figures. &quot;Birdland&quot; was inspired by &quot;A Book of Dreams&quot;, a 1973 memoir of Austrian psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich by his son Peter, and revolves around a narrative in which Peter, at his father&#x27;s funeral, imagines leaving on a UFO piloted by his father&#x27;s spirit. &quot;Break It Up&quot; was written about Jim Morrison, lead singer of the Doors; its lyrics are based on Smith&#x27;s recollection of her visit to Morrison&#x27;s grave in Père Lachaise Cemetery, as well as a dream in which she witnessed a winged Morrison stuck to a marble slab, trying and eventually succeeding in breaking free from the stone. &quot;Elegie&quot; is a requiem for rock musician Jimi Hendrix and quotes a line from his 1968 song &quot;1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)&quot;. It was recorded, at Smith&#x27;s request, on the fifth anniversary of Hendrix&#x27;s death, which fell on September 18, the final day of recording. Smith said that the song was also intended to pay tribute to other deceased rock artists such as Jim Morrison, Brian Jones, and Janis Joplin.

Two songs on &quot;Horses&quot; are partial adaptations of rock standards: &quot;Gloria&quot;, a radical reimagining of the 1964 Them song incorporating verses from Smith&#x27;s own poem &quot;Oath&quot;, and &quot;Land&quot;, which features the first verse of Chris Kenner&#x27;s 1962 song &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot;. In &quot;Land&quot;, Smith weaves the imagery of the Kenner song into an elaborate narrative about a character named Johnny—an allusion to the similarly named homoerotic protagonist of the 1971 William S. Burroughs novel &quot;The Wild Boys&quot;—while additionally referencing Arthur Rimbaud and, indirectly, Jimi Hendrix, whom Smith imagined to be the song&#x27;s protagonist, &quot;dreaming a simple rock-and-roll song, and it takes him into all these other realms.&quot; The characterization of Johnny in &quot;Land&quot; was also inspired by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe—who was a close friend of Smith and shot the picture of her used for the &quot;Horses&quot; album cover—and his experiences in the New York S&amp;M scene; in her memoir &quot;Just Kids&quot; (2010), Smith refers to Mapplethorpe and Burroughs, sitting together in CBGB, as &quot;Johnny and the horse&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover photograph for &quot;Horses&quot; was taken by Robert Mapplethorpe at the Greenwich Village penthouse apartment of his partner Sam Wagstaff. Smith, shrouded in natural light, is seen wearing a plain white shirt, which she had purchased at a Salvation Army shop on the Bowery, and slinging a black jacket over her shoulder and her favorite black ribbon around her collar. Embedded on the jacket is a horse pin that Allen Lanier had given her. Smith described her appearance as recalling those of French poet Charles Baudelaire and, in the slinging of the jacket, American singer and actor Frank Sinatra. She recounted that Mapplethorpe &quot;took, like, twelve pictures, and at about the eighth one, he said, &#x27;I have it.&#x27; I said, &#x27;How do you know?&#x27; and he said, &#x27;I just know,&#x27; and I said, &#x27;Okay.&#x27; And that was it.&quot;

The black-and-white treatment and androgynous pose were a departure from the typical promotional images of female singers of the time. Arista executives wanted to make various changes to the photograph, but Smith overruled their suggestions. Clive Davis wrote in 2013 that he was initially conflicted about the image, recognizing its &quot;power&quot; but feeling that it would confuse audiences unfamiliar with Smith and her style of music. He put aside his reservations and approved the cover after realizing that he needed &quot;to trust her artistic instincts thoroughly&quot;.

Feminist writer Camille Paglia later referred to the &quot;Horses&quot; cover photograph as &quot;one of the greatest pictures ever taken of a woman.&quot; In 2017, &quot;World Cafe&quot; presenter Talia Schlanger wrote that &quot;Smith&#x27;s unapologetic androgyny predates a time when that was an en vogue or even available option for women, and represents a seminal moment in the reversal of the female gaze. Smith is looking at you, and could care less what you think about looking at her. That was radical for a woman in 1975. It is still radical today.&quot; Smith herself stated that she had not intended to make a &quot;big statement&quot; with the cover, which she said simply reflected the way she dressed. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t thinking that I was going to break any boundaries. I just like dressing like Baudelaire,&quot; she remarked in 1996.

==Release==
===Promotion and sales===
On September 18, 1975, the same day that they finished recording &quot;Horses&quot;, Smith and her band performed a promotional live concert at an Arista convention held at the New York City Center, where they were personally introduced by Clive Davis. They previewed five songs from the album: &quot;Birdland&quot;, &quot;Redondo Beach&quot;, &quot;Break It Up&quot;, &quot;Land&quot;, and, as their encore, &quot;Free Money&quot;. Lisa Robinson reported afterward in &quot;NME&quot; that the &quot;stupendous, truly exciting&quot; performance was met with a highly ecstatic response from the Arista executives in attendance.

&quot;Horses&quot; was released on November 10, 1975. Smith had originally requested for the album to be issued on October 20, the birthday of Arthur Rimbaud, but due to a shortage of vinyl, the release date was postponed, in what Smith described as a &quot;magical&quot; coincidence, to November 10, the anniversary of Rimbaud&#x27;s death. Commercially, it performed respectably for a debut album, despite receiving little radio airplay. In the United States, &quot;Horses&quot; peaked at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, remaining on the chart for 17 weeks. The album also managed chart placings in Australia, where it reached number 80; Canada, where it reached number 52; and the Netherlands, where it reached number 18. To promote &quot;Horses&quot;, Smith and her band toured the US and made their network television debut performing on the NBC variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, then traveled to Europe for an appearance on the BBC Two music show &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and a short tour. &quot;Gloria&quot; was released as a single in April 1976. Smith&#x27;s cover of the Who&#x27;s &quot;My Generation&quot;, performed live in Cleveland, served as the single&#x27;s B-side.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Horses&quot; was met with near-universal acclaim from critics. Music journalist Mary Anne Cassata said that it was roundly hailed as &quot;one of the most original first albums ever recorded.&quot; Reviewing the album for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, John Rockwell wrote that &quot;Horses&quot; is &quot;wonderful in large measure because it recognizes the overwhelming importance of words&quot; in Smith&#x27;s work, covering a range of themes &quot;far beyond what most rock records even dream of.&quot; Rockwell highlighted Smith&#x27;s adaptations of &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot; as the most striking moments on the record, finding that she had rendered the songs &quot;far more expansive than their original creators could have dreamed.&quot; In &quot;Creem&quot;, Lester Bangs wrote that Smith&#x27;s music &quot;in its ultimate moments touches deep wellsprings of emotion that extremely few artists in rock or anywhere else are capable of reaching&quot;, and declared that with &quot;her wealth of promise and the most incandescent flights and stillnesses of this album she joins the ranks of people like Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, or the Dylan of &#x27;Sad Eyed Lady&#x27; and Royal Albert Hall.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau said that while the album does not capture Smith&#x27;s humor, it &quot;gets the minimalist fury of her band and the revolutionary dimension of her singing just fine.&quot;

In the British music press, &quot;Horses&quot; had some detractors. &quot;Street Life&quot; reviewer Angus MacKinnon found that the album&#x27;s minimalist sound merely reflected Smith and her band&#x27;s musical incompetence. Steve Lake derided the album in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as an embodiment of &quot;precisely what&#x27;s wrong with rock and roll right now&quot;, panning it as &quot;completely contrived &#x27;amateurism&#x27;&quot; with a &quot;&#x27;so bad it&#x27;s good&#x27; aesthetic&quot;. Conversely, Jonh Ingham of &quot;Sounds&quot; penned a five-star review of &quot;Horses&quot;, naming it &quot;the record of the year&quot; and &quot;one of the most stunning, commanding, engrossing platters to come down the turnpike since John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; critic Charles Shaar Murray called it &quot;an album in a thousand&quot; and &quot;an important album in terms of what rock can encompass without losing its identity as a musical form, in that it introduces an artist of greater vision than has been seen in rock for far too long.&quot; English television host and future Factory Records co-founder Tony Wilson was so enthused by the record that he made repeated attempts to book Smith and her band for an appearance on his Granada Television program &quot;So It Goes&quot;.

At the end of 1975, &quot;Horses&quot; was voted the second-best album of the year, behind Bob Dylan and the Band&#x27;s &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;, in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; placed &quot;Horses&quot; at number 13 on its year-end list of 1975&#x27;s best albums. According to writer Philip Shaw in his 33⅓ book profiling the album, the enthusiastic reaction to &quot;Horses&quot; from the music press quickly assuaged observers&#x27; suspicions that Smith had sold out by signing to a major label. The album&#x27;s sales were aided by the positive critical reception, along with substantial promotional efforts by Arista.

==Legacy and influence==
&quot;Horses&quot; cemented Smith&#x27;s reputation as a central figure of the New York City punk rock scene. It has frequently been cited as the first punk rock album, as well as one of the key recordings of the punk movement, appearing in professional lists of the best punk albums of all time. &quot;Pipping the Ramones&#x27; first album to the post by five months,&quot; Simon Reynolds wrote in &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;&quot;Horses&quot; is generally considered not just one of the most startling debuts in rock history but the spark that ignited the punk explosion.&quot; &quot;Horses&quot; has been described as a landmark for both punk and its offshoot genre new wave, inspiring &quot;a raw, almost amateurish energy for the former and critical, engaging reflexivity for the latter&quot;, according to Chris Smith in his book &quot;101 Albums That Changed Popular Music&quot; (2009). Philip Shaw stated that the album &quot;created the template&quot; for subsequent rock music of an &quot;intelligent and self-conscious, yet visceral and exciting&quot; sensibility, identifying its influence on the alternative rock, indie rock, and grunge movements that followed the punk era. &quot;Variety&quot; critic David Sprague further noted that &quot;&quot;Horses&quot;—which became the first major-label punk-rock album when Arista unleashed it in 1975—not only helped spread the gospel of Bowery art-punk around the world, it set the tone for smart, unbending female rockers of generations to come.&quot; &quot;&quot;Horses&quot; was hard to enjoy, but I think that was the point. Having been squired by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, whose &#x27;60s-centric sensibility was much of what Smith took aim at, I probably had a similar initial reaction... that critics swaddled in the Beatles and Stones did&quot;, reflected NPR&#x27;s Charlie Kaplan, who over time came to view it as &quot;a great work, even despite its weaknesses... I still feel the chill of Patti Smith&#x27;s suspicious gaze when I look at the cover of &quot;Horses&quot;, but now I feel like I can explain it a little better.&quot;

Various musicians have credited &quot;Horses&quot; as an influence. Viv Albertine of the Slits said that the album &quot;absolutely and completely changed&quot; her life, adding: &quot;Us girls never stood in front of a mirror posing as if we had a guitar because we had no role models. So, when Patti Smith came along, it was huge. She was groundbreakingly different.&quot; Siouxsie and the Banshees frontwoman Siouxsie Sioux, naming &quot;Land&quot; as a recording she considered particularly influential on her, remarked that &quot;apart from Nico, Patti was the first real female writer in rock.&quot; R.E.M.&#x27;s Michael Stipe bought a copy of &quot;Horses&quot; as a high school student and later stated that the album &quot;tore [his] limbs off and put them back on in a whole different order&quot;, citing Smith as his primary inspiration for becoming a musician. Similarly, his R.E.M. bandmate Peter Buck cited attending the four Atlanta shows Smith played on her first US tour as the moment he started to seriously consider forming a group. Morrissey and Johnny Marr shared an appreciation for the record, and one of their early compositions for the Smiths, &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot;, uses a melody based on that of &quot;Kimberly&quot;. Courtney Love of Hole recounted that listening to &quot;Horses&quot; as a teenager helped encourage her to pursue a career in rock music, while PJ Harvey recalled hearing the album and finding it &quot;brilliant—not so much her music but her delivery, words, and her articulation. Her honesty.&quot; KT Tunstall wrote her hit single &quot;Suddenly I See&quot; (2004) about how she felt inspired to embrace her musical ambitions after seeing Smith on the cover of &quot;Horses&quot;.

&quot;Horses&quot; has often been named by music critics as one of the all-time greatest albums. Lars Brandle of &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that the album had come to be regarded as &quot;one of the finest in recorded music history.&quot; In 2003 and 2012, &quot;Horses&quot; was ranked at number 44 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, later placing at number 26 on a 2020 updated list. &quot;NME&quot; named it the 12th-greatest album of all time in a similar list published in 2013. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;Horses&quot; as one of the &quot;All-&quot;Time&quot; 100 Albums&quot;, and &quot;The Observer&quot; listed it as one of 50 albums that changed music history. Three years later, the album was preserved by the Library of Congress into the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. &quot;Horses&quot; was also inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2021.

For the 30th anniversary of &quot;Horses&quot;, the full album was performed live by Smith on June 25, 2005 at the Royal Festival Hall, during the Meltdown festival, which Smith curated. She was backed by original band members Lenny Kaye and Jay Dee Daugherty, as well as Tony Shanahan on bass guitar and piano, Tom Verlaine on guitar, and Flea on bass guitar and trumpet. In 2015, Smith performed &quot;Horses&quot; in its entirety at a series of concerts celebrating its 40th anniversary. The 30th-anniversary performance was released on November 8, 2005 as the second disc of a double CD titled &quot;Horses/Horses&quot;, with the digitally remastered version of the original 1975 album, along with the bonus track &quot;My Generation&quot;, on the first disc. For the release, the live set was recorded by Emery Dobyns and mixed by Dobyns and Shanahan. The original album has also been reissued in remastered form several other times, including on June 18, 1996 (both as a standalone CD and as part of the CD box set &quot;The Patti Smith Masters&quot;), and on April 21, 2012, on LP for that year&#x27;s Record Store Day celebration.

<text>Panama, officially the Republic of Panama, is a country in Latin America at the southern end of Central America, bordering South America. It is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Its capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half of the country&#x27;s over million inhabitants.

Before the arrival of Spanish colonists in the 16th century, Panama was inhabited by a number of different indigenous tribes. It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia, a union of Nueva Granada, Ecuador, and Venezuela. After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831, Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia. With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. The 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties agreed to transfer the canal from the United States to Panama on December 31, 1999. The surrounding territory was returned first, in 1979.

Revenue from canal tolls has continued to represent a significant portion of Panama&#x27;s GDP, especially after the Panama Canal expansion project (finished in 2016) doubled its capacity. Commerce, banking, and tourism are major sectors. Panama is regarded as having a high-income economy. In 2019, Panama ranked 57th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index. In 2018, Panama was ranked the seventh-most competitive economy in Latin America, according to the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Competitiveness Index. Panama was ranked 82nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024. Covering around 40 percent of its land area, Panama&#x27;s jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals – some of them found nowhere else on earth.

Panama is a founding member of the United Nations and other international organizations such as the Organization of American States, Latin America Integration Association, Group of 77, World Health Organization, and Non-Aligned Movement.

==Etymology==
The definite origin of the name &quot;Panama&quot; is unknown. There are several theories. One states that the country was named after a commonly found species of tree (&quot;Sterculia apetala&quot;, the Panama tree). Another states that the first settlers arrived in Panama in August, when butterflies are abundant, and that the name means &quot;many butterflies&quot; in one or several of the indigenous American Indian languages that were spoken in the territory prior to the Spanish colonization. Another theory states that the word is a Castilianization of the Kuna language word &quot;bannaba&quot; which means &quot;distant&quot; or &quot;far away&quot;.

A commonly relayed legend in Panama is that there was a fishing village that bore the name &quot;Panamá&quot;, which purportedly meant &quot;an abundance of fish&quot;, when the Spanish colonists first landed in the area. The exact location of the village is unknown. The legend is usually corroborated by Captain Antonio Tello de Guzmán&#x27;s diary entries, who reports landing at an unnamed village while exploring the Pacific coast of Panama in 1515; he only describes the village as a &quot;small indigenous fishing town&quot;. In 1517, Don Gaspar de Espinosa, a Spanish lieutenant, decided to build a trading post in the same location Guzmán described. In 1519, Pedro Arias Dávila decided to establish the Spanish Empire&#x27;s Pacific port at the site. The new settlement replaced Santa María la Antigua del Darién, which had lost its function within the Crown&#x27;s global plan after the Spanish exploitation of the riches in the Pacific began.

The official definition and origin of the name as promoted by Panama&#x27;s Ministry of Education is the &quot;abundance of fish, trees and butterflies&quot;. This is the usual description given in social studies textbooks.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian period===

The Isthmus of Panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between North and South America finally became complete, and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions. The existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people, agriculture and technology throughout the American continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities.

The earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in Panama include Paleo-Indian projectile points. Later central Panama was home to some of the first pottery-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at Monagrillo, which date back to 2500–1700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500–900 AD) at the Monagrillo archaeological site, and their Gran Coclé style polychrome pottery. The monumental monolithic sculptures at the Barriles (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures.

Before Europeans arrived Panama was widely settled by Chibchan, Chocoan, and Cueva peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed by regular regional routes of commerce. Austronesians had a trade network to Panama as there is evidence of coconuts reaching the Pacific coast of Panama from the Philippines in Precolumbian times.

When Panama was colonized, the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands. Scholars believe that infectious disease was the primary cause of the population decline of American natives. The indigenous peoples had no acquired immunity to diseases such as smallpox which had been chronic in Eurasian populations for centuries.

===Conquest to 1799===
Rodrigo de Bastidas sailed westward from Venezuela in 1501 in search of gold, and became the first European to explore the isthmus of Panama. A year later, Christopher Columbus visited the isthmus, and established a short-lived settlement in the province of Darien. Vasco Núñez de Balboa&#x27;s tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas, and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain&#x27;s empire in the New World. King Ferdinand II assigned Pedro Arias Dávila as Royal Governor. He arrived in June 1514 with 19 vessels and 1,500 men. In 1519, Dávila founded Panama City. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for Spain. The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of Crosses) because of the number of gravesites along the way. At 1520 the Genoese controlled the port of Panama. The Genoese obtained a concession from the Spanish to exploit the port of Panama mainly for the slave trade, until the destruction of the primeval city in 1671. In the meantime in 1635 Don Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera, the then governor of Panama, had recruited Genoese, Peruvians, and Panamanians, as soldiers to wage war against Muslims in the Philippines and to found the city of Zamboanga.

Panama was under Spanish rule for almost 300 years (1538–1821), and became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of &quot;geographic destiny&quot;, and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned Panamanian nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.

In 1538, the Real Audiencia of Panama was established, initially with jurisdiction from Nicaragua to Cape Horn, until the conquest of Peru. A Real Audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court. Each audiencia had an &quot;oidor&quot; (Spanish: hearer, a judge).

Spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of Panama. Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as &quot;indios de guerra&quot; (war Indians). However, Panama was important to Spain strategically because it was the easiest way to ship silver mined in Peru to Europe. Silver cargoes were landed on the west coast of Panama and then taken overland to Portobello or Nombre de Dios on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment. Aside from the European route, there was also an Asian-American route, which led to traders and adventurers carrying silver from Peru going over land through Panama to reach Acapulco, Mexico before sailing to Manila, Philippines using the famed Manila galleons. In 1579, the royal monopoly that Acapulco, Mexico had on trading with Manila, Philippines was relaxed and Panama was assigned as another port that was able to trade directly with Asia.

Because of incomplete Spanish control, the Panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly Dutch and English), and from &quot;new world&quot; Africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or &quot;palenques&quot; around the Camino Real in Panama&#x27;s Interior, and on some of the islands off Panama&#x27;s Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under Bayano, which emerged in the 1552 to 1558 period. Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s famous raids on Panama in 1572–73 and John Oxenham&#x27;s crossing to the Pacific Ocean were aided by Panama cimarrons, and Spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.

The following elements helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within Panama well before the rest of the colonies: the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540–1740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the Spanish Empire – the first modern global empire.

The end of the encomienda system in Azuero, however, sparked the conquest of Veraguas in that same year. Under the leadership of Francisco Vázquez, the region of Veraguas passed into Castilian rule in 1558. In the newly conquered region, the old system of encomienda was imposed. On the other hand, the Panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the Azuero Peninsula, set forth by the Spanish Crown, in 1558 because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population. In its stead, a system of medium and smaller-sized landownership was promoted, thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and small-sized proprietors.

Panama was the site of the ill-fated Darien scheme, which set up a Scottish colony in the region in 1698. This failed for a number of reasons, and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of England and Scotland in 1707.

In 1671, the privateer Henry Morgan, licensed by the English government, sacked and burned the city of Panama – the second most important city in the Spanish New World at the time. In 1717 the viceroyalty of New Granada (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take Spanish territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of Panama was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada&#x27;s capital, Santa Fe de Bogotá (the modern capital of Colombia) proved a greater obstacle than the Spanish crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the viceroyalty of Peru and even by Panama&#x27;s own initiative. This uneasy relationship between Panama and Bogotá would persist for centuries.

In 1744, Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the College of San Ignacio de Loyola and on June 3, 1749, founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier. By this time, however, Panama&#x27;s importance and influence had become insignificant as Spain&#x27;s power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted ships to round Cape Horn in order to reach the Pacific. While the Panama route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other.

====1800s====
As the Spanish American wars of independence were heating up all across Latin America, Panama City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of Saints), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of Azuero without backing from Panama City to declare their separation from the Spanish Empire. In both Veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans.

Nevertheless, the Grito was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in Panama City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from Spain, but also for their right to self-rule apart from Panama City once the Spaniards were gone.

It was seen as a risky move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel José Pedro Antonio de Fábrega y de las Cuevas (1774–1841). The colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus&#x27; military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists.

What they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, Juan de la Cruz Murgeón, left the isthmus on a campaign in Quito and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting Fábrega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, Fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, Fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city&#x27;s support for independence. No military repercussions occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troops.

===Post-colonial Panama===

In the 80 years following independence from Spain, Panama was a subdivision of Gran Colombia, after voluntarily joining the country at the end of 1821. It then became part of the Republic of New Granada in 1831 and was divided into several provinces. In 1855, the autonomous State of Panama was created within the Republic out of the New Granada provinces of Panama, Azuero, Chiriquí, and Veraguas. It continued as a state in the Granadine Confederation (1858–1863) and United States of Colombia (1863–1886). The 1886 constitution of the modern Republic of Colombia created a new Panama Department.

The people of the isthmus made over 80 attempts to secede from Colombia. They came close to success in 1831, then again during the Thousand Days&#x27; War of 1899–1902, understood among indigenous Panamanians as a struggle for land rights under the leadership of Victoriano Lorenzo.

The US intent to influence the area, especially the Panama Canal&#x27;s construction and control, led to the secession of Panama from Colombia in 1903 and its political independence. When the Senate of Colombia rejected the Hay–Herrán Treaty on January 22, 1903, the United States decided to support and encourage the Panamanian secessionist movement.

In November 1903, Panama, tacitly supported by the United States, proclaimed its independence and concluded the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty with the United States without the presence of a single Panamanian. Philippe Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer and lobbyist represented Panama even though Panama&#x27;s president and a delegation had arrived in New York to negotiate the treaty. Bunau-Varilla was a shareholder in a French company (the &quot;Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama&quot;), which had acquired the rights of the original French company which had gone bankrupt in 1889. The treaty was quickly drafted and signed the night before the Panamanian delegation arrived in Washington. The treaty granted rights to the United States &quot;as if it were sovereign&quot; in a zone roughly wide and long. In that zone, the US would build a canal, then administer, fortify, and defend it &quot;in perpetuity&quot;.

In 1914, the United States completed the existing canal.

Because of the strategic importance of the canal during World War II, the US extensively fortified access to it.

From 1903 to 1968, Panama was a constitutional democracy dominated by a commercially oriented oligarchy. During the 1950s, the Panamanian military began to challenge the oligarchy&#x27;s political hegemony. The early 1960s saw also the beginning of sustained pressure in Panama for the renegotiation of the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, including riots that broke out in early 1964, resulting in widespread looting and dozens of deaths, and the evacuation of the American embassy.

Amid negotiations for the Robles–Johnson treaty, Panama held elections in 1968. The candidates were:
* Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid, Unión Nacional (National Union)
* Antonio González Revilla, Democracia Cristiana (Christian Democrats)
* Engr. David Samudio, Alianza del Pueblo (People&#x27;s Alliance), who had the government&#x27;s support.

Arias Madrid was declared the winner of elections that were marked by violence and accusations of fraud against Alianza del Pueblo. On October 1, 1968, Arias Madrid took office as president of Panama, promising to lead a government of &quot;national union&quot; that would end the reigning corruption and pave the way for a new Panama. A week and a half later, on October 11, 1968, the National Guard (Guardia Nacional) ousted Arias and initiated the downward spiral that would culminate with the United States&#x27; invasion in 1989. Arias, who had promised to respect the hierarchy of the National Guard, broke the pact and started a large restructuring of the Guard. To preserve the Guard&#x27;s and his vested interests, Lieutenant Colonel Omar Torrijos Herrera and Major Boris Martínez commanded another military coup against the government.

The military justified itself by declaring that Arias Madrid was trying to install a dictatorship, and promised a return to constitutional rule. In the meantime, the Guard began a series of populist measures that would gain support for the coup. Among them were:
* Price freezing on food, medicine and other goods until January 31, 1969
* rent level freeze
* legalization of the permanence of squatting families in boroughs surrounding the historic site of Panama Viejo
Parallel to this, the military began a policy of repression against the opposition, who were labeled communists. The military appointed a Provisional Government Junta that was to arrange new elections. However, the National Guard would prove to be very reluctant to abandon power and soon began calling itself &quot;El Gobierno Revolucionario&quot; (The Revolutionary Government).

====Post-1970====
Under Omar Torrijos&#x27;s control, the military transformed the political and economic structure of the country, initiating massive coverage of social security services and expanding public education.

The constitution was changed in 1972. To reform the constitution, the military created a new organization, the Assembly of Corregimiento Representatives, which replaced the National Assembly. The new assembly, also known as the Poder Popular (Power of the People), was composed of 505 members selected by the military with no participation from political parties, which the military had eliminated. The new constitution proclaimed Omar Torrijos as the Maximum Leader of the Panamanian Revolution, and conceded him unlimited power for six years, although, to keep a façade of constitutionality, Demetrio B. Lakas was appointed president for the same period.

In 1981, Torrijos died in a plane crash. Torrijos&#x27; death altered the tone of Panama&#x27;s political evolution. Despite the 1983 constitutional amendments which proscribed a political role for the military, the Panama Defense Force (PDF), as they were then known, continued to dominate Panamanian political life. By this time, General Manuel Antonio Noriega was firmly in control of both the PDF and the civilian government.
In the 1984 elections, the candidates were:
* Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino, supported by the military in a union called UNADE
* Arnulfo Arias Madrid, for the opposition union ADO
* ex-General Rubén Darío Paredes, who had been forced to an early retirement by Manuel Noriega, running for the Partido Nacionalista Popular (PAP; &quot;Popular Nationalist Party&quot;)
* Carlos Iván Zúñiga, running for the Partido Acción Popular (PAPO; Popular Action Party)
Barletta was declared the winner of elections that had been considered to be fraudulent. Barletta inherited a country in economic ruin and hugely indebted to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Amid the economic crisis and Barletta&#x27;s efforts to calm the country&#x27;s creditors, street protests arose, and so did military repression.

Meanwhile, Noriega&#x27;s regime had fostered a well-hidden criminal economy that operated as a parallel source of income for the military and their allies, providing revenues from drugs and money laundering. Toward the end of the military dictatorship, a new wave of Chinese migrants arrived on the isthmus in the hope of migrating to the United States. The smuggling of Chinese became an enormous business, with revenues of up to 200 million dollars for Noriega&#x27;s regime (see Mon 167).

The military dictatorship assassinated or tortured more than one hundred Panamanians and forced at least a hundred more dissidents into exile. (see Zárate 15). Noriega&#x27;s regime was supported by the United States and it began playing a double role in Central America. While the Contadora group, an initiative launched by the foreign ministers of various Latin American nations including Panama&#x27;s, conducted diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region, Noriega supplied Nicaraguan Contras and other guerrillas in the region with weapons and ammunition on behalf of the CIA.

On June 6, 1987, the recently retired Colonel Roberto Díaz Herrera, resentful that Noriega had broken the agreed-upon &quot;Torrijos Plan&quot; of succession that would have made him the chief of the military after Noriega, decided to denounce the regime. He revealed details of electoral fraud, accused Noriega of planning Torrijos&#x27;s death and declared that Torrijos had received 12 million dollars from the Shah of Iran for giving the exiled Iranian leader asylum. He also accused Noriega of the assassination by decapitation of then-opposition leader, Dr. Hugo Spadafora.

On the night of June 9, 1987, the Cruzada Civilista (&quot;Civic Crusade&quot;) was created and began organizing actions of civil disobedience. The Crusade called for a general strike. In response, the military suspended constitutional rights and declared a state of emergency in the country. On July 10, the Civic Crusade called for a massive demonstration that was violently repressed by the &quot;Dobermans&quot;, the military&#x27;s special riot control unit. That day, later known as El Viernes Negro (&quot;Black Friday&quot;), left many people injured and killed.

United States President Ronald Reagan began a series of sanctions against the military regime. The United States froze economic and military assistance to Panama in the middle of 1987 in response to the domestic political crisis in Panama and an attack on the US embassy. The sanctions failed to oust Noriega, but severely hurt Panama&#x27;s economy. Panama&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) declined almost 25 percent between 1987 and 1989.

On February 5, 1988, General Manuel Antonio Noriega was accused of drug trafficking by federal juries in Tampa and Miami. Human Rights Watch wrote in its 1989 report: &quot;Washington turned a blind eye to abuses in Panama for many years until concern over drug trafficking prompted indictments of the general [Noriega] by two grand juries in Florida in February 1988&quot;.

In April 1988, US President Ronald Reagan invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, freezing Panamanian government assets in all US organizations. In May 1989 Panamanians voted overwhelmingly for the anti-Noriega candidates. The Noriega regime promptly annulled the election and embarked on a new round of repression.

====US invasion (1989)====
The United States invaded Panama on December 20, 1989, codenamed Operation Just Cause. The U.S. stated the operation was &quot;necessary to safeguard the lives of U.S. citizens in Panama, defend democracy and human rights, combat drug trafficking, and secure the neutrality of the Panama Canal as required by the Torrijos–Carter Treaties&quot;. The US reported 23 servicemen killed and 324 wounded, with the number of Panamanian soldiers killed estimated at 450. The estimates for civilians killed in the conflict ranges from 200 to 4,000. The United Nations put the Panamanian civilian death toll at 500, Americas Watch estimated 300, the United States gave a figure of 202 civilians killed and former US attorney general Ramsey Clark estimated 4,000 deaths. It represented the largest United States military operation since the Vietnam War. The number of US civilians (and their dependents), who had worked for the Panama Canal Commission and the US military, and were killed by the Panamanian Defense Forces, has never been fully disclosed.

On December 29, the United Nations General Assembly approved a resolution calling the intervention in Panama a &quot;flagrant violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States&quot;. A similar resolution was vetoed in the Security Council by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Noriega was captured and flown to Miami to be tried. The conflict ended on January 31, 1990.

The urban population, many living below the poverty level, was greatly affected by the 1989 intervention. As pointed out in 1995 by a UN Technical Assistance Mission to Panama, the fighting displaced 20,000 people. The most heavily affected district was the El Chorrillo area of Panama City, where several blocks of apartments were completely destroyed. The economic damage caused by the fighting has been estimated at between 1.5 and 2 billion dollars. Most Panamanians supported the intervention.

===Post-intervention era===
Panama&#x27;s Electoral Tribunal moved quickly to restore civilian constitutional government, reinstated the results of the May 1989 election on December 27, 1989, and confirmed the victory of President Guillermo Endara and Vice Presidents Guillermo Ford and Ricardo Arias Calderón.

During its five-year term, the often-fractious government struggled to meet the public&#x27;s high expectations. Its new police force was a major improvement over its predecessor but was not fully able to deter crime. Ernesto Pérez Balladares was sworn in as president on September 1, 1994, after an internationally monitored election campaign.

On September 1, 1999, Mireya Moscoso, the widow of former President Arnulfo Arias Madrid, took office after defeating PRD candidate Martín Torrijos, son of Omar Torrijos, in a free and fair election. During her administration, Moscoso attempted to strengthen social programs, especially for child and youth development, protection, and general welfare. Moscoso&#x27;s administration successfully handled the Panama Canal transfer and was effective in the administration of the Canal.

The PRD&#x27;s Martin Torrijos won the presidency and a legislative majority in the National Assembly in 2004. Torrijos ran his campaign on a platform of, among other pledges, a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; for corruption, a problem endemic to the Moscoso and Perez Balladares administrations. After taking office, Torrijos passed a number of laws which made the government more transparent. He formed a National Anti-Corruption Council whose members represented the highest levels of government and civil society, labor organizations, and religious leadership. In addition, many of his closest Cabinet ministers were non-political technocrats known for their support for the Torrijos government&#x27;s anti-corruption aims. Despite the Torrijos administration&#x27;s public stance on corruption, many high-profile cases, particularly involving political or business elites, were never acted upon.

Conservative supermarket magnate Ricardo Martinelli was elected to succeed Martin Torrijos with a landslide victory in the May 2009 Panamanian general election. Martinelli&#x27;s business credentials drew voters worried by slowing growth during the Great Recession. Standing for the four-party opposition Alliance for Change, Martinelli gained 60 percent of the vote, against 37 percent for the candidate of the governing left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD).

On May 4, 2014, Vice President Juan Carlos Varela, candidate of the Partido Panamenista (Panamanian Party) won the 2014 presidential election with over 39 percent of the votes, against the party of his former political partner Ricardo Martinelli, Cambio Democrático, and their candidate José Domingo Arias. He was sworn in on July 1, 2014. On July 1, 2019 Laurentino Cortizo took possession of the presidency. Cortizo was the candidate of Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) in the May 2019 presidential election.

During the presidency of Cortizo, numerous events happened in the country, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, and the 2022 and 2023 protests.

On July 1, 2024, José Raúl Mulino was sworn in as Panama&#x27;s new president. Mulino, a close ally of former President Ricardo Martinelli, won the presidential election in May 2024.

==Geography==


Panama is located in Central America, bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, between Colombia and Costa Rica. It mostly lies between latitudes 7° and 10°N, and longitudes 77° and 83°W (a small area lies west of 83°).

Its location on the Isthmus of Panama is strategic. By 2000, Panama controlled the Panama Canal which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea to the north of the Pacific Ocean. Panama&#x27;s total area is .

The dominant feature of Panama&#x27;s geography is the central spine of mountains and hills that form the continental divide. The divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of North America, and only near the Colombian border are there highlands related to the Andean system of South America. The spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom, in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions.

The mountain range of the divide is called the Cordillera de Talamanca near the Costa Rican border. Farther east it becomes the Serranía de Tabasará, and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus, where the Panama Canal is located, is often called the Sierra de Veraguas. As a whole, the range between Costa Rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographers as the Cordillera Central.

The highest point in the country is the Volcán Barú, which rises to . A nearly impenetrable jungle forms the Darién Gap between Panama and Colombia where Colombian guerrillas and drug dealers operate and sometimes take hostages. This, as well as unrest and forest protection movements, creates the only break in the Pan-American Highway, which otherwise forms a complete road from Alaska to Patagonia.

Panama&#x27;s wildlife is the most diverse in Central America. It is home to many South American species as well as to North American wildlife.

===Waterways===
Nearly 500 rivers lace Panama&#x27;s rugged landscape. Mostly unnavigable, many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the Río Chagres (&quot;Chagres River&quot;), located in central Panama, is one of the few wide rivers and a source of hydroelectric power. The central part of the river is dammed by the Gatun Dam and forms Gatun Lake, an artificial lake that constitutes part of the Panama Canal. The lake was created by the construction of the Gatun Dam across the Río Chagres between 1907 and 1913. Once created, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world, and the dam was the largest earth dam. The river drains northwest into the Caribbean. The Kampia and Madden Lakes (also filled from the Río Chagres) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former Canal Zone.

The Río Chepo, another source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific. These Pacific-oriented rivers are longer and slower-running than those on the Caribbean side. Their basins are also more extensive. One of the longest is the Río Tuira, which flows into the Golfo de San Miguel and is the nation&#x27;s only river that is navigable by larger vessels.

===Harbors===
The Caribbean coastline is marked by several natural harbors. However, Cristóbal, at the Caribbean terminus of the canal, had the only important port facilities in the late 1980s. The numerous islands of the Archipiélago de Bocas del Toro, near the Beaches of Costa Rica, provide an extensive natural roadstead and shield the banana port of Almirante. The more than 350 San Blas Islands near Colombia, are strung out over more than along the sheltered Caribbean coastline.
The terminal ports located at each end of the Panama Canal, namely the Port of Cristóbal, Colón, and the Port of Balboa, are ranked second and third respectively in Latin America in terms of the number of container units (TEU) handled. The Port of Balboa covers 182 hectares and contains four berths for containers and two multi-purpose berths. In total, the berths are over long with alongside depth of . The Port of Balboa has 18 super post-Panamax and Panamax quay cranes and 44 gantry cranes. The Port of Balboa also contains of warehouse space.

The Ports of Cristobal (encompassing the container terminals of Panama Ports Cristobal, Manzanillo International Terminal, and Colon Container Terminal) handled 2,210,720 TEU in 2009, second only to the Port of Santos, Brazil, in Latin America.

Excellent deep water ports capable of accommodating large VLCC (Very Large Crude Oil Carriers) are located at Charco Azul, Chiriquí (Pacific), and Chiriquí Grande, Bocas del Toro (Atlantic) near Panama&#x27;s western border with Costa Rica. The Trans-Panama pipeline, running across the isthmus, has operated between Charco Azul and Chiriquí Grande since 1979.

===Climate===

Panama has a tropical climate. Temperatures are uniformly high—as is the relative humidity—and there is little seasonal variation. Diurnal ranges are low; on a typical dry-season day in the capital city, the early morning minimum may be and the afternoon maximum . The temperature seldom exceeds for more than a short time. Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean, and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country. Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges, and frosts occur in the Cordillera de Talamanca in western Panama.

Climatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on rainfall, which varies regionally from less than to more than per year. Almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season, which is usually from April to December, but varies in length from seven to nine months. In general, rainfall is much heavier on the Caribbean than on the Pacific side of the continental divide, due in part to occasional tropical cyclone activity nearby; Panama lies outside the Main Development Region. The annual average in Panama City is little more than half of that in Colón.

Panama is one of three countries in the world to be carbon-negative, meaning that it absorbs more carbon dioxide than it releases into the atmosphere. The others are Bhutan and Suriname.

===Biodiversity===
Panama&#x27;s tropical environment supports an abundance of plants. Forests dominate, interrupted in places by grasslands, scrub, and crops. Although nearly 40% of Panama is still wooded, deforestation is a continuing threat to the rain-drenched woodlands. Tree cover has been reduced by more than 50 percent since the 1940s. Subsistence farming, widely practiced from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands, consists largely of corn, bean, and tuber plots. Mangrove swamps occur along parts of both coasts, with banana plantations occupying deltas near Costa Rica. In many places, a multi-canopied rainforest abuts the swamp on one side of the country and extends to the lower reaches of slopes on the other. Panama had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.37/10, ranking it 78th globally out of 172 countries.

Soberanía National Park has the greatest diversity of birds for birdwatching, with more than 525 birds inhabiting the area. It also has a variety of mammals such as capybaras and coyotes, reptiles like the green iguana, and amphibians such as the cane toad.

In May 2022, in order to increase the supply of lower-carbon aviation fuel, the government of Panama and energy companies announced its plan to develop a major and advanced biorefinery of aviation fuel in the country.

==Politics==

Panama&#x27;s politics take place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Panama is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.

National elections are universal for all citizens 18 years and older. National elections for the executive and legislative branches take place every five years. Members of the judicial branch (justices) are appointed by the head of state. Panama&#x27;s National Assembly is elected by proportional representation in fixed electoral districts, so many smaller parties are represented. Presidential elections require a plurality; out of the five last presidents only ex-president Ricardo Martinelli has managed to be elected with over 50 percent of the popular vote.

===Political culture===

Since the end of Manuel Noriega&#x27;s military dictatorship in 1989, Panama has completed five peaceful transfers of power to opposing political factions. The political landscape is dominated by two major parties and various smaller parties, many of which are driven by individual leaders more than ideologies. Former President Martín Torrijos is the son of the general Omar Torrijos. He succeeded Mireya Moscoso, the widow of the former president Arnulfo Arias. Panama&#x27;s most recent national elections took place on May 5, 2024.

===Foreign relations===

The United States cooperates with the Panamanian government in promoting economic, political, security, and social development through US and international agencies. Cultural ties between the two countries are strong, and many Panamanians go to the United States for higher education and advanced training.

Panama is the 96th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 Global Peace Index.

===Military===
Shortly after its independence from Colombia in 1903, Panama abolished its army. It maintained police operations throughout the nation. During the 1940s, the Chief of Police of Panama City, José Remón, exercised pronounced political power in Panama. He removed and appointed several presidents. In 1952 he ran for president. The campaign was marred by police brutality and persecution of the opposition. In an election questioned by independent observers, Remón was declared the president. Less than three years later Remón was assassinated. He was the only president to be assassinated in Panamanian history. Today the Panamanian Public Forces are the national security forces of Panama. Panama is the second country in Latin America (the other being Costa Rica) to permanently abolish its standing army. Panama maintains armed police and security forces, and small air and maritime forces. They are tasked with law enforcement and can perform limited military actions.

In 2017, Panama signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

===Administrative divisions===







Panama is divided into ten provinces with their respective local authorities (governors). Each is divided into districts and &quot;corregimientos&quot; (townships). Also, there are six &quot;Comarcas&quot; (literally: &quot;Shires&quot;) populated by a variety of indigenous groups.

Provinces

Comarcas
==Economy==

According to the CIA World Factbook, Panama had an unemployment rate of 2.7 percent. A food surplus was registered in August 2008. On the Human Development Index, Panama ranked 60th in 2015. In more recent years, Panama&#x27;s economy has experienced a boom, with growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) averaging over 10.4 percent in 2006–2008. Panama&#x27;s economy was among the fastest growing and best managed in Latin America. The Latin Business Chronicle predicted that Panama would be the fastest growing economy in Latin America during the five-year period from 2010 to 2014, matching Brazil&#x27;s 10 percent rate.

The expansion project on the Panama Canal is expected to boost and extend economic expansion for some time. Panama also signed the Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement which eliminates tariffs to US services.

Even though Panama is regarded as a high-income country, it still remains a country of stark contrasts perpetuated by dramatic educational disparities. Between 2015 and 2017, poverty at less than US$5.5 a day fell from 15.4 to an estimated 14.1 percent.

===Economic sectors===
Panama&#x27;s economy, because of its key geographic location, is mainly based on a well-developed service sector, especially commerce, tourism, and trading. The handover of the Canal and military installations by the United States has given rise to large construction projects.

A project to build a third set of locks for the Panama Canal was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum (with low voter turnout, however) on October 22, 2006. The official estimated cost of the project is US$5.25 billion, but the canal is of major economic importance because it provides millions of dollars of toll revenue to the national economy and provides massive employment. Transfer of control of the Canal to the Panamanian government completed in 1999, after 85 years of US control.

Copper and gold deposits are being developed by foreign investors, to the dismay of some environmental groups, as all of the projects are located within protected areas.

===Panama as an IFC===

Since the early 20th century, Panama has with the revenues from the canal built the largest Regional Financial Center (IFC) in Central America, with consolidated assets being more than three times that of Panama&#x27;s GDP. The banking sector employs more than 24,000 people directly. Financial intermediation contributed 9.3 percent of GDP. Stability has been a key strength of Panama&#x27;s financial sector, which has benefited from the country&#x27;s favorable economic and business climate. Banking institutions report sound growth and solid financial earnings. The banking supervisory regime is largely compliant with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. As a regional financial center, Panama exports some banking services, mainly to Latin America, and plays an important role in the country&#x27;s economy. However, Panama still cannot compare to the position held by Hong Kong or Singapore as financial centers in Asia.

Panama still has a reputation worldwide for being a tax haven but has agreed to enhanced transparency, especially since the release in 2016 of the Panama Papers. Significant progress has been made to improve full compliance with anti-money laundering recommendations. Panama was removed from the FATF gray list in February 2016. The European Union also removed Panama from its tax haven blacklist in 2018. However efforts remain to be made, and the IMF repeatedly mentions the need to strengthen financial transparency and fiscal structure.

===Transportation===

Panama is home to Tocumen International Airport, Central America&#x27;s largest airport and the hub for Copa Airlines, the flag carrier of Panama. Additionally, there are more than 20 smaller airfields in the country. (See list of airports in Panama).

Panama&#x27;s roads, traffic and transportation systems are generally safe, though night driving is difficult and in some cases, restricted by local authorities. This usually occurs in informal settlements. Traffic in Panama moves on the right, and Panamanian law requires that drivers and passengers wear seat belts. Highways are generally well-developed for a Latin American country. The Pan-American Highway travels from north to south through the country, starting at the border with Costa Rica, but ending short of Colombia at an area called the Darién Gap.

The Panama City area is well served by the nearly 150 bus routes publicly operated MiBus system along with the two rapid transit lines of the Panama Metro. Prior to the government operation of bus routes, Panama was served by privately operated buses called &quot;diablo rojos&quot; (English: red devils), which were typically retired school buses from the United States painted in bright colours by their operators. The &quot;diablo rojos&quot; that remain are now mainly used in rural areas.

===Tourism===


Tourism in Panama has maintained its growth over the past five years due to government tax and price discounts to foreign guests and retirees. These economic incentives have caused Panama to be regarded as a relatively good place to retire. Real estate developers in Panama have increased the number of tourism destinations in the past five years because of interest in these visitor incentives.

The number of tourists from Europe grew by 23.1 percent during the first nine months of 2008. According to the Tourism Authority of Panama (ATP), from January to September, 71,154 tourists from Europe entered Panama, 13,373 more than in same period the previous year. Most of the European tourists were Spaniards (14,820), followed by Italians (13,216), French (10,174) and British (8,833). There were 6997 from Germany, the most populous country in the European Union. Europe has become one of the key markets to promote Panama as a tourist destination.

In 2012, 4.585 billion US dollars entered into the Panamanian economy as a result of tourism. This accounted for 11.34 percent of the gross national product of the country, surpassing other productive sectors. The number of tourists who arrived that year was 2.2 million.

Panama enacted Law No. 80 in 2012 to promote foreign investment in tourism. Law 80 replaced an older Law 8 of 1994. Law 80 provides 100 percent exemption from income tax and real estate taxes for 15 years, duty-free imports for construction materials and equipment for five years, and a capital gains tax exemption for five years.

===Currency===
The Panamanian currency is officially the balboa, fixed at a rate of 1:1 with the United States dollar since Panamanian independence in 1903. In practice, Panama is dollarized: U.S. dollars are legal tender and used for all paper currency, and whilst Panama has its own coinage, U.S. coins are widely used. Because of the tie to US dollars, Panama has traditionally had low inflation. According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Panama&#x27;s inflation in 2006 was 2.0 percent as measured by a weighted Consumer Price Index.

The balboa replaced the Colombian peso in 1904 after Panama&#x27;s independence. Balboa banknotes were printed in 1941 by President Arnulfo Arias. They were recalled several days later, giving them the name &quot;The Seven Day Dollars&quot;. The notes were burned by the new government, but occasionally balboa notes can be found in collections. These were the only banknotes ever issued by Panama and US notes have circulated both before and since.

On April 28, 2022, Panama&#x27;s lawmakers approved a bill that would legalize and regulate the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The bill covers using cryptocurrency, trading it, tokenizing precious metals, and issuing digital securities, among other related topics. Its passing will also allow citizens to use their cryptocurrency holdings to pay taxes. On July 14, 2023, the Supreme Court of Justice declared the bill unenforceable.

===International trade===
The high levels of Panamanian trade are in large part from the Colón Free Trade Zone, the largest free trade zone in the Western Hemisphere. Last year the zone accounted for 92 percent of Panama&#x27;s exports and 64 percent of its imports, according to an analysis of figures from the Colon zone management and estimates of Panama&#x27;s trade by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Panama&#x27;s economy is also very much supported by the trade and export of coffee and other agricultural products.

The Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) between the governments of the United States and Panama was signed on October 27, 1982. The treaty protects US investment and assists Panama in its efforts to develop its economy by creating conditions more favorable for US private investment and thereby strengthening the development of its private sector. The BIT was the first such treaty signed by the US in the Western Hemisphere. A Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) was signed in 2007, approved by Panama on July 11, 2007, and by US President Obama on October 21, 2011, and the agreement entered into force on October 31, 2012.

==Society==

===Demographics===


Panama had an estimated population of in . The proportion of the population aged less than 15 in 2010 was 29 percent. 64.5 percent of the population was between 15 and 65, with 6.6 percent of the population 65 years or older.

More than half the population lives in the Panama City–Colón metropolitan corridor, which spans several cities. Panama&#x27;s urban population exceeds 75 percent, making Panama&#x27;s population the most urbanized in Central America.

===Ethnic groups===
In 2010 the population was 65 percent Mestizo (mixed white, Native American), 12.3 percent Native American, 9.2 percent Black or African descent, 6.8 percent mulatto, and 6.7 percent White.

The Amerindian population includes seven ethnic groups: the Ngäbe, Kuna (Guna), Emberá, Buglé, Wounaan, Naso Tjerdi (Teribe), and Bri Bri.

Most Afro-Panamanians live on the Panama–Colón metropolitan area, the Darién Province, La Palma, and Bocas del Toro Province. Areas in Panama City with significant Afro-Panamian influence Rio Abajo and Casco Viejo. Black Panamanians are descendants of African slaves brought to the Americas in the Atlantic slave trade. The second wave of black people brought to Panama came from the Caribbean during the construction of the Panama Canal.

Panama also has a considerable Chinese and Indian population brought to work on the canal during its construction. Most Chinese Panamanians reside in the province of Chiriquí. Europeans and White Panamanians are a minority in Panama. Panama is also home to a small Arab community that has mosques and practices Islam, as well as a Jewish community and many synagogues.

===Languages===
Spanish is the official and dominant language. The Spanish spoken in Panama is known as Panamanian Spanish. About 93 percent of the population speak Spanish as their first language. Many citizens who hold jobs at international levels, or at business corporations, speak both English and Spanish. About 14 percent of Panamanians speak English; this number is expected to rise because Panama now requires English classes in its public schools. Native languages, such as Ngäbere, are spoken throughout the country, mostly in their native territories. Over 400,000 Panamanians keep their native languages and customs. About 4 percent speak French and 1 percent speak Arabic.

===Largest cities===
These are the 10 largest Panamanian cities and towns. Most of Panama&#x27;s largest cities are part of the Panama City Metropolitan Area.

===Religion===


Christianity is the main religion in Panama. An official survey carried out by the government estimated in 2015 that 63.2% of the population, or 2,549,150 people, identifies itself as Roman Catholic, and 25% as evangelical Protestant, or 1,009,740.

The Baháʼí Faith community in Panama is estimated at 2% of the national population, or about 60,000 including about 10% of the Guaymí population.

The Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were the next largest congregation comprising the 1.4% of the population, followed by the Adventist Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 0.6%. Smaller groups include the Buddhist, Jewish, Episcopalian, Muslim and Hindu communities. Indigenous religions include Ibeorgun (among Kuna) and Mamatata (among Ngäbe). There are also a small number of Rastafarians.

===Education===
During the 16th century, education in Panama was provided by Jesuits. Public education began in Panama soon after it seceded from Colombia in 1903. The first efforts were guided by a paternalistic view of the goals of education, as evidenced in comments made in a 1913 meeting of the First Panamanian Educational Assembly, &quot;The cultural heritage given to the child should be determined by the social position he will or should occupy. For this reason education should be different in accordance with the social class to which the student should be related.&quot; This elitist focus changed rapidly under US influence.

In 2010, it was estimated that 94.1 percent of the population was literate (94.7 percent of males and 93.5 percent of females). Education in Panama is compulsory for all children between ages 6 and 15. In recent decades, school enrollment at all levels, but especially at upper levels, has increased significantly. Panama participates in the PISA exams, but due to debts and unsatisfactory exam results, it postponed participation until 2018.

==Culture==


The culture of Panama derives from European music, art and traditions brought by the Spanish to Panama. Hegemonic forces have created hybrid forms blending African and Native American culture with European culture. For example, the &quot;tamborito&quot; is a Spanish dance with African rhythms, themes and dance moves.

Dance is typical of the diverse cultures in Panama. The local folklore can be experienced at a multitude of festivals, through dances and traditions handed down from generation to generation. Local cities host live &quot;reggae en español&quot;, &quot;reggaeton&quot;, &quot;haitiano (compas)&quot;, jazz, blues, &quot;salsa&quot;, reggae, and rock music performances.

===Handicraft===
Outside Panama City, regional festivals take place throughout the year featuring local musicians and dancers. Panama&#x27;s blended culture is reflected in traditional products, such as woodcarvings, ceremonial masks and pottery, as well as in Panama&#x27;s architecture, cuisine and festivals. In earlier times, baskets were woven for utilitarian uses, but now many villages rely almost exclusively on income from the baskets they produce for tourists.

An example of undisturbed, unique culture in Panama is that of the Guna who are known for &quot;molas&quot;. &quot;Mola&quot; is the Guna word for blouse, but the term &quot;mola&quot; has come to mean the elaborate embroidered panels made by Guna women, that make up the front and back of a Guna woman&#x27;s blouse. They are several layers of cloth, varying in color, that are loosely stitched together, made using a reverse appliqué process.

===Holidays and festivities===
The Christmas parade, known as &quot;El desfile de Navidad&quot;, is celebrated in the capital, Panama City. This holiday is celebrated on December 25. The floats in the parade are decorated in the Panamanian colors, and women wear dresses called &quot;pollera&quot; and men dress in traditional montuno. In addition, the marching band in the parade, consisting of drummers, keeps crowds entertained. In the city, a big Christmas tree is lit with Christmas lights, and everybody surrounds the tree and sings Christmas carols.

===Traditional cuisine===
Since Panama&#x27;s cultural heritage is influenced by many ethnicities the traditional cuisine of the country includes ingredients from many cultures, from all over the world:
a mix of African, Spanish, and Native American techniques, dishes, and ingredients, reflecting its diverse population. Since Panama is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking.
The famous fish market known as the &quot;Mercado de Mariscos&quot; offers fresh seafood and Ceviche, a seafood dish. Small shops along the street which are called kiosco and Empanada, which is a typical latinamerican pastry, including a variety of different ingredients, either with meat or vegetarian, mostly fried. Another kind of pastry is the pastelito, with the only difference in comparison to empanadas is that they are bigger.

Typical Panamanian foods are mild-flavored, without the pungency of some of Panama&#x27;s Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Common ingredients are maize, rice, wheat flour, plantains, &quot;yuca&quot; (cassava), beef, chicken, pork and seafood.

===Traditional clothing===
Panamanian men&#x27;s traditional clothing, called &quot;montuno&quot;, consists of white cotton shirts, trousers and woven straw hats.

The traditional women&#x27;s clothing is the &quot;pollera&quot;. It originated in Spain in the 16th century, and by the early 1800s it was typical in Panama, worn by female servants, especially wet nurses (&quot;De Zarate&quot; 5). Later, it was adopted by upper-class women.

A &quot;pollera&quot; is made of &quot;cambric&quot; or &quot;fine linen&quot; (Baker 177). It is white, and is usually about 13 yards of material.

The original &quot;pollera&quot; consists of a ruffled blouse worn off the shoulders and a skirt with gold buttons. The skirt is also ruffled, so that when it is lifted up, it looks like a peacock&#x27;s tail or a &quot;mantilla&quot; fan. The designs on the skirt and blouse are usually flowers or birds. Two large matching pom poms (&quot;mota&quot;) are on the front and back, four ribbons hang from the front and back from the waist, five gold chains (&quot;caberstrillos&quot;) hang from the neck to the waist, a gold cross or medallion on a black ribbon is worn as a choker, and a silk purse is worn at the waistline. Earrings (&quot;zaricillos&quot;) are usually gold or coral. Slippers usually match the color of the &quot;pollera&quot;. Hair is usually worn in a bun, held by three large gold combs that have pearls (&quot;tembleques&quot;) worn like a crown. Quality &quot;pollera&quot; can cost up to $10,000, and may take a year to complete.

Today, there are different types of &quot;polleras&quot;; the &quot;pollera de gala&quot; consists of a short-sleeved ruffle skirt blouse, two full-length skirts and a petticoat. Girls wear &quot;tembleques&quot; in their hair. Gold coins and jewelry are added to the outfit. The &quot;pollera montuna&quot; is a daily dress, with a blouse, a skirt with a solid color, a single gold chain, and pendant earrings and a natural flower in the hair. Instead of an off-the-shoulder blouse it is worn with a fitted white jacket that has shoulder pleats and a flared hem.

Traditional clothing in Panama can be worn in parades, where the females and males do a traditional dance. Females gently sway and twirl their skirts, while men hold their hats in their hands and dance behind the females.

===Literature===
The first literature relating to Panama can be dated to 1535, with a modern literary movement appearing from the mid-19th century onwards

<text>In mathematics, a polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of indeterminates (also called variables) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and exponentiation to nonnegative integer powers, and has a finite number of terms. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate is . An example with three indeterminates is .

Polynomials appear in many areas of mathematics and science. For example, they are used to form polynomial equations, which encode a wide range of problems, from elementary word problems to complicated scientific problems; they are used to define polynomial functions, which appear in settings ranging from basic chemistry and physics to economics and social science; and they are used in calculus and numerical analysis to approximate other functions. In advanced mathematics, polynomials are used to construct polynomial rings and algebraic varieties, which are central concepts in algebra and algebraic geometry.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;polynomial&quot; joins two diverse roots: the Greek &quot;poly&quot;, meaning &quot;many&quot;, and the Latin &quot;nomen&quot;, or &quot;name&quot;. It was derived from the term &quot;binomial&quot; by replacing the Latin root &quot;bi-&quot; with the Greek &quot;poly-&quot;. That is, it means a sum of many terms (many monomials). The word &quot;polynomial&quot; was first used in the 17th century.
== Notation and terminology ==
The &quot;x&quot; occurring in a polynomial is commonly called a &quot;variable&quot; or an &quot;indeterminate&quot;. When the polynomial is considered as an expression, &quot;x&quot; is a fixed symbol which does not have any value (its value is &quot;indeterminate&quot;). However, when one considers the function defined by the polynomial, then &quot;x&quot; represents the argument of the function, and is therefore called a &quot;variable&quot;. Many authors use these two words interchangeably.

A polynomial &quot;P&quot; in the indeterminate &quot;x&quot; is commonly denoted either as &quot;P&quot; or as &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Formally, the name of the polynomial is &quot;P&quot;, not &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), but the use of the functional notation &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) dates from a time when the distinction between a polynomial and the associated function was unclear. Moreover, the functional notation is often useful for specifying, in a single phrase, a polynomial and its indeterminate. For example, &quot;let &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) be a polynomial&quot; is a shorthand for &quot;let &quot;P&quot; be a polynomial in the indeterminate &quot;x&quot;&quot;. On the other hand, when it is not necessary to emphasize the name of the indeterminate, many formulas are much simpler and easier to read if the name(s) of the indeterminate(s) do not appear at each occurrence of the polynomial.

The ambiguity of having two notations for a single mathematical object may be formally resolved by considering the general meaning of the functional notation for polynomials.
If &quot;a&quot; denotes a number, a variable, another polynomial, or, more generally, any expression, then &quot;P&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) denotes, by convention, the result of substituting &quot;a&quot; for &quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot;. Thus, the polynomial &quot;P&quot; defines the function
formula_1
which is the &quot;polynomial function&quot; associated to &quot;P&quot;.
Frequently, when using this notation, one supposes that &quot;a&quot; is a number. However, one may use it over any domain where addition and multiplication are defined (that is, any ring). In particular, if &quot;a&quot; is a polynomial then &quot;P&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is also a polynomial.
More specifically, when &quot;a&quot; is the indeterminate &quot;x&quot;, then the image of &quot;x&quot; by this function is the polynomial &quot;P&quot; itself (substituting &quot;x&quot; for &quot;x&quot; does not change anything). In other words,
formula_2
which justifies formally the existence of two notations for the same polynomial.

== Definition ==
A &quot;polynomial expression&quot; is an expression that can be built from constants and symbols called &quot;variables&quot; or &quot;indeterminates&quot; by means of addition, multiplication and exponentiation to a non-negative integer power. The constants are generally numbers, but may be any expression that do not involve the indeterminates, and represent mathematical objects that can be added and multiplied. Two polynomial expressions are considered as defining the same &quot;polynomial&quot; if they may be transformed, one to the other, by applying the usual properties of commutativity, associativity and distributivity of addition and multiplication. For example formula_3 and formula_4 are two polynomial expressions that represent the same polynomial; so, one has the equality formula_5.

A polynomial in a single indeterminate can always be written (or rewritten) in the form
formula_6
where formula_7 are constants that are called the &quot;coefficients&quot; of the polynomial, and formula_8 is the indeterminate. The word &quot;indeterminate&quot; means that formula_8 represents no particular value, although any value may be substituted for it. The mapping that associates the result of this substitution to the substituted value is a function, called a &quot;polynomial function&quot;.

This can be expressed more concisely by using summation notation:
formula_10
That is, a polynomial can either be zero or can be written as the sum of a finite number of non-zero terms. Each term consists of the product of a number called the coefficient of the term and a finite number of indeterminates, raised to non-negative integer powers.

== Classification ==

The exponent on an indeterminate in a term is called the degree of that indeterminate in that term; the degree of the term is the sum of the degrees of the indeterminates in that term, and the degree of a polynomial is the largest degree of any term with nonzero coefficient. Because , the degree of an indeterminate without a written exponent is one.
A term with no indeterminates and a polynomial with no indeterminates are called, respectively, a constant term and a constant polynomial. The degree of a constant term and of a nonzero constant polynomial is 0. The degree of the zero polynomial 0 (which has no terms at all) is generally treated as not defined (but see below).

For example:
formula_11
is a term. The coefficient is , the indeterminates are and , the degree of is two, while the degree of is one. The degree of the entire term is the sum of the degrees of each indeterminate in it, so in this example the degree is .

Forming a sum of several terms produces a polynomial. For example, the following is a polynomial:
formula_12
It consists of three terms: the first is degree two, the second is degree one, and the third is degree zero.

Polynomials of small degree have been given specific names. A polynomial of degree zero is a &quot;constant polynomial&quot;, or simply a &quot;constant&quot;. Polynomials of degree one, two or three are respectively &quot;linear polynomials,&quot; &quot;quadratic polynomials&quot; and &quot;cubic polynomials&quot;. For higher degrees, the specific names are not commonly used, although &quot;quartic polynomial&quot; (for degree four) and &quot;quintic polynomial&quot; (for degree five) are sometimes used. The names for the degrees may be applied to the polynomial or to its terms. For example, the term in is a linear term in a quadratic polynomial.

The polynomial 0, which may be considered to have no terms at all, is called the zero polynomial. Unlike other constant polynomials, its degree is not zero. Rather, the degree of the zero polynomial is either left explicitly undefined, or defined as negative (either −1 or −∞). The zero polynomial is also unique in that it is the only polynomial in one indeterminate that has an infinite number of roots. The graph of the zero polynomial, , is the &quot;x&quot;-axis.

In the case of polynomials in more than one indeterminate, a polynomial is called &quot;homogeneous&quot; of if &quot;all&quot; of its non-zero terms have . The zero polynomial is homogeneous, and, as a homogeneous polynomial, its degree is undefined. For example, is homogeneous of degree 5. For more details, see Homogeneous polynomial.

The commutative law of addition can be used to rearrange terms into any preferred order. In polynomials with one indeterminate, the terms are usually ordered according to degree, either in &quot;descending powers of &quot;, with the term of largest degree first, or in &quot;ascending powers of &quot;. The polynomial is written in descending powers of . The first term has coefficient , indeterminate , and exponent . In the second term, the coefficient . The third term is a constant. Because the &quot;degree&quot; of a non-zero polynomial is the largest degree of any one term, this polynomial has degree two.

Two terms with the same indeterminates raised to the same powers are called &quot;similar terms&quot; or &quot;like terms&quot;, and they can be combined, using the distributive law, into a single term whose coefficient is the sum of the coefficients of the terms that were combined. It may happen that this makes the coefficient 0. Polynomials can be classified by the number of terms with nonzero coefficients, so that a one-term polynomial is called a monomial, a two-term polynomial is called a binomial, and a three-term polynomial is called a trinomial.

A real polynomial is a polynomial with real coefficients. When it is used to define a function, the domain is not so restricted. However, a real polynomial function is a function from the reals to the reals that is defined by a real polynomial. Similarly, an integer polynomial is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and a complex polynomial is a polynomial with complex coefficients.

A polynomial in one indeterminate is called a univariate polynomial, a polynomial in more than one indeterminate is called a multivariate polynomial. A polynomial with two indeterminates is called a bivariate polynomial. These notions refer more to the kind of polynomials one is generally working with than to individual polynomials; for instance, when working with univariate polynomials, one does not exclude constant polynomials (which may result from the subtraction of non-constant polynomials), although strictly speaking, constant polynomials do not contain any indeterminates at all. It is possible to further classify multivariate polynomials as &quot;bivariate&quot;, &quot;trivariate&quot;, and so on, according to the maximum number of indeterminates allowed. Again, so that the set of objects under consideration be closed under subtraction, a study of trivariate polynomials usually allows bivariate polynomials, and so on. It is also common to say simply &quot;polynomials in , and &quot;, listing the indeterminates allowed.

== Operations ==
=== Addition and subtraction ===
Polynomials can be added using the associative law of addition (grouping all their terms together into a single sum), possibly followed by reordering (using the commutative law) and combining of like terms. For example, if
formula_13 and formula_14
then the sum
formula_15
can be reordered and regrouped as
formula_16
and then simplified to
formula_17
When polynomials are added together, the result is another polynomial.

Subtraction of polynomials is similar.

=== Multiplication ===

Polynomials can also be multiplied. To expand the product of two polynomials into a sum of terms, the distributive law is repeatedly applied, which results in each term of one polynomial being multiplied by every term of the other. For example, if
formula_18
then
formula_19
Carrying out the multiplication in each term produces
formula_20
Combining similar terms yields
formula_21
which can be simplified to
formula_22
As in the example, the product of polynomials is always a polynomial.

=== Composition ===
Given a polynomial formula_23 of a single variable and another polynomial of any number of variables, the composition formula_24 is obtained by substituting each copy of the variable of the first polynomial by the second polynomial. For example, if formula_25 and formula_26 then
formula_27
A composition may be expanded to a sum of terms using the rules for multiplication and division of polynomials. The composition of two polynomials is another polynomial.
=== Division ===

The division of one polynomial by another is not typically a polynomial. Instead, such ratios are a more general family of objects, called &quot;rational fractions&quot;, &quot;rational expressions&quot;, or &quot;rational functions&quot;, depending on context. This is analogous to the fact that the ratio of two integers is a rational number, not necessarily an integer. For example, the fraction is not a polynomial, and it cannot be written as a finite sum of powers of the variable .

For polynomials in one variable, there is a notion of Euclidean division of polynomials, generalizing the Euclidean division of integers. This notion of the division results in two polynomials, a &quot;quotient&quot; and a &quot;remainder&quot; , such that and . The quotient and remainder may be computed by any of several algorithms, including polynomial long division and synthetic division.

When the denominator is monic and linear, that is, for some constant , then the polynomial remainder theorem asserts that the remainder of the division of by is the evaluation . In this case, the quotient may be computed by Ruffini&#x27;s rule, a special case of synthetic division.

=== Factoring ===
All polynomials with coefficients in a unique factorization domain (for example, the integers or a field) also have a factored form in which the polynomial is written as a product of irreducible polynomials and a constant. This factored form is unique up to the order of the factors and their multiplication by an invertible constant. In the case of the field of complex numbers, the irreducible factors are linear. Over the real numbers, they have the degree either one or two. Over the integers and the rational numbers the irreducible factors may have any degree. For example, the factored form of
formula_28
is
formula_29
over the integers and the reals, and
formula_30
over the complex numbers.

The computation of the factored form, called &quot;factorization&quot; is, in general, too difficult to be done by hand-written computation. However, efficient polynomial factorization algorithms are available in most computer algebra systems.

=== Calculus ===

Calculating derivatives and integrals of polynomials is particularly simple, compared to other kinds of functions.
The derivative of the polynomial formula_31 with respect to is the polynomial 
formula_32
Similarly, the general antiderivative (or indefinite integral) of formula_33 is
formula_34
where is an arbitrary constant. For example, antiderivatives of have the form .

For polynomials whose coefficients come from more abstract settings (for example, if the coefficients are integers modulo some prime number , or elements of an arbitrary ring), the formula for the derivative can still be interpreted formally, with the coefficient understood to mean the sum of copies of . For example, over the integers modulo , the derivative of the polynomial is the polynomial .

== Polynomial functions ==

A &quot;polynomial function&quot; is a function that can be defined by evaluating a polynomial. More precisely, a function of one argument from a given domain is a polynomial function if there exists a polynomial
formula_35
that evaluates to formula_36 for all in the domain of (here, is a non-negative integer and are constant coefficients).
Generally, unless otherwise specified, polynomial functions have complex coefficients, arguments, and values. In particular, a polynomial, restricted to have real coefficients, defines a function from the complex numbers to the complex numbers. If the domain of this function is also restricted to the reals, the resulting function is a real function that maps reals to reals.

For example, the function , defined by
formula_37
is a polynomial function of one variable. Polynomial functions of several variables are similarly defined, using polynomials in more than one indeterminate, as in
formula_38
According to the definition of polynomial functions, there may be expressions that obviously are not polynomials but nevertheless define polynomial functions. An example is the expression formula_39 which takes the same values as the polynomial formula_40 on the interval formula_41, and thus both expressions define the same polynomial function on this interval.

Every polynomial function is continuous, smooth, and entire.

The evaluation of a polynomial is the computation of the corresponding polynomial function; that is, the evaluation consists of substituting a numerical value to each indeterminate and carrying out the indicated multiplications and additions.

For polynomials in one indeterminate, the evaluation is usually more efficient (lower number of arithmetic operations to perform) using Horner&#x27;s method, which consists of rewriting the polynomial as
formula_42

=== Graphs ===

A polynomial function in one real variable can be represented by a graph.
A non-constant polynomial function tends to infinity when the variable increases indefinitely (in absolute value). If the degree is higher than one, the graph does not have any asymptote. It has two parabolic branches with vertical direction (one branch for positive &quot;x&quot; and one for negative &quot;x&quot;).

Polynomial graphs are analyzed in calculus using intercepts, slopes, concavity, and end behavior.

== Equations ==

A &quot;polynomial equation&quot;, also called an &quot;algebraic equation&quot;, is an equation of the form
formula_43
For example,
formula_44
is a polynomial equation.

When considering equations, the indeterminates (variables) of polynomials are also called unknowns, and the &quot;solutions&quot; are the possible values of the unknowns for which the equality is true (in general more than one solution may exist). A polynomial equation stands in contrast to a &quot;polynomial identity&quot; like , where both expressions represent the same polynomial in different forms, and as a consequence any evaluation of both members gives a valid equality.

In elementary algebra, methods such as the quadratic formula are taught for solving all first degree and second degree polynomial equations in one variable. There are also formulas for the cubic and quartic equations. For higher degrees, the Abel–Ruffini theorem asserts that there can not exist a general formula in radicals. However, root-finding algorithms may be used to find numerical approximations of the roots of a polynomial expression of any degree.

The number of solutions of a polynomial equation with real coefficients may not exceed the degree, and equals the degree when the complex solutions are counted with their multiplicity. This fact is called the fundamental theorem of algebra.

=== Solving equations ===


A &quot;root&quot; of a nonzero univariate polynomial is a value of such that . In other words, a root of is a solution of the polynomial equation or a zero of the polynomial function defined by . In the case of the zero polynomial, every number is a zero of the corresponding function, and the concept of root is rarely considered.

A number is a root of a polynomial if and only if the linear polynomial divides , that is if there is another polynomial such that . It may happen that a power (greater than ) of divides ; in this case, is a &quot;multiple root&quot; of , and otherwise is a simple root of . If is a nonzero polynomial, there is a highest power such that divides , which is called the &quot;multiplicity&quot; of as a root of . The number of roots of a nonzero polynomial , counted with their respective multiplicities, cannot exceed the degree of , and equals this degree if all complex roots are considered (this is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of algebra).
The coefficients of a polynomial and its roots are related by Vieta&#x27;s formulas.

Some polynomials, such as , do not have any roots among the real numbers. If, however, the set of accepted solutions is expanded to the complex numbers, every non-constant polynomial has at least one root; this is the fundamental theorem of algebra. By successively dividing out factors , one sees that any polynomial with complex coefficients can be written as a constant (its leading coefficient) times a product of such polynomial factors of degree 1; as a consequence, the number of (complex) roots counted with their multiplicities is exactly equal to the degree of the polynomial.

There may be several meanings of &quot;solving an equation&quot;. One may want to express the solutions as explicit numbers; for example, the unique solution of is . This is, in general, impossible for equations of degree greater than one, and, since the ancient times, mathematicians have searched to express the solutions as algebraic expressions; for example, the golden ratio formula_45 is the unique positive solution of formula_46 In the ancient times, they succeeded only for degrees one and two. For quadratic equations, the quadratic formula provides such expressions of the solutions. Since the 16th century, similar formulas (using cube roots in addition to square roots), although much more complicated, are known for equations of degree three and four (see cubic equation and quartic equation). But formulas for degree 5 and higher eluded researchers for several centuries. In 1824, Niels Henrik Abel proved the striking result that there are equations of degree 5 whose solutions cannot be expressed by a (finite) formula, involving only arithmetic operations and radicals (see Abel–Ruffini theorem). In 1830, Évariste Galois proved that most equations of degree higher than four cannot be solved by radicals, and showed that for each equation, one may decide whether it is solvable by radicals, and, if it is, solve it. This result marked the start of Galois theory and group theory, two important branches of modern algebra. Galois himself noted that the computations implied by his method were impracticable. Nevertheless, formulas for solvable equations of degrees 5 and 6 have been published (see quintic function and sextic equation).

When there is no algebraic expression for the roots, and when such an algebraic expression exists but is too complicated to be useful, the unique way of solving it is to compute numerical approximations of the solutions. There are many methods for that; some are restricted to polynomials and others may apply to any continuous function. The most efficient algorithms allow solving easily (on a computer) polynomial equations of degree higher than 1,000 (see &quot;Root-finding algorithm&quot;).

For polynomials with more than one indeterminate, the combinations of values for the variables for which the polynomial function takes the value zero are generally called &quot;zeros&quot; instead of &quot;roots&quot;. The study of the sets of zeros of polynomials is the object of algebraic geometry. For a set of polynomial equations with several unknowns, there are algorithms to decide whether they have a finite number of complex solutions, and, if this number is finite, for computing the solutions. See System of polynomial equations.

The special case where all the polynomials are of degree one is called a system of linear equations, for which another range of different solution methods exist, including the classical Gaussian elimination.

A polynomial equation for which one is interested only in the solutions which are integers is called a Diophantine equation. Solving Diophantine equations is generally a very hard task. It has been proved that there cannot be any general algorithm for solving them, or even for deciding whether the set of solutions is empty (see Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem). Some of the most famous problems that have been solved during the last fifty years are related to Diophantine equations, such as Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

== Polynomial expressions ==

Polynomials where indeterminates are substituted for some other mathematical objects are often considered, and sometimes have a special name.

=== Trigonometric polynomials ===

A trigonometric polynomial is a finite linear combination of functions sin(&quot;nx&quot;) and cos(&quot;nx&quot;) with &quot;n&quot; taking on the values of one or more natural numbers. The coefficients may be taken as real numbers, for real-valued functions.

If sin(&quot;nx&quot;) and cos(&quot;nx&quot;) are expanded in terms of sin(&quot;x&quot;) and cos(&quot;x&quot;), a trigonometric polynomial becomes a polynomial in the two variables sin(&quot;x&quot;) and cos(&quot;x&quot;) (using List of trigonometric identities#Multiple-angle formulae). Conversely, every polynomial in sin(&quot;x&quot;) and cos(&quot;x&quot;) may be converted, with Product-to-sum identities, into a linear combination of functions sin(&quot;nx&quot;) and cos(&quot;nx&quot;). This equivalence explains why linear combinations are called polynomials.

For complex coefficients, there is no difference between such a function and a finite Fourier series.

Trigonometric polynomials are widely used, for example in trigonometric interpolation applied to the interpolation of periodic functions. They are also used in the discrete Fourier transform.

=== Matrix polynomials ===

A matrix polynomial is a polynomial with square matrices as variables. Given an ordinary, scalar-valued polynomial
formula_47
this polynomial evaluated at a matrix &quot;A&quot; is
formula_48
where &quot;I&quot; is the identity matrix.

A matrix polynomial equation is an equality between two matrix polynomials, which holds for the specific matrices in question. A matrix polynomial identity is a matrix polynomial equation which holds for all matrices &quot;A&quot; in a specified matrix ring &quot;Mn&quot;(&quot;R&quot;).

=== Exponential polynomials ===
A bivariate polynomial where the second variable is substituted for an exponential function applied to the first variable, for example , may be called an exponential polynomial.

== Related concepts ==

=== Rational functions ===

A rational fraction is the quotient (algebraic fraction) of two polynomials. Any algebraic expression that can be rewritten as a rational fraction is a rational function.

While polynomial functions are defined for all values of the variables, a rational function is defined only for the values of the variables for which the denominator is not zero.

The rational fractions include the Laurent polynomials, but do not limit denominators to powers of an indeterminate.

=== Laurent polynomials ===

Laurent polynomials are like polynomials, but allow negative powers of the variable(s) to occur.

=== Power series ===

Formal power series are like polynomials, but allow infinitely many non-zero terms to occur, so that they do not have finite degree. Unlike polynomials they cannot in general be explicitly and fully written down (just like irrational numbers cannot), but the rules for manipulating their terms are the same as for polynomials. Non-formal power series also generalize polynomials, but the multiplication of two power series may not converge.

== Polynomial ring ==

A &quot;polynomial&quot; over a commutative ring is a polynomial all of whose coefficients belong to . It is straightforward to verify that the polynomials in a given set of indeterminates over form a commutative ring, called the &quot;polynomial ring&quot; in these indeterminates, denoted formula_49 in the univariate case and formula_50 in the multivariate case.

One has 
formula_51
So, most of the theory of the multivariate case can be reduced to an iterated univariate case.

The map from to sending to itself considered as a constant polynomial is an injective ring homomorphism, by which is viewed as a subring of . In particular, is an algebra over .

One can think of the ring as arising from by adding one new element &quot;x&quot; to &quot;R&quot;, and extending in a minimal way to a ring in which satisfies no other relations than the obligatory ones, plus commutation with all elements of (that is ). To do this, one must add all powers of and their linear combinations as well.

Formation of the polynomial ring, together with forming factor rings by factoring out ideals, are important tools for constructing new rings out of known ones. For instance, the ring (in fact field) of complex numbers, which can be constructed from the polynomial ring over the real numbers by factoring out the ideal of multiples of the polynomial . Another example is the construction of finite fields, which proceeds similarly, starting out with the field of integers modulo some prime number as the coefficient ring (see modular arithmetic).

If is commutative, then one can associate with every polynomial in a &quot;polynomial function&quot; with domain and range equal to . (More generally, one can take domain and range to be any same unital associative algebra over .) One obtains the value by substitution of the value for the symbol in . One reason to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that, over some rings, different polynomials may give rise to the same polynomial function (see Fermat&#x27;s little theorem for an example where is the integers modulo ). This is not the case when is the real or complex numbers, whence the two concepts are not always distinguished in analysis. An even more important reason to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that many operations on polynomials (like Euclidean division) require looking at what a polynomial is composed of as an expression rather than evaluating it at some constant value for .

=== Divisibility ===

If is an integral domain and and are polynomials in , it is said that &quot;divides&quot; or is a divisor of if there exists a polynomial in such that . If formula_52 then is a root of if and only formula_53 divides . In this case, the quotient can be computed using the polynomial long division.

If is a field and and are polynomials in with , then there exist unique polynomials and in with
formula_54
and such that the degree of is smaller than the degree of (using the convention that the polynomial 0 has a negative degree). The polynomials and are uniquely determined by and . This is called &quot;Euclidean division, division with remainder&quot; or &quot;polynomial long division&quot; and shows that the ring is a Euclidean domain.

Analogously, &quot;prime polynomials&quot; (more correctly, &quot;irreducible polynomials&quot;) can be defined as &quot;non-zero polynomials which cannot be factorized into the product of two non-constant polynomials&quot;. In the case of coefficients in a ring, &quot;non-constant&quot; must be replaced by &quot;non-constant or non-unit&quot; (both definitions agree in the case of coefficients in a field). Any polynomial may be decomposed into the product of an invertible constant by a product of irreducible polynomials. If the coefficients belong to a field or a unique factorization domain this decomposition is unique up to the order of the factors and the multiplication of any non-unit factor by a unit (and division of the unit factor by the same unit). When the coefficients belong to integers, rational numbers or a finite field, there are algorithms to test irreducibility and to compute the factorization into irreducible polynomials (see &quot;Factorization of polynomials&quot;). These algorithms are not practicable for hand-written computation, but are available in any computer algebra system. Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion can also be used in some cases to determine irreducibility.

== Applications ==
=== Positional notation ===

In modern positional numbers systems, such as the decimal system, the digits and their positions in the representation of an integer, for example, 45, are a shorthand notation for a polynomial in the radix or base, in this case, . As another example, in radix 5, a string of digits such as 132 denotes the (decimal) number = 42. This representation is unique. Let &quot;b&quot; be a positive integer greater than 1. Then every positive integer &quot;a&quot; can be expressed uniquely in the form

formula_55
where &quot;m&quot; is a nonnegative integer and the &quot;r&quot;&#x27;s are integers such that

 and for .

=== Interpolation and approximation ===

The simple structure of polynomial functions makes them quite useful in analyzing general functions using polynomial approximations. An important example in calculus is Taylor&#x27;s theorem, which roughly states that every differentiable function locally looks like a polynomial function, and the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, which states that every continuous function defined on a compact interval of the real axis can be approximated on the whole interval as closely as desired by a polynomial function. Practical methods of approximation include polynomial interpolation and the use of splines.

=== Other applications ===
Polynomials are frequently used to encode information about some other object. The characteristic polynomial of a matrix or linear operator contains information about the operator&#x27;s eigenvalues. The minimal polynomial of an algebraic element records the simplest algebraic relation satisfied by that element. The chromatic polynomial of a graph counts the number of proper colourings of that graph.

The term &quot;polynomial&quot;, as an adjective, can also be used for quantities or functions that can be written in polynomial form. For example, in computational complexity theory the phrase &quot;polynomial time&quot; means that the time it takes to complete an algorithm is bounded by a polynomial function of some variable, such as the size of the input.

== History ==

Determining the roots of polynomials, or &quot;solving algebraic equations&quot;, is among the oldest problems in mathematics. However, the elegant and practical notation we use today only developed beginning in the 15th century. Before that, equations were written out in words. For example, an algebra problem from the Chinese Arithmetic in Nine Sections, , begins &quot;Three sheafs of good crop, two sheafs of mediocre crop, and one sheaf of bad crop are sold for 29 dou.&quot; We would write .

=== History of the notation ===

The earliest known use of the equal sign is in Robert Recorde&#x27;s &quot;The Whetstone of Witte&quot;, 1557. The signs + for addition, − for subtraction, and the use of a letter for an unknown appear in Michael Stifel&#x27;s &quot;Arithemetica integra&quot;, 1544. René Descartes, in &quot;La géometrie&quot;, 1637, introduced the concept of the graph of a polynomial equation. He popularized the use of letters from the beginning of the alphabet to denote constants and letters from the end of the alphabet to denote variables, as can be seen above, in the general formula for a polynomial in one variable, where the s denote constants and denotes a variable. Descartes introduced the use of superscripts to denote exponents as well.

<text>A polymer () is a substance or material that consists of very large molecules, or macromolecules, that are constituted by many repeating subunits derived from one or more species of monomers. Due to their broad spectrum of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life. Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass, relative to small molecule compounds, produces unique physical properties including toughness, high elasticity, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form amorphous and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals.
Polymers are studied in the fields of polymer science (which includes polymer chemistry and polymer physics), biophysics and materials science and engineering. Historically, products arising from the linkage of repeating units by covalent chemical bonds have been the primary focus of polymer science. An emerging important area now focuses on supramolecular polymers formed by non-covalent links. Polyisoprene of latex rubber is an example of a natural polymer, and the polystyrene of styrofoam is an example of a synthetic polymer. In biological contexts, essentially all biological macromolecules—i.e., proteins (polyamides), nucleic acids (polynucleotides), and polysaccharides—are purely polymeric, or are composed in large part of polymeric components.


== Etymology ==
The term &quot;polymer&quot; derives . The term was coined in 1833 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, though with a definition distinct from the modern IUPAC definition. The modern concept of polymers as covalently bonded macromolecular structures was proposed in 1920 by Hermann Staudinger, who spent the next decade finding experimental evidence for this hypothesis.

==Common examples==


Polymers are of two types: naturally occurring and synthetic or &quot;man made&quot;.

===Natural===
Natural polymeric materials such as hemp, shellac, amber, wool, silk, and natural rubber have been used for centuries. A variety of other natural polymers exist, such as cellulose, which is the main constituent of wood and paper.

====Space polymer====
Hemoglycin (previously termed hemolithin) is a space polymer that is the first polymer of amino acids found in meteorites.

===Synthetic===
The list of synthetic polymers, roughly in order of worldwide demand, includes polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, synthetic rubber, phenol formaldehyde resin (or Bakelite), neoprene, nylon, polyacrylonitrile, PVB, silicone, and many more. More than 330 million tons of these polymers are made every year (2015).

Most commonly, the continuously linked backbone of a polymer used for the preparation of plastics consists mainly of carbon atoms. A simple example is polyethylene (&#x27;polythene&#x27; in British English), whose repeat unit or monomer is ethylene. Many other structures do exist; for example, elements such as silicon form familiar materials such as silicones, examples being Silly Putty and waterproof plumbing sealant. Oxygen is also commonly present in polymer backbones, such as those of polyethylene glycol, polysaccharides (in glycosidic bonds), and DNA (in phosphodiester bonds).

==Synthesis==

Polymerization is the process of combining many small molecules known as monomers into a covalently bonded chain or network. During the polymerization process, some chemical groups may be lost from each monomer. This happens in the polymerization of PET polyester. The monomers are terephthalic acid (HOOCC6H4COOH) and ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH) but the repeating unit is OCC6H4COOCH2CH2O, which corresponds to the combination of the two monomers with the loss of two water molecules. The distinct piece of each monomer that is incorporated into the polymer is known as a repeat unit or monomer residue.

Synthetic methods are generally divided into two categories, step-growth polymerization and chain polymerization. The essential difference between the two is that in chain polymerization, monomers are added to the chain one at a time only, such as in polystyrene, whereas in step-growth polymerization chains of monomers may combine with one another directly, such as in polyester. Step-growth polymerization can be divided into polycondensation, in which low-molar-mass by-product is formed in every reaction step, and polyaddition.
Newer methods, such as plasma polymerization do not fit neatly into either category. Synthetic polymerization reactions may be carried out with or without a catalyst. Laboratory synthesis of biopolymers, especially of proteins, is an area of intensive research.

===Biological synthesis===


There are three main classes of biopolymers: polysaccharides, polypeptides, and polynucleotides.
In living cells, they may be synthesized by enzyme-mediated processes, such as the formation of DNA catalyzed by DNA polymerase. The synthesis of proteins involves multiple enzyme-mediated processes to transcribe genetic information from the DNA to RNA and subsequently translate that information to synthesize the specified protein from amino acids. The protein may be modified further following translation in order to provide appropriate structure and functioning. There are other biopolymers such as rubber, suberin, melanin, and lignin.

Naturally occurring polymers such as cotton, starch, and rubber were familiar materials for years before synthetic polymers such as polyethene and perspex appeared on the market. Many commercially important polymers are synthesized by chemical modification of naturally occurring polymers. Prominent examples include the reaction of nitric acid and cellulose to form nitrocellulose and the formation of vulcanized rubber by heating natural rubber in the presence of sulfur. Ways in which polymers can be modified include oxidation, cross-linking, and end-capping.

==Structure==

The structure of a polymeric material can be described at different length scales, from the sub-nm length scale up to the macroscopic one. There is in fact a hierarchy of structures, in which each stage provides the foundations for the next one.
The starting point for the description of the structure of a polymer is the identity of its constituent monomers. Next, the microstructure essentially describes the arrangement of these monomers within the polymer at the scale of a single chain. The microstructure determines the possibility for the polymer to form phases with different arrangements, for example through crystallization, the glass transition or microphase separation.
These features play a major role in determining the physical and chemical properties of a polymer.

===Monomers and repeat units===
The identity of the repeat units (monomer residues, also known as &quot;mers&quot;) comprising a polymer is its first and most important attribute. Polymer nomenclature is generally based upon the type of monomer residues comprising the polymer. A polymer which contains only a single type of repeat unit is known as a homopolymer, while a polymer containing two or more types of repeat units is known as a copolymer. A terpolymer is a copolymer which contains three types of repeat units.

Polystyrene is composed only of styrene-based repeat units, and is classified as a homopolymer. Polyethylene terephthalate, even though produced from two different monomers (ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid), is usually regarded as a homopolymer because only one type of repeat unit is formed. Ethylene-vinyl acetate contains more than one variety of repeat unit and is a copolymer. Some biological polymers are composed of a variety of different but structurally related monomer residues; for example, polynucleotides such as DNA are composed of four types of nucleotide subunits.

A polymer containing ionizable subunits (e.g., pendant carboxylic groups) is known as a polyelectrolyte or ionomer, when the fraction of ionizable units is large or small respectively.

===Microstructure===

The microstructure of a polymer (sometimes called configuration) relates to the physical arrangement of monomer residues along the backbone of the chain. These are the elements of polymer structure that require the breaking of a covalent bond in order to change. Various polymer structures can be produced depending on the monomers and reaction conditions: A polymer may consist of linear macromolecules containing each only one unbranched chain. In the case of unbranched polyethylene, this chain is a long-chain &quot;n&quot;-alkane. There are also branched macromolecules with a main chain and side chains, in the case of polyethylene the side chains would be alkyl groups. In particular unbranched macromolecules can be in the solid state semi-crystalline, crystalline chain sections highlighted red in the figure below.

While branched and unbranched polymers are usually thermoplastics, many elastomers have a wide-meshed cross-linking between the &quot;main chains&quot;. Close-meshed crosslinking, on the other hand, leads to thermosets. Cross-links and branches are shown as red dots in the figures. Highly branched polymers are amorphous and the molecules in the solid interact randomly.

====Polymer architecture====

An important microstructural feature of a polymer is its architecture and shape, which relates to the way branch points lead to a deviation from a simple linear chain. A branched polymer molecule is composed of a main chain with one or more substituent side chains or branches. Types of branched polymers include star polymers, comb polymers, polymer brushes, dendronized polymers, ladder polymers, and dendrimers. There exist also two-dimensional polymers (2DP) which are composed of topologically planar repeat units. A polymer&#x27;s architecture affects many of its physical properties including solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, glass-transition temperature and the size of individual polymer coils in solution. A variety of techniques may be employed for the synthesis of a polymeric material with a range of architectures, for example living polymerization.

====Chain length====
A common means of expressing the length of a chain is the degree of polymerization, which quantifies the number of monomers incorporated into the chain. As with other molecules, a polymer&#x27;s size may also be expressed in terms of molecular weight. Since synthetic polymerization techniques typically yield a statistical distribution of chain lengths, the molecular weight is expressed in terms of weighted averages. The number-average molecular weight (&quot;M&quot;n) and weight-average molecular weight (&quot;M&quot;w) are most commonly reported. The ratio of these two values (&quot;M&quot;w / &quot;M&quot;n) is the dispersity (&quot;Đ&quot;), which is commonly used to express the width of the molecular weight distribution.

The physical properties of polymer strongly depend on the length (or equivalently, the molecular weight) of the polymer chain. One important example of the physical consequences of the molecular weight is the scaling of the viscosity (resistance to flow) in the melt. The influence of the weight-average molecular weight (formula_1) on the melt viscosity (formula_2) depends on whether the polymer is above or below the onset of entanglements. Below the entanglement molecular weight, formula_3, whereas above the entanglement molecular weight, formula_4. In the latter case, increasing the polymer chain length 10-fold would increase the viscosity over 1000 times. Increasing chain length furthermore tends to decrease chain mobility, increase strength and toughness, and increase the glass-transition temperature (Tg). This is a result of the increase in chain interactions such as van der Waals attractions and entanglements that come with increased chain length. These interactions tend to fix the individual chains more strongly in position and resist deformations and matrix breakup, both at higher stresses and higher temperatures.

====Monomer arrangement in copolymers====
Copolymers are classified either as statistical copolymers, alternating copolymers, block copolymers, graft copolymers or gradient copolymers. In the schematic figure below, Ⓐ and Ⓑ symbolize the two repeat units.

*Alternating copolymers possess two regularly alternating monomer residues: . An example is the equimolar copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride formed by free-radical chain-growth polymerization. A step-growth copolymer such as Nylon 66 can also be considered a strictly alternating copolymer of diamine and diacid residues, but is often described as a homopolymer with the dimeric residue of one amine and one acid as a repeat unit.
*Periodic copolymers have more than two species of monomer units in a regular sequence.
*Statistical copolymers have monomer residues arranged according to a statistical rule. A statistical copolymer in which the probability of finding a particular type of monomer residue at a particular point in the chain is independent of the types of surrounding monomer residue may be referred to as a truly random copolymer. For example, the chain-growth copolymer of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate is random.
*Block copolymers have long sequences of different monomer units. Polymers with two or three blocks of two distinct chemical species (e.g., A and B) are called diblock copolymers and triblock copolymers, respectively. Polymers with three blocks, each of a different chemical species (e.g., A, B, and C) are termed triblock terpolymers.
*Graft or grafted copolymers contain side chains or branches whose repeat units have a different composition or configuration than the main chain. The branches are added on to a preformed main chain macromolecule.

Monomers within a copolymer may be organized along the backbone in a variety of ways. A copolymer containing a controlled arrangement of monomers is called a sequence-controlled polymer. Alternating, periodic and block copolymers are simple examples of sequence-controlled polymers.

====Tacticity====

Tacticity describes the relative stereochemistry of chiral centers in neighboring structural units within a macromolecule. There are three types of tacticity: isotactic (all substituents on the same side), atactic (random placement of substituents), and syndiotactic (alternating placement of substituents).

===Morphology===
Polymer morphology generally describes the arrangement and microscale ordering of polymer chains in space. The macroscopic physical properties of a polymer are related to the interactions between the polymer chains.

* Disordered polymers: In the solid state, atactic polymers, polymers with a high degree of branching and random copolymers form amorphous (i.e. glassy structures). In melt and solution, polymers tend to form a constantly changing &quot;statistical cluster&quot;, see freely-jointed-chain model. In the solid state, the respective conformations of the molecules are frozen. Hooking and entanglement of chain molecules lead to a &quot;mechanical bond&quot; between the chains. Intermolecular and intramolecular attractive forces only occur at sites where molecule segments are close enough to each other. The irregular structures of the molecules prevent a narrower arrangement.


* Linear polymers with periodic structure, low branching and stereoregularity (e. g. not atactic) have a semi-crystalline structure in the solid state. In simple polymers (such as polyethylene), the chains are present in the crystal in zigzag conformation. Several zigzag conformations form dense chain packs, called crystallites or lamellae. The lamellae are much thinner than the polymers are long (often about 10 nm). They are formed by more or less regular folding of one or more molecular chains. Amorphous structures exist between the lamellae. Individual molecules can lead to entanglements between the lamellae and can also be involved in the formation of two (or more) lamellae (chains than called tie molecules). Several lamellae form a superstructure, a spherulite, often with a diameter in the range of 0.05 to 1 mm.
:The type and arrangement of (functional) residues of the repeat units effects or determines the crystallinity and strength of the secondary valence bonds. In isotactic polypropylene, the molecules form a helix. Like the zigzag conformation, such helices allow a dense chain packing. Particularly strong intermolecular interactions occur when the residues of the repeating units allow the formation of hydrogen bonds, as in the case of &quot;p&quot;-aramid. The formation of strong intramolecular associations may produce diverse folded states of single linear chains with distinct circuit topology. Crystallinity and superstructure are always dependent on the conditions of their formation, see also: crystallization of polymers. Compared to amorphous structures, semi-crystalline structures lead to a higher stiffness, density, melting temperature and higher resistance of a polymer.

* Cross-linked polymers: Wide-meshed cross-linked polymers are elastomers and cannot be molten (unlike thermoplastics); heating cross-linked polymers only leads to decomposition. Thermoplastic elastomers, on the other hand, are reversibly &quot;physically crosslinked&quot; and can be molten. Block copolymers in which a hard segment of the polymer has a tendency to crystallize and a soft segment has an amorphous structure are one type of thermoplastic elastomers: the hard segments ensure wide-meshed, physical crosslinking.

====Crystallinity====
When applied to polymers, the term &quot;crystalline&quot; has a somewhat ambiguous usage. In some cases, the term &quot;crystalline&quot; finds identical usage to that used in conventional crystallography. For example, the structure of a crystalline protein or polynucleotide, such as a sample prepared for x-ray crystallography, may be defined in terms of a conventional unit cell composed of one or more polymer molecules with cell dimensions of hundreds of angstroms or more. A synthetic polymer may be loosely described as crystalline if it contains regions of three-dimensional ordering on atomic (rather than macromolecular) length scales, usually arising from intramolecular folding or stacking of adjacent chains. Synthetic polymers may consist of both crystalline and amorphous regions; the degree of crystallinity may be expressed in terms of a weight fraction or volume fraction of crystalline material. Few synthetic polymers are entirely crystalline. The crystallinity of polymers is characterized by their degree of crystallinity, ranging from zero for a completely non-crystalline polymer to one for a theoretical completely crystalline polymer. Polymers with microcrystalline regions are generally tougher (can be bent more without breaking) and more impact-resistant than totally amorphous polymers. Polymers with a degree of crystallinity approaching zero or one will tend to be transparent, while polymers with intermediate degrees of crystallinity will tend to be opaque due to light scattering by crystalline or glassy regions. For many polymers, crystallinity may also be associated with decreased transparency.

====Chain conformation====
The space occupied by a polymer molecule is generally expressed in terms of radius of gyration, which is an average distance from the center of mass of the chain to the chain itself. Alternatively, it may be expressed in terms of pervaded volume, which is the volume spanned by the polymer chain and scales with the cube of the radius of gyration. 
The simplest theoretical models for polymers in the molten, amorphous state are ideal chains.

==Properties==

Polymer properties depend of their structure and they are divided into classes according to their physical bases. Many physical and chemical properties describe how a polymer behaves as a continuous macroscopic material. They are classified as bulk properties, or intensive properties according to thermodynamics.

===Mechanical properties===

The bulk properties of a polymer are those most often of end-use interest. These are the properties that dictate how the polymer actually behaves on a macroscopic scale.

====Tensile strength====
The tensile strength of a material quantifies how much elongating stress the material will endure before failure. This is very important in applications that rely upon a polymer&#x27;s physical strength or durability. For example, a rubber band with a higher tensile strength will hold a greater weight before snapping. In general, tensile strength increases with polymer chain length and crosslinking of polymer chains.

====Young&#x27;s modulus of elasticity====
Young&#x27;s modulus quantifies the elasticity of the polymer. It is defined, for small strains, as the ratio of rate of change of stress to strain. Like tensile strength, this is highly relevant in polymer applications involving the physical properties of polymers, such as rubber bands. The modulus is strongly dependent on temperature. Viscoelasticity describes a complex time-dependent elastic response, which will exhibit hysteresis in the stress-strain curve when the load is removed. Dynamic mechanical analysis or DMA measures this complex modulus by oscillating the load and measuring the resulting strain as a function of time.

===Transport properties===
Transport properties such as diffusivity describe how rapidly molecules move through the polymer matrix. These are very important in many applications of polymers for films and membranes.

The movement of individual macromolecules occurs by a process called reptation in which each chain molecule is constrained by entanglements with neighboring chains to move within a virtual tube. The theory of reptation can explain polymer molecule dynamics and viscoelasticity.

===Phase behavior===

====Crystallization and melting====

Depending on their chemical structures, polymers may be either semi-crystalline or amorphous. Semi-crystalline polymers can undergo crystallization and melting transitions, whereas amorphous polymers do not. In polymers, crystallization and melting do not suggest solid-liquid phase transitions, as in the case of water or other molecular fluids. Instead, crystallization and melting refer to the phase transitions between two solid states (&quot;i.e.&quot;, semi-crystalline and amorphous). Crystallization occurs above the glass-transition temperature (&quot;T&quot;g) and below the melting temperature (&quot;T&quot;m).

====Glass transition====
All polymers (amorphous or semi-crystalline) go through glass transitions. The glass-transition temperature (&quot;T&quot;g) is a crucial physical parameter for polymer manufacturing, processing, and use. Below &quot;T&quot;g, molecular motions are frozen and polymers are brittle and glassy. Above &quot;T&quot;g, molecular motions are activated and polymers are rubbery and viscous. The glass-transition temperature may be engineered by altering the degree of branching or crosslinking in the polymer or by the addition of plasticizers.

Whereas crystallization and melting are first-order phase transitions, the glass transition is not. The glass transition shares features of second-order phase transitions (such as discontinuity in the heat capacity, as shown in the figure), but it is generally not considered a thermodynamic transition between equilibrium states.

====Mixing behavior====

In general, polymeric mixtures are far less miscible than mixtures of small molecule materials. This effect results from the fact that the driving force for mixing is usually entropy, not interaction energy. In other words, miscible materials usually form a solution not because their interaction with each other is more favorable than their self-interaction, but because of an increase in entropy and hence free energy associated with increasing the amount of volume available to each component. This increase in entropy scales with the number of particles (or moles) being mixed. Since polymeric molecules are much larger and hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small molecules, the number of molecules involved in a polymeric mixture is far smaller than the number in a small molecule mixture of equal volume. The energetics of mixing, on the other hand, is comparable on a per volume basis for polymeric and small molecule mixtures. This tends to increase the free energy of mixing for polymer solutions and thereby making solvation less favorable, and thereby making the availability of concentrated solutions of polymers far rarer than those of small molecules.

Furthermore, the phase behavior of polymer solutions and mixtures is more complex than that of small molecule mixtures. Whereas most small molecule solutions exhibit only an upper critical solution temperature phase transition (UCST), at which phase separation occurs with cooling, polymer mixtures commonly exhibit a lower critical solution temperature phase transition (LCST), at which phase separation occurs with heating.

In dilute solutions, the properties of the polymer are characterized by the interaction between the solvent and the polymer. In a good solvent, the polymer appears swollen and occupies a large volume. In this scenario, intermolecular forces between the solvent and monomer subunits dominate over intramolecular interactions. In a bad solvent or poor solvent, intramolecular forces dominate and the chain contracts. In the theta solvent, or the state of the polymer solution where the value of the second virial coefficient becomes 0, the intermolecular polymer-solvent repulsion balances exactly the intramolecular monomer-monomer attraction. Under the theta condition (also called the Flory condition), the polymer behaves like an ideal random coil. The transition between the states is known as a coil–globule transition.

====Inclusion of plasticizers====
Inclusion of plasticizers tends to lower Tg and increase polymer flexibility. Addition of the plasticizer will also modify dependence of the glass-transition temperature Tg on the cooling rate. The mobility of the chain can further change if the molecules of plasticizer give rise to hydrogen bonding formation. Plasticizers are generally small molecules that are chemically similar to the polymer and create gaps between polymer chains for greater mobility and fewer interchain interactions. A good example of the action of plasticizers is related to polyvinylchlorides or PVCs. A uPVC, or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, is used for things such as pipes. A pipe has no plasticizers in it, because it needs to remain strong and heat-resistant. Plasticized PVC is used in clothing for a flexible quality. Plasticizers are also put in some types of cling film to make the polymer more flexible.

===Chemical properties===
The attractive forces between polymer chains play a large part in determining the polymer&#x27;s properties. Because polymer chains are so long, they have many such interchain interactions per molecule, amplifying the effect of these interactions on the polymer properties in comparison to attractions between conventional molecules. Different side groups on the polymer can lend the polymer to ionic bonding or hydrogen bonding between its own chains. These stronger forces typically result in higher tensile strength and higher crystalline melting points.

The intermolecular forces in polymers can be affected by dipoles in the monomer units. Polymers containing amide or carbonyl groups can form hydrogen bonds between adjacent chains; the partially positively charged hydrogen atoms in N-H groups of one chain are strongly attracted to the partially negatively charged oxygen atoms in C=O groups on another. These strong hydrogen bonds, for example, result in the high tensile strength and melting point of polymers containing urethane or urea linkages. Polyesters have dipole-dipole bonding between the oxygen atoms in C=O groups and the hydrogen atoms in H-C groups. Dipole bonding is not as strong as hydrogen bonding, so a polyester&#x27;s melting point and strength are lower than Kevlar&#x27;s (Twaron), but polyesters have greater flexibility. Polymers with non-polar units such as polyethylene interact only through weak Van der Waals forces. As a result, they typically have lower melting temperatures than other polymers.

When a polymer is dispersed or dissolved in a liquid, such as in commercial products like paints and glues, the chemical properties and molecular interactions influence how the solution flows and can even lead to self-assembly of the polymer into complex structures. When a polymer is applied as a coating, the chemical properties will influence the adhesion of the coating and how it interacts with external materials, such as superhydrophobic polymer coatings leading to water resistance. Overall the chemical properties of a polymer are important elements for designing new polymeric material products.

===Optical properties===
Polymers such as PMMA and HEMA:MMA are used as matrices in the gain medium of solid-state dye lasers, also known as solid-state dye-doped polymer lasers. These polymers have a high surface quality and are also highly transparent so that the laser properties are dominated by the laser dye used to dope the polymer matrix. These type of lasers, that also belong to the class of organic lasers, are known to yield very narrow linewidths which is useful for spectroscopy and analytical applications. An important optical parameter in the polymer used in laser applications is the change in refractive index with temperature
also known as dn/dT. For the polymers mentioned here the (dn/dT) ~ −1.4 × 10−4 in units of K−1 in the 297 ≤ T ≤ 337 K range.

===Electrical properties===
Most conventional polymers such as polyethylene are electrical insulators, but the development of polymers containing π-conjugated bonds has led to a wealth of polymer-based semiconductors, such as polythiophenes. This has led to many applications in the field of organic electronics.

==Applications==
Nowadays, synthetic polymers are used in almost all walks of life. Modern society would look very different without them. The spreading of polymer use is connected to their unique properties: low density, low cost, good thermal/electrical insulation properties, high resistance to corrosion, low-energy demanding polymer manufacture and facile processing into final products. For a given application, the properties of a polymer can be tuned or enhanced by combination with other materials, as in composites. Their application allows to save energy (lighter cars and planes, thermally insulated buildings), protect food and drinking water (packaging), save land and lower use of fertilizers (synthetic fibres), preserve other materials (coatings), protect and save lives (hygiene, medical applications). A representative, non-exhaustive list of applications is given below.

* Clothing, sportswear and accessories: polyester and PVC clothing, spandex, sport shoes, wetsuits, footballs and billiard balls, skis and snowboards, rackets, parachutes, sails, tents and shelters.
* Electronic and photonic technologies: organic field effect transistors (OFET), light emitting diodes (OLED) and solar cells, television components, compact discs (CD), photoresists, holography.
* Packaging and containers: films, bottles, food packaging, barrels.

* Construction and structural applications: garden furniture, PVC windows, flooring, sealing, pipes.
* Paints, glues and lubricants: varnish, adhesives, dispersants, anti-graffiti coatings, antifouling coatings, non-stick surfaces, lubricants.
* Car parts: tires, bumpers, windshields, windscreen wipers, fuel tanks, car seats.
* Household items: buckets, kitchenware, toys (e.g., construction sets and Rubik&#x27;s cube).

* Separation technologies: synthetic membranes, fuel cell membranes, filtration, ion-exchange resins.
* Money: polymer banknotes and payment cards.
* 3D printing.

==Standardized nomenclature==
There are multiple conventions for naming polymer substances. Many commonly used polymers, such as those found in consumer products, are referred to by a common or trivial name. The trivial name is assigned based on historical precedent or popular usage rather than a standardized naming convention. Both the American Chemical Society (ACS) and IUPAC have proposed standardized naming conventions; the ACS and IUPAC conventions are similar but not identical. Examples of the differences between the various naming conventions are given in the table below:

In both standardized conventions, the polymers&#x27; names are intended to reflect the monomer(s) from which they are synthesized (source based nomenclature) rather than the precise nature of the repeating subunit. For example, the polymer synthesized from the simple alkene ethene is called polyethene, retaining the &quot;-ene&quot; suffix even though the double bond is removed during the polymerization process:
However, IUPAC structure based nomenclature is based on naming of the preferred constitutional repeating unit.

IUPAC has also issued guidelines for abbreviating new polymer names. 138 common polymer abbreviations are also standardized in the standard ISO 1043-1.

==Characterization==

Polymer characterization spans many techniques for determining the chemical composition, molecular weight distribution, and physical properties. Select common techniques include the following:

*Size-exclusion chromatography (also called gel permeation chromatography), sometimes coupled with static light scattering, can used to determine the number-average molecular weight, weight-average molecular weight, and dispersity.
*Scattering techniques, such as static light scattering and small-angle neutron scattering, are used to determine the dimensions (radius of gyration) of macromolecules in solution or in the melt. These techniques are also used to characterize the three-dimensional structure of microphase-separated block polymers, polymeric micelles, and other materials.
*Wide-angle X-ray scattering (also called wide-angle X-ray diffraction) is used to determine the crystalline structure of polymers (or lack thereof).
*Spectroscopy techniques, including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, can be used to determine the chemical composition.
*Differential scanning calorimetry is used to characterize the thermal properties of polymers, such as the glass-transition temperature, crystallization temperature, and melting temperature. The glass-transition temperature can also be determined by dynamic mechanical analysis.
*Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer.
*Rheology is used to characterize the flow and deformation behavior. It can be used to determine the viscosity, modulus, and other rheological properties. Rheology is also often used to determine the molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, branching) and to understand how the polymer can be processed.

==Degradation==
Polymer degradation is a change in the properties—tensile strength, color, shape, or molecular weight—of a polymer or polymer-based product under the influence of one or more environmental factors, such as heat, light, and the presence of certain chemicals, oxygen, and enzymes. This change in properties is often the result of bond breaking in the polymer backbone (chain scission) which may occur at the chain ends or at random positions in the chain.

Although such changes are frequently undesirable, in some cases, such as biodegradation and recycling, they may be intended to prevent environmental pollution. Degradation can also be useful in biomedical settings. For example, a copolymer of polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid is employed in hydrolysable stitches that slowly degrade after they are applied to a wound.

The susceptibility of a polymer to degradation depends on its structure. Epoxies and chains containing aromatic functionalities are especially susceptible to UV degradation while polyesters are susceptible to degradation by hydrolysis. Polymers containing an unsaturated backbone degrade via ozone cracking. Carbon based polymers are more susceptible to thermal degradation than inorganic polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane and are therefore not ideal for most high-temperature applications.

The degradation of polyethylene occurs by random scission—a random breakage of the bonds that hold the atoms of the polymer together. When heated above 450 °C, polyethylene degrades to form a mixture of hydrocarbons. In the case of chain-end scission, monomers are released and this process is referred to as unzipping or depolymerization. Which mechanism dominates will depend on the type of polymer and temperature; in general, polymers with no or a single small substituent in the repeat unit will decompose via random-chain scission.

The sorting of polymer waste for recycling purposes may be facilitated by the use of the resin identification codes developed by the Society of the Plastics Industry to identify the type of plastic.

===Product failure===

Failure of safety-critical polymer components can cause serious accidents, such as fire in the case of cracked and degraded polymer fuel lines. Chlorine-induced cracking of acetal resin plumbing joints and polybutylene pipes has caused many serious floods in domestic properties, especially in the US in the 1990s. Traces of chlorine in the water supply attacked polymers present in the plumbing, a problem which occurs faster if any of the parts have been poorly extruded or injection molded. Attack of the acetal joint occurred because of faulty molding, leading to cracking along the threads of the fitting where there is stress concentration.

Polymer oxidation has caused accidents involving medical devices. One of the oldest known failure modes is ozone cracking caused by chain scission when ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers, such as natural rubber and nitrile rubber. They possess double bonds in their repeat units which are cleaved during ozonolysis. Cracks in fuel lines can penetrate the bore of the tube and cause fuel leakage. If cracking occurs in the engine compartment, electric sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire. In medical use degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical characteristics of implantable devices.

Nylon 66 is susceptible to acid hydrolysis, and in one accident, a fractured fuel line led to a spillage of diesel into the road. If diesel fuel leaks onto the road, accidents to following cars can be caused by the slippery nature of the deposit, which is like black ice. Furthermore, the asphalt concrete road surface will suffer damage as a result of the diesel fuel dissolving the asphaltenes from the composite material, this resulting in the degradation of the asphalt surface and structural integrity of the road.

== History ==
Polymers have been essential components of commodities since the early days of humankind. The use of wool (keratin), cotton and linen fibres (cellulose) for garments, paper reed (cellulose) for paper are just a few examples of how ancient societies exploited polymer-containing raw materials to obtain artefacts. The latex sap of &quot;caoutchouc&quot; trees (natural rubber) reached Europe in the 16th century from South America long after the Olmec, Maya and Aztec had started using it as a material to make balls, waterproof textiles and containers.

The chemical manipulation of polymers dates back to the 19th century, although at the time the nature of these species was not understood. The behaviour of polymers was initially rationalised according to the theory proposed by Thomas Graham which considered them as colloidal aggregates of small molecules held together by unknown forces.

Notwithstanding the lack of theoretical knowledge, the potential of polymers to provide innovative, accessible and cheap materials was immediately grasped. The work carried out by Braconnot, Parkes, Ludersdorf, Hayward and many others on the modification of natural polymers determined many significant advances in the field. Their contributions led to the discovery of materials such as celluloid, galalith, parkesine, rayon, vulcanised rubber and, later, Bakelite: all materials that quickly entered industrial manufacturing processes and reached households as garments components (&quot;e.g.&quot;, fabrics, buttons), crockery and decorative items.

In 1920, Hermann Staudinger published his seminal work &quot;Über Polymerisation&quot;, in which he proposed that polymers were in fact long chains of atoms linked by covalent bonds. His work was debated at length, but eventually it was accepted by the scientific community. Because of this work, Staudinger was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953.

After the 1930s polymers entered a golden age during which new types were discovered and quickly given commercial applications, replacing naturally-sourced materials. This development was fuelled by an industrial sector with a strong economic drive and it was supported by a broad academic community that contributed innovative syntheses of monomers from cheaper raw material, more efficient polymerisation processes, improved techniques for polymer characterisation and advanced, theoretical understanding of polymers.

Since 1953, six Nobel prizes have been awarded in the area of polymer science, excluding those for research on biological macromolecules. This further testifies to its impact on modern science and technology. As Lord Todd summarised in 1980, &quot;I am inclined to think that the development of polymerization is perhaps the biggest thing that chemistry has done, where it has had the biggest effect on everyday life&quot;.

<text>In economics, specifically general equilibrium theory, a perfect market, also known as an atomistic market, is defined by several idealizing conditions, collectively called perfect competition, or atomistic competition. In theoretical models where conditions of perfect competition hold, it has been demonstrated that a market will reach an equilibrium in which the quantity supplied for every product or service, including labor, equals the quantity demanded at the current price. This equilibrium would be a Pareto optimum.

Perfect competition provides both allocative efficiency and productive efficiency:
* Such markets are &quot;allocatively efficient&quot;, as output will always occur where marginal cost is equal to average revenue i.e. price (MC = AR). In perfect competition, any profit-maximizing producer faces a market price equal to its marginal cost (P = MC). This implies that a factor&#x27;s price equals the factor&#x27;s marginal revenue product. It allows for derivation of the supply curve on which the neoclassical approach is based. This is also the reason why a monopoly does not have a supply curve. The abandonment of price taking creates considerable difficulties for the demonstration of a general equilibrium except under other, very specific conditions such as that of monopolistic competition. 
* In the short-run, perfectly competitive markets are not necessarily &quot;productively efficient&quot;, as output will not always occur where marginal cost is equal to average cost (MC = AC). However, in the long-run, productive efficiency occurs as new firms enter the industry. Competition reduces price and cost to the minimum of the long run average costs. At this point, price equals both the marginal cost and the average total cost for each good (P = MC = AC).

The theory of perfect competition has its roots in late-19th century economic thought. Léon Walras gave the first rigorous definition of perfect competition and derived some of its main results. In the 1950s, the theory was further formalized by Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu.

Imperfect competition was a theory created to explain the more realistic kind of market interaction that lies in between perfect competition and a monopoly. Edward Chamberlin wrote &quot;Monopolistic Competition&quot; in 1933 as &quot;a challenge to the traditional viewpoint that competition and monopolies are alternatives and that individual prices are to be explained in either terms of one or the other&quot; (Dewey,88.) In this book, and for much of his career, he &quot;analyzed firms that do not produce identical goods, but goods that are close substitutes for one another&quot; (Sandmo,300.)

Another key player in understanding imperfect competition is Joan Robinson, who published her book &quot;The Economics of Imperfect Competition&quot; the same year Chamberlain published his. While Chamberlain focused much of his work on product development, Robinson focused heavily on price formation and discrimination (Sandmo,303.) The act of price discrimination under imperfect competition implies that the seller would sell their goods at different prices depending on the characteristic of the buyer to increase revenue (Robinson,204.) Joan Robinson and Edward Chamberlain came to many of the same conclusions regarding imperfect competition while still adding a bit of their twist to the theory. Despite their similarities or disagreements about who discovered the idea, both were extremely helpful in allowing firms to understand better how to center their goods around the wants of the consumer to achieve the highest amount of revenue possible.

Real markets are never perfect. Those economists who believe in perfect competition as a useful approximation to real markets may classify those as ranging from close-to-perfect to very imperfect. The real estate market is an example of a very imperfect market. In such markets, the theory of the second best proves that if one optimality condition in an economic model cannot be satisfied, it is possible that the next-best solution involves changing other variables away from the values that would otherwise be optimal.

In modern conditions, the theory of perfect competition has been modified from a quantitative assessment of competitors to a more natural atomic balance (equilibrium) in the market. There may be many competitors in the market, but if there is hidden collusion between them, the competition will not be maximally perfect. But if the principle of atomic balance operates in the market, then even between two equal forces perfect competition may arise. If we try to artificially increase the number of competitors and to reduce honest local big business to small size, we will open the way for unscrupulous monopolies from outside.

==Idealizing conditions of perfect competition==
There is a set of market conditions which are assumed to prevail in the discussion of what perfect competition might be if it were theoretically possible to ever obtain such perfect market conditions. These conditions include:

* A large number of sellers and buyers – A large number of consumers with the willingness and ability to buy the product at a certain price, and a large number of producers with the willingness and ability to supply the product at a certain price. As a result, individuals are unable to influence prices more than a little.
* Anti-competitive regulation: It is assumed that a market of perfect competition shall provide the regulations and protections implicit in the control of and elimination of anti-competitive activity in the market place.
* Every participant is a price taker: No participant with market power to set prices.
* Homogeneous products: The products are perfect substitutes for each other (i.e., the qualities and characteristics of a market good or service do not vary between different suppliers). There are many instances in which there exist &quot;similar&quot; products that are close substitutes (such as butter and margarine), which are relatively easily interchangeable, so that a rise in the price of one good will cause a significant shift to the consumption of the close substitute. If the cost of changing a firm&#x27;s manufacturing process to produce the substitute is also relatively &quot;immaterial&quot; in relationship to the firm&#x27;s overall profit and cost, this is sufficient to ensure that an economic situation isn&#x27;t significantly different from a perfectly competitive economic market. 
* Rational buyers: Buyers make all trades that increase their economic utility and make no trades that do not.
* No barriers to entry or exit: This implies that both entry and exit must be perfectly free of sunk costs.
* No externalities: Costs or benefits of an activity do not affect third parties. This criterion also excludes any government intervention.
* Non-increasing returns to scale and no network effects: The lack of economies of scale or network effects ensures that there will always be a sufficient number of firms in the industry.
* Perfect factor mobility: In the long run factors of production are perfectly mobile, allowing free long term adjustments to changing market conditions. This allows workers to freely move between firms.
* Perfect information: All consumers and producers know all prices of products and utilities they would get from owning each product. This prevents firms from obtaining any information which would give them a competitive edge.
* Profit maximization of sellers: Firms sell where the most profit is generated, where marginal costs meet marginal revenue.
* Well defined property rights: These determine what may be sold, as well as what rights are conferred on the buyer.
* Zero transaction costs: Buyers and sellers do not incur costs in making an exchange of goods.

== Normal profit ==
In a perfect market the sellers operate at zero economic surplus: sellers make a level of return on investment known as normal profits.

&quot;Normal&quot; profit is a component of (implicit) costs and not a component of business profit at all. It represents all the opportunity cost, as the time that the owner spends running the firm could be spent on running a different firm. The enterprise component of normal profit is thus the profit that a business owner considers necessary to make running the business worth while: that is, it is comparable to the next best amount the entrepreneur could earn doing another job. Particularly if enterprise is not included as a factor of production, it can also be viewed a return to capital for investors including the entrepreneur, equivalent to the return the capital owner could have expected (in a safe investment), plus compensation for risk. In other words, the cost of normal profit varies both within and across industries; it is commensurate with the riskiness associated with each type of investment, as per the risk–return spectrum.

In circumstances of perfect competition, only normal profits arise when the long run economic equilibrium is reached; there is no incentive for firms to either enter or leave the industry.

=== In competitive and contestable markets ===

Economic profit does not occur in perfect competition in long run equilibrium; if it did, there would be an incentive for new firms to enter the industry, aided by a lack of barriers to entry until there was no longer any economic profit. As new firms enter the industry, they increase the supply of the product available in the market, and these new firms are forced to charge a lower price to entice consumers to buy the additional supply these new firms are supplying as the firms all compete for customers (See &quot;Persistence&quot; in the &quot;Monopoly Profit&quot; discussion). Incumbent firms within the industry face losing their existing customers to the new firms entering the industry, and are therefore forced to lower their prices to match the lower prices set by the new firms. New firms will continue to enter the industry until the price of the product is lowered to the point that it is the same as the average cost of producing the product, and all of the economic profit disappears. When this happens, economic agents outside of the industry find no advantage to forming new firms that enter into the industry, the supply of the product stops increasing, and the price charged for the product stabilizes, settling into an equilibrium.

The same is likewise true of the long run equilibria of monopolistically competitive industries and, more generally, any market which is held to be contestable. Normally, a firm that introduces a differentiated product can initially secure a &quot;temporary&quot; market power for a &quot;short while&quot; (See &quot;Persistence&quot; in &quot;Monopoly Profit&quot;). At this stage, the initial price the consumer must pay for the product is high, and the demand for, as well as the availability of the product in the market, will be limited. In the long run, however, when the profitability of the product is well established, and because there are few barriers to entry, the number of firms that produce this product will increase until the available supply of the product eventually becomes relatively large, the price of the product shrinks down to the level of the average cost of producing the product. When this finally occurs, all monopoly profit associated with producing and selling the product disappears, and the initial monopoly turns into a competitive industry. In the case of contestable markets, the cycle is often ended with the departure of the former &quot;hit and run&quot; entrants to the market, returning the industry to its previous state, just with a lower price and no economic profit for the incumbent firms.

Profit can, however, occur in competitive and contestable markets in the short run, as firms jostle for market position. Once risk is accounted for, long-lasting economic profit in a competitive market is thus viewed as the result of constant cost-cutting and performance improvement ahead of industry competitors, allowing costs to be below the market-set price.

=== In non-competitive markets ===

Economic profit is, however, much more prevalent in uncompetitive markets such as in a perfect monopoly or oligopoly situation. In these scenarios, individual firms have some element of market power: Though monopolists are constrained by consumer demand, they are not price takers, but instead either price-setters or quantity setters. This allows the firm to set a price that is higher than that which would be found in a similar but more competitive industry, allowing them economic profit in both the long and short run.

The existence of economic profits depends on the prevalence of barriers to entry: these stop other firms from entering into the industry and sapping away profits, as they would in a more competitive market. In cases where barriers are present, but more than one firm, firms can collude to limit production, thereby restricting supply in order to ensure that the price of the product remains high enough for all firms in the industry to achieve an economic profit.

However, some economists, for instance Steve Keen, a professor at the University of Western Sydney, argue that even an infinitesimal amount of market power can allow a firm to produce a profit and that the absence of economic profit in an industry, or even merely that some production occurs at a loss, in and of itself constitutes a barrier to entry.

In a single-goods case, a positive economic profit happens when the firm&#x27;s average cost is less than the price of the product or service at the profit-maximizing output. The economic profit is equal to the quantity of output multiplied by the difference between the average cost and the price.

=== Government intervention ===
Often, governments will try to intervene in uncompetitive markets to make them more competitive. Antitrust (US) or competition (elsewhere) laws were created to prevent powerful firms from using their economic power to artificially create the barriers to entry they need to protect their economic profits. This includes the use of predatory pricing toward smaller competitors. For example, in the United States, Microsoft Corporation was initially convicted of breaking Anti-Trust Law and engaging in anti-competitive behavior in order to form one such barrier in &quot;United States v. Microsoft&quot;; after a successful appeal on technical grounds, Microsoft agreed to a settlement with the Department of Justice in which they were faced with stringent oversight procedures and explicit requirements designed to prevent this predatory behaviour. With lower barriers, new firms can enter the market again, making the long run equilibrium more like that of a competitive industry, with no economic profit for firms.

If a government feels it is impractical to have a competitive market – such as in the case of a natural monopoly – it will sometimes try to regulate the existing uncompetitive market by controlling the price firms charge for their product. For example, the old AT&amp;T (regulated) monopoly, which existed before the courts ordered its breakup, had to get government approval to raise its prices. The government examined the monopoly&#x27;s costs to determine whether the monopoly should be able raise its price, and could reject the monopoly&#x27;s application for a higher price if the cost did not justify it. Although a regulated firm will not have an economic profit as large as it would in an unregulated situation, it can still make profits well above a competitive firm in a truly competitive market.

==Results==


In a perfectly competitive market, the demand curve facing a firm is perfectly elastic.

As mentioned above, the perfect competition model, if interpreted as applying also to short-period or very-short-period behaviour, is approximated only by markets of homogeneous products produced and purchased by very many sellers and buyers, usually organized markets for agricultural products or raw materials. In real-world markets, assumptions such as perfect information cannot be verified and are only approximated in organized double-auction markets where most agents wait and observe the behaviour of prices before deciding to exchange (but in the long-period interpretation perfect information is not necessary, the analysis only aims at determining the average around which market prices gravitate, and for gravitation to operate one does not need perfect information).

In the absence of externalities and public goods, perfectly competitive equilibria are Pareto-efficient, i.e. no improvement in the utility of a consumer is possible without a worsening of the utility of some other consumer. This is called the First Theorem of Welfare Economics. The basic reason is that no productive factor with a non-zero marginal product is left unutilized, and the units of each factor are so allocated as to yield the same indirect marginal utility in all uses, a basic efficiency condition (if this indirect marginal utility were higher in one use than in other ones, a Pareto improvement could be achieved by transferring a small amount of the factor to the use where it yields a higher marginal utility).

A simple proof assuming differentiable utility functions and production functions is the following. Let formula_1 be the &#x27;price&#x27; (the rental) of a certain factor formula_2, let formula_3 and formula_4 be its marginal product in the production of goods formula_5 and formula_6, and let formula_7 and formula_8 be these goods&#x27; prices. In equilibrium these prices must equal the respective marginal costs formula_9 and formula_10; remember that marginal cost equals factor &#x27;price&#x27; divided by factor marginal productivity (because increasing the production of good by one very small unit through an increase of the employment of factor formula_2 requires increasing the factor employment by formula_12 and thus increasing the cost by formula_13, and through the condition of cost minimization that marginal products must be proportional to factor &#x27;prices&#x27; it can be shown that the cost increase is the same if the output increase is obtained by optimally varying all factors). Optimal factor employment by a price-taking firm requires equality of factor rental and factor marginal revenue product, formula_14, so we obtain formula_15, formula_16.

Now choose any consumer purchasing both goods, and measure his utility in such units that in equilibrium his marginal utility of money (the increase in utility due to the last unit of money spent on each good), formula_17, is 1. Then formula_18, formula_19. The indirect marginal utility of the factor is the increase in the utility of our consumer achieved by an increase in the employment of the factor by one (very small) unit; this increase in utility through allocating the small increase in factor utilization to good formula_5 is formula_21, and through allocating it to good formula_6 it is formula_23 again. With our choice of units the marginal utility of the amount of the factor consumed directly by the optimizing consumer is again w, so the amount supplied of the factor too satisfies the condition of optimal allocation.

Monopoly violates this optimal allocation condition, because in a monopolized industry market price is above marginal cost, and this means that factors are underutilized in the monopolized industry, they have a higher indirect marginal utility than in their uses in competitive industries. Of course, this theorem is considered irrelevant by economists who do not believe that general equilibrium theory correctly predicts the functioning of market economies; but it is given great importance by neoclassical economists and it is the theoretical reason given by them for combating monopolies and for antitrust legislation.

===Profit===
In contrast to a monopoly or oligopoly, in perfect competition it is impossible for a firm to earn economic profit in the long run, which is to say that a firm cannot make any more money than is necessary to cover its economic costs. In order not to misinterpret this zero-long-run-profits thesis, it must be remembered that the term &#x27;profit&#x27; is used in different ways: 
*Neoclassical theory defines profit as what is left of revenue after all costs have been subtracted; including normal interest on capital plus the normal excess over it required to cover risk, and normal salary for managerial activity. This means that profit is calculated after the actors are compensated for their opportunity costs.
*Classical economists on the contrary define profit as what is left after subtracting costs except interest and risk coverage. Thus, the classical approach does not account for opportunity costs.
Thus, if one leaves aside risk coverage for simplicity, the neoclassical zero-long-run-profit thesis would be re-expressed in classical parlance as profits coinciding with interest in the long period (i.e. the rate of profit tending to coincide with the rate of interest). Profits in the classical meaning do not necessarily disappear in the long period but tend to normal profit. 
With this terminology, if a firm is earning abnormal profit in the short term, this will act as a trigger for other firms to enter the market. As other firms enter the market, the market supply curve will shift out, causing prices to fall. Existing firms will react to this lower price by adjusting their capital stock downward. This adjustment will cause their marginal cost to shift to the left causing the market supply curve to shift inward. However, the net effect of entry by new firms and adjustment by existing firms will be to shift the supply curve outward. The market price will be driven down until all firms are earning normal profit only.

It is important to note that perfect competition is a sufficient condition for allocative and productive efficiency, but it is not a necessary condition. Laboratory experiments in which participants have significant price setting power and little or no information about their counterparts consistently produce efficient results given the proper trading institutions.

==Shutdown point==
In the short run, a firm operating at a loss [formula_24 (revenue less than total cost) or formula_25 (price less than unit cost)] must decide whether to continue to operate or temporarily shut down. The shutdown rule states &quot;in the short run a firm should continue to operate if price exceeds average variable costs&quot;. Restated, the rule is that for a firm to continue producing in the short run it must earn sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs. The rationale for the rule is straightforward: By shutting down a firm avoids all variable costs. However, the firm must still pay fixed costs. Because fixed costs must be paid regardless of whether a firm operates they should not be considered in deciding whether to produce or shut down. Thus in determining whether to shut down a firm should compare total revenue to total variable costs (formula_26) rather than total costs (formula_27). If the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its total variable cost (formula_28), then the firm is covering all variable costs and there is additional revenue (&quot;contribution&quot;), which can be applied to fixed costs. (The size of the fixed costs is irrelevant as it is a sunk cost. The same consideration is used whether fixed costs are one dollar or one million dollars.) On the other hand, if formula_29 then the firm is not covering its production costs and it should immediately shut down. The rule is conventionally stated in terms of price (average revenue) and average variable costs. The rules are equivalent (if one divides both sides of inequality formula_30 by formula_31 gives formula_32). If the firm decides to operate, the firm will continue to produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs because these conditions insure not only profit maximization (loss minimization) but also maximum contribution.

Another way to state the rule is that a firm should compare the profits from operating to those realized if it shut down and select the option that produces the greater profit. A firm that is shut down is generating zero revenue and incurring no variable costs. However, the firm still has to pay fixed cost. So the firm&#x27;s profit equals fixed costs or formula_33. An operating firm is generating revenue, incurring variable costs and paying fixed costs. The operating firm&#x27;s profit is formula_34. The firm should continue to operate if formula_35, which simplified is formula_36. The difference between revenue, formula_37, and variable costs, formula_26, is the contribution to fixed costs and any contribution is better than none. Thus, if formula_36 then firm should operate. If formula_40 the firm should shut down.

A decision to shut down means that the firm is temporarily suspending production. It does not mean that the firm is going out of business (exiting the industry). If market conditions improve, and prices increase, the firm can resume production. Shutting down is a short-run decision. A firm that has shut down is not producing. The firm still retains its capital assets; however, the firm cannot leave the industry or avoid its fixed costs in the short run. Exit is a long-term decision. A firm that has exited an industry has avoided all commitments and freed all capital for use in more profitable enterprises.

However, a firm cannot continue to incur losses indefinitely. In the long run, the firm will have to earn sufficient revenue to cover all its expenses and must decide whether to continue in business or to leave the industry and pursue profits elsewhere. The long-run decision is based on the relationship of the price and long-run average costs. If formula_41 then the firm will not exit the industry. If formula_42, then the firm will exit the industry. These comparisons will be made after the firm has made the necessary and feasible long-term adjustments. In the long run a firm operates where marginal revenue equals long-run marginal costs.

==Short-run supply curve==
The short-run (formula_43) supply curve for a perfectly competitive firm is the marginal cost (formula_44) curve at and above the shutdown point. Portions of the marginal cost curve below the shutdown point are not part of the formula_43 supply curve because the firm is not producing any positive quantity in that range. Technically the formula_43 supply curve is a discontinuous function composed of the segment of the formula_44 curve at and above minimum of the average variable cost curve and a segment that runs on the vertical axis from the origin to but not including a point at the height of the minimum average variable cost.

==Criticisms==
The use of the assumption of perfect competition as the foundation of price theory for product markets is often criticized as representing all agents as passive, thus removing the active attempts to increase one&#x27;s welfare or profits by price undercutting, product design, advertising, innovation, activities that – the critics argue – characterize most industries and markets. These criticisms point to the frequent lack of realism of the assumptions of product homogeneity and impossibility to differentiate it, but apart from this, the accusation of passivity appears correct only for short-period or very-short-period analyses, in long-period analyses the inability of price to diverge from the natural or long-period price is due to active reactions of entry or exit.

Some economists have a different kind of criticism concerning perfect competition model. They are not criticizing the price taker assumption because it makes economic agents too &quot;passive&quot;, but because it then raises the question of who sets the prices. Indeed, if everyone is price taker, there is the need for a benevolent planner who gives and sets the prices, in other word, there is a need for a &quot;price maker&quot;. Therefore, it makes the perfect competition model appropriate not to describe a decentralized &quot;market&quot; economy but a centralized one. This in turn means that such kind of model has more to do with communism than capitalism.

Another frequent criticism is that it is often not true that in the short run differences between supply and demand cause changes in price; especially in manufacturing, the more common behaviour is alteration of production without nearly any alteration of price.

The critics of the assumption of perfect competition in product markets seldom question the basic neoclassical view of the working of market economies for this reason. The Austrian School insists strongly on this criticism, and yet the neoclassical view of the working of market economies as fundamentally efficient, reflecting consumer choices and assigning to each agent his contribution to social welfare, is esteemed to be fundamentally correct. Some non-neoclassical schools, like Post-Keynesians, reject the neoclassical approach to value and distribution, but not because of their rejection of perfect competition as a reasonable approximation to the working of most product markets; the reasons for rejection of the neoclassical &#x27;vision&#x27; are different views of the determinants of income distribution and of aggregated demand.

In particular, the rejection of perfect competition does not generally entail the rejection of free competition as characterizing most product markets; indeed it has been argued that competition is stronger nowadays than in 19th century capitalism, owing to the increasing capacity of big conglomerate firms to enter any industry: therefore the classical idea of a tendency toward a uniform rate of return on investment in all industries owing to free entry is even more valid today; and the reason why General Motors, Exxon or Nestlé do not enter the computers or pharmaceutical industries is not insurmountable barriers to entry but rather that the rate of return in the latter industries is already sufficiently in line with the average rate of return elsewhere as not to justify entry. On this few economists, it would seem, would disagree, even among the neoclassical ones. Thus when the issue is normal, or long-period, product prices, differences on the validity of the perfect competition assumption do not appear to imply important differences on the existence or not of a tendency of rates of return toward uniformity as long as entry is possible, and what is found fundamentally lacking in the perfect competition model is the absence of marketing expenses and innovation as causes of costs that do enter normal average cost.

The issue is different with respect to factor markets. Here the acceptance or denial of perfect competition in labour markets does make a big difference to the view of the working of market economies. One must distinguish neoclassical from non-neoclassical economists. For the former, absence of perfect competition in labour markets, e.g. due to the existence of trade unions, impedes the smooth working of competition, which if left free to operate would cause a decrease of wages as long as there were unemployment, and would finally ensure the full employment of labour: labour unemployment is due to absence of perfect competition in labour markets. Most non-neoclassical economists deny that a full flexibility of wages would ensure the full employment of labour and find a stickiness of wages an indispensable component of a market economy, without which the economy would lack the regularity and persistence indispensable to its smooth working. This was, for example, John Maynard Keynes&#x27;s opinion.

Particularly radical is the view of the Sraffian school on this issue: the labour demand curve cannot be determined hence a level of wages ensuring the equality between supply and demand for labour does not exist, and economics should resume the viewpoint of the classical economists, according to whom competition in labour markets does not and cannot mean indefinite price flexibility as long as supply and demand are unequal, it only means a tendency to equality of wages for similar work, but the level of wages is necessarily determined by complex sociopolitical elements; custom, feelings of justice, informal allegiances to classes, as well as overt coalitions such as trade unions, far from being impediments to a smooth working of labour markets that would be able to determine wages even without these elements, are on the contrary indispensable because without them there would be no way to determine wages.

==Equilibrium in perfect competition==

Equilibrium in perfect competition is the point where market demands will be equal to market supply. A firm&#x27;s price will be determined at this point. In the short run, equilibrium will be affected by demand. In the long run, both demand and supply of a product will affect the equilibrium in perfect competition. A firm will receive only normal profit in the long run at the equilibrium point.

As it is well known, requirements for a firm&#x27;s cost-curve under perfect competition is for the slope to move upwards after a certain amount is produced. This amount is small enough to leave a sufficiently large number of firms in the field (for any given total outputs in the industry) for the conditions of perfect competition to be preserved. For the short-run, the supply of some factors are assumed to be fixed and as the price of the other factors are given, costs per unit must necessarily rise after a certain point. From a theoretical point of view, given the assumptions that there will be a tendency for continuous growth in size for firms, long-period static equilibrium alongside perfect competition may be incompatible.

<text>Philosophy of religion is &quot;the philosophical examination of the central themes and concepts involved in religious traditions&quot;. Philosophical discussions on such topics date from ancient times, and appear in the earliest known texts concerning philosophy. The field involves many other branches of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, logic, ethics, aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science.

The philosophy of religion differs from religious philosophy in that it seeks to discuss questions regarding the nature of religion as a whole, rather than examining the problems brought forth by a particular belief-system. The philosophy of religion differs from theology in that it aims to examine religious concepts from an objective philosophical perspective rather than from the perspective of a specific religious tradition. The philosophy of religion also differs from religious studies in that it seeks to evaluate the truth of religious worldviews. It can be carried out dispassionately by those who identify as believers or non-believers.

==Overview==

Philosopher William L. Rowe characterized the philosophy of religion as: &quot;the critical examination of basic religious beliefs and concepts.&quot; Philosophy of religion covers alternative beliefs about God, gods, demons, spirits or all, the varieties of religious experience, the interplay between science and religion, the nature and scope of good and evil, and religious treatments of birth, history, and death. The field also includes the ethical implications of religious commitments, the relation between faith, reason, experience and tradition, concepts of the miraculous, the sacred revelation, mysticism, power, and salvation.

The term &quot;philosophy of religion&quot; did not come into general use in the West until the nineteenth century, and most pre-modern and early modern philosophical works included a mixture of religious themes and non-religious philosophical questions. In Asia, examples include texts such as the Hindu Upanishads, the works of Daoism and Confucianism and Buddhist texts. Greek philosophies like Pythagoreanism and Stoicism included religious elements and theories about deities, and Medieval philosophy was strongly influenced by the big three monotheistic Abrahamic religions. In the Western world, early modern philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and George Berkeley discussed religious topics alongside secular philosophical issues as well.

The philosophy of religion has been distinguished from theology by pointing out that, for theology, &quot;its critical reflections are based on religious convictions&quot;. Also, &quot;theology is responsible to an authority that initiates its thinking, speaking, and witnessing ... [while] philosophy bases its arguments on the ground of timeless evidence.&quot;

Some aspects of philosophy of religion have classically been regarded as a part of metaphysics. In Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, the necessarily prior cause of eternal motion was an unmoved mover, who, like the object of desire, or of thought, inspires motion without itself being moved. Today, however, philosophers have adopted the term &quot;philosophy of religion&quot; for the subject, and typically it is regarded as a separate field of specialization, although it is also still treated by some, particularly Catholic philosophers, as a part of metaphysics.

==Basic themes and problems==
=== Ultimate reality ===
Different religions have different ideas about ultimate reality, its source or ground (or lack thereof) and also about what is the &quot;Maximal Greatness&quot;. Paul Tillich&#x27;s concept of &#x27;Ultimate Concern&#x27; and Rudolf Otto&#x27;s &#x27;Idea of the Holy&#x27; are concepts which point to concerns about the ultimate or highest truth which most religious philosophies deal with in some way. One of the main differences among religions is whether the ultimate reality is a personal god or an impersonal reality.

In Western religions, various forms of theism are the most common conceptions, while in Eastern religions, there are theistic and also various non-theistic conceptions of the Ultimate. Theistic vs non-theistic is a common way of sorting the different types of religions.

There are also several philosophical positions with regard to the existence of God that one might take including various forms of theism (such as monotheism and polytheism), agnosticism and different forms of atheism.

====Monotheism====

Keith Yandell outlines roughly three kinds of historical monotheisms: Greek, Semitic and Hindu. Greek monotheism holds that the world has always existed and does not believe in creationism or divine providence, while Semitic monotheism believes the world was created by a God at a particular point in time and that this God acts in the world. Indian monotheism teaches that the world is beginningless, but that there is God&#x27;s act of creation which sustains the world.

The attempt to provide proofs or arguments for the existence of God is one aspect of what is known as natural theology or the natural theistic project. This strand of natural theology attempts to justify belief in God by independent grounds. Perhaps most of the philosophy of religion is predicated on natural theology&#x27;s assumption that the existence of God can be justified or warranted on rational grounds. There has been considerable philosophical and theological debate about the kinds of proofs, justifications and arguments that are appropriate for this discourse.

====Non-theistic conceptions====
Eastern religions have included both theistic and other alternative positions about the ultimate nature of reality. One such view is Jainism, which holds a dualistic view that all that exists is matter and a multiplicity of souls (&quot;jiva&quot;), without depending on a supreme deity for their existence. There are also different Buddhist views, such as the Theravada Abhidharma view, which holds that the only ultimately existing things are transitory phenomenal events (&quot;dharmas&quot;) and their interdependent relations. Madhyamaka Buddhists such as Nagarjuna hold that ultimate reality is emptiness (&quot;shunyata&quot;) while the Yogacara holds that it is &quot;vijñapti&quot; (mental phenomena). In Indian philosophical discourses, monotheism was defended by Hindu philosophers (particularly the Nyaya school), while Buddhist thinkers argued against their conception of a creator god (Sanskrit: Ishvara).

The Hindu view of Advaita Vedanta, as defended by Adi Shankara, is a total non-dualism. Although Advaitins do believe in the usual Hindu gods, their view of ultimate reality is a radically monistic oneness (Brahman without qualities) and anything which appears (like persons and gods) is illusory (&quot;maya&quot;).

The various philosophical positions of Taoism can also be viewed as non-theistic about the ultimate reality (Tao). Taoist philosophers have conceived of different ways of describing the ultimate nature of things. For example, while the Taoist Xuanxue thinker Wang Bi argued that everything is &quot;rooted&quot; in&quot;Wu&quot; (non-being, nothingness), Guo Xiang rejected &quot;Wu&quot; as the ultimate source of things, instead arguing that the ultimate nature of the Tao is &quot;spontaneous self-production&quot; (&quot;zi sheng&quot;) and &quot;spontaneous self-transformation&quot; (&quot;zi hua&quot;).

Traditionally, Jains and Buddhists did not rule out the existence of limited deities or divine beings, they only rejected the idea of a single all-powerful creator God or First cause posited by monotheists.

===Knowledge and belief===
All religious traditions make knowledge claims which they argue are central to religious practice and to the ultimate solution to the main problem of human life. These include epistemic, metaphysical and ethical claims.

Evidentialism is the position that may be characterized as &quot;a belief is rationally justified only if there is sufficient evidence for it&quot;. Many theists and non-theists are evidentialists, for example, Aquinas and Bertrand Russell agree that belief in God is rational only if there is sufficient evidence, but disagree on whether such evidence exists. These arguments often stipulate that subjective religious experiences are not reasonable evidence and thus religious truths must be argued based on non-religious evidence. One of the strongest positions of evidentialism is that by William Kingdon Clifford who wrote: &quot;It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence&quot;. His view of evidentialism is usually read in tandem with William James&#x27;s article &quot;A Will to Believe&quot; (1896), which argues against Clifford&#x27;s principle. More recent supporters of evidentialism include Antony Flew (&quot;The Presumption of Atheism&quot;, 1972) and Michael Scriven (Primary philosophy, 1966). Both of them rely on the Ockhamist view that in the absence of evidence for X, belief in X is not justified. Many modern Thomists are also evidentialists in that they hold they can demonstrate there is evidence for the belief in God. Another move is to argue in a Bayesian way for the probability of a religious truth like God, not for total conclusive evidence.

Some philosophers, however, argue that religious belief is warranted &quot;without evidence&quot; and hence are sometimes called &quot;non-evidentialists&quot;. They include fideists and reformed epistemologists. Alvin Plantinga and other reformed epistemologists are examples of philosophers who argue that religious beliefs are &quot;properly basic beliefs&quot; and that it is not irrational to hold them even though they are not supported by any evidence. The rationale here is that some beliefs we hold must be foundational and not be based on further rational beliefs. If this is not so, then we risk an infinite regress. This is qualified by the proviso that they can be defended against objections (this differentiates this view from fideism). A properly basic belief is a belief that one can reasonably hold without evidence, such as a memory, a basic sensation or a perception. Plantinga&#x27;s argument is that belief in God is of this type because within every human mind there is a natural awareness of divinity.

William James in his essay &quot;The Will to Believe&quot; argues for a pragmatic conception of religious belief. For James, religious belief is justified if one is presented with a question which is rationally undecidable and if one is presented with genuine and live options which are relevant for the individual. For James, religious belief is defensible because of the pragmatic value it can bring to one&#x27;s life, even if there is no rational evidence for it.

Some work in recent epistemology of religion goes beyond debates over evidentialism, fideism, and reformed epistemology to consider contemporary issues deriving from new ideas about knowledge-how and practical skill; how practical factors can affect whether one could know whether theism is true; from formal epistemology&#x27;s use of probability theory; or from social epistemology (particularly the epistemology of testimony, or the epistemology of disagreement).

For example, an important topic in the epistemology of religion is that of religious disagreement, and the issue of what it means for intelligent individuals of the same epistemic parity to disagree about religious issues. Religious disagreement has been seen as possibly posing first-order or higher-order problems for religious belief. A first order problem refers to whether that evidence directly applies to the truth of any religious proposition, while a higher order problem instead applies to &quot;whether one has rationally assessed&quot; the first order evidence. One example of a first order problem is the Argument from nonbelief. Higher order discussions focus on whether religious disagreement with epistemic peers (someone whose epistemic ability is equal to our own) demands us to adopt a skeptical or agnostic stance or whether to reduce or change our religious beliefs.

===Faith and reason===
While religions resort to rational arguments to attempt to establish their views, they also claim that religious belief is at least partially to be accepted through faith, confidence or trust in one&#x27;s religious belief. There are different conceptions or models of faith, including:

*The affective model of faith sees it as a feeling of trust, a psychological state
*The special knowledge model of faith as revealing specific religious truths (defended by Reformed epistemology)
*The belief model of faith as the theoretical conviction that a certain religious claim is true.
*Faith as trusting, as making a fiducial commitment such as trusting in God.
*The practical doxastic venture model where faith is seen as a commitment to believe in the trustworthiness of a religious truth or in God. In other words, to trust in God presupposes belief, thus faith must include elements of belief and trust.
*The non-doxastic venture model of faith as practical commitment &quot;without actual belief&quot; (defended by figures such as Robert Audi, J. L. Schellenberg and Don Cupitt). In this view, one need not believe in literal religious claims about reality to have religious faith. 
*The hope model, faith as hoping

There are also different positions on how faith relates to reason. One example is the belief that faith and reason are compatible and work together, which is the view of Thomas Aquinas and the orthodox view of Catholic natural theology. According to this view, reason establishes certain religious truths and faith (guided by reason) gives us access to truths about the divine which, according to Aquinas, &quot;exceed all the ability of human reason.&quot;

Another position on is Fideism, the view that faith is &quot;in some sense independent of, if not outright adversarial toward, reason.&quot; Modern philosophers such as Kierkegaard, William James, and Wittgenstein have been associated with this label. Kierkegaard in particular, argued for the necessity of the religious to take a non-rational leap of faith to bridge the gulf between man and God. Wittgensteinian fideism meanwhile sees religious language games as being incommensurate with scientific and metaphysical language games, and that they are autonomous and thus may only be judged on their own standards. The obvious criticism to this is that many religions clearly put forth metaphysical claims.

Several contemporary New Atheist writers which are hostile to religion hold a related view that says that religious claims and scientific claims are opposed to each other and that therefore religions are false.

The Protestant theologian Karl Barth (1886–1968) argued that religious believers have no need to prove their beliefs through reason and thus rejected the project of natural theology. According to Barth, human reason is corrupt and God is utterly different from his creatures, thus we can only rely on God&#x27;s own revelation for religious knowledge. Barth&#x27;s view has been termed Neo-orthodoxy. Similarly, D.Z. Phillips argues that God is not intelligible through reason or evidence because God is not an empirical object or a &#x27;being among beings&#x27;.

As Brian Davies points out, the problem with positions like Barth&#x27;s is that they do not help us in deciding between inconsistent and competing revelations of the different religions.

===Science===
The topic of whether religious beliefs are compatible with science and in what way is also another important topic in the philosophy of religion as well as in theology. This field draws the historical study of their interactions and conflicts, such as the debates in the United States over the teaching of evolution and creationism. There are different models of interaction that have been discussed in the philosophical literature, including:

*Conflict thesis which sees them as being in constant conflict, such as during the reception of the theory of evolution and the current debate over creationism.
*Independence model, both have separate domains, or non-overlapping magisteria
*Dialogue model, some overlap between the fields, they remain separate but share some concepts and presuppositions
*Integration or unification model includes projects like natural theology and process theology

The field also draws the scientific study of religion, particularly by psychologists and sociologists as well as cognitive scientists. Various theories about religion have arisen from these various disciplines. One example is the various evolutionary theories of religion which see the phenomenon as either adaptive or a by-product. Another can be seen in the various theories put forth by the Cognitive science of religion. Some argued that evolutionary or cognitive theories undermine religious belief.

===Religious experience===
Closely related to knowledge and belief is how to interpret religious experiences and their potential for providing knowledge. Religious experiences have been recorded throughout all cultures and are widely diverse. These personal experiences tend to be highly important to individuals who undergo them. Discussions about religious experiences can be said to be informed in part by the question: &quot;what sort of information about what there is might religious experience provide, and how could one tell?&quot;

One could interpret these experiences either veridically, neutrally or as delusions. Both monotheistic and non-monotheistic religious thinkers and mystics have appealed to religious experiences as evidence for their claims about ultimate reality. Philosophers such as Richard Swinburne and William Alston have compared religious experiences to everyday perceptions, that is, both are noetic and have a perceptual object, and thus religious experiences could logically be veridical unless we have a good reason to disbelieve them. Other philosophers such as Eleonore Stump and Matthew Benton argue for an interpersonal epistemology on which one can experience and know God in a relational or personal sense.

According to Brian Davies common objections against the veridical force of religious experiences include the fact that experience is frequently deceptive and that people who claim an experience of a god may be &quot;mistakenly identifying an object of their experience&quot;, or be insane or hallucinating. However, he argues that we cannot deduce from the fact that our experiences are &quot;sometimes&quot; mistaken, hallucinations or distorted to the conclusion that all religious experiences are mistaken etc. Indeed, a drunken or hallucinating person could still perceive things correctly, therefore these objections cannot be said to &quot;necessarily&quot; disprove all religious experiences.

According to C. B. Martin, &quot;there are no tests agreed upon to establish genuine experience of God and distinguish it decisively from the ungenuine&quot;, and therefore all that religious experiences can establish is the reality of these psychological states.

Naturalistic explanations for religious experiences are often seen as undermining their epistemic value. Explanations such as the fear of death, suggestion, infantile regression, sexual frustration, neurological anomalies (&quot;it&#x27;s all in the head&quot;) as well as the socio-political power that having such experiences might grant to a mystic have been put forward. More recently, some argued that religious experiences are caused by cognitive misattributions akin to hallucinations, although this was denied by others. A contrary position was taken by Bertrand Russell who compared the veridical value of religious experiences to the hallucinations of a drunk person: &quot;From a scientific point of view, we can make no distinction between the man who eats little and sees heaven and the man who drinks much and sees snakes. Each is in an abnormal physical condition, and therefore has abnormal perceptions.&quot; However, as William L. Rowe notes:

The hidden assumption in Russell&#x27;s argument is that bodily and mental states that interfere with reliable perceptions of the physical world also interfere with reliable perceptions of a spiritual world beyond the physical, if there is such a spiritual world to be perceived. Perhaps this assumption is reasonable, but it certainly is not obviously true.

In other words, as argued by C.D. Broad, &quot;one might need to be slightly &#x27;cracked or at least appear to be mentally and physically abnormal in order to perceive the supranormal spiritual world.

William James meanwhile takes a middle course between accepting mystical experiences as veridical or seeing them as delusional. He argues that for the individual who experiences them, they are authoritative and they break down the authority of the rational mind. Not only that, but according to James, the mystic is justified in this. But when it comes to the non-mystic, the outside observer, they have no reason to regard them as either veridical nor delusive.

The study of religious experiences from the perspective of the field of phenomenology has also been a feature of the philosophy of religion. Key thinkers in this field include William Brede Kristensen and Gerard van der Leeuw.

====Types====

Just like there are different religions, there are different forms of religious experience. One could have &quot;subject/content&quot; experiences (such as a euphoric meditative state) and &quot;subject/consciousness/object&quot; experiences (such as the perception of having seen a god, i.e. theophany). Experiences of theophany are described in ancient Mediterranean religious works and myths and include the story of Semele who died due to her seeing Zeus and the Biblical story of the Burning bush. Indian texts like the Bhagavad Gita also contain theophanic events. The diversity (sometimes to the point of contradiction) of religious experiences has also been used as an argument against their veridical nature, and as evidence that they are a purely subjective psychological phenomenon.

In Western thought, religious experience (mainly a theistic one) has been described by the likes of Friedrich Schleiermacher, Rudolf Otto and William James. According to Schleiermacher, the distinguishing feature of a religious experience is that &quot;one is overcome by the feeling of absolute dependence.&quot; Otto meanwhile, argued that while this was an important element, the most basic feature of religious experiences is that it is &quot;numinous&quot;. He described this as &quot;non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self&quot; as well as having the qualities of being a mystery, terrifying and fascinating.

Rowe meanwhile defined a religious experience as &quot;an experience in which one senses the immediate presence of the divine.&quot; According to Rowe, religious experiences can be divided in the following manner:

*Religious experiences in which one senses the presence of the divine as being distinct from oneself.
*Mystical experiences in which one senses one&#x27;s own union with a divine presence.
**The extrovertive way looks outward through the senses into the world around us and finds the divine reality there.
**The introvertive way turns inward and finds the divine reality in the deepest part of the self.

Non-monotheistic religions meanwhile also report different experiences from theophany, such as non-dual experiences of oneness and deeply focused meditative states (termed &quot;samadhi&quot; in Indian religion) as well as experiences of enlightenment in Buddhism, liberation in Hinduism, and kevala in Jainism.

Another typology, offered by Chad Meister, differentiates between three major experiences:

*Regenerative experiences, in which an individual feels reborn, transformed or changed radically, usually resulting in religious conversion.
*Charismatic experiences, in which special gifts, abilities, or blessings are manifested (such as healing, visions, etc.)
*Mystical experiences, which can be described using William James qualifications as being: ineffable, noetic, transient and passive.

====Perennialism vs Constructivism====
Another debate on this topic is whether all religious cultures share common core mystical experiences (Perennialism) or whether these experiences are in some way socially and culturally constructed (Constructivism or Contextualism). According to Walter Stace all cultures share mystical experiences of oneness with the external world, as well as introverted &quot;Pure Conscious Events&quot; which is empty of all concepts, thoughts, qualities, etc. except pure consciousness. Similarly Ninian Smart argued that monistic experiences were universal. Perennialists tend to distinguish between the experience itself, and its post experience interpretation to make sense of the different views in world religions.

Some constructivists like Steven T. Katz meanwhile have argued against the common core thesis, and for either the view that every mystical experience contains at least some concepts (soft constructivism) or that they are strongly shaped and determined by one&#x27;s religious ideas and culture (hard constructivism). In this view, the conceptual scheme of any mystic strongly shapes their experiences and because mystics from different religions have very different schemas, there cannot be any universal mystical experiences.

===Religion and ethics===

All religions argue for certain values and ideas of the moral Good. Non-monotheistic Indian traditions like Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta find the highest Good in nirvana or moksha which leads to release from suffering and the rounds of rebirth and morality is a means to achieve this, while for monotheistic traditions, God is the source or ground of all morality and heaven in the highest human good. The world religions also offer different conceptions of the source of evil and suffering in the world, that is, what is wrong with human life and how to solve and free ourselves from these dilemmas. For example, for Christianity, sin is the source of human problems, while for Buddhism, it is craving and ignorance.

A general question which philosophy of religion asks is what is the relationship, if any, between morality and religion. Brian Davies outlines four possible theses:

*Morality somehow requires religion. One example of this view is Kant&#x27;s idea that morality should lead us to believe in a moral law, and thus to believe in an upholder of that law, that is, God.
*Morality is somehow included in religion, &quot;The basic idea here is that being moral is part of what being religious means.&quot; 
*Morality is pointless without religion, for one would have no reason to be moral without it.
*Morality and religion are opposed to each other. In this view, belief in a God would mean one would do whatever that God commands, even if it goes against morality. The view that religion and morality are often opposed has been espoused by atheists like Lucretius and Bertrand Russell as well as by theologians like Kierkegaard who argued for a &#x27;teleological suspension of the ethical&#x27;.

Monotheistic religions who seek to explain morality and its relationship to God must deal with what is termed the Euthyphro dilemma, famously stated in the Platonic dialogue &quot;Euthyphro&quot; as: &quot;Is the pious (τὸ ὅσιον, i.e. what is morally good) loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?&quot; Those who hold that what is moral is so &quot;because&quot; it is what God commands are defending a version of the Divine command theory.

Another important topic which is widely discussed in Abrahamic monotheistic religious philosophy is the problem of human Free will and God&#x27;s omniscience. God&#x27;s omniscience could presumably include perfect knowledge of the future, leading to Theological determinism and thus possibly contradicting with human free will. There are different positions on this including libertarianism (free will is true) and Predestination.

===Miracles===

Belief in miracles and supernatural events or occurrences is common among world religions. A miracle is an event which cannot be explained by rational or scientific means. The Resurrection of Jesus and the Miracles of Muhammad are examples of miracles claimed by religions.

Skepticism towards the supernatural can be found in early philosophical traditions like the Indian Carvaka school and Greco-Roman philosophers like Lucretius. David Hume, who defined a miracle as &quot;a violation of the laws of nature&quot;, famously argued against miracles in Of Miracles, Section X of &quot;An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1748). For Hume, the probability that a miracle has not occurred is always greater than the probability that it has because &quot;as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws [of nature], the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined&quot; (&quot;Enquiry&quot;. X. p. 173). Hume does not argue that a miracle is impossible, only that it is unreasonable to believe in any testimony of a miracle&#x27;s occurrence, for evidence for the regularity of natural laws is much stronger than human testimony (which is often in error).

According to Rowe, there are two weaknesses with Hume&#x27;s argument. First, there could be other forms of indirect evidence for the occurrence of a miracle that does not include testimony of someone&#x27;s direct experience of it. Secondly, Rowe argues that Hume overestimates &quot;the weight that should be given to past experience in support of some principle thought to be a law of nature.&quot; For it is a common occurrence that currently accepted ideas of natural laws are revised due to an observed exception but Hume&#x27;s argument would lead one to conclude that these exceptions do not occur. Rowe adds that &quot;It remains true, however, that a reasonable person will require quite strong evidence before believing that a law of nature has been violated. It is easy to believe the person who claimed to see water run downhill, but quite difficult to believe that someone saw water run uphill.&quot;

Another definition of a miracle is possible however, which is termed the Epistemic theory of miracles and was argued for by Spinoza and St. Augustine. This view rejects that a miracle is a transgression of natural laws, but is simply a transgression of our current &quot;understanding&quot; of natural law. In the &quot;Tractatus Theologico-Politicus&quot;, Spinoza writes: &quot;miracles are only intelligible as in relation to human opinions, and merely mean events of which the natural cause cannot be explained by a reference to any ordinary occurrence, either by us, or at any rate, by the writer and narrator of the miracle&quot; (&quot;Tractatus&quot; p. 84). Similarly, R.F. Holland has defined miracle in a naturalistic way in a widely cited paper. For Holland, a miracle need only be an extraordinary and beneficial coincidence interpreted religiously.

Brian Davies notes that even if we can establish that a miracle has occurred, it is hard to see what this is supposed to prove. For it is possible that they arise due to agencies which are unusual and powerful, but not divine.

===Afterlife===

World religions put forth various theories which affirm life after death and different kinds of postmortem existence. This is often tied to belief in an immortal individual soul or self (Sanskrit: atman) separate from the body which survives death, as defended by Plato, Descartes, Monotheistic religions like Christianity and many Indian philosophers. This view is also a position on the mind body problem, mainly, dualism. This view then must show not only that dualism is true and that souls exist, but also that souls survive death. As Kant famously argued, the mere existence of a soul does not prove its immortality, for one could conceive that a soul, even if it is totally simple, could still fade away or lose its intensity. H. H. Price is one modern philosopher who has speculated at length about what it would be like to be a disembodied soul after death.

One major issue with soul beliefs is that since personhood is closely tied to one&#x27;s physical body, it seems difficult to make sense of a human being existing apart from their body. A further issue is with continuity of personal identity, that is, it is not easy to account for the claim that the person that exists after bodily death is the &quot;same&quot; person that existed before.

Bertrand Russell put forth the general scientific argument against the afterlife as follows:

Persons are part of the everyday world with which science is concerned, and the conditions which determine their existence are discoverable...we know that the brain is not immortal, and that the organized energy of a living body becomes, as it were, demobilized at death and therefore not available for collective action. All the evidence goes to show that what we regard as our mental life is bound up with brain structure and organized bodily energy. Therefore it is rational to suppose that mental life ceases when bodily life ceases. The argument is only one of probability, but it is as strong as those upon which most scientific conclusions are based.

Contra Russell, J. M. E. McTaggart argues that people have no scientific proof that the mind is dependent on the body in this particular way. As Rowe notes, the fact that the mind depends on the functions of the body while one is alive is not necessarily proof that the mind will cease functioning after death just as a person trapped in a room while depending on the windows to see the outside world might continue to see even after the room ceases to exist.

Buddhism is one religion which, while affirming postmortem existence (through rebirth), denies the existence of individual souls and instead affirms a deflationary view of personal identity, termed &quot;not-self&quot; (anatta).

While physicalism has generally been seen as hostile to notions of an afterlife, this need not be the case. Abrahamic religions like Christianity have traditionally held that life after death will include the element of bodily resurrection. One objection to this view is that it seems difficult to account for personal continuity, at best, a resurrected body is a replica of the resurrected person not the same person. One response is the constitution view of persons, which says persons are constituted by their bodies and by a &quot;first-person perspective&quot;, the capacity to think of oneself &quot;as oneself&quot;. In this view, what is resurrected is that first person perspective, or both the person&#x27;s body and that perspective. An objection to this view is that it seems difficult to differentiate one person&#x27;s first person perspective from another person&#x27;s without reference to temporal and spatial relations. Peter van Inwagen meanwhile, offers the following theory:

Perhaps at the moment of each man&#x27;s death, God removes his corpse and replaces it with a simulacrum which is what is burned or rots. Or perhaps God is not quite so wholesale as this: perhaps He removes for &quot;safekeeping&quot; only the &quot;core person&quot;—the brain and central nervous system—or even some special part of it. These are details. (van Inwagen 1992: 245–46)

This view shows how some positions on the nature of the afterlife are closely tied to and sometimes completely depend upon theistic positions. This close connection between the two views was made by Kant, who argued that one can infer an afterlife from belief in a just God who rewards persons for their adherence to moral law.

Other discussions on the philosophy of the afterlife deal with phenomena such as near death experiences, reincarnation research, and other parapsychological events and hinge on whether naturalistic explanations for these phenomena is enough to explain them or not. Such discussions are associated with philosophers like William James, Henry Sidgwick, C.D. Broad, and H.H. Price.

===Diversity and pluralism===
The issue of how one is to understand religious diversity and the plurality of religious views and beliefs has been a central concern of the philosophy of religion.

There are various philosophical positions regarding how one is to make sense of religious diversity, including exclusivism, inclusivism, pluralism, relativism, atheism or antireligion and agnosticism.

Religious exclusivism is the claim that only one religion is true and that others are wrong. To say that a religion is exclusivistic can also mean that salvation or human freedom is only attainable by the followers of one&#x27;s religion. This view tends to be the orthodox view of most monotheistic religions, such as Christianity and Islam, though liberal and modernist trends within them might differ. The philosopher William L Rowe outlines two problems with this view. The first problem is that it is easy to see that if this is true, a large portion of humanity is excluded from salvation and it is hard to see how a loving god would desire this. The second problem is that once we become acquainted with the saintly figures and virtuous people in other religions, it can be difficult to see how we could say they are excluded from salvation just because they are not part of our religion.

A different view is inclusivism, which is the idea that &quot;one&#x27;s own tradition alone has the whole truth but that this truth is nevertheless partially reflected in other traditions.&quot; An inclusivist might maintain that their religion is privileged, they can also hold that other religious adherents have fundamental truths and even that they will be saved or liberated. The Jain view of Anekantavada (&#x27;many-sidedness&#x27;) has been interpreted by some as a tolerant view which is an inclusive acceptance of the partial truth value of non-Jain religious ideas. As Paul Dundas notes, the Jains ultimately held the thesis that Jainism is the final truth, while other religions only contain partial truths. Other scholars such as Kristin Beise Kiblinger have also argued that some of the Buddhist traditions include inclusivist ideas and attitudes.

In the modern Western study of religion, the work of Ninian Smart has also been instrumental in representing a more diverse understanding of religion and religious pluralism. Smart&#x27;s view is that there are genuine differences between religions.

Pluralism is the view that all religions are equally valid responses to the divine and that they are all valid paths to personal transformation. This approach is taken by John Hick, who has developed a pluralistic view which synthesizes components of various religious traditions. Hick promotes an idea of a noumenal sacred reality which different religions provide us access to. Hick defines his view as &quot;the great world faiths embody different perceptions and conceptions of, and correspondingly different responses to, the Real or the Ultimate.&quot; For Hick, all religions are true because they all allow us to encounter the divine reality, even if they have different deities and conceptions of it. Rowe notes that a similar idea is proposed by Paul Tillich&#x27;s concept of &quot;Being-itself&quot;.

The view of perennialism is that there is a single or core truth or experience which is shared by all religions even while they use different terms and language to express it. This view is espoused by the likes of Aldous Huxley, the thinkers of the Traditionalist School as well as Neo-Vedanta.

Yet another way of responding to the conflicting truth claims of religions is Relativism. Joseph Runzo., one of its most prominent defenders, has argued for &quot;henofideism&quot; which states that the truth of a religious worldview is relative to each community of adherents. Thus while religions have incompatible views, each one is individually valid as they emerge from individual experiences of a plurality of phenomenal divine realities. According to Runzo, this view does not reduce the incompatible ideas and experiences of different religions to mere interpretations of the Real and thus preserves their individual dignity.

Another response to the diversity and plurality of religious beliefs and deities throughout human history is one of skepticism towards all of them (or even antireligion), seeing them as illusions or human creations which serve human psychological needs. Sigmund Freud was a famous proponent of this view, in various publications such as &quot;The Future of an Illusion&quot; (1927) and &quot;Civilization and Its Discontents&quot; (1930). According to Freud, &quot;Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires.&quot;

While one can be skeptical towards the claims of religion, one need not be hostile towards religion. Don Cupitt is one example of someone who, while disbelieving in the metaphysical and cosmological claims of his religion, holds that one can practice it with a &quot;non-realist&quot; perspective which sees religious claims as human inventions and myths to live by.

===Religious language===

The question of religious language and in what sense it can be said to be meaningful has been a central issue of the philosophy of religion since the work of the Vienna circle, a group of philosophers who, influenced by Wittgenstein, put forth the theory of Logical positivism. Their view was that religious language, such as any talk of God cannot be verified empirically and thus was ultimately meaningless. This position has also been termed theological noncognitivism. A similar view can be seen in David Hume&#x27;s An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, where he famously wrote that any work which did not include either (1) abstract reasoning on quantity or number or (2) reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence was &quot;nothing but sophistry and illusion&quot;.

In a similar vein, Antony Flew, questioned the validity of religious statements because they do not seem to be falsifiable, that is, religious claims do not seem to allow any counter evidence to count against them and thus they seem to be lacking in content. While such arguments were popular in the 1950s and 60s, the verification principle and falsifiability as a criterion for meaning are no longer as widely held. The main problem with verificationism is that it seems to be self refuting, for it is a claim which does not seem to be supported by its own criterion.

As noted by Brian Davies, when talking about God and religious truths, religious traditions tend to resort to metaphor, negation and analogy. The via negativa has been defended by thinkers such as Maimonides who denied that positive statements about God were helpful and wrote: &quot;you will come nearer to the knowledge and comprehension of God by the negative attributes.&quot; Similar approaches based on negation can be seen in the Hindu doctrine of Neti neti and the Buddhist philosophy of Madhyamaka.

Wittgenstein&#x27;s theory of language games also shows how one can use analogical religious language to describe God or religious truths, even if the words one is using do not in this case refer to their everyday sense, i.e. when we say God is wise, we do not mean he is wise in the same sense that a person is wise, yet it can still make sense to talk in this manner. However, as Patrick Sherry notes, the fact that this sort of language may make sense does not mean that one is warranted in ascribing these terms to God, for there must be some connection between the relevant criteria we use in ascribing these terms to conventional objects or subjects and to God. As Chad Meister notes though, for Wittgenstein, a religion&#x27;s language game need not reflect some literal picture of reality (as a picture theory of meaning would hold) but is useful simply because its ability to &quot;reflect the practices and forms of life of the various religious adherents.&quot; Following Wittgenstein, philosophers of religion like Norman Malcolm, B. R. Tilghman, and D. Z. Phillips have argued that instead of seeing religious language as referring to some objective reality, we should instead see it as referring to &quot;forms of life&quot;. This approach is generally termed non-realist.

Against this view, realists respond that non-realism subverts religious belief and the intelligibility of religious practice. It is hard to see for example, how one can pray to a God without believing that they really exist. Realists also argue that non-realism provides no normative way to choose between competing religions.

==Analytic philosophy of religion==

In &quot;Analytic Philosophy of Religion&quot;, James Franklin Harris noted that
As with the study of ethics, early analytic philosophy tended to avoid the study of philosophy of religion, largely dismissing (as per the logical positivists view) the subject as part of metaphysics and therefore meaningless. The collapse of logical positivism renewed interest in philosophy of religion, prompting philosophers like William Alston, John Mackie, Alvin Plantinga, Robert Merrihew Adams, Richard Swinburne, and Antony Flew not only to introduce new problems, but to re-open classical topics such as the nature of miracles, theistic arguments, the problem of evil, the rationality of belief in God, concepts of the nature of God, and many more.

Plantinga, Mackie and Flew debated the logical validity of the &quot;free will defense&quot; as a way to solve the problem of evil. Alston, grappling with the consequences of analytic philosophy of language, worked on the nature of religious language. Adams worked on the relationship of faith and morality. Analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for a number of philosophically-sophisticated theistic arguments, like those of the reformed epistemologists like Plantinga.

Analytic philosophy of religion has also been preoccupied with Ludwig Wittgenstein, as well as his interpretation of Søren Kierkegaard&#x27;s philosophy of religion. Using first-hand remarks (which would later be published in &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;, &quot;Culture and Value&quot;, and other works), philosophers such as Peter Winch and Norman Malcolm developed what has come to be known as &quot;contemplative philosophy&quot;, a Wittgensteinian school of thought rooted in the &quot;Swansea tradition&quot; and which includes Wittgensteinians such as Rush Rhees, Peter Winch and D. Z. Phillips, among others. The name &quot;contemplative philosophy&quot; was first coined by D. Z. Phillips in &quot;Philosophy&#x27;s Cool Place&quot;, which rests on an interpretation of a passage from Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Culture and Value&quot;. This interpretation was first labeled, &quot;Wittgensteinian Fideism&quot;, by Kai Nielsen but those who consider themselves Wittgensteinians in the Swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal as a caricature of Wittgenstein&#x27;s considered position; this is especially true of D. Z. Phillips. Responding to this interpretation, Kai Nielsen and D.Z. Phillips became two of the most prominent philosophers on Wittgenstein&#x27;s philosophy of religion.

<doc id="23004" wikidata="Q665141" url="?curid=23004" title="Precedent">
<text>Precedent is a judicial decision that serves as an authority for courts when deciding subsequent identical or similar cases. Fundamental to common law legal systems, precedent operates under the principle of &quot;stare decisis&quot; (&quot;to stand by things decided&quot;), where past judicial decisions serve as case law to guide future rulings, thus promoting consistency and predictability.

Precedent is a defining feature that sets common law systems apart from civil law systems. In common law, precedent can either be something courts must follow (binding) or something they can consider but do not have to follow (persuasive). Civil law systems, in contrast, are characterized by comprehensive codes and detailed statutes, with no emphasis on precedent, and where judges primarily focus on fact-finding and applying codified law.

Courts in common law systems rely heavily on case law, which refers to the collection of precedents and legal principles established by previous judicial decisions on specific issues or topics. The development of case law depends on the systematic publication and indexing of these decisions in law reports, making them accessible to lawyers, courts, and the general public.

Generally speaking, a legal precedent may be:

* applied (if precedent is binding) / adopted (if precedent is persuasive), if the principles underpinning the previous decision are accordingly used to evaluate the issues of the subsequent case; 
* [[Distinguishing|distinguished]], if the principles underpinning the previous decision are found specific to, or premised upon, certain factual scenarios, and not applied to the subsequent case because of the absence or material difference in the latter&#x27;s facts; 
* modified, if the same court on determination of the same case on order from a higher court modified one or more parts of the previous decision; or
* overruled, if the same or higher courts on appeal or determination of subsequent cases found the principles underpinning the previous decision erroneous in law or overtaken by new legislation or developments.

==Principles==

=== &quot;Stare decisis&quot; ===
&quot;Stare decisis&quot; () is a judicial doctrine under which courts follow the principles, rules, or standards established in their prior decisions (or those of higher courts) when deciding cases involving the same or closely related issues. The term originates from the Latin phrase &quot;stare decisis et non quieta movere,&quot; meaning to &quot;stand by the thing decided and do not disturb the calm.&quot; 

The doctrine operates both horizontally and vertically. Vertical &quot;stare decisis&quot; binds lower courts to strictly follow the decisions of higher courts within the same jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals applying a precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court is an example of vertical &quot;stare decisis&quot;. Horizontal &quot;stare decisis&quot; refers the principle that a court adheres to its own previous rulings.

In the modern era, the U.S. Supreme Court adheres to its prior decisions unless there is a &lt;q&gt;special justification&lt;/q&gt; to overrule precedent. By taking this approach, the Court has rejected a strict view of &quot;stare decisis&quot; that would require it to uphold past rulings regardless of their merits or the practical consequences of maintaining or overturning them.

=== &quot;Ratio decidendi&quot; and &quot;obiter dicta&quot; ===
&quot;Ratio decidendi&quot; (&quot;the reason for the decision&quot;) refers to the key factual element or line of reasoning in a case that forms the basis for the court&#x27;s final judgment. It forms the basis for a court decision and creates binding precedent. This distinguishes it from other parts of a judicial opinion, such as &quot;obiter dicta&quot; (non-binding observations or comments).

In contrast, &quot;Obiter dictum|obiter dicta&quot; (“something said in passing”) refers to comments, suggestions, or observations made by a judge in an opinion that are not necessary to resolve the case at hand. While not legally binding on other courts, such statements may be cited as persuasive authority in subsequent litigation.

=== Hierarchy of courts ===

==== Federalism and parallel state and federal courts ====
In federal systems the division between federal and state law may result in complex interactions. In the United States, state courts are not considered inferior to federal courts but rather constitute a parallel court system.

* When a federal court rules on an issue of state law, the federal court must follow the precedent of the state courts, under the Erie doctrine. If an issue of state law arises during a case in federal court, and there is no decision on point from the highest court of the state, the federal court must either attempt to predict how the state courts would resolve the issue by looking at decisions from state appellate courts, or, if allowed by the constitution of the relevant state, submit the question to the state&#x27;s courts.
* On the other hand, when a state court rules on an issue of federal law, the state court is bound only by rulings of the Supreme Court, but not by decisions of federal district or circuit courts of appeals. However, some states have adopted a practice of considering themselves bound by rulings of the court of appeals embracing their states, as a matter of comity rather than constitutional obligation.

In practice, however, judges in one system will almost always choose to follow relevant case law in the other system to prevent divergent results and to minimize forum shopping.

==Types of precedent==
===Binding precedent===
Binding precedent, based on the legal principle of &quot;stare decisis,&quot; requires lower courts to follow the decisions of appellate courts in the same jurisdiction. In other words, when an appellate court resolves a question of law, its determination, or &quot;holding,&quot; serves as precedent that lower courts are bound to apply in cases involving similar facts or legal issues.

For example, in the United States, decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, as the nation&#x27;s highest court, are binding on all other courts nationwide. 

===Persuasive precedent===

Persuasive precedent refers to legal decisions that a court may consider but is not obligated to follow when deciding a case, as they are not binding. Examples include decisions from courts in neighboring jurisdictions and &quot;dicta&quot; from rulings by higher courts. In Australia, decisions of superior overseas courts, such as those from the United Kingdom, serve as persuasive precedent.

Although not binding precedent, a court may choose to rely on persuasive precedent if the reasoning is compelling. Courts often turn to decisions from other jurisdictions for guidance, particularly when interpreting unclear laws or addressing &quot;cases of first impression&quot;—situations in which no prior binding authority exists and the court must determine the applicable law for the first time.

===Nonprecedential decisions===
Nonpublication of opinions, or unpublished opinions, are those decisions of courts that are not available for citation as precedent because the judges making the opinion deem the cases as having less precedential value. Selective publication is the legal process which a judge or justices of a court decide whether a decision is to be or not published in a reporter. &quot;Unpublished&quot; federal appellate decisions are published in the Federal Appendix. Depublication is the power of a court to make a previously published order or opinion unpublished.

Litigation that is settled out of court generates no written decision, thus has no precedential effect. As one practical effect, the U.S. Department of Justice settles many cases against the federal government simply to avoid creating adverse precedent.

==Precedent in civil law and mixed systems ==

===Civil law systems===

&quot;Stare decisis&quot; is not usually a doctrine used in civil law systems, because it violates the legislative positivist principle that only the legislature may make law. Instead, the civil law system relies on the doctrine of &quot;jurisprudence constante&quot;, according to which if a court has adjudicated a consistent line of cases that arrive at the same holdings using sound reasoning, then the previous decisions are highly persuasive but not controlling on issues of law. This doctrine is similar to &quot;stare decisis&quot; insofar as it dictates that a court&#x27;s decision must condone a cohesive and predictable result. In theory, lower courts are generally not bound by the precedents of higher courts. In practice, the need for predictability means that lower courts generally defer to the precedent of higher courts. As a result, the precedent of courts of last resort, such as the French Cassation Court and the Council of State, is recognized as being &quot;de facto&quot; binding on lower courts.

The doctrine of &quot;jurisprudence constante&quot; also influences how court decisions are structured. In general, court decisions of common law jurisdictions give a sufficient &quot;ratio decidendi&quot; as to guide future courts. The ratio is used to justify a court decision on the basis of previous case law as well as to make it easier to use the decision as a precedent for future cases. By contrast, court decisions in some civil law jurisdictions (most prominently France) tend to be extremely brief, mentioning only the relevant legislation and codal provisions and not going into the &quot;ratio decidendi&quot; in any great detail. This is the result of the legislative positivist view that the court is only interpreting the legislature&#x27;s intent and therefore detailed exposition is unnecessary. Because of this, &quot;ratio decidendi&quot; is carried out by legal academics (doctrinal writers) who provide the explanations that in common law jurisdictions would be provided by the judges themselves.

In other civil law jurisdictions, such as the German-speaking countries, &quot;ratio decidendi&quot; tend to be much more developed than in France, and courts will frequently cite previous cases and doctrinal writers. However, some courts (such as German courts) have less emphasis on the particular facts of the case than common law courts, but have more emphasis on the discussion of various doctrinal arguments and on finding what the correct interpretation of the law is.

The mixed systems of the Nordic countries are sometimes considered a branch of the civil law, but they are sometimes counted as separate from the civil law tradition. In Sweden, for instance, case law arguably plays a more important role than in some of the continental civil law systems. The two highest courts, the Supreme Court (&quot;Högsta domstolen&quot;) and the Supreme Administrative Court (&quot;Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen&quot;), have the right to set precedent which has persuasive authority on all future application of the law. Appellate courts, be they judicial (&quot;hovrätter&quot;) or administrative (&quot;kammarrätter&quot;), may also issue decisions that act as guides for the application of the law, but these decisions are persuasive, not controlling, and may therefore be overturned by higher courts.

===Mixed or bijuridical systems===

Some mixed systems, such as Scots law in Scotland, South African law, Laws of the Philippines, and the law of Quebec and Louisiana, do not fit into the civil vs. common law dichotomy because they mix portions of both. Such systems may have been heavily influenced by the common law tradition; however, their private law is firmly rooted in the civil law tradition. Because of their position between the two main systems of law, these types of legal systems are sometimes referred to as &quot;mixed&quot; systems of law. Louisiana courts, for instance, operate under both &quot;stare decisis&quot; and &quot;jurisprudence constante&quot;. In South Africa, the precedent of higher courts is absolutely or fully binding on lower courts, whereas the precedent of lower courts only has persuasive authority on higher courts; horizontally, precedent is &quot;prima facie&quot; or presumptively binding between courts.

===Role of academics in civil law jurisdictions===

Law professors in common law traditions play a much smaller role in developing case law than professors in civil law traditions. Because court decisions in civil law traditions are brief and not amenable to establishing precedent, much of the exposition of the law in civil law traditions is done by academics rather than by judges; this is called doctrine and may be published in treatises or in journals such as &quot;Recueil Dalloz&quot; in France. Historically, common law courts relied little on legal scholarship; thus, at the turn of the twentieth century, it was very rare to see an academic writer quoted in a legal decision (except perhaps for the academic writings of prominent judges such as Coke and Blackstone). Today academic writers are often cited in legal argument and decisions as persuasive authority; often, they are cited when judges are attempting to implement reasoning that other courts have not yet adopted, or when the judge believes the academic&#x27;s restatement of the law is more compelling than can be found in precedent. Thus common law systems are adopting one of the approaches long common in civil law jurisdictions.

==Critical analysis==

===Court formulations===

Justice Louis Brandeis, in a heavily footnoted dissent to &quot;Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.&quot;, , 405–411 (1932), explained (citations and quotations omitted):

In his &quot;landmark dissent&quot; in &quot;Burnet&quot;, Brandeis &quot;catalogued the Court&#x27;s actual overruling practices in such a powerful manner that his attendant stare decisis analysis immediately assumed canonical authority.&quot;

The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated:

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated:

Lord Hodge of the UK Supreme Court quoted Lord Wright in 1938 saying:

===Academic study===
Precedent viewed against passing time can serve to establish trends, thus indicating the next logical step in evolving interpretations of the law. For instance, if immigration has become more and more restricted under the law, then the next legal decision on that subject may serve to restrict it further still. The existence of submerged precedent (reasoned opinions not made available through conventional legal research sources) has been identified as a potentially distorting force in the evolution of law.

Scholars have recently attempted to apply network theory to precedent in order to establish which precedent is most important or authoritative, and how the court&#x27;s interpretations and priorities have changed over time.

==Application==

===Development===
Early English common law did not have or require the &quot;stare decisis&quot; doctrine for a range of legal and technological reasons:
*During the formative period of the common law, the royal courts constituted only one among many fora in which in the English could settle their disputes. The royal courts operated alongside and in competition with ecclesiastic, manorial, urban, mercantile, and local courts.
*Royal courts were not organised into a hierarchy; instead, different royal courts (exchequer, common pleas, king&#x27;s bench, and chancery) were in competition with each other.
*Substantial law on almost all matters was neither legislated nor codified, eliminating the need for courts to interpret legislation.
*Common law&#x27;s main distinctive features and focus were not substantial law, which was customary law, but procedural.
*The practice of citing previous cases was not to find binding legal rules but as evidence of custom.
*Customary law was not a rational and consistent body of rules and did not require a system of binding precedent.
*Before the printing press, the state of the written records of cases rendered the &quot;stare decisis&quot; doctrine utterly impracticable.

These features changed over time, opening the door to the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot;:
===United States legal system===

Over time courts in the United States and especially its Supreme Court developed a large body of judicial decisions which are called &quot;precedents&quot;. These &quot;[r]ules and principles established in prior cases inform the Court&#x27;s future decisions.&quot; The adherence to rules and principles created in past cases as a foundation for future decisions by the courts is called &quot;stare decisis&quot;. The United States Supreme Court considers stare decisis not only as an important doctrine, but also &quot;the means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion.&quot; &quot;Stare decisis&quot; aims to bolster the legitimacy of the judicial process and foster the rule of law. It does so by strengthening stability, certainty, predictability, consistency and uniformity in the application of the law to cases and litigants. By adhering to &quot;stare decisis&quot; the Supreme Court attempts to preserve its role &quot;as a careful, unbiased, and predictable decisionmaker that decides cases according to the law rather than the Justices&#x27; individual policy preferences.&quot; In &quot;Vasquez v. Hillery&quot; (1986) the Supreme Court stated succinctly that stare decisis &quot;contributes to the integrity of our constitutional system of government, both in appearance and in fact&quot; by maintaining the notion &quot;that bedrock principles are founded in the law, rather than in the proclivities of individuals.&quot;

&quot;Stare decisis&quot; reduces the number and scope of legal questions that the court must resolve in litigation. It is therefore a time saver for judges and litigants. Once a court has settled a particular question of law it has established a precedent. Thanks to &quot;stare decisis&quot; lawsuits can be quickly and efficiently dismissed because legal battles can be resolved through recourse to rules and principles established prior decisions. &quot;Stare decisis&quot; can thus encourage parties to settle cases out of court and thereby enhance judicial efficiency.

Several Supreme Court decisions were overruled by subsequent decisions since 1798. In doing so the Supreme Court has time and time again made several statements regarding stare decisis. The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of these statements:

* &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;, 558 U.S. 310, at 378 (2010) (Roberts, J., concurring): &quot;[Stare decisis&#x27;] greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal—the rule of law. It follows that in the unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more damage to this constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that precedent.&quot; (citations omitted)
* &quot;Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey&quot;, 505 U.S. 833, at 854 (1992): &quot;[T]he very concept of the rule of law underlying our own Constitution requires such continuity over time that a respect for precedent is, by definition, indispensable.&quot; (citations omitted)
* &quot;Alleyne v. United States&quot;, 570 U.S. 99, 118 (2013) (Sotomayor, J., concurring): &quot;We generally adhere to our prior decisions, even if we questions their soundness, because doing so &#x27;promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process&#x27;.&quot;
* &quot;Hilton v. South Carolina Public. Railway Commission&quot;, 502 U.S. 197, at 202 (1991): &quot;Adherence to precedent promotes stability, predictability, and respect for judicial authority.&quot;
* &quot;Payne v. Tennessee&quot;, 501 U.S. 808, at 827 (1991): &quot;Stare decisis is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.&quot;
* &quot;Vasquez v. Hillery&quot;, 474 U.S. 254, at 265-66 (1986): &quot;[T]he important doctrine of stare decisis [is] the means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion. That doctrine permits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law, rather than in the proclivities of individuals, and thereby contributes to the integrity of our constitutional system of government, both in appearance and in fact.&quot;
* &quot;Taylor v. Sturgell&quot;, 553 U.S. 880, at 903 (2008): &quot;&quot;[S]tare decisis&quot; will allow courts swiftly to dispose of repetitive suits ...&quot;
* &quot;Payne v. Tennessee&quot;, 501 U.S. 808, at 834 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring): &quot;What would enshrine power as the governing principle of this Court is the notion that an important constitutional decision with plainly inadequate rational support must be left in place for the sole reason that it once attracted a [majority of the Court].&quot;
* &quot;Patterson v. McLean Credit Union&quot;, 491 U.S. 164, at 172 (1989): &quot;Our precedents are not sacrosanct, for we have overruled prior decisions where the necessity and propriety of doing so has been established.&quot;
* &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot;, 321 U.S. 649, at 665 (1944): &quot;[W]hen convinced of former error, this Court has never felt constrained to follow precedents. In constitutional questions, where correction depends upon amendment and not upon legislative action this Court throughout its history has freely exercised its power to reexamine the basis of its constitutional decisions.&quot;
* &quot;Janus v. Am. Fed. of State, County, &amp; Mun. Employees&quot;, 585 U.S. ___, No. 16-1466, slip op. at 34 (2018): &quot;We will not overturn a past decision unless there are strong grounds for doing so.&quot;
* &quot;Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey&quot;, 505 U.S. 833, at 864 (1992) (plurality opinion): &quot;[A] decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided.&quot; The plurality opinion in &quot;Casey&quot; stated also that reexamining precedent requires more than &quot;a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently&quot;.
* &quot; Arizona v. Rumsey&quot;, 467 U.S. 203, at 212 (1984): &quot;Although adherence to precedent is not rigidly required in constitutional cases, any departure from the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot; demands special justification.&quot;

&quot;Stare decisis&quot; applies to the holding of a case, rather than to obiter dicta (&quot;things said by the way&quot;). As the United States Supreme Court has put it: &quot;dicta may be followed if sufficiently persuasive but are not binding&quot;.

In the U.S. Supreme Court, the principle of stare decisis is most flexible in constitutional cases, as observed by Justice Brandeis in his landmark dissent in &quot;Burnet&quot; (as quoted at length above). For example, in the years 1946–1992, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in about 130 cases. The U.S. Supreme Court has further explained as follows:

The Court has stated that where a court gives multiple reasons for a given result, each alternative reason that is &quot;explicitly&quot; labeled by the court as an &quot;independent&quot; ground for the decision is not treated as &quot;simply a dictum&quot;.

As Colin Starger has pointed out, the contemporary rule of stare decisis descended from Brandeis&#x27;s landmark dissent in &quot;Burnet&quot; would later split into strong and weak conceptions as a result of the disagreement between Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall in &quot;Payne v. Tennessee&quot; (1991). The strong conception requires a &quot;special justification&quot; to overrule challenged precedent beyond the fact the precedent was &quot;wrongly decided&quot;, while the weak conception holds that a precedent can be overruled if it suffers from &quot;bad reasoning&quot;.

The opinion of Chief Justice John Roberts in the case &quot;June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo&quot; provides a clear statement of the strong conception of &quot;stare decisis&quot;. In this case, the Court upheld, by a 5–4 margin, their 2016 decision in &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot; that struck down a similar Texas law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have the right to admit patients at a nearby hospital. Roberts wrote, &quot;The legal doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot; requires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike.&quot; Roberts provided the fifth vote to uphold the 2016 decision, even though he felt it was wrongly decided.

===English legal system===
The doctrine of binding precedent or &quot;stare decisis&quot; is basic to the English legal system. Special features of the English legal system include the following:

====The Supreme Court&#x27;s ability to override its own precedent ====
The British House of Lords, as the court of last appeal outside Scotland before it was replaced by the UK Supreme Court, was not strictly bound to always follow its own decisions until the case &quot;London Street Tramways v London County Council&quot; [1898] AC 375. After this case, once the Lords had given a ruling on a point of law, the matter was closed unless and until Parliament made a change by statute. This is the most strict form of the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot; (one not applied, previously, in common law jurisdictions, where there was somewhat greater flexibility for a court of last resort to review its own precedent).

This situation changed, however, after the House of Lords issued the Practice Statement of 1966. The House of Lords decided to allow itself to adapt English law to meet changing social conditions. In &quot;R v G&quot; [2003] UKHL 50, the House of Lords overruled its 1981 decision in &quot;R v Caldwell&quot;, which had allowed the Lords to establish mens rea (&quot;guilty mind&quot;) by measuring a defendant&#x27;s conduct against that of a &quot;reasonable person&quot;, regardless of the defendant&#x27;s actual state of mind.

However, the Practice Statement was seldom applied by the House of Lords, usually only as a last resort. Up to 2005, the House of Lords rejected its past decisions no more than 20 times. They were reluctant to use it because they feared to introduce uncertainty into the law. In particular, the Practice Statement stated that the Lords would be especially reluctant to overrule themselves in criminal cases because of the importance of certainty of that law. The first case involving criminal law to be overruled with the Practice Statement was &quot;Anderton v Ryan&quot; (1985), which was overruled by &quot;R v Shivpuri&quot; (1986), two decades after the Practice Statement. Remarkably, the precedent overruled had been made only a year before, but it had been criticised by several academic lawyers. As a result, Lord Bridge stated he was &quot;undeterred by the consideration that the decision in &quot;Anderton v Ryan&quot; was so recent. The Practice Statement is an effective abandonment of our pretension to infallibility. If a serious error embodied in a decision of this House has distorted the law, the sooner it is corrected the better.&quot; Still, the House of Lords has remained reluctant to overrule itself in some cases; in &quot;R v Kansal&quot; (2002), the majority of House members adopted the opinion that &quot;R v Lambert&quot; had been wrongly decided and agreed to depart from their earlier decision.

====Distinguishing precedent on legal (rather than fact) grounds====
A precedent does not bind a court if it finds there was a lack of care in the original &quot;Per Incuriam&quot;. For example, if a statutory provision or precedent had not been brought to the previous court&#x27;s attention before its decision, the precedent would not be binding.

==Rules of statutory interpretation==
One of the most important roles of precedent is to resolve ambiguities in other legal texts, such as constitutions, statutes, and regulations. The process involves, first and foremost, consultation of the plain language of the text, as enlightened by the legislative history of enactment, subsequent precedent, and experience with various interpretations of similar texts.

===Statutory interpretation in the UK===
A judge&#x27;s normal aids include access to all previous cases in which a precedent has been set, and a good English dictionary.

Judges and barristers in the UK use three primary rules for interpreting the law.

Under the literal rule, the judge should do what the actual legislation states rather than trying to do what the judge thinks that it means. The judge should use the plain everyday ordinary meaning of the words, even if this produces an unjust or undesirable outcome. A good example of problems with this method is &quot;R v Maginnis&quot; (1987), in which several judges in separate opinions found several different dictionary meanings of the word &quot;supply&quot;. Another example is &quot;Fisher v Bell&quot;, where it was held that a shopkeeper who placed an illegal item in a shop window with a price tag did not make an offer to sell it, because of the specific meaning of &quot;offer for sale&quot; in contract law, merely an invitation to treat. As a result of this case, Parliament amended the statute concerned to end this discrepancy.

The golden rule is used when use of the literal rule would obviously create an absurd result. There are two ways in which the golden rule can be applied: a narrow method, and a broad method. Under the narrow method, when there are apparently two contradictory meanings to the wording of a legislative provision, or the wording is ambiguous, the least absurd is to be preferred. Under the broad method, the court modifies the literal meaning in such a way as to avoid the absurd result. An example of the latter approach is &quot;Adler v George&quot; (1964). Under the Official Secrets Act 1920 it was an offence to obstruct HM Forces &quot;in the vicinity of&quot; a prohibited place. Adler argued that he was not in the &quot;vicinity&quot; of such a place but was actually &quot;in&quot; it. The court chose not to read the statutory wording in a literal sense to avoid what would otherwise be an absurd result, and Adler was convicted.

The mischief rule is the most flexible of the interpretation methods. Stemming from &quot;Heydon&#x27;s Case&quot; (1584), it allows the court to enforce what the statute is intended to remedy rather than what the words actually say. For example, in &quot;Corkery v Carpenter&quot; (1950), a man was found guilty of being drunk in charge of a carriage, although in fact he only had a bicycle. The final rule; although will no longer be used after the UK fully transitions out of the European Union. Known as the Purposive approach- this considers the intention of the European Court of Justice when the act was passed.

===Statutory interpretation in the United States===
In the United States, the courts have stated consistently that the text of the statute is read as it is written, using the ordinary meaning of the words of the statute.
*&quot;[I]n interpreting a statute a court should always turn to one cardinal canon before all others. ... [C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.&quot; &quot;Connecticut Nat&#x27;l Bank v. Germain&quot;, 112 S. Ct. 1146, 1149 (1992). Indeed, &quot;[w]hen the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: &#x27;judicial inquiry is complete.&#x27; &quot;
*&quot;A fundamental rule of statutory construction requires that every part of a statute be presumed to have some effect, and not be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary.&quot; &quot;Raven Coal Corp. v. Absher&quot;, 153 Va. 332, 149 S.E. 541 (1929).
*&quot;In assessing statutory language, unless words have acquired a peculiar meaning, by virtue of statutory definition or judicial construction, they are to be construed in accordance with their common usage.&quot; &quot;Muller v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc.&quot;, 923 P.2d 783, 787–88 (Alaska 1996).

However, most legal texts have some lingering ambiguity—inevitably, situations arise in which the words chosen by the legislature do not address the precise facts in issue, or there is some tension among two or more statutes. In such cases, a court must analyze the various available sources, and reach a resolution of the ambiguity. The &quot;Canons of statutory construction&quot; are discussed in a separate article. Once the ambiguity is resolved, that resolution has binding effect as described in the rest of this article.

==Practical application==
Although inferior courts are bound in theory by superior court precedent, in practice a judge may believe that justice requires an outcome at some variance with precedent, and may distinguish the facts of the individual case on reasoning that does not appear in the binding precedent. On appeal, the appellate court may either adopt the new reasoning, or reverse on the basis of precedent. On the other hand, if the losing party does not appeal (typically because of the cost of the appeal), the lower court decision may remain in effect, at least as to the individual parties.

===Judicial resistance===
Occasionally, lower court judges may explicitly state a personal disagreement with the rendered judgment, but are required to rule a particular way because of binding precedent. Inferior courts cannot evade binding precedent of superior courts, but a court can depart from its own prior decisions.

===Structural considerations===
In the United States, &quot;stare decisis&quot; can interact in counterintuitive ways with the federal and state court systems. On an issue of federal law, a state court is not bound by an interpretation of federal law at the district or circuit level, but is bound by an interpretation by the United States Supreme Court. On an interpretation of state law, whether common law or statutory law, the federal courts are bound by the interpretation of a state court of last resort, and are required normally to defer to the precedent of intermediate state courts as well.

Courts may choose to obey precedent of international jurisdictions, but this is not an application of the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot;, because foreign decisions are not binding. Rather, a foreign decision that is obeyed on the basis of the soundness of its reasoning will be called &quot;persuasive authority&quot;—indicating that its effect is limited to the persuasiveness of the reasons it provides.

===Originalism===
Originalism is an approach to interpretation of a legal text in which controlling weight is given to the intent of the original authors (at least the intent as inferred by a modern judge). In contrast, a non-originalist looks at other cues to meaning, including the current meaning of the words, the pattern and trend of other judicial decisions, changing context and improved scientific understanding, observation of practical outcomes and &quot;what works&quot;, contemporary standards of justice, and &quot;stare decisis&quot;. Both are directed at &quot;interpreting&quot; the text, not changing it—interpretation is the process of resolving ambiguity and choosing from among possible meanings, not changing the text.

The two approaches look at different sets of underlying facts that may or may not point in the same direction—&quot;stare decisis&quot; gives most weight to the newest understanding of a legal text, while originalism gives most weight to the oldest. While they do not necessarily reach different results in every case, the two approaches are in direct tension. Originalists such as Justice Antonin Scalia argue that &quot;&quot;Stare decisis&quot; is not usually a doctrine used in civil law systems, because it violates the principle that only the legislature may make law.&quot; Justice Scalia argues that America is a civil law nation, not a common law nation. By principle, originalists are generally unwilling to defer to precedent when precedent seems to come into conflict with the originalist&#x27;s own interpretation of the Constitutional text or inferences of original intent (even in situations where there is no original source statement of that original intent). However, there is still room within an originalist paradigm for &quot;stare decisis&quot;; whenever the plain meaning of the text has alternative constructions, past precedent is generally considered a valid guide, with the qualifier being that it cannot change what the text actually says.

Originalists vary in the degree to which they defer to precedent. In his confirmation hearings, Justice Clarence Thomas answered a question from Senator Strom Thurmond, qualifying his willingness to change precedent in this way:

Possibly he has changed his mind, or there are a very large body of cases which merit &quot;the additional step&quot; of ignoring the doctrine; according to Scalia, &quot;Clarence Thomas doesn&#x27;t believe in stare decisis, period. If a constitutional line of authority is wrong, he would say, let&#x27;s get it right.&quot;

Caleb Nelson, a former clerk for Justice Thomas and law professor at the University of Virginia, has elaborated on the role of &quot;stare decisis&quot; in originalist jurisprudence:

===Criticism of precedent===

One of the most prominent critics of the development of legal precedent on a case-by-case basis as both overly reactive and unfairly retroactive was philosopher Jeremy Bentham. He famously attacked the common law as &quot;dog law&quot;:
In a 1997 book, attorney Michael Trotter blamed overreliance by American lawyers on precedent — especially persuasive authority of marginal relevance — rather than the merits of the case at hand, as a major factor behind the escalation of legal costs during the 20th century. He argued that courts should ban the citation of persuasive authority from outside their jurisdiction and force lawyers and parties to argue only from binding precedent, subject to two exceptions:

# cases where the foreign jurisdiction&#x27;s law is the subject of the case, or
# instances where a litigant intends to ask the highest court of the jurisdiction to overturn binding precedent, and therefore needs to cite persuasive precedent to demonstrate a countervailing trend in other jurisdictions.

The disadvantages of &quot;stare decisis&quot; include its rigidity, the complexity of learning law, the fact that differences between certain cases may be very small and thereby appear illogical and arbitrary, and the slow growth or incremental changes to the law that are in need of major overhaul.

An argument often leveled against precedent is that it is undemocratic because it allows judges, who may or may not be elected, to make law.

===Agreement with precedent===

A counter-argument (in favor of the advantages of &quot;stare decisis&quot;) is that if the legislature wishes to alter the case law (other than constitutional interpretations) by statute, the legislature is empowered to do so. Critics sometimes accuse particular judges of applying the doctrine selectively, invoking it to support precedent that the judge supported anyway, but ignoring it in order to change precedent with which the judge disagreed

There is much discussion about the virtue of using &quot;stare decisis&quot;. Supporters of the system, such as minimalists, argue that obeying precedent makes decisions &quot;predictable&quot;. For example, a business person can be reasonably assured of predicting a decision where the facts of his or her case are sufficiently similar to a case decided previously. This parallels the arguments against retroactive (ex post facto) laws banned by the U.S. Constitution .
