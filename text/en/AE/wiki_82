<text>Philip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928 – March 2, 1982), often referred to by his initials PKD, was an American science fiction writer and novelist. He wrote 44 novels and about 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime. His fiction explored varied philosophical and social questions such as the nature of reality, perception, human nature, and identity, and commonly featured characters struggling against elements such as alternate realities, illusory environments, monopolistic corporations, drug abuse, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness. He is considered one of the most important figures in 20th-century science fiction.

Born in Chicago, Dick moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his family at a young age. He began publishing science fiction stories in 1952, at age 23. He found little commercial success until his alternative history novel &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; (1962) earned him acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel, when he was 33. He followed with science fiction novels such as &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; (1968) and &quot;Ubik&quot; (1969). His 1974 novel &quot;Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said&quot; won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.

Following years of drug abuse and a series of mystical experiences in 1974, Dick&#x27;s work engaged more explicitly with issues of theology, metaphysics, and the nature of reality, as in novels &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (1977), &quot;VALIS&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot; (1982). A collection of his speculative nonfiction writing on these themes was published posthumously as &quot;The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick&quot; (2011). He died in 1982 in Santa Ana, California, at the age of 53, due to complications from a stroke. Following his death, he became &quot;widely regarded as a master of imaginative, paranoid fiction in the vein of Franz Kafka and Thomas Pynchon&quot;.

Dick&#x27;s posthumous influence has been widespread, extending beyond literary circles into Hollywood filmmaking. Popular films based on his works include &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), &quot;Total Recall&quot; (adapted twice: in 1990 and in 2012), &quot;Screamers&quot; (1995), &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (2006), &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot; (2011), and &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; (2010). Beginning in 2015, Amazon Prime Video produced the multi-season television adaptation &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, based on Dick&#x27;s 1962 novel; and in 2017 Channel 4 produced the anthology series &quot;Electric Dreams&quot;, based on various Dick stories.

In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;Ubik&quot; (1969) one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923. In 2007, Dick became the first science fiction writer included in The Library of America series.

==Early life==

Dick and his twin sister, Jane Charlotte Dick, were born six weeks prematurely on December 16, 1928, in Chicago, Illinois, to Dorothy (née Kindred; 1900–1978) and Joseph Edgar Dick (1899–1985), who worked for the United States Department of Agriculture. His paternal grandparents were Irish. Jane&#x27;s death on January 26, 1929, six weeks after their birth, profoundly affected Philip&#x27;s life, leading to the recurrent motif of the &quot;phantom twin&quot; in his books.

Dick&#x27;s family later moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. When he was five, his father was transferred to Reno, Nevada, and when Dorothy refused to move, she and Joseph divorced. Both fought for custody of Philip, which was awarded to Dorothy. Determined to raise Philip alone, she took a job in Washington, D.C., and moved there with her son. Philip was enrolled at John Eaton Elementary School (1936–1938), completing the second through fourth grades. His lowest grade was a &quot;C&quot; in Written Composition, although a teacher said he &quot;shows interest and ability in story telling&quot;. He was educated in Quaker schools. In June 1938, Dorothy and Philip returned to California, and it was around this time that he became interested in science fiction. Dick stated that he read his first science fiction magazine, &quot;Stirring Science Stories,&quot; in 1940.

Dick attended Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California. He and fellow science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin were members of the class of 1947 but did not know each other at the time. He claimed to have hosted a classical music program on KSMO Radio in 1947. From 1948 to 1952, he worked at Art Music Company, a record store on Telegraph Avenue.

He attended the University of California, Berkeley from September 1949 to November 11, 1949, ultimately receiving an honorable dismissal dated January 1, 1950. He did not declare a major and took classes in history, psychology, philosophy, and zoology. Dick dropped out because of ongoing anxiety problems, according to his third wife Anne&#x27;s memoir. She also says he disliked the mandatory ROTC training. At Berkeley, he befriended poet Robert Duncan and poet and linguist Jack Spicer, who gave Dick ideas for a Martian language.

Through his studies in philosophy, he believed that existence is based on internal human perception, which does not necessarily correspond to external reality. He described himself as &quot;an acosmic panentheist&quot;, which he explained as meaning that &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that the universe exists. I believe that the only thing that exists is God and he is more than the universe. The universe is an extension of God into space and time. That&#x27;s the premise I start from in my work, that so-called &#x27;reality&#x27; is a mass delusion that we&#x27;ve all been required to believe for reasons totally obscure&quot;. After reading the works of Plato and pondering the possibilities of metaphysical realms, he came to the conclusion that, in a certain sense, the world is not entirely real and there is no way to confirm whether it is truly there. That question was a theme in many of his novels.

==Career==
===Early writing===

Dick sold his first story, &quot;Roog&quot;—about &quot;a dog who imagined that the garbagemen who came every Friday morning were stealing valuable food which the family had carefully stored away in a safe metal container&quot;—in 1951, when he was 22. From then on he wrote full-time. During 1952, his first speculative fiction publications appeared in July and September numbers of &quot;Planet Stories&quot;, edited by Jack O&#x27;Sullivan, and in &quot;If&quot; and &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; that year. His debut novel, &quot;Solar Lottery&quot;, was published in 1955 as half of Ace Double #D-103 alongside &quot;The Big Jump&quot; by Leigh Brackett. The 1950s were a difficult and impoverished time for Dick, who once lamented, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t even pay the late fees on a library book.&quot; He published almost exclusively within the science fiction genre but dreamed of a career in mainstream fiction. During the 1950s, he produced a series of non-genre, relatively conventional novels.

In 1960, Dick wrote that he was willing to &quot;take twenty to thirty years to succeed as a literary writer&quot;. The dream of mainstream success formally died in January 1963 when the Scott Meredith Literary Agency returned all of his unsold mainstream novels. Only one of them, &quot;Confessions of a Crap Artist&quot;, was published during Dick&#x27;s lifetime, in 1975 by Paul Williams&#x27; Entwhistle Books.

In 1963 Dick won the Hugo Award for &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;. Although he was hailed as a genius in the science fiction world, the mainstream literary world was unappreciative, and he could publish books only through low-paying science fiction publishers such as Ace. He said in a 1977 interview that were it not for interest by a French publishing company in the mid-1960s, which decided to publish all of his catalog to date, he would not have been able to continue as a writer. But even in his later years, he continued to have financial troubles. In the introduction to the 1980 short story collection, &quot;The Golden Man&quot;, he wrote:
===Flight to Canada, mental health and suicide attempt===
In 1971, Dick&#x27;s marriage to Nancy Hackett broke down, and she moved out of their house in Santa Venetia, California. He had abused amphetamine for much of the previous decade, stemming in part from his need to maintain a prolific writing regimen due to the financial exigencies of the science fiction field. He allowed other drug users to move into the house. Following the release of 21 novels between 1960 and 1970, these developments were exacerbated by unprecedented periods of writer&#x27;s block, with Dick ultimately failing to publish new fiction until 1974.

One day, in November 1971, Dick returned to his home to discover it had been burglarized, with his safe blown open and personal papers missing. The police could not determine the culprit, and even suspected Dick of having done it himself. Shortly thereafter, he was invited to be guest of honor at the Vancouver Science Fiction Convention in February 1972. Within a day of arriving at the conference and giving his speech, &quot;The Android and the Human&quot;, he informed people that he had fallen in love with a woman named Janis whom he had met there and announced that he would be remaining in Vancouver. A conference attendee, Michael Walsh, movie critic for the local newspaper &quot;The Province&quot;, invited Dick to stay in his home, but asked him to leave two weeks later due to his erratic behavior. Janis then ended their relationship and moved away. On March 23, 1972, Dick attempted suicide by taking an overdose of the sedative potassium bromide. Subsequently, after deciding to seek help, Dick became a participant in X-Kalay (a Canadian Synanon-type recovery program), and was well enough by April to return to California. In October 1972, Dick wrote a letter to the FBI about science fiction writer Thomas Disch. Dick said he had been approached by a covert Anti-American organization which attempted to recruit him. Dick said he recognized their ideology in a book Disch wrote.

On relocating to Orange County, California at the behest of California State University, Fullerton professor Willis McNelly (who initiated a correspondence with Dick during his X-Kalay stint), he donated manuscripts, papers and other materials to the university&#x27;s Special Collections Library, where they are in the Philip K. Dick Science Fiction Collection in the Pollak Library. During this period, Dick befriended a circle of Fullerton State students that included several aspiring science fiction writers, including K. W. Jeter, James Blaylock and Tim Powers. Jeter would later continue Dick&#x27;s Bladerunner series with three sequels.

Dick returned to the events of these months while writing his novel &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (1977), which contains fictionalized depictions of the burglary of his home, his time using amphetamines and living with addicts, and his experiences of X-Kalay (portrayed in the novel as &quot;New-Path&quot;). A factual account of his recovery program participation was portrayed in his posthumously released book &quot;The Dark Haired Girl&quot;, a collection of letters and journals from the period.

===Paranormal experiences===
On February 20, 1974, while recovering from the effects of sodium pentothal administered for the extraction of an impacted wisdom tooth, Dick received a home delivery of Darvon from a young woman. When he opened the door, he was struck by the dark-haired girl&#x27;s beauty, and was especially drawn to her golden necklace. He asked her about its curious fish-shaped design. As she was leaving, she replied: &quot;This is a sign used by the early Christians.&quot; Dick called the symbol the &quot;vesicle pisces&quot;. This name seems to have been based on his conflation of two related symbols, the Christian ichthys symbol (two intersecting arcs delineating a fish in profile), which the woman was wearing, and the vesica piscis.

Dick recounted that as the sun glinted off the gold pendant, the reflection caused the generation of a &quot;pink beam&quot; of light that mesmerized him. He came to believe the beam imparted wisdom and clairvoyance, and also believed it to be intelligent. On one occasion, he was startled by a separate recurrence of the pink beam, which imparted the information that his infant son was ill. The Dicks rushed the child to the hospital, where the illness was confirmed by professional diagnosis.

After the woman&#x27;s departure, Dick began experiencing strange hallucinations. Although initially attributing them to side effects from medication, he considered this explanation implausible after weeks of continued hallucination. He told Charles Platt: &quot;I experienced an invasion of my mind by a transcendentally rational mind, as if I had been insane all my life and suddenly I had become sane.&quot;

Throughout February and March 1974, Dick experienced a series of hallucinations which he referred to as &quot;2-3-74&quot;, shorthand for February–March 1974. Aside from the &quot;pink beam&quot;, he described the initial hallucinations as geometric patterns, and, occasionally, brief pictures of Jesus and ancient Rome. As the hallucinations increased in duration and frequency, Dick claimed he began to live two parallel lives—one as himself, &quot;Philip K. Dick&quot;, and one as &quot;Thomas&quot;, a Christian persecuted by Romans in the first century AD. He referred to the &quot;transcendentally rational mind&quot; as &quot;Zebra&quot;, &quot;God&quot; and &quot;VALIS&quot; (an acronym for &quot;Vast Active Living Intelligence System&quot;). He wrote about the experiences, first in the semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;, then in &quot;VALIS&quot;, &quot;The Divine Invasion&quot;, &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot; and the unfinished &quot;The Owl in Daylight&quot; (the VALIS trilogy).

In 1974, Dick wrote a letter to the FBI, accusing various people, including University of California, San Diego professor Fredric Jameson, of being foreign agents of Warsaw Pact powers. He also wrote that Stanisław Lem was probably a false name used by a composite committee operating on orders of the Communist party to gain control over public opinion.

At one point, Dick felt he had been taken over by the spirit of the prophet Elijah. He believed that an episode in his novel &quot;Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said&quot; was a detailed retelling of a biblical story from the Book of Acts, which he had never read. He documented and discussed his experiences and faith in a private journal he called his &quot;exegesis&quot;, portions of which were later published as &quot;The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick&quot;. The last novel he wrote was &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot;; it was published shortly after his death in 1982.

==Personal life==
Dick was married five times:
* Jeanette Marlin (May to November 1948)
* Kleo Apostolides (June 14, 1950, to 1959)
* Anne Williams Rubinstein (April 1, 1959, to October 1965)
* Nancy Hackett (July 6, 1966, to 1972)
* Leslie &quot;Tessa&quot; Busby (April 18, 1973, to 1977)

Dick had three children, Laura Archer Dick (born February 25, 1960, to Dick and his third wife, Anne Williams Rubenstein), Isolde Freya Dick (now Isa Dick Hackett) (born March 15, 1967, to Dick and his fourth wife, Nancy Hackett), and Christopher Kenneth Dick (born July 25, 1973, to Dick and his fifth wife, Leslie &quot;Tessa&quot; Busby).

In 1955, Dick and his second wife, Kleo Apostolides, received a visit from the FBI, which they believed to be the result of Kleo&#x27;s socialist views and left-wing activities.

He physically fought with Anne Williams Rubinstein, his third wife. Dick wrote to a friend that he and Anne had &quot;dreadful violent fights...slamming each other around, smashing every object in the house.&quot; In 1963, Dick told his neighbors that his wife was attempting to kill him and had her involuntarily committed to a psychiatric institution for two weeks. After filing for divorce in 1964, Dick moved to Oakland to live with a fan, author and editor Grania Davis. Shortly after, he attempted suicide by driving off the road while she was a passenger.

===Politics===

Early in life, Dick attended Communist Party USA meetings, but shifted more towards anti-communism and libertarianism as time passed. In an interview, Dick once described himself as a &quot;religious anarchist&quot;.

Dick generally tried to stay out of the political scene because of high societal turmoil from the Vietnam War. Still, he did show some anti-Vietnam War and anti-governmental sentiments. In 1968, he joined the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot;, an anti-war pledge to pay no U.S. federal income tax, which resulted in the confiscation of his car by the IRS. Dick was a critic of the U.S. federal government, regarding it to be just as &quot;bad as the Soviet Union&quot;, and cheered on &quot;a great decentralization of the government&quot;.

Dick&#x27;s politics occasionally influenced his literature. Dick&#x27;s 1967 short story &quot;Faith of Our Fathers&quot; is critical of communism. Dick&#x27;s 1968 novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; condemns the eugenics movement. In 1974, as a response to the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision, Dick also published &quot;The Pre-persons&quot;, a satirical anti-abortion and anti-Malthusianism short story. Following the story&#x27;s publication, Dick stated that he received death threats from feminists.

==Death==
On February 17, 1982, after completing an interview, Dick contacted his therapist, complaining of failing eyesight, and was advised to go to a hospital immediately, but did not. The following day, he was found unconscious on the floor of his Santa Ana, California, home, having suffered a stroke. On February 25, 1982, Dick suffered another stroke in the hospital, which led to brain death. Five days later, on March 2, 1982, he was disconnected from life support.

After his death, Dick&#x27;s father, Joseph, took his son&#x27;s ashes to Riverside Cemetery in Fort Morgan, Colorado (section K, block 1, lot 56), where they were buried next to his twin sister Jane, who died in infancy. Her tombstone had been inscribed with both of their names at the time of her death, 53 years earlier. Philip died four months before the release of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, the film based on his novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;

==Style and works==

===Themes===
Dick&#x27;s stories typically focus on the fragile nature of what is real and the construction of personal identity. His stories often become surreal fantasies, as the main characters slowly discover that their everyday world is actually an illusion assembled by powerful external entities, such as the suspended animation in &quot;Ubik&quot;, vast political conspiracies or the vicissitudes of an unreliable narrator. &quot;All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality&quot;, writes science fiction author Charles Platt. &quot;Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person&#x27;s dream, or he may enter a drug-induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely.&quot;

Alternate universes and simulacra are common plot devices, with fictional worlds inhabited by common, working people, rather than galactic elites. &quot;There are no heroes in Dick&#x27;s books&quot;, Ursula K. Le Guin wrote, &quot;but there are heroics. One is reminded of Dickens: what counts is the honesty, constancy, kindness and patience of ordinary people.&quot; Dick made no secret that much of his thinking and work was heavily influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. The Jungian constructs and models that most concerned Dick seem to be the archetypes of the collective unconscious, group projection/hallucination, synchronicities, and personality theory. Many of Dick&#x27;s protagonists overtly analyze reality and their perceptions in Jungian terms (see &quot;Lies, Inc.&quot;).

Dick identified one major theme of his work as the question, &quot;What constitutes the authentic human being?&quot; In works such as &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, beings can appear totally human in every respect while lacking soul or compassion, while completely alien beings such as Glimmung in &quot;Galactic Pot-Healer&quot; may be more humane and complex than their human peers. Understood correctly, said Dick, the term &quot;human being&quot; applies &quot;not to origin or to any ontology but to a way of being in the world.&quot; This authentic way of being manifests itself in compassion that recognizes the oneness of all life. &quot;In Dick&#x27;s vision, the moral imperative calls on us to care for all sentient beings, human or nonhuman, natural or artificial, regardless of their place in the order of things. And Dick makes clear that this imperative is grounded in empathy, not reason, whatever subsequent role reason may play.&quot; The figure of the android depicts those who are deficient in empathy, who are alienated from others and are becoming more mechanical (emotionless) in their behaviour. &quot;In general, then, it can be said that for Dick robots represent machines that are becoming more like humans, while androids represent humans that are becoming more like machines.&quot;

Mental illness was a constant interest of Dick&#x27;s, and themes of mental illness permeate his work. The character Jack Bohlen in the 1964 novel &quot;Martian Time-Slip&quot; is an &quot;ex-schizophrenic&quot;. The novel &quot;Clans of the Alphane Moon&quot; centers on an entire society made up of descendants of lunatic asylum inmates. In 1965, he wrote the essay titled &quot;Schizophrenia and the Book of Changes&quot;.

Drug use (including religious, recreational, and abuse) was also a theme in many of Dick&#x27;s works, such as &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; and &quot;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch&quot;. Dick himself was a drug user for much of his life. According to a 1975 interview in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Dick wrote all of his books published before 1970 while on amphetamines. &quot;&quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (1977) was the first complete novel I had written without speed&quot;, said Dick in the interview. He also experimented briefly with psychedelics, but wrote &quot;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch&quot; (1965), which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; dubs &quot;the classic LSD novel of all time&quot;, before he had ever tried them. Despite his heavy amphetamine use, however, Dick later said that doctors told him the amphetamines never actually affected him, that his liver had processed them before they reached his brain.

Summing up all these themes in &quot;Understanding Philip K. Dick&quot;, Eric Carl Link discussed eight themes or &quot;ideas and motifs&quot;: Epistemology and the Nature of Reality, Know Thyself, The Android and the Human, Entropy and Pot Healing, The Theodicy Problem, Warfare and Power Politics, The Evolved Human, and &quot;Technology, Media, Drugs and Madness&quot;.

===Pen names===
Dick had two professional stories published under the pen names Richard Phillipps and Jack Dowland. &quot;Some Kinds of Life&quot; was published in October 1953 in &quot;Fantastic Universe&quot; under byline Richard Phillipps, apparently because the magazine had a policy against publishing multiple stories by the same author in the same issue; &quot;Planet for Transients&quot; was published in the same issue under his own name.

The short story &quot;Orpheus with Clay Feet&quot; was published under the pen name Jack Dowland. The protagonist desires to be the muse for fictional author Jack Dowland, considered the greatest science fiction author of the 20th century. In the story, Dowland publishes a short story titled &quot;Orpheus with Clay Feet&quot; under the pen name Philip K. Dick.

The surname Dowland refers to Renaissance composer John Dowland, who is featured in several works. The title &quot;Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said&quot; directly refers to Dowland&#x27;s best-known composition, &quot;Flow, my tears&quot;. In the novel &quot;The Divine Invasion&quot;, the character Linda Fox, created specifically with Linda Ronstadt in mind, is an intergalactically famous singer whose entire body of work consists of recordings of John Dowland compositions.

===Selected works===

&quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; (1962) is set in an alternative history in which the United States is ruled by the victorious Axis powers. It is the only Dick novel to win a Hugo Award. In 2015 this was adapted into a television series by Amazon Studios.

&quot;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch&quot; (1965) utilizes an array of science fiction concepts and features several layers of reality and unreality. It is also one of Dick&#x27;s first works to explore religious themes. The novel takes place in the 21st century, when, under UN authority, mankind has colonized the Solar System&#x27;s every habitable planet and moon. Life is physically daunting and psychologically monotonous for most colonists, so the UN must draft people to go to the colonies. Most entertain themselves using &quot;Perky Pat&quot; dolls and accessories manufactured by Earth-based &quot;P.P. Layouts&quot;. The company also secretly creates &quot;Can-D&quot;, an illegal but widely available hallucinogenic drug allowing the user to &quot;translate&quot; into Perky Pat (if the drug user is a woman) or Pat&#x27;s boyfriend, Walt (if the drug user is a man). This recreational use of Can-D allows colonists to experience a few minutes of an idealized life on Earth by participating in a collective hallucination.

&quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; (1968) is the story of a bounty hunter policing the local android population. It occurs on a dying, poisoned Earth de-populated of almost all animals and all &quot;successful&quot; humans; the only remaining inhabitants of the planet are people with no prospects off-world. The 1968 novel is the literary source of the film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982). It is both a conflation and an intensification of the pivotally Dickian question: &quot;What is real, what is fake? What crucial factor defines humanity as distinctly &#x27;alive&#x27;, versus those merely alive only in their outward appearance?&quot;

&quot;Ubik&quot; (1969) employs extensive psychic telepathy and a suspended state after death in creating a state of eroding reality. A group of psychics is sent to investigate a rival organisation, but several of them are apparently killed by a saboteur&#x27;s bomb. Much of the following novel flicks between different equally plausible realities and the &quot;real&quot; reality, a state of half-life and psychically manipulated realities. In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed it among the &quot;All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels&quot; published since 1923.

&quot;Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said&quot; (1974) concerns Jason Taverner, a television star living in a dystopian near-future police state. After being attacked by an angry ex-girlfriend, Taverner awakens in a dingy Los Angeles hotel room. He still has his money in his wallet, but his identification cards are missing. This is no minor inconvenience, as security checkpoints (staffed by &quot;pols&quot; and &quot;nats&quot;, the police and National Guard) are set up throughout the city to stop and arrest anyone without valid ID. Jason at first thinks that he was robbed, but soon discovers that his entire identity has been erased. There is no record of him in any official database, and even his closest associates do not recognize or remember him. For the first time in many years, Jason has no fame or reputation to rely on. He has only his innate charm and social graces to help him as he tries to find out what happened to his past while avoiding the attention of the pols. The novel was Dick&#x27;s first published novel after years of silence, during which time his critical reputation had grown, and this novel was awarded the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. It is the only Philip K. Dick novel nominated for both a Hugo and a Nebula Award.

In an essay written two years before his death, Dick described how he learned from his Episcopal priest that an important scene in &quot;Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said&quot; – involving its other main character, the eponymous Police General Felix Buckman, was very similar to a scene in &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot;, a book of the New Testament. Film director Richard Linklater discusses this novel in his film &quot;Waking Life&quot;, which begins with a scene reminiscent of another Dick novel, &quot;Time Out of Joint&quot;.

&quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (1977) is a bleak mixture of science fiction and police procedural novels; in its story, an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose touch with reality after falling victim to Substance D, the same permanently mind-altering drug he was enlisted to help fight. Substance D is instantly addictive, beginning with a pleasant euphoria which is quickly replaced with increasing confusion, hallucinations and eventually total psychosis. In this novel, as with all Dick novels, there is an underlying thread of paranoia and dissociation with multiple realities perceived simultaneously. It was adapted to film by Richard Linklater.

&quot;The Philip K. Dick Reader&quot; is an introduction to the variety of Dick&#x27;s short fiction.

&quot;VALIS&quot; (1980) is perhaps Dick&#x27;s most postmodern and autobiographical novel, examining his own unexplained experiences. It may also be his most academically studied work, and was adapted as an opera by Tod Machover. Later works like the VALIS trilogy were heavily autobiographical, many with &quot;two-three-seventy-four&quot; (2-3-74) references and influences. The word VALIS is the acronym for &quot;Vast Active Living Intelligence System&quot;. Later, Dick theorized that VALIS was both a &quot;reality generator&quot; and a means of extraterrestrial communication. A fourth VALIS manuscript, &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;, although composed in 1976, was posthumously published in 1985. This work is described by the publisher (Arbor House) as &quot;an introduction and key to his magnificent VALIS trilogy&quot;.

Regardless of the feeling that he was somehow experiencing a divine communication, Dick was never fully able to rationalize the events. For the rest of his life, he struggled to comprehend what was occurring, questioning his own sanity and perception of reality. He transcribed what thoughts he could into an eight-thousand-page, one-million-word journal dubbed the &quot;Exegesis&quot;. From 1974 until his death in 1982, Dick spent many nights writing in this journal. A recurring theme in &quot;Exegesis&quot; is Dick&#x27;s hypothesis that history had been stopped in the first century AD, and that &quot;the Empire never ended&quot;. He saw Rome as the pinnacle of materialism and despotism, which, after forcing the Gnostics underground, had kept the population of Earth enslaved to worldly possessions. Dick believed that VALIS had communicated with him, and anonymously others, to induce the impeachment of U.S. President Richard Nixon, whom Dick believed to be the current Emperor of Rome incarnate.

In a 1968 essay titled &quot;Self Portrait&quot;, collected in the 1995 book &quot;The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick&quot;, Dick reflects on his work and lists which books he feels &quot;might escape World War Three&quot;: &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;, &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, &quot;Martian Time-Slip&quot;, &quot;Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb&quot;, &quot;The Zap Gun&quot;, &quot;The Penultimate Truth&quot;, &quot;The Simulacra&quot;, &quot;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch&quot; (which he refers to as &quot;the most vital of them all&quot;), &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, and &quot;Ubik&quot;. In a 1976 interview, Dick cited &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; as his best work, feeling that he &quot;had finally written a true masterpiece, after 25 years of writing&quot;.

===Adaptations===
====Films====
Several of Dick&#x27;s stories have been made into films. Dick himself wrote a screenplay for an intended film adaptation of &quot;Ubik&quot; in 1974, but the film was never made. Many film adaptations have not used Dick&#x27;s original titles. When asked why this was, Dick&#x27;s ex-wife Tessa said, &quot;Actually, the books rarely carry Phil&#x27;s original titles, as the editors usually wrote new titles after reading his manuscripts. Phil often commented that he couldn&#x27;t write good titles. If he could, he would have been an advertising writer instead of a novelist.&quot; Films based on Dick&#x27;s writing had accumulated a total revenue of over US$1 billion by 2009.
*&quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), based on Dick&#x27;s 1968 novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford, Sean Young and Rutger Hauer. A screenplay had been in the works for years before Scott took the helm, with Dick being extremely critical of all versions. Dick was still apprehensive about how his story would be adapted for the film when the project was finally put into motion. Among other things, he refused to do a novelization of the film. But when Dick was given an opportunity to watch a few sequences portraying the film&#x27;s imagined Los Angeles of 2019, he was amazed that the environment was &quot;exactly as how I&#x27;d imagined it!&quot; -- even though Ridley Scott has mentioned he had never even read the source material. Following the screening, Dick and Scott had a frank but cordial discussion of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;″s themes and characters, and although they had wildly differing views, Dick fully backed the film from then on, stating that his &quot;life and creative work are justified and completed by &quot;Blade Runner&quot;&quot;. Dick died from a stroke less than four months before the release of the film.
*&quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990), based on the short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot;, directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.
* &quot;Confessions d&#x27;un Barjo&quot; (1992), titled &quot;Barjo&quot; in its English-language release, a French film based on the non-science-fiction novel &quot;Confessions of a Crap Artist&quot;.
* &quot;Screamers&quot; (1995), based on the short story &quot;Second Variety&quot;, directed by Christian Duguay and starring Peter Weller. The location was altered from a war-devastated Earth to a distant planet. A sequel, titled &quot;&quot;, was released straight to DVD in 2009.
* &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), based on the short story &quot;The Minority Report&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise.
* &quot;Impostor&quot; (2002), based on the 1953 story &quot;Impostor&quot;, directed by Gary Fleder and starring Gary Sinise, Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio and Madeleine Stowe. The story was also adapted in 1962 for the British television anthology series &quot;Out of This World&quot;.
* &quot;Paycheck&quot; (2003), directed by John Woo and starring Ben Affleck, based on Dick&#x27;s short story of the same name.
* &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (2006), directed by Richard Linklater and starring Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, and Robert Downey Jr., based on Dick&#x27;s novel of the same name. The film was produced using the process of rotoscoping: it was first shot in live-action and then the live footage was animated over.
* &quot;Next&quot; (2007), directed by Lee Tamahori and starring Nicolas Cage, loosely based on the short story &quot;The Golden Man&quot;.
* &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; (2010), directed by John Alan Simon loosely based on the novel &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;.
* &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot; (2011), directed by George Nolfi and starring Matt Damon, loosely based on the short story &quot;Adjustment Team&quot;.
* &quot;Total Recall&quot; (2012), directed by Len Wiseman and starring Colin Farrell, second film adaptation of the short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot;.

Future films based on Dick&#x27;s writing include a film adaptation of &quot;Ubik&quot; which, according to Dick&#x27;s daughter, Isa Dick Hackett, is in advanced negotiation. Ubik was set to be made into a film by Michel Gondry. In 2014, however, Gondry told French outlet Telerama (via Jeux Actu), that he was no longer working on the project. In November 2021, it was announced that Francis Lawrence will direct a film adaptation of &quot;Vulcan&#x27;s Hammer&quot;, with Lawrence&#x27;s about:blank production company, alongside New Republic Pictures and Electric Shepherd Productions, producing.

The Halcyon Company, known for developing the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise, acquired right of first refusal to film adaptations of the works of Philip K. Dick in 2007. In May 2009, they announced plans for an adaptation of &quot;Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said&quot;.

In May 2016, it was announced that a 10-part anthology series was in the works. Titled &quot;Philip K. Dick&#x27;s Electric Dreams&quot;, the series was distributed by Sony Pictures Television and premiered on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom and Amazon Prime Video in the United States. It was written by executive producers Ronald D. Moore and Michael Dinner, with executive input from Dick&#x27;s daughter Isa Dick Hackett, and stars Bryan Cranston, also an executive producer.

====Stage and radio====
Four of Dick&#x27;s works have been adapted for the stage.

===Alternative formats===
In response to a 1975 request from the National Library for the Blind for permission to make use of &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, Dick responded, &quot;I also grant you a general permission to transcribe any of my former, present or future work, so indeed you can add my name to your &#x27;general permission&#x27; list.&quot; Some of his books and stories are available in braille and other specialized formats through the NLS.

==Influence and legacy==
Lawrence Sutin wrote a 1989 biography of Dick, titled &quot;Divine Invasions: A Life of Philip K. Dick&quot;.

In 1993, French writer Emmanuel Carrère published &quot;I Am Alive and You Are Dead: A Journey into the Mind of Philip K. Dick&quot; (), which the author describes in his preface in this way:The book you hold in your hands is a very peculiar book. I have tried to depict the life of Philip K. Dick from the inside, in other words, with the same freedom and empathy – indeed with the same truth – with which he depicted his own characters. The book omits fact checking, sourcing, notes and index. It can be considered a non-fiction novel about his life.

Dick has influenced many writers, including Jonathan Lethem and Ursula K. Le Guin. The prominent literary critic Fredric Jameson proclaimed Dick the &quot;Shakespeare of Science Fiction&quot;, and praised his work as &quot;one of the most powerful expressions of the society of spectacle and pseudo-event&quot;. The author Roberto Bolaño also praised Dick, describing him as &quot;Thoreau plus the death of the American dream&quot;. Dick has also influenced filmmakers, his work being compared to films such as the Wachowskis&#x27; &quot;The Matrix&quot;, David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Videodrome&quot;, &quot;eXistenZ&quot;, and &quot;Spider&quot;, Spike Jonze&#x27;s &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, &quot;Adaptation&quot;, Michel Gondry&#x27;s &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;, Alex Proyas&#x27;s &quot;Dark City&quot;, Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, Andrew Niccol&#x27;s &quot;Gattaca&quot;, &quot;In Time&quot;, Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;, Alejandro Amenábar&#x27;s &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, David Fincher&#x27;s &quot;Fight Club&quot;, Cameron Crowe&#x27;s &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &quot;Pi&quot;, Richard Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; and &quot;Southland Tales&quot;, Rian Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Looper&quot;, Duncan Jones&#x27; &quot;Source Code&quot;, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;Inception,&quot; and Owen Dennis&#x27; &quot;Infinity Train&quot;.

The Philip K. Dick Society was an organization dedicated to promoting the literary works of Dick and was led by Dick&#x27;s longtime friend and music journalist Paul Williams. Williams also served as Dick&#x27;s literary executor for several years after Dick&#x27;s death and wrote one of the first biographies of Dick, entitled &quot;Only Apparently Real: The World of Philip K. Dick&quot;.

The Philip K. Dick estate owns and operates the production company Electric Shepherd Productions, which has produced the film &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot; (2011), the TV series &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; and also a Marvel Comics 5-issue adaptation of &quot;Electric Ant&quot;.
Dick was recreated by his fans in the form of a simulacrum or remote-controlled android designed in his likeness. Such simulacra had been themes of many of Dick&#x27;s works. The Philip K. Dick simulacrum was included on a discussion panel in a San Diego Comic Con presentation about the film adaptation of the novel, &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;. In February 2006, an America West Airlines employee misplaced the android&#x27;s head, and it has not yet been found. In January 2011, it was announced that Hanson Robotics had built a replacement.

===Contemporary philosophy===
Postmodernists such as Jean Baudrillard and Laurence Rickels have commented on Dick&#x27;s writing&#x27;s foreshadowing of postmodernity. Jean Baudrillard offers this interpretation:

&quot;It is hyperreal. It is a universe of simulation, which is something altogether different. And this is so not because Dick speaks specifically of simulacra. SF has always done so, but it has always played upon the double, on artificial replication or imaginary duplication, whereas here the double has disappeared. There is no more double; one is always already in the other world, an other world which is not another, without mirrors or projection or utopias as means for reflection. The simulation is impassable, unsurpassable, checkmated, without exteriority. We can no longer move &#x27;through the mirror&#x27; to the other side, as we could during the golden age of transcendence.&quot;
For his anti-government skepticism, Philip K. Dick was afforded minor mention in &quot;Mythmakers and Lawbreakers&quot;, a collection of interviews about fiction by anarchist authors. Noting his early authorship of &quot;The Last of the Masters&quot;, an anarchist-themed novelette, author Margaret Killjoy expressed that while Dick never fully sided with anarchism, his opposition to government centralization and organized religion has influenced anarchist interpretations of gnosticism.

She volunteered in Uganda and India, where she spent one week working with Mother Teresa, and donated her salary from &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot; to help fund the late nun&#x27;s mission.

==Early life==
Cruz was born on 28 April 1974 in the town of Alcobendas, province of Madrid, Spain, to Encarna Sánchez, an Andalusian hairdresser and personal manager, and Eduardo Cruz, an Extremaduran retailer and car mechanic. She has two siblings, Mónica, also an actress, and Eduardo, a singer. She also has a paternal half-sister, Salma. She was raised as a Roman Catholic. Cruz grew up in Alcobendas, and spent long hours at her grandmother&#x27;s apartment. She said she had a happy childhood. Cruz remembers &quot;playing with some friends and being aware that I was acting as I was playing with them. I would think of a character and pretend to be someone else.&quot;

Initially, Cruz focused on dance: she studied classical ballet for nine years at Spain&#x27;s National Conservatory. She took three years of Spanish ballet training and four years of theatre at Cristina Rota&#x27;s school. She said that ballet instilled discipline that proved important in her acting career. When she became a cinephile at ten or eleven, her father bought a Betamax machine, which was then quite rare in her neighborhood.

As a teenager, Cruz became interested in acting after seeing the film &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected several times because the agent felt that she was too young. Cruz commented on the experience, &quot;I was very extroverted as a kid... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I&#x27;m still with her after all these years.&quot; In 1989, at the age of fifteen, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency at which more than 300 other girls had applied. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz&#x27;s agent, commented, &quot;She was absolutely magic [at the audition]. It was obvious there was something ... impressive about this kid... She was ... green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within.&quot;

Her father, Eduardo, died at his home in Spain in 2015, aged sixty two, from a heart attack.

==Career==
===1989–1997: Early work===
In 1989, 15-year-old Cruz made her acting debut in a music video for the Spanish pop group Mecano&#x27;s song &quot;La Fuerza del Destino&quot;. Between 1990 and 1991, she hosted the Spanish TV channel Telecinco&#x27;s talk show &quot;La Quinta Marcha&quot;, a programme that was hosted by teenagers, aimed at a teenage audience. She also played in the &quot;Elle et lui&quot; episode of an erotic French TV series called &quot;Série rose&quot; in 1991, where she appeared nude. In 1991, Cruz made her feature film debut as the lead female role in the comedy drama art house film &quot;Jamón, jamón&quot;. In the film, she portrayed Silvia, a young woman who is expecting her first child with a man whose mother does not approve of the relationship and attempts to sabotage it by paying Javier Bardem&#x27;s character to seduce her. &quot;People&quot; magazine noted that after Cruz appeared topless in the film, she became &quot;a major sex symbol&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; in 1999, Cruz commented that &quot;it was a great part, but...I wasn&#x27;t really ready for the nudity. [...] But I have no regrets because I wanted to start working and it changed my life.&quot; Charlie Rose of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; noted that Cruz &quot;became an overnight sensation as much for her nude scenes as for her talent&quot;. When Rose asked Cruz if she was concerned about how she would be perceived after her role in the film, Cruz replied, &quot;I just knew I had to do the complete opposite.&quot; &quot;Jamón, jamón&quot; received favorable reviews, with Chris Hicks of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; describing Cruz&#x27;s portrayal of Silvia as &quot;enchanting&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, film critic Roger Ebert wrote &quot;it stars actors of considerable physical appeal, most particularly Penélope Cruz as Silvia&quot;. For her performance, Cruz was nominated for a Spanish Actors Union Newcomer Award and a Goya Award for Best Actress. The same year she appeared in the Academy Award-winning &quot;Belle Époque&quot; as the virginal Luz. &quot;People&quot; magazine noted that Cruz&#x27;s role as Luz showed that she was versatile.

From 1993 to 1996, Cruz appeared in ten Spanish and Italian films. At 20, she went to live in New York for two years at Christopher and Greenwich to study ballet and English between films. She recalls learning English &quot;kind of late&quot;, previously knowing only the dialogue she had learned for the casting and the phrases &quot;How are you?&quot; and &quot;Thank you&quot;.

In 1997, Cruz appeared in the Spanish comedy film &quot;Love Can Seriously Damage Your Health&quot;. She portrays Diana, a fan of the Beatles band member John Lennon; she tries unsuccessfully to meet him. Years later, after many failed relationships, Diana re-unites with an acquaintance under unusual circumstances. That same year, she appeared in the opening scene of Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s &quot;Live Flesh&quot; as a prostitute who gives birth on a bus and in &quot;Et hjørne af paradis&quot; (A Corner of Paradise) as Doña Helena. Cruz&#x27;s final appearance in 1997 was the Amenabar-directed Spanish sci-fi drama, &quot;Abre Los Ojos&quot;/ &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;. She plays Sofia, the love interest of Eduardo Noriega&#x27;s lead character. &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; received positive reviews, and was later remade by U.S. director Cameron Crowe as &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (who cast Cruz in the same role and Tom Cruise in Noriega&#x27;s role), but &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; was not commercially successful. Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal commented in his September 2002 review that Cruz &quot;has been getting some really bad reviews for her recent American work, but I personally think that she&#x27;s a more than decent actress, especially here, where she&#x27;s charming, moving and always believable. [...] There&#x27;s one shot in particular, where Cruz enters a room in a greenish glow, which is right out of Hitchcock&#x27;s picture [&quot;Vertigo&quot;].&quot;

===1998–2000: Early American film roles===
In 1998, Cruz appeared in her first American film as Billy Crudup&#x27;s consolation-prize Mexican girlfriend in Stephen Frears&#x27; western film &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot;. Cruz stated that she had difficulties understanding people speaking English while she was filming &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot;. The film was critically and commercially unsuccessful. Kevin Lally of the &quot;Film Journal International&quot; commented in his review for the film that &quot;in an ironic casting twist, the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz [...] is much more appealing as Josepha [than in her previous roles]&quot;. For her performance in the film, she was nominated for an ALMA Award for Best Actress.

Also in 1998, Cruz appeared in &quot;Don Juan&quot; and the Spanish period drama &quot;The Girl of Your Dreams&quot;. In &quot;The Girl of Your Dreams&quot; (La niña de tus ojos), Cruz portrayed Macarena Granada, a singer who is in an on-and-off relationship with Antonio Resines&#x27;s character Blas. They are part of a Francoist film troupe that travels from Spain during the Spanish Civil War to Nazi Germany for a joint production with UFA. Cruz&#x27;s performance in the film was praised by film critics, with Jonathan Holloland of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine writing &quot;if confirmation is still needed that Cruz is an actress first and a pretty face second, then here it is&quot;. A writer for &quot;Film4&quot; commented that &quot;Cruz herself is the inevitable focus of the film&quot; but noted that overall the film &quot;looks great&quot;. Cruz&#x27;s role as Macarena has been viewed as her &quot;largest role to date&quot;. For her performance, Cruz received a Goya Award and Spanish Actors&#x27; Union Award, and was nominated for a European Film Award. In 1999, Cruz worked with Almodóvar again in &quot;All About My Mother&quot;, playing Sister María Rosa Sanz, a pregnant nun with AIDS. The film received favorable reviews, and was commercially successful, grossing over $67 million worldwide, although it performed better at the box office internationally than domestically.

In 2000, she appeared in &quot;Woman on Top&quot; in the lead female role as Isabelle, a world-class chef who suffered from motion sickness since birth, her first American lead role. Lisa Nesselson of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine praised the performances of both Cruz and her co-star, Harold Perrineau, saying they &quot;burst off the screen&quot;, and added that Cruz has a charming accent. BBC News film critic Jane Crowther said that &quot;Cruz is wonderfully ditzy as the innocent abroad&quot; but remarked that &quot;it&#x27;s Harold Perrineau Jr as Monica who pockets the movie&quot;. Annlee Ellingson of &quot;Box Office&quot; magazine wrote &quot;Cruz is stunning in the role—innocent and vulnerable yet possessing a mature grace and determined strength, all while sizzling with unchecked sensuality.&quot; Also in 2000, she played Alejandra Villarreal, who is Matt Damon&#x27;s love interest in Billy Bob Thornton&#x27;s film adaptation of the western bestselling novel &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot;. Susan Stark of &quot;The Detroit News&quot; commented that in the film Thornton was able to guide Damon, Henry Thomas and Cruz to &quot;their most impressive performances in a major movie yet&quot;. However, Bob Longigo of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution &quot; was less enthusiastic about Cruz&#x27;s and Damon&#x27;s performance, saying that their &quot;resulting onscreen chemistry would hardly warm a can of beans&quot;.

===2001–2005: Breakthrough===
2001 marked a turning point year when Cruz starred in the feature films &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; and &quot;Blow&quot;. In &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, Cameron Crowe&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, she played Sofia Serrano, the love interest of Tom Cruise&#x27;s character. The film received mixed reviews, but made $200 million worldwide. Her performance was well received by critics, with BBC film critic Brandon Graydon saying that Cruz &quot;is an enchanting screen presence&quot;, and Ethan Alter of the &quot;Film Journal International&quot; noting that Cruz and her co-star Cruise were &quot;able to generate some actual chemistry&quot;. Her next film was &quot;Blow&quot;, adapted from Bruce Porter&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Blow: How a Small Town Boy Made $100 million with the Medellín Cocaine Cartel and Lost It All&quot;. She had a supporting role as Mirtha Jung, the wife of Johnny Depp&#x27;s character. The film received mixed reviews, but made $80 million worldwide. Nina Willdorf of the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; described Cruz as &quot;multi-talented&quot; and Mark Salvo of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; wrote &quot;I may be one of the last male holdouts to join the Cruz-Rules camp, but her tour de force performance here sucks you right in.&quot;

In 2001, she also appeared in &quot;Don&#x27;t Tempt Me&quot;, playing Carmen Ramos. The film received negative reviews. Jeff Vice of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; commented that &quot;unfortunately, casting Cruz as a tough girl is a hilariously bad [idea]&quot; and Michael Miller of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; writing that &quot;as Satan&#x27;s helper Carmen, Penélope Cruz doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to her cocaine-huffing enabler in &quot;Blow&quot;&quot;. Cruz&#x27;s last film in 2001 was &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot;, film adaption of the novel of the same name. She played Pelagia, who falls in love with another man while her fiancé is in battle during the Second World War. &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; was not well received by critics, but made $62 million worldwide. In 2002, she had a minor role in &quot;Waking Up in Reno&quot;. It had negative reviews and was a box office failure. The following year, Cruz had a supporting role in the horror film &quot;Gothika&quot; as Chloe Sava, a patient at a mental hospital. David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Cruz &quot;adds a serviceably malevolent edge to Chloe&#x27;s apparent madness&quot;. Cruz&#x27;s performance in &quot;Fanfan la Tulipe&quot;, also in 2003, was not well received, Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commenting that Cruz &quot;deserves a special Cannes Razzie for a performance of purest teak&quot;.

In 2004, Cruz appeared in the Christmas film &quot;Noel&quot; as Nina, the girlfriend of Paul Walker&#x27;s character and as Mia in the 1930s set romantic drama &quot;Head in the Clouds&quot;, set in the 1930s. 
Bruce Birkland of &quot;Jam! Canoe&quot; wrote, &quot;The story feels forced and the performances dreary, with the notable exception of Cruz, who seems to be in a different film from the rest of the cast.&quot; Desson Thompson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was more critical; his comment about the character&#x27;s &quot;pronounced limp&quot; was that &quot;Cruz (hardly the world&#x27;s greatest actress) can&#x27;t even perform without looking fake&quot;. The film performed poorly at the box office. She also starred in Sergio Castellitto&#x27;s melodrama &quot;Don&#x27;t Move&quot;. Cruz, who learned Italian for the role, won the David di Donatello for her performance. She also won the European Film Award for Best Actress for the film in 2004.

In 2005, Cruz appeared as Dr. Eva Rojas in the action adventure &quot;Sahara&quot;. She earned $1.6 million for her supporting role. The film grossed $110 million worldwide but did not recoup its $160 million budget. Moviefone dubbed the film &quot;one of the most famous flops in history&quot; and in 2007, listed it at 24 on its list of &quot;Biggest Box-Office Turkeys of All Time&quot;. Lori Hoffman of the &quot;Atlantic City Weekly&quot; felt Cruz put her &quot;considerable [acting] skills on cruise control as Dr Eva Rojas&quot; and James Berardnelli of ReelViews described Cruz&#x27;s performance as a &quot;black hole&quot;, that she &quot;lacks screen presence&quot;. Also in 2005, Cruz appeared in &quot;Chromophobia&quot;, screened at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival and released the following year. Mathew Turner of &quot;View London&quot; said Cruz&#x27;s character Gloria, a cancer-riddled prostitute, is &quot;actually more interesting than the main storyline&quot; while Time Evan&#x27;s of &quot;Sky Movies&quot; wrote, &quot;The Cruz/Ifans storyline—featuring the only two remotely sympathetic characters—never really fuses with the main plot.&quot; Her final 2005 film was &quot;Don&#x27;t Move&quot; playing Italia. Eric Harrison of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; noted that Cruz &quot;goes all out&quot; with her appearance and Patrick Peters of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine commented that the film&#x27;s director, who also appears in the film, was able to draw a &quot;sensitive performance&quot; from Cruz.

===2006–2009: Worldwide recognition===
Cruz appeared alongside her good friend Salma Hayek in the 2006 Western comedy film &quot;Bandidas&quot;. Randy Cordova of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; said the film &quot;sports&quot; Cruz and her co-star Salma Hayek as the &quot;lusty dream team&quot; and that they were the &quot;marketing fantasy&quot; for the film. Also in 2006, Cruz received favourable reviews for her performance as Raimunda, a working-class woman forced to go to great lengths to protect her 14-year-old daughter Paula, in Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s &quot;Volver&quot;. A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked, &quot;With this role Ms. Cruz inscribes her name near the top of any credible list of present-day flesh-and-blood screen goddesses, in no small part because she manages to be earthy, unpretentious and a little vulgar without shedding an ounce of her natural glamour.&quot; Likewise, Carina Chocano of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Cruz, who has remarked that in Hollywood she&#x27;s rarely allowed to be anything more than pretty, instills her with an awesome resoluteness and strength of character.&quot; She shared a Best Actress award at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival with five of her co-stars, as well as receiving a Goya Award and European Film Award, and was nominated for the Golden Globe, the Screen Actors Guild Award, the BAFTA Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a leading role. With this nomination, Cruz became the first Spanish actress ever nominated for an Academy Award.

In 2007, Cruz appeared in the lead female role in &quot;Manolete&quot;, a biopic of bullfighter Manuel Laureano Rodríguez Sánchez, playing Antoñita &quot;Lupe&quot; Sino. The film was critically panned, and &quot;Variety&quot; felt that Cruz has &quot;clearly been cast to play the kind of red-hot drama queen she&#x27;s pulled off infinitely better in the films of Pedro Almodovar&quot;. After being shelved since 2007, &quot;Manolete&quot; (originally shot in 2005) released on demand via cable, satellite, telco and online on 7 June 2011 under the title &quot;A Matador&#x27;s Mistress&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;The Good Night&quot;, playing two characters, Anna and Melody. TV Guide film critic Maitland McDonagh noted that in the film Cruz &quot;expertly mines the contrast between chic, compliant, white-clad Anna and funky, street-wise Melody, who treats [Martin Freeman&#x27;s character] Gary like the world-class drag he is&quot;.

In 2008, Cruz starred alongside Ben Kingsley in Isabel Coixet&#x27;s film &quot;Elegy&quot;, which was based on the Philip Roth story &quot;The Dying Animal&quot;, as the lead female role, Consuela Castillo. Ray Bennett of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described Cruz&#x27;s performance as being &quot;outstanding in an otherwise lame male fantasy [film]&quot;. That same year, Cruz appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&quot; as María Elena, a mentally unstable woman, which was received with critical acclaim. Writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle noted, &quot;But the revelation is Penélope Cruz, who has never been better in an American film. Suddenly, and for the first time, her stardom makes sense. As Maria Elena, José Antonio&#x27;s gifted and neurotic ex-wife, Cruz is on fire – hysterically funny, abandoned, passionate, poignant, with a performance full of shading and wide in range. She&#x27;s as fun and as powerful as Anna Magnani, and beautiful besides. Cruz just needed somebody to turn her loose.&quot; Likewise, Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; singled her out for praise, writing: &quot;Cruz, playing Maria Elena, the passionate and crazy ex-wife of a moody Picasso-ish artist, looks as if she has wandered in from a more hefty film entirely; everything she does and says seems to mean more, count for more. This isn&#x27;t to say that she gets bigger laughs, or perhaps any laughs, but she certainly walks off with the film&quot;. Cruz received a Goya Award and her first Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also received a Golden Globe and SAG nomination. With her Oscar win, Cruz became the first, and to date only, Spanish actress to ever be awarded an Academy Award, as well as the sixth Hispanic performer to have received the award.

Cruz&#x27;s next film was the kid-friendly &quot;G-Force&quot;, voicing a guinea pig spy named Juarez. &quot;G-Force&quot; was a commercial success, making over $290 million worldwide. Also in 2009, she appeared in the film &quot;Broken Embraces&quot; as Lena. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com noted in her review for the film that Cruz &quot;doesn&#x27;t coast on her beauty in &quot;Broken Embraces&quot;, and she has the kind of role that can be difficult to flesh out&quot;. Cruz received nominations from the Satellite Awards and European Film Awards for her performance in &quot;Broken Embraces&quot;. Cruz&#x27;s final 2009 film was the film version of the musical &quot;Nine&quot;, playing the character Carla Albanese, the lead character&#x27;s mistress. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Cruz originally auditioned for the role of the film within a film&#x27;s star, Claudia, which eventually went to Nicole Kidman. Cruz said that she trained for three months for the dance routine in the film. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; commented that while Cruz &quot;does a steamy song and dance&quot;, her &quot;acting is strangely caricatured&quot;. Cruz&#x27;s performance as Carla was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes, and SAG Awards.

===2010–2015: Established actress===
Cruz&#x27;s only film in 2010 was &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot;, the sequel to the 2008 film, in which she appeared as a banker in a cameo role. A commercial success, the comedy film was largely panned by critics. Cruz appeared in her biggest Hollywood turn to date in Rob Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;, the fourth installment of the film series, opposite Johnny Depp. In the film, Cruz portrayed Angelica, a former love interest of Jack Sparrow, who blames him for her corruption. Cruz was the only actress considered for the role, as she fit Marshall&#x27;s description. He invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of &quot;Nine&quot;. The actress spent two months working out and learning fencing for the role. During filming, Cruz discovered she was pregnant, leading the costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic, and the producers to hire her sister Mónica Cruz to double for Penélope in risky scenes. &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot; ranks among the highest-grossing films of all time, grossing more than $1.046 billion in box-office receipts worldwide. On 1 April 2011, prior to the film&#x27;s release, Cruz received the 2,436th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in front of the El Capitan Theatre. She became the first Spanish actress to receive a Star.

In 2012, Cruz appeared in the first ever Nintendo commercial to promote &quot;New Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; and the Nintendo 3DS XL in which she played the role of Mario in the ad. She spoke Italian again, this time in Woody Allen&#x27;s romantic ensemble comedy film &quot;To Rome with Love&quot;, in which she portrayed a street-smart prostitute who agrees to pretend to be the wife of a newlywed. Fond to work with her again, Allen compared Cruz&#x27;s play in the film with that of Italian icons Anna Magnani and Sophia Loren. While the film received mixed reviews, Cruz was reviewed favourably for her &quot;exuberantly, cartoonishly sexy&quot; performance, which &quot;The Week&quot; cited as a stand out. The same year, Cruz also reunited with Italian director Sergio Castellitto in his war tale &quot;Twice Born&quot; about an infertile Italian woman who returns to relive her past in Sarajevo. An adaptation of Castellitto&#x27;s wife Margaret Mazzantini&#x27;s same-titled bestseller, Cruz portrayed the transitional character at different phases in her life, ranging from her early twenties to her late forties. Despite receiving little praise from critics, Cruz&#x27;s performance opposite Emile Hirsch earned positive reviews.

In 2013, Cruz appeared in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Counselor&quot;, featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Michael Fassbender, Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt, and husband Javier Bardem. The crime thriller follows a lawyer who, tempted by the lure of quick money, finds himself involved in drug dealing with ruthless Mexican cartels. Cruz plays his girlfriend, Laura, the only innocent character in the story. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics and became a moderate commercial success at the international box offices. The same year, Cruz, along with Antonio Banderas, made a cameo appearance in Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s farcical comedy &quot;I&#x27;m So Excited&quot;, which marked a return to the director&#x27;s light, campy comedies of the 1980s and 1990s. The film received mixed reviews, but earned a worldwide gross of more than US$11 million.

In 2015, Cruz co-produced and starred in the Spanish drama film &quot;Ma Ma&quot;, directed by Julio Medem. In it, she plays Magda, a gutsy mother and unemployed teacher, who is diagnosed with breast cancer, a role which Cruz later cited as &quot;one of the most complex, beautiful characters I&#x27;ve ever been offered, the most difficult.&quot; The melodrama was screened in the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, where it received generally negative reviews for its weepie story line. However, Cruz was praised for her &quot;aces performance&quot;, which earned her an eighth Goya nomination at the 30th awards ceremony.

===2016–present ===
Cruz&#x27;s first film of 2016 was the American comedy &quot;Zoolander 2&quot;, co-starring and directed by Ben Stiller. In the sequel film, Cruz portrayed a secret Interpol agent who enlists models Derek Zoolander (Stiller) and Hansel McDonald, played by Owen Wilson, to help find out who is killing the world&#x27;s most beautiful people. Specifically written for her persona, Cruz, a fan of the original 2001 film, was one of the first actors to be cast in their parts. Upon its release, the film received generally negative reviews from critics, who felt that it had &quot;more celebrity cameos than laughs.&quot; Cruz&#x27;s other film that year was Louis Leterrier&#x27;s British spy comedy &quot;Grimsby&quot;, in which she played a powerful philanthropist, opposite Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Strong. Cruz was reportedly offered $400,000 for her role. The film received mixed reviews, with critics suggesting that Cruz was highly underused and &quot;looking even less invested here than she did in &quot;Zoolander 2&quot;&quot;. Also in 2016, Cruz rejoined Fernando Trueba on his Spanish-language period pic &quot;The Queen of Spain&quot;, a sequel to Trueba&#x27;s 1998 drama &quot;The Girl of Your Dreams&quot;. Set in the 1950s, twenty years after the events of the original, Cruz reprised the role of an actress who becomes a Hollywood star and returns to Spain to film a blockbuster about Queen Isabella I of Castile. Selected to be shown in the Berlinale Special section of the 67th Berlin International Film Festival, the Spanish comedy drama was screened to lukewarm reviews, but received five nominations at the 31st Goya Awards, earning Cruz her ninth nomination.

&quot;Loving Pablo&quot;, a Spanish drama film directed by Fernando León de Aranoa was released in 2017, starring Cruz in the role of Virginia Vallejo, and her husband, Javier Bardem, in the role of Pablo Escobar. Based on Vallejo&#x27;s bestselling memoir &quot;Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar&quot;, the film was launched to mixed reviews during the 74th Venice International Film Festival. In order to play the role of the Colombian journalist, Cruz studied hundreds of interviews of Vallejo. Cruz had a supporting role in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s mystery film &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (2017), the fourth adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s 1934 novel of the same name. The mystery–drama ensemble film follows world-renowned detective Hercule Poirot, who seeks to solve a murder on the famous European train in the 1930s. Cruz plays missionary and passenger Pilar Estravados, a Hispanic version of the novel&#x27;s Swedish Greta Ohlsson. The film was a financial success but received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with praise for the cast&#x27;s performances, but criticism for not adding anything new to previous adaptations. In 2018, Cruz made her television debut by co-starring in the role of Donatella Versace in the second season of the FX anthology series &quot;American Crime Story&quot; entitled &quot;The Assassination of Gianni Versace&quot;. Her performance was highly praised by critics and she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. In addition, Cruz reteamed with Bardem on the Spanish-language psychological thriller film &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, directed by Asghar Farhadi. The film opened the 2018 Cannes Film Festival to positive reviews. Justin Chang of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the performances from the two leads writing, &quot;Bardem and Cruz have such a natural, unforced chemistry&quot;.

In 2021, Cruz starred alongside Antonio Banderas in Gastón Duprat &amp; Mariano Cohn&#x27;s film &quot;Official Competition&quot; and reunited with Almodóvar for the film &quot;Parallel Mothers&quot;, in which she played Janis, a professional photographer entangled in a relationship with a married man, leading to an affair and resulting in her pregnancy. Both films premiered at the 78th Venice International Film Festival, where the latter received rave reviews. &quot;Parallel Mothers&quot; also screened at the 59th New York Film Festival, where it was received positively. Her performance in the film was lauded, winning the Volpi Cup for Best Actress and receiving her second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, her fourth nomination overall. Stephanie Zacharek from &quot;Time&quot; stated that &quot;Cruz is astonishing here, in what may be the best performance of her career so far. Janis&#x27; fragility and her fortitude are two sides of one coin, and Cruz can shift from one to the other in the merest breath.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; mentioned that &quot;Cruz acts this part with a mood-shifting immediacy that leaves you breathless&quot;, with David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; describing her performance as &quot;one of the best roles of her career&quot; and &quot;her most outstanding work since Volver.&quot; Following the release of these films, she was honoured at the Museum of Modern Art in New York for her career and achievements in film. Luxury fashion house Chanel returned as the presenting sponsor making for an in-sync affair, as Cruz has served as ambassador for the brand since 2018.

The following year, she appeared in the female-led spy action film &quot;The 355&quot;, directed by Simon Kinberg and starring alongside Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyongo, Diane Kruger, Fan Bingbing, Sebastian Stan, and Édgar Ramírez. The film was released by Universal Pictures on 7 January 2022. Also in 2022, Cruz acted in Emanuele Crialese&#x27;s Italian drama film &quot;L&#x27;immensità&quot; and Juan Diego Botto&#x27;s Spanish thriller &quot;On the Fringe&quot; the later of which she also served as a producer. Guy Lodge of &quot;Variety&quot; praised her performance in &quot;L&#x27;immensità&quot; writing, &quot;If it was through the lens of Pedro Almodóvar that Cruz really established herself as her generation’s stand-in for Sophia Loren, Crialese takes the likeness one step further, planting the Spaniard in Loren’s hometown of Rome, as the kind of beautifully wounded housewife that the Italian icon perfected in the films of Crialese’s youth.&quot; She portrayed Laura, Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s wife, alongside Adam Driver and Shailene Woodley in the biopic &quot;Ferrari&quot;, directed by Michael Mann. The film chronicled the life of Enzo Ferrari, founder of the Ferrari brand.

In 2023, Cruz became a brand ambassador for Emirates appearing in advertisements for the airline, as well as Geox. As a part of a collaboration with performer Residente and Sílvia Pérez Cruz on the track &quot;313&quot;, Cruz won a Latin Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video in 2024.

In 2006, Cruz became a spokesmodel for French cosmetics company L&#x27;Oréal to promote products such as the L&#x27;Oréal Paris hair dye Natural Match and L&#x27;Oreal mascara products. She receives $2 million a year for her work for the company. Cruz has appeared in print ads for Mango and had a contract with Ralph Lauren in 2001. Cruz and her sister designed their second collection for Mango in 2007. It was inspired by Brigitte Bardot and summers in St Tropez.

Cruz ranked as No. 58 in &quot;Maxim&quot; &quot;Hot 100&quot; of 2007 list, and was chosen by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as being one of the 100 Sexiest Movie Stars in the world. Cruz was also ranked on Askmen.com&#x27;s Most Desirable Women of 2008 at No. 26, in 2009 at No. 25, and in 2010 at No. 7. In April 2010, she replaced Kate Winslet as the new face and ambassador of Lancôme&#x27;s Trésor fragrance. Lancôme signed Cruz as their third superstar spokesmodel, along with Julia Roberts and Winslet. The campaign was shot by Mario Testino at Paris&#x27;s Hotel de Crillon and debuted in the autumn of 2010.

In 2010, Cruz was a guest editor for the French &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, focusing on larger-size models in a provocative photo shoot. Almodóvar described her as his muse. On the cover of Spanish &quot;Vogue&quot;″s December 2010 issue, she agreed to be photographed by fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh only if her pregnancy was not shown. In 2011, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported the most sought after body parts of the rich and famous revealed by two Hollywood plastic surgeons who carried out a survey among their patients to build up the picture of the perfect woman. Under the category of the most sought after body shape, Cruz, known for her voluptuous figure, was voted as having the top body. &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; ranked her at No. 32. on their &quot;100 Hottest Women of All-Time&quot; list. &quot;Esquire&quot; named her the Sexiest Woman Alive in 2014. In May 2023, she was appointed as the brand ambassador for Emirates Airline.

==Philanthropy==
Cruz has donated money and time to charity. In addition to work in Nepal, she has volunteered in Uganda and India, where she spent a week working with Mother Teresa that included assisting in a leprosy clinic. That trip inspired Cruz to help start a foundation to support homeless girls in India, where she sponsors two young women. She donated her salary from her first Hollywood film, &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot;, to Mother Teresa&#x27;s mission. In the early 2000s, she spent time in Nepal photographing Tibetan children for an exhibition attended by the Dalai Lama. She also photographed residents at the Pacific Lodge Boys&#x27; Home, most of whom are former gang members and recovering substance abusers. She said: &quot;These kids break my heart. I have to control myself not to cry. Not out of pity, but seeing how tricky life is and how hard it is to make the right choices.&quot; A pregnant Cruz showed her support for the battle against AIDS by lighting up the Empire State Building with red lights in New York City on 1 December 2010 on International AIDS Day, as part of (RED)&#x27;s new awareness campaign, &#x27;An AIDS Free Generation is Due in 2015,&#x27; which aims to eradicate the HIV virus from pregnant mothers to their babies. In 2012 and 2018, she posed for ads supporting PETA&#x27;s anti-fur campaign.

<doc id="23008" wikidata="Q18536127" url="?curid=23008" title="Preliminary hearing">
<text>In common law jurisdictions, a preliminary hearing, preliminary examination, preliminary inquiry, evidentiary hearing or probable cause hearing is a proceeding, after a criminal complaint has been filed by the prosecutor, to determine whether there is enough evidence to require a trial. At such a hearing, the defendant may be assisted by a lawyer.

==Canada==
In Canada, a preliminary hearing is sometimes referred to as a preliminary inquiry. During the preliminary inquiry, a hearing is held by the court to determine if there is enough evidence to justify a trial. Preliminary inquiries are only held when a person is charged with an indictable offence where the accused in liable to a period of imprisonment greater than 14 years. The Crown Attorney may call witnesses. If there is not enough evidence, the court will dismiss the charge(s).

In the aftermath of the 2016 Jordan decision, in which the Supreme Court of Canada imposed time limits on the Crown to bring criminal cases to trial, the Crown has started to use the direct indictment procedure more frequently.

==United Kingdom==

===Scotland===
In Scotland, a preliminary hearing is a non-evidential pre-trial diet in cases to be tried before the High Court of Justiciary, conducted to enable the court to determine whether both parties, the prosecution and the defence, are ready to proceed to trial. The hearing may also address ancillary procedural matters.

==United States==
In the United States, at a preliminary hearing the judge must find that such evidence provides probable cause to believe that the crime was committed and that the crime was committed by the defendant. There is a right to counsel at the preliminary hearing.

The conduct of the preliminary hearing as well as the specific rules regarding the admissibility of evidence vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If the court decides that there is probable cause, a formal charging instrument (called the information in some jurisdictions) will be issued, and the prosecution will continue. If the court does not find probable cause, then typically the prosecution will cease. Many jurisdictions, however, allow the prosecution to seek a new preliminary hearing or to seek a bill of indictment from a grand jury.

The key questions normally addressed at a preliminary hearing are:

#Is there probable cause to believe the alleged crime occurred, and did it occur within the court&#x27;s jurisdiction?
#Is there probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime?

If a judge determines that there is sufficient evidence to believe that the defendant committed the crime, then it is said that the defendant is &quot;bound over&quot;.

===Terminology===
In criminal prosecutions, the court schedules an arraignment at which the charges are formally presented to the defendant. Several procedures must be done before the arraignment can happen. For example, in most states, the prosecutor first files an “information” document with the court. This filing describes the basic elements (the facts or factors) that make up the alleged criminal offense. Relatedly, the filing enumerates the criminal law(s) that the defendant allegedly violated. Finally, the defendant is scheduled for an arraignment which is when the charge is formally and openly presented. If the defendant pleads not guilty at the arraignment, the court schedules a preliminary hearing.

Where an indictment is obtained through means other than an information document, such as through grand jury proceedings or after an arrest when the defendant is first brought to court, the arraignment may be referred to as an &quot;initial hearing&quot;, or &quot;preliminary arraignment&quot;, which is different from a preliminary hearing. Those other hearings are not probable cause hearings.

===State law===
A preliminary hearing is not always required, and some jurisdictions do not require it. Some states hold preliminary hearings in every serious criminal case. Other states only have a preliminary hearing if the defense requests it; Alternatively, some states only have them for felony cases.

===Federal law===
If the defendant is charged with a felony under federal law, the defendant has the right to an indictment by a grand jury, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and Title 18 of the United States Code. At grand jury proceedings, the defendant is not entitled to have counsel present in the grand jury room (although witnesses may consult with counsel outside of the presence of the grand jury). In some cases, the defendant may not even know that a grand jury is considering the case.

<doc id="23010" wikidata="Q57089" url="?curid=23010" title="Paul Ehrlich">
<text>Paul Ehrlich (; 14 March 1854 – 20 August 1915) was a Nobel Prize-winning German physician and scientist who worked in the fields of hematology, immunology and antimicrobial chemotherapy. Among his foremost achievements were finding a cure for syphilis in 1909 and inventing an important modification of the technique for Gram staining bacteria. The methods he developed for staining tissue made it possible to distinguish between different types of blood cells, which led to the ability to diagnose numerous blood diseases.

His laboratory discovered arsphenamine (Salvarsan), the first antibiotic and first effective medicinal treatment for syphilis, thereby initiating and also naming the concept of chemotherapy. Ehrlich introduced the concept of a magic bullet. He also made a decisive contribution to the development of an antiserum to combat diphtheria and conceived a method for standardising therapeutic serums.

In 1908, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to immunology. He was the founder and first director of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, a German research institution and medical regulatory body named for him in 1947, that is the nation&#x27;s federal institute for vaccines and biomedicines. A genus of Rickettsiales bacteria, &quot;Ehrlichia&quot;, is named after him.

Ehrlich has been called &quot;father of immunology&quot;.

==Life and career==
Ehrlich was born 14 March 1854 in Strehlen in the Prussian province of Lower Silesia (south-west Poland). He was the second child of Rosa (Weigert) and Ismar Ehrlich, the leader of the local Jewish community. His father was an innkeeper and distiller of liqueurs and the royal lottery collector in Strehlen, a town of some 5,000 inhabitants. His grandfather, Heymann Ehrlich, had been a fairly successful distiller and tavern manager. Ehrlich was the uncle of Fritz Weigert and cousin of Karl Weigert.

After elementary school, Paul attended the time-honoured secondary school Maria-Magdalenen-Gymnasium in Breslau, where he met Albert Neisser, who later became a colleague. As a schoolboy (inspired by his cousin Karl Weigert who owned one of the first microtomes), he became fascinated by the process of staining microscopic tissue substances. He retained that interest during his subsequent medical studies at the universities of Breslau, Strasbourg, Freiburg im Breisgau and Leipzig. After obtaining his doctorate in 1882, he worked at the Charité in Berlin as an assistant medical director under Theodor Frerichs, the founder of experimental clinical medicine, focusing on histology, hematology and colour chemistry (dyes).

He married Hedwig Pinkus (1864–1948) in 1883 in the synagogue in Neustadt (Prudnik, Poland). The couple had two daughters, Stephanie and Marianne. Hedwig was a sister of Max Pinkus, who was an owner of the textile factory in Neustadt (later known as ZPB &quot;Frotex&quot;). He settled in the villa of the Fränkel family on Wiesenerstrasse in Neustadt.

After completing his clinical education and habilitation at the prominent Charité medical school and teaching hospital in Berlin in 1886, Ehrlich travelled to Egypt and other countries in 1888 and 1889, in part to cure a case of tuberculosis which he had contracted in the laboratory. Upon his return he established a private medical practice and small laboratory in Berlin-Steglitz. In 1891, Robert Koch invited Ehrlich to join the staff at his Berlin Institute of Infectious Diseases, where in 1896 a new branch, the Institute for Serum Research and Testing (&quot;Institut für Serumforschung und Serumprüfung&quot;), was established for Ehrlich&#x27;s specialisation. Ehrlich was named its founding director.

In 1899 his institute moved to Frankfurt am Main and was renamed the Institute of Experimental Therapy (&quot;Institut für experimentelle Therapie&quot;). One of his important collaborators there was Max Neisser. In 1904, Ehrlich received a full position of honorary professor from the University of Göttingen. In 1906 Ehrlich became the director of the Georg Speyer House in Frankfurt, a private research foundation affiliated with his institute. Here he discovered in 1909 the first drug to be targeted against a specific pathogen: Salvarsan, a treatment for syphilis, which was at that time one of the most lethal and infectious diseases in Europe. In 1914, Ehrlich was awarded the Cameron Prize of the University of Edinburgh. Among the foreign guest scientists working with Ehrlich at his institute were two Nobel Prize winners, Henry Hallett Dale and Paul Karrer. The institute was renamed Paul Ehrlich Institute in Ehrlich&#x27;s honour in 1947.

In 1914, Ehrlich signed the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three which was a defence of Germany&#x27;s World War I politics and militarism. On 17 August 1915 Ehrlich suffered a heart attack and died on 20 August in Bad Homburg vor der Höhe. Wilhelm II the German emperor, wrote in a telegram of condolence, &quot;I, along with the entire civilized world, mourn the death of this meritorious researcher for his great service to medical science and suffering humanity; his life’s work ensures undying fame and the gratitude of both his contemporaries and posterity&quot;.

Ehrlich was buried at the Old Jewish Cemetery, Frankfurt (Block 114 N).

==Research==
===Hematological staining===
In the early 1870s, Ehrlich&#x27;s cousin Karl Weigert was the first person to stain bacteria with dyes and to introduce aniline pigments for histological studies and bacterial diagnostics. During his studies in Strassburg under the anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer, Ehrlich continued the research started by his cousin in dyes and staining tissues for microscopic study. He spent his eighth university semester in Freiburg im Breisgau investigating primarily the red dye dahlia (monophenylrosanilin), giving rise to his first publication.

In 1878 he followed his dissertation supervisor Julius Friedrich Cohnheim to Leipzig, and obtained a doctorate with a dissertation entitled &quot;Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Histological Staining&quot; (&quot;Beiträge zur Theorie und Praxis der histologischen Färbung&quot;).

One of the most outstanding results of his dissertation investigations was the discovery of a new cell type. Ehrlich discovered in the protoplasm of supposed plasma cells a granulate which could be made visible with the help of an alkaline dye. He thought this granulate was a sign of good nourishment, and accordingly named these cells mast cells, (from the German word for an animal-fattening feed, &quot;Mast&quot;). This focus on chemistry was unusual for a medical dissertation. In it, Ehrlich presented the entire spectrum of known staining techniques and the chemistry of the pigments employed.
While he was at the Charité, Ehrlich elaborated upon the differentiation of white blood cells according to their different granules. A precondition was a dry specimen technique, which he also developed. A drop of blood placed between two glass slides and heated over a Bunsen burner fixed the blood cells while still allowing them to be stained. Ehrlich used both alkaline and acid dyes, and also created new &quot;neutral&quot; dyes. For the first time this made it possible to differentiate the lymphocytes among the leucocytes (white blood cells). By studying their granulation he could distinguish between nongranular lymphocytes, mono- and poly-nuclear leucocytes, eosinophil granulocytes and mast cells.

Starting in 1880, Ehrlich also studied red blood cells. He demonstrated the existence of nucleated red blood cells, which he subdivided into normoblasts, megaloblasts, microblasts and poikiloblasts; he had discovered the precursors of erythrocytes. Ehrlich thus also laid the basis for the analysis of anemias, after he had created the basis for systematising leukemias with his investigation of white blood cells.

His duties at the Charité included analysing patients&#x27; blood and urine specimens. In 1881 he published a new urine test which could be used to distinguish different types of typhoid from simple cases of diarrhea. The intensity of staining made possible a disease prognosis. The pigment solution he used became known as Ehrlich&#x27;s reagent.
Ehrlich&#x27;s great achievement, but also a source of problems during his further career, was that he had initiated a new field of study interrelating chemistry, biology and medicine. Much of his work was rejected by the medical profession, which lacked the requisite chemical knowledge. It also meant that there was no suitable professorship in sight for Ehrlich.

===Serum research===
====Friendship with Robert Koch====
When a student in Breslau, Ehrlich was given an opportunity by the pathologist Julius Friedrich Cohnheim to conduct extensive research and was also introduced to Robert Koch, who was at the time a district physician in Wollstein, Posen Province. In his spare time, Koch had clarified the life cycle of the anthrax pathogen and had contacted Ferdinand Cohn, who was quickly convinced by Koch&#x27;s work and introduced him to his Breslau colleagues. From 30 April to 2 May 1876, Koch presented his investigations in Breslau, which the student Ehrlich was able to attend.

On 24 March 1882, Ehrlich was present when Koch, working since 1880 at the Imperial Public Health Office (&quot;Kaiserliches Gesundheitsamt&quot;) in Berlin, presented the lecture in which he reported how he was able to identify the tuberculosis pathogen. Ehrlich later described this lecture as his &quot;greatest experience in science&quot;. The day after Koch&#x27;s lecture, Ehrlich had already made an improvement to Koch&#x27;s staining method, which Koch unreservedly welcomed. From this date on, the two men were bound in friendship.

In 1887 Ehrlich became an unsalaried lecturer in internal medicine (&quot;Privatdozent für Innere Medizin&quot;) at Berlin University, and in 1890 took over the tuberculosis station at a public hospital in Berlin-Moabit at Koch&#x27;s request. This was where Koch&#x27;s hoped-for tuberculosis therapeutic agent tuberculin was under study; and Ehrlich had even injected himself with it. In the ensuing tuberculin scandal, Ehrlich tried to support Koch and stressed the value of tuberculin for diagnostic purposes. In 1891 Koch invited Ehrlich to work at the newly founded &quot;Institut für Infektionskrankheiten&quot; (Institute of Infectious Diseases, which became the Robert Koch Institute) at &quot;Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität&quot; (Humboldt University) in Berlin. Koch was unable to give him any remuneration, but did offer him full access to laboratory staff, patients, chemicals and laboratory animals, which Ehrlich always remembered with gratitude.

====First work on immunity====
Ehrlich had started his first experiments on immunisation already in his private laboratory. He accustomed mice to the poisons ricin and abrin. After feeding them with small but increasing dosages of ricin he ascertained that they had become &quot;ricin-proof&quot;. Ehrlich interpreted this as immunisation and observed that it was abruptly initiated after a few days and was still in existence after several months, but mice immunised against ricin were just as sensitive to abrin as untreated animals.

This was followed by investigations on the &quot;inheritance&quot; of acquired immunity. It was already known that in some cases after a smallpox or syphilis infection, specific immunity was transmitted from the parents to their offspring. Ehrlich rejected inheritance in the genetic sense because the offspring of a male mouse immunised against abrin and an untreated female mouse were not immune to abrin. He concluded that the foetus was supplied with antibodies via the pulmonary circulation of the mother. This idea was supported by the fact that this &quot;inherited immunity&quot; decreased after a few months. In another experiment he exchanged the offspring of treated and untreated female mice. The mice which were nursed by the treated females were protected from the poison, providing the proof that antibodies can also be conveyed in milk.

Ehrlich also researched autoimmunity, but he specifically rejected the possibility that an organism&#x27;s immune system could attack the organism&#x27;s own tissue calling it &quot;horror autotoxicus&quot;. It was Ehrlich&#x27;s student, Ernest Witebsky, who demonstrated that autoimmunity could cause disease in humans. Ehrlich was the first to propose that regulatory mechanisms existed to protect an organism from autoimmunity, saying in 1906 that &quot;the organism possesses certain contrivances by means of which the immunity reaction, so easily produced by all kinds of cells, is prevented from acting against the organism&#x27;s own elements&quot;.

====Work with Behring on a diphtheria serum====
Emil Behring had worked at the Berlin Institute of Infectious Diseases until 1893 on developing an antiserum for treating diphtheria and tetanus but with inconsistent results. Koch suggested that Behring and Ehrlich cooperate on the project. This joint work was successful to the extent that Ehrlich was quickly able to increase the level of immunity of the laboratory animals based on his experience with mice. Clinical tests with diphtheria serum early in 1894 were successful and in August the chemical company Hoechst started to market Behring&#x27;s &quot;Diphtheria Remedy synthesised by Behring-Ehrlich&quot;. The two discoverers had originally agreed to share any profits after the Hoechst share had been subtracted. Their contract was changed several times and finally Ehrlich was eventually pressured into accepting a profit share of only eight percent. Ehrlich resented what he considered as unfair treatment, and his relationship with Behring was thereafter problematic, a situation which later escalated over the issue of the valency of tetanus serum. Ehrlich recognised that the principle of serum therapy had been developed by Behring and Kitasato. But he was of the opinion that he had been the first to develop a serum which could also be used on humans, and that his role in developing the diphtheria serum had been insufficiently acknowledged. Behring, for his part, schemed against Ehrlich at the Prussian Ministry of Culture, and from 1900 on Ehrlich refused to collaborate with him. Von Behring was the sole recipient of the first Nobel Prize in Medicine, in 1901, for contributions to research on diphtheria.

====The valency of serums====

Since antiserums were an entirely new type of medicine whose quality was highly variable, a government system was established to guarantee their safety and effectiveness. Beginning 1 April 1895, only government-approved serum could be sold in the German Reich. The testing station for diphtheria serum was provisionally housed at the Institute of Infectious Diseases. At the initiative of Friedrich Althoff, an Institute of Serum Research and Testing (&quot;Institut für Serumforschung und Serumprüfung&quot;) was established in 1896 in Berlin-Steglitz, with Ehrlich as director (which required him to cancel all his contracts with Hoechst). In this function and as honorary professor at Berliner University he had annual earnings of 6,000 marks, approximately the salary of a university professor. In addition to a testing department the institute had a research department.

In order to determine the effectiveness of diphtheria antiserum, a stable concentration of diphtheria toxin was required. Ehrlich discovered that the toxin being used was perishable, in contrast to what had been assumed, which for him led to two consequences: he did not use the toxin as a standard, but instead a serum powder developed by Behring, which had to be dissolved in liquid shortly before use. The strength of a test toxin was first determined in comparison with this standard. The test toxin could then be used as a reference for testing other serums. For the test itself, toxin and serum were mixed in a ratio so that their effects just cancelled each other when injected into a guinea pig. But since there was a large margin in determining whether symptoms of illness were present, Ehrlich established an unambiguous target: the death of the animal. The mixture was to be such that the test animal would die after four days. If it died earlier, the serum was too weak and was rejected. Ehrlich claimed to have made the determination of the valency of serum as accurate as it would be with chemical titration. This again demonstrates his tendency to quantify the life sciences.

Influenced by the mayor of Frankfurt am Main, Franz Adickes, who endeavored to establish science institutions in Frankfurt in preparation of the founding of a university, Ehrlich&#x27;s institute moved to Frankfurt in 1899 and was renamed the Royal Prussian Institute of Experimental Therapy (&quot;Königlich Preußisches Institut für Experimentelle Therapie&quot;). The German quality-control methodology was copied by government serum institutes all over the world, and they also obtained the standard serum from Frankfurt. After diphtheria antiserum, tetanus serum and various bactericide serums for use in veterinary medicine were developed in rapid sequence. These were also evaluated at the institute, as was tuberculin and later on various vaccines. Ehrlich&#x27;s most important colleague at the institute was the Jewish physician and biologist Julius Morgenroth.

====Ehrlich&#x27;s side-chain theory====
Ehrlich postulated that cell protoplasm contains structures which have chemical &quot;side chains&quot; (macromolecules) to which the toxin binds, affecting function. If the organism survives the effects of the toxin, the blocked side-chains are replaced by new ones. This regeneration can be trained, the name for this phenomenon being &quot;immunisation&quot;. If the cell produces a surplus of side chains, these might also be released into the blood as antibodies.

In the following years Ehrlich expanded his side chain theory using concepts (&quot;amboceptors&quot;, &quot;receptors of the first, second and third order&quot;, etc.) which are no longer customary. Between the antigen and the antibody he assumed there was an additional immune molecule, which he called an &quot;additive&quot; or a &quot;complement&quot;. For him, the side chain contained at least two functional groups.

For providing a theoretical basis for immunology as well as for his work on serum valency, Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1908 together with Élie Metchnikoff. Metchnikoff, who had researched the cellular branch of immunity, Phagocytosis, at the Pasteur Institute had previously sharply attacked Ehrlich.

===Cancer research===
In 1901, the Prussian Ministry of Finance criticised Ehrlich for exceeding his budget and as a consequence reduced his income. In this situation Althoff arranged a contact with Georg Speyer, a Jewish philanthropist and joint owner of the bank house Lazard Speyer-Ellissen. The cancerous disease of Princess Victoria, the widow of the German Emperor Friedrich III, had received much public attention and prompted a collection among wealthy Frankfurt citizens, including Speyer, in support of cancer research. Ehrlich had also received from the German Emperor Wilhelm II a personal request to devote all his energy to cancer research. Such efforts led to the founding of a department for cancer research affiliated with the Institute of Experimental Therapy. The chemist Gustav Embden, among others, worked there. Ehrlich informed his sponsors that cancer research meant basic research, and that a cure could not be expected soon.

Among the results achieved by Ehrlich and his research colleagues was the insight that when tumors are cultivated by transplanting tumor cells, their malignancy increases from generation to generation. If the primary tumor is removed, then metastasis precipitously increases. Ehrlich applied bacteriological methods to cancer research. In analogy to vaccination, he attempted to generate immunity to cancer by injecting weakened cancer cells. Both in cancer research and chemotherapy research (see below) he introduced the methodologies of Big Science.

===Chemotherapy===
====In vivo staining====
In 1885 Ehrlich&#x27;s monograph &quot;The Need of the Organism for Oxygen&quot; (&quot;Das Sauerstoffbedürfnis des Organismus – Eine farbenanalytische Studie&quot;) appeared, which he also submitted as a habilitation thesis. In it he introduced the new technology of in vivo staining. One of his findings was that pigments can only be easily assimilated by living organisms if they are in granular form. He injected the dyes alizarin blue and indophenol blue into laboratory animals and established after their death that various organs had been coloured to different degrees. In organs with high oxygen saturation, indophenol was retained; in organs with medium saturation, indophenol was reduced, but not alizarin blue. And in areas with low oxygen saturation, both pigments were reduced. With this work, Ehrlich also formulated the conviction which guided his research: that all life processes can be traced to processes of physical chemistry occurring in the cell.

====Methylene blue====
In the course of his investigations Ehrlich came across methylene blue, which he regarded as particularly suitable for staining bacteria. Later, Robert Koch also used methylene blue as a dye in his research on the tuberculosis pathogen. In Ehrlich&#x27;s view, an added benefit was that methylene blue also stained the long appendages of nerve cells, the axons. He initiated a doctoral dissertation on the subject, but did not follow up the topic himself. It was the opinion of the neurologist Ludwig Edinger that Ehrlich had thereby opened up a major new topic in the field of neurology.

After mid-1889, when Ehrlich was unemployed, he privately continued his research on methylene blue. His work on in vivo staining gave him the idea of using it therapeutically. Since the parasite family of &quot;Plasmodiidae&quot; – which includes the malaria pathogen – can be stained with methylene blue, he thought it could possibly be used in the treatment of malaria. In the case of two patients so treated at the city hospital in Berlin-Moabit, their fever indeed subsided and the malaria plasmodia disappeared from their blood. Ehrlich obtained methylene blue from the company Meister Lucius &amp; Brüning AG (later renamed Hoechst AG), which started a long collaboration with this company.

====The search for a &quot;chemotherapia specifica&quot;====
Before the Institute of Experimental Therapy had moved to Frankfurt, Ehrlich had already resumed work on methylene blue. After the death of Georg Speyer, his widow Franziska Speyer endowed the Georg-Speyer House in his memory which was erected next door to Ehrlich&#x27;s institute. As director of the Georg-Speyer House, Ehrlich transferred his chemotherapeutic research there. He was looking for an agent which was as effective as methylene blue, but without its side effects. His model was on the one hand the impact of quinine on malaria, and on the other hand, in analogy to serum therapy, he thought there must also be chemical pharmaceuticals which would have just as specific an effect on individual diseases. His goal was to find a &quot;Therapia sterilisans magna&quot;, in other words a treatment that could kill all disease pathogens.

As a model for experimental therapy Ehrlich used a guinea pig disease trypanosoma and tested out various chemical substances on laboratory animals. The trypanosomes could indeed be successfully killed with the dye trypan red. Beginning in 1906, he intensively investigated atoxyl and had it tested by Robert Koch along with other arsenic compounds during Koch&#x27;s sleeping sickness expedition of 1906/07. Although the name literally means &quot;nonpoisonous&quot;, atoxyl does cause damage, especially to the optic nerve. Ehrlich elaborated the systematic testing of chemical compounds in the sense of screening as later practiced in the pharmaceutical industry. He discovered that Compound 418 - Arsenophenylglycine - had an impressive therapeutic effect and had it tested in Africa.

With the support of his assistant Sahachiro Hata Ehrlich discovered in 1909 that Compound 606, Arsphenamine, effectively combatted &quot;spirillum&quot; spirochaetes bacteria, one of whose subspecies causes syphilis. The compound proved to have few side effects in human trials, and the spirochetes disappeared in seven syphilis patients after this treatment.

After extensive clinical testing (all the research participants had the negative example of tuberculin in mind) the Hoechst company began to market the compound toward the end of 1910 under the name Salvarsan. This was the first agent with a specific therapeutic effect to be created on the basis of theoretical considerations. Salvarsan proved to be amazingly effective, particularly when compared with the conventional therapy of mercury salts. Manufactured by Hoechst AG, Salvarsan became the most widely prescribed drug in the world. It was the most effective drug for treating syphilis until penicillin became available in the 1940s. Salvarsan required improvement as to side effects and solubility and was replaced in 1911 with Neosalvarsan. Ehrlich&#x27;s work illuminated the existence of the blood-brain barrier, although he himself never believed in such a barrier, with Lina Stern later coining the phrase.

The medication triggered the so-called &quot;Salvarsan war&quot;. On one side there was hostility on the part of those who feared a resulting moral breakdown of sexual inhibitions. Ehrlich was also accused, with clearly anti-Semitic undertones, of excessively enriching himself. In addition, Ehrlich&#x27;s associate, Paul Uhlenhuth claimed priority in discovering the drug.

Because some people died during the clinical testing, Ehrlich was accused of &quot;stopping at nothing.&quot; In 1914, one of the most prominent accusers was convicted of criminal libel at a trial for which Ehrlich was called to testify. Though Ehrlich was thereby exonerated, the ordeal threw him into a depression from which he never fully recovered.

===Magic bullet===
Ehrlich reasoned that if a compound could be made that selectively targeted a disease-causing organism, then a toxin for that organism could be delivered along with the agent of selectivity. Hence, a &quot;magic bullet&quot; (&quot;Zauberkugel&quot;, his term for an ideal therapeutic agent) would be created that killed only the organism targeted. The concept of a &quot;magic bullet&quot; has to some extent been realised by the development of antibody-drug conjugates (a monoclonal antibody linked to a cytotoxic biologically active drug), as they enable cytotoxic drugs to be selectively delivered to their designated targets (e.g. cancer cells).

==Legacy==
In 1910, a street was named after Ehrlich in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen. In Nazi Germany, Ehrlich&#x27;s achievements were ignored while Emil Adolf von Behring was stylised as the ideal Aryan scientist, and the street named after Ehrlich was given another name. Shortly after the end of the war the name Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse was reinstated, and numerous German cities have since had streets named after Ehrlich.

West Germany issued a postage stamp in 1954 on the 100th anniversary of the births of Ehrlich (14 March 1854) and Emil von Behring (15 March 1854).

The 200 Deutsche Mark bank note, issued until 2001, featured Ehrlich.

The German Paul Ehrlich Institute, the successor to the Steglitz Institute for Serum Research and Serum Testing and the Frankfurt Royal Institute for Experimental Therapy, was named in 1947 after Ehrlich, its first director.

Ehrlich&#x27;s name is also borne by many schools and pharmacies, by the Paul-Ehrlich-Gesellschaft für Chemotherapie e. V. (PEG) in Frankfurt am Main, and the Paul-Ehrlich-Klinik in Bad Homburg vor der Höhe. The Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize is the most distinguished German award for biomedical research. A European network of PhD studies in Medicinal Chemistry has been named after him (Paul Ehrlich MedChem Euro PhD Network).

The Anti-Defamation League awards a Paul Ehrlich–Günther K. Schwerin Human Rights Prize.

A crater of the moon was named after Ehrlich in 1970.

Ehrlich&#x27;s life and work was featured in the 1940 U.S. film &quot;Dr. Ehrlich&#x27;s Magic Bullet&quot; with Edward G. Robinson in the title role. It focused on Salvarsan (arsphenamine, &quot;compound 606&quot;), his cure for syphilis. Since the Nazi government was opposed to this tribute to a Jewish scientist, attempts were made to keep the film a secret in Germany. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

<text>Philosophical methodology encompasses the methods used to philosophize and the study of these methods. Methods of philosophy are procedures for conducting research, creating new theories, and selecting between competing theories. In addition to the description of methods, philosophical methodology also compares and evaluates them.

Philosophers have employed a great variety of methods. Methodological skepticism tries to find principles that cannot be doubted. The geometrical method deduces theorems from self-evident axioms. The phenomenological method describes first-person experience. Verificationists study the conditions of empirical verification of sentences to determine their meaning. Conceptual analysis decomposes concepts into fundamental constituents. Common-sense philosophers use widely held beliefs as their starting point of inquiry, whereas ordinary language philosophers extract philosophical insights from ordinary language. Intuition-based methods, like thought experiments, rely on non-inferential impressions. The method of reflective equilibrium seeks coherence among beliefs, while the pragmatist method assesses theories by their practical consequences. The transcendental method studies the conditions without which an entity could not exist. Experimental philosophers use empirical methods.

The choice of method can significantly impact how theories are constructed and the arguments used to support them. As a result, methodological disagreements can lead to philosophical disagreements.

== Definition ==
The term &quot;philosophical methodology&quot; refers either to the methods used to philosophize or to the branch of metaphilosophy studying these methods. A method is a way of doing things, such as a set of actions or decisions, in order to achieve a certain goal, when used under the right conditions. In the context of inquiry, a method is a way of conducting one&#x27;s research and theorizing, like inductive or axiomatic methods in logic or experimental methods in the sciences. Philosophical methodology studies the methods of philosophy. It is not primarily concerned with whether a philosophical position, such as metaphysical dualism or utilitarianism, is true or false. Instead, it asks how one can determine which position should be adopted.

In the widest sense, any principle for choosing between competing theories may be considered as part of the methodology of philosophy. In this sense, the philosophical methodology is &quot;the general study of criteria for theory selection&quot;. For example, Occam’s Razor is a methodological principle of theory selection favoring simple over complex theories. A closely related aspect of philosophical methodology concerns the question of which conventions one needs to adopt necessarily to succeed at theory making. But in a more narrow sense, only guidelines that help philosophers learn about facts studied by philosophy qualify as philosophical methods. This is the more common sense, which applies to most of the methods listed in this article. In this sense, philosophical methodology is closely related to epistemology in that it consists in epistemological methods that enable philosophers to arrive at knowledge. Because of this, the problem of the methods of philosophy is central to how philosophical claims are to be justified.

An important difference in philosophical methodology concerns the distinction between descriptive and normative questions. Descriptive questions ask what methods philosophers &quot;actually use or used&quot; in the past, while normative questions ask what methods they &quot;should use&quot;. The normative aspect of philosophical methodology expresses the idea that there is a difference between good and bad philosophy. In this sense, philosophical methods either articulate the standards of evaluation themselves or the practices that ensure that these standards are met. Philosophical methods can be understood as tools that help the theorist do &quot;good&quot; philosophy and arrive at knowledge. The normative question of philosophical methodology is quite controversial since different schools of philosophy often have very different views on what constitutes good philosophy and how to achieve it.

== Methods ==
A great variety of philosophical methods has been proposed. Some of these methods were developed as a reaction to other methods, for example, to counter skepticism by providing a secure path to knowledge. In other cases, one method may be understood as a development or a specific application of another method. Some philosophers or philosophical movements give primacy to one specific method, while others use a variety of methods depending on the problem they are trying to solve. It has been argued that many of the philosophical methods are also commonly used implicitly in more crude forms by regular people and are only given a more careful, critical, and systematic exposition in philosophical methodology.

=== Methodological skepticism ===
Methodological skepticism, also referred to as Cartesian doubt, uses systematic doubt as a method of philosophy. It is motivated by the search for an absolutely certain foundation of knowledge. The method for finding these foundations is doubt: only that which is indubitable can serve this role. While this approach has been influential, it has also received various criticisms. One problem is that it has proven very difficult to find such absolutely certain claims if the doubt is applied in its most radical form. Another is that while absolute certainty may be desirable, it is by no means necessary for knowledge. In this sense, it excludes too much and seems to be unwarranted and arbitrary, since it is not clear why very certain theorems justified by strong arguments should be abandoned just because they are not absolutely certain. This can be seen in relation to the insights discovered by the empirical sciences, which have proven very useful even though they are not indubitable.

=== Geometrical method ===
The geometrical method came to particular prominence through rationalists like Baruch Spinoza. It starts from a small set of self-evident axioms together with relevant definitions and tries to deduce a great variety of theorems from this basis, thereby mirroring the methods found in geometry. Historically, it can be understood as a response to methodological skepticism: it consists in trying to find a foundation of certain knowledge and then expanding this foundation through deductive inferences. The theorems arrived at this way may be challenged in two ways. On the one hand, they may be derived from axioms that are not as self-evident as their defenders proclaim and thereby fail to inherit the status of absolute certainty. For example, many philosophers have rejected the claim of self-evidence concerning one of René Descartes&#x27;s first principles stating that &quot;he can know that whatever he perceives clearly and distinctly is true only if he first knows that God exists and is not a deceiver&quot;. Another example is the causal axiom of Spinoza&#x27;s system that &quot;the knowledge of an effect depends on and involves knowledge of its cause&quot;, which has been criticized in various ways. In this sense, philosophical systems built using the geometrical method are open to criticisms that reject their basic axioms. A different form of objection holds that the inference from the axioms to the theorems may be faulty, for example, because it does not follow a rule of inference or because it includes implicitly assumed premises that are not themselves self-evident.

=== Phenomenological method ===
Phenomenology is the science of appearances - broadly speaking, the science of phenomenon, given that almost all phenomena are perceived. The phenomenological method aims to study the appearances themselves and the relations found between them. This is achieved through the so-called phenomenological reduction, also known as epoché or bracketing: the researcher suspends their judgments about the natural external world in order to focus exclusively on the experience of how things appear to be, independent of whether these appearances are true or false. One idea behind this approach is that our presuppositions of what things are like can get in the way of studying how they appear to be and thereby mislead the researcher into thinking they know the answer instead of looking for themselves. The phenomenological method can also be seen as a reaction to methodological skepticism since its defenders traditionally claimed that it could lead to absolute certainty and thereby help philosophy achieve the status of a rigorous science. But phenomenology has been heavily criticized because of this overly optimistic outlook concerning the certainty of its insights. A different objection to the method of phenomenological reduction holds that it involves an artificial stance that gives too much emphasis on the theoretical attitude at the expense of feeling and practical concerns.

Another phenomenological method is called &quot;eidetic variation&quot;. It is used to study the essences of things. This is done by imagining an object of the kind under investigation. The features of this object are then varied in order to see whether the resulting object still belongs to the investigated kind. If the object can survive the change of a certain feature then this feature is inessential to this kind. Otherwise, it belongs to the kind&#x27;s &quot;essence&quot;. For example, when imagining a triangle, one can vary its features, like the length of its sides or its color. These features are inessential since the changed object is still a triangle, but it ceases to be a triangle if a fourth side is added.

=== Verificationism ===
The method of verificationism consists in understanding sentences by analyzing their characteristic conditions of verification, i.e. by determining which empirical observations would prove them to be true. A central motivation behind this method has been to distinguish meaningful from meaningless sentences. This is sometimes expressed through the claim that &quot;[the] meaning of a statement is the method of its verification&quot;. Meaningful sentences, like the ones found in the natural sciences, have clear conditions of empirical verification. But since most metaphysical sentences cannot be verified by empirical observations, they are deemed to be non-sensical by verificationists. Verificationism has been criticized on various grounds. On the one hand, it has proved very difficult to give a precise formulation that includes all scientific claims, including the ones about unobservables. This is connected to the problem of underdetermination in the philosophy of science: the problem that the observational evidence is often insufficient to determine which theory is true. This would lead to the implausible conclusion that even for the empirical sciences, many of their claims would be meaningless. But on a deeper level, the basic claim underlying verificationism seems itself to be meaningless by its own standards: it is not clear what empirical observations could verify the claim that the meaning of a sentence is the method of its verification. In this sense, verificationism would be contradictory by directly refuting itself. These and other problems have led some theorists, especially from the sciences, to adopt falsificationism instead. It is a less radical approach that holds that serious theories or hypotheses should at least be falsifiable, i.e. there should be some empirical observations that could prove them wrong.

=== Conceptual analysis ===
The goal of conceptual analysis is to decompose or &quot;analyze&quot; a given concept into its fundamental constituents. It consists in considering a philosophically interesting concept, like knowledge, and determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for whether the application of this concept is true. The resulting claim about the relation between the concept and its constituents is normally seen as knowable a priori since it is true only in virtue of the involved concepts and thereby constitutes an analytic truth. Usually, philosophers use their own intuitions to determine whether a concept is applicable to a specific situation to test their analyses. But other approaches have also been utilized by using not the intuitions of philosophers but of regular people, an approach often defended by experimental philosophers.

G. E. Moore proposed that the correctness of a conceptual analysis can be tested using the open question method. According to this view, asking whether the decomposition fits the concept should result in a closed or pointless question. If it results in an open or intelligible question, then the analysis does not exactly correspond to what we have in mind when we use the term. This can be used, for example, to reject the utilitarian claim that &quot;goodness&quot; is &quot;whatever maximizes happiness&quot;. The underlying argument is that the question &quot;Is what is good what maximizes happiness?&quot; is an open question, unlike the question &quot;Is what is good what is good?&quot;, which is a closed question. One problem with this approach is that it results in a very strict conception of what constitutes a correct conceptual analysis, leading to the conclusion that many concepts, like &quot;goodness&quot;, are simple or indefinable.

Willard Van Orman Quine criticized conceptual analysis as part of his criticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction. This objection is based on the idea that all claims, including how concepts are to be decomposed, are ultimately based on empirical evidence. Another problem with conceptual analysis is that it is often very difficult to find an analysis of a concept that really covers all its cases. For this reason, Rudolf Carnap has suggested a modified version that aims to cover only the most paradigmatic cases while excluding problematic or controversial cases. While this approach has become more popular in recent years, it has also been criticized based on the argument that it tends to change the subject rather than resolve the original problem. In this sense, it is closely related to the method of conceptual engineering, which consists in redefining concepts in fruitful ways or developing new interesting concepts. This method has been applied, for example, to the concepts of gender and race.

=== Common sense ===
The method of common sense is based on the fact that we already have a great variety of beliefs that seem very certain to us, even if we do not believe them based on explicit arguments. Common sense philosophers use these beliefs as their starting point of philosophizing. This often takes the form of criticism directed against theories whose premises or conclusions are very far removed from how the average person thinks about the issue in question. G. E. Moore, for example, rejects J. M. E. McTaggart&#x27;s sophisticated argumentation for the unreality of time based on his common-sense impression that time exists. He holds that his simple common-sense impression is much more certain than that McTaggart&#x27;s arguments are sound, even though Moore was unable to pinpoint where McTaggart&#x27;s arguments went wrong. According to his method, common sense constitutes an evidence base. This base may be used to eliminate philosophical theories that stray too far away from it, that are abstruse from its perspective. This can happen because either the theory itself or consequences that can be drawn from it violate common sense. For common sense philosophers, it is not the task of philosophy to question common sense. Instead, they should analyze it to formulate theories in accordance with it.

One important argument against this method is that common sense has often been wrong in the past, as is exemplified by various scientific discoveries. This suggests that common sense is in such cases just an antiquated theory that is eventually eliminated by the progress of science. For example, Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity constitutes a radical departure from the common-sense conception of space and time, and quantum physics poses equally serious problems to how we tend to think about how elementary particles behave. This puts into question that common sense is a reliable source of knowledge. Another problem is that for many issues, there is no one universally accepted common-sense opinion. In such cases, common sense only amounts to the majority opinion, which should not be blindly accepted by researchers. This problem can be approached by articulating a weaker version of the common-sense method. One such version is defended by Roderick Chisholm, who allows that theories violating common sense may still be true. He contends that, in such cases, the theory in question is &quot;prima facie&quot; suspect and the burden of proof is always on its side. But such a shift in the burden of proof does not constitute a blind belief in common sense since it leaves open the possibility that, for various issues, there is decisive evidence against the common-sense opinion.

=== Ordinary language philosophy ===
The method of ordinary language philosophy consists in tackling philosophical questions based on how the related terms are used in ordinary language. In this sense, it is related to the method of common sense but focuses more on linguistic aspects. Some types of ordinary language philosophy only take a negative form in that they try to show how philosophical problems are not real problems at all. Instead, it is aimed to show that false assumptions, to which humans are susceptible due to the confusing structure of natural language, are responsible for this false impression. Other types take more positive approaches by defending and justifying philosophical claims, for example, based on what sounds insightful or odd to the average English speaker.

One problem for ordinary language philosophy is that regular speakers may have many different reasons for using a certain expression. Sometimes they intend to express what they believe, but other times they may be motivated by politeness or other conversational norms independent of the truth conditions of the expressed sentences. This significantly complicates ordinary language philosophy, since philosophers have to take the specific context of the expression into account, which may considerably alter its meaning. This criticism is partially mitigated by J. L. Austin&#x27;s approach to ordinary language philosophy. According to him, ordinary language already has encoded many important distinctions and is our point of departure in theorizing. But &quot;ordinary language is not the last word: in principle, it can everywhere be supplemented and improved upon and superseded&quot;. However, it also falls prey to another criticism: that it is often not clear how to distinguish ordinary from non-ordinary language. This makes it difficult in all but the paradigmatic cases to decide whether a philosophical claim is or is not supported by ordinary language.

=== Intuition and thought experiments ===
Methods based on intuition, like ethical intuitionism, use intuitions to evaluate whether a philosophical claim is true or false. In this context, intuitions are seen as a non-inferential source of knowledge: they consist in the impression of correctness one has when considering a certain claim. They are intellectual seemings that make it appear to the thinker that the considered proposition is true or false without the need to consider arguments for or against the proposition. This is sometimes expressed by saying that the proposition in question is &quot;self-evident&quot;. Examples of such propositions include &quot;torturing a sentient being for fun is wrong&quot; or &quot;it is irrational to believe both something and its opposite&quot;. But not all defenders of intuitionism restrict intuitions to self-evident propositions. Instead, often weaker non-inferential impressions are also included as intuitions, such as a mother&#x27;s intuition that her child is innocent of a certain crime.

Intuitions can be used in various ways as a philosophical method. On the one hand, philosophers may consult their intuitions in relation to very general principles, which may then be used to deduce further theorems. Another technique, which is often applied in ethics, consists in considering concrete scenarios instead of general principles. This often takes the form of thought experiments, in which certain situations are imagined with the goal of determining the possible consequences of the imagined scenario. These consequences are assessed using intuition and counterfactual thinking. For this reason, thought experiments are sometimes referred to as intuition pumps: they activate the intuitions concerning the specific situation, which may then be generalized to arrive at universal principles. In some cases, the imagined scenario is physically possible but it would not be feasible to make an actual experiment due to the costs, negative consequences, or technological limitations. But other thought experiments even work with scenarios that defy what is physically possible. It is controversial to what extent thought experiments merit to be characterized as &quot;real&quot; experiments and whether the insights they provide are reliable.

One problem with intuitions in general and thought experiments in particular consists in assessing their epistemological status, i.e. whether, how much, and in which circumstances they provide justification in comparison to other sources of knowledge. Some of its defenders claim that intuition is a reliable source of knowledge just like perception, with the difference being that it happens without the sensory organs. Others compare it not to perception but to the cognitive ability to evaluate counterfactual conditionals, which may be understood as the capacity to answer what-if questions. But the reliability of intuitions has been contested by its opponents. For example, wishful thinking may be the reason why it intuitively seems to a person that a proposition is true without providing any epistemological support for this proposition. Another objection, often raised in the empirical and naturalist tradition, is that intuitions do not constitute a reliable source of knowledge since the practitioner restricts themselves to an inquiry from their armchair instead of looking at the world to make empirical observations.

=== Reflective equilibrium ===
Reflective equilibrium is a state in which a thinker has the impression that they have considered all the relevant evidence for and against a theory and have made up their mind on this issue. It is a state of coherent balance among one&#x27;s beliefs. This does not imply that all the evidence has really been considered, but it is tied to the impression that engaging in further inquiry is unlikely to make one change one&#x27;s mind, i.e. that one has reached a stable &quot;equilibrium&quot;. In this sense, it is the endpoint of the deliberative process on the issue in question. The philosophical method of reflective equilibrium aims at reaching this type of state by mentally going back and forth between all relevant beliefs and intuitions. In this process, the thinker may have to let go of some beliefs or deemphasize certain intuitions that do not fit into the overall picture in order to progress.

In this wide sense, reflective equilibrium is connected to a form of coherentism about epistemological justification and is thereby opposed to foundationalist attempts at finding a small set of fixed and unrevisable beliefs from which to build one&#x27;s philosophical theory. One problem with this wide conception of the reflective equilibrium is that it seems trivial: it is a truism that the rational thing to do is to consider all the evidence before making up one&#x27;s mind and to strive towards building a coherent perspective. But as a method to guide philosophizing, this is usually too vague to provide specific guidance.

When understood in a more narrow sense, the method aims at finding an equilibrium between particular intuitions and general principles. On this view, the thinker starts with intuitions about particular cases and formulates general principles that roughly reflect these intuitions. The next step is to deal with the conflicts between the two by adjusting both the intuitions and the principles to reconcile them until an equilibrium is reached. One problem with this narrow interpretation is that it depends very much on the intuitions one started with. This means that different philosophers may start with very different intuitions and may therefore be unable to find a shared equilibrium. For example, the narrow method of reflective equilibrium may lead some moral philosophers towards utilitarianism and others towards Kantianism.

=== Pragmatic method ===
The pragmatic method assesses the truth or falsity of theories by looking at the consequences of accepting them. In this sense, &quot;[t]he test of truth is utility: it&#x27;s true if it works&quot;. Pragmatists approach intractable philosophical disputes in a down-to-earth fashion by asking about the concrete consequences associated, for example, with whether an abstract metaphysical theory is true or false. This is also intended to clarify the underlying issues by spelling out what would follow from them. Another goal of this approach is to expose pseudo-problems, which involve a merely verbal disagreement without any genuine difference on the level of the consequences between the competing standpoints.

Succinct summaries of the pragmatic method base it on the pragmatic maxim, of which various versions exist. An important version is due to Charles Sanders Peirce: &quot;Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of those effects is the whole of our conception of the object.&quot; Another formulation is due to William James: &quot;To develop perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object, then, we need only consider what effects of a conceivable practical kind the object may involve – what sensations we are to expect from it and what reactions we must prepare&quot;. Various criticisms to the pragmatic method have been raised. For example, it is commonly rejected that the terms &quot;true&quot; and &quot;useful&quot; mean the same thing. A closely related problem is that believing in a certain theory may be useful to one person and useless to another, which would mean the same theory is both true and false.

=== Transcendental method ===
The transcendental method () is used to study phenomena by reflecting on the conditions of possibility of these phenomena. This method usually starts out with an obvious fact, often about our mental life, such as what we know or experience. It then goes on to argue that for this fact to obtain, other facts also have to obtain: they are its conditions of possibility. This type of argument is called &quot;transcendental argument&quot;: it argues that these additional assumptions also have to be true because otherwise, the initial fact would not be the case. For example, it has been used to argue for the existence of an external world based on the premise that the experience of the temporal order of our mental states would not be possible otherwise. Another example argues in favor of a description of nature in terms of concepts such as motion, force, and causal interaction based on the claim that an objective account of nature would not be possible otherwise.

Transcendental arguments have faced various challenges. On the one hand, the claim that the belief in a certain assumption is necessary for the experience of a certain entity is often not obvious. So in the example above, critics can argue against the transcendental argument by denying the claim that an external world is necessary for the experience of the temporal order of our mental states. But even if this point is granted, it does not guarantee that the assumption itself is true. So even if the belief in a given proposition is a psychological necessity for a certain experience, it does not automatically follow that this belief itself is true. Instead, it could be the case that humans are just wired in such a way that they have to believe in certain false assumptions.

=== Experimental philosophy ===
Experimental philosophy is the most recent development of the methods discussed in this article: it began only in the early years of the 21st century. Experimental philosophers try to answer philosophical questions by gathering empirical data. It is an interdisciplinary approach that applies the methods of psychology and the cognitive sciences to topics studied by philosophy. This usually takes the form of surveys probing the intuitions of ordinary people and then drawing conclusions from the findings. For example, one such inquiry came to the conclusion that justified true belief may be sufficient for knowledge despite various Gettier cases claiming to show otherwise. The method of experimental philosophy can be used both in a negative or a positive program. As a negative program, it aims to challenge traditional philosophical movements and positions. This can be done, for example, by showing how the intuitions used to defend certain claims vary a lot depending on factors such as culture, gender, or ethnicity. This variation casts doubt on the reliability of the intuitions and thereby also on theories supported by them. As a positive program, it uses empirical data to support its own philosophical claims. It differs from other philosophical methods in that it usually studies the intuitions of ordinary people and uses them, and not the experts&#x27; intuitions, as philosophical evidence.

One problem for both the positive and the negative approaches is that the data obtained from surveys do not constitute hard empirical evidence since they do not directly express the intuitions of the participants. The participants may react to subtle pragmatic cues in giving their answers, which brings with it the need for further interpretation in order to get from the given answers to the intuitions responsible for these answers. Another problem concerns the question of how reliable the intuitions of ordinary people on the often very technical issues are. The core of this objection is that, for many topics, the opinions of ordinary people are not very reliable since they have little familiarity with the issues themselves and the underlying problems they may pose. For this reason, it has been argued that they cannot replace the expert intuitions found in trained philosophers. Some critics have even argued that experimental philosophy does not really form part of &quot;philosophy&quot;. This objection does not reject that the method of experimental philosophy has value, it just rejects that this method belongs to philosophical methodology.

=== Others ===
Various other philosophical methods have been proposed. The Socratic method or Socratic debate is a form of cooperative philosophizing in which one philosopher usually first states a claim, which is then scrutinized by their interlocutor by asking them questions about various related claims, often with the implicit goal of putting the initial claim into doubt. It continues to be a popular method for teaching philosophy. Plato and Aristotle emphasize the role of wonder in the practice of philosophy. On this view, &quot;philosophy begins in wonder&quot; and &quot;[i]t was their wonder, astonishment, that first led men to philosophize and still leads them&quot;. This position is also adopted in the more recent philosophy of Nicolai Hartmann. Various other types of methods were discussed in ancient Greek philosophy, like analysis, synthesis, dialectics, demonstration, definition, and reduction to absurdity. The medieval philosopher Thomas Aquinas identifies composition and division as ways of forming propositions while he sees invention and judgment as forms of reasoning from the known to the unknown.

Various methods for the selection between competing theories have been proposed. They often focus on the theoretical virtues of the involved theories. One such method is based on the idea that, everything else being equal, the simpler theory is to be preferred. Another gives preference to the theory that provides the best explanation. According to the method of epistemic conservatism, we should, all other things being equal, prefer the theory which, among its competitors, is the most conservative, i.e. the one closest to the beliefs we currently hold. One problem with these methods of theory selection is that it is usually not clear how the different virtues are to be weighted, often resulting in cases where they are unable to resolve disputes between competing theories that excel at different virtues.

Methodological naturalism holds that all philosophical claims are synthetic claims that ultimately depend for their justification or rejection on empirical observational evidence. In this sense, philosophy is continuous with the natural sciences in that they both give priority to the scientific method for investigating all areas of reality.

According to truthmaker theorists, every true proposition is true because another entity, its truthmaker, exists. This principle can be used as a methodology to critically evaluate philosophical theories. In particular, this concerns theories that accept certain truths but are unable to provide their truthmaker. Such theorists are derided as &quot;ontological cheaters&quot;. For example, this can be applied to philosophical presentism, the view that nothing outside the present exists. Philosophical presentists usually accept the very common belief that dinosaurs existed but have trouble in providing a truthmaker for this belief since they deny existence to past entities.

In philosophy, the term &quot;genealogical method&quot; refers to a form of criticism that tries to expose commonly held beliefs by uncovering their historical origin and function. For example, it may be used to reject specific moral claims or the status of truth by giving a concrete historical reconstruction of how their development was contingent on power relations in society. This is usually accompanied by the assertion that these beliefs were accepted and became established, because of non-rational considerations, such as because they served the interests of a predominant class.

== Disagreements and influence ==
The disagreements within philosophy do not only concern which first-order philosophical claims are true, they also concern the second-order issue of which philosophical methods to use. One way to evaluate philosophical methods is to assess how well they do at solving philosophical problems. The question of the nature of philosophy has important implications for which methods of inquiry are appropriate to philosophizing. Seeing philosophy as an empirical science brings its methods much closer to the methods found in the natural sciences. Seeing it as the attempt to clarify concepts and increase understanding, on the other hand, usually leads to a methodology much more focused on apriori reasoning. In this sense, philosophical methodology is closely tied up with the question of how philosophy is to be defined. Different conceptions of philosophy often associated it with different goals, leading to certain methods being more or less suited to reach the corresponding goal.

The interest in philosophical methodology has risen a lot in contemporary philosophy. But some philosophers reject its importance by emphasizing that &quot;preoccupation with questions about methods tends to distract us from prosecuting the methods themselves&quot;. However, such objections are often dismissed by pointing out that philosophy is at its core a reflective and critical enterprise, which is perhaps best exemplified by its preoccupation with its own methods. This is also backed up by the arguments to the effect that one&#x27;s philosophical method has important implications for how one does philosophy and which philosophical claims one accepts or rejects. Since philosophy also studies the methodology of other disciplines, such as the methods of science, it has been argued that the study of its own methodology is an essential part of philosophy.

In several instances in the history of philosophy, the discovery of a new philosophical method, such as Cartesian doubt or the phenomenological method, has had important implications both on how philosophers conducted their theorizing and what claims they set out to defend. In some cases, such discoveries led the involved philosophers to overly optimistic outlooks, seeing them as historic breakthroughs that would dissolve all previous disagreements in philosophy.

== Relation to other fields ==
=== Science ===
The methods of philosophy differ in various respects from the methods found in the natural sciences. One important difference is that philosophy does not use experimental data obtained through measuring equipment like telescopes or cloud chambers to justify its claims. For example, even philosophical naturalists emphasizing the close relation between philosophy and the sciences mostly practice a form of armchair theorizing instead of gathering empirical data. Experimental philosophers are an important exception: they use methods found in social psychology and other empirical sciences to test their claims.

One reason for the methodological difference between philosophy and science is that philosophical claims are usually more speculative and cannot be verified or falsified by looking through a telescope. This problem is not solved by citing works published by other philosophers, since it only defers the question of how their insights are justified. An additional complication concerning testimony is that different philosophers often defend mutually incompatible claims, which poses the challenge of how to select between them. Another difference between scientific and philosophical methodology is that there is wide agreement among scientists concerning their methods, testing procedures, and results. This is often linked to the fact that science has seen much more progress than philosophy.

=== Epistemology ===
An important goal of philosophical methods is to assist philosophers in attaining knowledge. This is often understood in terms of evidence. In this sense, philosophical methodology is concerned with the questions of what constitutes philosophical evidence, how much support it offers, and how to acquire it. In contrast to the empirical sciences, it is often claimed that empirical evidence is not used in justifying philosophical theories, that philosophy is less about the empirical world and more about how we think about the empirical world. In this sense, philosophy is often identified with conceptual analysis, which is concerned with explaining concepts and showing their interrelations. Philosophical naturalists often reject this line of thought and hold that empirical evidence can confirm or disconfirm philosophical theories, at least indirectly.

Philosophical evidence, which may be obtained, for example, through intuitions or thought experiments, is central for justifying basic principles and axioms. These principles can then be used as premises to support further conclusions. Some approaches to philosophical methodology emphasize that these arguments have to be deductively valid, i.e. that the truth of their premises ensures the truth of their conclusion. In other cases, philosophers may commit themselves to working hypotheses or norms of investigation even though they lack sufficient evidence. Such assumptions can be quite fruitful in simplifying the possibilities the philosopher needs to consider and by guiding them to ask interesting questions. But the lack of evidence makes this type of enterprise vulnerable to criticism.

<text>Punch and Judy is a traditional puppet show featuring Mr. Punch and his wife Judy. The performance consists of a sequence of short scenes, each depicting an interaction between two characters, most typically the anarchic Mr. Punch and one other character who usually falls victim to the intentional violence of Punch&#x27;s slapstick. First appearing in England in 1662, Punch and Judy was called by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; &quot;a staple of the British seaside scene&quot;. The various episodes of Punch comedy—often provoking shocked laughter—are dominated by the clowning of Mr. Punch.

The show is performed by a single puppeteer inside the booth, known since Victorian times as a &quot;professor&quot; or &quot;punchman&quot;, and assisted sometimes by a &quot;bottler&quot; who corrals the audience outside the booth, introduces the performance, and collects the money (&quot;the bottle&quot;). The bottler might also play accompanying music or sound effects on a drum or guitar, and engage in back chat with the puppets, sometimes repeating lines that may have been difficult for the audience to understand. In the Victorian era, the drum and pan pipes were the instruments of choice. Today, most professors work solo, since the need for a bottler became less important when street performing with the show gave way to paid engagements at private parties or public events. In modern shows the audience is encouraged to participate, calling out to the characters on the stage—typically shouting &quot;He&#x27;s behind you!&quot;—to warn them of danger or clue them in to what is going on behind their backs.

==History==
The Punch and Judy show has roots in the 17th century Italian commedia dell&#x27;arte. The figure of Punch is derived from the Neapolitan stock character of Pulcinella, which was anglicized to &quot;Punchinello&quot;. He is a variation on the same themes as the Lord of Misrule and the many Trickster figures found in mythologies across the world. Punch&#x27;s wife was originally called &quot;Joan.&quot;

The figure who became the anarchic Mr. Punch made his first recorded appearance in England on 9 May 1662, which is traditionally reckoned as Punch&#x27;s UK birthday. Punch and Judy began to emerge during the Restoration Period (beginning in 1660), a period during which art and theatre thrived. King Charles II took the throne in 1660 and replaced Puritan leaders Oliver Cromwell and Richard Cromwell, and theatre culture was revived. Cromwell strictly adhered to the Puritan belief that theatre was immoral and should be banned, resulting in their closure in 1642. The repressive regime also saw street entertainers jailed. Charles II&#x27;s ascension to the throne ended the interregnum, Puritan legislation was declared null and void, and a more tolerant period of art and culture was ushered in. William Langley of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; writes Punch and Judy &quot;owes much of its original success to the bleak killjoyism of Cromwell&#x27;s England. Charles II&#x27;s resumption of the throne in 1660 unleashed a huge public demand for popular entertainment&quot;. The diarist Samuel Pepys observed a marionette show featuring an early version of the Punch character in Covent Garden in London. It was performed by Italian puppet showman Pietro Gimonde, a.k.a. &quot;Signor Bologna&quot;, one of many entertainers from continental Europe who came to England following the restoration. Pepys described the event in his diary as &quot;an Italian puppet play, that is within the rails there, which is very pretty.&quot; 

In the British Punch and Judy show, Punch speaks in a distinctive squawking voice, produced by a contrivance known as a &quot;swazzle&quot; or &quot;swatchel&quot; which the professor holds in his mouth, transmitting his gleeful cackle. This gives Punch a vocal quality as though he were speaking through a kazoo. Joan&#x27;s name was changed to Judy because &quot;Judy&quot; was easier to enunciate with the swazzle than &quot;Joan&quot;. So important is Punch&#x27;s signature sound that it is a matter of some controversy within Punch and Judy circles as to whether a &quot;non-&quot; show can be considered a true Punch and Judy Show. Other characters do not use the swazzle, so the Punchman has to switch back and forth while still holding the device in his mouth.

Punch and Judy shows were traditionally marionette shows when they were brought over from Italy, but were later reinvented in the glove puppet style to accommodate the characters&#x27; violent movements without the obstruction of marionette strings. Glove puppets were often operated by placing the thumb in one arm, the middle, ring, and little fingers in the other arm, and the index finger in the head.

In the early 18th century, the puppet theatre starring Punch was at its height, with showman Martin Powell attracting sizable crowds at both his &quot;Punch&#x27;s Theatre&quot; at Covent Garden and earlier in provincial Bath, Somerset. Powell has been credited with being &quot;largely responsible for the form taken by the drama of Punch and Judy&quot;. In 1721, a puppet theatre opened in Dublin that ran for decades. The cross-dressing actress Charlotte Charke ran the successful but short-lived Punch&#x27;s Theatre in the Old Tennis Court at St. James&#x27;s, Westminster, presenting adaptations of Shakespeare as well as plays by herself, her father Colley Cibber, and her friend Henry Fielding. Fielding eventually ran his own puppet theatre under the pseudonym Madame de la Nash to avoid the censorship concomitant with the theatre Licensing Act 1737.

Punch was extremely popular in Paris and, by the end of the 18th century, he was also playing in Britain&#x27;s American colonies, where a fan of the show George Washington bought tickets. However, marionette productions were expensive and cumbersome to mount and transport, presented in empty halls, the back rooms of taverns, or within large tents at England&#x27;s yearly agricultural events at Bartholomew Fair and Mayfair. In the latter half of the 18th century, marionette companies began to give way to glove-puppet shows, performed from within a narrow, lightweight booth by one puppeteer, usually with an assistant, or &quot;bottler,&quot; to gather a crowd and collect money. These shows might travel through country towns or move from corner to corner along busy London streets, giving many performances in a single day. The character of Punch adapted to the new format, going from a stringed comedian who might say outrageous things to a more aggressive glove-puppet who could do outrageous—and often violent—things to the other characters. 

The mobile puppet booth of the late 18th- and early 19th-century Punch and Judy glove-puppet show could be easily fitted-up and was originally covered in checked bed ticking or whatever inexpensive cloth might come to hand. Later Victorian booths were gaudier affairs, particularly those used for Christmas parties and other indoor performances. In the 20th century, however, red-and-white-striped puppet booths became iconic features on the beaches of many English seaside and summer holiday resorts.

A more substantial change came over time to the show&#x27;s target audience. The show was originally intended for adults, but it changed into primarily a children&#x27;s entertainment in the late Victorian era. Ancient members of the show&#x27;s cast ceased to be included, such as the Devil and Punch&#x27;s mistress &quot;Pretty Polly,&quot; when they came to be seen as inappropriate for young audiences.

The story changes, but some phrases remain the same for decades or even centuries. For example, Punch dispatches his foes each in turn and still squeaks his famous catchphrase: &quot;&quot;That&#x27;s&quot; the way to do it!&quot; The term &quot;pleased as Punch&quot; is derived from Punch and Judy; specifically, Mr. Punch&#x27;s characteristic sense of gleeful self-satisfaction.

Modern British performances of Punch and Judy are no longer exclusively the traditional seaside children&#x27;s entertainments which they had become. They can now be seen at carnivals, festivals, birthday parties, and other celebratory occasions. The association of Punch with the seaside is still very strong however, as demonstrated by Wisbech Town council&#x27;s annual Wis-BEACH day each summer, &quot;all the seaside favourites are on show, including a donkey, deck chairs, Punch and Judy and fish and chips&quot;.

==Characters==
The characters in a Punch and Judy show are not fixed. They are similar to the cast of a soap opera or a folk tale such as Robin Hood: the principal characters must appear, but the lesser characters are included at the discretion of the performer. New cast may be added and older cast dropped as the tradition changes.

Along with Punch and Judy, the cast of characters usually includes their baby, a hungry crocodile, a clown, an officious policeman, and a prop string of sausages. The devil and the generic hangman Jack Ketch may still make their appearances but, if so, Punch will always get the better of them. The cast of a typical Punch and Judy show today will include:
* Mr. Punch
* Judy
* The Babe 
* The Constable (a.k.a. Policeman Jack)
* Joey the Clown
* The Crocodile
* The Skeleton
* The Doctor

Characters once regular but now occasional include:
* Toby the Dog
* The Ghost
* The Lawyer
* Hector the Horse
* Pretty Polly
* The Hangman (a.k.a. Jack Ketch)
* The Devil
* The Beadle
* Jim Crow (&quot;The Black Man&quot;)
* Mr. Scaramouche
* The Servant (or &quot;The Minstrel&quot;)
* The Blind Man

Other characters included Boxers, Chinese Plate Spinners, topical figures, a trick puppet with an extending neck (the &quot;Courtier&quot;), and a monkey. A live Toby the Dog was once a regular featured novelty routine, sitting on the playboard and performing &quot;with&quot; the puppets.

Punch wears a brightly coloured (traditionally red) jester&#x27;s motley and sugarloaf hat with a tassel. He is a hunchback whose hooked nose almost meets his curved, jutting chin. He carries a stick (called a slapstick) as large as himself, which he freely uses upon most of the other characters in the show. Judy wears an apron, a blue dress, and a bonnet and frequently tries to tell Punch off when he uses the slapstick.

==Story==
Glyn Edwards has likened the story of Punch and Judy to the story of Cinderella. He points out that there are parts of the Cinderella story which everyone knows, namely the cruel step sisters, the invitation to the ball, the handsome prince, the fairy godmother, Cinderella&#x27;s dress turning to rags at midnight, the glass slipper left behind, the prince searching for its owner, and the happy ending. None of these elements can be omitted and the famous story still be told. The same principle applies to Punch and Judy. Everyone knows that Punch mishandles the baby, that Punch and Judy quarrel and fight, that a policeman comes for Punch and gets a taste of his stick, that Punch has a gleeful run-in with a variety of other figures and takes his stick to them all, that eventually he faces his final foe (which might be a hangman, the devil, a crocodile, or a ghost). Edwards contends that a proper Punch and Judy show requires these elements or the audience will feel let down.

Peter Fraser writes, &quot;the drama developed as a succession of incidents which the audience could join or leave at any time, and much of the show was impromptu.&quot; This was elaborated by George Speaight, who explained that the plotline &quot;is like a story compiled in a parlour game of Consequences ... the show should, indeed, not be regarded as a story at all but a succession of encounters.&quot; Robert Leach makes it clear that &quot;the story is a conceptual entity, not a set text: the means of telling it, therefore, are always variable.&quot; Rosalind Crone asserts that the story needed to be episodic so that passersby on the street could easily join or leave the audience during a performance.

Much emphasis is often placed on the first printed script of Punch and Judy, in 1827. It was based on a show by travelling performer Giovanni Piccini, illustrated by George Cruikshank, and written by John Payne Collier. This is the only surviving script of a performance, and its accuracy is questioned. The performance was stopped frequently to allow Collier and Cruikshank to write and sketch and, in the words of Speaight, Collier is someone of whom &quot;the full list of his forgeries has not yet been reckoned, and the myths he propagated are still being repeated. (His) &#x27;Punch and Judy&#x27; is to be warmly welcomed as the first history of puppets in England, but it is also sadly to be examined as the first experiment of a literary criminal.&quot;

The tale of Punch and Judy varies from puppeteer to puppeteer, as previously with Punchinello and Joan, and it has changed over time. Nonetheless, the skeletal outline is often recognizable. It typically involves Punch behaving outrageously, struggling with his wife Judy and the baby, and then triumphing in a series of encounters with the forces of law and order (and often the supernatural), interspersed with jokes and songs.

===Typical 21st-century performance===
A typical show as performed currently in the UK will start with the arrival of Mr. Punch, followed by the introduction of Judy. They may well kiss and dance before Judy requests Mr. Punch to look after the baby. Punch will fail to carry out this task appropriately. It is rare for Punch to hit his baby these days, but he may well sit on it in a failed attempt to &quot;babysit&quot;, or drop it, or even let it go through a sausage machine. In any event, Judy will return, will be outraged, will fetch a stick, and the knockabout will commence. A policeman will arrive in response to the mayhem and will himself be felled by Punch&#x27;s stick. All this is carried out at breakneck farcical speed with much involvement from a gleefully shouting audience. From here on anything goes.

Joey the Clown might appear and suggest, &quot;It&#x27;s dinner time.&quot; This will lead to the production of a string of sausages, which Mr. Punch must look after, although the audience will know that this really signals the arrival of a crocodile whom Mr. Punch might not see until the audience shouts out and lets him know. Punch&#x27;s subsequent comic struggle with the crocodile might then leave him in need of a Doctor who will arrive and attempt to treat Punch by walloping him with a stick until Punch turns the tables on him. Punch may next pause to count his &quot;victims&quot; by laying puppets on the stage, only for Joey the Clown to move them about behind his back in order to frustrate him. A ghost might then appear and give Mr. Punch a fright before it too is chased off with a stick.

In older productions, a hangman would arrive to punish Mr. Punch, only to himself be tricked into sticking his head in the noose. &quot;Do you do the hanging?&quot; is a question often asked of performers. Some will include it where circumstances warrant (such as for an adult audience) but most do not. Finally, the show will often end with the Devil arriving for Mr. Punch (and possibly threatening his audience as well). Punch—in his final gleefully triumphant moment—will win his fight with the Devil, bring the show to a rousing conclusion, and earn a round of applause.

===Plots reflect their own era===
Punch and Judy might follow no fixed storyline, as with the tales of Robin Hood, but there are episodes common to many recorded versions. It is these set piece encounters or &quot;routines&quot; which are used by performers to construct their own Punch and Judy shows. A visit to a Punch and Judy Festival at Punch&#x27;s &quot;birthplace&quot; in London&#x27;s Covent Garden will reveal a whole variety of changes that are rung by puppeteers from this basic material. Scripts have been published at different times since the early 19th century, but none can be claimed as the definitive traditional script of Punch and Judy. Each printed script reflects the era in which it was performed and the circumstances under which it was printed.

The various episodes of the show are performed in the spirit of outrageous comedy—often provoking shocked laughter—and are dominated by the anarchic clowning of Mr. Punch. Just as the Victorian version of the show drew on the morality of its day, so also the Punch &amp; Judy College of Professors considers that the 20th- and 21st-century versions of the tale is used as a vehicle for grotesque visual comedy and a sideways look at contemporary society.

An awareness of the prevalence of domestic abuse, and how Punch and Judy could be seen to make light of this, has caused changes in Punch and Judy performances in the UK and other English-speaking countries. The show continues to be seen in England, Wales, and Ireland—and also in Canada, the United States, the Caribbean and Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In 2001, the characters were honoured in the UK with a set of British commemorative postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail. In a 2006 UK poll, the public voted Punch and Judy onto the list of icons of England. In 2024, a new version of the show was staged at London&#x27;s Covent Garden. It was developed as part of the Judy Project, a three year study of the roles that women have played in the tradition of puppetry, by a University of Exeter team. The violence in this version of the show is directed more towards institutions of authority rather than any individuals, and Judy questions the treatment she has received from Punch over hundreds of years.

==Comedy ==
Despite Punch&#x27;s unapologetic murders throughout the performances, it is still considered a comedy. The humour is aided by a few things. Rosalind Crone suggests that, since the puppets are carved from wood, their facial expressions cannot change, but are stuck in the same exaggerated pose, which helps to deter any sense of realism and to distance the audience. The use of the swazzle also helps to create humour, and that the sound of Punch&#x27;s voice takes the cruelty out of Punch. According to Crone, a third aspect that helped make the violence humorous was that Punch&#x27;s violence toward his wife was prompted by her own violence toward him. In this aspect, he retains some of his previous hen-pecked persona. This would suggest that, since Punch was merely acting violently out of self-defence, it was okay. This is a possible explanation for the humour of his violence toward his wife, and even towards others who may have somehow &quot;had it coming.&quot; This suggestion better explains the humour of the violence toward the baby. Other characters that had to incur the wrath of Punch varied depending on the punchman, but the most common were the foreigner, the blind man, the publican, the constable, and the devil.

==Published scripts==
Punch is primarily an oral tradition, adapted by a succession of exponents from live performances rather than authentic scripts, and in constant evolution. They exist, however, in some early published scripts of varying authenticity.

In 1828, the critic John Payne Collier published a Punch and Judy script under the title &quot;The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Punch and Judy&quot;. The script was illustrated by the well-known caricaturist George Cruikshank. Collier said his script was based on the version performed by the &quot;professor&quot; Giovanni Piccini in the early 19th century, and Piccini himself had begun performing in the streets of London in the late 18th century. The Collier/Cruickshank &quot;Punch&quot; has been republished in facsimile several times. Collier&#x27;s later career as a literary forger has cast some doubt on the authenticity of the script, which is rather literary in style and may well have been tidied up from the rough-and-tumble street-theatre original.

A transcript of a typical Punch and Judy show in London may be found in Henry Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot;.

==Legacy==
=== Literature ===

The editors of the British satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, established in 1841, took the anarchic Mr Punch as their mascot, with the character also an inspiration for the magazine&#x27;s name.

The novel &quot;Rivers of London&quot; (&quot;Midnight Riot&quot; in the US) by Ben Aaronovitch is embedded in the story of Punch and Judy to tell a story of a ghostly serial killer.

Russell Hoban&#x27;s 1980 novel &quot;Riddley Walker&quot; features a post-apocalyptic version of a Punch and Judy show.

Terry Pratchett&#x27;s 1993 short murder mystery story &quot;Theatre of Cruelty&quot; was inspired by Punch and Judy. It is set in his Discworld fantasy universe, and a Punch and Judy show is also referenced briefly in the 2003 Discworld novel &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot;.

===Musical theatre===
In 2013, a musical inspired by the Punch and Judy characters premiered in Sweden at Arbisteatern in Norrköping, &quot;Carnival Tale (Tivolisaga)&quot; written by Johan Christher Schütz and Johan Pettersson. With a storyline loosely inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, a travelling carnival arrives in a small town and the foreign carnival&#x27;s star jester Punch falls in love with the Mayor&#x27;s daughter Judy. The original Swedish cast recording is freely available online and features Disney Channel Scandinavia presenter Linnéa Källström as Judy. The story and songs originate from a pop band called &quot;Punch and Judy Show&quot;, started by Schütz and Pettersson in the late 1990s.

===Film===
A performance of Punch and Judy features prominently in the 1963 film &quot;Charade&quot; directed by Stanley Donen starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn with the two lead characters watching the show while the inspector lurks nearby. The film&#x27;s composer Henry Mancini also recorded a song titled &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; for the film soundtrack.

&quot;Judy and Punch&quot; is a 2019 Australian film written and directed by Mirrah Foulkes which retells the plot of the puppet show as a black comedy-drama. It stars Damon Herriman as &quot;Punch&quot; and Mia Wasikowska as &quot;Judy&quot;. The film first premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. The plot reimagines the classic puppet show as a revenge tale, in which Judy and Punch are married puppeteers in the fictional town of Seaside, with a popular show about themselves. Following the traditional element of the show, Punch&#x27;s carelessness leads to the death of their baby, prompting a fight between him and Judy. Having been thought dead after Punch&#x27;s beating, Judy survives with the help of village outcasts and decides to enact her revenge on her husband, who has scapegoated their servants. The film took Best Original Music Score and Best Actor (Herriman) at the 9th AACTA Awards, and had seven other nominations.

===Song===
Punch is faithfully celebrated in the 1977 UK novelty hit &quot;Naughty Naughty Naughty&quot;, in which Joy Sarney interacts romantically with an authentic Mr Punch, complete with swazzle, stick, and his traditional catch phrases including &quot;That&#x27;s the way to do it&quot; and &quot;Oh no it isn&#x27;t&quot;. The song made it into the top 30 of the UK Singles Chart and was performed on the BBC television series &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. &quot;Naughty Naughty Naughty&quot; remains Sarney&#x27;s only hit.

The British band Marillion had a UK Top 40 single called &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; in 1984. American singer-songwriter Elliott Smith included a song titled after the show on his 1997 album, &quot;Either/Or&quot;. The show is also referenced in Jack Stauber&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Blondie&quot;, Blondie resembling a puppet and having an unhealthy relationship with the singing character.

===Television===
Punch and Judy appear as Joker&#x27;s oversized henchmen in &quot;The Batman&quot; television series. They made their first appearance in DC Comics in 1945, in &quot;Batman&quot; #31.

===Video games===
A video game called &quot;Punchy&quot; was released for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 home computers in the 1980s. In the game, Punch holds Judy hostage in the booth, and the player takes the role of Bobby the policeman who has to rescue her, overcoming custard pies, tomatoes and pits, as well as tackling Mr. Punch himself.

<text>Poker is a family of comparing card games in which players wager over which hand is best according to that specific game&#x27;s rules. It is played worldwide, but in some places the rules may vary. While the earliest known form of the game was played with just 20 cards, today it is usually played with a standard 52-card deck, although in countries where short packs are common, it may be played with 32, 40 or 48 cards. Thus poker games vary in deck configuration, the number of cards in play, the number dealt face up or face down and the number shared by all players, but all have rules that involve one or more rounds of betting.

In most modern poker games, the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet (the &quot;blind&quot; or &quot;ante&quot;). In standard poker, each player bets according to the rank they believe their hand is worth as compared to the other players. The action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match (or &quot;call&quot;) the maximum previous bet, or fold, losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand. A player who matches a bet may also &quot;raise&quot; (increase) the bet. The betting round ends when all players have either called the last bet or folded. If all but one player folds on any round, the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand. If more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round, a showdown takes place where the hands are revealed, and the player with the winning hand takes the pot.

With the exception of initial forced bets, money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has a positive expected value or who is trying to bluff other players for various strategic reasons. Thus, while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance, the long-run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability, psychology and game theory.

Poker has increased in popularity since the beginning of the 21st century, and has gone from being primarily a recreational activity confined to small groups of enthusiasts to a widely popular activity, both for participants and spectators, including online, with many professional players and multimillion-dollar tournament prizes.

==History==
While poker&#x27;s exact origin is the subject of debate, many game scholars point to the French game Poque and the Iranian game As-Nas as possible early inspirations. For example, in the 1937 edition of Foster&#x27;s Complete Hoyle, R. F. Foster wrote that &quot;the game of poker, as first played in the United States, five cards to each player from a twenty-card pack, is undoubtedly the Persian game of As-Nas.&quot; However, in the 1990s the notion that poker is a direct derivative of As-Nas began to be challenged by gaming historians including David Parlett. What is certain, however, is that poker was popularized in the American South in the early 19th century, as gambling riverboats in the Mississippi River and around New Orleans during the 1830s helped spread the game. One early description of poker was played on a steamboat in 1829 is recorded by the English actor, Joe Cowell. The game was played with twenty cards ranking from Ace (high) to Ten (low).

In contrast to this version of poker, seven-card stud only appeared in the middle of the 19th century, and was largely spread by the US military. It became a staple in many casinos following World War II and grew in popularity with the advent of the World Series of Poker in the 1970s.

Texas hold &#x27;em and other community card games began to dominate the gambling scenes over the next couple of decades. The televising of poker was a particularly strong influence increasing the popularity of the game during the turn of the millennium, resulting in the poker boom a few years later between 2003 and 2006. Today the game has grown to become an extremely popular pastime worldwide.

==Gameplay==

In casual play, the right to deal a hand typically rotates among the players and is marked by a token called a &quot;dealer button&quot; (or &quot;buck&quot;). In a casino, a house dealer handles the cards for each hand, but the button (typically a white plastic disk) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting. The cards are dealt clockwise around the poker table, one at a time.

One or more players are usually required to make forced bets, usually either an &quot;ante&quot; or a &quot;blind bet&quot; (sometimes both). The dealer shuffles the cards, the player on the chair to their right cuts, and the dealer deals the appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time, beginning with the player to their left. Cards may be dealt either face-up or face-down, depending on the variant of poker being played. After the initial deal, the first of what may be several betting rounds begins. Between rounds, the players&#x27; hands develop in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. At the end of each round, all bets are gathered into the central pot.

At any time during a betting round, if one player bets, no opponents choose to &quot;call&quot; (match) the bet, and all opponents instead &quot;fold&quot;, the hand ends immediately, the bettor is awarded the pot, no cards are required to be shown, and the next hand begins. This is what makes bluffing possible. Bluffing is a primary feature of poker, distinguishing it from other vying games and from other games that use poker hand rankings.

At the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a showdown, in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot. A poker hand comprises five cards; in variants where a player has more than five cards available to them, only the best five-card combination counts. There are 10 different kinds of poker hands, such as straight flush and four of a kind.

==Variants==

Poker has many variations, all following a similar pattern of play and generally using the same hand ranking hierarchy. There are four main families of variants, largely grouped by the protocol of card-dealing and betting:

;Straight: A complete hand is dealt to each player, and players bet in one round, with raising and re-raising allowed. This is the oldest poker family; the root of the game as now played was a game known as Primero, which evolved into the game three-card brag, a very popular gentleman&#x27;s game around the time of the American Revolutionary War and still enjoyed in the U.K. today. &quot;Straight&quot; hands of five cards are sometimes used as a final showdown, but poker is almost always played in a more complex form to allow for additional strategy.
;Stud poker: Cards are dealt in a prearranged combination of face-down and face-up rounds, or &quot;streets&quot;, with a round of betting following each. This is the next-oldest family; as poker progressed from three to five-card hands, they were often dealt one card at a time, either face-down or face-up, with a betting round between each. The most popular stud variant today, seven-card stud, deals two extra cards to each player (three face-down, four face-up) from which they must make the best possible 5-card hand.

;Draw poker: Five-card draw: A complete hand is dealt to each player, face-down. Then each player must place an ante to the pot. They can then see their cards and bet accordingly. After betting, players can discard up to three cards and take new ones from the top of the deck. Then, another round of betting takes place. Finally, each player must show their cards and the player with the best hand wins.

;Community card poker: Also known as &quot;flop poker,&quot; community card poker is a variation of stud poker. Players are dealt an incomplete hand of face-down cards, and then a number of face-up community cards are dealt to the center of the table, each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a 5-card hand. Texas hold &#x27;em and Omaha are two well-known variants of the community card family.

There are several methods for defining the structure of betting during a hand of poker. The three most common structures are known as &quot;fixed-limit,&quot; &quot;pot-limit,&quot; and &quot;no-limit.&quot; In fixed-limit poker, betting and raising must be done by standardized amounts. For instance, if the required bet is X, an initial bettor may only bet X; if a player wishes to raise a bet, they may only raise by X. In pot-limit poker, a player may bet or raise any amount up to the size of the pot. When calculating the maximum raise allowed, all previous bets and calls, including the intending raiser&#x27;s call, are first added to the pot. The raiser may then raise the previous bet by the full amount of the pot. In no-limit poker, a player may wager their entire betting stack at any point that they are allowed to make a bet. In all games, if a player does not have enough betting chips to fully match a bet, they may go &quot;all-in,&quot; allowing them to show down their hand for the number of chips they have remaining.

While typical poker games award the pot to the highest hand as per the standard ranking of poker hands, there are variations where the lowest ranked hand wins. In such games the best hand contains the lowest cards rather than the highest cards; some variations may be further complicated by whether or not hands such as flushes and straights are considered in the hand rankings. There are also games where the highest and lowest hands divide the pot between them, known as &quot;high low split&quot; games.

Other games that use poker hand rankings may likewise be referred to as &quot;poker&quot;. Video poker is a single-player video game that functions much like a slot machine; most video poker machines play draw poker, where the player bets, a hand is dealt, and the player can discard and replace cards. Payout is dependent on the hand resulting after the draw and the player&#x27;s initial bet.

Strip poker is a traditional poker variation where players remove clothing when they lose bets. Since it depends only on the basic mechanic of betting in rounds, strip poker can be played with any form of poker; however, it is usually based on simple variants with few betting rounds, like five card draw.

Another game with the &quot;poker&quot; name, but with a vastly different mode of play, is called &quot;Acey-Deucey&quot; or &quot;Red Dog&quot; poker. This game is more similar to Blackjack in its layout and betting; each player bets against the house, and then is dealt two cards. For the player to win, the third card dealt (after an opportunity to raise the bet) must have a value in-between the first two. Payout is based on the odds that this is possible, based on the difference in values of the first two cards. Other poker-like games played at casinos against the house include three card poker and pai gow poker.

==Computer programs==
A variety of computer poker players have been developed by researchers at the University of Alberta, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Auckland amongst others.

In a January 2015 article published in &quot;Science&quot;, a group of researchers mostly from the University of Alberta announced that they &quot;essentially weakly solved&quot; heads-up limit &quot;Texas Hold &#x27;em&quot; with their development of their Cepheus poker bot. The authors claimed that Cepheus would lose at most 0.001 big blinds per game on average against its worst-case opponent, and the strategy is thus so &quot;close to optimal&quot; that &quot;it can&#x27;t be beaten with statistical significance within a lifetime of human poker playing.&quot;

<text>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.
Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal language. Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs, namely an interpreter or a compiler. An interpreter directly executes the source code, while a compiler produces an executable program.

Computer architecture has strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most common type (imperative languages—which implement operations in a specified order) developed to perform well on the popular von Neumann architecture. While early programming languages were closely tied to the hardware, over time they have developed more abstraction to hide implementation details for greater simplicity.

Thousands of programming languages—often classified as imperative, functional, logic, or object-oriented—have been developed for a wide variety of uses. Many aspects of programming language design involve tradeoffs—for example, exception handling simplifies error handling, but at a performance cost. Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.

==Definitions==
Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are used for interaction between people, while programming languages are designed to allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.

The term &quot;computer language&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;programming language&quot;. However, usage of these terms varies among authors.

In one usage, programming languages are described as a subset of computer languages. Similarly, the term &quot;computer language&quot; may be used in contrast to the term &quot;programming language&quot; to describe languages used in computing but not considered programming languages. Most practical programming languages are Turing complete, and as such are equivalent in what programs they can compute.

Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources. John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.

==History==

===Early developments===
The first programmable computers were invented at the end of the 1940s, and with them, the first programming languages. The earliest computers were programmed in first-generation programming languages (1GLs), machine language (simple instructions that could be directly executed by the processor). This code was very difficult to debug and was not portable between different computer systems. In order to improve the ease of programming, assembly languages (or second-generation programming languages—2GLs) were invented, diverging from the machine language to make programs easier to understand for humans, although they did not increase portability.

Initially, hardware resources were scarce and expensive, while human resources were cheaper. Therefore, cumbersome languages that were time-consuming to use, but were closer to the hardware for higher efficiency were favored. The introduction of high-level programming languages (third-generation programming languages—3GLs)—revolutionized programming. These languages abstracted away the details of the hardware, instead being designed to express algorithms that could be understood more easily by humans. For example, arithmetic expressions could now be written in symbolic notation and later translated into machine code that the hardware could execute. In 1957, Fortran (FORmula TRANslation) was invented. Often considered the first compiled high-level programming language, Fortran has remained in use into the twenty-first century.

===1960s and 1970s===

Around 1960, the first mainframes—general purpose computers—were developed, although they could only be operated by professionals and the cost was extreme. The data and instructions were input by punch cards, meaning that no input could be added while the program was running. The languages developed at this time therefore are designed for minimal interaction. After the invention of the microprocessor, computers in the 1970s became dramatically cheaper. New computers also allowed more user interaction, which was supported by newer programming languages.

Lisp, implemented in 1958, was the first functional programming language. Unlike Fortran, it supported recursion and conditional expressions, and it also introduced dynamic memory management on a heap and automatic garbage collection. For the next decades, Lisp dominated artificial intelligence applications. In 1978, another functional language, ML, introduced inferred types and polymorphic parameters.

After ALGOL (ALGOrithmic Language) was released in 1958 and 1960, it became the standard in computing literature for describing algorithms. Although its commercial success was limited, most popular imperative languages—including C, Pascal, Ada, C++, Java, and C#—are directly or indirectly descended from ALGOL 60. Among its innovations adopted by later programming languages included greater portability and the first use of context-free, BNF grammar. Simula, the first language to support object-oriented programming (including subtypes, dynamic dispatch, and inheritance), also descends from ALGOL and achieved commercial success. C, another ALGOL descendant, has sustained popularity into the twenty-first century. C allows access to lower-level machine operations more than other contemporary languages. Its power and efficiency, generated in part with flexible pointer operations, comes at the cost of making it more difficult to write correct code.

Prolog, designed in 1972, was the first logic programming language, communicating with a computer using formal logic notation. With logic programming, the programmer specifies a desired result and allows the interpreter to decide how to achieve it.

===1980s to 2000s===
During the 1980s, the invention of the personal computer transformed the roles for which programming languages were used. New languages introduced in the 1980s included C++, a superset of C that can compile C programs but also supports classes and inheritance. Ada and other new languages introduced support for concurrency. The Japanese government invested heavily into the so-called fifth-generation languages that added support for concurrency to logic programming constructs, but these languages were outperformed by other concurrency-supporting languages.

Due to the rapid growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web in the 1990s, new programming languages were introduced to support Web pages and networking. Java, based on C++ and designed for increased portability across systems and security, enjoyed large-scale success because these features are essential for many Internet applications. Another development was that of dynamically typed scripting languages—Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby—designed to quickly produce small programs that coordinate existing applications. Due to their integration with HTML, they have also been used for building web pages hosted on servers.

===2000s to present===

During the 2000s, there was a slowdown in the development of new programming languages that achieved widespread popularity. One innovation was service-oriented programming, designed to exploit distributed systems whose components are connected by a network. Services are similar to objects in object-oriented programming, but run on a separate process. C# and F# cross-pollinated ideas between imperative and functional programming. After 2010, several new languages—Rust, Go, Swift, Zig and Carbon —competed for the performance-critical software for which C had historically been used. Most of the new programming languages use static typing while a few numbers of new languages use dynamic typing like Ring and Julia.

Some of the new programming languages are classified as visual programming languages like Scratch, LabVIEW and PWCT. Also, some of these languages mix between textual and visual programming usage like Ballerina. Also, this trend lead to developing projects that help in developing new VPLs like Blockly by Google. Many game engines like Unreal and Unity added support for visual scripting too.

==Elements==
Every programming language includes fundamental elements for describing data and the operations or transformations applied to them, such as adding two numbers or selecting an item from a collection. These elements are governed by syntactic and semantic rules that define their structure and meaning, respectively.

===Syntax===

A programming language&#x27;s surface form is known as its syntax. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, some programming languages are graphical, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.

The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either formal or hard-coded in a reference implementation). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.

The programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions (for lexical structure) and Backus–Naur form (for grammatical structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on Lisp:

expression ::= atom | list
atom ::= number | symbol
number ::= [+-]?[&#x27;0&#x27;-&#x27;9&#x27;]+
symbol ::= [&#x27;A&#x27;-&#x27;Z&quot;a&#x27;-&#x27;z&#x27;].*
list ::= &#x27;(&#x27; expression* &#x27;)&#x27;
This grammar specifies the following:
* an &quot;expression&quot; is either an &quot;atom&quot; or a &quot;list&quot;;
* an &quot;atom&quot; is either a &quot;number&quot; or a &quot;symbol&quot;;
* a &quot;number&quot; is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;
* a &quot;symbol&quot; is a letter followed by zero or more of any alphabetical characters (excluding whitespace); and
* a &quot;list&quot; is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more &quot;expressions&quot; inside it.

The following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3.

Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language&#x27;s rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit undefined behavior. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.

Using natural language as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:
* &quot;Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.&quot; is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.
* &quot;John is a married bachelor.&quot; is grammatically well-formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.

The following C language fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation codice_4 has no meaning for a value having a complex type and codice_5 is not defined because the value of codice_6 is the null pointer):
complex *p = NULL;
complex abs_p = sqrt(*p » 4 + p-&gt;im);
If the type declaration on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on the undefined variable codice_6 during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.

The grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the Chomsky hierarchy. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are context-free grammars. Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase. Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an undecidable problem, and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution. In contrast to Lisp&#x27;s macro system and Perl&#x27;s codice_8 blocks, which may contain general computations, C macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution.

===Semantics===

The term &quot;semantics&quot; refers to the meaning of languages, as opposed to their form (syntax).

====Static semantics====
Static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms. For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time. Examples include checking that every identifier is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a case statement are distinct. Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that subroutine calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a logic called a type system. Other forms of static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part of static semantics. Programming languages such as Java and C# have definite assignment analysis, a form of data flow analysis, as part of their respective static semantics.

====Dynamic semantics====
Once data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the strategy by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which control structures conditionally execute statements. The &quot;dynamic semantics&quot; (also known as &quot;execution semantics&quot;) of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research goes into formal semantics of programming languages, which allows execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.

===Type system===
A data type is a set of allowable values and operations that can be performed on these values. Each programming language&#x27;s type system defines which data types exist, the type of an expression, and how type equivalence and type compatibility function in the language.

According to type theory, a language is fully typed if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable. In contrast, an untyped language, such as most assembly languages, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally sequences of bits of various lengths. In practice, while few languages are fully typed, most offer a degree of typing. 

Because different types (such as integers and floats) represent values differently, unexpected results will occur if one type is used when another is expected. Type checking will flag this error, usually at compile time (runtime type checking is more costly). With strong typing, type errors can always be detected unless variables are explicitly cast to a different type. Weak typing occurs when languages allow implicit casting—for example, to enable operations between variables of different types without the programmer making an explicit type conversion. The more cases in which this type coercion is allowed, the fewer type errors can be detected. 
====Commonly supported types====

Early programming languages often supported only built-in, numeric types such as the integer (signed and unsigned) and floating point (to support operations on real numbers that are not integers). Most programming languages support multiple sizes of floats (often called float and double) and integers depending on the size and precision required by the programmer. Storing an integer in a type that is too small to represent it leads to integer overflow. The most common way of representing negative numbers with signed types is twos complement, although ones complement is also used. Other common types include Boolean—which is either true or false—and character—traditionally one byte, sufficient to represent all ASCII characters. 

Arrays are a data type whose elements, in many languages, must consist of a single type of fixed length. Other languages define arrays as references to data stored elsewhere and support elements of varying types. Depending on the programming language, sequences of multiple characters, called strings, may be supported as arrays of characters or their own primitive type. Strings may be of fixed or variable length, which enables greater flexibility at the cost of increased storage space and more complexity. Other data types that may be supported include lists, associative (unordered) arrays accessed via keys, records in which data is mapped to names in an ordered structure, and tuples—similar to records but without names for data fields. Pointers store memory addresses, typically referencing locations on the heap where other data is stored.

The simplest user-defined type is an ordinal type, often called an enumeration, whose values can be mapped onto the set of positive integers. Since the mid-1980s, most programming languages also support abstract data types, in which the representation of the data and operations are hidden from the user, who can only access an interface. The benefits of data abstraction can include increased reliability, reduced complexity, less potential for name collision, and allowing the underlying data structure to be changed without the client needing to alter its code.

====Static and dynamic typing====
In static typing, all expressions have their types determined before a program executes, typically at compile-time. Most widely used, statically typed programming languages require the types of variables to be specified explicitly. In some languages, types are implicit; one form of this is when the compiler can infer types based on context. The downside of implicit typing is the potential for errors to go undetected. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with functional languages such as Haskell and ML. 

With dynamic typing, the type is not attached to the variable but only the value encoded in it. A single variable can be reused for a value of a different type. Although this provides more flexibility to the programmer, it is at the cost of lower reliability and less ability for the programming language to check for errors. Some languages allow variables of a union type to which any type of value can be assigned, in an exception to their usual static typing rules.

===Concurrency===

In computing, multiple instructions can be executed simultaneously. Many programming languages support instruction-level and subprogram-level concurrency. By the twenty-first century, additional processing power on computers was increasingly coming from the use of additional processors, which requires programmers to design software that makes use of multiple processors simultaneously to achieve improved performance. Interpreted languages such as Python and Ruby do not support the concurrent use of multiple processors. Other programming languages do support managing data shared between different threads by controlling the order of execution of key instructions via the use of semaphores, controlling access to shared data via monitor, or enabling message passing between threads.
===Exception handling===

Many programming languages include exception handlers, a section of code triggered by runtime errors that can deal with them in two main ways:
*Termination: shutting down and handing over control to the operating system. This option is considered the simplest.
*Resumption: resuming the program near where the exception occurred. This can trigger a repeat of the exception, unless the exception handler is able to modify values to prevent the exception from reoccurring.
Some programming languages support dedicating a block of code to run regardless of whether an exception occurs before the code is reached; this is called finalization.

There is a tradeoff between increased ability to handle exceptions and reduced performance. For example, even though array index errors are common C does not check them for performance reasons. Although programmers can write code to catch user-defined exceptions, this can clutter a program. Standard libraries in some languages, such as C, use their return values to indicate an exception. Some languages and their compilers have the option of turning on and off error handling capability, either temporarily or permanently.

==Design and implementation==

One of the most important influences on programming language design has been computer architecture. Imperative languages, the most commonly used type, were designed to perform well on von Neumann architecture, the most common computer architecture. In von Neumann architecture, the memory stores both data and instructions, while the CPU that performs instructions on data is separate, and data must be piped back and forth to the CPU. The central elements in these languages are variables, assignment, and iteration, which is more efficient than recursion on these machines. 

Many programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. The birth of programming languages in the 1950s was stimulated by the desire to make a universal programming language suitable for all machines and uses, avoiding the need to write code for different computers. By the early 1960s, the idea of a universal language was rejected due to the differing requirements of the variety of purposes for which code was written. 

===Tradeoffs===
Desirable qualities of programming languages include readability, writability, and reliability. These features can reduce the cost of training programmers in a language, the amount of time needed to write and maintain programs in the language, the cost of compiling the code, and increase runtime performance. 
*Although early programming languages often prioritized efficiency over readability, the latter has grown in importance since the 1970s. Having multiple operations to achieve the same result can be detrimental to readability, as is overloading operators, so that the same operator can have multiple meanings. Another feature important to readability is orthogonality, limiting the number of constructs that a programmer has to learn. A syntax structure that is easily understood and special words that are immediately obvious also supports readability.
*Writability is the ease of use for writing code to solve the desired problem. Along with the same features essential for readability, abstraction—interfaces that enable hiding details from the client—and expressivity—enabling more concise programs—additionally help the programmer write code. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer, but over time support for abstraction has increased, allowing programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. Most programming languages come with a standard library of commonly used functions.
*Reliability means that a program performs as specified in a wide range of circumstances. Type checking, exception handling, and restricted aliasing (multiple variable names accessing the same region of memory) all can improve a program&#x27;s reliability.
Programming language design often involves tradeoffs. For example, features to improve reliability typically come at the cost of performance. Increased expressivity due to a large number of operators makes writing code easier but comes at the cost of readability.
Natural-language programming has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming. However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate. Edsger W. Dijkstra took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs. Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea. 
===Specification===
The specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language, and if so what its behavior shall be.

A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following:
* An explicit definition of the syntax, static semantics, and execution semantics of the language. While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in natural language (e.g., as in the C language), or a formal semantics (e.g., as in Standard ML and Scheme specifications).
* A description of the behavior of a translator for the language (e.g., the C++ and Fortran specifications). The syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description, which may be written in natural or formal language.
* A &quot;reference&quot; or &quot;model&quot; implementation, sometimes written in the language being specified (e.g., Prolog or ANSI REXX). The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation.

===Implementation===
An implementation of a programming language is the conversion of a program into machine code that can be executed by the hardware. The machine code then can be executed with the help of the operating system. The most common form of interpretation in production code is by a compiler, which translates the source code via an intermediate-level language into machine code, known as an executable. Once the program is compiled, it will run more quickly than with other implementation methods. Some compilers are able to provide further optimization to reduce memory or computation usage when the executable runs, but increasing compilation time.

Another implementation method is to run the program with an interpreter, which translates each line of software into machine code just before it executes. Although it can make debugging easier, the downside of interpretation is that it runs 10 to 100 times slower than a compiled executable. Hybrid interpretation methods provide some of the benefits of compilation and some of the benefits of interpretation via partial compilation. One form this takes is just-in-time compilation, in which the software is compiled ahead of time into an intermediate language, and then into machine code immediately before execution.

==Proprietary languages==
Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly domain-specific languages or internal scripting languages for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.

Some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, Oracle Corporation asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the Java programming language, and Microsoft&#x27;s C# programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has Common Language Runtime (CLR) as a closed environment.

Many proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include MATLAB, VBScript, and Wolfram Language. Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example, Erlang was originally Ericsson&#x27;s internal programming language.

Open source programming languages are particularly helpful for open science applications, enhancing the capacity for replication and code sharing.

==Use==
Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field.
Individual software projects commonly use five programming languages or more.

Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers &quot;do exactly what they are told to do&quot;, and cannot &quot;understand&quot; what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program&#x27;s inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode, which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.

A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A programmer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called primitives). &quot;Programming&quot; is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment.

Programs for a computer might be executed in a batch process without human interaction, or a user might type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter. In this case the &quot;commands&quot; are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a Unix shell or other command-line interface), without compiling, it is called a scripting language.

===Measuring language usage===

Determining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one has more lines of code, and a third may consume the most CPU time. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example, COBOL is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large mainframes; Fortran in scientific and engineering applications; Ada in aerospace, transportation, military, real-time, and embedded applications; and C in embedded applications and operating systems. Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.

Various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed:
* counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language
* the number of books sold that teach or describe the language
* estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches
* counts of language references (i.e., to the name of the language) found using a web search engine.

Combining and averaging information from various internet sites, stackify.com reported the ten most popular programming languages (in descending order by overall popularity): Java, C, C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, VB .NET, R, PHP, and MATLAB.

As of June 2024, the top five programming languages as measured by TIOBE index are Python, C++, C, Java and C#. TIOBE provide a list of top 100 programming languages according to popularity and update this list every month.

==Dialects, flavors and implementations==
A dialect of a programming language or a data exchange language is a (relatively small) variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature. With languages such as Scheme and Forth, standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate, or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new dialect. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a domain-specific language, often a subset. In the Lisp world, most languages that use basic S-expression syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly as do, say, Racket and Clojure. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The BASIC language has many dialects.

==Classifications==

Programming languages are often placed into four main categories: imperative, functional, logic, and object oriented.
*Imperative languages are designed to implement an algorithm in a specified order; they include visual programming languages such as .NET for generating graphical user interfaces. Scripting languages, which are partly or fully interpreted rather than compiled, are sometimes considered a separate category but meet the definition of imperative languages.
*Functional programming languages work by successively applying functions to the given parameters. Although appreciated by many researchers for their simplicity and elegance, problems with efficiency have prevented them from being widely adopted.
*Logic languages are designed so that the software, rather than the programmer, decides what order in which the instructions are executed.
*Object-oriented programming—whose characteristic features are data abstraction, inheritance, and dynamic dispatch—is supported by most popular imperative languages and some functional languages.
Although markup languages are not programming languages, some have extensions that support limited programming. Additionally, there are special-purpose languages that are not easily compared to other programming languages.

<doc id="23019" wikidata="Q912121" url="?curid=23019" title="Economy of Poland">
<text>The economy of Poland is an emerging and developing, high-income, industrialized, mixed economy that serves as the sixth-largest in the European Union by nominal GDP and fifth-largest by GDP (PPP). Poland boasts the extensive public services characteristic of most developed economies and is one of few countries in Europe to provide no tuition fees for undergraduate and postgraduate education and with universal public healthcare that is free at a point of use. Since 1988, Poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalisation but retained an advanced public welfare system. It ranks 19th worldwide in terms of GDP (PPP), 21st in terms of GDP (nominal), and 21st in the 2023 Economic Complexity Index. Among OECD nations, Poland has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at roughly 22.7% of GDP.

The largest component of Poland&#x27;s economy is the service sector (62.3%), followed by industry (34.2%) and agriculture (3.5%). Following the economic reform of 1989, Poland&#x27;s external debt has increased from $42.2 billion in 1989 to $365.2 billion in 2014. Poland shipped US$224.6 billion worth of goods around the globe in 2017, while exports increased to US$221.4 billion. The country&#x27;s top export goods include machinery, electronic equipment, vehicles, furniture, and plastics. Poland was the only economy in the EU to avoid a recession through the 2007–08 economic downturn.

As of 2019, the Polish economy had been growing steadily for 28 years, a record high in the EU. This record was only surpassed by Australia in the world economy. GDP per capita at purchasing power parity has grown on average by 6% p.a. over the last 20 years, the highest in Central Europe. Poland&#x27;s GDP has increased seven-fold since 1990.

==History==
Poland has seen the largest increase in GDP per capita (more than 100%) both among the former Eastern Bloc countries, and compared to the EU-15 (around 45%). It has had uninterrupted economic growth since 1992, even after the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

===Before 1989===
This article discusses the economy of post-1989 Poland. For a historical overview see:
* Economy of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795)
* Economy of the Second Polish Republic (1918–1939)
* Economy of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland (1945–1989)
===1990–2009===
The Polish state steadfastly pursued a policy of economic liberalization throughout the 1990s, with positive results for economic growth but negative results for some sectors of the population. The privatization of small and medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms has encouraged the development of the private business sector, which has been the main drive for Poland&#x27;s economic growth. The agricultural sector remained constrained by structural problems, surplus labour, inefficient small farms, and a lack of investment. Restructuring and privatization of &quot;sensitive sectors&quot; (e.g. coal), has also been slow, but foreign investments in energy and steel have begun to turn the tide. Also, reforms in healthcare, education, the pension system, and state administration have resulted in larger than expected fiscal pressures. Improving this account deficit and tightening monetary policy, with a focus on inflation, are priorities for the Polish government. Further progress in public finance depends mainly on the reduction of public sector employment, and an overhaul of the tax code to incorporate farmers, who currently pay significantly lower taxes than other people with similar income levels.
===Since the 2009 financial crisis===
Since the global recession of 2009, Poland&#x27;s GDP has continued to grow. In 2009, at the high point of the crisis, the GDP for the European Union as a whole dropped by 4.5% while Polish GDP increased by 1.6%. As of November 2013, the size of the EU&#x27;s economy remains below the pre-crisis level, while Poland&#x27;s economy increased by a cumulative 16%. The major reasons for its success appear to be a large internal market (in terms of population it is sixth in the EU) and a business-friendly political climate. The economic reforms implemented after the fall of communism in the 1990s have also played a role; between 1989 and 2007 Poland&#x27;s economy grew by 177%, faster than other countries in Eastern and Central Europe, while at the same time millions were left without work.

However, the economic fluctuations of the business cycle did affect Poland&#x27;s unemployment rate, which by early 2013 reached almost 11%. This level was still below European average and has begun falling subsequently. As of October 2017, Poland&#x27;s unemployment rate stood at 4.6% according to Eurostat.

==Economic growth==
In the period from 1989 to 2018, Poland&#x27;s GDP increased by 826.96% and it was the best result in Europe. In the same period, Ireland&#x27;s GDP grew by 789.43%, Slovakia&#x27;s by 783.83% and the Czech Republic by 549.47%. In 1990, the Polish national income amounted to USD 65.978 billion, and by 2017 it had increased to USD 524.5 billion. Achieving these results was possible thanks to the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, the development of private entrepreneurship, but also the rapid increase in work efficiency and openness to foreign direct investments. In 2018, the Polish economy grew by 5.1% compared to 4.8% in 2017. Economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 in Poland amounted to 4.9% on an annual basis and compared to the third quarter, where GDP increased by 5.1%, it was slightly lower. During this period, investments increased by 6.7%, private consumption also increased by 4.3%, and domestic demand increased by 4.8%. The PMI index in January 2019 was 48.2 points and was higher than in December 2018 when it amounted to 47.6 points.

==Data==
The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022–2027). Inflation under 5% is in green.
==Labour market and wages==
Unemployment in Poland became a major problem after the Revolutions of 1989, which collapsed communism in Poland, although the economy previously had high levels of hidden unemployment. The unemployment rate then fell to 10% by the late 1990s and then increased again in the first few years of the 21st century, reaching a peak of 20% in 2002. It has since decreased, although unevenly. Since 2008 the unemployment rate in Poland has consistently been below European average.

The rate fell below 8% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2019 leading to a labour deficit.

==Foreign trade and FDI==
With the collapse of the ruble-based COMECON trade bloc in 1991, Poland reoriented its trade. As early as 1996, 70% of its trade was with EU members. Neighbouring Germany is Poland&#x27;s main trading partner today. Poland joined the European Union in May 2004. Before that, it fostered regional integration and trade through the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), which included Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

Poland is a founding member of the World Trade Organization. As a member of the European Union, it applies the common external tariff to goods from other countries including the United States. Poland&#x27;s major imports are capital goods needed for industrial retooling and for manufacturing inputs. The country&#x27;s exports also include machinery but are highly diversified. The most successful exports are furniture, foods, motor boats, light planes, hardwood products, casual clothing, shoes, and cosmetics. Germany is by far the biggest importer of Poland&#x27;s exports as of 2013. In the agricultural sector, the biggest money-makers abroad include smoked and fresh fish, fine chocolate, dairy products, meats, and specialty breads, with the exchange rate conducive to export growth. Food exports amounted to 62 billion złoty in 2011, increasing by 17% from 2010. Most Polish exports to the U.S. receive tariff benefits under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) program. Poland ranks in the top 20 in the world both in terms of exports and imports, recording a clear trade surplus.

Poland is less dependent on external trade than most other Central and Eastern European countries, but its volume of trade with Europe is still substantial. In 2011 the volume of trade (exports plus imports) with the Eurozone as share of GDP was 40%, a doubling from the mid 1990s. 30% of Poland&#x27;s exports are to Germany and another 30% to the rest of Europe. There has been substantial increase in Poland&#x27;s exports to Russia. However, in August 2014, exports of fruits and vegetables to Russia fell dramatically following its politically motivated ban by Moscow.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) was at 40% of GDP in 2010, a doubling over the level in 2000. Most FDI into Poland comes from France, Germany, and the Netherlands. Polish firms in turn have foreign investments primarily in Italy and Luxembourg. Most of the internal FDI is in manufacturing, which makes it susceptible to economic fluctuations in the source countries.

The UAE is Poland&#x27;s largest trading partner in the Arab world.

The government offers investors various forms of state aid, such as CIT tax at the level of 19% and investment incentives in 14 Special Economic Zones (among others: income tax exemption, real estate tax exemption, competitive land prices), several industrial and technology parks, the possibility to benefit from the EU structural funds, brownfield and greenfield locations. According to the National Bank of Poland (NBP), the level of FDI inflow into Poland in 2006 amounted to €13.9 billion.

According to an Ernst &amp; Young report, Poland ranks 7th in the world in terms of investment attractiveness. However, Ernst &amp; Young&#x27;s 2010 European attractiveness survey reported that Poland saw a 52% decrease in FDI job creation and a 42% decrease in number of FDI projects since 2008. According to an OECD report, in 2004 Poland was one of the hardest-working nations in Europe. In 2010, the World Economic Forum ranked Poland near the bottom of OECD countries in terms of the clarity, efficiency, and neutrality of the legal framework used by firms to settle disputes.

==Sectors==
, the Polish economy is dominated by the services sector, with 615,647 registered companies, followed by 329,255 companies in finance, insurance, and real estate and 176,149 companies in retail trade.

===Production industries===



Before World War II, Poland&#x27;s industrial base was concentrated in the coal, textile, chemical, machinery, iron, and steel sectors. Today it extends to fertilizers, petrochemicals, machine tools, electrical machinery, electronics, car manufacturing, and shipbuilding.

Poland&#x27;s industrial base suffered greatly during World War II, and many resources were directed toward reconstruction. The socialist economic system imposed in the late 1940s created large and unwieldy economic structures&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland 11/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; operated under a tight central command. In part because of this systemic rigidity, the economy performed poorly even in comparison with other economies in Central Europe.

In 1990, the Tadeusz Mazowiecki government began a comprehensive reform programme to replace the centralised command economy with a market-oriented system. While the results overall have been impressive, many large state-owned industrial enterprises, particularly the rail, mining, steel, and defence sectors, have remained resistant to change and the downsizing required to survive in a market-based economy.

====Energy====
====Pharmaceuticals====
The pharmaceutical market is worth 50 billion PLN as of , an increase of 9.5% over the previous year.

The non-prescription medicine market, which accounts for about one-third of the total market value, was worth PLN 7.5bn in 2008. This value includes drugs and non-drugs such as dietary supplements, cosmetics, dressings, dental materials, diagnostic tests, and medical devices. The prescription medicines market was worth PLN 15.8bn.

===Mining===
, the country was the world&#x27;s 3rd largest producer of rhenium, 5th largest producer of silver, the 13th largest producer of copper, the 14th largest producer of sulfur,and the 14th largest producer of salt.

===Agriculture===

Agriculture employs 8.2% of the workforce but contributes 3.8% to GDP, reflecting relatively low productivity. Unlike the industrial sector, Poland&#x27;s agricultural sector remained largely in private hands during the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. Most of the former state farms are now leased to farmer tenants. Lack of credit is hampering efforts to sell former state farmland. Currently, Poland&#x27;s 2 million private farms occupy 90% of all farmland and account for roughly the same percentage of total agricultural production. Farms are small—8 hectares on average—and often fragmented. Farms with an area exceeding 15 ha accounted for 9% of the total number of farms but cover 45% of total agricultural area. Over half of all farm households in Poland produce only for their own needs with little, if any, commercial sales.

Poland is a net exporter of processed fruit and vegetables, meat, and dairy products. Processors often rely on imports to supplement domestic supplies of wheat, feed grains, vegetable oil, and protein meals, which are generally insufficient to meet domestic demand. However, Poland is the leading EU producer of potatoes and rye and is one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of sugar beets and triticale. Poland is also a significant producer of rapeseed, grains, hogs, and cattle. Poland is the sixth-largest producer and exporter of apples in the entire world.

===Tourism===

After acceding to the EU in 2004, tourism grew in Poland. Most tourist attractions in Poland are connected with natural environment, historic sites, and cultural events. They draw millions of tourists every year from all around the world. According to Tourist Institute&#x27;s data, Poland was visited by 15.7 million tourists in 2006, and by 15 million tourists in 2007, out of the total number of 66.2 million foreign visitors. In 2016 the number of arrivals to Poland amounted to 80.5 million. 17.5 million of this number are arrivals considered for tourism purposes (with at least one night&#x27;s stay), making it the 16th most visited country in the world. The most popular cities are Kraków, Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Łódź, Poznań, Szczecin, Lublin, Toruń, Sopot, Zakopane, and the Wieliczka Salt Mine. The best recreational destinations include Poland&#x27;s Masurian Lake District, Baltic Sea coast, Tatra Mountains (the highest mountain range of the Carpathians), Sudetes, and Białowieża Forest. Poland&#x27;s main tourist offers consist of sightseeing within cities and out-of-town historical monuments, business trips, qualified tourism, agrotourism, mountain hiking (trekking), and climbing among others.

===Financial sector===
The Polish banking sector is regulated by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA).

While transforming the country to a market-oriented economy during 1992–97, the government privatized some banks, recapitalized the rest, and introduced legal reforms that made the sector competitive. These reforms, and the health and relative stability of the sector, attracted a number of strategic foreign investors. At the beginning of 2009, Poland&#x27;s banking sector had 51 domestic banks, a network of 578 cooperative banks and 18 branches of foreign-owned banks. In addition, foreign investors had controlling stakes in nearly 40 commercial banks, which made up 68% of the banking capital. Banks in Poland reacted to the financial crisis of 2009 by restraining lending, raising interest rates, and strengthening balance sheets. Subsequently, the sector started lending again, with an increase of more than 4% expected in 2011.

===Venture capital===

The segment of the private equity market that finances early-stage high-risk companies, with the potential for fast growth, had 130 active firms in Poland (as of March 2019). Between 2009 and 2019, these entities have invested locally in over 750 companies, an average of 9 companies per portfolio. Since 2016, new legal institutions have been established for entities investing in enterprises in the seed or startup phase. In 2018, venture capital funds invested in Polish startups (0.033% of GDP). As of March 2019, total assets managed by VC companies operating in Poland are estimated at . The total value of investments of the Polish VC market is .

===Transportation===

Poland is served by an extensive network of railways. In most cities, the main railway station is located near a city centre and is well connected to the local transportation system. The infrastructure is operated by Polish State Railways, part of state-run PKP Group. The rail network is very dense in western and northern Poland, while the eastern part of the country is less developed. The capital city, Warsaw, has the country&#x27;s only rapid transit system: the Warsaw Metro.

Poland&#x27;s busiest airport is Warsaw Chopin Airport. Warsaw Chopin serves as the main international hub for Poland&#x27;s flag carrier LOT Polish Airlines. In addition to Warsaw Chopin, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Katowice, Kraków, and Poznań all have international airports. In preparation for the Euro 2012 football championships jointly hosted by Poland and Ukraine, a number of airports around the country were renovated and redeveloped. This included the building of new terminals with an increased number of jetways and stands at both Wrocław Airport in Wrocław and Lech Wałęsa Airport in Gdańsk.

Poland has 412,264 km (256,170 mi) of public roads. Polish public roads are categorised by administrative division, which include national roads, voivodeship roads, Powiat roads, and Gmina roads. Motorways and expressways are part of the national road network. As of February 2025, there are 5,205.5 km of motorways and expressways in use.

==Budget and debt==

The public and private debt levels of Poland are below the European average (2017).

==GDP growth in Poland==
Recent GDP growth (comparing to the same quarter of previous year): 
==Location==
Poland has an excellent location for transporting locally made components or products to the rest of Europe. For example, when moving production from China, the new factory in Poland can move their goods in 24 hours to the most populated parts of Europe, and in 48 hours to all of Europe.

==Potential of the Polish economy in the EU==
Poland, measured by the purchasing power parity index, is the sixth-largest economy in the European Union and the eighth-largest economy in Europe, slightly ahead of the Netherlands.

Poland recorded GDP growth even during the 2008–09 financial crisis. The unemployment rate in the country remains very low and amounted to 5% in September 2023.

Although the Polish economy is catching up with the countries of Western Europe, this process is progressing slowly. So far, taking into account the level of social development, Poland has managed to overtake Portugal. There is a great deal of variation between regions. Masovian Voivodeship is on a similar level to the richest regions of Spain and most regions of France (82% of the EU average). However, it should be remembered that the GDP of this voivodeship is mainly generated by Warsaw. Lower Silesian Voivodeship with a GDP of $16,000 is on par with Portugal and the regions of Spain and Greece. Subsequent voivodeships reached about 50% of the EU average, and the poorest voivodships of the eastern wall have GDP per capita comparable to Romania and Bulgaria.

Polish capital has several large concerns in this region of Europe, i.e. PKN Orlen, which has its stations in Germany and Lithuania, Polsat, which also invests in Lithuania, the ITI Group. Poland has a highly developed road network, most of the A1, A2, A4 highways and expressways, including S6 and S7, are fully completed. The next ones are to be ready by 2023. Their construction by private companies is financed in part by the EU. In the coming years, Poland is to receive approximately EUR 4.5 billion for the modernisation of railways.

Poland is one of the key immigration destinations in the EU, having attracted more non-EU immigrants, already in 2021 mostly from Ukraine, than any other EU country for a few consecutive years.

<text>Telecommunications in Poland include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.

==Radio and television==
* Radio stations: 
** State-run public radio operates 5 national networks and 17 regional radio stations; 2 privately owned national radio networks, several commercial stations broadcasting to multiple cities, and many privately owned local radio stations (2007);
** 7 AM, 1138 FM, and 0 shortwave stations (2024).
* Radios: 20.3 million (1997).
* Television stations:
** State-run public TV operates 2 national channels supplemented by 16 regional channels and several niche channels; privately owned entities operate several national TV networks and a number of special interest channels; many privately owned channels broadcast locally; roughly half of all households are linked to either satellite or cable TV systems providing access to foreign television networks (2007); 
** 179 + 256 repeaters (1995).
* Television sets: 13.05 million (1997).

==Telephony==

* Calling code: +48
* International call prefix: 00
* Main lines: 
** 5.3 million lines in use (2022);
** 6.1 million lines in use (2012);
** 10.3 million lines in use (2007).
* Mobile cellular: 
** 53.05 million lines (2024)
** 50.6 million lines (2021);
** 50.8 million lines (2012);
** 45.0 million lines (2009).
* Telephone system: modernization of the telecommunications network has accelerated with market-based competition; fixed-line service, dominated by the former state-owned company, is dwarfed by the growth in mobile-cellular services; mobile-cellular service available since 1993 and provided by three nationwide networks with a fourth provider beginning operations in late 2006; coverage is generally good with some gaps in the east; fixed-line service lags in rural areas; international direct dialing with automated exchanges (2011). 
* Satellite earth stations: 1 with access to Intelsat, Eutelsat, Inmarsat, and Intersputnik (2011).

The market for fixed-line telephony services and infrastructure was monopolized by the state until 1990. The state monopoly was implemented by the PPTiT which was subordinated to the Ministry of Communications. The telephony segments of that entity were spun-off and incorporated into Telekomunikacja Polska, which was later privatized and sold to Orange Polska. The Telecommunications Act of 1990 allowed the provision of telecommunication infrastructure and services by the former monopoly. After 2000, other operators were allowed to use TP&#x27;s telecommunications infrastructure under Third-party Access.

From the communist era Poland inherited an underdeveloped and outmoded system of telephones, with some areas (e.g. in the extreme South East) being served by manual exchanges. In December 2005 the last analog exchange was shut down. All telephone lines are now served by modern fully computerized exchanges (Siemens EWSD, Alcatel S12, Lucent 5ESS, Alcatel E10). The former state owned telephone monopoly (TPSA) has been mostly privatized, with France Telecom buying the largest share. Various other companies have entered the fixed phone market, but generally aiming for niches (e.g. Sferia with fixed wireless, Netia covering primarily business). Whilst prices have reduced and availability has increased considerably since the introduction of competition, there is little sign of TPSA&#x27;s market share being seriously reduced.

There are three competing networks with similar market share, T-Mobile (T-Mobile and Heyah brands), Orange Polska (Orange and nju brands) and Plus (Plus and plush brands). The fourth network, Play, started offering UMTS network services in early 2007. 

As of 2022, all mobile operators run nationwide LTE . Play, Plus, and Orange have nationwide UMTS coverage. Plus also offers full 5G coverage in most cities on 2.6 GHz 

The auction for the 5G network in the n78 band has been ended and the commercial launch of the network is expected at the end of 2023

==Internet==

<text>Transport in Poland involves air, water, road and rail transportation. The country has a large network of municipal public transport, such as buses, trams and the metro. As a country located at the &#x27;cross-roads&#x27; of Europe, Poland is a nation with a large and increasingly modern network of transport infrastructure.

The country&#x27;s most important waterway is the Vistula river. The largest seaports are the Port of Gdańsk, the Port of Gdynia and the Port of Szczecin. Air travel is generally used for international travel, with many flights originating at Warsaw Chopin Airport. Railways connect all of Poland&#x27;s major cities and the state-owned Polish State Railways (PKP) corporation, through its subsidiaries, runs a great number of domestic and international services of varying speed and comfort. In addition to this, five out of sixteen Polish voivodeships have their own regional rail service providers.

== Rail transport ==



Poland is served by an extensive network of railways. In most cities the main railway station is located near a city centre and is well connected to the local transportation system. The infrastructure is operated by PKP Group. The rail network is very dense in western and northern Poland, while eastern part of the country is less developed. The capital city, Warsaw, has the country&#x27;s only rapid transit system: the Warsaw Metro.

The only high-speed rail line (though by most definitions, real high-speed rail only includes speeds over 200 km/h) in central-eastern Europe is the Central Rail Line (Poland), &quot;Centralna Magistrala Kolejowa&quot; (CMK). It has a length of , and was built in 1971–1977; it links Warsaw with Kraków and Katowice. Most trains on the CMK operate at speeds up to , but since December 2014 new Alstom Pendolino ED250 trains operate on a 90 km section of the CMK at , and improvements under way should raise the authorized speed to on most of the line. In test runs on the CMK in November 2013 a new Pendolino ED250 train set a new Polish speed record of .

Other high-speed lines:

*The Warsaw-Gdańsk-Gdynia railway route is undergoing a major upgrading costing $3 billion, partly funded by the European Investment Bank, including track replacement, realignment of curves and relocation of sections of track to allow speeds up to , modernization of stations, and installation of the most modern ETCS signalling system, which is to be completed in June 2015. In December 2014 new Alstom Pendolino ED250 high-speed trains were put into service between Gdańsk, Warsaw, Katowice and Kraków reducing the rail travel time from Gdańsk to Warsaw to 2 hours 58 minutes, to be reduced in late 2015 to 2 hours 37 minutes.
* Warsaw–Kutno–Poznań–(Berlin) (160 km/h)
* Warsaw–Siedlce–Terespol–(Minsk) (160, 120 km/h) – being upgraded to 160 km/h
* Warsaw–Puławy–Lublin (120, 140 km/h)
* Opole–Wrocław (160 km/h) and further upgraded via Legnica to Berlin and Hamburg

&quot;Projects&quot;
The Warsaw–Łódź line is being upgraded to allow speed up to 160 km/h (in order to bind together the Warsaw–Łódź agglomeration).

Plans were made to construct a new high-speed line (350 km/h) from Warsaw to Poznań and Wrocław with forks in Łódź and Kalisz., but the project was cancelled in November 2011 due to its high cost.

The PKP Group is the fourth largest railway throughout Europe. Trains are run by its different subsidiaries.

==== Broad-gauge railways ====

Except for Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa, and a few very short stretches near border crossings, Poland uses the standard gauge for its railways. Therefore, Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (known by its acronym &quot;LHS&quot;, English: &quot;Broad-gauge steelworks line&quot;) in Sławków is the longest broad-gauge railway line in Poland. The line runs on a single track for almost from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad-gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad-gauge rail system of the countries of the former Soviet Union.

=== Rail system ===
Total: 
*standard gauge : ( electrified; double track)
*broad gauge : 
*narrow gauge (various) : various gauges including , , , and (1998)

As of December 2002 narrow-gauge railways were no longer owned or operated by PKP. They were transferred to regional authorities or became independent companies.

==== Rail links with adjacent countries ====
* Same gauge:
** Czech Republic
** Germany
** Slovakia
* Break-of-gauge – /
** Lithuania
** Belarus
** Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast)
** Ukraine

== Road transport ==


Polish public roads are grouped into categories related to administrative division. Poland has of public roads, of which are unsurfaced (2021):
*National roads (Technical classes A, S, GP and exceptionally G): , unsurfaced
*Voivodeship roads (Classes G, Z and exceptionally GP): , unsurfaced
*Powiat roads (Classes G, Z and exceptionally L): , unsurfaced
*Gmina roads (Classes L, D and exceptionally Z): , unsurfaced

In recent years, the network has been improving and government spending on road construction recently saw a huge increase, due to rapid development of the country and the inflow of European Union funds for infrastructure projects.

=== Motorways and expressways ===

Polish motorways and expressways are part of national roads network. As of December 2021, there are of motorways (&quot;autostrady&quot;, singular - &quot;autostrada&quot;) and of expressways (&quot;drogi ekspresowe&quot;, singular - &quot;droga ekspresowa&quot;).

 Motorways in Poland, (2021):&lt;br&gt;

== Air transport ==

The most important airport in Poland is Warsaw &#x27;Frederic Chopin&#x27; International Airport. Warsaw&#x27;s airport is the main international hub for LOT Polish Airlines.

In addition to Warsaw Chopin, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Katowice, Kraków and Poznań all have international airports.

In preparation for the Euro 2012 football championships jointly hosted by Poland and Ukraine, a number of airports around the country were renovated and redeveloped. This included the building of new terminals with an increased number of jetways and stands at both Wrocław Airport and Lech Wałęsa Airport in Gdańsk.

===Airports===
The Polish airline market was until 2004 a closed market, with bilateral agreements between countries served from the national hub – Warsaw. The regional airports were mostly serving as spokes, and were controlled by PPL, the state-owned airport authority. However, in the 1990s it was decided to deregulate the airport market and abolish the dominant position of PPL. Nearly all local airports (apart from Zielona Góra airport) became separate companies, with local governments involved in their management, which led to the partial decentralisation. Soon after opening of Polish sky for competition, flights &quot;avoiding&quot; the Warsaw hub became more common.

There are twelve passenger airports in operation, and there is also an airport Heringsdorf in German village Garz, 7 kilometers from Polish seaside spa Świnoujście.

== Water transport ==

The country&#x27;s most important waterway is the river Vistula. The largest seaports are the Port of Szczecin and Port of Gdańsk.

Marine transport in Poland has two main sub-groups, riverine and seaborne. On the Baltic Sea coast, a number of large seaports exist to serve the international freight and passenger trade; these are typically deep water ports and are able to serve very large ships, including the ro-ro ferries of Unity Line, Polferries and Stena Line which operate the Poland – Scandinavia passenger lines.

Riverine services operate on almost all major Polish rivers and canals (such as the Danube–Oder and Elbląg canals) as well as on domestic coastal routes.

=== Waterways ===
Poland has of navigable rivers and canals (as of 2009).

=== Ports and harbors ===

* Port of Gdańsk &quot; (Polferries: Gdańsk — Nynäshamn / Ystad)&quot;
* Port of Gdynia &quot; (Stena Line: Gdynia — Karlskrona / Gothenburg&quot; and &quot;Finnlines: Gdynia — Helsinki / Rostock)&quot;
* Port of Szczecin-Świnoujście &quot; (Polferries: Świnoujście — Copenhagen / Ystad / Rønne&quot; and &quot;Unity Line: Świnoujście — Ystad / Trelleborg)&quot;
* Port of Police
* Port of Kołobrzeg
* Port of Ustka

=== Merchant marine ===

Total: 57 ships (1,000 GT or over) totaling 1,120,165 GT/

Ships by type:
bulk 50, cargo 2, chemical tanker 2, roll-on/roll-off 1, short-sea passenger 2
(1999 est.)

== Municipal transport ==
=== Bus ===
Most Polish towns and cities have well-developed municipal bus services. Typically, a city possesses its own local bus service, however, in some cases they have private competitors operating on certain lines upon the agreement with local authorities.

Until the 1990s, interurban connections were operated by a single, state-owned company PKS. Since then, it has been broken into a number of independent national and municipal enterprises. In addition, several private operators emerged. There are two classes of service distinguished by vehicle length:
* &quot;autobus&quot; — longer vehicles (12.0 m and more),
* &quot;bus&quot; — shorter vehicles with smaller capacity, very popular on local connections, run by individual persons and smaller companies.
While they often use the same bus stops, they tend to use different stations.

=== Tram ===

Bigger cities run dense tram networks, which are the primary mean of public transport. Currently, there are 15 systems serving over 30 cities including Bydgoszcz, Gdańsk, Katowice, Kraków, Łódź, Poznań, Szczecin, Warsaw and Wrocław, with the total track length varying from (Silesian Interurbans) to less than (Tramways in Grudziądz). A new network has been constructed in Olsztyn in 2015. See the list of town tramway systems in Poland

Since the 1990s, a number of cities attempts to upgrade certain parts of their networks to the light rail standard (called &quot;szybkie tramwaje&quot;, En. &quot;fast trams&quot;). The most notable investments are Poznań Fast Tram and Kraków Fast Tram with the underground premetro section.

=== Trolleybus ===

Trolleybuses can be found in three cities: Gdynia (with some lines reaching Sopot), Lublin and Tychy.

=== Rapid transit ===

The first metro line was opened in Warsaw in 1995. Part of the second line was opened in 2015. This is part of the country&#x27;s rail transport infrastructure. There is an ongoing debate whether a new metro or premetro should be built in Kraków. The current President of Kraków, Aleksander Miszalski, supports the idea and has declared that first works will commence in 2028.

=== Commuter trains ===
In major Polish cities such as Warsaw and the Tricity area, Commuter (SKM) trains provide efficient connections between the city center and surrounding suburbs or satellite towns. In other cities like Łódź (served by ŁKA) and Kraków (served by SKA), similar commuter rail services operate under different names but follow the same principles and rules.

<text>The Republic of Poland is a Central European country and member of the European Union and NATO, among others. Poland wields considerable influence in Central and Eastern Europe and is a middle power in international affairs. The foreign policy of Poland is based on four basic commitments: to Atlantic co-operation, to European integration, to international development and to international law.

The Polish economy is fairly open and relies strongly on international trade. Since the collapse of communism and its re-establishment as a democratic nation, Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and Western affairs, supporting and establishing friendly foreign relations with both the West and with numerous European countries.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland) looks after the foreign relations of Poland. As of May 2024 the ministry was held by Radosław Sikorski.

==History==
Foreign policy topics are covered in the history articles:
* History of Poland
** History of Poland in the Early Modern era (1569–1795)
** History of Poland (1795–1918), when it was split three ways between Germany, Russia and Austria and had no foreign policy
*** Duchy of Warsaw (1807–1815) a semi-independent country
***History of Poland during World War I
** History of Poland (1918–1939)
**History of Poland (1939–1945)
** History of Poland (1945–1989)
** History of Poland (1989–present)

==Integration with the West and Europe==

After regaining independence in 1989, Poland has ahead on its economic reintegration with the Western world. Poland also has been an active nation in advocating European integration.

In 1994, Poland became an associate member of the European Union (EU) and its defensive arm, the Western European Union (WEU). In 1996, Poland achieved full OECD membership and submitted preliminary documentation for full EU membership.

Poland formally joined the European Union in May 2004, along with the other members of the Visegrád Group.

===NATO membership===
Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz told a 2014 audience at the Wilson Center that Poland sought to join NATO as early as 1992.

In 1997, Poland was invited in the first wave of NATO enlargement at the July 1997 NATO Madrid summit. In March 1999, Poland became a full member of NATO. Poland promoted its NATO candidacy through energetic participation in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program and through intensified individual dialogue with NATO.

Poland was a part of the multinational force in Iraq.

<text>The mass media in Poland consist of several different types of communications media including television, radio, cinema, newspapers, magazines, and Internet. 

The media landscape is very pluralistic but highly polarized along political and ideological divides.

==The media landscape==

According to the 2023 report by Warsaw-based media monitoring firm Instytut Monitorowania Mediów (IMM), the most quoted media outlet was RMF FM radio followed by Wirtualna Polska news portal, Rzeczpospolita daily, TVN24 news station and Radio Zet.The Internet penetration of Poland stands at around 92%. According to the Digital News Report by the Reuters Institute, the top 5 most popular online news outlets in 2023 were: Onet, Wirtualna Polska, TVN24.pl, Interia and RMF24.pl. 

The government is working to increase broadband internet service. The major print, radio and television outlets have online editions. Online-only portals publishing a mix of news and entertainment content are among the country&#x27;s most-visited websites .

The reach of television is widespread. In 2016, the Poles on average watched television for over 4 hours and 20 minutes a day. The public television broadcaster is &quot;Telewizja Polska&quot; (TVP), which runs two main channels, one regional channel and several thematic channels. The TVP is an importante source of information for many Poles, in particular in small cities, though its popularity has been declining in recent years. In the private sector there are over 200 commercial TV broadcasters: the two leading one are Polsat and TVN.

Radio is a popular medium in Poland. In addition to the public radio broadcaster, Polskie Radio (PR), there are over 200 licensed private radio outlets. 

== History and political landscape ==
The oldest Polish newspaper was Merkuriusz Polski, first published in 1661. A number of other dailies were established during the First Polish Republic, including the Monitor and Gazeta Warszawska.

Public radio service and the first national news agency were both founded at the beginning of the 20th century. The first TV broadcaster, Telewizja Polska, launched in 1952.

During the Soviet-imposed communist regime the Stalinist press doctrine dominated and controlled the media. However the country instituted freedom of press since the fall of communism. 

The main features of the media system of modern Poland are the product of the country&#x27;s socio-political and economic post-communist transition. These features include: the privatisation of the press sector; the transformation of the state radio and television into public broadcasting services; influx of foreign capital into the media market and European integration of audiovisual media policies.Since the 1990s, Poland has developed a pluralistic but highly polarized media environment. The media landscape comprises, in addition to the public radio and television broadcasters, a variety of private media outlets, encompassing a broad political spectrum, from socially liberal to ultraconservative.
In the sector of print media, the newspaper with the largest circulation is &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;, founded in 1989. Its founding father was Adam Michnik- a Communist-era dissident. The daily had a critical stance towards the Law and Justice Party (PiS) government. The second largest paper is &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot;, which has conservative traditions.
The two main business-oriented dailies are &quot;Dziennik Gazeta Prawna&quot; and &quot;Puls Biznesu&quot;: they both have a narrow, professional readership and are typically not engaged in the country’ political conflict. The two leading tabloids are &quot;Fakt&quot;, owned by the Swiss-German media conglomerate Axel Springer, and &quot;Super Express&quot;, owned by ZPR Media. These tabloids have a remarkable impact on public opinion.

In addition to national publications, there are several regional dailies: in this sector, the top competitors have sales comprised between 20,000 and 40,000 daily copies sold.

In the recent years, sales of both national and regional dailies have been declining.

Political polarization also characterizes the weekly newsmagazine market. On the liberal side there is &quot;Newsweek Polska&quot; (the Polish edition of the &quot;Newsweek&quot;), followed by &quot;Polityka&quot;. On the right side, there are newer titles&quot;Sieci&quot;, &quot;Do Rzeczy&quot; and the older &quot;Gazeta Polska&quot;. The right-wing weeklies do not form a uniform bloc.

==Legal framework==

The Polish constitution of 1997 guarantees freedom of the press and prohibits both preventive censorship and licensing requirements for the press. The media sector is regulated by the 1984 Polish Press Law and the 1992 Broadcasting Act, which have both been amended since then. The Broadcasting Act defines the rules for appointing the members of the National Broadcasting Council (&quot;Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji&quot;, KRRRiT) and its powers. According to the Constitution, the KRRiT&#x27;s role is to &quot;safeguard the freedom of speech, the right to information, and the public interest in radio and television broadcasting&quot;.

Even is its members are not allowed to belong to political party or perform public activities, the KRRiT in practice has been politicized, with members somehow affiliated with political parties. Also the governments’ reform attempts of the KRRiT have been largely politically driven. These attempts have been strengthened by the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS) government which, after winning the parliamentary elections in October 2015, partly replaced the management at the public television and radio broadcasters.

==Media polarisation==

The Polish media environment is highly polarized. Since 2015 elections, this polarization has become ever stronger. The cleavage concerns both PiS&#x27;s controversial decisions and policies and diverging attitudes towards issues such as equal rights for LGBT people, refugees, the EU.

Poland lacks the tradition of an editorially independent public service media: public and radio television broadcasters tend to favor those in power.

Partisanship in the Polish media system goes hand in hand with bias among the journalists themselves. This bias is mirrored in the two major journalists&#x27;s organizations that have different orientations: the Association of Polish Journalists (SDP), sympathetic toward the PiS government, and the Association of Journalists (TD), which is against the PiS&#x27;s government.
On 7 December 2020 state-owned petroleum refinery and distributor PKN Orlen acquired media and press company &quot;Polska Press&quot; controlling large number of regional media portals and several regional newspapers. Together with previous acquisition of Polish newspaper distributor RUCH it creates a situation where regional media are owned and distributed by state-owned company raising concerns of media neutrality in Poland. On April 8, 2021, a Polish court has suspended the purchase of Polska Press by PKN Orlen.
==Media ownership==

Foreign companies hold a dominant position in the Polish media market. This fact entered into the political debate, in particular since the PiS government took office. To contrast this, Jarosław Kaczyński, founder of the PiS and former Prime Minister, called for the media to be &quot;repolonized&quot; PiS politicians argued that foreign-owned media outlets pursue deliberately unfavorable coverage of the PiS&#x27;s government with the aim of undermining it. 

Polish print media and radio outlets are mainly private and diversified in terms of ownership, however foreign owners control around three-quarters of the Polish media market. The main domestic competitor is Agora, which owns &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot; and a number of magazines, radio stations, internet platforms, a publishing house and additional ventures.

Foreign ownership is very strong also in the regional media which are largely owned by the German Polska Press.

To counter foreign ownership in Polish media, in 2021, the PiS government submitted a bill that would ban non-European-Union citizens and companies from possessing a controlling stake in Polish media outlets. In August 11, 2021, The bill Lex TVN which forbids companies except those from the European Economic Area from holding more than a 49% stake in Polish radio and television stations passed the Sejm.

==Media freedom and pluralism==
In recent years, according to Reporters Without Borders, in particular since the PiS went to power in 2015 and ended in 2023, media freedom in Poland has been significantly deteriorating. 

Several weeks after winning the 2015 parliamentary elections, the PiS passed a media law which gave the government direct control over public broadcasting. It also replaced journalists working in the public radio and TV stations and attempted to throttle several independent print media outlets, such as &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;, &quot;Polityka&quot; and &quot;Newsweek Polska&quot; by restricting public advertising. According to Freedom House, this effort is part of a broader attempt to weaken checks and balances, silence independent voices and control the public sphere. PiS&#x27;s control on the executive branch and the executive can undermine the independence of the judiciary and its aggressive attitude towards the Constitutional Tribunal has prompted accusations that it is undermining the rule of law in Poland. In January 2016, the European Commission launched a procedure in order to impose the respect of the rule of law in the country.

Reporters Without Borders in its 2019 assessment of Poland stated that the public media &quot;have been transformed into government propaganda mouthpieces.&quot; Poland is rated &quot;Partly Free&quot; in Freedom House&#x27;s 2017 &quot;Freedom of the Press&quot; report. It is ranked 62 out of 180 countries in the 2020 World Press Freedom index by Reporters Without Borders, down from 18th in 2015.

===Public television and radio broadcasters===

After winning parliamentary elections in October 2015, the PiS party replaced the management positions at the public television and radio broadcasters. This effort was not limited to public broadcasters since the party leadership tried to control also private media outlets for instance by advancing a proposal to restrict reporters’ access to the parliament.

In December 2015 the so-called &quot;small media law&quot; prepared by PiS was sent to the Polish parliament. The proposal, which was conceived as a temporary measure before the adoption of a more comprehensive media law, provided for the termination of the mandates of the current members of the national television and radio broadcasters’ management and supervisory boards and their replacement through the direct appointment by the treasury minister. The law created great turmoil in public media: the directors of several public channels left their position in protest. Public protests occurred across Poland as well as abroad in the environment connected the community of Poles living abroad.

The staffing changes were not limited to the managing positions. According to the Association of Journalists, 225 journalists left the public media during 2016, due to either layoffs or resignations. The new law and its effects were widely criticized also abroad: the European Federation of Journalists, the European Broadcasting Union, the Association of European Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists and Index on Censorship denounced this decision. In January 2016, the European Commission discussed the &quot;small media law&quot; in the frame of its assessment of the situation in Poland under the Rule of Law Framework.

In December 2016, the Constitutional Tribunal declared parts of the &quot;small media law&quot; unconstitutional, calling for the need to constitutional rules on the KRRiT which should have played a decisive role in appointing its management and supervisory boards.

In the first months of 2016 the PiS&#x27;s government worked on a &quot;big media law&quot;, a more comprehensive reform of the media system. In April 2016, a draft Law on National Media was presented to the Parliament. The draft wanted to transform the public radio and television broadcasters into &quot;national media&quot;, thus shifting away from the model of editorially independent public service. The bill obliged the public media to disseminate the views of the prime minister, the president, and the speakers of the parliament and stated that the public media should preserve national traditions, patriotic and Christian values and strengthen the national community. The Council of Europe criticized the draft, describing it a move towards a &quot;State broadcasters&quot;. The law was not adopted: the government decided to pursue a less ambitious approach and proposed the Parliament a &quot;bridge law&quot; to go into force at the expiration of the &quot;small media law&quot;. The &quot;bridge law&quot; was approved in June 2016: the law stated that a newly established National Media Council have to be responsible for the appointment of the management and supervisory boards of the public media. The arrangement established by the law effectively guarantees the rule party a key role in appointing the members of the national Media Council. The law also does not forbid the new council&#x27;s members from belonging to political party.

<doc id="23033" wikidata="Q45" url="?curid=23033" title="Portugal">
<text>Portugal, officially the Portuguese Republic, is a country in the Iberian Peninsula in Southwestern Europe. Featuring the westernmost point in continental Europe, Portugal borders Spain to its north and east, with which it shares the longest uninterrupted border in the European Union; to the south and the west is the North Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and southwest lie the Macaronesian archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, which are the two autonomous regions of Portugal. Lisbon is the capital and largest city, followed by Porto, which is the only other metropolitan area.

The western part of the Iberian Peninsula has been continuously inhabited since prehistoric times, with the earliest signs of settlement dating to 5500 BC. Celtic and Iberian peoples arrived in the first millennium BC. The region came under Roman control in the second century BC, followed by a succession of Germanic peoples and the Alans from the fifth to eighth centuries AD. Muslims conquered the mainland of present-day Portugal in the eighth century, and Islamic rule was expelled by the Christian &quot;Reconquista&quot; culminating with the final capture of Faro, between 1238 and 1249 AD. Modern Portugal began taking shape during this period, initially as a county of the Christian Kingdom of León in 868 and subsequently as a sovereign Kingdom with the Treaty of Zamora in 1143.

As one of the earliest participants in the Age of Discovery, the Kingdom of Portugal settled Madeira and the Azores, and established itself as a major economic and political power, largely through a maritime empire that extended mostly along the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean coasts. The Portuguese were among the first Europeans to explore and discover new territories and sea routes in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and southern and eastern Asia, establishing a global commercial network of settlements, colonies, and trading posts. Lucrative trade in spices, slaves, and various other commodities enriched the kingdom and fueled a cultural renaissance, but could not stem growing internal political challenges. A dynastic crisis in the early 1580s resulted in the Iberian Union (1580–1640), which unified Portugal under Spanish rule, marking its gradual decline as a global power. Portuguese sovereignty was regained in 1688 following a costly and protracted war, while the 1755 Lisbon earthquake destroyed the city and further damaged the empire&#x27;s economy.

The Napoleonic Wars drove the Portuguese royal family to relocate to Brazil in 1807 and elevate it from colony to kingdom; this action ultimately culminated in Brazilian independence in 1822, which in turn triggered a civil war (1828–1834) between liberal constitutionalists and absolutist monarchists. The monarchy endured until the 5 October 1910 revolution, which replaced it with the Portuguese First Republic. A phase of unrest ultimately led to the rise of authoritarian regimes of the Ditadura Nacional and the Estado Novo. Democracy was finally restored following the Carnation Revolution of 1974, which brought an end to the Portuguese Colonial War and allowed the last of Portugal&#x27;s African territories to achieve independence.

Portugal&#x27;s imperial history has left a vast cultural legacy, with around 300 million Portuguese speakers around the world. Today, it is a developed country with an advanced economy relying chiefly upon services, industry, and tourism. Portugal, a member of the United Nations, the European Union, the Schengen Area, and the Council of Europe, was one of the founding members of NATO, the eurozone, the OECD, and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Portugal&quot; derives from the combined Roman-Celtic place name Portus Cale (present-day&#x27;s conurbation of Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia). Porto stems from the Latin for port, ; &quot;Cale&quot;″s meaning and origin is unclear. The mainstream explanation is an ethnonym derived from the Callaeci, also known as the Gallaeci peoples, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula. One theory proposes &quot;Cale&quot; is a derivation of the Celtic word for &#x27;port&#x27;. Another is that &quot;Cala&quot; was a Celtic goddess. Some French scholars believe it may have come from , the port of the Gauls.

Around 200 BC, the Romans took Iberia from the Carthaginians during the Second Punic War. In the process they conquered Cale, renaming it (&#x27;Port of Cale&#x27;) and incorporating it into the province of Gallaecia. During the Middle Ages, the region around Portus Cale became known by the Suebi and Visigoths as &quot;Portucale&quot;. The name &quot;Portucale&quot; changed into &quot;Portugale&quot; during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, it was used to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and Minho. By the 11th and 12th centuries, &quot;Portugale&quot;, &quot;Portugallia&quot;, &quot;Portvgallo&quot; or &quot;Portvgalliae&quot; was already referred to as &quot;Portugal&quot;.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===

The region has been inhabited by humans since circa 400,000 years ago, when Homo heidelbergensis entered the area. The oldest human fossil found in Portugal is the 400,000-year-old &quot;Aroeira 3&quot; &quot;H. Heidelbergensis&quot; skull discovered in the Cave of Aroeira in 2014. Later Neanderthals roamed the northern Iberian peninsula and a tooth has been found at Nova da Columbeira cave in Estremadura. Homo sapiens sapiens arrived in Portugal around 35,000 years ago and spread rapidly. Pre-Celtic tribes inhabited Portugal. The Cynetes developed a written language, leaving stelae, which are mainly found in the south.

Early in the first millennium BC, several waves of Celts invaded Portugal from Central Europe and intermarried with the local populations to form several different ethnic groups. The Celtic presence is patent in archaeological and linguistic evidence. They dominated most of northern and central Portugal, while the south maintained its older character (believed non-Indo-European, likely related to Basque) until the Roman conquest. In southern Portugal, some small, semi-permanent commercial coastal settlements were also founded by Phoenicians and Carthaginians.

=== Roman Portugal ===

Romans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome&#x27;s opponent in the Punic Wars, were expelled from their coastal colonies. During Julius Caesar&#x27;s rule, almost the entire peninsula was annexed to Rome. The conquest took two hundred years and many died, including those sentenced to work in slave mines or sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. Roman occupation suffered a setback in 155 BC, when a rebellion began in the north. The Lusitanians and other native tribes, under the leadership of Viriathus, wrested control of all of western Iberia. Rome sent legions to quell the rebellion but were unsuccessful. Roman leaders bribed Viriathus&#x27;s allies to kill him in 139 BC; he was replaced by Tautalus.

In 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of Roman province. Later, a northern province was separated from the province of Tarraconensis, under Emperor Diocletian&#x27;s reforms, known as Gallaecia. There are still ruins of castros (hill forts) and remains of the Castro culture, like Conímbriga, Mirobriga and Briteiros.

=== Germanic kingdoms ===
In 409, with the decline of the Roman Empire, the Iberian Peninsula was occupied by Germanic tribes. In 411, with a federation contract with Emperor Honorius, many of these people settled in Hispania. An important group was made up of the Suebi and Vandals in Gallaecia, who founded a Suebi Kingdom with its capital in Braga. They came to dominate Aeminium (Coimbra) as well, and there were Visigoths to the south.
The Suebi and the Visigoths were the Germanic tribes who had the most lasting presence in the territories corresponding to modern Portugal. As elsewhere in Western Europe, there was a sharp decline in urban life during the Dark Ages.

Roman institutions disappeared in the wake of the Germanic invasions with the exception of ecclesiastical organisations, which were fostered by the Suebi in the fifth century and adopted by the Visigoths afterwards. Although the Suebi and Visigoths were initially followers of Arianism and Priscillianism, they adopted Catholicism from the local inhabitants. St. Martin of Braga was a particularly influential evangelist.

In 429, the Visigoths moved south to expel the Alans and Vandals and founded a kingdom with its capital in Toledo. From 470, conflict between the Suebi and Visigoths increased. In 585, the Visigothic King Liuvigild conquered Braga and annexed Gallaecia; the Iberian Peninsula was unified under a Visigothic Kingdom. A new class emerged, unknown in Roman times: a nobility, which played a key social and political role during the Middle Ages. It was under the Visigoths that the Church began to play an important part within the state. As the Visigoths did not learn Latin from the local people, they had to rely on bishops to continue the Roman system of governance. The laws were made by councils of bishops, and the clergy emerged as a high-ranking class.

=== Islamic period ===
Today&#x27;s continental Portugal, along with most of modern Spain, was invaded from the South and became part of al-Andalus between 726 and 1249, following the Umayyad Caliphate conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. This rule lasted decades in the North, up to five centuries in the South.

After defeating the Visigoths in a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate&#x27;s empire of Damascus, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under Abd-ar-Rahman I with the establishment of the Emirate of Córdoba. The Emirate became the Caliphate of Córdoba in 929, until its dissolution in 1031, into 23 small kingdoms, called Taifa kingdoms.

The governors of the taifas proclaimed themselves Emir of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north. Most of present-day Portugal fell into the hands of the Taifa of Badajoz of the Aftasid Dynasty, and in 1022 the Taifa of Seville of the Abbadids poets. The Taifa period ended with the conquest of the Almoravids in 1086, then by the Almohads in 1147.
Al-Andaluz was divided into districts called &quot;Kura&quot;. Gharb Al-Andalus at its largest consisted of ten kuras, each with a distinct capital and governor. The main cities were in the southern half of the country: Beja, Silves, Alcácer do Sal, Santarém and Lisbon. The Muslim population consisted mainly of native Iberian converts to Islam and Berbers. The Arabs (mainly noblemen from Syria) although a minority, constituted the elite. The Berbers who joined them, were nomads from the Rif Mountains of North Africa.

Invasions from the North also occurred in this period, with Viking incursions raiding the coast between the 9th and 11th centuries, including Lisbon. This resulted in the establishment of small Norse settlements in the coastline between Douro and Minho.

=== Reconquista ===
The Reconquista was a period when Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from Moorish domination. An Asturian Visigothic noble named Pelagius of Asturias was elected leader in 718 by many of the ousted Visigoth nobles. Pelagius called for the remnants of the Christian Visigothic armies to rebel against the Moors and regroup in the unconquered northern Asturian highlands, known today as the Cantabrian Mountains, in north-west Spain. After defeating the Moors in the Battle of Covadonga in 722, Pelagius was proclaimed king, thus founding the Christian Kingdom of Asturias and starting the war of Christian reconquest.

At the end of the 9th century, the region of Portugal between the rivers Minho and Douro, was reconquered from the Moors by nobleman and knight Vímara Peres on the orders of King Alfonso III of Asturias. Finding many towns deserted, he decided to repopulate and rebuild them.

Vímara Peres elevated the region to the status of County, naming it the County of Portugal after its major port city – &quot;Portus Cale&quot; or modern Porto. One of the first cities he founded is Vimaranes, known today as Guimarães – &quot;birthplace of the Portuguese nation&quot; or the &quot;cradle city&quot;.

After annexing the County of Portugal into one of the counties that made up the Kingdom of Asturias, King Alfonso III of Asturias knighted Vímara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as &quot;Portucale&quot;, &quot;Portugale&quot;, and simultaneously &quot;Portugália&quot;. With the forced abdication of Alfonso III in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms; they were reunited in 924 under the crown of León.

In 1093 Alfonso VI of León bestowed the county to Henry of Burgundy and married him to his daughter, Teresa of León. Henry thus became Henry, Count of Portugal and based his newly formed county from Bracara Augusta (modern Braga).

=== Independence ===
At the Battle of São Mamede, in the outskirts of Guimarães, in 1128, Afonso Henriques, Count of Portugal, defeated his mother Countess Teresa and her lover Fernão Peres de Trava, establishing himself as sole leader of the county. Afonso continued his father Henry of Burgundy&#x27;s Reconquista wars. His campaigns were successful and in 1139, he obtained a victory in the Battle of Ourique, so was proclaimed King of Portugal by his soldiers. This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal became the independent Kingdom of Portugal and, in 1129, the capital city was transferred from Guimarães to Coimbra. Afonso was recognized as the first king of Portugal in 1143 by King Alfonso VII of León, and in 1179 by Pope Alexander III as Afonso I of Portugal.
Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military monastic orders, continued pushing southwards against the Moors. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the Algarve and expulsion of the last Moorish settlements. With minor readjustments, Portugal&#x27;s territorial borders have remained the same, making it one of the oldest established nations in Europe.

After a conflict with the kingdom of Castile, Denis of Portugal signed the Treaty of Alcañices in 1297 with Ferdinand IV of Castile. This treaty established the border between the kingdoms of Portugal and Leon. The reigns of Denis, Afonso IV, and Peter I mostly saw peace with the other kingdoms of Iberia.

In 1348-49 Portugal, as with the rest of Europe, was devastated by the Black Death. In 1373, Portugal made an alliance with England, the oldest standing alliance in the world.

=== Age of Discoveries ===
In 1383 John I of Castile, Beatrice of Portugal, and Ferdinand I of Portugal claimed the throne of Portugal. John of Aviz, later John I of Portugal, defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota, and the House of Aviz became the ruling house. The new ruling dynasty led Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture. They created and sponsored literature, such as a history of Portugal, by Fernão Lopes.

Portugal spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery under the sponsorship of Prince Henry the Navigator. Portugal explored the Atlantic, encountering the Azores, Madeira, and Portuguese Cape Verde, which led to the first colonisation movements. The Portuguese explored the Indian Ocean, established trade routes in most of southern Asia, and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China (Jorge Álvares) and Japan (Nanban trade). In 1415, Portugal acquired its first colonies by conquering Ceuta, in North Africa. Throughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for commodities, ranging from gold to slavery. Portugal sailed the Portuguese India Armadas to Goa via the Cape of Good Hope.

The Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494 was intended to resolve a dispute created following the return of Christopher Columbus and divided the newly located lands outside Europe between Portugal and Spain along a line west of the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of Africa. In 1498 Vasco da Gama became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic prosperity to Portugal and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip&#x27;s, one of many Portuguese colonies of the Americas.

In 1500, Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia, landing in Taiwan, Japan, Timor, Flores, and the Moluccas. Although it was believed the Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is evidence the Portuguese may have discovered it in 1521.

Between 1519 and 1522 Ferdinand Magellan organised a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe. The Treaty of Zaragoza, signed in 1529 between Portugal and Spain, divided the Pacific Ocean between Spain and Portugal.

=== Iberian Union and Restoration ===
Portugal voluntarily entered a dynastic union (1580–1640) because the last two kings of the House of Aviz died without heirs, resulting in the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580. Philip II of Spain claimed the throne and was accepted as Philip I of Portugal. Portugal did not lose its formal independence, forming a union of kingdoms. But the joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of an independent foreign policy, and led to its involvement in the Eighty Years&#x27; War between Spain and the Netherlands.
War led to a deterioration of relations with Portugal&#x27;s oldest ally, England, and the loss of Hormuz, a strategic trading post located between Iran and Oman. From 1595 to 1663 the Dutch Portuguese War primarily involved Dutch companies invading Portuguese colonies and commercial interests in Brazil, Africa, India and the Far East, resulting in the loss of Portugal&#x27;s Indian sea trade monopoly.

In 1640 John IV of Portugal spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. The Portuguese Restoration War ended the 60-year period of the Iberian Union under the House of Habsburg. This was the beginning of the House of Braganza, which reigned until 1910. John V saw a reign characterized by the influx of gold into the royal treasury, supplied largely by the royal fifth (tax on precious metals) from the Portuguese colonies of Brazil and Maranhão. Most estimates place the number of Portuguese migrants to Colonial Brazil during the gold rush of the 18th century at 600,000. This represented one of the largest movements of European populations to their colonies, during colonial times.

=== Pombaline era and Enlightenment ===
In 1738 Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, later ennobled as 1st Marquis of Pombal, began a career as the Portuguese Ambassador in London, later in Vienna. King Joseph I was crowned in 1750 and made him his Minister of Foreign Affairs. As the King&#x27;s confidence in Carvalho e Melo increased, he entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Carvalho e Melo was made prime minister. Impressed by British economic success witnessed as Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal.

In 1761, during the reign of King José I, he banned the import of black slaves into mainland Portugal and India, not for humanitarian reasons, but because they were a necessary work force in Brazil. At the same time, he encouraged the trade of black slaves (&quot;the pieces&quot;, in the terms of that time) to that colony, and with the support and direct involvement of the Marquis of Pombal, two companies were founded - the &quot;Companhia do Grão-Pará e Maranhão&quot; and the &quot;Companhia Geral de Pernambuco e Paraíba&quot; - whose main activity was the trafficking of slaves, mostly Africans, to Brazilian lands.

He reorganised the army and navy and ended legal discrimination against different Christian sects. He created companies and guilds to regulate commercial activity and one of the first appellation systems by demarcating the region for production of Port to ensure the wine&#x27;s quality. This was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He imposed strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society, along with a widespread review of the tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes.

Lisbon was struck by a major earthquake on November 1st 1755, magnitude estimated to have been between 7.7 and 9.0, with casualties ranging from 12,000 to 50,000. Following the earthquake, Joseph I gave his prime minister more power, and Carvalho de Melo became an enlightened despot. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The Marquis of Távora, several members of his family and even servants were tortured and executed in public with extreme brutality (even by the standards of the time), as alleged part of the Távora affair.

The following year, the Jesuits were suppressed and expelled. This crushed opposition by publicly demonstrating even the aristocracy was powerless before Pombal. Further titled &quot;Marquês de Pombal&quot; in 1770, he ruled Portugal until Joseph I&#x27;s death in 1777. The new ruler, Queen Maria I of Portugal, disliked Pombal because of his excesses, and upon her accession to the throne, withdrew all his political offices. Pombal was banished to his estate at Pombal, where he died in 1782.

Historians argue that Pombal&#x27;s &quot;enlightenment,&quot; while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial exploitation and consolidating personal control, and profit.

=== Crises of the 19th century ===

In 1807 Portugal refused Napoleon&#x27;s demand to accede to the Continental System of embargo against the United Kingdom; a French invasion under General Junot followed, and Lisbon was captured in 1807. British intervention in the Peninsular War helped maintain Portuguese independence; the last French troops were expelled in 1812.

Rio de Janeiro in Brazil was the Portuguese capital between 1808 and 1821. In 1820, constitutionalist insurrections took place at Porto and Lisbon. Lisbon regained its status as the capital of Portugal when Brazil declared its independence in 1822. The death of King John VI in 1826 led to a crisis of royal succession. His eldest son, Pedro I of Brazil, briefly became Pedro IV of Portugal, but neither the Portuguese nor Brazilians wanted a unified monarchy; consequently, Pedro abdicated the Portuguese crown in favor of his 7-year-old daughter, Maria da Glória, on the condition that when she came of age she would marry his brother, Miguel. Dissatisfaction at Pedro&#x27;s constitutional reforms led the &quot;absolutist&quot; faction of landowners and the church to proclaim Miguel king in February 1828. This led to the Liberal Wars, also known as the &quot;War of the Two Brothers&quot; or the &quot;Portuguese Civil War&quot;, in which Pedro forced Miguel to abdicate and go into exile in 1834 and place his daughter on the throne as Queen Maria II of Portugal.

After 1815 the Portuguese expanded their trading ports along the African coast, moving inland to take control of Angola and Mozambique. The slave trade was abolished in 1836. In Portuguese India, trade flourished in the colony of Goa, with its subsidiary colonies of Macau, near Hong Kong, and Timor, north of Australia. The Portuguese successfully introduced Catholicism and the Portuguese language into their colonies, while most settlers continued to head to Brazil.

On 11 January 1890, the British government delivered an ultimatum to Portugal, demanding the withdrawal of Portuguese forces from the area between Portugal&#x27;s colonies of Mozambique and Angola. The area had been claimed by Portugal as part of its colonialist Pink Map project, but Britain disputed these claims, mostly due to Cecil Rhodes&#x27; aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway, which was intended to link all British colonies via a single railway. The government of Portugal quietly accepted the ultimatum and withdrew their forces from the disputed area, leading to a widespread backlash among the Portuguese public, who viewed acceptance of the British demands as a humiliation.

=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===
On 5 October 1910, a coup d&#x27;état overthrew the near 800-year-old Monarchy and the Republic was proclaimed. During World War I, Portugal helped the Allies fight the Central Powers; however the war hurt its weak economy. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the First Portuguese Republic. These conditions led to the failed Monarchy of the North, 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état, and creation of the National Dictatorship (&quot;Ditadura Nacional&quot;). This in turn led to the right-wing dictatorship of the Estado Novo (New State), under António de Oliveira Salazar in 1933.

Portugal remained neutral in World War II. From the 1940s to 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of NATO, OECD, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and joined the United Nations in 1955. New economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with Angola and Mozambique being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal&#x27;s status as a transcontinental nation and not a colonial empire.

Pro-Indian residents of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, separated those territories from Portuguese rule in 1954. In 1961, Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá&#x27;s annexation by the Republic of Dahomey was the start of a process that led to the dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire. Another forcible retreat occurred in 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish Goa. The Portuguese were involved in armed conflict in Portuguese India against the Indian Armed Forces. The operations resulted in the defeat and loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the Indian subcontinent. The Portuguese regime refused to recognise Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in the National Assembly until the coup of 1974.

Also in the early 1960s the independence movements in the Portuguese provinces of Portuguese Angola, Portuguese Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea in Africa, resulted in the Portuguese Colonial War (lasting from 1961 till 1974). The war mobilised around 1.4 million men for military or for civilian support service, and led to large casualties. Throughout the colonial war period Portugal dealt with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by the international community. The authoritarian and conservative Estado Novo regime, first governed by Salazar and from 1968 by Marcelo Caetano, tried to preserve the empire.

=== Carnation Revolution and return to democracy===
The government and army resisted the decolonization of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a left-wing military coup in Lisbon, the Carnation Revolution, led the way for the independence of territories, as well as the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (&quot;Processo Revolucionário Em Curso&quot;). This period was characterised by power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. By the summer of 1975, the tensions were so high, that the country was on the verge of civil war. Forces connected to the extreme left-wing launched another coup on 25 November, but a military faction, the Group of Nine, initiated a counter-coup.

The Group of Nine emerged victorious, preventing the establishment of a communist state and ending political instability. The retreat from the overseas territories prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from its African territories. Over one million Portuguese refugees fled the former Portuguese provinces, as white settlers were usually not considered part of the former colonies. By 1975, all Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held its first democratic elections in 50 years.

Portugal continued to be governed by a National Salvation Junta until the Portuguese legislative election of 1976. It was won by the Portuguese Socialist Party and Mário Soares, its leader, became prime minister. Soares would be prime minister from 1976 to 1978 and 1983 to 1985. Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution. He initiated the process of accession to the European Economic Community (EEC).

After the transition to democracy, Portugal flipped between socialism and adherence to the neoliberal model. Land reform and nationalisations were enforced; the Portuguese Constitution was rewritten to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution had references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a socialist economy. Portugal&#x27;s economic situation after the revolution obliged the government to pursue International Monetary Fund (IMF)-monitored stabilisation programmes in 1977–78 and 1983–85. In 1986 Portugal alongside Spain, joined the European Economic Community which later became the European Union (EU). Portugal&#x27;s economy progressed considerably as a result of European Structural and Investment Funds and companies&#x27; easier access to foreign markets.

Portugal&#x27;s last overseas territory, Macau, was peacefully handed over to China in 1999. In 2002, the independence of East Timor (Asia) was formally recognised by Portugal. In 1995, Portugal started to implement Schengen Area rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members. Expo &#x27;98 took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the euro and eurozone. In 2004 José Manuel Barroso, the then Prime Minister of Portugal, was nominated President of the European Commission. On 1 December 2009 the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union. Economic disruption and an unsustainable growth in government debt during the financial crisis of 2007–2008 led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the European Financial Stability Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility, a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.

== Geography ==


Portugal occupies an area on the Iberian Peninsula (referred to as &quot;the continent&quot; by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: Madeira and the Azores. It lies between latitudes 30° and 42° N, and longitudes 32° and 6° W.

Continental Portugal is split by its main river, the Tagus, that flows from Spain and disgorges in the Tagus Estuary at Lisbon, before escaping into the Atlantic. The northern landscape is mountainous towards the interior with several plateaus indented by river valleys, whereas the south, including the Algarve and the Alentejo regions, is characterized by rolling plains.

Portugal&#x27;s highest peak is Mount Pico on Pico Island in the Azores. The archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores are scattered within the Atlantic Ocean: the Azores straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on a tectonic triple junction, and Madeira along a range formed by in-plate hotspot geology. Geologically, these islands were formed by volcanic and seismic events. The last terrestrial volcanic eruption occurred in 1957–58 (Capelinhos) and minor earthquakes occur sporadically.

The exclusive economic zone, a sea zone over which the Portuguese have special rights in exploration and have use of marine resources, covers an area of . This is the 3rd largest exclusive economic zone of the European Union and the 20th largest in the world.

=== Provinces of Portugal ===
The term &quot;provinces&quot; () has been used throughout history to identify regions of continental Portugal. Current legal subdivisions of Portugal do not coincide with the provinces, but several provinces, in their 19th- and 20th-century versions, still correspond to culturally relevant, strongly self-identifying categories. They include:
*Alentejo (Alto Alentejo, Baixo Alentejo)
*Algarve
*Beira (Beira Alta, Beira Baixa, Beira Litoral)
*Douro Litoral
*Estremadura
*Minho
*Ribatejo
*Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro
The islands of Azores and Madeira were never called &quot;provinces&quot;.

=== Climate ===

Portugal is mainly characterised by a Mediterranean climate, temperate maritime climate in high altitude zones of the Azorean islands; a semi-arid climate in parts of the Beja District far south and in Porto Santo Island, a hot desert climate in the Selvagens Islands and a humid subtropical climate in the western Azores, according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification. It is one of the warmest countries in Europe: the average temperature in mainland Portugal varies from in the mountainous interior north to in the south and on the Guadiana river basin. There are variations from the highlands to the lowlands. The Algarve, separated from the Alentejo region by mountains reaching up to in Alto da Fóia, has a climate similar to that of the southern coastal areas of Spain or Southwest Australia.

Annual average rainfall in the mainland varies from just over on the Peneda-Gerês National Park to less than in southern parts of Alentejo. Mount Pico receives the largest annual rainfall (over per year), according to &quot;Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera&quot;. In some areas, such as the Guadiana basin, annual diurnal average temperatures can be as high as , and summer&#x27;s highest temperatures are routinely over . The record high of was recorded in Amareleja.

Snowfalls occur regularly, in the winter, in the interior North and Centre, particularly on the mountains. In winter, temperatures may drop below . In these places snow can fall any time from October to May. In the South snowfalls are rare but still occur in the highest elevations. While the official absolute minimum by IPMA is in Penhas da Saúde and Miranda do Douro, lower temperatures have been recorded. Continental Portugal receives around 2,300-3,200 hours of sunshine annually, an average of 4–6 hours in winter and 10–12 hours in the summer, with higher values in the south-east, south-west, Algarve coast and lower in the north-west.

Portugal&#x27;s central west and southwest coasts have an extreme ocean seasonal lag; sea temperatures are warmer in October than in July and are their coldest in March. The average sea surface temperature on the west coast of mainland Portugal varies from in January−March to in August−October while on the south coast it ranges from in January−March and rises in the summer to about , occasionally reaching . In the Azores, around in February−April to in July−September, and in Madeira, around in February−April to in August−October.

Azores and Madeira have a subtropical climate, although variations between islands exist. The Madeira and Azorean archipelagos have a narrower temperature range, with annual average temperatures exceeding in some parts of the coast. Some islands in Azores have drier months in the summer. Consequently, the islands of the Azores have been identified as having a Mediterranean climate, while some islands (such as Flores or Corvo) are classified as Humid subtropical, transitioning into an Oceanic climate at higher altitudes. Porto Santo Island in Madeira has a warm semi-arid climate. The Savage Islands, which are part of the regional territory of Madeira and a nature reserve are unique in being classified as a desert climate with an annual average rainfall of approximately .

=== Biodiversity===

Portugal is located on the Mediterranean Basin, the third most diverse hotspot of flora in the world. It is home to six terrestrial ecoregions: Azores temperate mixed forests, Cantabrian mixed forests, Madeira evergreen forests, Iberian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests, Northwest Iberian montane forests, and Southwest Iberian Mediterranean sclerophyllous and mixed forests. Over 22% of its land area is included in the Natura 2000 network. Eucalyptus, cork oak and maritime pine together make up 71% of the total forested area of continental Portugal. Wildfires are quite common and a major issue in Portugal, being the country with the highest percentage of burned area, on average, in the entire European Union.

Geographical and climatic conditions facilitate the introduction of exotic species that later turn to be invasive and destructive to the native habitats. Around 20 percent of the total number of extant species in continental Portugal are exotic. Portugal is the second country in Europe with the highest number of threatened animal and plant species. Portugal as a whole is an important stopover for migratory bird species.

The large mammalian species of Portugal (deer, Iberian ibex, wild boar, red fox, Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx) were once widespread throughout the country, but intense hunting, habitat degradation and growing pressure from agriculture and livestock reduced population on a large scale in the 19th and early 20th century, others, such as the Portuguese ibex were even led to extinction. Today, these animals are re-expanding their native range.

The Portuguese west coast is part of the four major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems of the ocean. This seasonal upwelling system typically seen during the summer months brings cooler, nutrient rich water up to the sea surface promoting phytoplankton growth, zooplankton development and the subsequent rich diversity in pelagic fish and other marine invertebrates. This makes Portugal one of the largest per capita fish-consumers in the world. 73% of the freshwater fish occurring in the Iberian Peninsula are endemic, the largest out of any region in Europe. Some protected areas of Portugal include: the Serras de Aire e Candeeiros, the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park, and the Montesinho Natural Park which hosts some of the only populations of Iberian wolf and Iberian brown bear.

== Politics ==
Portugal has been a semi-presidential representative democratic republic since the ratification of the Constitution of 1976, with Lisbon, the nation&#x27;s largest city, as its capital. The Constitution grants the division or separation of powers among four sovereignty bodies: the President of the Republic, the Assembly of the Republic, the Government and the Courts.

The Head of State is the President of the Republic, elected to a five-year term by direct, universal suffrage; the current president is Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. Although largely a ceremonial post, Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and other members of the Government; dismissing the Prime Minister; dissolving the Assembly; vetoing legislation (which may be overridden by the Assembly); and declaring war (only on the advice of the Government and with the authorisation of the Assembly). The President has also supervisory and reserve powers and is the &quot;ex officio&quot; Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The President is advised on issues of importance by the Council of State.

===Government===
The Assembly of the Republic is a single chamber parliament composed of a maximum of 230 deputies elected for a four-year term. The Government is headed by the Prime Minister and includes Ministers and Secretaries of State, that have full executive powers; the current prime minister is Luís Montenegro. The Council of Ministers – under the Prime Minister (or the President at the latter&#x27;s request) and the Ministers – acts as the cabinet. The Courts are organized into several levels, among the judicial, administrative and fiscal branches. The Supreme Courts are institutions of last resort/appeal. A thirteen-member Constitutional Court oversees the constitutionality of the laws.

Portugal operates a multi-party system of competitive legislatures/local administrative governments at the national, regional and local levels. The Assembly of the Republic, Regional Assemblies and local municipalities and parishes, are dominated by two political parties, the Social Democratic Party and the Socialist Party, in addition to Enough, the Liberal Initiative, the Left Bloc, the Unitary Democratic Coalition (Portuguese Communist Party and Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot;), LIVRE, the CDS – People&#x27;s Party and the People Animals Nature.

=== Foreign relations ===

A member state of the United Nations since 1955, Portugal is a founding member of NATO (1949), the OECD (1961) and EFTA (1960); it left the last in 1986 to join the European Economic Community, which became the European Union in 1993. In 1996, Portugal co-founded the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth, an international organisation and political association of Lusophone nations where Portuguese is an official language. Portugal has hosted several international summits and events like the first EU–Brazil summit in July 2007, the second EU–African Union summit in December 2007, the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon also in December 2007, and the NATO summit in November 2010.

Portugal was a full member of the Latin Union (1983) and the Organisation of Ibero-American States (1949). It has a friendship alliance and dual citizenship treaty with its former colony, Brazil. Portugal and the United Kingdom share the world&#x27;s oldest active military accord through their Anglo-Portuguese Alliance (Treaty of Windsor), signed in 1373.

=== Territorial disputes ===
Olivenza: Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297, the municipality of Olivença was ceded to Spain under the Treaty of Badajoz in 1801, after the War of the Oranges. Portugal claimed it back in 1815 under the Treaty of Vienna. However, since the 19th century, it has been continuously ruled by Spain which considers the territory theirs not only &quot;de facto&quot; but also &quot;de jure&quot;.

Savage Islands: A small group of mostly uninhabited islets which fall under Portuguese Madeira&#x27;s regional autonomous jurisdiction. Found in 1364 by Italian mariners under the service of Prince Henry The Navigator, it was first noted by Portuguese navigator Diogo Gomes de Sintra in 1438. Historically, the islands have belonged to private Portuguese owners from the 16th century on, until 1971 when the government purchased them and established a natural reserve area covering the whole archipelago. The islands have been claimed by Spain since 1911, and the dispute has caused some periods of political tension between the two countries. The main problem for Spain&#x27;s attempts to claim these small islands, has been not so much their intrinsic value, but the fact that they expand Portugal&#x27;s exclusive economic zone considerably to the south, in detriment of Spain. The Selvagens Islands have been tentatively added to UNESCO&#x27;s world heritage list in 2017.

=== Military ===
The armed forces have three branches: Navy, Army and Air Force, commanded by the Portuguese Armed Forces General Staff. They serve primarily as a self-defence force whose mission is to protect the territorial integrity of the country but can also be used in offensive missions in foreign territories. In recent years, the Portuguese Armed Forces have carried out several NATO and European Union military missions in various territories, namely in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Mali, Central African Republic, Somalia, Mozambique and East Timor. As of 2023, the three branches numbered 24.000 military personnel. Portuguese military expenditure in 2023 was more than 4 billion US$, representing 1.48 per cent of GDP.

The Army of 11,000 personnel comprises three brigades and other small units. An Infantry Brigade (mainly equipped with Pandur II APC, M114 howitzer and MIM-72 Chaparral air defence systems), a Mechanized Brigade (mainly equipped with Leopard 2 A6 tanks and M113A2 APC) and a Rapid Reaction Brigade (consisting of Paratroopers, Commandos, Rangers and Artillery Regiment). The Navy (7,000 personnel, of which 900 are marines), the world&#x27;s oldest surviving naval force, has five frigates, two corvettes, two submarines, and 20 oceanic patrol vessels. The Air Force (6,000 personnel) has the Lockheed F-16M Fighting Falcon as the main combat aircraft.

In addition to the three branches of the armed forces, there is the National Republican Guard, a security force subject to military law and organisation (gendarmerie) comprising 25,000 personnel. This force is under the authority of both the Defence and the Interior Ministry. It has provided detachments for participation in international operations in Iraq and East Timor. The United States maintains a military presence with 770 troops in the Lajes Air Base at Terceira Island, in the Azores. The Allied Joint Force Command Lisbon (JFC Lisbon) is one of the three main subdivisions of NATO&#x27;s Allied Command Operations.

=== Law and justice ===

The Portuguese legal system is part of the civil law legal system. The main laws include the Constitution (1976), the Portuguese Civil Code (1966) and the Penal Code of Portugal (1982), as amended. Other relevant laws are the &quot;Commercial Code&quot; (1888) and the &quot;Civil Procedure Code&quot; (1961). Portuguese laws were applied in the former colonies and territories and continue to be influences for those countries. The supreme national courts are the Supreme Court of Justice and the Constitutional Court. The Public Ministry, headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.

Drug decriminalisation was declared in 2001, making Portugal the first country to allow usage and personal possession of all common drugs. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal&#x27;s drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with HIV infection cases, which dropped 50 percent by 2009. Overall drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds declined, however use of marijuana rose slightly.

LGBT rights in Portugal have increased substantially in the 21st century. In 2003, Portugal added an anti-discrimination employment law on the basis of sexual orientation. In 2004, sexual orientation was added to the Constitution as part of the protected from discrimination characteristics. In 2010, Portugal became the sixth country in Europe and eighth in the world to legalize same-sex marriage at the national level.

LGBT adoption has been allowed since 2016 as has female same-sex couple access to medically assisted reproduction. In 2017 the &quot;Law of Gender Identity&quot;, simplified the legal process of gender and name change for transgender people, making it easier for minors to change their sex marker in legal documents. In 2018, the right to gender identity and gender expression self-determination became protected, intersex minors became protected by law from unnecessary medical procedures &quot;until the minor gender identity manifests&quot; and the right of protection from discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics became protected by the same law.

Euthanasia has been legalised after several parliamentary reviews. National residents over 18 who are terminally ill and in extreme suffering, but who can still decide to, have the legal right to request for assisted dying. Non-residents or foreigners are not allowed euthanasia. Despite the Parliamentary approval in 2023, Euthanasia legislation is yet to be defined and implemented.

=== Law enforcement ===
Portugal&#x27;s main police organisations are the &quot;Guarda Nacional Republicana – GNR&quot; (National Republican Guard), a gendarmerie; the &quot;Polícia de Segurança Pública – PSP&quot; (Public Security Police), a civilian police force who work in urban areas; and the &quot;Polícia Judiciária – PJ&quot; (Judicial Police), a highly specialised criminal investigation police that is overseen by the Public Ministry.

Portugal has 49 correctional facilities in total run by the Ministry of Justice. They include seventeen central prisons, four special prisons, twenty-seven regional prisons, and one &#x27;Cadeia de Apoio&#x27; (Support Detention Centre). , their current prison population is about 12,257 inmates, which comes to about 0.12% of their entire population. The incarceration rate has been on the rise since 2010, with a 15% increase over the past eight years.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Administratively, Portugal is divided into 308 municipalities (&quot;municípios&quot; or &quot;concelhos&quot;), which after a reform in 2013 are subdivided into 3,092 civil parishes (). Operationally, the municipality and civil parish, along with the national government, are the only legally local administrative units identified by the government of Portugal (for example, cities, towns or villages have no standing in law, although may be used as catchment for the defining services). &quot;Continental Portugal&quot; is agglomerated into 18 districts, while the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are governed as autonomous regions; the largest units, established since 1976, are either mainland Portugal and the autonomous regions of Portugal (Azores and Madeira).

The 18 districts of mainland Portugal are: Aveiro, Beja, Braga, Bragança, Castelo Branco, Coimbra, Évora, Faro, Guarda, Leiria, Lisbon, Portalegre, Porto, Santarém, Setúbal, Viana do Castelo, Vila Real and Viseu – each district takes the name of the district capital.

Within the European Union NUTS system, Portugal is divided into nine regions: the Azores, Alentejo, Algarve, Centro, Lisboa, Madeira, Norte, Oeste e Vale do Tejo and Península de Setúbal, and with the exception of the Azores and Madeira, NUTS areas are subdivided into 28 subregions. Population estimates from 2023.

==Economy==


Portugal is a developed and high-income country with a GDP per capita of 83% of the EU27 average in 2023, and a HDI of 0.874 (the 42nd highest in the world) in 2021. It holds the 13th largest gold reserve in the world at its national central bank, has the 8th largest proven reserves of lithium, with total exports representing 47.4% of its GDP in 2023. Portugal has been a net beneficiary of the European Union budget since it joined the union, then known as EEC, in 1986.

By the end of 2023, GDP (PPP) was $47,209 per capita, according to the World Bank. In 2023, Portugal had the 5th lowest GDP per capita (PPP) of the eurozone out of 20 members, and the 8th lowest of the European Union out of 27 member-states. In 2022, labour productivity had fallen to the fourth lowest among the 27 member-states of the European Union (EU) and was 35% lower than the EU average.

Portugal was an original member of the eurozone. The national currency, the euro (€) started transitioning from the Portuguese Escudo in 2000 and consolidated in 2002. Portugal&#x27;s central bank is the &quot;Banco de Portugal&quot;, an integral part of the European System of Central Banks. Most industries, businesses and financial institutions are concentrated in the Lisbon and Porto metropolitan areas – the Setúbal, Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Leiria and Faro districts are the biggest economic centres outside these two main areas.

Since the Carnation Revolution of 1974, which culminated in the end of one of Portugal&#x27;s most notable phases of economic expansion, a significant change has occurred in the nation&#x27;s annual economic growth. After the turmoil of the 1974 revolution, Portugal tried to adapt to a changing modern global economy, a process that continues. Since the 1990s, Portugal&#x27;s public consumption-based economic development model has changed to a system focused on exports, private investment and the development of the high-tech sector. Consequently, business services have overtaken more traditional industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear and cork (Portugal is the world&#x27;s leading cork producer), wood products and beverages.

In the 2010s, the Portuguese economy suffered its most severe recession since the 1970s, which resulted in the country receiving a 78-billion-euro bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in May 2011. By end of 2023, the share of debt as percentage of GDP fell below 100 percent, to 97.9%, and fell further to 95.3% by the end of 2024.

In 2024, the average gross salary was €1,602 per month, and the minimum wage, which is regulated by law, is €870 per month (paid 14 times per annum) as of 2025. The Global Competitiveness Report for 2019, published by the World Economic Forum, placed Portugal 34th. The Numbeo quality of life index placed Portugal 20th in the world in 2023.

Companies listed on Euronext Lisbon stock exchange like EDP, Galp, Jerónimo Martins, Mota-Engil, Novabase, Semapa, Portucel Soporcel, Portugal Telecom and Sonae, are among the largest corporations by number of employees, net income or international market share. The Euronext Lisbon is the major stock exchange and part of the pan-European group of stock exchanges Euronext. The PSI-20 is Portugal&#x27;s most selective and widely known stock index.

The OECD economic reports since 2018 show recovery. Rents and house prices have skyrocketed in Portugal, particularly Lisbon, where rents jumped 37% in 2022. The 8% inflation rate in the same year exacerbated the problem. According to the IMF, Portugal&#x27;s economic recovery from the COVID pandemic in 2022 was substantially better than the EU average. Although modest, economic growth continued in 2023 while inflation continued decreasing to 5%. In 2024 the annual inflation continued a downward trend ending at 2.3% and accompanied by a small economic growth. In 2025, the economy is expected to continue growing at 1.9 annually, while inflation is forecast at 2.1% for the fiscal year. These moderately optimistic indicators are supported by increased private consumption, investment, employment growth and unemployment easing.

Agriculture in Portugal is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units. However, the sector also includes larger scale intensive farming, export-oriented agrobusinesses. The country produces a variety of crops and livestock products, including: tomatoes, citrus, green vegetables, rice, wheat, barley, maize, olives, oilseeds, nuts, cherries, bilberry, table grapes, edible mushrooms, dairy products, poultry and beef. According to FAO, Portugal is the top producer of cork and carob in the world, accounting for about 50% and 30% of world production, respectively. It is the third largest exporter of chestnuts and third largest European producer of pulp. Portugal is among the world&#x27;s top ten largest olive oil producers and fourth largest exporter. The country is one of the world&#x27;s largest exporters of wine, reputed for its fine wines. Forestry has played an important economic role among the rural communities and industry. In 2001, the gross agricultural product accounted for 4% of the economy; in 2022 it was 2%.

=== Tourism ===
Travel and tourism is an important part of Portugal&#x27;s economy. As of 2023, nearly half of real GDP growth was due to the tourism sector, with tourism accounting for 16.5% of GDP. It has been necessary for the country to focus upon its niche attractions, such as health, nature and rural tourism, to stay ahead of its competitors.

Portugal is among the top 20 most-visited countries in the world, receiving more than 26,5 million foreign tourists by 2023. In 2014, Portugal was elected &quot;The Best European Country&quot; by &quot;USA Today&quot;. In 2017, Portugal was elected both &quot;Europe&#x27;s Leading Destination&quot; and in 2018 and 2019, &quot;World&#x27;s Leading Destination&quot;

Tourist hotspots in Portugal are: Lisbon, Cascais, Algarve, Madeira, Nazaré, Fátima, Óbidos, Porto, Braga, Guimarães and Coimbra. Lisbon attracts the sixteenth-most tourists among European cities (with seven million tourists occupying the city&#x27;s hotels in 2006).

=== Science and technology ===
Scientific and technological research activities are mainly conducted within a network of R&amp;D units belonging to public universities and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the INETI – Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inovação and the INRB – Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biológicos. Funding and management of this system is conducted under the authority of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education and the (Foundation for Science and Technology). The largest R&amp;D units of the public universities by volume of research grants and peer-reviewed publications, include biosciences research institutions.

Among the largest non-state-run research institutions are the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência and the Champalimaud Foundation, a neuroscience and oncology research centre. National and multinational high-tech and industrial companies, are responsible for research and development projects. One of the oldest learned societies of Portugal is the Sciences Academy of Lisbon, founded in 1779.

Iberian bilateral state-supported research efforts include the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory and the Ibercivis distributed computing platform. Portugal is a member of pan-European scientific organizations. These include the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), ITER, and the European Southern Observatory (ESO). Portugal has the largest aquarium in Europe, the Lisbon Oceanarium, and have other notable organizations focused on science-related exhibits and divulgation, like the state agency &quot;Ciência Viva&quot;, the Science Museum of the University of Coimbra, the National Museum of Natural History at the University of Lisbon, and the Visionarium. The European Innovation Scoreboard 2011, placed Portugal-based innovation 15th, with increase in innovation expenditure and output. Portugal was ranked 31st in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

=== Transport ===
Portugal has a road network, of which almost are part of system of 44 motorways. On many highways, a toll needs to be paid (see Via Verde). Vasco da Gama bridge is the longest bridge in the EU (the second longest in Europe) at .

Continental Portugal&#x27;s territory is serviced by four international airports located near the principal cities of Lisbon, Porto, Faro and Beja. Lisbon&#x27;s geographical position makes it a stopover for many foreign airlines at several airports within the country. The primary flag-carrier is TAP Air Portugal, although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country.

The most important airports are in Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Funchal (Madeira), and Ponta Delgada (Azores), managed by the national airport authority group ANA – Aeroportos de Portugal. A new airport, to replace the current Lisbon airport, has been planned for more than 50 years, but it has been always postponed by a series of reasons.

A national railway system that extends throughout the country and into Spain, is supported and administered by Comboios de Portugal (CP). Rail transport of passengers and goods is derived using the of railway lines currently in service, of which are electrified and about allow train speeds greater than . The railway network is managed by Infraestruturas de Portugal while the transport of passengers and goods are the responsibility of CP, both public companies. In 2006, the CP carried 133,000,000 passengers and of goods.

The major seaports are located in Sines, Leixões, Lisbon, Setúbal, Aveiro, Figueira da Foz, and Faro. The two largest metropolitan areas have subway systems: Lisbon Metro and Metro Sul do Tejo light rail system in the Lisbon metropolitan area, and Porto Metro light metro system in the Porto Metropolitan Area, each with more than of lines. Coimbra is currently developing a Bus rapid transit system, Metro Mondego, as is the Algarve, Algarve Metrobus.

In Portugal, Lisbon tram services have been supplied by the &quot;Companhia de Carris de Ferro de Lisboa&quot; (Carris), for over a century. In Porto, a tram network, of which only a tourist line on the shores of the Douro remains, began construction on 12 September 1895 (a first for the Iberian Peninsula). All major cities and towns have their own local urban transport network, as well as taxi services.

=== Energy ===
Portugal has considerable resources of wind and hydropower. In 2006, the world&#x27;s then largest solar power plant, the Moura Photovoltaic Power Station, began operating, while the world&#x27;s first commercial wave power farm, the Aguçadoura Wave Farm, opened in the Norte region (2008). By 2006, 66% of the country&#x27;s electrical production was from coal and fuel power plants, while 29% were derived from hydroelectric dams, and 6% by wind energy. In 2008, renewable energy resources were producing 43% of the nation&#x27;s electricity, even as hydroelectric production decreased with severe droughts. As of 2010, electricity exports had outnumbered imports and 70% of energy came from renewable sources.

Portugal&#x27;s national energy transmission company, Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN), uses modelling to predict weather, especially wind patterns. Before the solar/wind revolution, Portugal had generated electricity from hydropower plants on its rivers for decades. New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night; then water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal&#x27;s distribution system is now two-way. It draws electricity small generators, like rooftop solar panels.

== Demographics ==
Statistics Portugal () estimates that, by 31 December 2023, the population was 10,639,726, of which 52.2% was female and 47.8% male. In 2024 the median life expectancy was 82.8 years and United Nations projections point to 90 or above, by 2100. The population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history, with a single religion (Catholic church) and language.

Despite good economic development, the Portuguese have been the shortest in Europe since around 1890. This emerging height gap started in the 1840s and increased. A driving factor was modest real wage growth, given late industrialization and economic growth compared to the European core. Another determinant was delayed human capital formation.

Portugal has to deal with low fertility levels: the country has experienced a sub-replacement fertility rate since the 1980s. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated at 1.36 children born/woman, one of the lowest in the world, similarly to countries such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, all well below the replacement rate of 2.1, and considerably below the high of 5 children born per woman in 1911. In 2016, 53% of births were to unmarried women. Portugal&#x27;s population has been steadily ageing and was the 11th oldest in the world, with a median age of 46 years in 2023. In the same year, it had the world&#x27;s 4th highest number of citizens over 65 years, at 21.8% of the whole population.

The structure of Portuguese society shows social inequality, which in 2019 placed the country 24th in the Social Justice Index, in the EU. In 2018, Portugal&#x27;s parliament approved a budget plan for 2019 that included tax breaks for returning emigrants in a bid to attract back those who left during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. According to projections by the national statistics office, Portugal&#x27;s population will fall to 7.7 million by 2080 from 10.6 million and the population will continue to age.

According to a National Statistics Institute (INE) study, conducted shortly after the 2021 census, between 2022 and 2023, 6,4 million people aged between 18 and 74 years old identified themselves as White (84%), more than 262,000 identify as Mixed-race (3%), nearly 170,000 as Black (2%), 57,000 as Asian (&lt;1%), and 47,500 as Romani (&lt;1%)

=== Urbanization ===
Based on commuting patterns, OECD and Eurostat define eight metropolitan areas of Portugal. Only two have populations over 1 million, and since the 2013 local government reform, these are the only two which also have administrative legal status of metropolitan areas: Lisbon and Porto, Several smaller metropolitan areas (Algarve, Aveiro, Coimbra, Minho and Viseu) also held this status from 2003 to 2008, when they were converted into intermunicipal communities, whose territories are roughly based on the NUTS III statistical regions.
=== Immigration ===
In 2023 Portugal had 10,639,726 inhabitants, of whom 1,044,606 accounted for legal resident foreigners Resident foreigners make up approximately 10% of the population. These figures do not include Portuguese citizens of foreign descent, as in Portugal it is illegal to collect data based on ethnicity. For instance, more than 340,000 resident foreigners who acquired Portuguese citizenship between 2008 and 2022 - and thus constitute around 3.27% of the country&#x27;s population in 2022 - were not taken into account in immigration figures as they became official Portuguese citizens. In 2022 alone, almost 21,000 foreign residents acquired Portuguese citizenship, of which 11,170 were female and 9,674 were male.

Portugal, for long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), became a country of net immigration. The influx of immigrants didn&#x27;t come just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories, but from other parts of the world as well. Even though in the aftermath of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Portugal&#x27;s emigration rate increased to 6.9‰ in 2022, it was still well below the immigration rate of around 11.3‰. It is also noteworthy that the overwhelming majority of Portuguese emigrants tend to leave the country for short periods, with 56.8% of those having left the country in 2022 doing so for less than a year.

Since the 1990s, along with a boom in construction, several new waves of Ukrainian, Brazilian, Afro-Portuguese and other Africans have settled in the country. Romanians, Moldovans, Kosovo Albanians, Russians, Bulgarians, and Chinese have also migrated to the country. The numbers of Venezuelan, Pakistani, Indian, and Bangladeshi migrants are also significant. Moreover, Portugal&#x27;s Romani population is estimated at 50,000.

It is estimated that over 30,000 seasonal, often illegal immigrants work in agriculture, mainly southern cities such as Odemira where they are often exploited by organised seasonal workers&#x27; networks. These migrants, who frequently arrive without due documentation or work contracts, make up over 90% of agricultural workers in the south of Portugal. Most are Southeast Asians from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Thailand. In the interior of the Alentejo there are many African workers. Significant numbers also come from Eastern Europe, Moldova, Ukraine, Romania and Brazil.

In addition, a significant number of EU citizens, mostly from Italy, France, Germany or other northern European countries, have become permanent residents in the country. There is also a large expatriate community made up of Britons, Canadians and people from the United States of America. The British community is mostly composed of retired pensioners who live in the Algarve and Madeira.

A National Statistics Institute (INE) study, conducted between 2022 and 2023, found out that 1.4 million people, (13% of the population) have immigrant background, in which 947,500 are first generation immigrants, concentrated mainly in the Lisbon metropolitan area and the Algarve. It is noteworthy that the survey was only carried out amongst people living legally in the country for at least one year at the time of the interview and that in 2022 the statistical office figures suggested that 16.1% of the country&#x27;s population or 1,683,829 people were first generation immigrants.

=== Religion ===

Roman Catholicism, which has a long history in Portugal, remains the dominant religion. Portugal has no official religion, though in the past, the Catholic Church in Portugal was the state religion.

According to the 2021 Census, 80.2% of the Portuguese population was Roman Catholic Christian. The country has small Protestant, Latter-day Saint, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Eastern Orthodox Church, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Baháʼí, Buddhist, Jewish and Spiritist communities. Influences from African Traditional Religion and Chinese Traditional Religion are also felt among many people, particularly in fields related with Traditional Chinese Medicine and Traditional African Herbal Medicine. Some 14.1% of the population declared themselves to be non-religious.

Portugal is a secular state: church and state were formally separated during the First Portuguese Republic, and this was reiterated in the 1976 Portuguese Constitution. Other than the Constitution, the two most important documents relating to religious freedom in Portugal are the 1940 Concordata (later amended in 1971) between Portugal and the Holy See and the 2001 Religious Freedom Act. Many Portuguese holidays, festivals and traditions have a Christian origin or connotation.

=== Languages ===


Portuguese is the official language of Portugal. Mirandese is also recognised as a co-official regional language in some municipalities of North-Eastern Portugal. It is part of the Astur-Leonese group of languages. An estimate of between 6,000 and 7,000 Mirandese speakers has been documented for Portugal. Furthermore, a particular dialect known as Barranquenho, spoken in Barrancos, is also officially recognised and protected in Portugal since 2021. Minderico, a sociolect of the Portuguese language, is spoken by around 500 people in the town of Minde.

According to the International English Proficiency Index, Portugal has a high proficiency level in English, higher than those of other Romance-speaking European countries like Spain, Italy or France.

=== Education ===
The educational system is divided into preschool (for those under age six), basic education (nine years, in three stages, compulsory), secondary education (three years, compulsory since 2010), and higher education (subdivided in university and polytechnic education). Universities are usually organised into faculties. Institutes and schools are also common designations for autonomous subdivisions of Portuguese higher education institutions.

The total adult literacy rate in Portugal was 99.8% in 2021. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018, Portugal scored around the OECD average in reading, mathematics and science. In reading and mathematics, mean performance in 2018 was close to the level observed in 2009 to 2015; in science, mean performance in 2018 was below that of 2015, and returned close to the level observed in 2009 and 2012, near below average.

About 47.6% of college-age citizens (20 years old) attend one of Portugal&#x27;s higher education institutions (compared with 50% in the United States and 35% in the OECD on average). In addition to being a destination for international students, Portugal is also among the top places of origin for international students. All higher education students, both domestic and international, totalled 380,937 in 2005.

Portuguese universities have existed since 1290. The oldest Portuguese university was first established in Lisbon before moving to Coimbra. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the Americas (the &quot;Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho&quot; of Rio de Janeiro) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the &quot;Escola Médico-Cirúrgica&quot; of Goa) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the University of Lisbon.

The Bologna process has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of &quot;numerus clausus&quot; is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), international students, foreign students from the Lusosphere, degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions (academic transfer), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.

Most student costs are supported with public money. Portugal has entered into cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.

=== Health ===

In 2025, Portugal ranked as 23rd best healthcare system in the world, which was visibly lower than the previous 12th place in the 2000 World Health Organisation ranking of best public health systems in the world. The health system is characterised by three coexisting systems: the National Health Service (&quot;Serviço Nacional de Saúde&quot;, SNS), special social health insurance schemes for certain professions (health subsystems) and voluntary private health insurance. The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 55% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 43% by private insurance schemes and another 12% by mutual funds.The Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS. Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralisation efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care. The SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.

Similarly to other &#x27;Eur-A countries&#x27;, (Western Europe), most Portuguese die from noncommunicable diseases. Mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is around 30,000 deaths per year, a third of all annual deaths, but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with cerebrovascular disease being the single biggest killer in Portugal, with more than 11,000 deaths per year. Oncological diseases represent 22% of all deaths in the country, with lung and breast cancer cases being lower, and cervical and prostate cancer being more frequent. Diabetes mortality rates have been decreasing, from 4.5% in 2010 down to 2.8% in 2021.

Portugal&#x27;s infant mortality rate (IMR) stood at 2,25 deaths per 1,000 live births as of 2024. A Eurostat opinion-poll in 2023 found that 55.4% of adults rated their health as good or very good, the third lowest rate collected in the European Union. The largest university hospital in the country is Hospital de Santa Maria, Lisbon.

==Culture==
Portugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various civilisations that have crossed the European continent and Mediterranean, or were introduced when it played an active role during the Age of Discovery. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), Portugal modernised its public cultural facilities, in addition to the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation established in 1956 in Lisbon.

These include the Belém Cultural Centre in Lisbon, Serralves Foundation and the Casa da Música, both in Porto, as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls that were built or renovated in many municipalities across the country. Portugal is home to 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, ranking it 9th in Europe and 18th in the world.

=== Architecture ===
Traditional architecture is distinctive and include the Manueline, also known as Portuguese late Gothic a sumptuous, composite Portuguese style of architectural ornamentation of the first decades of the 16th century, followed by Pombaline style of the 18th century.

A 20th-century interpretation of traditional architecture, Soft Portuguese style, appears extensively in major cities, especially Lisbon. Modern Portugal has given the world renowned architects like Eduardo Souto de Moura, Álvaro Siza Vieira (both Pritzker Prize winners) and Gonçalo Byrne. In Portugal Tomás Taveira is also noteworthy, particularly for stadium design. The azulejo is a mainstream, typical element among Portugal&#x27;s traditional building materials and construction techniques.

=== Cuisine ===
Portuguese cuisine is diverse, part of the Atlantic diet. A significant ingredient in the Portuguese diet is dry cod (&quot;bacalhau&quot; in Portuguese). They say that the Portuguese have mastered 365 different ways to prepare codfish, meaning a cod dish for each day of the year, to name a few recipes: bacalhau à Brás, bacalhau à Gomes de Sá, bacalhau com natas, bacalhau à Minhota, bacalhau espiritual, bacalhau à Lagareiro, bacalhau assado, bacalhau à Zé do Pipo, pastéis de bacalhau. Other fish recipes include grilled sardines, mackerel, sea bream, and caldeirada, a tomato-based stew that can be made from several types of fish or shellfish, with a mix of onion, garlic, bay leaf, potatoes, peppers, parsley.

Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of the customary beef, pork, chicken, goat, lamb or duck meat, include &quot;cozido à portuguesa&quot;, &quot;feijoada&quot;, &quot;frango de churrasco&quot;, &quot;leitão&quot; (roast suckling pig), &quot;chanfana&quot; and &quot;carne de porco à alentejana&quot;. Typical fast food dishes include the Francesinha (Frenchie) from Porto and &quot;bifanas&quot; (grilled pork) or &quot;prego&quot; (grilled beef) sandwiches. An egg custard tart pastry, the pastel de nata, typical and popular among the Portuguese, became popular abroad and among foreign tourists visiting the country as well.

Portuguese wines have enjoyed recognition since the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god Bacchus, due to its climate. Some of the best Portuguese wines are Vinho Verde, Alvarinho, Vinho do Douro, Vinho do Alentejo, Vinho do Dão, Vinho da Bairrada and the sweet Port Wine, Madeira Wine, and the Moscatel from Setúbal and Favaios.

=== Visual art ===


Portugal has a rich history in painting. The first well-known painters dating back to the 15th century – like Nuno Gonçalves and Vasco Fernandes – were part of the late Gothic painting period. During the Renaissance, Portuguese painting was highly influenced by Northern European painting. In the Baroque period Josefa de Óbidos and Vieira Lusitano were the most prolific painters.
José Malhoa, known for his work &quot;Fado&quot;, and Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (who painted the portraits of Teófilo Braga and Antero de Quental) were both references in naturalist painting.

The 20th century saw the arrival of Modernism, and along with it came the most prominent Portuguese painters: Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso, who was heavily influenced by French painters, particularly the Delaunays (Robert and Sonia). Among his best-known works is &quot;Canção Popular – a Russa e o Fígaro&quot;. Other great modernist painters/writers include Carlos Botelho and Almada Negreiros, friend to the poet Fernando Pessoa, who painted Pessoa&#x27;s portrait. He was deeply influenced by both Cubist and Futurist trends.

Prominent international figures in visual arts today include painters Vieira da Silva, Júlio Pomar, Joana Vasconcelos, Julião Sarmento and Paula Rego.

=== Literature ===
Portuguese literature, one of the earliest Western literatures, developed through text as well as song. Until 1350, the Portuguese-Galician troubadours spread their literary influence to most of the Iberian Peninsula, like King D. Dinis (1261–1325) who became famous for his poetry. Other kings would write and sponsor works of literature across Portuguese history, like D. Fernando (1367–1383) who supported Pêro Menino in writing o &quot;Livro da Falcoaria&quot;

Adventurer and poet Luís de Camões (c. 1524–1580) wrote the epic poem &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; (&quot;The Lusiads&quot;), with Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; as his main influence. Modern Portuguese poetry is rooted in neoclassic and contemporary styles, as exemplified by Bocage (1765–1805), Antero de Quental (1842–1891) and Fernando Pessoa (1888–1935). Modern Portuguese literature is represented by authors such as Almeida Garrett, Camilo Castelo Branco, Eça de Queirós, Fernando Pessoa, Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen, António Lobo Antunes, Miguel Torga and Agustina Bessa-Luís. Particularly popular and distinguished is José Saramago, recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Literature.

=== Music ===
The Music of Portugal encompasses a wide variety of genres. The traditional one is the Portuguese folk music which has deep roots in local customs, utilising instruments such as bagpipes (&quot;gaita&quot;), drums, flutes, tambourines, accordions and ukuleles (&quot;cavaquinho&quot;). Within Portuguese folk music is the renowned genre of Fado, a melancholic urban music originated in Lisbon in the 19th century, probably inside bohemian environments, usually associated with the Portuguese guitar and &quot;saudade&quot;, or longing. Coimbra fado, a unique type of &quot;troubadour serenading&quot; fado, is also noteworthy. Internationally notable performers include Amália Rodrigues, Carlos Paredes, José Afonso, Mariza, Carlos do Carmo, António Chainho, Mísia, Dulce Pontes and Madredeus.

In addition to Folk, Fado and Classical music, other genres are present at Portugal like pop and other types of modern music, particularly from North America and the United Kingdom, as well as a wide range of Portuguese, Caribbean, Lusophone African and Brazilian artists and bands. Artists with international recognition include Dulce Pontes, Moonspell, Buraka Som Sistema, Blasted Mechanism, David Carreira and The Gift, with the three latter being nominees for a MTV Europe Music Award.

Portugal has several summer music festivals, such as &quot;Festival Sudoeste&quot; in Zambujeira do Mar, &quot;Festival de Paredes de Coura&quot; in Paredes de Coura, &quot;Festival Vilar de Mouros&quot; near Caminha, &quot;Boom Festival&quot; in Idanha-a-Nova municipality, &quot;NOS Alive&quot;, &quot;Sumol Summer Fest&quot; in Ericeira, &quot;Rock in Rio Lisboa&quot; and &quot;Super Bock Super Rock&quot; in Greater Lisbon, plus &quot;Primavera Sound Porto&quot; and &quot;MEO Marés Vivas&quot; in the Greater Porto area.

The student festivals of &quot;Queima das Fitas,&quot; which are major events in a number of cities across Portugal, show every year a selection of well-established, high-profile musicians and bands to the public as well as newer, on the rise, upcoming success artists seeking definite recognition. In 2005, Portugal held the MTV Europe Music Awards, in Pavilhão Atlântico, Lisbon. Furthermore, Portugal won the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 in Kyiv with the song &quot;Amar pelos dois&quot; presented by Salvador Sobral, and subsequently hosted the 2018 contest.

Portuguese classical music constitutes an important chapter of Western music. Over the centuries, names of composers and performers have stood out, such as the troubadours Martim Codax and King Denis I, the polyphonists Duarte Lobo, Filipe de Magalhães, Manuel Cardoso and Pedro de Cristo, the organist Manuel Rodrigues Coelho, the composer and harpsichordist Carlos Seixas, the singer Luísa Todi, symphonist and pianist João Domingos Bomtempo or composer and musicologist Fernando Lopes Graça. The golden period of Portuguese music coincided, arguably, with the heyday of classical polyphony in the 17th century (Escola de Évora, Santa Cruz de Coimbra). Among the great current references, the names of pianists Artur Pizarro, Maria João Pires and Sequeira Costa, violinist Carlos Damas, composer Emmanuel Nunes, composer and conductor Álvaro Cassuto stand out. The most important symphony orchestras are the Fundação Gulbenkian, the Porto National Orchestra and the Portuguese Symphony Orchestra. When it comes to opera, the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos in Lisbon is the most representative.

=== Sport ===

Football is the most popular sport in Portugal. There are several football competitions ranging from local amateur to world-class professional level. All-time greats Eusébio, Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo are major symbols of Portuguese football history. Portuguese football managers are also noteworthy, with José Mourinho and Abel Ferreira among the most renowned.

The Portugal national football team has won one UEFA European Championship title: the UEFA Euro 2016, with a 1–0 victory in the final over France, the tournament hosts. In addition, Portugal finished first in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, second in the Euro 2004, third in the 1966 FIFA World Cup and fourth in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. At youth level, Portugal have won two FIFA World Youth Championships.

S.L. Benfica, Sporting CP and FC Porto are the largest sports clubs by popularity and number of trophies, often known as &quot;os três grandes&quot; (&quot;the big three&quot;). They have won eight titles in the European UEFA club competitions and present in 21 finals. The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) – &quot;Federação Portuguesa de Futebol&quot; – annually hosts the Algarve Cup, a women&#x27;s football tournament.

Other than football, many Portuguese sports clubs, including the &quot;big three&quot;, compete in other sports events with a varying level of success and popularity, these include roller hockey, basketball, futsal, handball, volleyball and athletics. The Portuguese national rugby union team qualified for the 2027 Rugby World Cup and the Portuguese national rugby sevens team has played in the World Rugby Sevens Series.

Road cycling, with Volta a Portugal the most important race, is a popular sports event and includes professional cycling teams such as Sporting CP, Boavista, Clube de Ciclismo de Tavira and União Ciclista da Maia. In motorsport, Portugal is noted for the Rally of Portugal, and the Estoril and Algarve Circuits as well as the revived Porto Street Circuit which holds a stage of the WTCC every two years, as well as for a number of internationally noted racers such as Miguel Oliveira, Tiago Monteiro, António Félix da Costa, Filipe Albuquerque, Pedro Lamy, Armindo Araújo and others in a range of varied motorsports.

In water, Portugal has three major sports: swimming, water polo and surfing. Portugal had success in canoeing with several world and European champions, such as olympic medalist Fernando Pimenta. Annually, the country hosts one of the stages of the World Surf League men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s &quot;Championship Tour&quot;, the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal at the Supertubos in Peniche. Northern Portugal has its own original martial art, &quot;Jogo do Pau&quot;, in which fighters use staffs to confront one or several opponents. Other popular sport-related recreational outdoor activities include airsoft, fishing, golf, hiking, hunting and orienteering. Portugal is one of the world&#x27;s leading golf destinations.

<text>A piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound when its keys are depressed, activating an action mechanism where hammers strike strings. Modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys, tuned to a chromatic scale in equal temperament. A musician who specializes in piano is called a pianist.

There are two main types of piano: the grand piano and the upright piano. The grand piano offers better sound and more precise key control, making it the preferred choice when space and budget allow. The grand piano is also considered a necessity in venues hosting skilled pianists. The upright piano is more commonly used because of its smaller size and lower cost.

When a key is depressed, the strings inside are struck by felt-coated wooden hammers. The vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies the sound by coupling the acoustic energy to the air. When the key is released, a damper stops the string&#x27;s vibration, ending the sound. Most notes have three strings, except for the bass, which graduates from one to two. Notes can be sustained when the keys are released by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument, which lift the dampers off the strings. The sustain pedal allows pianists to connect and overlay sound, and achieve expressive and colorful sonority.

In the 19th century, influenced by Romantic music trends, the fortepiano underwent changes such as the use of a cast iron frame (which allowed much greater string tensions) and aliquot stringing which gave grand pianos a more powerful sound, a longer sustain, and a richer tone. Later in the century, as the piano became more common it allowed families to listen to a newly published musical piece by having a family member play a simplified version. 

The piano is widely employed in classical, jazz, traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances, accompaniment, and for composing, songwriting and rehearsals. Despite its weight and cost, the piano&#x27;s versatility, the extensive training of musicians, and its availability in venues, schools, and rehearsal spaces have made it a familiar instrument in the Western world.

==History==
The piano was based on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments. Pipe organs had been used since antiquity, and as such the development of pipe organs enabled instrument builders to learn about creating keyboard mechanisms for sounding pitches. The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers, which were introduced in the Middle Ages in Europe. During the Middle Ages, there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings. By the 17th century, the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed. In a clavichord the strings are struck by tangents, while in a harpsichord they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key. Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown instrument builders the most effective ways to construct the case, soundboard, bridge, and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings.

The English word &quot;piano&quot; is a shortened form of the Italian &#x27;, derived from &#x27; (&quot;harpsichord with soft and loud&quot;). Variations in volume (loudness) are produced in response to the pianist&#x27;s &quot;touch&quot; (pressure on the keys): the greater the pressure, the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings and the louder the sound produced and the stronger the &quot;attack&quot;. Invented in 1700, the fortepiano was the second keyboard instrument (in addition to the clavichord which predates it) to allow gradations of volume and tone according to how forcefully or softly the player presses or strikes the keys, unlike the pipe organ and harpsichord.

===Invention===

The invention of the piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori of Padua, Italy, who was employed by Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany, as the Keeper of the Instruments. Cristofori was an expert harpsichord maker and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments. This knowledge of keyboard mechanisms and actions helped him to develop the first pianos. It is not known when Cristofori first built a piano. An inventory made by his employers, the Medici family, indicates the existence of a piano by 1700. The three Cristofori pianos that survive today date from the 1720s. Cristofori named the instrument &quot;un cimbalo di cipresso di piano e forte&quot; (&quot;a keyboard of cypress with soft and loud&quot;), abbreviated over time as &quot;pianoforte&quot;, &quot;fortepiano&quot;, and later reduced to only &quot;piano&quot;.

Cristofori&#x27;s great success was designing a stringed keyboard instrument in which the notes are struck by a hammer. The hammer must strike the string but not remain in contact with it, because continued contact would damp the sound and stop the string from vibrating and making sound. This means that after striking the string, the hammer must quickly fall from (or rebound from) the strings. Moreover, the hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently (thus preventing notes from being re-played by accidental rebound), and it must return to a position in which it is ready to play again almost immediately after its key is depressed, so the player can repeat the same note rapidly when desired. Cristofori&#x27;s piano action was a model for the many approaches to piano actions that followed in the next century.

Cristofori&#x27;s early instruments were made with thin strings and were much quieter than the modern piano, though they were louder and had more sustain compared to the clavichord—the only previous keyboard instrument capable of dynamic nuance responding to the player&#x27;s touch, the velocity with which the keys are pressed. While the clavichord allows expressive control of volume and sustain, it is relatively quiet even at its loudest. The harpsichord produces a sufficiently loud sound, especially when a coupler joins each key to both manuals of a two-manual harpsichord, but it offers no dynamic or expressive control over individual notes. The piano in some sense offers the best of both of the older instruments, combining the ability to play at least as loudly as a harpsichord with the ability to continuously vary dynamics by touch.

===Early fortepiano===
Cristofori&#x27;s new instrument remained relatively unknown until an Italian writer, Scipione Maffei, wrote an enthusiastic article about it in 1711, including a diagram of the mechanism, that was translated into German and widely distributed. Most of the next generation of piano builders started their work based on reading this article. One of these builders was Gottfried Silbermann, better known as an organ builder. Silbermann&#x27;s pianos were virtual copies of Cristofori&#x27;s, with one important addition: Silbermann invented the forerunner of the modern sustain pedal, which lifts all the dampers from the strings simultaneously. This innovation allows the pianist to sustain the notes that they have depressed even after their fingers are no longer pressing down the keys. As such, by holding a chord with the sustain pedal, pianists can relocate their hands to a different register of the keyboard in preparation for a subsequent section.

Silbermann showed Johann Sebastian Bach one of his early instruments in the 1730s, but Bach did not like the instrument at that time, saying that the higher notes were too soft to allow a full dynamic range. Although this earned him some animosity from Silbermann, the criticism was apparently heeded. Bach did approve of a later instrument he saw in 1747 and even served as an agent in selling Silbermann&#x27;s pianos. &quot;Instrument: piano et forte genandt&quot;—a reference to the instrument&#x27;s ability to play soft and loud—was an expression that Bach used to help sell the instrument when he was acting as Silbermann&#x27;s agent in 1749.

Piano making flourished during the late 18th century in the Viennese school, which included Johann Andreas Stein (who worked in Augsburg, Germany) and the Viennese makers Nannette Streicher (daughter of Stein) and Anton Walter. Viennese-style pianos were built with wood frames, two strings per note, and leather-covered hammers. Some of these Viennese pianos had the opposite coloring of modern-day pianos; the natural keys were black and the accidental keys white. It was for such instruments that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed his concertos and sonatas, and replicas of them are built in the 21st century for use in authentic-instrument performance of his music. The pianos of Mozart&#x27;s day had a softer tone than 21st century pianos or English pianos, with less sustaining power. The term &quot;fortepiano&quot; now distinguishes these early instruments (and modern re-creations) from later pianos.

===Modern piano===


In the period from about 1790 to 1860, the Mozart-era piano underwent significant changes that led to the modern structure of the instrument. This revolution was in response to a preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful, sustained piano sound, which was made possible by the ongoing Industrial Revolution with resources such as high-quality piano wire for strings and precision casting for the production of massive iron frames that could withstand the tremendous tension of the strings. Over time, the tonal range of the piano was also increased from the five octaves of Mozart&#x27;s day to the seven octave (or more) range found on today&#x27;s pianos.

Early technological progress in the late 18th century owed much to the firm of Broadwood. John Broadwood joined with another Scot, Robert Stodart, and a Dutchman, Americus Backers, to design a piano in the harpsichord case—the origin of the &quot;grand&quot;. This was achieved by about 1777. They quickly gained a reputation for the splendour and powerful tone of their instruments, with Broadwood constructing pianos that were progressively larger, louder, and more robustly constructed. They sent pianos to both Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, and were the first firm to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves and a fifth during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (Beethoven used the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820. The Viennese makers similarly followed these trends; however the two schools used different piano actions: Broadwoods used a more robust action, whereas Viennese instruments were more sensitive.

By the 1820s, the center of piano innovation had shifted to Paris, where the Pleyel firm manufactured pianos used by Frédéric Chopin, and the Érard firm manufactured those used by Franz Liszt. In 1821, Sébastien Érard invented the double escapement action, which incorporated a &quot;repetition lever&quot; (also called the &quot;balancier&quot;) that permitted repeating a note even if the key had not return to its resting position. This facilitated rapid playing of repeated notes, a musical device exploited by Liszt. When the invention became public, as revised by Henri Herz, the double escapement action gradually became standard in grand pianos and is still incorporated into all grand pianos currently produced in the 2000s. Other improvements of the mechanism included the use of firm felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather or cotton. Felt, which Jean-Henri Pape was the first to use in pianos in 1826, was a more consistent material, permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased. The sostenuto pedal (see below), invented in 1844 by Jean-Louis Boisselot and copied by the Steinway firm in 1874, allowed for a wider range of effects.One innovation that helped create the powerful sound of the modern piano was the use of a massive, strong, cast iron frame. Also called the &quot;plate&quot;, the iron frame sits atop the soundboard, and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string tension that can exceed 20 tons () in total for a modern grand piano. The single piece cast iron frame for square piano was patented in 1825 in Boston by Alpheus Babcock, combining the metal hitch pin plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). Babcock later worked for the Chickering &amp; Mackays firm who patented the first full iron frame for grand pianos in 1843. Composite forged metal frames were preferred by many European makers until the American system was fully adopted by the early 20th century. The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings. In 1834, the Webster &amp; Horsfal firm of Birmingham brought out a form of piano wire made from cast steel; it was &quot;so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly.&quot; A better steel wire was developed in 1840 by the Viennese firm Martin Miller, and a period of innovation and intense competition ensued, with rival brands of piano wire being tested against one another at international competitions, leading ultimately to the modern form of piano wire.

Several important advances included changes to the way the piano was strung. There are one string for each note in the bass, two for each note in the tenor, and three for each note in the tenor. The use of a Capo d’Astro bar instead of agraffes in the uppermost treble allowed the hammers to strike the strings in their optimal position, greatly increasing that area&#x27;s power. The implementation of over-stringing (also called cross-stringing), in which the strings are placed in two separate planes, each with its own bridge height, allowed greater length to the bass strings and optimized the transition from unwound tenor strings to the iron or copper-wound bass strings. Over-stringing was invented by Pape during the 1820s and first patented for use in grand pianos in the United States by Henry Steinway Jr. in 1859.

Some piano makers added variations to enhance the tone of each note, such as Pascal Taskin (1788), Collard &amp; Collard (1821), and Julius Blüthner, who developed Aliquot stringing in 1893. These systems were used to strengthen the tone of the highest register of notes on the piano, which up until this time were viewed as being too weak-sounding. Each used more distinctly ringing, undamped vibrations of sympathetically vibrating strings to add to the tone, except the Blüthner Aliquot stringing, which uses an additional fourth string in the upper two treble sections. While the hitchpins of these separately suspended Aliquot strings are raised slightly above the level of the usual tri-choir strings, they are not struck by the hammers but rather are damped by attachments of the usual dampers. Eager to copy these effects, Theodore Steinway invented &quot;duplex scaling&quot;, which used short lengths of non-speaking wire bridged by the &quot;aliquot&quot; throughout much of the upper range of the piano, always in locations that caused them to vibrate sympathetically in conformity with their respective overtones—typically in doubled octaves and twelfths.

===Variations in shape and design===
Some early pianos had shapes and designs that are no longer in use. The square piano (not truly square, but rectangular) was cross strung at an extremely acute angle above the hammers, with the keyboard set along the long side. This design is attributed to Christian Ernst Friderici (a pupil of Gottfried Silbermann) in Germany and Johannes Zumpe in England, and it was improved by changes first introduced by Guillaume-Lebrecht Petzold in France and Alpheus Babcock in the United States. Square pianos were built in great numbers through the 1840s in Europe and the 1890s in the United States, and saw the most visible change of any type of piano: the iron-framed, over-strung squares manufactured by Steinway &amp; Sons were more than two-and-a-half times the size of Zumpe&#x27;s wood-framed instruments from a century before. Their overwhelming popularity was the result of inexpensive construction and price, although their tone and performance were limited by narrow soundboards, simple actions and string spacing that made proper hammer alignment difficult.
The tall, vertically strung upright grand was arranged like a grand set on end, with the soundboard and bridges above the keys and tuning pins below them. &quot;Giraffe pianos&quot;, &quot;pyramid pianos&quot; and &quot;lyre pianos&quot; were arranged in a somewhat similar fashion, using evocatively shaped cases. The very tall cabinet piano was introduced about 1805 and was built through the 1840s. It had strings arranged vertically on a continuous frame with bridges extended nearly to the floor, behind the keyboard and very large &quot;sticker action&quot;. The short cottage upright or &quot;pianino&quot; with vertical stringing—made popular by Robert Wornum around 1815—was built into the 20th century. They are informally called &quot;birdcage pianos&quot; because of their prominent damper mechanism. The oblique upright, popularized in France by Roller &amp; Blanchet during the late 1820s, was diagonally strung throughout its compass. The tiny spinet upright was manufactured from the mid-1930s until recent times. The low position of the hammers required the use of a &quot;drop action&quot; to preserve a reasonable keyboard height. Modern upright and grand pianos attained their present, 2000-era forms by the end of the 19th century. While improvements have been made in manufacturing processes, and many individual details of the instrument continue to receive attention, and a small number of acoustic pianos in the 2010s are produced with MIDI recording and digital sound module-triggering capabilities, the 19th century was the era of the most dramatic innovations and modifications of the instrument.

==Types==
Modern pianos have two basic configurations, the grand piano and the upright piano, with various styles of each. There are also specialized and novelty pianos, electric pianos based on electromechanical designs, electronic pianos that synthesize piano-like tones using oscillators, and digital pianos using digital samples of acoustic piano sounds.

=== Grand ===

In a grand piano, the frame and strings are horizontal, with the strings extending away from the keyboard. The action lies beneath the strings and uses gravity as its means of return to a state of rest. Grand pianos range in length from approximately . Some of the lengths have been given more-or-less customary names, which vary from time to time and place to place, but might include:

* Baby grand – around 
* Parlor grand or boudoir grand – 
* Concert grand – between )

All else being equal, longer pianos with longer strings have larger, richer sound and lower inharmonicity of the strings. Inharmonicity is the degree to which the frequencies of overtones (known as partials or harmonics) sound sharp relative to whole multiples of the fundamental frequency. This results from the piano&#x27;s considerable string stiffness; as a struck string decays, its harmonics vibrate from a point very slightly from its termination toward the center (or more flexible part) of the string. The inharmonicity may also result from imperfections within the string, such as rust on plain strings and dirt in the windings of bass strings. The higher the partial, the further sharp it runs. Pianos with shorter and thicker string (i.e., small pianos with short string scales) have more inharmonicity. The greater the inharmonicity, the more the ear perceives it as harshness of tone.

The inharmonicity of piano strings requires that octaves be &quot;stretched,&quot; or tuned to a lower octave&#x27;s corresponding sharp overtone rather than to a theoretically correct octave. If octaves are not stretched, single octaves sound in tune, but double—and notably triple—octaves are unacceptably narrow. Stretching a small piano&#x27;s octaves to match its inherent inharmonicity level creates an imbalance among all the instrument&#x27;s intervallic relationships. In a concert grand, however, the octave &quot;stretch&quot; retains harmonic balance, even when aligning treble notes to a harmonic produced from three octaves below. This lets close and widespread octaves sound pure, and produces virtually beatless perfect fifths. This gives the concert grand a brilliant, singing and sustaining tone quality—one of the principal reasons that full-size grands are used in the concert hall. Smaller grands satisfy the space and cost needs of domestic use; as well, they are used in some small teaching studios and smaller performance venues.

===Upright===

Upright pianos, also called vertical pianos, are more compact with a vertical structure of the frame and strings. The mechanical action structure of the upright piano was invented in London in 1826 by Robert Wornum, and upright models became the most popular model for domestic use. Upright pianos take up less space than a grand piano and as such are a better size for use in private homes for domestic music-making and practice. The hammers move horizontally and return to their resting position via springs, which are susceptible to degradation. Upright pianos with unusually tall frames and long strings were sometimes marketed as &quot;upright grand&quot; pianos, but that label is misleading. Some authors classify modern pianos according to their height and to modifications of the action that are necessary to accommodate the height. Upright pianos are generally less expensive than grand pianos. Upright pianos are widely used in churches, community centers, schools, music conservatories and university music programs as rehearsal and practice instruments, and they are popular models for in-home purchase.

* The top of a spinet model barely rises above the keyboard. Unlike all other pianos, the spinet action is located below the keys, operated by vertical wires that are attached to the backs of the keys. 
* Console pianos, which have a compact action (shorter hammers than a large upright has), but because the console&#x27;s action is above the keys rather than below them as in a spinet, a console almost always plays better than a spinet does. Console pianos are a few inches shorter than studio models.
* Studio pianos are around tall. This is the shortest cabinet that can accommodate a full-sized action located above the keyboard.
* Anything taller than a studio piano is called an upright. (Technically, any piano with a vertically oriented soundboard could be called an upright, but that word is often reserved for the full-size models.)

===Specialized===
The toy piano, introduced in the 19th century, is a small piano-like instrument that generally uses round metal rods to produce sound, rather than strings. The US Library of Congress recognizes the toy piano as a unique instrument with the subject designation, Toy Piano Scores: M175 T69.

In 1863, Henri Fourneaux invented the player piano, which plays itself from a piano roll. A machine perforates a performance recording into rolls of paper, and the player piano replays the performance using pneumatic devices. Modern equivalents of the player piano include the Bösendorfer CEUS, Yamaha Disklavier and QRS Pianomation, using solenoids and MIDI rather than pneumatics and rolls.

A silent piano is an acoustic piano having an option to silence the strings by means of an interposing hammer bar. They are designed for private silent practice, to avoid disturbing others.

Edward Ryley invented the transposing piano in 1801. This rare instrument has a lever under the keyboard to move the keyboard relative to the strings, so a pianist can play in a familiar key while the music sounds in a different key.
The minipiano is an instrument patented by the Brasted brothers of the Eavestaff Ltd. piano company in 1934. This instrument has a braceless back and a soundboard positioned below the keys—long metal rods pull on the levers to make the hammers strike the strings. The first model, known as the &quot;Pianette&quot;, was unique in that the tuning pins extended through the instrument, so it could be tuned at the front.

The prepared piano, present in some contemporary art music from the 20th and 21st century is a piano which has objects placed inside it to alter its sound, or has had its mechanism changed in some other way. The scores for music for prepared piano specify the modifications, for example, instructing the pianist to insert pieces of rubber, paper, metal screws, or washers in between the strings. These objects mute the strings or alter their timbre.

Some Viennese fortepianos incorporated percussion effects, brought into action by levers. These would be used in pieces such as Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Rondo alla Turca&quot;. 

The pedal piano is a rare type of piano that has a pedal keyboard at the base, designed to be played by the feet. The pedals may play the existing bass strings on the piano, or rarely, the pedals may have their own set of bass strings and hammer mechanisms. While the typical intended use for pedal pianos is to enable a keyboardist to practice pipe organ music at home, a few players of pedal piano use it as a performance instrument.

Wadia Sabra had a microtone piano manufactured by Pleyel in 1920. Abdallah Chahine later constructed his quartertone &quot;Oriental piano&quot; with the help of Austrian Hofmann.

===Electric, electronic, and digital===

With technological advances, amplified electric pianos (1929), electronic pianos (1970s), and digital pianos (1980s) have been developed. The first electric pianos from the late 1920s used metal strings with a magnetic pickup, an amplifier and a loudspeaker. The electric pianos that became most popular in pop and rock music in the 1960s and 1970s, such as the Fender Rhodes use metal tines in place of strings and use electromagnetic pickups similar to those on an electric guitar. The resulting electrical, analogue signal can then be amplified with a keyboard amplifier or electronically manipulated with effects units. In classical music, electric pianos are mainly used as inexpensive rehearsal or practice instruments. Electric pianos, particularly the Fender Rhodes, became important instruments in 1970s funk and jazz fusion and in some rock music genres.

Electronic pianos are non-acoustic; they do not have strings, tines or hammers, but are a type of analog synthesizer that simulates or imitates piano sounds using oscillators and filters that synthesize the sound of an acoustic piano. They must be connected to a keyboard amplifier and speaker to produce sound (however, some electronic keyboards have a built-in amp and speaker). Alternatively, a person can play an electronic piano with headphones in quieter settings.

Digital pianos are also non-acoustic and do not have strings or hammers. They use digital audio sampling technology to reproduce the acoustic sound of each piano note accurately. They also must be connected to a power amplifier and speaker to produce sound (however, most digital pianos have a built-in amp and speaker). Alternatively, a person can practise with headphones to avoid disturbing others. Digital pianos can include sustain pedals, weighted or semi-weighted keys, multiple voice options (e.g., sampled or synthesized imitations of electric piano, Hammond organ, violin, etc.), and MIDI interfaces. MIDI inputs and outputs connect a digital piano to other electronic instruments or musical devices. For example, a digital piano&#x27;s MIDI out signal could be connected by a patch cord to a synth module, which would allow the performer to use the keyboard of the digital piano to play modern synthesizer sounds. Early digital pianos tended to lack a full set of pedals, but the synthesis software of later models such as the Yamaha Clavinova series synthesised the sympathetic vibration of the other strings (such as when the sustain pedal is depressed) and full pedal sets can now be replicated. The processing power of digital pianos has enabled highly realistic pianos using multi-gigabyte piano sample sets with as many as ninety recordings, each lasting many seconds, for each key under different conditions (e.g., there are samples of each note being struck softly, loudly, with a sharp attack, etc.). Additional samples emulate sympathetic resonance of the strings when the sustain pedal is depressed, key release, the drop of the dampers, and simulations of techniques such as re-pedalling.

Digital, MIDI-equipped pianos can output a stream of MIDI data, or record and play MIDI format files on digital storage media, similar in concept to a pianola. The MIDI file records the physics of a note rather than its resulting sound and recreates the sounds from its physical properties (e.g., which note was struck and with what velocity). Computer based software, such as Modartt&#x27;s 2006 Pianoteq, can be used to manipulate the MIDI stream in real time or subsequently to edit it. This type of software may use no samples but synthesize a sound based on aspects of the physics that went into the creation of a played note.

===Hybrid instruments===

By the 2000s, some pianos included an acoustic grand piano or upright piano combined with MIDI electronic features. Such a piano can be played acoustically, or the keyboard can be used as a MIDI controller, which can trigger a synthesizer module or music sampler. Some electronic feature-equipped pianos such as the Yamaha Disklavier electronic player piano, introduced in 1987, are outfitted with electronic sensors for recording and electromechanical solenoids for player piano-style playback. Sensors record the movements of the keys, hammers, and pedals during a performance, and the system saves the performance data as a Standard MIDI File (SMF). On playback, the solenoids move the keys and pedals and thus reproduce the original performance. Modern Disklaviers typically include an array of electronic features, such as a built-in tone generator for playing back MIDI accompaniment tracks, speakers, MIDI connectivity that supports communication with computing devices and external MIDI instruments, additional ports for audio and SMPTE input/output (I/O), and Internet connectivity. Disklaviers have been manufactured in the form of upright, baby grand, and grand piano styles (including a nine-foot concert grand). Reproducing systems have ranged from relatively simple, playback-only models to professional models that can record performance data at resolutions that exceed the limits of normal MIDI data. The unit mounted under the keyboard of the piano can play MIDI or audio software on its CD.

==Construction and components==
Pianos can have over 12,000 individual parts, supporting six functional features: keyboard, hammers, dampers, bridge, soundboard, and strings. Many parts of a piano are made of materials selected for strength and longevity. This is especially true of the outer rim, which is most commonly made of hardwood, typically hard maple or beech, and its massiveness serves as an essentially immobile object from which the flexible soundboard can best vibrate. According to Harold A. Conklin, the purpose of a sturdy rim is so that, &quot;... the vibrational energy will stay as much as possible in the soundboard instead of dissipating uselessly in the case parts, which are inefficient radiators of sound.&quot;

Hardwood rims are commonly made by laminating thin (hence flexible) strips of hardwood, bending them to the desired shape immediately after the application of glue. The bent plywood system was developed by C.F. Theodore Steinway in 1880 to reduce manufacturing time and costs. Previously, the rim was constructed from several pieces of solid wood, joined and veneered, and European makers used this method well into the 20th century. A modern exception, Bösendorfer (an Austrian manufacturer of high-quality pianos) constructs their inner rims from solid spruce, the same wood that the soundboard is made from, which is notched to allow it to bend; rather than isolating the rim from vibration, their &quot;resonance case principle&quot; allows the framework to resonate more freely with the soundboard, creating additional coloration and complexity of the overall sound.

The thick wooden posts on the underside (grands) or back (uprights) of the piano stabilize the rim structure and are made of softwood for stability. The requirement of structural strength, fulfilled by stout hardwood and thick metal, makes a piano heavy. Even a small upright can weigh , and the Steinway concert grand (Model D) weighs . The largest piano available on the general market, the Fazioli F308, weighs .

The pinblock, which holds the tuning pins in place, is another area where toughness is important. It is made of hardwood (typically hard maple or beech) and is laminated for strength, stability and longevity. Piano strings (also called piano wire), which must endure years of extreme tension and hard blows, are made of high carbon steel. They are manufactured to vary as little as possible in diameter, since all deviations from uniformity introduce tonal distortion. The bass strings of a piano are made of a steel core wrapped with one or two layers of copper wire, to increase their mass whilst retaining flexibility. If all strings throughout the piano&#x27;s compass were individual (monochord), the massive bass strings would overpower the upper ranges. Makers compensate for this with the use of double (bichord) strings in the tenor and triple (trichord) strings throughout the treble.
The plate (harp), or metal frame, of a piano is usually made of cast iron. A massive plate is advantageous. Since the strings vibrate from the plate at both ends, an insufficiently massive plate would absorb too much of the vibrational energy that should go through the bridge to the soundboard. While some manufacturers use cast steel in their plates, most prefer cast iron. Cast iron is easy to cast and machine, has flexibility sufficient for piano use, is much more resistant to deformation than steel, and is especially tolerant of compression. Plate casting is an art, since dimensions are crucial and the iron shrinks about one percent during cooling. Including an extremely large piece of metal in a piano is potentially an aesthetic handicap. Piano makers overcome this by polishing, painting, and decorating the plate. Plates often include the manufacturer&#x27;s ornamental medallion. 

In an effort to make pianos lighter, Alcoa worked with Winter and Company piano manufacturers to make pianos using an aluminum plate during the 1940s. Aluminum piano plates were not widely accepted and were discontinued. Prior to this, a piano made almost entirely of aluminum was placed aboard the airship Hindenburg.

The numerous parts of a piano action are generally made from hardwood, such as maple, beech, or hornbeam; however, since World War II, makers have also incorporated plastics. Early plastics used in some pianos in the late 1940s and 1950s, proved problematic when they lost strength after a few decades of use. Beginning in 1961, the New York branch of the Steinway firm incorporated Teflon, a synthetic material developed by DuPont, for some parts of its Permafree grand action in place of cloth bushings, but abandoned the experiment in 1982 due to excessive friction and a &quot;clicking&quot; that developed over time; Teflon is &quot;humidity stable&quot; whereas the wood adjacent to the Teflon swells and shrinks with humidity changes, causing problems. More recently, the Kawai firm built pianos with action parts made of more modern materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastic, and the piano parts manufacturer Wessell, Nickel and Gross has launched a new line of carefully engineered composite parts. Thus far these parts have performed reasonably, but it will take decades to know if they equal the longevity of wood.
In all but the lowest quality pianos, the soundboard is made of spruce boards glued together along the side grain. Spruce&#x27;s high ratio of strength to weight minimizes acoustic impedance while offering strength sufficient to withstand the downward force of the strings. The best piano makers use quarter-sawn, defect-free spruce of close annular grain, carefully seasoning it over a long period before fabricating the soundboards. This is the same material that is used in quality acoustic guitar soundboards. Low-cost pianos often have plywood soundboards.

The design of the piano hammers requires having the hammer felt be soft enough so that it will not create loud, very high harmonics that a hard hammer will cause. The hammer must be lightweight enough to move swiftly when a key is pressed; yet at the same time, it must be strong enough so that it can hit strings hard when the player strikes the keys forcefully for fortissimo playing or sforzando accents.

===Keyboard===
In the early years of piano construction, keys were commonly made from sugar pine. In the 2010s, they are usually made of spruce or basswood. Spruce is typically used in high-quality pianos. Black keys were traditionally made of ebony, and the white keys were covered with strips of ivory. However, since ivory-yielding species are now endangered and protected by treaty, or are illegal in some countries, makers use plastics almost exclusively. Also, ivory tends to chip more easily than plastic. Legal ivory can still be obtained in limited quantities. Yamaha developed a plastic called &quot;Ivorite&quot; intended to mimic the look and feel of ivory; other manufacturers have done likewise.

Almost every modern piano has 52 white keys and 36 black keys for a total of 88 keys (seven octaves plus a minor third, from A0 to C8). Many older pianos only have 85 keys (seven octaves from A0 to A7). Some piano manufacturers have extended the range further in one or both directions. For example, the Imperial Bösendorfer has nine extra keys at the bass end, giving a total of 97 keys and an eight octave range. These extra keys are sometimes hidden under a small hinged lid that can cover the keys to prevent visual disorientation for pianists unfamiliar with the extra keys, or the colours of the extra white keys are reversed (black instead of white). More recently, Australian manufacturer Stuart &amp; Sons created a piano with 108 keys, going from C0 to B8, covering nine full octaves. The extra keys are the same as the other keys in appearance. The extra keys are added primarily for increased resonance from the associated strings; that is, they vibrate sympathetically with other strings whenever the damper pedal is depressed and thus give a fuller tone. Only a very small number of works composed for piano actually use these notes. Toy piano company Schoenhut manufactures grands and uprights with only 44 or 49 keys and a shorter distance between the keyboard and the pedals. These are true pianos with working mechanisms and strings.
A rare variant of the piano called the &quot;Emánuel Moór Pianoforte&quot; has double keyboards, one lying above the other. It was invented by Hungarian composer and pianist Emánuel Moór. The lower keyboard has the usual 88 keys, whilst the upper keyboard has 76 keys. When the upper keyboard is played, an internal mechanism pulls down the corresponding key on the lower keyboard, but an octave higher. This lets a pianist reach two octaves with one hand, impossible on a conventional piano. Due to its double keyboard, musical works that were originally created for double-manual harpsichord, such as the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; by Bach, become much easier to play, since playing on a conventional single keyboard piano involves complex and hand-tangling cross-hand movements. The design also features a special fourth pedal that couples the lower and upper keyboard, so when playing on the lower keyboard the note one octave higher also plays. Only about 60 Emánuel Moór Pianofortes were made, mostly by Bösendorfer. Other piano manufacturers, such as Bechstein, Chickering, and Steinway &amp; Sons, also manufactured a few.

Pianos have been built with alternative keyboard systems, e.g., the Jankó keyboard.

===Pedals===
Pianos have had pedals, or some close equivalent, since the earliest days. (In the 18th century, some pianos used levers pressed upward by the player&#x27;s knee instead of pedals.) Most grand pianos in the US have three pedals: the soft pedal (una corda), sostenuto, and sustain pedal (from left to right, respectively), while in Europe, the standard is two pedals: the soft pedal and the sustain pedal. Most modern upright pianos also have three pedals: soft pedal, practice pedal and sustain pedal, though older or cheaper models may lack the practice pedal. In Europe the standard for upright pianos is two pedals: the soft and the sustain pedals.

The sustain pedal (or damper pedal) is often simply called &quot;the pedal&quot;, since it is the most frequently used. It is the rightmost pedal in the group. It lifts the dampers from all strings, sustaining played notes. In addition, it broadens the overall tone by allowing all strings, including those not directly played, to reverberate sympathetically.

Sympathetic vibration of strings is strongest among notes that are harmonically related to the sounded pitches, i.e., a played 440 Hz &quot;A&quot; note would evoke the higher octave &quot;A&quot; notes, but since piano strings vibrate with a great complexity of overtones, the harmonic and inharmonic interaction is among all notes is enormous.

The soft pedal or &quot;una corda&quot; pedal is placed leftmost in the row of pedals. In grand pianos it shifts the entire action/keyboard assembly to the right (a very few instruments have shifted left) so that the hammers hit two of the three strings for each note. In the earliest pianos whose unisons were bichords rather than trichords, the action shifted so that hammers hit a single string, hence the name &quot;una corda&quot;, or &#x27;one string&#x27;. The effect is to soften the note as well as change the tone. In upright pianos, depressing the pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings, allowing the hammers to strike with less force. This produces a slightly softer sound but no change in timbre.

On grand pianos, the middle pedal is a sostenuto pedal. This pedal keeps raised any damper already raised at the moment the pedal is depressed. This makes it possible to sustain selected notes (by depressing the sostenuto pedal before those notes are released) while the player&#x27;s hands are free to play additional notes (which do not sustain). This can be useful for musical passages with low bass pedal points, in which a bass note is sustained while a series of chords changes over top of it, and other otherwise tricky parts. On many upright pianos, the middle pedal is called the &quot;practice&quot; or &quot;celeste&quot; pedal. This drops a piece of felt between the hammers and strings, greatly muting the sound of the instrument. This pedal can be shifted while depressed, into a &quot;locking&quot; position.

There are also non-standard variants. On some pianos (grands and verticals), the middle pedal can be a bass sustain pedal: that is, when it is depressed, the dampers lift off the strings only in the bass section. Players use this pedal to sustain a single bass note or chord over many measures, while playing the melody in the treble section.
The rare transposing piano (an example of which was owned by Irving Berlin) has a middle pedal that functions as a clutch that disengages the keyboard from the mechanism, so the player can move the keyboard to the left or right with a lever. This shifts the entire piano action so the pianist can play music written in one key so that it sounds in a different key.

Some piano companies have included extra pedals other than the standard two or three. On the Stuart and Sons pianos as well as the largest Fazioli piano, there is a fourth pedal to the left of the principal three. This fourth pedal works in the same way as the soft pedal of an upright piano, moving the hammers closer to the strings. The Crown and Schubert Piano Company also produced a four-pedal piano.

Wing and Son of New York offered a five-pedal piano from approximately 1893 through the 1920s. There is no mention of the company past the 1930s. Labeled left to right, the pedals are Mandolin, Orchestra, Expression, Soft, and Forte (Sustain). The Orchestral pedal produced a sound similar to a tremolo feel by bouncing a set of small beads dangling against the strings, enabling the piano to mimic a mandolin, guitar, banjo, zither and harp, thus the name Orchestral. The Mandolin pedal used a similar approach, lowering a set of felt strips with metal rings in between the hammers and the strings (aka rinky-tink effect). This extended the life of the hammers when the Orch pedal was used, a good idea for practicing, and created an echo-like sound that mimicked playing in an orchestral hall.

The &quot;pedalier&quot; piano, or pedal piano, is a rare type of piano that includes a pedalboard so players can use their feet to play bass register notes, as on an organ. There are two types of pedal piano. On one, the pedal board is an integral part of the instrument, using the same strings and mechanism as the manual keyboard. The other, rarer type, consists of two independent pianos (each with separate mechanics and strings) placed one above the other—one for the hands and one for the feet. This was developed primarily as a practice instrument for organists, though there is a small repertoire written specifically for the instrument.

==Mechanics==

When the key is struck, a chain reaction occurs to produce the sound. First, the key raises the &quot;wippen&quot; mechanism, which forces the jack against the hammer roller (or &quot;knuckle&quot;). The hammer roller then lifts the lever carrying the hammer. The key also raises the damper; and immediately after the hammer strikes the wire it falls back, allowing the wire to resonate and thus produce sound. When the key is released the damper falls back onto the strings, stopping the wire from vibrating, and thus stopping the sound. The vibrating piano strings themselves are not very loud, but their vibrations are transmitted to a large soundboard that moves air and thus converts the energy to sound. The irregular shape and off-center placement of the bridge ensure that the soundboard vibrates strongly at all frequencies. The raised damper allows the note to sound until the key (or sustain pedal) is released.

There are three factors that influence the pitch of a vibrating wire.
* Length: All other factors the same, the shorter the wire, the higher the pitch.
* Mass per unit length: All other factors the same, the thinner the wire, the higher the pitch.
* Tension: All other factors the same, the tighter the wire, the higher the pitch.

A vibrating wire subdivides itself into many parts vibrating at the same time. Each part produces a pitch of its own, called a partial. A vibrating string has one fundamental and a series of partials. The purest combination of two pitches is when one is double the frequency of the other.

For a repeating wave, the velocity equals the wavelength times the frequency ,

On the piano string, waves reflect from both ends. The superposition of reflecting waves results in a standing wave pattern, but only for wavelengths , where is the length of the string. Therefore, the only frequencies produced on a single string are . Timbre is largely determined by the content of these harmonics. Different instruments have different harmonic content for the same pitch. A real string vibrates at harmonics that are not perfect multiples of the fundamental. This results in a little inharmonicity, which gives richness to the tone but causes significant tuning challenges throughout the compass of the instrument.

Striking the piano key with greater velocity increases the amplitude of the waves and therefore the volume. From &quot;pianissimo&quot; () to &quot;fortissimo&quot; () the hammer velocity changes by almost a factor of a hundred. The hammer contact time with the string shortens from 4 milliseconds at to less than 2 ms at . If two wires adjusted to the same pitch are struck at the same time, the sound produced by one reinforces the other, and a louder combined sound of shorter duration is produced. If one wire vibrates out of synchronization with the other, they subtract from each other and produce a softer tone of longer duration.

==Maintenance==
=== Tuning ===
Pianos are heavy and powerful, yet delicate instruments. Over the years, professional piano movers have developed special techniques for transporting both grands and uprights, which prevent damage to the case and to the piano&#x27;s mechanical elements. Pianos need regular tuning to keep them on correct pitch. The hammers of pianos are voiced to compensate for gradual hardening of the felt, and other parts also need periodic regulation. Pianos need regular maintenance to ensure the felt hammers and key mechanisms are functioning properly. Aged and worn pianos can be rebuilt or reconditioned by piano rebuilders. Strings eventually must be replaced. Often, by replacing a great number of their parts and adjusting them, old instruments can perform as well as new pianos.

Piano tuning involves adjusting the tensions of the piano&#x27;s strings with a specialized wrench, thereby aligning the intervals among their tones so that the instrument is in tune. While guitar and violin players tune their own instruments, pianists usually hire a piano tuner, a specialized technician, to tune their pianos. The piano tuner uses special tools. The meaning of the term &quot;in tune&quot; in the context of piano tuning is not simply a particular fixed set of pitches. Fine piano tuning carefully assesses the interaction among all notes of the chromatic scale, different for every piano, and thus requires slightly different pitches from any theoretical standard. Pianos are usually tuned to a modified version of the system called equal temperament. In all systems of tuning, each pitch is derived from its relationship to a chosen fixed pitch, usually the internationally recognized standard concert pitch of A4 (the A above middle C). The term A440 refers to a widely accepted frequency of this pitch: 440 Hz.

The relationship between two pitches, called an interval, is the ratio of their absolute frequencies. Two different intervals are perceived as the same when the pairs of pitches involved share the same frequency ratio. The easiest intervals to identify, and the easiest intervals to tune, are those that are just, meaning they have a simple whole-number ratio. The term &quot;temperament&quot; refers to a tuning system that tempers the just intervals (usually the perfect fifth, which has the ratio 3:2) to satisfy another mathematical property; in equal temperament, a fifth is tempered by narrowing it slightly, achieved by flattening its upper pitch slightly, or raising its lower pitch slightly. A temperament system is also known as a set of &quot;bearings&quot;. Tempering an interval causes it to beat, which is a fluctuation in perceived sound intensity due to interference between close (but unequal) pitches. The rate of beating is equal to the frequency differences of any harmonics that are present for both pitches and that coincide or nearly coincide. Piano tuners have to use their ear to &quot;stretch&quot; the tuning of a piano to make it sound in tune. This involves tuning the highest-pitched strings slightly higher and the lowest-pitched strings slightly lower than what a mathematical frequency table (in which octaves are derived by doubling the frequency) would suggest.

==Playing and technique==

As with any other musical instrument, the piano may be played from written music, by ear, or through improvisation. While some folk and blues pianists were self-taught, in classical and jazz, there are well-established piano teaching systems and institutions, including pre-college graded examinations, university, college and music conservatory diplomas and degrees, ranging from the B.Mus. and M.Mus. to the Doctor of Musical Arts in piano. Piano technique evolved during the transition from harpsichord and clavichord to fortepiano playing and continued through the development of the modern piano. Changes in musical styles and audience preferences over the 19th and 20th century, as well as the emergence of virtuoso performers, contributed to this evolution and to the growth of distinct approaches or schools of piano playing. Although technique is often viewed as only the physical execution of a musical idea, many pedagogues and performers stress the interrelatedness of the physical and mental or emotional aspects of piano playing. Well-known approaches to piano technique include those by Dorothy Taubman, Edna Golandsky, Fred Karpoff, Charles-Louis Hanon and Otto Ortmann.

===Performance styles===
Many classical music composers, including Haydn, Mozart, Schubert and Beethoven, composed for the fortepiano, a rather different instrument than the modern piano. Even composers of the Romantic movement, like Franz Liszt, Frédéric Chopin, Clara and Robert Schumann, Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn, and Johannes Brahms, wrote for pianos substantially different from 2010-era modern pianos. Contemporary musicians may adjust their interpretation of historical compositions from the 17th century to the 19th century to account for sound quality differences between old and new instruments or to changing performance practice.
Starting in Beethoven&#x27;s later career, the fortepiano evolved into an instrument more like the modern piano. Modern pianos were in wide use by the late 19th century. They featured an octave range larger than the earlier fortepiano instrument, adding around 30 more keys to the instrument, which extended the deep bass range and the high treble range. Factory mass production of upright pianos made them more affordable for a larger number of middle-class people. They appeared in music halls and pubs during the 19th century, providing entertainment through a piano soloist, or in combination with a small dance band. Just as harpsichordists had accompanied singers or dancers performing on stage, or playing for dances, pianists took up this role in the late 18th and following centuries.

During the 19th century, American musicians playing for working-class audiences in small pubs and bars, particularly African-American composers, developed new musical genres based on the modern piano. Ragtime music, popularized by composers such as Scott Joplin, reached a broader audience by 1900. The popularity of ragtime music was quickly succeeded by Jazz piano. New techniques and rhythms were invented for the piano, including ostinato for boogie-woogie, and Shearing voicing. George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; broke new musical ground by combining American jazz piano with symphonic sounds. Comping, a technique for accompanying jazz vocalists on piano, was exemplified by Duke Ellington&#x27;s technique. Honky-tonk music, featuring yet another style of piano rhythm, became popular during the same era. Bebop techniques grew out of jazz, with leading composer-pianists such as Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell. In the late 20th century, Bill Evans composed pieces combining classical techniques with his jazz experimentation. In the 1970s, Herbie Hancock was one of the first jazz composer-pianists to find mainstream popularity working with newer urban music techniques such as jazz-funk and jazz-rock.
Pianos have also been used prominently in rock and roll and rock music by performers such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Keith Emerson (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer), Elton John, Ben Folds, Billy Joel, Nicky Hopkins, Rick Wakeman, Freddie Mercury and Tori Amos, to name a few. At a 2023 auction in Sotheby&#x27;s in London, Mercury&#x27;s Yamaha baby grand piano, which he used to compose &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; among other Queen songs, sold for £1.7 million ($2.1 million), which Sotheby&#x27;s state is a record for a composer&#x27;s piano. Modernist styles of music have also appealed to composers writing for the modern grand piano, including John Cage and Philip Glass.

=== Traditional Burmese style ===
Introduced to Burma during the mid-19th century, the piano was quickly indigenized by court musicians and uses a novel &quot;technique of interlocked fingering with both hands extending a single melodic line allowed for agogic embellishment, fleeting grace notes in syncopated spirals around a steady underlying beat found in the bell and clapper time keepers&quot;, adapted to play Mahāgīta compositions. Many Burmese pianists (e.g., Sandayar Hla Htut and Sandayar Chit Swe) adopt a title from the word for piano, &quot;sandaya&quot; ().

==Role==

The piano is a crucial instrument in many Western musical genres. Pianos are used in soloing or melodic roles and as accompaniment instruments. Pianos can be played alone, with a voice or other instrument, in small groups (bands and chamber music ensembles) and large ensembles (big band or orchestra). A large number of composers and songwriters are proficient pianists because the piano keyboard offers an effective means of experimenting with complex melodic and harmonic interplay of chords and trying out multiple, independent melody lines that are played at the same time. Pianos are used by composers doing film and television scoring, as the large range permits composers to try out melodies and bass lines, even if the music will be orchestrated for other instruments.

Bandleaders and choir conductors often learn the piano, as it is an excellent instrument for learning new pieces and songs to lead in performance. Many conductors are trained in piano, because it allows them to play parts of the symphonies they are conducting (using a piano reduction or doing a reduction from the full score), so that they can develop their interpretation. The piano is an essential tool in music education in elementary and secondary schools, and universities and colleges. Most music classrooms and many practice rooms have a piano. Pianos are used to help teach music theory, music history and music appreciation classes, and even non-pianist music professors or instructors may have a piano in their office.

<doc id="23035" wikidata="Q83325" url="?curid=23035" title="Pamela Anderson">
<text>Pamela Denise Anderson (born July 1, 1967) is a Canadian-American actress, model and media personality. She rose to prominence after being selected as the February 1990 &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate of the Month. She went on to make regular appearances on the magazine&#x27;s cover and held the record for the most &quot;Playboy&quot; covers by any individual. Anderson began her acting career on the ABC sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot; (1991–1997), before receiving international recognition for starring as &quot;C.J.&quot; Parker on the action drama series &quot;Baywatch&quot; (1992–1997), which further cemented her status as a sex symbol.

In 1995, personal home videos of Anderson with her then-husband Tommy Lee were stolen and sold as a sex tape, which resulted in a legal fight and made her the subject of controversy. Anderson played Vallery Irons on the syndicated series &quot;V.I.P.&quot; (1998–2002) and starred as Skyler Dayton on the Fox sitcom &quot;Stacked&quot; (2005–2006). Her film credits include &quot;Barb Wire&quot; (1996), &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; (2003), &quot;Borat&quot; (2006), &quot;Baywatch&quot; (2017), and &quot;City Hunter&quot; (2018). She has appeared in her own reality series &quot;Pam: Girl on the Loose&quot; (2008), as well as the &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; franchise (2010–2012, 2018).

Anderson saw a career resurgence in the 2020s after her 2022 Broadway debut portraying Roxie Hart in the long-running musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, the 2023 Netflix documentary &quot;Pamela, a Love Story&quot; (which coincided with the release of her autobiography, &quot;Love, Pamela&quot;), and the 2024 indie-drama film &quot;The Last Showgirl&quot;, the latter of which earned her nominations for the Golden Globe Award and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress.

Anderson has publicly supported various charitable causes, particularly animal rights, and has endorsed PETA activities. She endorses plant-based cooking and serves as the host for the plant-based cooking show, &quot;Pamela&#x27;s Cooking with Love&quot;. She also released the plant-based cookbook &quot;I Love You: Recipes from the Heart&quot; in 2024.

== Early life ==

Anderson was born in Ladysmith, British Columbia, Canada, the daughter of Barry Anderson, a furnace repairman, and Carol, a waitress. Her great-grandfather, , was a Finnish native of , and left the Grand Duchy of Finland (which was an autonomous state within the Russian Empire at the time) for Canada in 1908. He changed his name to Anderson when he arrived as an immigrant. Anderson also has Volga German ancestry on her mother&#x27;s side; her grandmother, ethnically German, was born in Russia in a Mennonite village and immigrated to Canada in 1901. Anderson received press coverage right after her birth as a &quot;Centennial Baby&quot;, having been born on July 1, 1967, the 100th anniversary of Canada&#x27;s official founding via the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. She has a younger brother, Gerry (born 1971), an actor and producer who worked in some of her films and television shows.

Anderson suffered sexual abuse as a child, a fact she revealed publicly in 2014. She said she was molested by a female babysitter from ages 6 to 10, raped by a 25-year-old man when she was age 12, and gang-raped by her boyfriend and six of his friends when she was 14.

Anderson attended Highland Secondary School in Comox, British Columbia. In high school, she played on the volleyball team, and graduated in 1985. In 1988, she moved to Vancouver and worked as a fitness instructor.

== Career ==
===1989–1999: Modeling and acting breakthrough===

In 1989, Anderson attended a BC Lions Canadian Football League game at the BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, where she was featured on the jumbotron while wearing a Labatt&#x27;s Beer T-shirt. The brewing company hired Anderson briefly as a spokesmodel. Inspired by the event, her then-boyfriend Dan Ilicic produced a poster of her image, entitled the &quot;Blue Zone Girl&quot;.

Anderson was flown to Los Angeles for a photo shoot; she appeared as the cover girl on &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s October 1989 issue. She subsequently moved to the United States, settling in LA to further pursue a modelling career. &quot;Playboy&quot; subsequently chose her as Playmate of the Month in their February 1990 issue, in which she appeared in the centerfold portrait. Anderson then elected to have breast implant surgery, increasing her bust size to 34D. She increased her bust size again, to 34DD, several years later. Her &quot;Playboy&quot; career spans 22 years, and she has appeared on more &quot;Playboy&quot; covers than any other model. She has also made numerous appearances in the publication&#x27;s newsstand specials. Anderson wrote the foreword in the &quot;Playboy&quot; coffee table book &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Greatest Covers&quot;. After Anderson moved to Los Angeles, she won a minor role as Lisa, the original &quot;Tool Time Girl&quot;, on the ABC comedy series &quot;Home Improvement&quot;.
Her breakthrough role was as C.J. Parker on &quot;Baywatch&quot;, which she played for five seasons between 1992 and 1997 making her one of the longest-serving cast members. The series has gained her popularity from international viewers and the character of Parker became one of her best-known roles, having been reenacted by multiple high-profile people since. Anderson was paid US$1,500 per episode during the first season. She reprised her role in a reunion movie, &quot;&quot; (2003), and also appeared in commercials for DirecTV in 2007. Anderson was still modelling for &quot;Outdoor Life&quot; and appearing on the cover of the magazine each year. In 1993, Anderson appeared in a music video &quot;Can&#x27;t Have Your Cake&quot; by Vince Neil to promote his first solo album, &quot;Exposed&quot;.

In 1994, she was cast in her first starring film role, in &quot;Raw Justice&quot;, also known as &quot;Good Cop, Bad Cop&quot;, co-starring with Stacy Keach, David Keith, and Robert Hays. Under the alternate title, the film won the Bronze Award at the Worldfest-Charleston in the category for dramatic theatrical films. In 1996, she played Barbara Rose Kopetski in the film &quot;Barb Wire&quot;. The movie, a thinly veiled futuristic remake of &quot;Casablanca&quot;, was not a commercial success. During filming, she had barbed wire tattooed on her left upper arm instead of having it painted on by make-up artists every day, but she had it removed in 2016. In April 1997, she guest-hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. She appeared on one of two covers for the September issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. In September 1998, Anderson starred as Vallery Irons in the Sony Pictures Television syndicated action/comedy-drama series &quot;V.I.P.&quot; created by J. F. Lawton. The series had a successful four-year run. In 1999, she appeared as a man-eating giantess in the music video for &quot;Miserable&quot; by California alternative rock band Lit. She appeared on &quot;The Nanny&quot; as Fran Fine&#x27;s rival, Heather Biblow.

=== 2000–2009: Rise to media prominence ===
Sam Newman House, a pop architecture building constructed in 2001 in St Kilda, Victoria, Australia, has a large image of Anderson&#x27;s face. Sam Newman commissioned local architect Cassandra Fahey to design the building, and used the image with Anderson&#x27;s permission. Permits were issued retroactively when it became a major local landmark and won the award for Best New Residential Building in the RAIA Victorian Architecture Awards. Later that year, Anderson played herself in the Miller Lite TV commercial &quot;Pillow Fight&quot;, the sequel to the brand&#x27;s earlier commercial &quot;Catfight&quot;, with models Tanya Ballinger and Kitana Baker reprising their roles.

In May 2004, Anderson appeared nude on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. Later, she posed naked for &quot;Stuff&quot; and &quot;GQ&quot; magazines. Anderson was also featured on the cover of the fashion magazines &quot;W&quot;, British &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Flare&quot;, and &quot;Elle&quot; Canada and in editorials for Russian &quot;Elle&quot; and &quot;V&quot;.

In 2004, she released the book &quot;Star&quot;, co-written by Eric Shaw Quinn, about a teenager trying to become famous. After this, she began touring the United States, signing autographs for fans nationwide. Her second book, &quot;Star Struck&quot;, released in 2005, is a thinly veiled look at her life with Tommy Lee and the trials of celebrity life. In 2005, Anderson starred in a new Fox comedy series &quot;Stacked&quot; as Skyler Dayton, a party girl who works at a book store. It was cancelled on May 18, 2006, after two seasons. On August 14, 2005, Comedy Central aired the &quot;Roast of Pamela Anderson&quot;.
In December 2005, NBC cut a video of Anderson pole dancing to Elton John&#x27;s &quot;The Red Piano&quot;, saying that the footage was inappropriate for prime time. The video was shown on huge screens during the event, while John played &quot;The Bitch is Back&quot;. 
In March 2006, Anderson received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. In April 2006, she hosted Canada&#x27;s Juno Awards, becoming the first non-singer and model to do so. She also appeared in the 2006 mockumentary &quot;Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot;, in which the title character becomes obsessed with her and plans to abduct and marry her. She appears as herself at a book-signing at the end of the film, confronted by Borat in a staged botched abduction.

Anderson performed on February 13–14, 2008, in a Valentine&#x27;s Day strip-tease act at the Crazy Horse cabaret in Paris. Anderson then starred in the reality series &quot;Pam: Girl on the Loose.&quot;

In December 2009, Anderson guest-starred as &quot;Genie of the Lamp&quot; in the pantomime &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the New Wimbledon Theatre in Wimbledon, in southwest London. Anderson took over the role from comedian Ruby Wax, with former &quot;EastEnders&quot; actress Anita Dobson and comedian Paul O&#x27;Grady also booked for the role.

=== 2010–2021: Shift to reality television ===
In 2010, she appeared in the short film &quot;The Commuter&quot; directed by the McHenry Brothers and shot entirely on the Nokia N8 smartphone as promotion for the phone in the UK. Anderson was featured in a beach-themed editorial, shot by Mario Testino for Brazilian &quot;Vogue&quot;″s June 2013 &quot;Body Issue&quot;.

In November 2010, Anderson appeared on season 4 of &quot;Bigg Boss&quot;, the Indian version of the &quot;Big Brother&quot; television franchise. She stayed as a guest in the house for three days for a reported sum of Rs. 2.5 crores (approx US$550,000). Furthering her involvement in the franchise, Anderson took part in the 12th season of &quot;Big Brother&quot; in the United Kingdom in 2011. In 2012, she appeared as a Special Houseguest on the fourth season of &quot;VIP Brother&quot;, the celebrity spin-off of &quot;Big Brother&quot; in Bulgaria.

On Day 12 of the first season of &quot;Promi Big Brother&quot; in Germany, she entered the house, as a Special Guest Star on the final day. David Hasselhoff, a former &quot;Baywatch&quot; co-star, was a contestant on Days 1 to 5.

Anderson was a contestant on the tenth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnered with professional dancer Damian Whitewood. The season premiered on March 22, 2010. Anderson was eliminated after seven weeks. She also took part in the 15th season all-star edition in 2012 with Tristan MacManus. Anderson and MacManus were eliminated in the first week of competition.

In 2018, she was a contestant on the ninth season of French &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. The season premiered on September 29, 2018. Anderson was eliminated on November 8, 2018.

===2022–present: Return to acting and critical acclaim===

Anderson made her Broadway debut playing Roxie Hart in the Broadway production of &quot;Chicago&quot; for eight weeks from April 12, 2022 to June 5, 2022 (her first time performing since 2019). A few months later in 2023, Netflix released a documentary directed by Ryan White on her life from childhood to the 2022 appearance in &quot;Chicago&quot;, called &quot;Pamela, a Love Story.&quot; It was also produced by her son Brandon Thomas Lee, who received his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination as a producer in the 2023 Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special category for his work on the film. Its release coincided with Anderson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Love, Pamela&quot;, which debuted at number two on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list within its first week of release.

After watching &quot;Pamela, a Love Story&quot;, Gia Coppola wanted to cast Anderson as Shelly in the 2024 drama film &quot;The Last Showgirl.&quot; She sent the script to Anderson&#x27;s then-agent who turned it down within the hour without letting Anderson know about it. Coppola then reached out to Anderson&#x27;s son Brandon through mutual friends, who passed it along to his mother. While Anderson had given up on acting by this point, she accepted the role. She was officially cast in February 2024, starring alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, Dave Bautista, Brenda Song, Kiernan Shipka and Billie Lourd. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2024, with Anderson calling it &quot;the role I have been waiting for my entire career&quot;. Caryn James of the BBC called Anderson &quot;a revelation&quot; and wrote: &quot;The low-key devastation Anderson has captured is the real acting triumph.&quot; David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said Anderson&#x27;s &quot;transformative performance is undeniably affecting, offering illuminating insights into both the character and the actress playing her, who has had to struggle to be taken seriously. This role should mark a turning point on that front.&quot; Anderson received a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance in the film, marking her first Golden Globe Award nomination and the first major industry acting nomination in her career. She was also nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. When asked in an interview about not being nominated for an Academy Award for this role Anderson stated: &quot;I always say the win is in the work...I got to do something I really love, and I needed to do that for my soul.&quot;

Anderson appeared in the November 12, 2024 episode of the &quot;Criterion Closet&quot;, where she discussed her lifelong interest in cinema. The films she selected included Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot;, David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Strada&quot;
and David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Summertime&quot;.

Anderson is slated to appear in &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; and Karim Aïnouz&#x27;s &quot;Rosebush Pruning&quot;.

== Activism ==

=== Animal rights ===
Anderson advocates for animal rights, and is an active member of the animal protection organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

She became the center of controversy when she posed for a PETA ad wearing a bikini with sections drawn on her body dividing it into ribs, rump, shoulder, etc., like a diagram of meat cuts; the ad&#x27;s tagline was &quot;All Animals Have the Same Parts&quot;. The ad was banned in Montreal, Quebec on grounds that it was sexist. Anderson retorted, &quot;In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with burqas – is that next? I didn&#x27;t think that Canada would be so puritanical.&quot;

She became a company spokesperson for FrogAds, Inc. in March 2012. In February 2014, she stripped for a Valentine&#x27;s Day-themed ad for PETA, urging dog lovers to cuddle up with their pets during winter.

On July 8, 2015, Anderson wrote to Putin to save whales. On December 15, 2015, Anderson, representing the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), met with top Kremlin officials regarding animals rights in Russia. On December 15, 2016, Anderson and IFAW officials met with Kremlin officials to discuss animal welfare and conservation.

In December 2015, Anderson, a close friend of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society founder Paul Watson and a long-time supporter and advisory board member, became a full board member in order to further its efforts in opposing the hunting of whales.

=== Anti-pornography ===

Anderson has been critical of pornography. In 2016, she co-authored a viral opinion article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; with Orthodox rabbi Shmuley Boteach, in which they called online pornography a &quot;public hazard of unprecedented seriousness.&quot; The two called for a &quot;sensual revolution&quot; to replace &quot;pornography with eroticism, the alloying of sex with love, of physicality with personality, of the body&#x27;s mechanics with imagination, of orgasmic release with binding relationships.&quot; They later gave a joint lecture at Oxford University to over 1,000 people. Boteach observed: &quot;It can be intimidating to talk about pornography and eroticism alongside an international sex symbol, but I think Pamela has handled it extremely well.&quot; The two also wrote a book together, &quot;Lust for Love&quot; (2018), about how meaningful, passionate sex has been declining, and called for a new sensual revolution that emphasizes partners connecting in the bedroom.

=== Julian Assange ===

In December 2016, in a statement to &quot;People&quot; magazine, Anderson called WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange a &quot;hero&quot;. She stated that he had done everyone &quot;a great service&quot; and that &quot;[e]veryone in the world has benefited because of WikiLeaks,&quot; while decrying how &quot;elaborate plots against him and made up sexual allegations could result in him being extradited to the US – where he would not be treated fairly – because of his exposure of truths.&quot; In April 2019, Anderson expressed anger on Twitter at Assange&#x27;s expulsion from Ecuador&#x27;s London embassy. In May 2019, Anderson visited Assange in Belmarsh prison with Kristinn Hrafnsson, and said she believed Assange to be innocent, saying, &quot;He is a good man, he is an incredible person. I love him, I can&#x27;t imagine what he has been going through.&quot;

In October 2019, Anderson announced she would be travelling to Australia in November 2019 to challenge Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to stand up for Assange. In her announcement, she referenced the &#x27;disparaging remarks&#x27; he made about her in 2018 and challenged him to debate the matter &quot;in front of the Australian people.&quot; She also wrote another letter to Morrison asking him to use his influence to secure Assange&#x27;s release. Morrison replied with a letter, saying that his government would respect Britain&#x27;s judicial process and Assange would not receive any special help. In the text of a speech she had intended to give at Parliament House, Canberra, Anderson said that Assange was suffering &quot;psychological torture&quot; in jail and that &quot;every moment he is in there, he is in danger&quot;.

On January 18, 2021, Anderson spoke on the Fox News show &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot;, asking President Donald Trump to pardon Assange.

=== Additional activism ===

In March 2005, Anderson became a spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics&#x27;s MAC AIDS Fund, which helped people affected by AIDS and HIV. After becoming the official spokesmodel, Anderson raised money during Toronto, Tokyo, Dublin, and Athens events. Anderson became the celebrity spokesperson for the American Liver Foundation and served as the Grand Marshal of the SOS motorcycle ride fundraiser.

In 2009, Anderson wrote an open letter to President Barack Obama urging the legalization of cannabis.

In November 2016, Anderson starred in a video public service announcement produced by the National Limousine Association and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center as part of the Ride Responsibly initiative, titled The Driving Game, which aimed to shed light on the lack of universal driver regulations in the private ground transportation industry.

Anderson once again starred in a video public service announcement produced by the National Limousine Association in January 2018, this time in partnership with Promoting Awareness | Victim Empowerment (PAVE), as part of the Ride Responsibly initiative. The video titled &quot;The Signs&quot; pushes for passenger safety and universal driver regulations in the private ground transportation industry.

In the 2019 Canadian federal election, she endorsed the Green Party of Canada.

After supporting the yellow vests movement, Anderson attended a meeting of the European Spring with Yanis Varoufakis and Benoît Hamon. She appeared as a supporter on election posters of the German DiEM25 campaign in the run-up to the 2019 European Elections.

== Plant-based cooking ==
Anderson became a vegetarian in her early teens after her father went hunting and brought home a &quot;bloodied deer.&quot; She eventually transitioned to a vegan diet in her twenties, and promotes the benefits of a plant-based diet. She served as an executive producer for the 2018 plant-based documentary, &quot;The Game Changers&quot;, along with James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jackie Chan.

In 2024, Anderson published the plant-based cookbook, &quot;I Love You: Recipes From the Heart.&quot; VegNews says it is one of &quot;The Best Vegan Cookbooks of 2024,&quot; Chowhound calls it one of the &quot;15 Best Vegetarian Cookbooks Of 2024,&quot; and SHE Media lists Anderson as one of &quot;22 Celebrity Moms Whose Cookbooks Will Solve Your Dinner Problems.&quot; During her interview with Anderson for Elle, Martha Stewart stated that &quot;I Love You: Recipes From the Heart&quot; is &quot;very nicely done,&quot; and that Anderson drew from French cuisine &quot;in the most simple, beautiful way.&quot; She also told Anderson that her Pierogi recipe &quot;came out beautifully.&quot; Actress and talk show host Drew Barrymore also said that &quot;literally as a cookbook collector&quot; she finds &quot;I Love You: Recipes From the Heart&quot; to be &quot;the most beautiful cookbook I&#x27;ve ever seen - it is stunning.&quot; In addition, after testing a salad recipe in the book, Jessica Wrubel states in Parade magazine that she is &quot;completely smitten with &quot;I Love You&quot; as a whole. Pamela&#x27;s journey into this softer, more personal territory—whether through her recipes or her stories—makes the book feel like an extension of her heart. If you&#x27;ve ever doubted the staying power of Pamela Anderson&#x27;s influence, let this cookbook—and this salad—prove you wrong.&quot;

Beginning in late February 2025, Anderson began hosting the plant-based cooking show, &quot;Pamela&#x27;s Cooking with Love&quot;, on Canada&#x27;s Flavour Network.

== Personal life ==
=== Homes and family ===
Anderson has two children from her first marriage to Tommy Lee, her son Brandon Thomas (born in 1996) and her son Dylan Jagger (born in 1997).
She became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2004 while retaining her Canadian citizenship. After moving to California in 1989, Anderson felt that it was important to become an American citizen in order to vote and one day petition to bring her parents to the U.S. and care for them when they were older.

Anderson purchased a beach home in Malibu, California for $1.8 million in 2001 and attempted to sell it in 2013 for $7.75 million, but later took it off the market. She previously lived in a mansion in Cassis, in the commune of Marseille, France.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, her childhood home in Canada became her permanent residence, and she sold her Malibu home. she lives with her dogs in Ladysmith on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and has a vegetable farm, Arcady.

=== Marriages ===
Anderson has been married a number of times. She married her first husband, Tommy Lee, drummer of Mötley Crüe, on February 19, 1995, after knowing him for only four days. They married on a beach, with Anderson in a white bikini and Lee in boardshorts. Lee was later sentenced to six months in the Los Angeles County Jail for spousal abuse after assaulting Anderson, and they divorced in 1998. A long custody dispute over their sons followed, and was finalized when they were granted joint custody in October 2002. In March 2002, Anderson publicly stated that she had contracted by sharing tattoo needles with Lee, and began writing a regular column for &quot;Jane&quot; magazine. In October 2003, Anderson jokingly said on Howard Stern&#x27;s radio show that she did not expect to live more than 10 or 15 years, but this was taken seriously by many websites and tabloids. By 2015 Anderson had been cured of hepatitis C.

Anderson later married Kid Rock, but after a miscarriage while in Vancouver shooting a new film, &quot;Blonde and Blonder&quot;, Anderson filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.

In September 2007, Anderson stated on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; that she was engaged, and on September 29, Anderson and Rick Salomon applied for a marriage license in Las Vegas. On October 6, 2007, Anderson married Salomon in a small wedding ceremony at The Mirage, between her two nightly appearances at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Hans Klok&#x27;s magic show. The couple separated on December 13, and on February 22, 2008, Anderson requested through the courts that the marriage be annulled, citing fraud. In October 2013, Anderson stated on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; that she and Salomon were &quot;friends with benefits&quot;. In January 2014, she announced that she had remarried Salomon on an unspecified date. Anderson filed for divorce from Salomon in February 2015. The divorce was finalized on April 29, 2015.

She was in a relationship with Adil Rami from 2017 to 2019.

On December 24, 2020, Anderson married Dan Hayhurst, her bodyguard. On January 21, 2022, Anderson announced that she had filed for divorce and split with Hayhurst.

=== Stolen tape ===
In 1995, personal home videos of Anderson with her then-husband Tommy Lee filmed on a houseboat on Lake Mead were stolen and sold as a sex tape, which resulted in a legal fight and made her the subject of controversy. Anderson sued the video distribution company, Internet Entertainment Group, who posted the video on their website ClubLove in November 1997. Anderson was pregnant during the trial and, fearful of the extreme stress causing harm to her pregnancy, dismissed the case. The company began making the tape available to subscribers to its websites again, resulting in triple the normal traffic on the sites. In the 2023 Netflix documentary &quot;Pamela, a Love Story&quot;, Anderson states that there was no confidential agreement over releasing rights to the video, and that she never (by choice) made money from it.

The story of the tape was later portrayed in the Hulu 2022 miniseries &quot;Pam &amp; Tommy&quot;. In her 2023 Netflix documentary &quot;Pamela, a Love Story&quot;, Anderson said that she was not consulted about the production of the series. Critics, journalists, and academics posited that the series was profiting off of Anderson&#x27;s trauma without her consent, and likely doing further harm to her. &quot;Pamela, a Love Story&quot; verified those claims, in Anderson&#x27;s own words. Producers of the series were able to develop the series without her participation, permission, or consent by optioning the rights to an article published by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2014. Some critics felt that this was a similar violation of privacy that mirrored the tape originally being stolen and distributed without Anderson&#x27;s and Lee&#x27;s consent.

<text>In publishing, printers are both companies providing printing services and individuals who directly operate printing presses.

== Origins of printing ==
The history of printers in publishing in Western Europe dates back to the mid-15th century with the invention of the printing press. Johannes Gutenberg, a German goldsmith, is credited with developing movable type in the 1450s. His printing press incorporated various innovative techniques, such as individual metal letter blocks and an oil-based ink, enabling faster and more efficient book production.

== Evolution of printing presses ==

=== The Gutenberg Press ===
Gutenberg&#x27;s press set the foundation for subsequent developments in printing technology. It comprised a heavy wooden frame with a screw mechanism, enabling the even application of pressure to inked type and paper. Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press accelerated the production of books, leading to the spread of knowledge and the democratization of information.

=== Mechanical and industrial advances ===
In the following centuries, printing presses underwent significant advancements. In the 18th century, the steam-powered press was introduced, enabling higher print volumes. Subsequently, the Industrial Revolution brought forth the development of cylinder presses, powered by steam or mechanized systems. These presses could print thousands of pages per hour, marking a substantial leap in production capabilities.

=== Offset Lithography ===
In the late 19th century, the introduction of offset lithography revolutionized the printing industry. This technique used a flat metal plate with an image to transfer ink to a rubber blanket, which, in turn, printed the image onto the paper. Offset lithography offered more efficient and cost-effective printing, enabling high-quality reproductions and color printing on a large scale.

== Types ==
Printers can include:

*Newspaper printers, often owned by newspaper publishers
*Magazine printers, usually independent of magazine publishers
*Book printers, often not directly connected with book publishers
*Postcard printers
*Stationery printers
*Packaging printers
*Trade printers, who offer wholesale rates within the printing industry
*Wide-format printers, who specialize in wide format prints, such as signs and banners
*Printmakers, artists who create their artworks using printing
