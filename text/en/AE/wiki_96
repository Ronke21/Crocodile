<text>Proteins are large biomolecules and macromolecules that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity.

A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; but in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Some proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.

Once formed, proteins only exist for a certain period and are then degraded and recycled by the cell&#x27;s machinery through the process of protein turnover. A protein&#x27;s lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.

Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Some proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle, and the cytoskeleton&#x27;s scaffolding proteins that maintain cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. In animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. Digestion breaks the proteins down for metabolic use.

==History and etymology==

=== Discovery and early studies ===

Proteins have been studied and recognized since the 1700s by Antoine Fourcroy and others, who often collectively called them &quot;albumins&quot;, or &quot;albuminous materials&quot; (&quot;Eiweisskörper&quot;, in German). Gluten, for example, was first separated from wheat in published research around 1747, and later determined to exist in many plants. In 1789, Antoine Fourcroy recognized three distinct varieties of animal proteins: albumin, fibrin, and gelatin. Vegetable (plant) proteins studied in the late 1700s and early 1800s included gluten, plant albumin, gliadin, and legumin.

Proteins were first described by the Dutch chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder and named by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1838. Mulder carried out elemental analysis of common proteins and found that nearly all proteins had the same empirical formula, C400H620N100O120P1S1. He came to the erroneous conclusion that they might be composed of a single type of (very large) molecule. The term &quot;protein&quot; to describe these molecules was proposed by Mulder&#x27;s associate Berzelius; protein is derived from the Greek word (), meaning &quot;primary&quot;, &quot;in the lead&quot;, or &quot;standing in front&quot;, + &quot;&quot;. Mulder went on to identify the products of protein degradation such as the amino acid leucine for which he found a (nearly correct) molecular weight of 131 Da.

Early nutritional scientists such as the German Carl von Voit believed that protein was the most important nutrient for maintaining the structure of the body, because it was generally believed that &quot;flesh makes flesh.&quot; Around 1862, Karl Heinrich Ritthausen isolated the amino acid glutamic acid. Thomas Burr Osborne compiled a detailed review of the vegetable proteins at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Osborne, alongside Lafayette Mendel, established several nutritionally essential amino acids in feeding experiments with laboratory rats. Diets lacking an essential amino acid stunts the rats&#x27; growth, consistent with Liebig&#x27;s law of the minimum. The final essential amino acid to be discovered, threonine, was identified by William Cumming Rose.

The difficulty in purifying proteins impeded work by early protein biochemists. Proteins could be obtained in large quantities from blood, egg whites, and keratin, but individual proteins were unavailable. In the 1950s, the Armour Hot Dog Company purified 1 kg of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A and made it freely available to scientists. This gesture helped ribonuclease A become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades.

=== Polypeptides ===

The understanding of proteins as polypeptides, or chains of amino acids, came through the work of Franz Hofmeister and Hermann Emil Fischer in 1902. The central role of proteins as enzymes in living organisms that catalyzed reactions was not fully appreciated until 1926, when James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was in fact a protein.

Linus Pauling is credited with the successful prediction of regular protein secondary structures based on hydrogen bonding, an idea first put forth by William Astbury in 1933. Later work by Walter Kauzmann on denaturation, based partly on previous studies by Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang, contributed an understanding of protein folding and structure mediated by hydrophobic interactions.

The first protein to have its amino acid chain sequenced was insulin, by Frederick Sanger, in 1949. Sanger correctly determined the amino acid sequence of insulin, thus conclusively demonstrating that proteins consisted of linear polymers of amino acids rather than branched chains, colloids, or cyclols. He won the Nobel Prize for this achievement in 1958. Christian Anfinsen&#x27;s studies of the oxidative folding process of ribonuclease A, for which he won the nobel prize in 1972, solidified the thermodynamic hypothesis of protein folding, according to which the folded form of a protein represents its free energy minimum.

=== Structure ===

With the development of X-ray crystallography, it became possible to determine protein structures as well as their sequences. The first protein structures to be solved were hemoglobin by Max Perutz and myoglobin by John Kendrew, in 1958. The use of computers and increasing computing power has supported the sequencing of complex proteins. In 1999, Roger Kornberg sequenced the highly complex structure of RNA polymerase using high intensity X-rays from synchrotrons.

Since then, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of large macromolecular assemblies has been developed. Cryo-EM uses protein samples that are frozen rather than crystals, and beams of electrons rather than X-rays. It causes less damage to the sample, allowing scientists to obtain more information and analyze larger structures. Computational protein structure prediction of small protein structural domains has helped researchers to approach atomic-level resolution of protein structures.
, the Protein Data Bank contains 181,018 X-ray, 19,809 EM and 12,697 NMR protein structures.

== Classification ==

Proteins are primarily classified by sequence and structure, although other classifications are commonly used. Especially for enzymes the EC number system provides a functional classification scheme. Similarly, gene ontology classifies both genes and proteins by their biological and biochemical function, and by their intracellular location.

Sequence similarity is used to classify proteins both in terms of evolutionary and functional similarity. This may use either whole proteins or protein domains, especially in multi-domain proteins. Protein domains allow protein classification by a combination of sequence, structure and function, and they can be combined in many ways. In an early study of 170,000 proteins, about two-thirds were assigned at least one domain, with larger proteins containing more domains (e.g. proteins larger than 600 amino acids having an average of more than 5 domains).

== Biochemistry ==


Most proteins consist of linear polymers built from series of up to 20 -α-amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids have a common structure where an α-carbon is bonded to an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain. Only proline differs from this basic structure as its side chain is cyclical, bonding to the amino group, limiting protein chain flexibility. The side chains of the standard amino acids have a variety of chemical structures and properties, and it is the combined effect of all amino acids that determines its three-dimensional structure and chemical reactivity.

The amino acids in a polypeptide chain are linked by peptide bonds between amino and carboxyl group. An individual amino acid in a chain is called a &quot;residue,&quot; and the linked series of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are known as the &quot;main chain&quot; or &quot;protein backbone.&quot; The peptide bond has two resonance forms that confer some double-bond character to the backbone. The alpha carbons are roughly coplanar with the nitrogen and the carbonyl (C=O) group. The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. One conseqence of the N-C(O) double bond character is that proteins are somewhat rigid. A polypeptide chain ends with a free amino group, known as the &quot;N-terminus&quot; or &quot;amino terminus,&quot; and a free carboxyl group, known as the &quot;C-terminus&quot; or &quot;carboxy terminus&quot;. By convention, peptide sequences are written N-terminus to C-terminus, correlating with the order in which proteins are synthesized by ribosomes.

The words &quot;protein&quot;, &quot;polypeptide,&quot; and &quot;peptide&quot; are a little ambiguous and can overlap in meaning. &quot;Protein&quot; is generally used to refer to the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation, whereas &quot;peptide&quot; is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable 3D structure. But the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues.

Proteins can interact with many types of molecules and ions, including with other proteins, with lipids, with carbohydrates, and with DNA.

=== Abundance in cells ===

A typical bacterial cell, e.g. &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, is estimated to contain about 2 million proteins. Smaller bacteria, such as &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; or &quot;spirochetes&quot; contain fewer molecules, on the order of 50,000 to 1 million. By contrast, eukaryotic cells are larger and thus contain much more protein. For instance, yeast cells have been estimated to contain about 50 million proteins and human cells on the order of 1 to 3 billion. The concentration of individual protein copies ranges from a few molecules per cell up to 20 million. Not all genes coding proteins are expressed in most cells and their number depends on, for example, cell type and external stimuli. For instance, of the 20,000 or so proteins encoded by the human genome, only 6,000 are detected in lymphoblastoid cells. The most abundant protein in nature is thought to be RuBisCO, an enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of carbon dioxide into organic matter in photosynthesis. Plants can consist of as much as 1% by weight of this enzyme,

==Synthesis==

===Biosynthesis===


Proteins are assembled from amino acids using information encoded in genes. Each protein has its own unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code is a set of three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine–uracil–guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (a &quot;primary transcript&quot;) using various forms of post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.

The process of synthesizing a protein from an mRNA template is known as translation. The mRNA is loaded onto the ribosome and is read three nucleotides at a time by matching each codon to its base pairing anticodon located on a transfer RNA molecule, which carries the amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes. The enzyme aminoacyl tRNA synthetase &quot;charges&quot; the tRNA molecules with the correct amino acids. The growing polypeptide is often termed the &quot;nascent chain&quot;. Proteins are always biosynthesized from N-terminus to C-terminus.

The size of a synthesized protein can be measured by the number of amino acids it contains and by its total molecular mass, which is normally reported in units of &quot;daltons&quot; (synonymous with atomic mass units), or the derivative unit kilodalton (kDa). The average size of a protein increases from Archaea to Bacteria to Eukaryote (283, 311, 438 residues and 31, 34, 49 kDa respectively) due to a bigger number of protein domains constituting proteins in higher organisms. For instance, yeast proteins are on average 466 amino acids long and 53 kDa in mass. The largest known proteins are the titins, a component of the muscle sarcomere, with a molecular mass of almost 3,000 kDa and a total length of almost 27,000 amino acids.

===Chemical synthesis===

Short proteins can be synthesized chemically by a family of peptide synthesis methods. These rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce peptides in high yield. Chemical synthesis allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids into polypeptide chains, such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains. These methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology, though generally not for commercial applications. Chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids, and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure. Most chemical synthesis methods proceed from C-terminus to N-terminus, opposite the biological reaction.

== Structure ==


Most proteins fold into unique 3D structures. The shape into which a protein naturally folds is known as its native conformation. Although many proteins can fold unassisted, simply through the chemical properties of their amino acids, others require the aid of molecular chaperones to fold into their native states. Biochemists often refer to four distinct aspects of a protein&#x27;s structure:

* &quot;Primary structure&quot;: the amino acid sequence. A protein is a polyamide.
* &quot;Secondary structure&quot;: regularly repeating local structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds. The most common examples are the α-helix, β-sheet and turns. Because secondary structures are local, many regions of distinct secondary structure can be present in the same protein molecule.
* &quot;Tertiary structure&quot;: the overall shape of a single protein molecule; the spatial relationship of the secondary structures to one another. Tertiary structure is generally stabilized by nonlocal interactions, most commonly the formation of a hydrophobic core, but also through salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds, and even post-translational modifications. The term &quot;tertiary structure&quot; is often used as synonymous with the term &quot;fold&quot;. The tertiary structure is what controls the basic function of the protein.
* &quot;Quaternary structure&quot;: the structure formed by several protein molecules (polypeptide chains), usually called &quot;protein subunits&quot; in this context, which function as a single protein complex.
* &quot;Quinary structure&quot;: the signatures of protein surface that organize the crowded cellular interior. Quinary structure is dependent on transient, yet essential, macromolecular interactions that occur inside living cells.

Proteins are not entirely rigid molecules. In addition to these levels of structure, proteins may shift between several related structures while they perform their functions. In the context of these functional rearrangements, these tertiary or quaternary structures are usually referred to as &quot;conformations&quot;, and transitions between them are called &quot;conformational changes.&quot; Such changes are often induced by the binding of a substrate molecule to an enzyme&#x27;s active site, or the physical region of the protein that participates in chemical catalysis. In solution, protein structures vary because of thermal vibration and collisions with other molecules.

Proteins can be informally divided into three main classes, which correlate with typical tertiary structures: globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and membrane proteins. Almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes. Fibrous proteins are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or keratin, the protein component of hair and nails. Membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane.

A special case of intramolecular hydrogen bonds within proteins, poorly shielded from water attack and hence promoting their own dehydration, are called dehydrons.

=== Protein domains ===

Many proteins are composed of several protein domains, i.e. segments of a protein that fold into distinct structural units. Domains usually have specific functions, such as enzymatic activities (e.g. kinase) or they serve as binding modules.

=== Sequence motif ===
Short amino acid sequences within proteins often act as recognition sites for other proteins. For instance, SH3 domains typically bind to short PxxP motifs (i.e. 2 prolines [P], separated by two unspecified amino acids [x], although the surrounding amino acids may determine the exact binding specificity). Many such motifs has been collected in the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) database.

==Cellular functions==

Proteins are the chief actors within the cell, said to be carrying out the duties specified by the information encoded in genes. With the exception of certain types of RNA, most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act. Proteins make up half the dry weight of an &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; cell, whereas other macromolecules such as DNA and RNA make up only 3% and 20%, respectively. The set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its proteome.

The chief characteristic of proteins that allows their diverse set of functions is their ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly. The region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule is known as the binding site and is often a depression or &quot;pocket&quot; on the molecular surface. This binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein, which defines the binding site pocket, and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids&#x27; side chains. Protein binding can be extraordinarily tight and specific; for example, the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds to human angiogenin with a sub-femtomolar dissociation constant (&lt;10−15 M) but does not bind at all to its amphibian homolog onconase (&gt; 1 M). Extremely minor chemical changes such as the addition of a single methyl group to a binding partner can sometimes suffice to nearly eliminate binding; for example, the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase specific to the amino acid valine discriminates against the very similar side chain of the amino acid isoleucine.

Proteins can bind to other proteins as well as to small-molecule substrates. When proteins bind specifically to other copies of the same molecule, they can oligomerize to form fibrils; this process occurs often in structural proteins that consist of globular monomers that self-associate to form rigid fibers. Protein–protein interactions regulate enzymatic activity, control progression through the cell cycle, and allow the assembly of large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with a common biological function. Proteins can bind to, or be integrated into, cell membranes. The ability of binding partners to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the construction of enormously complex signaling networks.
As interactions between proteins are reversible and depend heavily on the availability of different groups of partner proteins to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function, study of the interactions between specific proteins is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types.

===Enzymes===

The best-known role of proteins in the cell is as enzymes, which catalyse chemical reactions. Enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only one or a few chemical reactions. Enzymes carry out most of the reactions involved in metabolism, as well as manipulating DNA in processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription. Some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification. About 4,000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes. The rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous—as much as 1017-fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase (78 million years without the enzyme, 18 milliseconds with the enzyme).

The molecules bound and acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist of hundreds of amino acids, it is usually only a small fraction of the residues that come in contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction—three to four residues on average—that are directly involved in catalysis. The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.

Dirigent proteins are members of a class of proteins that dictate the stereochemistry of a compound synthesized by other enzymes.

===Cell signaling and ligand binding===

Many proteins are involved in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction. Some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues. Others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell. Many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell, which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell.

Antibodies are protein components of an adaptive immune system whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody&#x27;s binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.

Many ligand transport proteins bind particular small biomolecules and transport them to other locations in the body of a multicellular organism. These proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations, and release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues. The canonical example of a ligand-binding protein is haemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties. Lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. Receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins.

Transmembrane proteins can serve as ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability of the cell membrane to small molecules and ions. The membrane alone has a hydrophobic core through which polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse. Membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules to enter and exit the cell. Many ion channel proteins are specialized to select for only a particular ion; for example, potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for only one of the two ions.

===Structural proteins===

Structural proteins confer stiffness and rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin is found in hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers that make up the cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.

Other proteins that serve structural functions are motor proteins such as myosin, kinesin, and dynein, which are capable of generating mechanical forces. These proteins are crucial for cellular motility of single celled organisms and the sperm of many multicellular organisms which reproduce sexually. They generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles and play essential roles in intracellular transport.

==Methods of study==

Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The activities and structures of proteins may be examined &quot;in vitro,&quot; &quot;in vivo, and in silico&quot;. In vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function: for example, enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme&#x27;s catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules. By contrast, in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein in the context of a cell or even a whole organism, and can often provide more information about protein behavior in different contexts. In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins.

===Protein purification===

Proteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification.

To perform &quot;in vitro&quot; analysis, a protein must be purified away from other cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell&#x27;s membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein&#x27;s molecular weight and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity. Additionally, proteins can be isolated according to their charge using electrofocusing.

For natural proteins, a series of purification steps may be necessary to obtain protein sufficiently pure for laboratory applications. To simplify this process, genetic engineering is often used to add chemical features to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity. Here, a &quot;tag&quot; consisting of a specific amino acid sequence, often a series of histidine residues (a &quot;His-tag&quot;), is attached to one terminus of the protein. As a result, when the lysate is passed over a chromatography column containing nickel, the histidine residues ligate the nickel and attach to the column while the untagged components of the lysate pass unimpeded. A number of tags have been developed to help researchers purify specific proteins from complex mixtures.

===Cellular localization===

The study of proteins &quot;in vivo&quot; is often concerned with the synthesis and localization of the protein within the cell. Although many intracellular proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and membrane-bound or secreted proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, the specifics of how proteins are targeted to specific organelles or cellular structures is often unclear. A useful technique for assessing cellular localization uses genetic engineering to express in a cell a fusion protein or chimera consisting of the natural protein of interest linked to a &quot;reporter&quot; such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). The fused protein&#x27;s position within the cell can then be cleanly and efficiently visualized using microscopy.

Other methods for elucidating the cellular location of proteins requires the use of known compartmental markers for regions such as the ER, the Golgi, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, etc. With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers, it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest. For example, indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location. Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose.

Other possibilities exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually uses an antibody to one or more proteins of interest that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it indicates an increased likelihood.

Finally, the gold-standard method of cellular localization is immunoelectron microscopy. This technique uses an antibody to the protein of interest, along with classical electron microscopy techniques. The sample is prepared for normal electron microscopic examination, and then treated with an antibody to the protein of interest that is conjugated to an extremely electro-dense material, usually gold. This allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details as well as the protein of interest.

Through another genetic engineering application known as site-directed mutagenesis, researchers can alter the protein sequence and hence its structure, cellular localization, and susceptibility to regulation. This technique even allows the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, using modified tRNAs, and may allow the rational design of new proteins with novel properties.

===Proteomics===

The total complement of proteins present at a time in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by analogy to the related field of genomics. Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis, which allows the separation of many proteins, mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of the various proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. The total complement of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.

===Structure determination===

Discovering the tertiary structure of a protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function and how it can be affected, i.e. in drug design. As proteins are too small to be seen under a light microscope, other methods have to be employed to determine their structure. Common experimental methods include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can produce structural information at atomic resolution. However, NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. Dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β-sheet / α-helical composition of proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information about very large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained in the form of Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein.

Many more gene sequences are known than protein structures. Further, the set of solved structures is biased toward proteins that can be easily subjected to the conditions required in X-ray crystallography, one of the major structure determination methods. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography. Membrane proteins and large protein complexes, by contrast, are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the PDB. Structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. Protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.

===Structure prediction===

Complementary to the field of structural genomics, &quot;protein structure prediction&quot; develops efficient mathematical models of proteins to computationally predict the molecular formations in theory, instead of detecting structures with laboratory observation. The most successful type of structure prediction, known as homology modeling, relies on the existence of a &quot;template&quot; structure with sequence similarity to the protein being modeled; structural genomics&#x27; goal is to provide sufficient representation in solved structures to model most of those that remain. Although producing accurate models remains a challenge when only distantly related template structures are available, it has been suggested that sequence alignment is the bottleneck in this process, as quite accurate models can be produced if a &quot;perfect&quot; sequence alignment is known. Many structure prediction methods have served to inform the emerging field of protein engineering, in which novel protein folds have already been designed. Many proteins (in eukaryotes ~33%) contain large unstructured but biologically functional segments and can be classified as intrinsically disordered proteins. Predicting and analysing protein disorder is an important part of protein structure characterisation.

===In silico simulation of dynamical processes===

A more complex computational problem is the prediction of intermolecular interactions, such as in molecular docking, protein folding, protein–protein interaction and chemical reactivity. Mathematical models to simulate these dynamical processes involve molecular mechanics, in particular, molecular dynamics. In this regard, &quot;in silico&quot; simulations discovered the folding of small α-helical protein domains such as the villin headpiece, the HIV accessory protein and hybrid methods combining standard molecular dynamics with quantum mechanical mathematics have explored the electronic states of rhodopsins.

Beyond classical molecular dynamics, quantum dynamics methods allow the simulation of proteins in atomistic detail with an accurate description of quantum mechanical effects. Examples include the multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree  method and the hierarchical equations of motion approach, which have been applied to plant cryptochromes and bacteria light-harvesting complexes, respectively. Both quantum and classical mechanical simulations of biological-scale systems are extremely computationally demanding, so distributed computing initiatives such as the Folding@home project facilitate the molecular modeling by exploiting advances in GPU parallel processing and Monte Carlo techniques.

===Chemical analysis===

The total nitrogen content of organic matter is mainly formed by the amino groups in proteins. The Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) is a measure of nitrogen widely used in the analysis of (waste) water, soil, food, feed and organic matter in general. As the name suggests, the Kjeldahl method is applied. More sensitive methods are available.

==Digestion==

In the absence of catalysts, proteins are slow to hydrolyze. The breakdown of proteins to small peptides and amino acids (proteolysis) is a step in digestion; these breakdown products are then absorbed in the small intestine. The hydrolysis of proteins relies on enzymes called proteases or peptidases. Proteases, which are themselves proteins, come in several types according to the particular peptide bonds that they cleave as well as their tendency to cleave peptide bonds at the terminus of a protein (exopeptidases) vs peptide bonds at the interior of the protein (endopeptidases). Pepsin is an endopeptidase in the stomach. Subsequent to the stomach, the pancreas secretes other proteases to complete the hydrolysis, these include trypsin and chymotrypsin.

Protein hydrolysis is employed commercially as a means of producing amino acids from bulk sources of protein, such as blood meal, feathers, keratin. Such materials are treated with hot hydrochloric acid, which effects the hydrolysis of the peptide bonds.

== Mechanical properties ==

The mechanical properties of proteins are highly diverse and are often central to their biological function, as in the case of proteins like keratin and collagen. For instance, the ability of muscle tissue to continually expand and contract is directly tied to the elastic properties of their underlying protein makeup. Beyond fibrous proteins, the conformational dynamics of enzymes and the structure of biological membranes, among other biological functions, are governed by the mechanical properties of the proteins. Outside of their biological context, the unique mechanical properties of many proteins, along with their relative sustainability when compared to synthetic polymers, have made them desirable targets for next-generation materials design.

Young&#x27;s modulus, &quot;E,&quot; is calculated as the axial stress σ over the resulting strain ε. It is a measure of the relative stiffness of a material. In the context of proteins, this stiffness often directly correlates to biological function. For example, collagen, found in connective tissue, bones, and cartilage, and keratin, found in nails, claws, and hair, have observed stiffnesses that are several orders of magnitude higher than that of elastin, which is though to give elasticity to structures such as blood vessels, pulmonary tissue, and bladder tissue, among others. In comparison to this, globular proteins, such as Bovine Serum Albumin, which float relatively freely in the cytosol and often function as enzymes (and thus undergoing frequent conformational changes) have comparably much lower Young&#x27;s moduli.

The Young&#x27;s modulus of a single protein can be found through molecular dynamics simulation. Using either atomistic force-fields, such as CHARMM or GROMOS, or coarse-grained forcefields like Martini, a single protein molecule can be stretched by a uniaxial force while the resulting extension is recorded in order to calculate the strain. Experimentally, methods such as atomic force microscopy can be used to obtain similar data.

At the macroscopic level, the Young&#x27;s modulus of cross-linked protein networks can be obtained through more traditional mechanical testing. Experimentally observed values for a few proteins can be seen below.

<text>Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic and microscopic phenomena in chemical systems in terms of the principles, practices, and concepts of physics such as motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, analytical dynamics and chemical equilibria.

Physical chemistry, in contrast to chemical physics, is predominantly (but not always) a supra-molecular science, as the majority of the principles on which it was founded relate to the bulk rather than the molecular or atomic structure alone (for example, chemical equilibrium and colloids).

Some of the relationships that physical chemistry strives to understand include the effects of:
# Intermolecular forces that act upon the physical properties of materials (plasticity, tensile strength, surface tension in liquids).
# Reaction kinetics on the rate of a reaction.
# The identity of ions and the electrical conductivity of materials.
# Surface science and electrochemistry of cell membranes.
# Interaction of one body with another in terms of quantities of heat and work called thermodynamics.
# Transfer of heat between a chemical system and its surroundings during change of phase or chemical reaction taking place called thermochemistry
# Study of colligative properties of number of species present in solution.
# Number of phases, number of components and degree of freedom (or variance) can be correlated with one another with help of phase rule.
# Reactions of electrochemical cells.
# Behaviour of microscopic systems using quantum mechanics and macroscopic systems using statistical thermodynamics.
# Calculation of the energy of electron movement in molecules and metal complexes.

== Key concepts ==
The key concepts of physical chemistry are the ways in which pure physics is applied to chemical problems.

One of the key concepts in classical chemistry is that all chemical compounds can be described as groups of atoms bonded together and chemical reactions can be described as the making and breaking of those bonds. Predicting the properties of chemical compounds from a description of atoms and how they bond is one of the major goals of physical chemistry. To describe the atoms and bonds precisely, it is necessary to know both where the nuclei of the atoms are, and how electrons are distributed around them.

== Disciplines ==
Quantum chemistry, a subfield of physical chemistry especially concerned with the application of quantum mechanics to chemical problems, provides tools to determine how strong and what shape bonds are, how nuclei move, and how light can be absorbed or emitted by a chemical compound. Spectroscopy is the related sub-discipline of physical chemistry which is specifically concerned with the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter.

Another set of important questions in chemistry concerns what kind of reactions can happen spontaneously and which properties are possible for a given chemical mixture. This is studied in chemical thermodynamics, which sets limits on quantities like how far a reaction can proceed, or how much energy can be converted into work in an internal combustion engine, and which provides links between properties like the thermal expansion coefficient and rate of change of entropy with pressure for a gas or a liquid. It can frequently be used to assess whether a reactor or engine design is feasible, or to check the validity of experimental data. To a limited extent, quasi-equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics can describe irreversible changes. However, classical thermodynamics is mostly concerned with systems in equilibrium and reversible changes and not what actually does happen, or how fast, away from equilibrium.

Which reactions do occur and how fast is the subject of chemical kinetics, another branch of physical chemistry. A key idea in chemical kinetics is that for reactants to react and form products, most chemical species must go through transition states which are higher in energy than either the reactants or the products and serve as a barrier to reaction. In general, the higher the barrier, the slower the reaction. A second is that most chemical reactions occur as a sequence of elementary reactions, each with its own transition state. Key questions in kinetics include how the rate of reaction depends on temperature and on the concentrations of reactants and catalysts in the reaction mixture, as well as how catalysts and reaction conditions can be engineered to optimize the reaction rate.

The fact that how fast reactions occur can often be specified with just a few concentrations and a temperature, instead of needing to know all the positions and speeds of every molecule in a mixture, is a special case of another key concept in physical chemistry, which is that to the extent an engineer needs to know, everything going on in a mixture of very large numbers (perhaps of the order of the Avogadro constant, 6 x 1023) of particles can often be described by just a few variables like pressure, temperature, and concentration. The precise reasons for this are described in statistical mechanics, a specialty within physical chemistry which is also shared with physics. Statistical mechanics also provides ways to predict the properties we see in everyday life from molecular properties without relying on empirical correlations based on chemical similarities.

== History ==
The term &quot;physical chemistry&quot; was coined by Mikhail Lomonosov in 1752, when he presented a lecture course entitled &quot;A Course in True Physical Chemistry&quot; () before the students of Petersburg University. In the preamble to these lectures he gives the definition: &quot;Physical chemistry is the science that must explain under provisions of physical experiments the reason for what is happening in complex bodies through chemical operations&quot;.

Modern physical chemistry originated in the 1860s to 1880s with work on chemical thermodynamics, electrolytes in solutions, chemical kinetics and other subjects. One milestone was the publication in 1876 by Josiah Willard Gibbs of his paper, &quot;On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances&quot;. This paper introduced several of the cornerstones of physical chemistry, such as Gibbs energy, chemical potentials, and Gibbs&#x27; phase rule.

The first scientific journal specifically in the field of physical chemistry was the German journal, &quot;Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie&quot;, founded in 1887 by Wilhelm Ostwald and Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff. Together with Svante August Arrhenius, these were the leading figures in physical chemistry in the late 19th century and early 20th century. All three were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry between 1901 and 1909.

Developments in the following decades include the application of statistical mechanics to chemical systems and work on colloids and surface chemistry, where Irving Langmuir made many contributions. Another important step was the development of quantum mechanics into quantum chemistry from the 1930s, where Linus Pauling was one of the leading names. Theoretical developments have gone hand in hand with developments in experimental methods, where the use of different forms of spectroscopy, such as infrared spectroscopy, microwave spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, is probably the most important 20th century development.

Further development in physical chemistry may be attributed to discoveries in nuclear chemistry, especially in isotope separation (before and during World War II), more recent discoveries in astrochemistry, as well as the development of calculation algorithms in the field of &quot;additive physicochemical properties&quot; (practically all physicochemical properties, such as boiling point, critical point, surface tension, vapor pressure, etc.—more than 20 in all—can be precisely calculated from chemical structure alone, even if the chemical molecule remains unsynthesized), and herein lies the practical importance of contemporary physical chemistry.

<text>A perimeter is a closed path that encompasses, surrounds, or outlines either a two dimensional shape or a one-dimensional length. The perimeter of a circle or an ellipse is called its circumference.

Calculating the perimeter has several practical applications. A calculated perimeter is the length of fence required to surround a yard or garden. The perimeter of a wheel/circle (its circumference) describes how far it will roll in one revolution. Similarly, the amount of string wound around a spool is related to the spool&#x27;s perimeter; if the length of the string was exact, it would equal the perimeter.

== Formulas ==
The perimeter is the distance around a shape. Perimeters for more general shapes can be calculated, as any path, with formula_1, where formula_2 is the length of the path and formula_3 is an infinitesimal line element. Both of these must be replaced by algebraic forms in order to be practically calculated. If the perimeter is given as a closed piecewise smooth plane curve formula_4 with
:formula_5 
then its length formula_2 can be computed as follows:
: formula_7

A generalized notion of perimeter, which includes hypersurfaces bounding volumes in formula_8-dimensional Euclidean spaces, is described by the theory of Caccioppoli sets.

==Polygons==

Polygons are fundamental to determining perimeters, not only because they are the simplest shapes but also because the perimeters of many shapes are calculated by approximating them with sequences of polygons tending to these shapes. The first mathematician known to have used this kind of reasoning is Archimedes, who approximated the perimeter of a circle by surrounding it with regular polygons.

The perimeter of a polygon equals the sum of the lengths of its sides (edges). In particular, the perimeter of a rectangle of width formula_9 and length formula_10 equals formula_11

An equilateral polygon is a polygon which has all sides of the same length (for example, a rhombus is a 4-sided equilateral polygon). To calculate the perimeter of an equilateral polygon, one must multiply the common length of the sides by the number of sides.

A regular polygon may be characterized by the number of its sides and by its circumradius, that is to say, the constant distance between its centre and each of its vertices. The length of its sides can be calculated using trigonometry. If is a regular polygon&#x27;s radius and is the number of its sides, then its perimeter is 
:formula_12

A splitter of a triangle is a cevian (a segment from a vertex to the opposite side) that divides the perimeter into two equal lengths, this common length being called the semiperimeter of the triangle. The three splitters of a triangle all intersect each other at the Nagel point of the triangle.

A cleaver of a triangle is a segment from the midpoint of a side of a triangle to the opposite side such that the perimeter is divided into two equal lengths. The three cleavers of a triangle all intersect each other at the triangle&#x27;s Spieker center.

==Circumference of a circle==
The perimeter of a circle, often called the circumference, is proportional to its diameter and its radius. That is to say, there exists a constant number pi, (the Greek &quot;p&quot; for perimeter), such that if is the circle&#x27;s perimeter and its diameter then,
:formula_13

In terms of the radius of the circle, this formula becomes,

:formula_14

To calculate a circle&#x27;s perimeter, knowledge of its radius or diameter and the number suffices. The problem is that is not rational (it cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers), nor is it algebraic (it is not a root of a polynomial equation with rational coefficients). So, obtaining an accurate approximation of is important in the calculation. The computation of the digits of is relevant to many fields, such as mathematical analysis, algorithmics and computer science.

== Perception of perimeter==
The perimeter and the area are two main measures of geometric figures. Confusing them is a common error, as well as believing that the greater one of them is, the greater the other must be. Indeed, a commonplace observation is that an enlargement (or a reduction) of a shape make its area grow (or decrease) as well as its perimeter. For example, if a field is drawn on a 1/ scale map, the actual field perimeter can be calculated multiplying the drawing perimeter by . The real area is times the area of the shape on the map. Nevertheless, there is no relation between the area and the perimeter of an ordinary shape. For example, the perimeter of a rectangle of width 0.001 and length 1000 is slightly above 2000, while the perimeter of a rectangle of width 0.5 and length 2 is 5. Both areas are equal to 1.

Proclus (5th century) reported that Greek peasants &quot;fairly&quot; parted fields relying on their perimeters. However, a field&#x27;s production is proportional to its area, not to its perimeter, so many naive peasants may have gotten fields with long perimeters but small areas (thus, few crops).

If one removes a piece from a figure, its area decreases but its perimeter may not. The convex hull of a figure may be visualized as the shape formed by a rubber band stretched around it. In the animated picture on the left, all the figures have the same convex hull; the big, first hexagon.

== Isoperimetry ==
The isoperimetric problem is to determine a figure with the largest area, amongst those having a given perimeter. The solution is intuitive; it is the circle. In particular, this can be used to explain why drops of fat on a broth surface are circular.

This problem may seem simple, but its mathematical proof requires some sophisticated theorems. The isoperimetric problem is sometimes simplified by restricting the type of figures to be used. In particular, to find the quadrilateral, or the triangle, or another particular figure, with the largest area amongst those with the same shape having a given perimeter. The solution to the quadrilateral isoperimetric problem is the square, and the solution to the triangle problem is the equilateral triangle. In general, the polygon with sides having the largest area and a given perimeter is the regular polygon, which is closer to being a circle than is any irregular polygon with the same number of sides.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Greek περίμετρος &quot;perimetros&quot;, from περί &quot;peri&quot; &quot;around&quot; and μέτρον &quot;metron&quot; &quot;measure&quot;.

<text>In the physical sciences, a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform, physically distinct, and (often) mechanically separable. In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar, the ice cubes are one phase, the water is a second phase, and the humid air is a third phase over the ice and water. The glass of the jar is a different material, in its own separate phase. (See .)

More precisely, a phase is a region of space (a thermodynamic system), throughout which all physical properties of a material are essentially uniform. Examples of physical properties include density, index of refraction, magnetization and chemical composition.

The term &quot;phase&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but there can be several immiscible phases of the same state of matter (as where oil and water separate into distinct phases, both in the liquid state). It is also sometimes used to refer to the equilibrium states shown on a phase diagram, described in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature and demarcated by phase boundaries. (Phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter, including for example a subtle change within the solid state from one crystal structure to another, as well as state-changes such as between solid and liquid.) These two usages are not with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from the context in which the term is used.

== Types of phases ==

Distinct phases may be described as different states of matter such as gas, liquid, solid, plasma or Bose–Einstein condensate. Useful mesophases between solid and liquid form other states of matter.

Distinct phases may also exist within a given state of matter. As shown in the diagram for iron alloys, several phases exist for both the solid and liquid states. Phases may also be differentiated based on solubility as in polar (hydrophilic) or non-polar (hydrophobic). A mixture of water (a polar liquid) and oil (a non-polar liquid) will spontaneously separate into two phases. Water has a very low solubility (is insoluble) in oil, and oil has a low solubility in water. Solubility is the maximum amount of a solute that can dissolve in a solvent before the solute ceases to dissolve and remains in a separate phase. A mixture can separate into more than two liquid phases and the concept of phase separation extends to solids, i.e., solids can form solid solutions or crystallize into distinct crystal phases. Metal pairs that are mutually soluble can form alloys, whereas metal pairs that are mutually insoluble cannot.

As many as eight immiscible liquid phases have been observed. Mutually immiscible liquid phases are formed from water (aqueous phase), hydrophobic organic solvents, perfluorocarbons (fluorous phase), silicones, several different metals, and also from molten phosphorus. Not all organic solvents are completely miscible, e.g. a mixture of ethylene glycol and toluene may separate into two distinct organic phases.

Phases do not need to macroscopically separate spontaneously. Emulsions and colloids are examples of immiscible phase pair combinations that do not physically separate.
==Phase equilibrium==
Left to equilibration, many compositions will form a uniform single phase, but depending on the temperature and pressure even a single substance may separate into two or more distinct phases. Within each phase, the properties are uniform but between the two phases properties differ.

Water in a closed jar with an air space over it forms a two-phase system. Most of the water is in the liquid phase, where it is held by the mutual attraction of water molecules. Even at equilibrium molecules are constantly in motion and, once in a while, a molecule in the liquid phase gains enough kinetic energy to break away from the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. Likewise, every once in a while a vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid. At equilibrium, evaporation and condensation processes exactly balance and there is no net change in the volume of either phase.

At room temperature and pressure, the water jar reaches equilibrium when the air over the water has a humidity of about 3%. This percentage increases as the temperature goes up. At 100 °C and atmospheric pressure, equilibrium is not reached until the air is 100% water. If the liquid is heated a little over 100 °C, the transition from liquid to gas will occur not only at the surface but throughout the liquid volume: the water boils.

==Number of phases==
For a given composition, only certain phases are possible at a given temperature and pressure. The number and type of phases that will form is hard to predict and is usually determined by experiment. The results of such experiments can be plotted in phase diagrams.

The phase diagram shown here is for a single component system. In this simple system, phases that are possible, depend only on pressure and temperature. The markings show points where two or more phases can co-exist in equilibrium. At temperatures and pressures away from the markings, there will be only one phase at equilibrium.

In the diagram, the blue line marking the boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely, but terminates at a point called the critical point. As the temperature and pressure approach the critical point, the properties of the liquid and gas become progressively more similar. At the critical point, the liquid and gas become indistinguishable. Above the critical point, there are no longer separate liquid and gas phases: there is only a generic fluid phase referred to as a supercritical fluid. In water, the critical point occurs at around 647 K (374 °C or 705 °F) and 22.064 MPa.

An unusual feature of the water phase diagram is that the solid–liquid phase line (illustrated by the dotted green line) has a negative slope. For most substances, the slope is positive as exemplified by the dark green line. This unusual feature of water is related to ice having a lower density than liquid water. Increasing the pressure drives the water into the higher density phase, which causes melting.

Another interesting though not unusual feature of the phase diagram is the point where the solid–liquid phase line meets the liquid–gas phase line. The intersection is referred to as the triple point. At the triple point, all three phases can coexist.

Experimentally, phase lines are relatively easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases form. Gibbs&#x27; phase rule suggests that different phases are completely determined by these variables. Consider a test apparatus consisting of a closed and well-insulated cylinder equipped with a piston. By controlling the temperature and the pressure, the system can be brought to any point on the phase diagram. From a point in the solid stability region (left side of the diagram), increasing the temperature of the system would bring it into the region where a liquid or a gas is the equilibrium phase (depending on the pressure). If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of the water has condensed.

==Interfacial phenomena==

Between two phases in equilibrium there is a narrow region where the properties are not that of either phase. Although this region may be very thin, it can have significant and easily observable effects, such as causing a liquid to exhibit surface tension. In mixtures, some components may preferentially move toward the interface. In terms of modeling, describing, or understanding the behavior of a particular system, it may be efficacious to treat the interfacial region as a separate phase.

==Crystal phases==
A single material may have several distinct solid states capable of forming separate phases. Water is a well-known example of such a material. For example, water ice is ordinarily found in the hexagonal form ice Ih, but can also exist as the cubic ice Ic, the rhombohedral ice II, and many other forms. Polymorphism is the ability of a solid to exist in more than one crystal form. For pure chemical elements, polymorphism is known as allotropy. For example, diamond, graphite, and fullerenes are different allotropes of carbon.

==Phase transitions==

When a substance undergoes a phase transition (changes from one state of matter to another) it usually either takes up or releases energy. For example, when water evaporates, the increase in kinetic energy as the evaporating molecules escape the attractive forces of the liquid is reflected in a decrease in temperature. The energy required to induce the phase transition is taken from the internal thermal energy of the water, which cools the liquid to a lower temperature; hence evaporation is useful for cooling. See Enthalpy of vaporization. The reverse process, condensation, releases heat. The heat energy, or enthalpy, associated with a solid to liquid transition is the enthalpy of fusion and that associated with a solid to gas transition is the enthalpy of sublimation.

== Phases out of equilibrium ==
While phases of matter are traditionally defined for systems in thermal equilibrium, work on quantum many-body localized (MBL) systems has provided a framework for defining phases out of equilibrium. MBL phases never reach thermal equilibrium, and can allow for new forms of order disallowed in equilibrium via a phenomenon known as localization protected quantum order. The transitions between different MBL phases and between MBL and thermalizing phases are novel dynamical phase transitions whose properties are active areas of research.

<text>Physical science is a branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in contrast to life science. It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a &quot;physical science&quot;, together is called the &quot;physical sciences&quot;.

== Definition ==

Physical science can be described as all of the following:
* A branch of science (a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe).
* A branch of natural science – natural science is a major branch of science that tries to explain and predict nature&#x27;s phenomena, based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory. Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into two main branches: life science (for example biology) and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.
* A branch of applied science - the application of the scientific method and scientific knowledge to attain practical goals. It includes a broad range of disciplines, such as engineering and medicine., although medicine would not normally be considered a physical science. Applied science is often contrasted with basic science, which is focused on advancing scientific theories and laws that explain and predict natural or other phenomena.

== Branches ==
* Physics – natural and physical science could involve the study of matter and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves.
** Branches of physics
* Astronomy – study of celestial objects (such as stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets and nebulae), the physics, chemistry, and evolution of such objects, and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth, including supernovae explosions, gamma-ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation.
** Branches of astronomy
* Chemistry – studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. In this realm, chemistry deals with such topics as the properties of individual atoms, the manner in which atoms form chemical bonds in the formation of compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces to give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.
** Branches of chemistry
* Earth science – all-embracing term referring to the fields of science dealing with planet Earth. Earth science is the study of how the natural environment (ecosphere or Earth system) works and how it evolved to its current state. It includes the study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere.
* Materials science - an interdisciplinary field of researching and discovering materials. Materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material (&quot;processing&quot;) influences its structure, and also the material&#x27;s properties and performance. The understanding of processing structure properties relationships is called the materials paradigm. This paradigm is used for advanced understanding in a variety of research areas, including nanotechnology, biomaterials, and metallurgy.
* Computer science - the study of computation, information, and automation. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).

==General principles==
* Principle – law or rule that has to be, or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system&#x27;s designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.

===Basic principles of physics===
Physics – branch of science that studies matter and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. Physics is one of the &quot;fundamental sciences&quot; because the other natural sciences (like biology, geology, etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms, or subatomic particles). Some of the basic pursuits of physics, which include some of the most prominent developments in modern science in the last millennium, include:
* Describing the nature, measuring and quantifying of bodies and their motion, dynamics etc.
** Newton&#x27;s laws of motion
** Mass, force and weight
** Momentum and conservation of energy
** Gravity, theories of gravity
** Energy, work, and their relationship
** Motion, position, and energy
** Different forms of Energy, their interconversion and the inevitable loss of energy in the form of heat (Thermodynamics)
** Energy conservation, conversion, and transfer.
** Energy source the transfer of energy from one source to work in another.
* Kinetic molecular theory
** Phases of matter and phase transitions
** Temperature and thermometers
** Energy and heat
** Heat flow: conduction, convection, and radiation
** The four laws of thermodynamics
* The principles of waves and sound
* The principles of electricity, magnetism, and electromagnetism
* The principles, sources, and properties of light

===Basic principles of astronomy===
Astronomy – science of celestial bodies and their interactions in space. Its studies include the following:
* The life and characteristics of stars and galaxies
* Origins of the universe. Physical science uses the Big Bang theory as the commonly accepted scientific theory of the origin of the universe.
* A heliocentric Solar System. Ancient cultures saw the Earth as the centre of the Solar System or universe (geocentrism). In the 16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus advanced the ideas of heliocentrism, recognizing the Sun as the centre of the Solar System.
* The structure of solar systems, planets, comets, asteroids, and meteors
* The shape and structure of Earth (roughly spherical, see also Spherical Earth)
* Earth in the Solar System
* Time measurement
* The composition and features of the Moon
* Interactions of the Earth and Moon

(Note: Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, which assumes that people&#x27;s destiny and human affairs in general correlate to the apparent positions of astronomical objects in the sky – although the two fields share a common origin, they are quite different; astronomers embrace the scientific method, while astrologers do not.)

===Basic principles of chemistry===
Chemistry – branch of science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry is chiefly concerned with atoms and molecules and their interactions and transformations, for example, the properties of the chemical bonds formed between atoms to create chemical compounds. As such, chemistry studies the involvement of electrons and various forms of energy in photochemical reactions, oxidation-reduction reactions, changes in phases of matter, and separation of mixtures. Preparation and properties of complex substances, such as alloys, polymers, biological molecules, and pharmaceutical agents are considered in specialized fields of chemistry.

<doc id="23639" wikidata="Q39558" url="?curid=23639" title="Gasoline">
<text>Gasoline (North American English) or petrol (Commonwealth English) is a petrochemical product characterized as a transparent, yellowish, and flammable liquid normally used as a fuel for spark-ignited internal combustion engines. When formulated as a fuel for engines, gasoline is chemically composed of organic compounds derived from the fractional distillation of petroleum and later chemically enhanced with gasoline additives. It is a high-volume profitable product produced in crude oil refineries.

The fuel-characteristics of a particular gasoline-blend, which will resist igniting too early are measured as the octane rating of the fuel blend. Gasoline blends with stable octane ratings are produced in several fuel-grades for various types of motors. A low octane rated fuel may cause engine knocking and reduced efficiency in reciprocating engines. Tetraethyl lead was once widely used to increase the octane rating but is not used in modern automotive gasoline due to the health hazard. Aviation, off-road motor vehicles, and racing car motors still use leaded gasolines.

==History and etymology==

English dictionaries show that the term &quot;gasoline&quot; originates from &quot;gas&quot; plus the chemical suffixes &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. &quot;Petrol&quot; derives from the Medieval Latin word &quot;petroleum&quot; (L. &quot;petra&quot;, rock + &quot;oleum&quot;, oil).

Interest in gasoline-like fuels started with the invention of internal combustion engines suitable for use in transportation applications. The so-called Otto engines were developed in Germany during the last quarter of the 19th century. The fuel for these early engines was a relatively volatile hydrocarbon obtained from coal gas. With a boiling point near (&quot;n&quot;-octane boils at ), it was well suited for early carburetors (evaporators). The development of a &quot;spray nozzle&quot; carburetor enabled the use of less volatile fuels. Further improvements in engine efficiency were attempted at higher compression ratios, but early attempts were blocked by the premature explosion of fuel, known as knocking. In 1891, the Shukhov cracking process became the world&#x27;s first commercial method to break down heavier hydrocarbons in crude oil to increase the %age of lighter products compared to simple distillation.

==Chemical analysis and production==

Commercial gasoline as well as other liquid transportation fuels are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons. The performance specification also varies with season, requiring less volatile blends during summer, in order to minimize evaporative losses.

Gasoline is produced in oil refineries. Roughly of gasoline is derived from a barrel of crude oil. Material separated from crude oil via distillation, called virgin or straight-run gasoline, does not meet specifications for modern engines (particularly the octane rating; see below), but can be pooled to the gasoline blend.

The bulk of a typical gasoline consists of a homogeneous mixture of hydrocarbons with between four and twelve carbon atoms per molecule (commonly referred to as C4–C12). It is a mixture of paraffins (alkanes), olefins (alkenes), napthenes (cycloalkanes), and aromatics. The use of the term &quot;paraffin&quot; in place of the standard chemical nomenclature &quot;alkane&quot; is particular to the oil industry (which relies extensively on jargon). The composition of a gasoline depends upon:
* the oil refinery that makes the gasoline, as not all refineries have the same set of processing units;
* the crude oil feed used by the refinery;
* the grade of gasoline sought (in particular, the octane rating).

The various refinery streams blended to make gasoline have different characteristics. Some important streams include the following:
* Straight-run gasoline, sometimes referred to as &quot;naphtha (and also light straight run naphtha &quot;LSR&quot; and light virgin naphtha &quot;LVN&quot;)&quot;, is distilled directly from crude oil. Once the leading source of fuel, naphtha&#x27;s low octane rating required organometallic fuel additives (primarily tetraethyllead) prior to their phaseout from the gasoline pool which started in 1975 in the United States. Straight run naphtha is typically low in aromatics (depending on the grade of the crude oil stream) and contains some cycloalkanes (naphthenes) and no olefins (alkenes). Between 0 and 20 % of this stream is pooled into the finished gasoline because the quantity of this fraction in the crude is less than fuel demand and the fraction&#x27;s Research Octane Number (RON) is too low. The chemical properties (namely RON and Reid vapor pressure (RVP)) of the straight-run gasoline can be improved through reforming and isomerization. However, before feeding those units, the naphtha needs to be split into light and heavy naphtha. Straight-run gasoline can also be used as a feedstock for steam-crackers to produce olefins.
* Reformate, produced from straight run gasoline in a catalytic reformer, has a high octane rating with high aromatic content and relatively low olefin content. Most of the benzene, toluene, and xylene (the so-called BTX hydrocarbons) are more valuable as chemical feedstocks and are thus removed to some extent. Also the BTX content is regulated.
* Catalytic cracked gasoline, or catalytic cracked naphtha, produced with a catalytic cracker, has a moderate octane rating, high olefin content, and moderate aromatic content.
* Hydrocrackate (heavy, mid, and light), produced with a hydrocracker, has a medium to low octane rating and moderate aromatic levels.
* Alkylate is produced in an alkylation unit, using isobutane and C3-/C4-olefins as feedstocks. Finished alkylate contains no aromatics or olefins and has a high MON (Motor Octane Number) Alkylate was used during world war 2 in aviation fuel. Since the late 1980s, it is sold as a specialty fuel for (handheld) gardening and forestry tools with a combustion engine. 
* Isomerate is obtained by isomerizing low-octane straight-run gasoline into iso-paraffins (non-chain alkanes, such as isooctane). Isomerate has a medium RON and MON, but no aromatics or olefins.
* Butane is usually blended in the gasoline pool, although the quantity of this stream is limited by the RVP specification.
* Oxygenates (more specifically alcohols and esters) are mostly blended into the pool in the US as ethanol. In Europe and other countries, the blends can contain ethanol in addition to Methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and Ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE). MTBE in the United States was banned by most states in the early to mid 2000s. A few countries still allow methanol as well to be blended directly into gasoline, especially in China. More about oxygenates and blending is covered further in this article. 

The terms above are the jargon used in the oil industry, and the terminology varies.

Currently, many countries set limits on gasoline aromatics in general, benzene in particular, and olefin (alkene) content. Such regulations have led to an increasing preference for alkane isomers, such as isomerate or alkylate, as their octane rating is higher than n-alkanes. In the European Union, the benzene limit is set at one % by volume for all grades of automotive gasoline. This is usually achieved by avoiding feeding C6, in particular cyclohexane, to the reformer unit, where it would be converted to benzene. Therefore, only (desulfurized) heavy virgin naphtha (HVN) is fed to the reformer unit

Gasoline can also contain other organic compounds, such as organic ethers (deliberately added), plus small levels of contaminants, in particular organosulfur compounds (which are usually removed at the refinery).

On average, U.S. petroleum refineries produce about 19 to 20 gallons of gasoline, 11 to 13 gallons of distillate fuel diesel fuel and 3 to 4 gallons of jet fuel from each 42 gallon (152 liters) barrel of crude oil. The product ratio depends upon the processing in an oil refinery and the crude oil assay.

==Physical properties==
===Density===
The specific gravity of gasoline ranges from 0.71 to 0.77, with higher densities having a greater volume fraction of aromatics. Finished marketable gasoline is traded (in Europe) with a standard reference of , (7,5668 lb/ imp gal) its price is escalated or de-escalated according to its actual density. Because of its low density, gasoline floats on water, and therefore water cannot generally be used to extinguish a gasoline fire unless applied in a fine mist.

===Stability===
Quality gasoline should be stable for six months if stored properly, but can degrade over time. Gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble. However, the effects of long-term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever-increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up. If left undiluted, improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a fuel injection system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate (if applicable to the vehicle). Gasoline should ideally be stored in an airtight container (to prevent oxidation or water vapor mixing in with the gas) that can withstand the vapor pressure of the gasoline without venting (to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions) at a stable cool temperature (to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions). When gasoline is not stored correctly, gums and solids may result, which can corrode system components and accumulate on wet surfaces, resulting in a condition called &quot;stale fuel&quot;. Gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture, then forming gums, solids, or two phases (a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water-alcohol phase).

The presence of these degradation products in the fuel tank or fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components makes it harder to start the engine or causes reduced engine performance On resumption of regular engine use, the buildup may or may not be eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline. The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly, though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long-term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle. Typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing mineral spirits, isopropyl alcohol, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene or other additives. Fuel stabilizers are commonly used for small engines, such as lawnmower and tractor engines, especially when their use is sporadic or seasonal (little to no use for one or more seasons of the year). Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure, to avoid storage at high temperatures, to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage, and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor.

Gasoline stability requirements are set by the standard ASTM D4814. This standard describes the various characteristics and requirements of automotive fuels for use over a wide range of operating conditions in ground vehicles equipped with spark-ignition engines.

===Combustion energy content===
A gasoline-fueled internal combustion engine obtains energy from the combustion of gasoline&#x27;s various hydrocarbons with oxygen from the ambient air, yielding carbon dioxide and water as exhaust. The combustion of octane, a representative species, performs the chemical reaction:

By weight, combustion of gasoline releases about or by volume , quoting the lower heating value. Gasoline blends differ, and therefore actual energy content varies according to the season and producer by up to 1.75 % more or less than the average. On average, about of gasoline are available from a barrel of crude oil (about 46 % by volume), varying with the quality of the crude and the grade of the gasoline. The remainder is products ranging from tar to naphtha.

A high-octane-rated fuel, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine tuned for LPG fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which is by far the greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high expansion ratio is also one of the two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake airflow.

The lower energy content of LPG by liquid volume in comparison to gasoline is due mainly to its lower density. This lower density is a property of the lower molecular weight of propane (LPG&#x27;s chief component) compared to gasoline&#x27;s blend of various hydrocarbon compounds with heavier molecular weights than propane. Conversely, LPG&#x27;s energy content by weight is higher than gasoline&#x27;s due to a higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio.

Molecular weights of the species in the representative octane combustion are 114, 32, 44, and 18 for C8H18, O2, CO2, and H2O, respectively; therefore of fuel reacts with of oxygen to produce of carbon dioxide and of water.

==Octane rating==
Spark-ignition engines are designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by pressure and heat alone, rather than igniting from the spark plug at exactly the right time, causing a rapid pressure rise that can damage the engine. This is often referred to as engine knocking or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline&#x27;s resistance to autoignition, which is expressed by its octane rating. A detailed analysis further explores the conditions where premium fuel provides actual performance benefits versus when it is unnecessary. 

Octane rating is measured relative to a mixture of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (an isomer of octane) and n-heptane. There are different conventions for expressing octane ratings, so the same physical fuel may have several different octane ratings based on the measure used. One of the best known is the research octane number (RON).

The octane rating of typical commercially available gasoline varies by country. In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, 95 RON is the standard for regular unleaded gasoline and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option.

In the United Kingdom, over 95% of gasoline sold has 95 RON and is marketed as Unleaded or Premium Unleaded. Super Unleaded, with 97/98 RON and branded high-performance fuels (e.g., Shell V-Power, BP Ultimate) with 99 RON make up the balance. Gasoline with 102 RON may rarely be available for racing purposes.

In the U.S., octane ratings in unleaded fuels vary between 85 and 87 AKI (91–92 RON) for regular, 89–90 AKI (94–95 RON) for mid-grade (equivalent to European regular), up to 90–94 AKI (95–99 RON) for premium (European premium).

As South Africa&#x27;s largest city, Johannesburg, is located on the Highveld at above sea level, the Automobile Association of South Africa recommends 95-octane gasoline at low altitude and 93-octane for use in Johannesburg because &quot;The higher the altitude the lower the air pressure, and the lower the need for a high octane fuel as there is no real performance gain&quot;.

Octane rating became important as the military sought higher output for aircraft engines in the late 1920s and the 1940s. A higher octane rating allows a higher compression ratio or supercharger boost, and thus higher temperatures and pressures, which translate to higher power output. Some scientists even predicted that a nation with a good supply of high-octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power. In 1943, the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine produced using 100 RON fuel from a modest displacement. By the time of Operation Overlord, both the RAF and USAAF were conducting some operations in Europe using 150 RON fuel (100/150 avgas), obtained by adding 2.5 % aniline to 100-octane avgas. By this time, the Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 was developing using this fuel.

==Additives==
===Antiknock additives===

====Tetraethyl lead====

Gasoline, when used in high-compression internal combustion engines, tends to auto-ignite or &quot;detonate&quot; causing damaging engine knocking (also called &quot;pinging&quot; or &quot;pinking&quot;). To address this problem, tetraethyl lead (TEL) was widely adopted as an additive for gasoline in the 1920s. With a growing awareness of the seriousness of the extent of environmental and health damage caused by lead compounds, however, and the incompatibility of lead with catalytic converters, governments began to mandate reductions in gasoline lead.

In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency issued regulations to reduce the lead content of leaded gasoline over a series of annual phases, scheduled to begin in 1973 but delayed by court appeals until 1976. By 1995, leaded fuel accounted for only 0.6 % of total gasoline sales and under () of lead per year. From 1 January 1996, the U.S. Clean Air Act banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on-road vehicles in the U.S. The use of TEL also necessitated other additives, such as dibromoethane.

European countries began replacing lead-containing additives by the end of the 1980s, and by the end of the 1990s, leaded gasoline was banned within the entire European Union with an exception for Avgas 100LL for general aviation. The UAE started to switch to unleaded in the early 2000s.

Reduction in the average lead content of human blood may be a major cause for falling violent crime rates around the world including South Africa. A study found a correlation between leaded gasoline usage and violent crime (see Lead–crime hypothesis). Other studies found no correlation.

In August 2021, the UN Environment Programme announced that leaded petrol had been eradicated worldwide, with Algeria being the last country to deplete its reserves. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the eradication of leaded petrol an &quot;international success story&quot;. He also added: &quot;Ending the use of leaded petrol will prevent more than one million premature deaths each year from heart disease, strokes and cancer, and it will protect children whose IQs are damaged by exposure to lead&quot;. Greenpeace called the announcement &quot;the end of one toxic era&quot;. However, leaded gasoline continues to be used in aeronautic, auto racing, and off-road applications. The use of leaded additives is still permitted worldwide for the formulation of some grades of aviation gasoline such as 100LL, because the required octane rating is difficult to reach without the use of leaded additives.

Different additives have replaced lead compounds. The most popular additives include aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers (MTBE and ETBE), and alcohols, most commonly ethanol.

==== Lead replacement petrol====
Lead replacement petrol (LRP) was developed for vehicles designed to run on leaded fuels and incompatible with unleaded fuels. Rather than tetraethyllead, it contains other metals such as potassium compounds or methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT); these are purported to buffer soft exhaust valves and seats so that they do not suffer recession due to the use of unleaded fuel.

LRP was marketed during and after the phaseout of leaded motor fuels in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, and some other countries. Consumer confusion led to a widespread mistaken preference for LRP rather than unleaded, and LRP was phased out 8 to 10 years after the introduction of unleaded.

Leaded gasoline was withdrawn from sale in Britain after 31 December 1999, seven years after EEC regulations signaled the end of production for cars using leaded gasoline in member states. At this stage, a large %age of cars from the 1980s and early 1990s which ran on leaded gasoline were still in use, along with cars that could run on unleaded fuel. However, the declining number of such cars on British roads saw many gasoline stations withdrawing LRP from sale by 2003.

====MMT====
Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) is used in Canada and the U.S. to boost octane rating. Its use in the U.S. has been restricted by regulations, although it is currently allowed. Its use in the European Union is restricted by Article 8a of the Fuel Quality Directive following its testing under the Protocol for the evaluation of effects of metallic fuel-additives on the emissions performance of vehicles.

===Fuel stabilizers (antioxidants and metal deactivators)===

Gummy, sticky resin deposits result from oxidative degradation of gasoline during long-term storage. These harmful deposits arise from the oxidation of alkenes and other minor components in gasoline (see drying oils). Improvements in refinery techniques have generally reduced the susceptibility of gasolines to these problems. Previously, catalytically or thermally cracked gasolines were most susceptible to oxidation. The formation of gums is accelerated by copper salts, which can be neutralized by additives called metal deactivators.

This degradation can be prevented through the addition of 5–100 ppm of antioxidants, such as phenylenediamines and other amines. Hydrocarbons with a bromine number of 10 or above can be protected with the combination of unhindered or partially hindered phenols and oil-soluble strong amine bases, such as hindered phenols. &quot;Stale&quot; gasoline can be detected by a colorimetric enzymatic test for organic peroxides produced by oxidation of the gasoline.

Gasolines are also treated with metal deactivators, which are compounds that sequester (deactivate) metal salts that otherwise accelerate the formation of gummy residues. The metal impurities might arise from the engine itself or as contaminants in the fuel.

===Detergents===
Gasoline, as delivered at the pump, also contains additives to reduce internal engine carbon buildups, improve combustion and allow easier starting in cold climates. High levels of detergent can be found in Top Tier Detergent Gasolines. The specification for Top Tier Detergent Gasolines was developed by four automakers: GM, Honda, Toyota, and BMW. According to the bulletin, the minimal U.S. EPA requirement is not sufficient to keep engines clean. Typical detergents include alkylamines and alkyl phosphates at a level of 50–100 ppm.

===Ethanol===

====European Union====

In the EU, 5 % ethanol can be added within the common gasoline spec (EN 228). Discussions are ongoing to allow 10 % blending of ethanol (available in Finnish, French and German gasoline stations). In Finland, most gasoline stations sell 95E10, which is 10 % ethanol, and 98E5, which is 5 % ethanol. Most gasoline sold in Sweden has 5–15 % ethanol added. Three different ethanol blends are sold in the Netherlands—E5, E10 and hE15. The last of these differs from standard ethanol–gasoline blends in that it consists of 15 % hydrous ethanol (i.e., the ethanol–water azeotrope) instead of the anhydrous ethanol traditionally used for blending with gasoline.

====Brazil====
The Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) requires gasoline for automobile use to have 27.5 % of ethanol added to its composition. Pure hydrated ethanol is also available as a fuel.

====Australia====

Legislation requires retailers to label fuels containing ethanol on the dispenser, and limits ethanol use to 10 % of gasoline in Australia. Such gasoline is commonly called E10 by major brands, and it is cheaper than regular unleaded gasoline.

==== U.S. ====

The federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) effectively requires refiners and blenders to blend renewable biofuels (mostly ethanol) with gasoline, sufficient to meet a growing annual target of total gallons blended. Although the mandate does not require a specific %age of ethanol, annual increases in the target combined with declining gasoline consumption have caused the typical ethanol content in gasoline to approach 10 %. Most fuel pumps display a sticker that states that the fuel may contain up to 10 % ethanol, an intentional disparity that reflects the varying actual %age. In parts of the U.S., ethanol is sometimes added to gasoline without an indication that it is a component.

====India====
In October 2007, the Government of India decided to make five % ethanol blending (with gasoline) mandatory. Currently, 10 % ethanol blended product (E10) is being sold in various parts of the country. Ethanol has been found in at least one study to damage catalytic converters.

===Dyes===
Though gasoline is a naturally colorless liquid, many gasolines are dyed in various colors to indicate their composition and acceptable uses. In Australia, the lowest grade of gasoline (RON 91) was dyed a light shade of red/orange, but is now the same color as the medium grade (RON 95) and high octane (RON 98), which are dyed yellow. In the U.S., aviation gasoline (avgas) is dyed to identify its octane rating and to distinguish it from kerosene-based jet fuel, which is left colorless. In Canada, the gasoline for marine and farm use is dyed red and is not subject to fuel excise tax in most provinces.

===Oxygenate blending===
Oxygenate blending adds oxygen-bearing compounds such as methanol, MTBE, ETBE, TAME, TAEE, ethanol, and biobutanol. The presence of these oxygenates reduces the amount of carbon monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust. In many areas throughout the U.S., oxygenate blending is mandated by EPA regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants. For example, in Southern California fuel must contain two % oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6 % ethanol in gasoline. The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline (RFG) or oxygenated gasoline, or, in the case of California, California reformulated gasoline (CARBOB). The federal requirement that RFG contain oxygen was dropped on 6 May 2006 because the industry had developed VOC-controlled RFG that did not need additional oxygen.

MTBE was phased out in the U.S. due to groundwater contamination and the resulting regulations and lawsuits. Ethanol and, to a lesser extent, ethanol-derived ETBE are common substitutes. A common ethanol-gasoline mix of 10 % ethanol mixed with gasoline is called gasohol or E10, and an ethanol-gasoline mix of 85 % ethanol mixed with gasoline is called E85. The most extensive use of ethanol takes place in Brazil, where the ethanol is derived from sugarcane. In 2004, over of ethanol was produced in the U.S. for fuel use, mostly from corn and sold as E10. E85 is slowly becoming available in much of the U.S., though many of the relatively few stations vending E85 are not open to the general public.

The use of bioethanol and bio-methanol, either directly or indirectly by conversion of ethanol to bio-ETBE, or methanol to bio-MTBE is encouraged by the European Union Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport. Since producing bioethanol from fermented sugars and starches involves distillation, though, ordinary people in much of Europe cannot legally ferment and distill their own bioethanol at present (unlike in the U.S., where getting a BATF distillation permit has been easy since the 1973 oil crisis).

==Safety==
===Toxicity===
The safety data sheet for a 2003 Texan unleaded gasoline shows at least 15 hazardous chemicals occurring in various amounts, including benzene (up to five % by volume), toluene (up to 35 % by volume), naphthalene (up to one % by volume), trimethylbenzene (up to seven % by volume), methyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether (MTBE) (up to 18 % by volume, in some states), and about 10 others. Hydrocarbons in gasoline generally exhibit low acute toxicities, with LD50 of 700–2700 mg/kg for simple aromatic compounds. Benzene and many antiknocking additives are carcinogenic.

People can be exposed to gasoline in the workplace by swallowing it, breathing in vapors, skin contact, and eye contact. Gasoline is toxic. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has also designated gasoline as a carcinogen. Physical contact, ingestion, or inhalation can cause health problems. Since ingesting large amounts of gasoline can cause permanent damage to major organs, a call to a local poison control center or emergency room visit is indicated.

Contrary to common misconception, swallowing gasoline does not generally require special emergency treatment, and inducing vomiting does not help, and can make it worse. According to poison specialist Brad Dahl, &quot;even two mouthfuls wouldn&#x27;t be that dangerous as long as it goes down to your stomach and stays there or keeps going&quot;. The U.S. CDC&#x27;s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry says not to induce vomiting, lavage, or administer activated charcoal.

===Inhalation for intoxication===
Inhaled (huffed) gasoline vapor is a common intoxicant. Users concentrate and inhale gasoline vapor in a manner not intended by the manufacturer to produce euphoria and intoxication. Gasoline inhalation has become epidemic in some poorer communities and indigenous groups in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and some Pacific Islands. The practice is thought to cause severe organ damage, along with other effects such as intellectual disability and various cancers.

In Canada, Native children in the isolated Northern Labrador community of Davis Inlet were the focus of national concern in 1993, when many were found to be sniffing gasoline. The Canadian and provincial Newfoundland and Labrador governments intervened on several occasions, sending many children away for treatment. Despite being moved to the new community of Natuashish in 2002, serious inhalant abuse problems have continued. Similar problems were reported in Sheshatshiu in 2000 and also in Pikangikum First Nation. In 2012, the issue once again made the news media in Canada.

Australia has long faced a petrol (gasoline) sniffing problem in isolated and impoverished aboriginal communities. Although some sources argue that sniffing was introduced by U.S. servicemen stationed in the nation&#x27;s Top End during World War II or through experimentation by 1940s-era Cobourg Peninsula sawmill workers, other sources claim that inhalant abuse (such as glue inhalation) emerged in Australia in the late 1960s. Chronic, heavy petrol sniffing appears to occur among remote, impoverished indigenous communities, where the ready accessibility of petrol has helped to make it a common substance for abuse.

In Australia, petrol sniffing now occurs widely throughout remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, northern parts of South Australia, and Queensland. The number of people sniffing petrol goes up and down over time as young people experiment or sniff occasionally. &quot;Boss&quot;, or chronic, sniffers may move in and out of communities; they are often responsible for encouraging young people to take it up. In 2005, the Government of Australia and BP Australia began the usage of Opal fuel in remote areas prone to petrol sniffing. Opal is a non-sniffable fuel (which is much less likely to cause a high) and has made a difference in some indigenous communities.

===Flammability===

Gasoline is flammable with low flash point of . Gasoline has a lower explosive limit of 1.4 % by volume and an upper explosive limit of 7.6 %. If the concentration is below 1.4 %, the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite. If the concentration is above 7.6 %, the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite. However, gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air, making unconstrained gasoline quickly flammable.

===Gasoline exhaust===
The exhaust gas generated by burning gasoline is harmful to both the environment and to human health. After CO is inhaled into the human body, it readily combines with hemoglobin in the blood, and its affinity is 300 times that of oxygen. Therefore, the hemoglobin in the lungs combines with CO instead of oxygen, causing the human body to be hypoxic, causing headaches, dizziness, vomiting, and other poisoning symptoms. In severe cases, it may lead to death. Hydrocarbons only affect the human body when their concentration is quite high, and their toxicity level depends on the chemical composition. The hydrocarbons produced by incomplete combustion include alkanes, aromatics, and aldehydes. Among them, a concentration of methane and ethane over will cause loss of consciousness or suffocation, a concentration of pentane and hexane over will have an anesthetic effect, and aromatic hydrocarbons will have more serious effects on health, blood toxicity, neurotoxicity, and cancer. If the concentration of benzene exceeds 40 ppm, it can cause leukemia, and xylene can cause headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Human exposure to large amounts of aldehydes can cause eye irritation, nausea, and dizziness. In addition to carcinogenic effects, long-term exposure can cause damage to the skin, liver, kidneys, and cataracts. After NOx enters the alveoli, it has a severe stimulating effect on the lung tissue. It can irritate the conjunctiva of the eyes, cause tearing, and cause pink eyes. It also has a stimulating effect on the nose, pharynx, throat, and other organs. It can cause acute wheezing, breathing difficulties, red eyes, sore throat, and dizziness causing poisoning. Fine particulates are also dangerous to health.

== Environmental effect ==
The air pollution in many large cities has changed from coal-burning pollution to &quot;motor vehicle pollution&quot;. In the U.S., transportation is the largest source of carbon emissions, accounting for 30 % of the total carbon footprint of the U.S. Combustion of gasoline produces of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.

Unburnt gasoline and evaporation from the tank, when in the atmosphere, react in sunlight to produce photochemical smog. Vapor pressure initially rises with some addition of ethanol to gasoline, but the increase is greatest at 10 % by volume. At higher concentrations of ethanol above 10 %, the vapor pressure of the blend starts to decrease. At a 10 % ethanol by volume, the rise in vapor pressure may potentially increase the problem of photochemical smog. This rise in vapor pressure could be mitigated by increasing or decreasing the %age of ethanol in the gasoline mixture. The chief risks of such leaks come not from vehicles, but gasoline delivery truck accidents and leaks from storage tanks. Because of this risk, most (underground) storage tanks now have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent any such leaks, such as monitoring systems (Veeder-Root, Franklin Fueling).

Production of gasoline consumes of water by driven distance.

Gasoline use causes a variety of deleterious effects to the human population and to the climate generally. The harms imposed include a higher rate of premature death and ailments, such as asthma, caused by air pollution, higher healthcare costs for the public generally, decreased crop yields, missed work and school days due to illness, increased flooding and other extreme weather events linked to global climate change, and other social costs. The costs imposed on society and the planet are estimated to be $3.80 per gallon of gasoline, in addition to the price paid at the pump by the user. The damage to the health and climate caused by a gasoline-powered vehicle greatly exceeds that caused by electric vehicles.

Gasoline can be released into the Earth&#x27;s environment as an uncombusted liquid fuel, as a flammable liquid, or as a vapor by way of leakages occurring during its production, handling, transport and delivery. Gasoline contains known carcinogens, and gasoline exhaust is a health risk. Gasoline is often used as a recreational inhalant and can be harmful or fatal when used in such a manner. When burned, of gasoline emits about of , a greenhouse gas, contributing to human-caused climate change. Oil products, including gasoline, were responsible for about 32% of emissions worldwide in 2021.

===Carbon dioxide===
About of carbon dioxide (CO2) are produced from burning gasoline that does not contain ethanol. Most of the retail gasoline now sold in the U.S. contains about 10 % fuel ethanol (or E10) by volume. Burning E10 produces about of CO2 that is emitted from the fossil fuel content. If the CO2 emissions from ethanol combustion are considered, then about of CO2 are produced when E10 is combusted.

Worldwide 7 liters of gasoline are burnt for every 100 km driven by cars and vans.

In 2021, the International Energy Agency stated, &quot;To ensure fuel economy and CO2 emissions standards are effective, governments must continue regulatory efforts to monitor and reduce the gap between real-world fuel economy and rated performance.&quot;

===Contamination of soil and water===
Gasoline enters the environment through the soil, groundwater, surface water, and air. Therefore, humans may be exposed to gasoline through methods such as breathing, eating, and skin contact. For example, using gasoline-filled equipment, such as lawnmowers, drinking gasoline-contaminated water close to gasoline spills or leaks to the soil, working at a gasoline station, inhaling gasoline volatile gas when refueling at a gasoline station is the easiest way to be exposed to gasoline.

==Use and pricing==
The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that &quot;road fuels should be taxed at a rate that reflects their impact on people&#x27;s health and the climate&quot;.

===Europe===
Countries in Europe impose substantially higher taxes on fuels such as gasoline when compared to the U.S. The price of gasoline in Europe is typically higher than that in the U.S. due to this difference.

=== U.S. ===

From 1998 to 2004, the price of gasoline fluctuated between . After 2004, the price increased until the average gasoline price reached a high of in mid-2008 but receded to approximately by September 2009. The U.S. experienced an upswing in gasoline prices through 2011, and, by 1 March 2012, the national average was . California prices are higher because the California government mandates unique California gasoline formulas and taxes.

In the U.S., most consumer goods bear pre-tax prices, but gasoline prices are posted with taxes included. Taxes are added by federal, state, and local governments. , the federal tax was for gasoline and for diesel (excluding red diesel).

About nine % of all gasoline sold in the U.S. in May 2009 was premium grade, according to the Energy Information Administration. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine says, &quot;If [your owner&#x27;s manual] says to use regular fuel, do so—there&#x27;s no advantage to a higher grade.&quot; The &quot;Associated Press&quot; said premium gas—which has a higher octane rating and costs more per gallon than regular unleaded—should be used only if the manufacturer says it is &quot;required&quot;. Cars with turbocharged engines and high compression ratios often specify premium gasoline because higher octane fuels reduce the incidence of &quot;knock&quot;, or fuel pre-detonation. The price of gasoline varies considerably between the summer and winter months.

There is a considerable difference between summer oil and winter oil in gasoline vapor pressure (Reid Vapor Pressure, RVP), which is a measure of how easily the fuel evaporates at a given temperature. The higher the gasoline volatility (the higher the RVP), the easier it is to evaporate. The conversion between the two fuels occurs twice a year, once in autumn (winter mix) and the other in spring (summer mix). The winter blended fuel has a higher RVP because the fuel must be able to evaporate at a low temperature for the engine to run normally. If the RVP is too low on a cold day, the vehicle will be difficult to start; however, the summer blended gasoline has a lower RVP. It prevents excessive evaporation when the outdoor temperature rises, reduces ozone emissions, and reduces smog levels. At the same time, vapor lock is less likely to occur in hot weather.

<text>In chemistry, a pentose is a monosaccharide (simple sugar) with five carbon atoms. The chemical formula of many pentoses is , and their molecular weight is 150.13 g/mol.

Pentoses are very important in biochemistry. Ribose is a constituent of RNA, and the related molecule, deoxyribose, is a constituent of DNA. Phosphorylated pentoses are important products of the pentose phosphate pathway, most importantly ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), which is used in the synthesis of nucleotides and nucleic acids.

Like some other monosaccharides, pentoses exist in two forms, open-chain (linear) or closed-chain (cyclic), that easily convert into each other in water solutions. The linear form of a pentose, which usually exists only in solutions, has an open-chain backbone of five carbons. Four of these carbons have one hydroxyl functional group (–OH) each, connected by a single bond, and one has an oxygen atom connected by a double bond (=O), forming a carbonyl group (C=O). The remaining bonds of the carbon atoms are satisfied by six hydrogen atoms. Thus the structure of the linear form is H–(CHOH)&quot;x&quot;–C(=O)–(CHOH)4-&quot;x&quot;–H, where &quot;x&quot; is 0, 1, or 2.

The term &quot;pentose&quot; sometimes is assumed to include deoxypentoses, such as deoxyribose: compounds with general formula that can be described as derived from pentoses by replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with hydrogen atoms.

==Classification==
The aldopentoses are a subclass of the pentoses which, in the linear form, have the carbonyl at carbon 1, forming an aldehyde derivative with structure H–C(=O)–(CHOH)4–H. The most important example is ribose. The ketopentoses instead have the carbonyl at positions 2 or 3, forming a ketone derivative with structure H–CHOH–C(=O)–(CHOH)3–H (2-ketopentose) or H–(CHOH)2–C(=O)–(CHOH)2–H (3-ketopentose). The latter is not known to occur in nature and are difficult to synthesize. 

In the open form, there are eight aldopentoses and four 2-ketopentoses, stereoisomers that differ in the spatial position of the hydroxyl groups. These forms occur in pairs of optical isomers, generally labelled &quot; or &quot; by conventional rules (independently of their optical activity).

===Aldopentoses===

The aldopentoses have three chiral centers; therefore, eight (23) different stereoisomers are possible.
Ribose is a constituent of RNA, and the related molecule, deoxyribose, is a constituent of DNA. Phosphorylated pentoses are important products of the pentose phosphate pathway, most importantly ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), which is used in the synthesis of nucleotides and nucleic acids, and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P), which is used in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids.

===Ketopentoses===

The 2-ketopentoses have two chiral centers; therefore, four (22) different stereoisomers are possible. The 3-ketopentoses are rare.

==Cyclic forms==
The closed or cyclic form of a pentose forms when the carbonyl group reacts with a hydroxyl in another carbon, turning the carbonyl into a hydroxyl and creating an ether bridge –O– between the two carbons. This intramolecular reaction yields a cyclic molecule, with a ring consisting of one oxygen atom and usually four carbon atoms; the cyclic compounds are then called furanoses, for having the same rings as the cyclic ether tetrahydrofuran.

The ring closure converts the carbonyl carbon into a chiral center, which may adopt either of two configurations, depending on the position of the new hydroxyl. Therefore, each linear form can produce two distinct closed forms, identified by prefixes &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;.

==Deoxypentoses==

The one deoxypentose has two total stereoisomers.
==Properties==
In the cell, pentoses have a higher metabolic stability than hexoses.

A polymer composed of pentose sugars is called a pentosan.

===Tests for pentoses===
The most important tests for pentoses rely on converting the pentose to furfural, which then reacts with a chromophore. In Tollens’ test for pentoses (not to be confused with Tollens&#x27; silver-mirror test for reducing sugars), the furfural ring reacts with phloroglucinol to produce a colored compound; in the aniline acetate test with aniline acetate; and in Bial&#x27;s test, with orcinol. In each of these tests, pentoses react much more strongly and quickly than hexoses.

<text>Propane () is a three-carbon alkane with the molecular formula . It is a gas at standard temperature and pressure, but compressible to a transportable liquid. A by-product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining, it is often a constituent of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which is commonly used as a fuel in domestic and industrial applications and in low-emissions public transportation; other constituents of LPG may include propylene, butane, butylene, butadiene, and isobutylene. Discovered in 1857 by the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot, it became commercially available in the US by 1911. Propane has lower volumetric energy density than gasoline or coal, but has higher gravimetric energy density than them and burns more cleanly.

Propane gas has become a popular choice for barbecues and portable stoves because its low −42 °C boiling point makes it vaporise inside pressurised liquid containers (it exists in two phases, vapor above liquid). It retains its ability to vaporise even in cold weather, making it better-suited for outdoor use in cold climates than alternatives with higher boiling points like butane. LPG powers buses, forklifts, automobiles, outboard boat motors, and ice resurfacing machines, and is used for heat and cooking in recreational vehicles and campers. Propane is becoming popular as a replacement refrigerant (R290) for heatpumps also as it offers greater efficiency than the current refrigerants: R410A / R32, higher temperature heat output and less damage to the atmosphere for escaped gasses—at the expense of high gas flammability.

== History ==
Propane was first synthesized by the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot in 1857 during his researches on hydrogenation. Berthelot made propane by heating propylene dibromide (C3H6Br2) with potassium iodide and water. Propane was found dissolved in Pennsylvanian light crude oil by Edmund Ronalds in 1864. Walter O. Snelling of the U.S. Bureau of Mines highlighted it as a volatile component in gasoline in 1910, which marked the &quot;birth of the propane industry&quot; in the United States. The volatility of these lighter hydrocarbons caused them to be known as &quot;wild&quot; because of the high vapor pressures of unrefined gasoline. On March 31, 1912, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on Snelling&#x27;s work with liquefied gas, saying &quot;a steel bottle will carry enough gas to light an ordinary home for three weeks&quot;.

It was during this time that Snelling&quot;—&quot;in cooperation with Frank P. Peterson, Chester Kerr, and Arthur Kerr&quot;—&quot;developed ways to liquefy the LP gases during the refining of gasoline. Together, they established American Gasol Co., the first commercial marketer of propane. Snelling had produced relatively pure propane by 1911, and on March 25, 1913, his method of processing and producing LP gases was issued patent #1,056,845. A separate method of producing LP gas through compression was developed by Frank Peterson and its patent was granted on July 2, 1912.

The 1920s saw increased production of LP gases, with the first year of recorded production totaling in 1922. In 1927, annual marketed LP gas production reached , and by 1935, the annual sales of LP gas had reached . Major industry developments in the 1930s included the introduction of railroad tank car transport, gas odorization, and the construction of local bottle-filling plants. The year 1945 marked the first year that annual LP gas sales reached a billion gallons. By 1947, 62% of all U.S. homes had been equipped with either natural gas or propane for cooking.

In 1950, 1,000 propane-fueled buses were ordered by the Chicago Transit Authority, and by 1958, sales in the U.S. had reached annually. In 2004, it was reported to be a growing $8-billion to $10-billion industry with over of propane being used annually in the U.S.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, propane shortages were reported in the United States due to increased demand.

== Etymology ==
The &quot;prop-&quot; root found in &quot;propane&quot; and names of other compounds with three-carbon chains was derived from &quot;propionic acid&quot;, which in turn was named after the Greek words protos (meaning first) and pion (fat), as it was the &quot;first&quot; member of the series of fatty acids.

== Properties and reactions ==
Propane is a colorless, odorless gas. Ethyl mercaptan is added as a safety precaution as an odorant, and is commonly called a &quot;rotten egg&quot; smell. At normal pressure it liquifies below its boiling point at −42 °C and solidifies below its melting point at −187.7 °C. Propane crystallizes in the space group P21/n. The low space-filling of 58.5% (at 90 K), due to the bad stacking properties of the molecule, is the reason for the particularly low melting point.

Propane undergoes combustion reactions in a similar fashion to other alkanes. In the presence of excess oxygen, propane burns to form water and carbon dioxide.
&lt;chem display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;C3H8 + 5 O2 -&gt; 3 CO2 + 4 H2O + heat &lt;/chem&gt;
When insufficient oxygen is present for complete combustion, carbon monoxide, soot (carbon), or both, are formed as well:
&lt;chem display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;C3H8 + 9/2 O2 -&gt; 2 CO2 + CO + 4 H2O + heat &lt;/chem&gt;
&lt;chem display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;C3H8 + 2 O2 -&gt; 3 C + 4 H2O + heat &lt;/chem&gt;
The complete combustion of propane produces about 50 MJ/kg of heat.

Propane combustion is much cleaner than that of coal or unleaded gasoline. Propane&#x27;s per-BTU production of CO2 is almost as low as that of natural gas. Propane burns hotter than home heating oil or diesel fuel because of the very high hydrogen content. The presence of C–C bonds, plus the multiple bonds of propylene and butylene, produce organic exhausts besides carbon dioxide and water vapor during typical combustion. These bonds also cause propane to burn with a visible flame.

=== Energy content ===
The enthalpy of combustion of propane gas where all products return to standard state, for example where water returns to its liquid state at standard temperature (known as higher heating value), is (2,219.2 ± 0.5) kJ/mol, or (50.33 ± 0.01) MJ/kg.

The enthalpy of combustion of propane gas where products do not return to standard state, for example where the hot gases including water vapor exit a chimney, (known as lower heating value) is −2043.455 kJ/mol. The lower heat value is the amount of heat available from burning the substance where the combustion products are vented to the atmosphere; for example, the heat from a fireplace when the flue is open.

=== Density ===
The density of propane gas at 25 °C (77 °F) is 1.808 kg/m3, about 1.5× the density of air at the same temperature. The density of liquid propane at 25 °C (77 °F) is 0.493 g/cm3, which is equivalent to 4.11 pounds per U.S. liquid gallon or 493 g/L. Propane expands at 1.5% per 10 °F. Thus, liquid propane has a density of approximately 4.2 pounds per gallon (504 g/L) at 60 °F (15.6 °C).

As the density of propane changes with temperature, this fact must be considered every time when the application is connected with safety or custody transfer operations.
== Uses ==
===Portable stoves===
Propane is a popular choice for barbecues and portable stoves because the low boiling point of makes it vaporize as soon as it is released from its pressurized container. Therefore, no carburetor or other vaporizing device is required; a simple metering nozzle suffices.

=== Refrigerant ===

Blends of pure, dry &quot;isopropane&quot; [isobutane/propane mixtures of propane (R-290) and isobutane (R-600a)] can be used as the circulating refrigerant in suitably constructed compressor-based refrigeration. Compared to fluorocarbons, propane has a negligible ozone depletion potential and very low global warming potential (having a GWP value of 0.072, 13.9 times lower than the GWP of carbon dioxide) and can serve as a functional replacement for R-12, R-22, R-134a, and other chlorofluorocarbon or hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in conventional stationary refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Because its global warming effect is far less than current refrigerants, propane was chosen as one of five replacement refrigerants approved by the EPA in 2015, for use in systems specially designed to handle its flammability.

Such substitution is widely prohibited or discouraged in motor vehicle air conditioning systems, on the grounds that using flammable hydrocarbons in systems originally designed to carry non-flammable refrigerant presents a significant risk of fire or explosion.

Vendors and advocates of hydrocarbon refrigerants argue against such bans on the grounds that there have been very few such incidents relative to the number of vehicle air conditioning systems filled with hydrocarbons.

Propane is also instrumental in providing off-the-grid refrigeration, as the energy source for a gas absorption refrigerator and is commonly used for camping and recreational vehicles.

It has also been proposed to use propane as a refrigerant in heat pumps.

=== Domestic and industrial fuel ===

Since it can be transported easily, it is a popular fuel for home heat and backup electrical generation in sparsely populated areas that do not have natural gas pipelines. In June 2023, Stanford researchers found propane combustion emitted detectable and repeatable levels of benzene that in some homes raised indoor benzene concentrations above well-established health benchmarks. The research also shows that gas and propane fuels appear to be the dominant source of benzene produced by cooking.

In rural areas of North America, as well as northern Australia, propane is used to heat livestock facilities, in grain dryers, and other heat-producing appliances. When used for heating or grain drying it is usually stored in a large, permanently-placed cylinder which is refilled by a propane-delivery truck. , 6.2 million American households use propane as their primary heating fuel.

In North America, local delivery trucks with an average cylinder size of , fill up large cylinders that are permanently installed on the property, or other service trucks exchange empty cylinders of propane with filled cylinders. Large tractor-trailer trucks, with an average cylinder size of , transport propane from the pipeline or refinery to the local bulk plant. The bobtail tank truck is not unique to the North American market, though the practice is not as common elsewhere, and the vehicles are generally called &quot;tankers&quot;. In many countries, propane is delivered to end-users via small or medium-sized individual cylinders, while empty cylinders are removed for refilling at a central location.

There are also community propane systems, with a central cylinder feeding individual homes.

=== Motor fuel ===

In the U.S., over 190,000 on-road vehicles use propane, and over 450,000 forklifts use it for power. It is the third most popular vehicle fuel in the world, behind gasoline and diesel fuel. In other parts of the world, propane used in vehicles is known as autogas. In 2007, approximately 13 million vehicles worldwide use autogas.

The advantage of propane in cars is its liquid state at a moderate pressure. This allows fast refill times, affordable fuel cylinder construction, and price ranges typically just over half that of gasoline. Meanwhile, it is noticeably cleaner (both in handling, and in combustion), results in less engine wear (due to carbon deposits) without diluting engine oil (often extending oil-change intervals), and until recently was relatively low-cost in North America. The octane rating of propane is relatively high at 110. In the United States the propane fueling infrastructure is the most developed of all alternative vehicle fuels. Many converted vehicles have provisions for topping off from &quot;barbecue bottles&quot;. Purpose-built vehicles are often in commercially owned fleets, and have private fueling facilities. A further saving for propane fuel vehicle operators, especially in fleets, is that theft is much more difficult than with gasoline or diesel fuels.

Propane is also used as fuel for small engines, especially those used indoors or in areas with insufficient fresh air and ventilation to carry away the more toxic exhaust of an engine running on gasoline or diesel fuel. More recently, there have been lawn-care products like string trimmers, lawn mowers and leaf blowers intended for outdoor use, but fueled by propane in order to reduce air pollution.

Many heavy-duty highway trucks use propane as a boost, where it is added through the turbocharger, to mix with diesel fuel droplets. Propane droplets&#x27; very high hydrogen content helps the diesel fuel to burn hotter and therefore more completely. This provides more torque, more horsepower, and a cleaner exhaust for the trucks. It is normal for a 7-liter medium-duty diesel truck engine to increase fuel economy by 20 to 33 percent when a propane boost system is used. It is cheaper because propane is much cheaper than diesel fuel. The longer distance a cross-country trucker can travel on a full load of combined diesel and propane fuel means they can maintain federal hours of work rules with two fewer fuel stops in a cross-country trip. Truckers, tractor pulling competitions, and farmers have been using a propane boost system for over forty years in North America.

=== Other uses ===

*Propane is the primary flammable gas in blowtorches for soldering.
*Propane is used in oxy-fuel welding and cutting. Propane does not burn as hot as acetylene in its inner cone, and so it is rarely used for welding. Propane, however, has a very high number of BTUs per cubic foot in its outer cone, and so with the right torch (injector style) it can make a faster and cleaner cut than acetylene, and is much more useful for heating and bending than acetylene.
*Propane is used as a feedstock for the production of base petrochemicals in steam cracking.
*Propane is the primary fuel for hot-air balloons.
*It is used in semiconductor manufacture to deposit silicon carbide.
*Propane is commonly used in theme parks and in movie production as an inexpensive, high-energy fuel for explosions and other special effects.
*Propane is used as a propellant, relying on the expansion of the gas to fire the projectile. It does not ignite the gas. The use of a liquefied gas gives more shots per cylinder, compared to a compressed gas.
*Propane is also used as a cooking fuel.
*Propane is used as a propellant for many household aerosol sprays, including shaving creams and air fresheners.
*Propane is a promising feedstock for the production of propylene.
*Liquified propane is used in the extraction of animal fats and vegetable oils.

==Purity==
The North American standard grade of automotive-use propane is rated HD-5 (Heavy Duty 5%). HD-5 grade has a maximum of 5 percent butane, but propane sold in Europe has a maximum allowable amount of butane of 30 percent, meaning it is not the same fuel as HD-5. The LPG used as auto fuel and cooking gas in Asia and Australia also has very high butane content.

Propylene (also called propene) can be a contaminant of commercial propane. Propane containing too much propene is not suited for most vehicle fuels. HD-5 is a specification that establishes a maximum concentration of 5% propene in propane. Propane and other LP gas specifications are established in ASTM D-1835. All propane fuels include an odorant, almost always ethanethiol, so that the gas can be smelled easily in case of a leak. Propane as HD-5 was originally intended for use as vehicle fuel. HD-5 is currently being used in all propane applications.

Typically in the United States and Canada, LPG is primarily propane (at least 90%), while the rest is mostly ethane, propylene, butane, and odorants including ethyl mercaptan. This is the HD-5 standard, (maximum allowable propylene content, and no more than 5% butanes and ethane) defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials by its Standard 1835 for internal combustion engines. Not all products labeled &quot;LPG&quot; conform to this standard, however. In Mexico, for example, gas labeled &quot;LPG&quot; may consist of 60% propane and 40% butane. &quot;The exact proportion of this combination varies by country, depending on international prices, on the availability of components and, especially, on the climatic conditions that favor LPG with higher butane content in warmer regions and propane in cold areas&quot;.

== Comparison with natural gas ==
Propane is bought and stored in a liquid form, LPG. It can easily be stored in a relatively small space.

By comparison, compressed natural gas (CNG) cannot be liquefied by compression at normal temperatures, as these are well above its critical temperature. As a gas, very high pressure is required to store useful quantities. This poses the hazard that, in an accident, just as with any compressed gas cylinder (such as a CO2 cylinder used for a soda concession) a CNG cylinder may burst with great force, or leak rapidly enough to become a self-propelled missile. Therefore, CNG is much less efficient to store than propane, due to the large cylinder volume required. An alternative means of storing natural gas is as a cryogenic liquid in an insulated container as liquefied natural gas (LNG). This form of storage is at low pressure and is around 3.5 times as efficient as storing it as CNG.

Unlike propane, if a spill occurs, CNG will evaporate and dissipate because it is lighter than air.

Propane is much more commonly used to fuel vehicles than is natural gas, because that equipment costs less. Propane requires just of pressure to keep it liquid at .

== Hazards ==
Propane is a simple asphyxiant. Unlike natural gas, it is denser than air. It may accumulate in low spaces and near the floor. When abused as an inhalant, it may cause hypoxia (lack of oxygen), pneumonia, cardiac failure or cardiac arrest. Propane has low toxicity since it is not readily absorbed and is not biologically active. Commonly stored under pressure at room temperature, propane and its mixtures will flash evaporate at atmospheric pressure and cool well below the freezing point of water. The cold gas, which appears white due to moisture condensing from the air, may cause frostbite.

Propane is denser than air. If a leak in a propane fuel system occurs, the vaporized gas will have a tendency to sink into any enclosed area and thus poses a risk of explosion and fire. The typical scenario is a leaking cylinder stored in a basement; the propane leak drifts across the floor to the pilot light on the furnace or water heater, and results in an explosion or fire. This property makes propane generally unsuitable as a fuel for boats. In 2007, a heavily investigated vapor-related explosion occurred in Ghent, West Virginia, U.S., killing four people and completely destroying the Little General convenience store on Flat Top Road, causing several injuries.

Another hazard associated with propane storage and transport is known as a BLEVE or boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion. The Kingman Explosion involved a railroad tank car in Kingman, Arizona, U.S., in 1973 during a propane transfer. The fire and subsequent explosions resulted in twelve fatalities and numerous injuries.

== Production ==
Propane is produced as a by-product of two other processes, natural gas processing and petroleum refining. The processing of natural gas involves removal of butane, propane, and large amounts of ethane from the raw gas, to prevent condensation of these volatiles in natural gas pipelines. Additionally, oil refineries produce some propane as a by-product of cracking petroleum into gasoline or heating oil.

The supply of propane cannot easily be adjusted to meet increased demand, because of the by-product nature of propane production. About 90% of U.S. propane is domestically produced. The United States imports about 10% of the propane consumed each year, with about 70% of that coming from Canada via pipeline and rail. The remaining 30% of imported propane comes to the United States from other sources via ocean transport.

After it is separated from the crude oil, North American propane is stored in huge salt caverns. Examples of these are Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta; Mont Belvieu, Texas; and Conway, Kansas. These salt caverns can store of propane.

=== Retail cost ===
==== United States ====
, the retail cost of propane was approximately $2.37 per gallon, or roughly $25.95 per 1 million BTUs. This means that filling a 500-gallon propane tank, which is what households that use propane as their main source of energy usually require, cost $948 (80% of 500 gallons or 400 gallons), a 7.5% increase on the 2012–2013 winter season average US price. However, propane costs per gallon change significantly from one state to another: the Energy Information Administration (EIA) quotes a $2.995 per gallon average on the East Coast for October 2013, while the figure for the Midwest was $1.860 for the same period.

, the propane retail cost was approximately $1.97 per gallon, which meant filling a 500-gallon propane tank to 80% capacity costed $788, a 16.9% decrease or $160 less from November 2013. Similar regional differences in prices are present with the December 2015 EIA figure for the East Coast at $2.67 per gallon and the Midwest at $1.43 per gallon.

, the average US propane retail cost was approximately $2.48 per gallon. The wholesale price of propane in the U.S. always drops in the summer as most homes do not require it for home heating. The wholesale price of propane in the summer of 2018 was between 86 cents to 96 cents per U.S. gallon, based on a truckload or railway car load. The price for home heating was exactly double that price; at 95 cents per gallon wholesale, a home-delivered price was $1.90 per gallon if ordered 500 gallons at a time. Prices in the Midwest are always less than in California. Prices for home delivery always go up near the end of August or the first few days of September when people start ordering their home tanks to be filled.

<text>The Precambrian ( ; or pre-Cambrian, sometimes abbreviated pC, or Cryptozoic) is the earliest part of Earth&#x27;s history, set before the current Phanerozoic Eon. The Precambrian is so named because it preceded the Cambrian, the first period of the Phanerozoic Eon, which is named after Cambria, the Latinized name for Wales, where rocks from this age were first studied. The Precambrian accounts for 88% of the Earth&#x27;s geologic time.

The Precambrian is an informal unit of geologic time, subdivided into three eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic) of the geologic time scale. It spans from the formation of Earth about 4.6 billion years ago (Ga) to the beginning of the Cambrian Period, about million years ago (Ma), when hard-shelled creatures first appeared in abundance.

==Overview==
Relatively little is known about the Precambrian, despite it making up roughly seven-eighths of the Earth&#x27;s history, and what is known has largely been discovered from the 1960s onwards. The Precambrian fossil record is poorer than that of the succeeding Phanerozoic, and fossils from the Precambrian (e.g. stromatolites) are of limited biostratigraphic use. This is because many Precambrian rocks have been heavily metamorphosed, obscuring their origins, while others have been destroyed by erosion, or remain deeply buried beneath Phanerozoic strata.

It is thought that the Earth coalesced from material in orbit around the Sun at roughly 4,543 Ma, and may have been struck by another planet called Theia shortly after it formed, splitting off material that formed the Moon (see Giant-impact hypothesis). A stable crust was apparently in place by 4,433 Ma, since zircon crystals from Western Australia have been dated at 4,404 ± 8 Ma.

The term &quot;Precambrian&quot; is used by geologists and paleontologists for general discussions not requiring a more specific eon name. However, both the United States Geological Survey and the International Commission on Stratigraphy regard the term as informal. Because the span of time falling under the Precambrian consists of three eons (the Hadean, the Archean, and the Proterozoic), it is sometimes described as a &quot;supereon&quot;, but this is also an informal term, not defined by the ICS in its chronostratigraphic guide.

 (from &quot;earliest&quot;) was a synonym for &quot;pre-Cambrian&quot; and &quot;Precambrian&quot;, or more specifically &quot;Archean&quot;.

==Life forms==

A specific date for the origin of life has not been determined. Carbon found in 3.8 billion-year-old rocks (Archean Eon) from islands off western Greenland may be of organic origin. Well-preserved microscopic fossils of bacteria older than 3.46 billion years have been found in Western Australia. Probable fossils 100 million years older have been found in the same area. However, there is evidence that life could have evolved over 4.280 billion years ago. There is a fairly solid record of bacterial life throughout the remainder (Proterozoic Eon) of the Precambrian.

Complex multicellular organisms may have appeared as early as 2100 Ma. However, the interpretation of ancient fossils is problematic, and &quot;... some definitions of multicellularity encompass everything from simple bacterial colonies to badgers.&quot; Other possible early complex multicellular organisms include a possible 2450 Ma red alga from the Kola Peninsula, 1650 Ma carbonaceous biosignatures in north China, the 1600 Ma &quot;Rafatazmia&quot;, and a possible 1047 Ma &quot;Bangiomorpha&quot; red alga from the Canadian Arctic. The earliest fossils widely accepted as complex multicellular organisms date from the Ediacaran Period. A very diverse collection of soft-bodied forms is found in a variety of locations worldwide and date to between 635 and 542 Ma. These are referred to as Ediacaran or Vendian biota. Hard-shelled creatures appeared toward the end of that time span, marking the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon. By the middle of the following Cambrian Period, a very diverse fauna is recorded in the Burgess Shale, including some which may represent stem groups of modern taxa. The increase in diversity of lifeforms during the early Cambrian is called the Cambrian explosion of life.

While land seems to have been devoid of plants and animals, cyanobacteria and other microbes formed prokaryotic mats that covered terrestrial areas.

Tracks from an animal with leg-like appendages have been found in what was mud 551 million years ago.

===Emergence of life===

The RNA world hypothesis asserts that RNA evolved before coded proteins and DNA genomes. During the Hadean Eon (4,567–4,031 Ma) abundant geothermal microenvironments were present that may have had the potential to support the synthesis and replication of RNA and thus possibly the evolution of a primitive life form. It was shown that porous rock systems comprising heated air-water interfaces could allow ribozyme-catalyzed RNA replication of sense and antisense strands that could be followed by strand-dissociation, thus enabling combined synthesis, release and folding of active ribozymes. This primitive RNA replicative system also may have been able to undergo template strand switching during replication (genetic recombination) as is known to occur during the RNA replication of extant coronaviruses.

==Planetary environment and the oxygen catastrophe==
Evidence of the details of plate motions and other tectonic activity in the Precambrian is difficult to interpret. It is generally believed that small proto-continents existed before 4280 Ma, and that most of the Earth&#x27;s landmasses collected into a single supercontinent around 1130 Ma. The supercontinent, known as Rodinia, broke up around 750 Ma. A number of glacial periods have been identified going as far back as the Huronian epoch, roughly 2400–2100 Ma. One of the best studied is the Sturtian-Varangian glaciation, around 850–635 Ma, which may have brought glacial conditions all the way to the equator, resulting in a &quot;Snowball Earth&quot;.

The atmosphere of the early Earth is not well understood. Most geologists believe it was composed primarily of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other relatively inert gases, and was lacking in free oxygen. There is, however, evidence that an oxygen-rich atmosphere existed since the early Archean.

At present, it is still believed that molecular oxygen was not a significant fraction of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere until after photosynthetic life forms evolved and began to produce it in large quantities as a byproduct of their metabolism. This radical shift from a chemically inert to an oxidizing atmosphere caused an ecological crisis, sometimes called the oxygen catastrophe. At first, oxygen would have quickly combined with other elements in Earth&#x27;s crust, primarily iron, removing it from the atmosphere. After the supply of oxidizable surfaces ran out, oxygen would have begun to accumulate in the atmosphere, and the modern high-oxygen atmosphere would have developed. Evidence for this lies in older rocks that contain massive banded iron formations that were laid down as iron oxides.

==Subdivisions==
A terminology has evolved covering the early years of the Earth&#x27;s existence, as radiometric dating has allowed absolute dates to be assigned to specific formations and features. The Precambrian is divided into three eons: the Hadean (– Ma), Archean (- Ma) and Proterozoic (- Ma). See Timetable of the Precambrian.
* Proterozoic: this eon refers to the time from the lower Cambrian boundary, Ma, back through Ma. As originally used, it was a synonym for &quot;Precambrian&quot; and hence included everything prior to the Cambrian boundary. The Proterozoic Eon is divided into three eras: the Neoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic.
** Neoproterozoic: The youngest geologic era of the Proterozoic Eon, from the Cambrian Period lower boundary ( Ma) back to Ma. The Neoproterozoic corresponds to Precambrian Z rocks of older North American stratigraphy.
*** Ediacaran: The youngest geologic period within the Neoproterozoic Era. The &quot;2012 Geologic Time Scale&quot; dates it from to Ma. In this period the Ediacaran biota appeared.
*** Cryogenian: The middle period in the Neoproterozoic Era: - Ma.
*** Tonian: the earliest period of the Neoproterozoic Era: - Ma.
** Mesoproterozoic: the middle era of the Proterozoic Eon, - Ma. Corresponds to &quot;Precambrian Y&quot; rocks of older North American stratigraphy.
** Paleoproterozoic: oldest era of the Proterozoic Eon, - Ma. Corresponds to &quot;Precambrian X&quot; rocks of older North American stratigraphy.
* Archean Eon: - Ma.
* Hadean Eon: – Ma. This term was intended originally to cover the time before any preserved rocks were deposited, although some zircon crystals from about 4400 Ma demonstrate the existence of crust in the Hadean Eon. Other records from Hadean time come from the Moon and meteorites.
It has been proposed that the Precambrian should be divided into eons and eras that reflect stages of planetary evolution, rather than the current scheme based upon numerical ages. Such a system could rely on events in the stratigraphic record and be demarcated by GSSPs. The Precambrian could be divided into five &quot;natural&quot; eons, characterized as follows:
# Accretion and differentiation: a period of planetary formation until giant Moon-forming impact event.
# Hadean: dominated by heavy bombardment from about 4.51 Ga (possibly including a cool early Earth period) to the end of the Late Heavy Bombardment period.
# Archean: a period defined by the first crustal formations (the Isua greenstone belt) until the deposition of banded iron formations due to increasing atmospheric oxygen content.
# Transition: a period of continued banded iron formation until the first continental red beds.
# Proterozoic: a period of modern plate tectonics until the first animals.

==Precambrian supercontinents==
The movement of Earth&#x27;s plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent containing most or all of the landmass. The earliest known supercontinent was Vaalbara. It formed from proto-continents and was a supercontinent 3.636 billion years ago. Vaalbara broke up c. 2.845–2.803 Ga ago. The supercontinent Kenorland was formed c. 2.72 Ga ago and then broke sometime after 2.45–2.1 Ga into the proto-continent cratons called Laurentia, Baltica, Yilgarn craton and Kalahari. The supercontinent Columbia, or Nuna, formed 2.1–1.8 billion years ago and broke up about 1.3–1.2 billion years ago. The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1300-900 Ma, to have included most or all of Earth&#x27;s continents and to have broken up into eight continents around 750–600 million years ago.

<text>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method widely used to make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample rapidly, allowing scientists to amplify a very small sample of DNA (or a part of it) sufficiently to enable detailed study. PCR was invented in 1983 by American biochemist Kary Mullis at Cetus Corporation. Mullis and biochemist Michael Smith, who had developed other essential ways of manipulating DNA, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993.

PCR is fundamental to many of the procedures used in genetic testing and research, including analysis of ancient samples of DNA and identification of infectious agents. Using PCR, copies of very small amounts of DNA sequences are exponentially amplified in a series of cycles of temperature changes. PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in medical laboratory research for a broad variety of applications including biomedical research and forensic science.

The majority of PCR methods rely on thermal cycling. Thermal cycling exposes reagents to repeated cycles of heating and cooling to permit different temperature-dependent reactions—specifically, DNA melting and enzyme-driven DNA replication. PCR employs two main reagents—primers (which are short single strand DNA fragments known as oligonucleotides that are a complementary sequence to the target DNA region) and a thermostable DNA polymerase. In the first step of PCR, the two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called nucleic acid denaturation. In the second step, the temperature is lowered and the primers bind to the complementary sequences of DNA. The two DNA strands then become templates for DNA polymerase to enzymatically assemble a new DNA strand from free nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a chain reaction in which the original DNA template is exponentially amplified.

Almost all PCR applications employ a heat-stable DNA polymerase, such as &quot;Taq&quot; polymerase, an enzyme originally isolated from the thermophilic bacterium &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot;. If the polymerase used was heat-susceptible, it would denature under the high temperatures of the denaturation step. Before the use of &quot;Taq&quot; polymerase, DNA polymerase had to be manually added every cycle, which was a tedious and costly process.

Applications of the technique include DNA cloning for sequencing, gene cloning and manipulation, gene mutagenesis; construction of DNA-based phylogenies, or functional analysis of genes; diagnosis and monitoring of genetic disorders; amplification of ancient DNA; analysis of genetic fingerprints for DNA profiling (for example, in forensic science and parentage testing); and detection of pathogens in nucleic acid tests for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.

==Principles==
PCR amplifies a specific region of a DNA strand (the DNA target). Most PCR methods amplify DNA fragments of between 0.1 and 10 kilo base pairs (kbp) in length, although some techniques allow for amplification of fragments up to 40 kbp. The amount of amplified product is determined by the available substrates in the reaction, which becomes limiting as the reaction progresses.

A basic PCR set-up requires several components and reagents, including:
* a &quot;DNA template&quot; that contains the DNA target region to amplify
* a &quot;DNA polymerase&quot;; an enzyme that polymerizes new DNA strands; heat-resistant &quot;Taq&quot; polymerase is especially common, as it is more likely to remain intact during the high-temperature DNA denaturation process
* two DNA &quot;primers&quot; that are complementary to the 3&#x27; (three prime) ends of each of the sense and anti-sense strands of the DNA target (DNA polymerase can only bind to and elongate from a double-stranded region of DNA; without primers, there is no double-stranded initiation site at which the polymerase can bind); specific primers that are complementary to the DNA target region are selected beforehand, and are often custom-made in a laboratory or purchased from commercial biochemical suppliers
* &quot;deoxynucleoside triphosphates&quot;, or dNTPs (sometimes called &quot;deoxynucleotide triphosphates&quot;; nucleotides containing triphosphate groups), the building blocks from which the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand
* a &quot;buffer solution&quot; providing a suitable chemical environment for optimum activity and stability of the DNA polymerase
* &quot;bivalent cations&quot;, typically magnesium (Mg) or manganese (Mn) ions; Mg2+ is the most common, but Mn2+ can be used for PCR-mediated DNA mutagenesis, as a higher Mn2+ concentration increases the error rate during DNA synthesis; and &quot;monovalent cations&quot;, typically potassium (K) ions

The reaction is commonly carried out in a volume of 10–200 μL in small reaction tubes (0.2–0.5 mL volumes) in a thermal cycler. The thermal cycler heats and cools the reaction tubes to achieve the temperatures required at each step of the reaction (see below). Many modern thermal cyclers make use of a Peltier device, which permits both heating and cooling of the block holding the PCR tubes simply by reversing the device&#x27;s electric current. Thin-walled reaction tubes permit favorable thermal conductivity to allow for rapid thermal equilibrium. Most thermal cyclers have heated lids to prevent condensation at the top of the reaction tube. Older thermal cyclers lacking a heated lid require a layer of oil on top of the reaction mixture or a ball of wax inside the tube.

===Procedure===
Typically, PCR consists of a series of 20–40 repeated temperature changes, called thermal cycles, with each cycle commonly consisting of two or three discrete temperature steps (see figure below). The cycling is often preceded by a single temperature step at a very high temperature (&gt;), and followed by one hold at the end for final product extension or brief storage. The temperatures used and the length of time they are applied in each cycle depend on a variety of parameters, including the enzyme used for DNA synthesis, the concentration of bivalent ions and dNTPs in the reaction, and the melting temperature (&quot;Tm&quot;) of the primers. The individual steps common to most PCR methods are as follows:
* &quot;Initialization&quot;: This step is only required for DNA polymerases that require heat activation by hot-start PCR. It consists of heating the reaction chamber to a temperature of , or if extremely thermostable polymerases are used, which is then held for 1–10 minutes.
* &quot;Denaturation&quot;: This step is the first regular cycling event and consists of heating the reaction chamber to for 20–30 seconds. This causes DNA melting, or denaturation, of the double-stranded DNA template by breaking the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, yielding two single-stranded DNA molecules.
* &quot;Annealing&quot;: In the next step, the reaction temperature is lowered to for 20–40 seconds, allowing annealing of the primers to each of the single-stranded DNA templates. Two different primers are typically included in the reaction mixture: one for each of the two single-stranded complements containing the target region. The primers are single-stranded sequences themselves, but are much shorter than the length of the target region, complementing only very short sequences at the 3&#x27; end of each strand.

: It is critical to determine a proper temperature for the annealing step because efficiency and specificity are strongly affected by the annealing temperature. This temperature must be low enough to allow for hybridization of the primer to the strand, but high enough for the hybridization to be specific, i.e., the primer should bind &quot;only&quot; to a perfectly complementary part of the strand, and nowhere else. If the temperature is too low, the primer may bind imperfectly. If it is too high, the primer may not bind at all. A typical annealing temperature is about 3–5 °C below the &quot;Tm&quot; of the primers used. Stable hydrogen bonds between complementary bases are formed only when the primer sequence very closely matches the template sequence. During this step, the polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA formation.
* &quot;Extension/elongation&quot;: The temperature at this step depends on the DNA polymerase used; the optimum activity temperature for the thermostable DNA polymerase of &quot;Taq&quot; polymerase is approximately , though a temperature of is commonly used with this enzyme. In this step, the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the DNA template strand by adding free dNTPs from the reaction mixture that is complementary to the template in the 5&#x27;-to-3&#x27; direction, condensing the 5&#x27;-phosphate group of the dNTPs with the 3&#x27;-hydroxy group at the end of the nascent (elongating) DNA strand. The precise time required for elongation depends both on the DNA polymerase used and on the length of the DNA target region to amplify. As a rule of thumb, at their optimal temperature, most DNA polymerases polymerize a thousand bases per minute. Under optimal conditions (i.e., if there are no limitations due to limiting substrates or reagents), at each extension/elongation step, the number of DNA target sequences is doubled. With each successive cycle, the original template strands plus all newly generated strands become template strands for the next round of elongation, leading to exponential (geometric) amplification of the specific DNA target region.

: The processes of denaturation, annealing and elongation constitute a single cycle. Multiple cycles are required to amplify the DNA target to millions of copies. The formula used to calculate the number of DNA copies formed after a given number of cycles is 2n, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of cycles. Thus, a reaction set for 30 cycles results in 230, or copies of the original double-stranded DNA target region.
* &quot;Final elongation&quot;: This single step is optional, but is performed at a temperature of (the temperature range required for optimal activity of most polymerases used in PCR) for 5–15 minutes after the last PCR cycle to ensure that any remaining single-stranded DNA is fully elongated.
* &quot;Final hold&quot;: The final step cools the reaction chamber to for an indefinite time, and may be employed for short-term storage of the PCR products.

To check whether the PCR successfully generated the anticipated DNA target region (also sometimes referred to as the amplimer or amplicon), agarose gel electrophoresis may be employed for size separation of the PCR products. The size of the PCR products is determined by comparison with a DNA ladder, a molecular weight marker which contains DNA fragments of known sizes, which runs on the gel alongside the PCR products.
===Stages===

As with other chemical reactions, the reaction rate and efficiency of PCR are affected by limiting factors. Thus, the entire PCR process can further be divided into three stages based on reaction progress:
* &quot;Exponential amplification&quot;: At every cycle, the amount of product is doubled (assuming 100% reaction efficiency). After 30 cycles, a single copy of DNA can be increased up to 1,000,000,000 (one billion) copies. In a sense, then, the replication of a discrete strand of DNA is being manipulated in a tube under controlled conditions. The reaction is very sensitive: only minute quantities of DNA must be present.
* &quot;Leveling off stage&quot;: The reaction slows as the DNA polymerase loses activity and as consumption of reagents, such as dNTPs and primers, causes them to become more limited.
* &quot;Plateau&quot;: No more product accumulates due to exhaustion of reagents and enzyme.

==Optimization==

In practice, PCR can fail for various reasons, such as sensitivity or contamination. Contamination with extraneous DNA can lead to spurious products and is addressed with lab protocols and procedures that separate pre-PCR mixtures from potential DNA contaminants. For instance, if DNA from a crime scene is analyzed, a single DNA molecule from lab personnel could be amplified and misguide the investigation. Hence the PCR-setup areas is separated from the analysis or purification of other PCR products, disposable plasticware used, and the work surface between reaction setups needs to be thoroughly cleaned.

Specificity can be adjusted by experimental conditions so that no spurious products are generated. Primer-design techniques are important in improving PCR product yield and in avoiding the formation of unspecific products. The usage of alternate buffer components or polymerase enzymes can help with amplification of long or otherwise problematic regions of DNA. For instance, Q5 polymerase is said to be ≈280 times less error-prone than Taq polymerase. Both the running parameters (e.g. temperature and duration of cycles), or the addition of reagents, such as formamide, may increase the specificity and yield of PCR. Computer simulations of theoretical PCR results (Electronic PCR) may be performed to assist in primer design.

==Applications==

===Selective DNA isolation===
PCR allows isolation of DNA fragments from genomic DNA by selective amplification of a specific region of DNA. This use of PCR augments many ways, such as generating hybridization probes for Southern or northern hybridization and DNA cloning, which require larger amounts of DNA, representing a specific DNA region. PCR supplies these techniques with high amounts of pure DNA, enabling analysis of DNA samples even from very small amounts of starting material.

Other applications of PCR include DNA sequencing to determine unknown PCR-amplified sequences in which one of the amplification primers may be used in Sanger sequencing, isolation of a DNA sequence to expedite recombinant DNA technologies involving the insertion of a DNA sequence into a plasmid, phage, or cosmid (depending on size) or the genetic material of another organism. Bacterial colonies &quot;(such as E. coli)&quot; can be rapidly screened by PCR for correct DNA vector constructs. PCR may also be used for genetic fingerprinting; a forensic technique used to identify a person or organism by comparing experimental DNAs through different PCR-based methods.

Some PCR fingerprint methods have high discriminative power and can be used to identify genetic relationships between individuals, such as parent-child or between siblings, and are used in paternity testing (Fig. 4). This technique may also be used to determine evolutionary relationships among organisms when certain molecular clocks are used (i.e. the 16S rRNA and recA genes of microorganisms).

===Amplification and quantification of DNA===
Because PCR amplifies the regions of DNA that it targets, PCR can be used to analyze extremely small amounts of sample. This is often critical for forensic analysis, when only a trace amount of DNA is available as evidence. PCR may also be used in the analysis of ancient DNA that is tens of thousands of years old. These PCR-based techniques have been successfully used on animals, such as a forty-thousand-year-old mammoth, and also on human DNA, in applications ranging from the analysis of Egyptian mummies to the identification of a Russian tsar and the body of English king Richard III.

Quantitative PCR or Real Time PCR (qPCR, not to be confused with RT-PCR) methods allow the estimation of the amount of a given sequence present in a sample—a technique often applied to quantitatively determine levels of gene expression. Quantitative PCR is an established tool for DNA quantification that measures the accumulation of DNA product after each round of PCR amplification.

qPCR allows the quantification and detection of a specific DNA sequence in real time since it measures concentration while the synthesis process is taking place. There are two methods for simultaneous detection and quantification. The first method consists of using fluorescent dyes that are retained nonspecifically in between the double strands. The second method involves probes that code for specific sequences and are fluorescently labeled. Detection of DNA using these methods can only be seen after the hybridization of probes with its complementary DNA (cDNA) takes place. An interesting technique combination is real-time PCR and reverse transcription. This sophisticated technique, called RT-qPCR, allows for the quantification of a small quantity of RNA. Through this combined technique, mRNA is converted to cDNA, which is further quantified using qPCR. This technique lowers the possibility of error at the end point of PCR, increasing chances for detection of genes associated with genetic diseases such as cancer. Laboratories use RT-qPCR for the purpose of sensitively measuring gene regulation. The mathematical foundations for the reliable quantification of the PCR and RT-qPCR facilitate the implementation of accurate fitting procedures of experimental data in research, medical, diagnostic and infectious disease applications.

===Medical and diagnostic applications===
Prospective parents can be tested for being genetic carriers, or their children might be tested for actually being affected by a disease. DNA samples for prenatal testing can be obtained by amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, or even by the analysis of rare fetal cells circulating in the mother&#x27;s bloodstream. PCR analysis is also essential to preimplantation genetic diagnosis, where individual cells of a developing embryo are tested for mutations.
* PCR can also be used as part of a sensitive test for &quot;tissue typing&quot;, vital to organ transplantation. there is even a proposal to replace the traditional antibody-based tests for blood type with PCR-based tests.
* Many forms of cancer involve alterations to &quot;oncogenes&quot;. By using PCR-based tests to study these mutations, therapy regimens can sometimes be individually customized to a patient. PCR permits early diagnosis of malignant diseases such as leukemia and lymphomas, which is currently the highest-developed in cancer research and is already being used routinely. PCR assays can be performed directly on genomic DNA samples to detect translocation-specific malignant cells at a sensitivity that is at least 10,000 fold higher than that of other methods. PCR is very useful in the medical field since it allows for the isolation and amplification of tumor suppressors. Quantitative PCR for example, can be used to quantify and analyze single cells, as well as recognize DNA, mRNA and protein confirmations and combinations.

===Infectious disease applications===
PCR allows for rapid and highly specific diagnosis of infectious diseases, including those caused by bacteria or viruses. PCR also permits identification of non-cultivatable or slow-growing microorganisms such as mycobacteria, anaerobic bacteria, or viruses from tissue culture assays and animal models. The basis for PCR diagnostic applications in microbiology is the detection of infectious agents and the discrimination of non-pathogenic from pathogenic strains by virtue of specific genes.

Characterization and detection of infectious disease organisms have been revolutionized by PCR in the following ways:
* The &quot;human immunodeficiency virus&quot; (or &quot;HIV&quot;), is a difficult target to find and eradicate. The earliest tests for infection relied on the presence of antibodies to the virus circulating in the bloodstream. However, antibodies don&#x27;t appear until many weeks after infection, maternal antibodies mask the infection of a newborn, and therapeutic agents to fight the infection don&#x27;t affect the antibodies. PCR tests have been developed that can detect as little as one viral genome among the DNA of over 50,000 host cells. Infections can be detected earlier, donated blood can be screened directly for the virus, newborns can be immediately tested for infection, and the effects of antiviral treatments can be quantified.
* Some disease organisms, such as that for &quot;tuberculosis&quot;, are difficult to sample from patients and slow to be grown in the laboratory. PCR-based tests have allowed detection of small numbers of disease organisms (both live or dead), in convenient samples. Detailed genetic analysis can also be used to detect antibiotic resistance, allowing immediate and effective therapy. The effects of therapy can also be immediately evaluated.
* The spread of a disease organism through populations of domestic or wild animals can be monitored by PCR testing. In many cases, the appearance of new virulent sub-types can be detected and monitored. The sub-types of an organism that were responsible for earlier epidemics can also be determined by PCR analysis.
* Viral DNA can be detected by PCR. The primers used must be specific to the targeted sequences in the DNA of a virus, and PCR can be used for diagnostic analyses or DNA sequencing of the viral genome. The high sensitivity of PCR permits virus detection soon after infection and even before the onset of disease. Such early detection may give physicians a significant lead time in treatment. The amount of virus (&quot;viral load&quot;) in a patient can also be quantified by PCR-based DNA quantitation techniques (see below). A variant of PCR (RT-PCR) is used for detecting viral RNA rather than DNA: in this test the enzyme reverse transcriptase is used to generate a DNA sequence which matches the viral RNA; this DNA is then amplified as per the usual PCR method. RT-PCR is widely used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome.
* Diseases such as pertussis (or whooping cough) are caused by the bacteria &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;. This bacteria is marked by a serious acute respiratory infection that affects various animals and humans and has led to the deaths of many young children. The pertussis toxin is a protein exotoxin that binds to cell receptors by two dimers and reacts with different cell types such as T lymphocytes which play a role in cell immunity. PCR is an important testing tool that can detect sequences within the gene for the pertussis toxin. Because PCR has a high sensitivity for the toxin and a rapid turnaround time, it is very efficient for diagnosing pertussis when compared to culture.

===Forensic applications===
The development of PCR-based genetic (or DNA) fingerprinting protocols has seen widespread application in forensics:
* In its most discriminating form, &quot;genetic fingerprinting&quot; can uniquely discriminate any one person from the entire population of the world. Minute samples of DNA can be isolated from a crime scene, and compared to that from suspects, or from a DNA database of earlier evidence or convicts. Simpler versions of these tests are often used to rapidly rule out suspects during a criminal investigation. Evidence from decades-old crimes can be tested, confirming or exonerating the people originally convicted.
* Forensic DNA typing has been an effective way of identifying or exonerating criminal suspects due to analysis of evidence discovered at a crime scene. The human genome has many repetitive regions that can be found within gene sequences or in non-coding regions of the genome. Specifically, up to 40% of human DNA is repetitive. There are two distinct categories for these repetitive, non-coding regions in the genome. The first category is called variable number tandem repeats (VNTR), which are 10–100 base pairs long and the second category is called short tandem repeats (STR) and these consist of repeated 2–10 base pair sections. PCR is used to amplify several well-known VNTRs and STRs using primers that flank each of the repetitive regions. The sizes of the fragments obtained from any individual for each of the STRs will indicate which alleles are present. By analyzing several STRs for an individual, a set of alleles for each person will be found that statistically is likely to be unique. Researchers have identified the complete sequence of the human genome. This sequence can be easily accessed through the NCBI website and is used in many real-life applications. For example, the FBI has compiled a set of DNA marker sites used for identification, and these are called the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) DNA database. Using this database enables statistical analysis to be used to determine the probability that a DNA sample will match. PCR is a very powerful and significant analytical tool to use for forensic DNA typing because researchers only need a very small amount of the target DNA to be used for analysis. For example, a single human hair with attached hair follicle has enough DNA to conduct the analysis. Similarly, a few sperm, skin samples from under the fingernails, or a small amount of blood can provide enough DNA for conclusive analysis.
* Less discriminating forms of DNA fingerprinting can help in &quot;DNA paternity testing&quot;, where an individual is matched with their close relatives. DNA from unidentified human remains can be tested, and compared with that from possible parents, siblings, or children. Similar testing can be used to confirm the biological parents of an adopted (or kidnapped) child. The actual biological father of a newborn can also be confirmed (or ruled out).
* The PCR AMGX/AMGY design facilitate in amplifying DNA sequences from a very minuscule amount of genome. However it can also be used for real-time sex determination from forensic bone samples. This provides a powerful and effective way to determine gender in forensic cases and ancient specimens.

===Research applications===
PCR has been applied to many areas of research in molecular genetics:
* PCR allows rapid production of short pieces of DNA, even when not more than the sequence of the two primers is known. This ability of PCR augments many methods, such as generating &quot;hybridization probes&quot; for Southern or northern blot hybridization. PCR supplies these techniques with large amounts of pure DNA, sometimes as a single strand, enabling analysis even from very small amounts of starting material.
* The task of &quot;DNA sequencing&quot; can also be assisted by PCR. Known segments of DNA can easily be produced from a patient with a genetic disease mutation. Modifications to the amplification technique can extract segments from a completely unknown genome, or can generate just a single strand of an area of interest.
* PCR has numerous applications to the more traditional process of &quot;DNA cloning&quot;. It can extract segments for insertion into a vector from a larger genome, which may be only available in small quantities. Using a single set of &#x27;vector primers&#x27;, it can also analyze or extract fragments that have already been inserted into vectors. Some alterations to the PCR protocol can &quot;generate mutations&quot; (general or site-directed) of an inserted fragment.
* &quot;Sequence-tagged sites&quot; is a process where PCR is used as an indicator that a particular segment of a genome is present in a particular clone. The Human Genome Project found this application vital to mapping the cosmid clones they were sequencing, and to coordinating the results from different laboratories.
* An application of PCR is the phylogenic analysis of DNA from &quot;ancient sources&quot;, such as that found in the recovered bones of Neanderthals, from frozen tissues of mammoths, or from the brain of Egyptian mummies. In some cases the highly degraded DNA from these sources might be reassembled during the early stages of amplification.
* A common application of PCR is the study of patterns of &quot;gene expression&quot;. Tissues (or even individual cells) can be analyzed at different stages to see which genes have become active, or which have been switched off. This application can also use quantitative PCR to quantitate the actual levels of expression
* The ability of PCR to simultaneously amplify several loci from individual sperm has greatly enhanced the more traditional task of &quot;genetic mapping&quot; by studying chromosomal crossovers after meiosis. Rare crossover events between very close loci have been directly observed by analyzing thousands of individual sperms. Similarly, unusual deletions, insertions, translocations, or inversions can be analyzed, all without having to wait (or pay) for the long and laborious processes of fertilization, embryogenesis, etc.
* Site-directed mutagenesis: PCR can be used to create mutant genes with mutations chosen by scientists at will. These mutations can be chosen in order to understand how proteins accomplish their functions, and to change or improve protein function.

== Advantages ==
PCR has a number of advantages. It is fairly simple to understand and to use, and produces results rapidly. The technique is highly sensitive with the potential to produce millions to billions of copies of a specific product for sequencing, cloning, and analysis. qRT-PCR shares the same advantages as the PCR, with an added advantage of quantification of the synthesized product. Therefore, it has its uses to analyze alterations of gene expression levels in tumors, microbes, or other disease states.

PCR is a very powerful and practical research tool. The sequencing of unknown etiologies of many diseases are being figured out by the PCR. The technique can help identify the sequence of previously unknown viruses related to those already known and thus give us a better understanding of the disease itself. If the procedure can be further simplified and sensitive non-radiometric detection systems can be developed, the PCR will assume a prominent place in the clinical laboratory for years to come.

==Limitations==
One major limitation of PCR is that prior information about the target sequence is necessary in order to generate the primers that will allow its selective amplification. This means that, typically, PCR users must know the precise sequence(s) upstream of the target region on each of the two single-stranded templates in order to ensure that the DNA polymerase properly binds to the primer-template hybrids and subsequently generates the entire target region during DNA synthesis.

Like all enzymes, DNA polymerases are also prone to error, which in turn causes mutations in the PCR fragments that are generated.

Another limitation of PCR is that even the smallest amount of contaminating DNA can be amplified, resulting in misleading or ambiguous results. To minimize the chance of contamination, investigators should reserve separate rooms for reagent preparation, the PCR, and analysis of product. Reagents should be dispensed into single-use aliquots. Pipettors with disposable plungers and extra-long pipette tips should be routinely used. It is moreover recommended to ensure that the lab set-up follows a unidirectional workflow. No materials or reagents used in the PCR and analysis rooms should ever be taken into the PCR preparation room without thorough decontamination.

Environmental samples that contain humic acids may inhibit PCR amplification and lead to inaccurate results.

==Variations==

* &quot;Allele-specific PCR&quot; or &quot;The amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)&quot;: a diagnostic or cloning technique based on single-nucleotide variations (SNVs not to be confused with SNPs) (single-base differences in a patient). Any mutation involving single base change can be detected by this system. It requires prior knowledge of a DNA sequence, including differences between alleles, and uses primers whose 3&#x27; ends encompass the SNV (base pair buffer around SNV usually incorporated). PCR amplification under stringent conditions is much less efficient in the presence of a mismatch between template and primer, so successful amplification with an SNP-specific primer signals presence of the specific SNP or small deletions in a sequence. See SNP genotyping for more information.
* &quot;Assembly PCR&quot; or &quot;Polymerase Cycling Assembly (PCA)&quot;: artificial synthesis of long DNA sequences by performing PCR on a pool of long oligonucleotides with short overlapping segments. The oligonucleotides alternate between sense and antisense directions, and the overlapping segments determine the order of the PCR fragments, thereby selectively producing the final long DNA product.
* &quot;Asymmetric PCR&quot;: preferentially amplifies one DNA strand in a double-stranded DNA template. It is used in sequencing and hybridization probing where amplification of only one of the two complementary strands is required. PCR is carried out as usual, but with a great excess of the primer for the strand targeted for amplification. Because of the slow (arithmetic) amplification later in the reaction after the limiting primer has been used up, extra cycles of PCR are required. A recent modification on this process, known as &quot;L&quot;inear-&quot;A&quot;fter-&quot;T&quot;he-&quot;E&quot;xponential-PCR (LATE-PCR), uses a limiting primer with a higher melting temperature (Tm) than the excess primer to maintain reaction efficiency as the limiting primer concentration decreases mid-reaction.
* &quot;Convective PCR&quot;: a pseudo-isothermal way of performing PCR. Instead of repeatedly heating and cooling the PCR mixture, the solution is subjected to a thermal gradient. The resulting thermal instability driven convective flow automatically shuffles the PCR reagents from the hot and cold regions repeatedly enabling PCR. Parameters such as thermal boundary conditions and geometry of the PCR enclosure can be optimized to yield robust and rapid PCR by harnessing the emergence of chaotic flow fields. Such convective flow PCR setup significantly reduces device power requirement and operation time.
* &quot;Dial-out PCR&quot;: a highly parallel method for retrieving accurate DNA molecules for gene synthesis. A complex library of DNA molecules is modified with unique flanking tags before massively parallel sequencing. Tag-directed primers then enable the retrieval of molecules with desired sequences by PCR.
* &quot;Digital PCR (dPCR)&quot;: used to measure the quantity of a target DNA sequence in a DNA sample. The DNA sample is highly diluted so that after running many PCRs in parallel, some of them do not receive a single molecule of the target DNA. The target DNA concentration is calculated using the proportion of negative outcomes. Hence the name &#x27;digital PCR&#x27;.
* &quot;Helicase-dependent amplification&quot;: similar to traditional PCR, but uses a constant temperature rather than cycling through denaturation and annealing/extension cycles. DNA helicase, an enzyme that unwinds DNA, is used in place of thermal denaturation.
* &quot;Hot start PCR&quot;: a technique that reduces non-specific amplification during the initial set up stages of the PCR. It may be performed manually by heating the reaction components to the denaturation temperature (e.g., 95 °C) before adding the polymerase. Specialized enzyme systems have been developed that inhibit the polymerase&#x27;s activity at ambient temperature, either by the binding of an antibody or by the presence of covalently bound inhibitors that dissociate only after a high-temperature activation step. Hot-start/cold-finish PCR is achieved with new hybrid polymerases that are inactive at ambient temperature and are instantly activated at elongation temperature.
* &quot;In silico PCR&quot; (digital PCR, virtual PCR, electronic PCR, e-PCR) refers to computational tools used to calculate theoretical polymerase chain reaction results using a given set of primers (probes) to amplify DNA sequences from a sequenced genome or transcriptome. In silico PCR was proposed as an educational tool for molecular biology.
* &quot;Intersequence-specific PCR&quot; (ISSR): a PCR method for DNA fingerprinting that amplifies regions between simple sequence repeats to produce a unique fingerprint of amplified fragment lengths.
* &quot;Inverse PCR&quot;: is commonly used to identify the flanking sequences around genomic inserts. It involves a series of DNA digestions and self ligation, resulting in known sequences at either end of the unknown sequence.
* &quot;Ligation-mediated PCR&quot;: uses small DNA linkers ligated to the DNA of interest and multiple primers annealing to the DNA linkers; it has been used for DNA sequencing, genome walking, and DNA footprinting.
* &quot;Methylation-specific PCR&quot; (MSP): developed by Stephen Baylin and James G. Herman at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and is used to detect methylation of CpG islands in genomic DNA. DNA is first treated with sodium bisulfite, which converts unmethylated cytosine bases to uracil, which is recognized by PCR primers as thymine. Two PCRs are then carried out on the modified DNA, using primer sets identical except at any CpG islands within the primer sequences. At these points, one primer set recognizes DNA with cytosines to amplify methylated DNA, and one set recognizes DNA with uracil or thymine to amplify unmethylated DNA. MSP using qPCR can also be performed to obtain quantitative rather than qualitative information about methylation.
* &quot;Miniprimer PCR&quot;: uses a thermostable polymerase (S-Tbr) that can extend from short primers (&quot;smalligos&quot;) as short as 9 or 10 nucleotides. This method permits PCR targeting to smaller primer binding regions, and is used to amplify conserved DNA sequences, such as the 16S (or eukaryotic 18S) rRNA gene.
* &quot;Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification&quot; (&quot;MLPA&quot;): permits amplifying multiple targets with a single primer pair, thus avoiding the resolution limitations of multiplex PCR (see below).
* &quot;Multiplex-PCR&quot;: consists of multiple primer sets within a single PCR mixture to produce amplicons of varying sizes that are specific to different DNA sequences. By targeting multiple genes at once, additional information may be gained from a single test-run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform. Annealing temperatures for each of the primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and amplicon sizes. That is, their base pair length should be different enough to form distinct bands when visualized by gel electrophoresis.
* &quot;Nanoparticle-assisted PCR (nanoPCR)&quot;: some nanoparticles (NPs) can enhance the efficiency of PCR (thus being called nanoPCR), and some can even outperform the original PCR enhancers. It was reported that quantum dots (QDs) can improve PCR specificity and efficiency. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are efficient in enhancing the amplification of long PCR. Carbon nanopowder (CNP) can improve the efficiency of repeated PCR and long PCR, while zinc oxide, titanium dioxide and Ag NPs were found to increase the PCR yield. Previous data indicated that non-metallic NPs retained acceptable amplification fidelity. Given that many NPs are capable of enhancing PCR efficiency, it is clear that there is likely to be great potential for nanoPCR technology improvements and product development.
* &quot;Nested PCR&quot;: increases the specificity of DNA amplification, by reducing background due to non-specific amplification of DNA. Two sets of primers are used in two successive PCRs. In the first reaction, one pair of primers is used to generate DNA products, which besides the intended target, may still consist of non-specifically amplified DNA fragments. The product(s) are then used in a second PCR with a set of primers whose binding sites are completely or partially different from and located 3&#x27; of each of the primers used in the first reaction. Nested PCR is often more successful in specifically amplifying long DNA fragments than conventional PCR, but it requires more detailed knowledge of the target sequences.
* &quot;Overlap-extension PCR&quot; or &quot;Splicing by overlap extension (SOEing) &quot;: a genetic engineering technique that is used to splice together two or more DNA fragments that contain complementary sequences. It is used to join DNA pieces containing genes, regulatory sequences, or mutations; the technique enables creation of specific and long DNA constructs. It can also introduce deletions, insertions or point mutations into a DNA sequence.
* &quot;PAN-AC&quot;: uses isothermal conditions for amplification, and may be used in living cells.
* &quot;PAN-PCR&quot;: A computational method for designing bacterium typing assays based on whole genome sequence data.
* &quot;Quantitative PCR&quot; (qPCR): used to measure the quantity of a target sequence (commonly in real-time). It quantitatively measures starting amounts of DNA, cDNA, or RNA. Quantitative PCR is commonly used to determine whether a DNA sequence is present in a sample and the number of its copies in the sample. &quot;Quantitative PCR&quot; has a very high degree of precision. Quantitative PCR methods use fluorescent dyes, such as Sybr Green, EvaGreen or fluorophore-containing DNA probes, such as TaqMan, to measure the amount of amplified product in real time. It is also sometimes abbreviated to RT-PCR (&quot;real-time&quot; PCR) but this abbreviation should be used only for reverse transcription PCR. qPCR is the appropriate contractions for quantitative PCR (real-time PCR).
* &quot;Reverse Complement PCR&quot; (RC-PCR): Allows the addition of functional domains or sequences of choice to be appended independently to either end of the generated amplicon in a single closed tube reaction. This method generates target specific primers within the reaction by the interaction of universal primers (which contain the desired sequences or domains to be appended) and RC probes.
* &quot;Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)&quot;: for amplifying DNA from RNA. Reverse transcriptase reverse transcribes RNA into cDNA, which is then amplified by PCR. RT-PCR is widely used in expression profiling, to determine the expression of a gene or to identify the sequence of an RNA transcript, including transcription start and termination sites. If the genomic DNA sequence of a gene is known, RT-PCR can be used to map the location of exons and introns in the gene. The 5&#x27; end of a gene (corresponding to the transcription start site) is typically identified by RACE-PCR (&quot;Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends&quot;).
* &quot;RNase H-dependent PCR&quot; (rhPCR): a modification of PCR that utilizes primers with a 3&#x27; extension block that can be removed by a thermostable RNase HII enzyme. This system reduces primer-dimers and allows for multiplexed reactions to be performed with higher numbers of primers.
* &quot;Single specific primer-PCR&quot; (SSP-PCR): allows the amplification of double-stranded DNA even when the sequence information is available at one end only. This method permits amplification of genes for which only a partial sequence information is available, and allows unidirectional genome walking from known into unknown regions of the chromosome.
* &quot;Solid Phase PCR&quot;: encompasses multiple meanings, including Polony Amplification (where PCR colonies are derived in a gel matrix, for example), Bridge PCR (primers are covalently linked to a solid-support surface), conventional Solid Phase PCR (where Asymmetric PCR is applied in the presence of solid support bearing primer with sequence matching one of the aqueous primers) and Enhanced Solid Phase PCR (where conventional Solid Phase PCR can be improved by employing high Tm and nested solid support primer with optional application of a thermal &#x27;step&#x27; to favour solid support priming).
* &quot;Suicide PCR&quot;: typically used in paleogenetics or other studies where avoiding false positives and ensuring the specificity of the amplified fragment is the highest priority. It was originally described in a study to verify the presence of the microbe Yersinia pestis in dental samples obtained from 14th Century graves of people supposedly killed by the plague during the medieval Black Death epidemic. The method prescribes the use of any primer combination only once in a PCR (hence the term &quot;suicide&quot;), which should never have been used in any positive control PCR reaction, and the primers should always target a genomic region never amplified before in the lab using this or any other set of primers. This ensures that no contaminating DNA from previous PCR reactions is present in the lab, which could otherwise generate false positives.
* &quot;Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR)&quot;: for isolation of an unknown sequence flanking a known sequence. Within the known sequence, TAIL-PCR uses a nested pair of primers with differing annealing temperatures; a degenerate primer is used to amplify in the other direction from the unknown sequence.
* &quot;Touchdown PCR&quot; (&quot;Step-down PCR&quot;): a variant of PCR that aims to reduce nonspecific background by gradually lowering the annealing temperature as PCR cycling progresses. The annealing temperature at the initial cycles is usually a few degrees (3–5 °C) above the Tm of the primers used, while at the later cycles, it is a few degrees (3–5 °C) below the primer Tm. The higher temperatures give greater specificity for primer binding, and the lower temperatures permit more efficient amplification from the specific products formed during the initial cycles.
* &quot;Universal Fast Walking&quot;: for genome walking and genetic fingerprinting using a more specific &#x27;two-sided&#x27; PCR than conventional &#x27;one-sided&#x27; approaches (using only one gene-specific primer and one general primer—which can lead to artefactual &#x27;noise&#x27;) by virtue of a mechanism involving lariat structure formation. Streamlined derivatives of UFW are LaNe RAGE (lariat-dependent nested PCR for rapid amplification of genomic DNA ends), 5&#x27;RACE LaNe and 3&#x27;RACE LaNe.

==History==

The heat-resistant enzymes that are a key component in polymerase chain reaction were discovered in the 1960s as a product of a microbial life form that lived in the superheated waters of Yellowstone&#x27;s Mushroom Spring.

A 1971 paper in the &quot;Journal of Molecular Biology&quot; by Kjell Kleppe and co-workers in the laboratory of H. Gobind Khorana first described a method of using an enzymatic assay to replicate a short DNA template with primers &quot;in vitro&quot;. However, this early manifestation of the basic PCR principle did not receive much attention at the time and the invention of the polymerase chain reaction in 1983 is generally credited to Kary Mullis.
When Mullis developed the PCR in 1983, he was working in Emeryville, California for Cetus Corporation, one of the first biotechnology companies, where he was responsible for synthesizing short chains of DNA. Mullis has written that he conceived the idea for PCR while cruising along the Pacific Coast Highway one night in his car. He was playing in his mind with a new way of analyzing changes (mutations) in DNA when he realized that he had instead invented a method of amplifying any DNA region through repeated cycles of duplication driven by DNA polymerase. In &quot;Scientific American&quot;, Mullis summarized the procedure: &quot;Beginning with a single molecule of the genetic material DNA, the PCR can generate 100 billion similar molecules in an afternoon. The reaction is easy to execute. It requires no more than a test tube, a few simple reagents, and a source of heat.&quot; DNA fingerprinting was first used for paternity testing in 1988.

Mullis has credited his use of LSD as integral to his development of PCR: &quot;Would I have invented PCR if I hadn&#x27;t taken LSD? I seriously doubt it. I could sit on a DNA molecule and watch the polymers go by. I learnt that partly on psychedelic drugs.&quot;

Mullis and biochemist Michael Smith, who had developed other essential ways of manipulating DNA, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993, seven years after Mullis and his colleagues at Cetus first put his proposal to practice. Mullis&#x27;s 1985 paper with R. K. Saiki and H. A. Erlich, &quot;Enzymatic Amplification of β-globin Genomic Sequences and Restriction Site Analysis for Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Anemia&quot;—the polymerase chain reaction invention (PCR)—was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society in 2017.

At the core of the PCR method is the use of a suitable DNA polymerase able to withstand the high temperatures of &gt; required for separation of the two DNA strands in the DNA double helix after each replication cycle. The DNA polymerases initially employed for in vitro experiments presaging PCR were unable to withstand these high temperatures. So the early procedures for DNA replication were very inefficient and time-consuming, and required large amounts of DNA polymerase and continuous handling throughout the process.

The discovery in 1976 of &quot;Taq&quot; polymerase—a DNA polymerase purified from the thermophilic bacterium, &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot;, which naturally lives in hot () environments such as hot springs—paved the way for dramatic improvements of the PCR method. The DNA polymerase isolated from &quot;T. aquaticus&quot; is stable at high temperatures remaining active even after DNA denaturation, thus obviating the need to add new DNA polymerase after each cycle. This allowed an automated thermocycler-based process for DNA amplification.

===Patent disputes===
The PCR technique was patented by Kary Mullis and assigned to Cetus Corporation, where Mullis worked when he invented the technique in 1983. The &quot;Taq&quot; polymerase enzyme was also covered by patents. There have been several high-profile lawsuits related to the technique, including an unsuccessful lawsuit brought by DuPont. The Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche purchased the rights to the patents in 1992. The last of the commercial PCR patents expired in 2017.

A related patent battle over the &quot;Taq&quot; polymerase enzyme is still ongoing in several jurisdictions around the world between Roche and Promega. The legal arguments have extended beyond the lives of the original PCR and &quot;Taq&quot; polymerase patents, which expired on 28 March 2005.

<text>In biochemistry, a polymerase is an enzyme (EC 2.7.7.6/7/19/48/49) that synthesizes long chains of polymers or nucleic acids. DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase are used to assemble DNA and RNA molecules, respectively, by copying a DNA template strand using base-pairing interactions or RNA by half ladder replication.

A DNA polymerase from the thermophilic bacterium, &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot; (&quot;Taq&quot;) (PDB 1BGX, EC 2.7.7.7) is used in the polymerase chain reaction, an important technique of molecular biology.

A polymerase may be template-dependent or template-independent. Poly-A-polymerase is an example of template independent polymerase. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase also known to have template independent and template dependent activities.

== By function ==

*DNA polymerase (DNA-directed DNA polymerase, DdDP)
**Family A: DNA polymerase I; Pol γ, θ, ν
**Family B: DNA polymerase II; Pol α, δ, ε, ζ
**Family C: DNA polymerase III holoenzyme
**Family X: Pol β, λ, μ
***Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TDT), which lends diversity to antibody heavy chains.
**Family Y: DNA polymerase IV (DinB) and DNA polymerase V (UmuD&#x27;2C) - SOS repair polymerases; Pol η, ι, κ
*Reverse transcriptase (RT; RNA-directed DNA polymerase; RdDP)
** Telomerase
*DNA-directed RNA polymerase (DdRP, RNAP)
**Multi-subunit (msDdRP): RNA polymerase I, RNA polymerase II, RNA polymerase III
**Single-subunit (ssDdRP): T7 RNA polymerase, POLRMT
**Primase, PrimPol
*RNA replicase (RNA-directed RNA polymerase, RdRP)
**Viral (single-subunit)
**Eukaryotic cellular (cRdRP; dual-subunit)
*Template-less RNA elongation
** Polyadenylation: PAP, PNPase
== By structure ==
Polymerases are generally split into two superfamilies, the &quot;right hand&quot; fold () and the &quot;double psi beta barrel&quot; (often simply &quot;double-barrel&quot;) fold. The former is seen in almost all DNA polymerases and almost all viral single-subunit polymerases; they are marked by a conserved &quot;palm&quot; domain. The latter is seen in all multi-subunit RNA polymerases, in cRdRP, and in &quot;family D&quot; DNA polymerases found in archaea. The &quot;X&quot; family represented by DNA polymerase beta has only a vague &quot;palm&quot; shape, and is sometimes considered a different superfamily ().

Primases generally don&#x27;t fall into either category. Bacterial primases usually have the Toprim domain, and are related to topoisomerases and mitochondrial helicase twinkle. Archae and eukaryotic primases form an unrelated AEP family, possibly related to the polymerase palm. Both families nevertheless associate to the same set of helicases.

<text>The Pacific Scandal was a political scandal in Canada involving large sums of money paid by private interests to the Conservative party to cover election expenses in the 1872 Canadian federal election in order to influence the bidding for a national rail contract. As part of British Columbia&#x27;s 1871 agreement to join the Canadian Confederation, the federal government had agreed to build a transcontinental railway linking the seaboard of British Columbia to the eastern provinces.

The scandal led to the resignation of Canada&#x27;s first prime minister, John A. Macdonald, and a transfer of power from his Conservative government to a Liberal government, led by Alexander Mackenzie. One of the new government&#x27;s first measures was to introduce secret ballots in an effort to improve the integrity of future elections. After the scandal broke, the railway plan collapsed, and the proposed line was not built. An entirely different operation later built the Canadian Pacific Railway to the Pacific.

== Background ==
For a young and loosely defined nation, the building of a national railway was an active attempt at state-making, as well as an aggressive capitalist venture. Canada, a nascent country with a population of 3.5 million in 1871, lacked the means to exercise meaningful &quot;de facto&quot; control within the &quot;de jure&quot; political boundaries of the recently acquired Rupert&#x27;s Land, and building a transcontinental railway was a national policy of high order to change that situation. Moreover, after the American Civil War, land-hungry settlers rapidly pushed the American frontier westward, exacerbating talk of annexation. Sentiments of Manifest Destiny were abuzz at the time: in 1867, the year of Canada&#x27;s Confederation, US Secretary of State William H. Seward surmised that the whole North American continent &quot;shall be, sooner or later, within the magic circle of the American Union.&quot; Consequently, preventing American investment in the project was considered to be in Canada&#x27;s national interest. Thus the federal government favoured an &quot;all Canadian route&quot; through the rugged Canadian Shield of northern Ontario and refused to consider a less-costly route passing south through Wisconsin and Minnesota.

However, a route across the Canadian Shield was highly unpopular with potential investors in not only the United States but also Canada and especially Great Britain, the only other viable sources of financing. For would-be investors, the objections were primarily based not on politics or nationalism but on economics. At the time, national governments lacked the finances needed to undertake such large projects. For the first transcontinental railroad, the United States government had made extensive grants of public land to the railway&#x27;s builders, inducing private financiers to fund the railway on the understanding that they would acquire rich farmland along the route, which could then be sold for a large profit. However, the eastern terminus of the proposed Canadian Pacific route, unlike that of the first transcontinental, was not in rich Nebraskan farmland but deep within the Canadian Shield. Copying the American financing model while insisting on an all-Canadian route would require the railway&#x27;s backers to build hundreds of miles of track across rugged shield terrain, with little economic value, at considerable expense before they could access lucrative farmland in Manitoba and the newly created Northwest Territories, which at that time included Alberta and Saskatchewan. Many financiers, who had expected to make a relatively quick profit, were not willing to make such a long-term commitment.

Nevertheless, the Montreal capitalist Hugh Allan, with his syndicate Canada Pacific Railway Company, sought the potentially lucrative charter for the project. The problem lay in that Allan and Macdonald were secretly in cahoots with American financiers such as George W. McMullen and Jay Cooke, who were deeply interested in the rival American undertaking, the Northern Pacific Railroad.

== Scandal ==
Two groups competed for the contract to build the railway, Hugh Allan&#x27;s Canada Pacific Railway Company and David Lewis Macpherson&#x27;s Inter-Oceanic Railway Company. On April 2, 1873, Lucius Seth Huntington, a Liberal Member of Parliament, created an uproar in the House of Commons. He announced he had uncovered evidence that Allan and his associates had been granted the Canadian Pacific Railway contract in return for political donations of $360,000.

In 1873, it became known that Allan had contributed a large sum of money to the Conservative government&#x27;s re-election campaign of 1872; some sources quote a sum over $360,000. Allan had promised to keep American capital out of the railway deal but had lied to Macdonald over this vital point, as Macdonald later discovered. The Liberal Party, the opposition party in Parliament, accused the Conservatives of having made a tacit agreement to give the contract to Hugh Allan in exchange for money.

In making such allegations, the Liberals and their allies in the press (particularly George Brown&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Globe&quot;) presumed that most of the money had been used to bribe voters in the 1872 election. The secret ballot, which was then considered a novelty, had not yet been introduced in Canada. Although it was illegal to offer, solicit, or accept bribes in exchange for votes, effective enforcement of the prohibition proved impossible.

Despite Macdonald&#x27;s claims of innocence, evidence came to light showing transfers of money from Allan to Macdonald and some of his political colleagues. Perhaps even more damaging to Macdonald was the Liberals&#x27; discovery of a telegram through a former employee of Allan, which was thought to have been stolen from the safe of Allan&#x27;s lawyer, John Abbott.

The scandal proved fatal to Macdonald&#x27;s government. Macdonald&#x27;s control of Parliament had already been tenuous since the 1872 election. Since party discipline was not as strong as it is today, once Macdonald&#x27;s culpability in the scandal became known, he could no longer expect to retain the confidence of the House of Commons.

Macdonald resigned as prime minister on November 5, 1873. He also offered his resignation as the head of the Conservative Party, but it was not accepted, and he was convinced to stay. Perhaps as a direct result of this scandal, the Conservatives fell in the eyes of the public and were relegated to the Official Opposition status in the federal election of 1874, in which secret ballots were used for the first time. The election gave Alexander Mackenzie a firm mandate to succeed Macdonald as Canada&#x27;s new prime minister.

Despite the short-term defeat, the scandal was not a mortal wound to Macdonald, the Conservative Party, or the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Long Depression gripped Canada shortly after Macdonald left office, and although the causes of the depression were largely external to Canada, many Canadians blamed Mackenzie for the ensuing hard times. Macdonald returned as prime minister in the 1878 election thanks to his National Policy. He held the office until his death in 1891, and the Canadian Pacific was completed in 1885 while he was still in office, although by a completely different corporation.

<text>A primer is a short, single-stranded nucleic acid used by all living organisms in the initiation of DNA synthesis. A synthetic primer may also be referred to as an oligo, short for oligonucleotide. DNA polymerase (responsible for DNA replication) enzymes are only capable of adding nucleotides to the 3’-end of an existing nucleic acid, requiring a primer be bound to the template before DNA polymerase can begin a complementary strand. DNA polymerase adds nucleotides after binding to the RNA primer and synthesizes the whole strand. Later, the RNA strands must be removed accurately and replace them with DNA nucleotides forming a gap region known as a nick that is filled in using an enzyme called ligase. The removal process of the RNA primer requires several enzymes, such as Fen1, Lig1, and others that work in coordination with DNA polymerase, to ensure the removal of the RNA nucleotides and the addition of DNA nucleotides. Living organisms use solely RNA primers, while laboratory techniques in biochemistry and molecular biology that require in vitro DNA synthesis (such as DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction) usually use DNA primers, since they are more temperature stable. Primers can be designed in laboratory for specific reactions such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). When designing PCR primers, there are specific measures that must be taken into consideration, like the melting temperature of the primers and the annealing temperature of the reaction itself. Moreover, the DNA binding sequence of the primer in vitro has to be specifically chosen, which is done using a method called basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) that scans the DNA and finds specific and unique regions for the primer to bind.

== RNA primers &quot;in vivo&quot; ==
RNA primers are used by living organisms in the initiation of synthesizing a strand of DNA. A class of enzymes called primases add a complementary RNA primer to the reading template &quot;de novo&quot; on both the leading and lagging strands. Starting from the free 3’-OH of the primer, known as the primer terminus, a DNA polymerase can extend a newly synthesized strand. The leading strand in DNA replication is synthesized in one continuous piece moving with the replication fork, requiring only an initial RNA primer to begin synthesis. In the lagging strand, the template DNA runs in the 5′→3′ direction. Since DNA polymerase cannot add bases in the 3′→5′ direction complementary to the template strand, DNA is synthesized ‘backward’ in short fragments moving away from the replication fork, known as Okazaki fragments. Unlike in the leading strand, this method results in the repeated starting and stopping of DNA synthesis, requiring multiple RNA primers. Along the DNA template, primase intersperses RNA primers that DNA polymerase uses to synthesize DNA from in the 5′→3′ direction.

Another example of primers being used to enable DNA synthesis is reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that uses a template strand of RNA to synthesize a complementary strand of DNA. The DNA polymerase component of reverse transcriptase requires an existing 3&#x27; end to begin synthesis.

===Primer removal===
After the insertion of Okazaki fragments, the RNA primers are removed (the mechanism of removal differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes) and replaced with new deoxyribonucleotides that fill the gaps where the RNA primer was present. DNA ligase then joins the fragmented strands together, completing the synthesis of the lagging strand.

In prokaryotes, DNA polymerase I synthesizes the Okazaki fragment until it reaches the previous RNA primer. Then the enzyme simultaneously acts as a 5′→3′ exonuclease, removing primer ribonucleotides in front and adding deoxyribonucleotides behind. Both the activities of polymerization and excision of the RNA primer occur in the 5′→3′ direction,  and polymerase I can do these activities simultaneously; this is known as “Nick Translation”. Nick translation refers to the synchronized activity of polymerase I in removing the RNA primer and adding deoxyribonucleotides. Later, a gap between the strands is formed called a nick, which is sealed using a DNA ligase.

In eukaryotes the removal of RNA primers in the lagging strand is essential for the completion of replication. Thus, as the lagging strand being synthesized by DNA polymerase δ in 5′→3′ direction, Okazaki fragments are formed, which are discontinuous strands of DNA. Then, when the DNA polymerase reaches to the 5’ end of the RNA primer from the previous Okazaki fragment, it displaces the 5′ end of the primer into a single-stranded RNA flap which is removed by nuclease cleavage. Cleavage of the RNA flaps involves three methods of primer removal. The first possibility of primer removal is by creating a short flap that is directly removed by flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 (FEN-1), which cleaves the 5’ overhanging flap. This method is known as the short flap pathway of RNA primer removal. The second way to cleave a RNA primer is by degrading the RNA strand using a RNase, in eukaryotes it’s known as the RNase H2. This enzyme degrades most of the annealed RNA primer, except the nucleotides close to the 5’ end of the primer. Thus, the remaining nucleotides are displayed into a flap that is cleaved off using FEN-1. The last possible method of removing RNA primer is known as the long flap pathway. In this pathway several enzymes are recruited to elongate the RNA primer and then cleave it off. The flaps are elongated by a 5’ to 3’ helicase, known as Pif1. After the addition of nucleotides to the flap by Pif1, the long flap is stabilized by the replication protein A (RPA). The RPA-bound DNA inhibits the activity or recruitment of FEN1, as a result another nuclease must be recruited to cleave the flap. This second nuclease is DNA2 nuclease, which has a helicase-nuclease activity, that cleaves the long flap of RNA primer, which then leaves behind a couple of nucleotides that are cleaved by FEN1. At the end, when all the RNA primers have been removed, nicks form between the Okazaki fragments that are filled-in with deoxyribonucleotides using an enzyme known as ligase1, through a process called ligation.

==Uses of synthetic primers==

Synthetic primers, sometimes known as oligos, are chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, usually of DNA, which can be customized to anneal to a specific site on the template DNA. In solution, the primer spontaneously hybridizes with the template through Watson-Crick base pairing before being extended by DNA polymerase. The ability to create and customize synthetic primers has proven an invaluable tool necessary to a variety of molecular biological approaches involving the analysis of DNA. Both the Sanger chain termination method and the “Next-Gen” method of DNA sequencing require primers to initiate the reaction.

===PCR primer design===
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) uses a pair of custom primers to direct DNA elongation toward each other at opposite ends of the sequence being amplified. These primers are typically between 18 and 24 bases in length and must code for only the specific upstream and downstream sites of the sequence being amplified. A primer that can bind to multiple regions along the DNA will amplify them all, eliminating the purpose of PCR.

A few criteria must be brought into consideration when designing a pair of PCR primers. Pairs of primers should have similar melting temperatures since annealing during PCR occurs for both strands simultaneously, and this shared melting temperature must not be either too much higher or lower than the reaction&#x27;s annealing temperature. A primer with a &quot;T&quot;m (melting temperature) too much higher than the reaction&#x27;s annealing temperature may mishybridize and extend at an incorrect location along the DNA sequence. A &quot;T&quot;m significantly lower than the annealing temperature may fail to anneal and extend at all.

Additionally, primer sequences need to be chosen to uniquely select for a region of DNA, avoiding the possibility of hybridization to a similar sequence nearby. A commonly used method for selecting a primer site is BLAST search, whereby all the possible regions to which a primer may bind can be seen. Both the nucleotide sequence as well as the primer itself can be BLAST searched. The free NCBI tool Primer-BLAST integrates primer design and BLAST search into one application, as do commercial software products such as ePrime and Beacon Designer. Computer simulations of theoretical PCR results (Electronic PCR) may be performed to assist in primer design by giving melting and annealing temperatures, etc.

As of 2014, many online tools are freely available for primer design, some of which focus on specific applications of PCR. Primers with high specificity for a subset of DNA templates in the presence of many similar variants can be designed using by some software (e.g. DECIPHER) or be developed independently for a specific group of animals.

Selecting a specific region of DNA for primer binding requires some additional considerations. Regions high in mononucleotide and dinucleotide repeats should be avoided, as loop formation can occur and contribute to mishybridization. Primers should not easily anneal with other primers in the mixture; this phenomenon can lead to the production of &#x27;primer dimer&#x27; products contaminating the end solution. Primers should also not anneal strongly to themselves, as internal hairpins and loops could hinder the annealing with the template DNA.

When designing primers, additional nucleotide bases can be added to the back ends of each primer, resulting in a customized cap sequence on each end of the amplified region. One application for this practice is for use in TA cloning, a special subcloning technique similar to PCR, where efficiency can be increased by adding AG tails to the 5′ and the 3′ ends.

===Degenerate primers===

Some situations may call for the use of &quot;degenerate primers.&quot; These are mixtures of primers that are similar, but not identical. These may be convenient when amplifying the same gene from different organisms, as the sequences are probably similar but not identical. This technique is useful because the genetic code itself is degenerate, meaning several different codons can code for the same amino acid. This allows different organisms to have a significantly different genetic sequence that code for a highly similar protein. For this reason, degenerate primers are also used when primer design is based on protein sequence, as the specific sequence of codons are not known. Therefore, primer sequence corresponding to the amino acid isoleucine might be &quot;ATH&quot;, where A stands for adenine, T for thymine, and H for adenine, thymine, or cytosine, according to the genetic code for each codon, using the IUPAC symbols for degenerate bases. Degenerate primers may not perfectly hybridize with a target sequence, which can greatly reduce the specificity of the PCR amplification.

&quot;Degenerate primers&quot; are widely used and extremely useful in the field of microbial ecology. They allow for the amplification of genes from thus far uncultivated microorganisms or allow the recovery of genes from organisms where genomic information is not available. Usually, degenerate primers are designed by aligning gene sequencing found in GenBank. Differences among sequences are accounted for by using IUPAC degeneracies for individual bases. PCR primers are then synthesized as a mixture of primers corresponding to all permutations of the codon sequence.

<text>Purine is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound that consists of two rings (pyrimidine and imidazole) fused together. It is water-soluble. Purine also gives its name to the wider class of molecules, purines, which include substituted purines and their tautomers. They are the most widely occurring nitrogen-containing heterocycles in nature.

== Dietary sources ==
Purines are found in high concentration in meat and meat products, especially internal organs such as liver and kidney. In general, plant-based diets are low in purines. High-purine plants and algae include some legumes (lentils, soybeans, and black-eyed peas) and spirulina. Examples of high-purine sources include: sweetbreads, anchovies, sardines, liver, beef kidneys, brains, meat extracts (e.g., Oxo, Bovril), herring, mackerel, scallops, game meats, yeast (beer, yeast extract, nutritional yeast) and some gravy.

A moderate amount of purine is also contained in beef, pork, poultry, fish and seafood, asparagus, cauliflower, spinach, mushrooms, green peas, lentils, dried peas, beans, oatmeal, wheat bran, wheat germ, and haws.

== Biochemistry ==
Purines and pyrimidines make up the two groups of nitrogenous bases, including the two groups of nucleotide bases. The purine bases are guanine (G) and adenine (A) which form corresponding nucleosides-deoxyribonucleosides (deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine) with deoxyribose moiety and ribonucleosides (guanosine, adenosine) with ribose moiety. These nucleosides with phosphoric acid form corresponding nucleotides (deoxyguanylate, deoxyadenylate and guanylate, adenylate) which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, respectively. Purine bases also play an essential role in many metabolic and signalling processes within the compounds guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP).

In order to perform these essential cellular processes, both purines and pyrimidines are needed by the cell, and in similar quantities. Both purine and pyrimidine are self-inhibiting and activating. When purines are formed, they inhibit the enzymes required for more purine formation. This self-inhibition occurs as they also activate the enzymes needed for pyrimidine formation. Pyrimidine simultaneously self-inhibits and activates purine in a similar manner. Because of this, there is nearly an equal amount of both substances in the cell at all times.

==Properties==
Purine is both a very weak acid (pKa 8.93) and an even weaker base (pKa 2.39). If dissolved in pure water, the pH is halfway between these two pKa values.

Purine is aromatic, having four tautomers each with a hydrogen bonded to a different one of the four nitrogen atoms. These are identified as 1-H, 3-H, 7-H, and 9-H (see image of numbered ring). The common crystalline form favours the 7-H tautomer, while in polar solvents both the 9-H and 7-H tautomers predominate. Substituents to the rings and interactions with other molecules can shift the equilibrium of these tautomers.

==Notable purines==
There are many naturally occurring purines. They include the nucleotide bases adenine and guanine. In DNA, these bases form hydrogen bonds with their complementary pyrimidines, thymine and cytosine, respectively. This is called complementary base pairing. In RNA, the complement of adenine is uracil instead of thymine.

Other notable purines are hypoxanthine, xanthine, theophylline, theobromine, caffeine, uric acid and isoguanine.

==Functions==
Aside from the crucial roles of purines (adenine and guanine) in DNA and RNA, purines are also significant components in a number of other important biomolecules, such as ATP, GTP, cyclic AMP, NADH, and coenzyme A. Purine (1) itself, has not been found in nature, but it can be produced by organic synthesis.

They may also function directly as neurotransmitters, acting upon purinergic receptors. Adenosine activates adenosine receptors.

== History ==
The word &quot;purine&quot; (&quot;pure urine&quot;) was coined by the German chemist Emil Fischer in 1884. He synthesized it for the first time in 1898. The starting material for the reaction sequence was uric acid (8), which had been isolated from kidney stones by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1776. Uric acid was reacted with PCl5 to give 2,6,8-trichloropurine, which was converted with HI and PH4I to give 2,6-diiodopurine. The product was reduced to purine using zinc dust.

== Metabolism ==

Many organisms have metabolic pathways to synthesize and break down purines.

Purines are biologically synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose).

Accumulation of modified purine nucleotides is defective to various cellular processes, especially those involving DNA and RNA. To be viable, organisms possess a number of deoxypurine phosphohydrolases, which hydrolyze these purine derivatives removing them from the active NTP and dNTP pools. Deamination of purine bases can result in accumulation of such nucleotides as ITP, dITP, XTP and dXTP.

Defects in enzymes that control purine production and breakdown can severely alter a cell&#x27;s DNA sequences, which may explain why people who carry certain genetic variants of purine metabolic enzymes have a higher risk for some types of cancer.

===Purine biosynthesis in the three domains of life===
Organisms in all three domains of life, eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea, are able to carry out de novo biosynthesis of purines. This ability reflects the essentiality of purines for life. The biochemical pathway of synthesis is very similar in eukaryotes and bacterial species, but is more variable among archaeal species. A nearly complete, or complete, set of genes required for purine biosynthesis was determined to be present in 58 of the 65 archaeal species studied. However, also identified were seven archaeal species with entirely, or nearly entirely, absent purine encoding genes. Apparently the archaeal species unable to synthesize purines are able to acquire exogenous purines for growth., and are thus analogous to purine mutants of eukaryotes, e.g. purine mutants of the Ascomycete fungus &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;, that also require exogenous purines for growth.

=== Relationship with gout ===

Higher levels of meat and seafood consumption are associated with an increased risk of gout, whereas a higher level of consumption of dairy products is associated with a decreased risk. Moderate intake of purine-rich vegetables or protein is not associated with an increased risk of gout. Similar results have been found with the risk of hyperuricemia.

==Laboratory synthesis==
In addition to &quot;in vivo&quot; synthesis of purines in purine metabolism, purine can also be synthesized artificially.

Purine is obtained in good yield when formamide is heated in an open vessel at 170 °C for 28 hours.

This remarkable reaction and others like it have been discussed in the context of the origin of life.

Patented August 20, 1968, the current recognized method of industrial-scale production of adenine is a modified form of the formamide method. This method heats up formamide under 120 °C conditions within a sealed flask for 5 hours to form adenine. The reaction is heavily increased  in quantity by using a phosphorus oxychloride (phosphoryl chloride) or phosphorus pentachloride as an acid catalyst and sunlight or ultraviolet conditions. After the 5 hours have passed and the formamide-phosphorus oxychloride-adenine solution cools down, water is put into the flask containing the formamide and now-formed adenine. The water-formamide-adenine solution is then poured through a filtering column of activated charcoal. The water and formamide molecules, being small molecules, will pass through the charcoal and into the waste flask; the large adenine molecules, however, will attach or “adsorb” to the charcoal due to the van der waals forces that interact between the adenine and the carbon in the charcoal. Because charcoal has a large surface area, it&#x27;s able to capture the majority of molecules that pass a certain size (greater than water and formamide) through it. To extract the adenine from the charcoal-adsorbed adenine, ammonia gas dissolved in water (aqua ammonia) is poured onto the activated charcoal-adenine structure to liberate the adenine into the ammonia-water solution. The solution containing water, ammonia, and adenine is then left to air dry, with the adenine losing solubility due to the loss of ammonia gas that previously made the solution basic and capable of dissolving adenine, thus causing it to crystallize into a pure white powder that can be stored.

Oro and Kamat (1961) and Orgel co-workers (1966, 1967) have shown that four molecules of HCN tetramerize to form diaminomaleodinitrile (12), which can be converted into almost all naturally occurring purines. For example, five molecules of HCN condense in an exothermic reaction to make adenine, especially in the presence of ammonia.


The Traube purine synthesis (1900) is a classic reaction (named after Wilhelm Traube) between an amine-substituted pyrimidine and formic acid.

==Prebiotic synthesis of purine ribonucleosides==

In order to understand how life arose, knowledge is required of the chemical pathways that permit formation of the key building blocks of life under plausible prebiotic conditions. Nam et al. (2018) demonstrated the direct condensation of purine and pyrimidine nucleobases with ribose to give ribonucleosides in aqueous microdroplets, a key step leading to RNA formation. Also, a plausible prebiotic process for synthesizing purine ribonucleosides was presented by Becker &quot;et al&quot;. in 2016.

<text>Pyrimidine (; ) is an aromatic, heterocyclic, organic compound similar to pyridine (). One of the three diazines (six-membered heterocyclics with two nitrogen atoms in the ring), it has nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3 in the ring. The other diazines are pyrazine (nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 4 positions) and pyridazine (nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 2 positions). 

In nucleic acids, three types of nucleobases are pyrimidine derivatives: cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U).

==Occurrence and history==

The pyrimidine ring system has wide occurrence in nature
as substituted and ring fused compounds and derivatives, including the nucleotides cytosine, thymine and uracil, thiamine (vitamin B1) and alloxan. It is also found in many synthetic compounds such as barbiturates and the HIV drug zidovudine. Although pyrimidine derivatives such as alloxan were known in the early 19th century, a laboratory synthesis of a pyrimidine was not carried out until 1879, when Grimaux reported the preparation of barbituric acid from urea and malonic acid in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride.
The systematic study of pyrimidines began in 1884 with Pinner,
who synthesized derivatives by condensing ethyl acetoacetate with amidines. Pinner first proposed the name “pyrimidin” in 1885. The parent compound was first prepared by Gabriel and Colman in 1900,

by conversion of barbituric acid to 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine followed by reduction using zinc dust in hot water.

==Nomenclature==
The nomenclature of pyrimidines is straightforward. However, like other heterocyclics, tautomeric hydroxyl groups yield complications since they exist primarily in the cyclic amide form. For example, 2-hydroxypyrimidine is more properly named 2-pyrimidone. A partial list of trivial names of various pyrimidines exists.

==Physical properties==
Physical properties are shown in the data box. A more extensive discussion, including spectra, can be found in Brown &quot;et al.&quot;

== Chemical properties ==
Per the classification by Albert, six-membered heterocycles can be described as π-deficient. Substitution by electronegative groups or additional nitrogen atoms in the ring significantly increase the π-deficiency. These effects also decrease the basicity.

Like pyridines, in pyrimidines the π-electron density is decreased to an even greater extent. Therefore, electrophilic aromatic substitution is more difficult while nucleophilic aromatic substitution is facilitated. An example of the last reaction type is the displacement of the amino group in 2-aminopyrimidine by chlorine and its reverse.

Electron lone pair availability (basicity) is decreased compared to pyridine. Compared to pyridine, &quot;N&quot;-alkylation and &quot;N&quot;-oxidation are more difficult. The p&quot;K&quot;a value for protonated pyrimidine is 1.23 compared to 5.30 for pyridine. Protonation and other electrophilic additions will occur at only one nitrogen due to further deactivation by the second nitrogen. The 2-, 4-, and 6- positions on the pyrimidine ring are electron deficient analogous to those in pyridine and nitro- and dinitrobenzene. The 5-position is less electron deficient and substituents there are quite stable. However, electrophilic substitution is relatively facile at the 5-position, including nitration and halogenation.

Reduction in resonance stabilization of pyrimidines may lead to addition and ring cleavage reactions rather than substitutions. One such manifestation is observed in the Dimroth rearrangement.

Pyrimidine is also found in meteorites, but scientists still do not know its origin. Pyrimidine also photolytically decomposes into uracil under ultraviolet light.

== Synthesis ==
Pyrimidine biosynthesis creates derivatives —like orotate, thymine, cytosine, and uracil— &quot;de novo&quot; from carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate.

As is often the case with parent heterocyclic ring systems, the synthesis of pyrimidine is not that common and is usually performed by removing functional groups from derivatives. Primary syntheses in quantity involving formamide have been reported.

As a class, pyrimidines are typically synthesized by the principal synthesis involving cyclization of β-dicarbonyl compounds with N–C–N compounds. Reaction of the former with amidines to give 2-substituted pyrimidines, with urea to give 2-pyrimidinones, and guanidines to give 2-aminopyrimidines are typical.

Pyrimidines can be prepared via the Biginelli reaction and other multicomponent reactions. Many other methods rely on condensation of carbonyls with diamines for instance the synthesis of 2-thio-6-methyluracil from thiourea and ethyl acetoacetate or the synthesis of 4-methylpyrimidine with 4,4-dimethoxy-2-butanone and formamide.

A novel method is by reaction of &quot;N&quot;-vinyl and &quot;N&quot;-aryl amides with carbonitriles under electrophilic activation of the amide with 2-chloro-pyridine and trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride:

==Reactions==
Because of the decreased basicity compared to pyridine, electrophilic substitution of pyrimidine is less facile. Protonation or alkylation typically takes place at only one of the ring nitrogen atoms. Mono-&quot;N&quot;-oxidation occurs by reaction with peracids.

Electrophilic &quot;C&quot;-substitution of pyrimidine occurs at the 5-position, the least electron-deficient. Nitration, nitrosation, azo coupling, halogenation, sulfonation, formylation, hydroxymethylation, and aminomethylation have been observed with substituted pyrimidines.

Nucleophilic &quot;C&quot;-substitution should be facilitated at the 2-, 4-, and 6-positions but there are only a few examples. Amination and hydroxylation have been observed for substituted pyrimidines. Reactions with Grignard or alkyllithium reagents yield 4-alkyl- or 4-aryl pyrimidine after aromatization.

Free radical attack has been observed for pyrimidine and photochemical reactions have been observed for substituted pyrimidines. Pyrimidine can be hydrogenated to give tetrahydropyrimidine.

== Derivatives ==
=== Nucleotides ===

Three nucleobases found in nucleic acids, cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U), are pyrimidine derivatives:

In DNA and RNA, these bases form hydrogen bonds with their complementary purines. Thus, in DNA, the purines adenine (A) and guanine (G) pair up with the pyrimidines thymine (T) and cytosine (C), respectively.

In RNA, the complement of adenine (A) is uracil (U) instead of thymine (T), so the pairs that form are adenine:uracil and guanine:cytosine.

Very rarely, thymine can appear in RNA, or uracil in DNA, but when the other three major pyrimidine bases are represented, some minor pyrimidine bases can also occur in nucleic acids. These minor pyrimidines are usually methylated versions of major ones and are postulated to have regulatory functions.

These hydrogen bonding modes are for classical Watson–Crick base pairing. Other hydrogen bonding modes (&quot;wobble pairings&quot;) are available in both DNA and RNA, although the additional 2′-hydroxyl group of RNA expands the configurations, through which RNA can form hydrogen bonds.

==Theoretical aspects==
In March 2015, NASA Ames scientists reported that, for the first time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds.

===Prebiotic synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides===
In order to understand how life arose, knowledge is required of the chemical pathways that permit formation of the key building blocks of life under plausible prebiotic conditions. The RNA world hypothesis holds that in the primordial soup there existed free-floating ribonucleotides, the fundamental molecules that combine in series to form RNA. Complex molecules such as RNA must have emerged from relatively small molecules whose reactivity was governed by physico-chemical processes. RNA is composed of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides, both of which are necessary for reliable information transfer, and thus natural selection and Darwinian evolution. Becker et al. showed how pyrimidine nucleosides can be synthesized from small molecules and ribose, driven solely by wet-dry cycles. Purine nucleosides can be synthesized by a similar pathway. 5’-mono-and diphosphates also form selectively from phosphate-containing minerals, allowing concurrent formation of polyribonucleotides with both the pyrimidine and purine bases. Thus a reaction network towards the pyrimidine and purine RNA building blocks can be established starting from simple atmospheric or volcanic molecules.

<text>A play-by-mail game (also known as a PBM game, PBEM game, turn-based game, turn based distance game, or an interactive strategy game.) is a game played through postal mail, email, or other digital media. Correspondence chess and Go were among the first PBM games. &quot;Diplomacy&quot; has been played by mail since 1963, introducing a multi-player aspect to PBM games. Flying Buffalo Inc. pioneered the first commercially available PBM game in 1970. A small number of PBM companies followed in the 1970s, with an explosion of hundreds of startup PBM companies in the 1980s at the peak of PBM gaming popularity, many of them small hobby companies—more than 90 percent of which eventually folded. A number of independent PBM magazines also started in the 1980s, including &quot;The Nuts &amp; Bolts of PBM&quot;, &quot;Gaming Universal&quot;, &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot; and &quot;Flagship&quot;. These magazines eventually went out of print, replaced in the 21st century by the online PBM journal &quot;Suspense and Decision&quot;.

Play-by-mail games (which became known as &quot;turn-based games&quot; in the digital age) have a number of advantages and disadvantages compared to other kinds of gaming. PBM games have wide ranges for turn lengths. Some games allow turnaround times of a day or less—even hourly. Other games structure multiple days or weeks for players to consider moves or turns and players never run out of opponents to face. If desired, some PBM games can be played for years. Additionally, the complexity of PBM games can be far beyond that allowed by a board game in an afternoon, and pit players against live opponents in these conditions—a challenge some players enjoy. PBM games allow the number of opponents or teams in the dozens—with some previous examples over a thousand players. PBM games also allow gamers to interact with others globally. Games with low turn costs compare well with expensive board or video games. Drawbacks include the price for some PBM games with high setup and/or turn costs, and the lack of the ability for face-to-face roleplaying. Additionally, for some players, certain games can be overly complex, and delays in turn processing can be a negative.

Play-by-mail games are multifaceted. In their earliest form they involved two players mailing each other directly by postal mail, such as in correspondence chess. Multi-player games, such as &quot;Diplomacy&quot; or more complex games available today, involve a game master who receives and processes orders and adjudicates turn results for players. These games also introduced the element of diplomacy in which participants can discuss gameplay with each other, strategize, and form alliances. In the 1970s and 1980s, some games involved turn results adjudicated completely by humans. Over time, partial or complete turn adjudication by computer became the norm. Games also involve open- and closed-end variants. Open-ended games do not normally end and players can develop their positions to the fullest extent possible; in closed-end games, players pursue victory conditions until a game conclusion. PBM games enable players to explore a diverse array of roles, such as characters in fantasy or medieval settings, space opera, inner city gangs, or more unusual ones such as assuming the role of a microorganism or a monster.

==History==

The earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using postal mail. Chess and Go are among the oldest examples of this. In these two-player games, players sent moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later: &quot;Diplomacy&quot; is an early example of this type, emerging in 1963, in which a central game master manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. According to Shannon Appelcline, there was some PBM play in the 1960s, but not much. For example, some wargamers began playing &quot;Stalingrad&quot; by mail in this period.

In the early 1970s, in the United States, Rick Loomis, of Flying Buffalo Inc., began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games; these included games such as &quot;Nuclear Destruction&quot;, which launched in 1970. This began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as &quot;Battleplan&quot;, &quot;Heroic Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Starweb&quot;, and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.

For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until Schubel &amp; Son entered the field in roughly 1976 with the human-moderated &quot;Tribes of Crane&quot;. Schubel &amp; Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. For players with larger bankrolls, this provided advantages and the ability to game the system. The next big entrant was Superior Simulations with its game &quot;Empyrean Challenge&quot; in 1978. Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was &quot;the most complex game system on Earth&quot; with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.

Chris Harvey started the commercial PBM industry in the United Kingdom with a company called ICBM. After Harvey played Flying Buffalo&#x27;s &quot;Nuclear Destruction&quot; game in the United States in approximately 1971, Rick Loomis suggested that he run the game in the UK with Flying Buffalo providing the computer moderation. ICBM Games led the industry in the UK as a result of this proxy method of publishing Flying Buffalo&#x27;s PBM games, along with KJC games and Mitregames.

In the early 1980s, the field of PBM players was growing. Individual PBM game moderators were plentiful in 1980. However, the PBM industry in 1980 was still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones. The most popular PBM games of 1980 were &quot;Starweb&quot; and &quot;Tribes of Crane&quot;.

Some players, unhappy with their experiences with Schubel &amp; Son and Superior Simulations, launched their own company—Adventures by Mail—with the game, &quot;&quot;Beyond the Stellar Empire&quot;&quot;, which became &quot;immensely popular&quot;. In the same way, many people launched PBM companies, trying their hand at finding the right mix of action and strategy for the gaming audience of the period. According to Jim Townsend: In the late 70&#x27;s and all of the 80&#x27;s, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.

Townsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that &quot;The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.&quot; W.G. Armintrout wrote a 1982 article in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; magazine warning those thinking of entering the professional PBM field of the importance of playtesting games to mitigate the risk of failure. By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies, not run as businesses to make money. Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States—with an additional few in the United Kingdom and the same in Australia. Sam Roads of Harlequin Games similarly assessed the state of the PBM industry in its early days while also noting the existence of few non-English companies. 

By the 1980s, interest in PBM gaming in Europe increased. The first UK PBM convention was in 1986. In 1993, the founder of &quot;Flagship&quot; magazine, Nick Palmer, stated that &quot;recently there has been a rapid diffusion throughout continental Europe where now there are now thousands of players&quot;. In 1992, Jon Tindall stated that the number of Australian players was growing, but limited by a relatively small market base. In a 2002 listing of 182 primarily European PBM game publishers and Zines, &quot;Flagship&quot; listed ten non-UK entries, to include one each from Austria and France, six from Germany, one from Greece, and one from the Netherlands.

PBM games up to the 1980s came from multiple sources: some were adapted from existing games and others were designed solely for postal play. In 1985, Pete Tamlyn stated that most popular games had already been attempted in postal play, noting that none had succeeded as well as &quot;Diplomacy&quot;. Tamlyn added that there was significant experimentation in adapting games to postal play at the time and that most games could be played by mail. These adapted games were typically run by a gamemaster using a fanzine to publish turn results. The 1980s were also noteworthy in that PBM games designed and published in this decade were written specifically for the genre versus adapted from other existing games. Thus they tended to be more complicated and gravitated toward requiring computer assistance.

The proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry. As of 1983, &quot;The Nuts &amp; Bolts of PBM&quot; was the primary magazine in this market. In July 1983, the first issue of &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot; was published. The first issue was a newsletter with a print run of 100. &quot;Flagship&quot; began publication in the United Kingdom in October 1983, the month before &quot;Gaming Universal&#x27;s&quot; first issue was published in the United States. In the mid-1980s, general gaming magazines also began carrying articles on PBM and ran PBM advertisements. PBM games were featured in magazines like &quot;Games&quot; and &quot;Analog&quot; in 1984. In the early 1990s, Martin Popp also began publishing a quarterly PBM magazine in Sulzberg, Germany called &quot;Postspielbote&quot;. The PBM genre&#x27;s two preeminent magazines of the period were &quot;Flagship&quot; and &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot;.

In 1984, the PBM industry created a Play-by-Mail Association. This organization had multiple charter members by early 1985 and was holding elections for key positions. One of its proposed functions was to reimburse players who lost money after a PBM business failed.

Paul Brown, the president of Reality Simulations, Inc., estimated in 1988 that there were about 20,000 steady play-by-mail gamers, with potentially another 10–20,000 who tried PBM gaming but did not stay. Flying Buffalo Inc. conducted a survey of 167 of its players in 1984. It indicated that 96% of its players were male with most in their 20s and 30s. Nearly half were white collar workers, 28% were students, and the remainder engineers and military.

The 1990s brought changes to the PBM world. In the early 1990s, trending PBM games increased in complexity. In this period, email also became an option to transmit turn orders and results. These are called play-by-email (PBEM) games. &quot;Flagship&quot; reported in 1992 that they knew of 40 PBM gamemasters on Compuserve. One publisher in 2002 called PBM games &quot;Interactive Strategy Games&quot;. Turn around time ranges for modern PBM games are wide enough that PBM magazine editors now use the term &quot;turn-based games&quot;. &quot;Flagship&quot; stated in 2005 that &quot;play-by-mail games are often called turn-based games now that most of them are played via the internet&quot;. In the 2023 issues of Suspense &amp; Decision, the publisher used the term &quot;Turn Based Distance Gaming&quot;.

In the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the player momentum from the 1980s. For example, in 1993, &quot;Flagship&quot; listed 185 active play-by-mail games. Patrick M. Rodgers also stated in &quot;Shadis&quot; magazine that the United States had over 300 PBM games. And in 1993, the &quot;Journal of the PBM Gamer&quot; stated that &quot;For the past several years, PBM gaming has increased in popularity.&quot; That year, there were a few hundred PBM games available for play globally. However, in 1994, David Webber, &quot;Paper Mayhem&#x27;s&quot; editor in chief expressed concern about disappointing growth in the PBM community and a reduction in play by established gamers. At the same time, he noted that his analysis indicated that more PBM gamers were playing less, giving the example of an average drop from 5–6 games per player to 2–3 games, suggesting it could be due to financial reasons. In early 1997, David Webber stated that multiple PBM game moderators had noted a drop in players over the previous year.

By the end of the 1990s, the number of PBM publications had also declined. &quot;Gaming Universal&#x27;s&quot; final publication run ended in 1988. &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot; ceased publication unexpectedly in 1998 after Webber&#x27;s death. &quot;Flagship&quot; also later ceased publication.

The Internet affected the PBM world in various ways. Rick Loomis stated in 1999 that, &quot;With the growth of the Internet, [PBM] seems to have shrunk and a lot of companies dropped out of the business in the last 4 or 5 years.&quot; Shannon Appelcline agreed, noting in 2014 that, &quot;The advent of the Internet knocked most PBM publishers out of business.&quot; The Internet also enabled PBM to globalize between the 1990s and 2000s. Early PBM professional gaming typically occurred within single countries. In the 1990s, the largest PBM games were licensed globally, with &quot;each country having its own licensee&quot;. By the 2000s, a few major PBM firms began operating globally, bringing about &quot;The Globalisation of PBM&quot; according to Sam Roads of Harlequin Games.

By 2014 the PBM community had shrunk compared to previous decades. A single PBM magazine exists—&quot;Suspense and Decision&quot;—which began publication in November 2013. The PBM genre has also morphed from its original postal mail format with the onset of the digital age. In 2010, Carol Mulholland—the editor of &quot;Flagship&quot;—stated that &quot;most turn-based games are now available by email and online&quot;. The online Suspense &amp; Decision Games Index, as of June 2021, listed 72 active PBM, PBEM, and turn-based games. In a multiple-article examination of various online turn-based games in 2004 titled &quot;Turning Digital&quot;, Colin Forbes concluded that &quot;the number and diversity of these games has been enough to convince me that turn-based gaming is far from dead&quot;.

==Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming==
Judith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time—potentially days—to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have &quot;new tactics and ideas&quot;, (3) the ability to play an &quot;incredibly complex&quot; game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs. In 2019, Rick McDowell, designer of &quot;Alamaze&quot;, compared PBM costs favorably with the high cost of board games at Barnes &amp; Noble, with many of the latter going for about $70, and a top-rated game, &quot;Nemesis&quot;, costing $189. Andrew Greenberg pointed to the high number of players possible in a PBM game, comparing it to his past failure at attempting once to host a live eleven-player &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Game. &quot;Flagship&quot; noted in 2005 that &quot;It&#x27;s normal to play these ... games with international firms and a global player base. Games have been designed that can involve large numbers of players – much larger than can gather for face-to-face gaming.&quot; Finally, some PBM games can be played for years, if desired.

Greenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the clearest was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive. Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face interaction inherent in play-by-mail games. Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional turn processing delays can be negatives in the genre.

==Description==
PBM games can include Combat, Diplomacy, Politics, Exploration, Economics, and Role-Playing, with combat a usual feature and open-ended games typically the most comprehensive. Jim Townsend identifies the two key figures in PBM games as the players and the moderators, the latter of which are companies that charge &quot;turn fees&quot; to players—the cost for each game turn. In 1993, &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot;—a magazine for play-by-mail gamers—described play-by-mail games thusly: PBM Games vary in the size of the games, turn around time, length of time a game lasts, and prices. An average PBM game has 10–20 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. ... Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn is about $5.00.

The earliest PBM games were played using the postal services of the respective countries. In 1990, the average turn-around time for a turn was 2–3 weeks. However, in the 1990s, email was introduced to PBM games. This was known as play-by-email (PBEM). Some games used email solely, while others, such as &quot;Hyborian War&quot;, used email as options for a portion of turn transmittal, with postal service for the remainder. Other games use digital media or web applications to allow players to make turns at speeds faster than postal mail. Given these changes, the term &quot;turn-based games&quot; is now being used by some commentators.

===Mechanics===

After the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out an order sheet for a game and return it to the gaming company. The company processes the orders and sends back turn results to the players so they can make subsequent moves.

R. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts. First, the company informs players on the results of the last turn. Next players conduct diplomatic activities, if desired. Then, they send their next turns to the gamemaster (GM). Finally, the turns are processed and the cycle is repeated. This continues until the game or a player is done.

===Complexity===
Jim Townsend stated in a 1990 issue of &quot;White Wolf Magazine&quot; that the complexity of PBM games is much higher than other types on the average. He noted that PBM games at the extreme high end can have a thousand or more players as well as thousands of units to manage, while turn printouts can range from a simple one-page result to hundreds of pages (with three to seven as the average). According to John Kevin Loth, &quot;Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.&quot; In 1986, he highlighted the complexity of &quot;Midgard&quot; with its 100-page instruction manual and 255 possible orders. A.D. Young stated in 1982 that computers could assist PBM gamers in various ways including accounting for records, player interactions, and movements, as well as computation or analysis specific to individual games.

Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that &quot;Empyrean Challenge&quot; was &quot;the most complex game system on Earth&quot;. Other games, like &quot;Galactic Prisoners&quot; began simply and gradually increased in complexity. As of August 2021, Rick Loomis PBM Games&#x27; had four difficulty levels: easy, moderate, hard, and difficult, with games such as &quot;Nuclear Destruction&quot; and &quot;Heroic Fantasy&quot; on the easy end and &quot;Battleplan&quot;—a military strategy game—rated as difficult.

===Diplomacy===
According to &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot; assistant editor Jim Townsend, &quot;The most important aspect of PBM games is the diplomacy. If you don&#x27;t communicate with the other players you will be labeled a &#x27;loner&#x27;, &#x27;mute&#x27;, or just plain &#x27;dead meat&#x27;. You must talk with the others to survive&quot;. The editors of &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot; add that &quot;The interaction with other players is what makes PBM enjoyable.&quot;

Commentator Rob Chapman in a 1983 &quot;Flagship&quot; article echoed this advice, recommending that players get to know their opponents. He also recommended asking direct questions of opponents on their future intentions, as their responses, true or false, provide useful information. However, he advises players to be truthful in PBM diplomacy, as a reputation for honesty is useful in the long-term. Chapman notes that &quot;everything is negotiable&quot; and advises players to &quot;Keep your plans flexible, your options open – don&#x27;t commit yourself, or your forces, to any long term strategy&quot;.

Eric Stehle, owner and operator of Empire Games in 1997, stated that some games cannot be won alone and require diplomacy. He suggested considering the following diplomatic points during gameplay: (1) &quot;Know Your Neighbors&quot;, (2) &quot;Make Sure Potential Allies Share Your Goals&quot;, (3) &quot;Be A Good Ally&quot;, (4) &quot;Coordinate Carefully With Your Allies&quot;, (5) &quot;Be A Vicious Enemy&quot;, and (6) &quot;Fight One Enemy At A Time&quot;.

===Game types and player roles===

Jim Townsend noted in 1990 that hundreds of PBM games were available, ranging from &quot;all science fiction and fantasy themes to such exotics as war simulations (generally more complex world war games than those which wargamers play), duelling games, humorous games, sports simulations, etc&quot;. In 1993, Steve Pritchard described PBM game types as ancient wargames, diplomacy games, fantasy wargames, power games, roleplaying games, and sports games. Some PBM games defy easy categorization, such as &quot;Firebreather&quot;, which Joey Browning, the editor of the U.S. &quot;Flagship&quot; described as a &quot;Fantasy Exploration&quot; game.

Play-by-mail games also provide a wide array of possible roles to play. These include &quot;trader, fighter, explorer, [and] diplomat&quot;. Roles range from pirates to space characters to &quot;previously unknown creatures&quot;. In the game &quot;Monster Island&quot;, players assume the role of a monster which explores a massive island (see image). And the title of the PBM game &quot;You&#x27;re An Amoeba, GO!&quot; indicates an unusual role as players struggle &quot;in a 3D pool of primordial ooze [directing] the evolution of a legion of micro-organisms&quot;. Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but prioritizing this aspect requires more time searching for the right PBM game.

===Closed versus open ended===
According to John Kevin Loth III, open-ended games do not end and there is no final objective or way to win the game. Jim Townsend adds that, &quot;players come and go, powers grow and diminish, alliances form and dissolve and so forth&quot;. Since surviving, rather than winning, is primary, this type of game tends to attract players more interested in role-playing, and Townsend echoes that open-ended games are similar to long-term RPG campaigns. A drawback of this type is that mature games have powerful groups that can pose an unmanageable problem for the beginneralthough some may see this situation as a challenge of sorts. Examples of open ended games are &quot;Heroic Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Monster Island&quot;, and &quot;SuperNova: Rise of the Empire&quot;. Townsend noted in 1990 that some open-ended games had been in play for up to a decade.

Townsend states that &quot;closed-ended games are like Risk or Monopolyonce they&#x27;re over, they&#x27;re over&quot;. Loth notes that most players in closed end games start equally and the games are &quot;faster paced, usually more intense... presenting frequent player confrontation; [and] the game terminates when a player or alliance of players has achieved specific conditions or eliminated all opposition&quot;. Townsend stated in 1990 that closed-end games can have as few as ten and as many as eighty turns. Examples of closed-end games are &quot;Hyborian War&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Crime&quot;, and &quot;Starweb&quot;.

Companies in the early 1990s also offered games with both open- and closed-ended versions. Additionally, games could have elements of both versions; for example, in &quot;Kingdom&quot;, an open-ended PBM game published by Graaf Simulations, a player could win by accumulating 50,000 points.

===Computer versus human moderated===
In the 1980s, PBM companies began using computers to moderate games. This was in part for economic reasons, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, one hundred percent computer-moderated games would also kill a player&#x27;s character or empire emotionlessly, regardless of the effort invested. Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward one hundred percent human moderation. Loth provided &quot;Beyond the Quadra Zone&quot; and &quot;Earthwood&quot; as popular computer-moderated examples in 1986 and &quot;Silverdawn&quot; and &quot;Sword Lords&quot; as one hundred percent human-moderated examples of the period. &quot;Borderlands of Khataj&quot; is an example of a game where the company transitioned from human- to computer-moderated to mitigate issues related to a growing player base.

In 1984, there was a shift toward mixed moderation—human moderated games with computer-moderated aspects such as combat. Examples included &quot;Delenda est Carthago&quot;, &quot;Star Empires&quot;, and &quot;Starglobe&quot;. In 1990, the editors of &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot; noted that there were games with a mix of computer and hand moderation, where games &quot;would have the numbers run by the computer and special actions in the game would receive attention from the game master&quot;.

==Cost and turn processing time==
Loth noted that, in 1986, $3–5 per turn was the most prevalent cost. At the time, some games were free, while others cost as much as $100 per turn.

PBM magazine &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot; stated that the average turn processing time in 1987 was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most common. Some companies offered longer turnaround times for overseas players or other reasons. In 1985, the publisher for &quot;Angrelmar: The Court of Kings&quot; scheduled three month turn processing times after a break in operations. 

In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies. By the 1990s, players had more options for online play-by-mail games. For example, in 1995, &quot;World Conquest&quot; was available to play with hourly turns. In the 21st century, many games of this genre are called &quot;turn-based games&quot; and are played via the Internet.

Game turns can be processed simultaneously or serially. In simultaneously processed games, the publisher processes turns from all players together according to an established sequence. In serial-processed games, turns are processed when received within the determined turn processing window.

==Information sources==

Rick Loomis of Flying Buffalo Games stated in 1985 that the &quot;Nuts &amp; Bolts of PBM&quot; (first called &quot;Nuts &amp; Bolts of Starweb&quot;) was the first PBM magazine not published by a PBM company. The name changed to &quot;Nuts &amp; Bolts of Gaming&quot; and it eventually went out of print. In 1983, the U.S. PBM magazines &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot; and &quot;Gaming Universal&quot; began publication as well as &quot;Flagship&quot; in the UK. Also in 1983, PBM games were featured in magazines like &quot;Games&quot; and &quot;Analog&quot; in 1984 as well as Australia&#x27;s gaming magazine &quot;Breakout&quot; in 1992.

By 1985, &quot;Nuts &amp; Bolts of Gaming&quot; and &quot;Gaming Universal&quot; in the U.S. were out of print. John Kevin Loth identified that, in 1986, the &quot;three major information sources in PBM&quot; were &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot;, &quot;Flagship&quot;, and the Play By Mail Association. These sources were solely focused on play-by-mail gaming. Additional PBM information sources included company-specific publications, although Rick Loomis stated that interest was limited to individual companies&quot;. Finally, play-by-mail gamers could also draw from &quot;alliances, associations, and senior players&quot; for information.

In the mid-1980s, other gaming magazines also began venturing into PBM. For example, &quot;White Wolf Magazine&quot; began a regular PBM column beginning in issue #11 as well as publishing an annual PBM issue beginning with issue #16. &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; also carried PBM articles and reviews. Additional minor information sources included gaming magazines such as &quot;&quot;Different Worlds&quot; ... &quot;Game New&quot;, &quot;Imagine&quot;, and &quot;White Dwarf&quot;&quot;. Dragon Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Ares&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Strategy and Tactics&quot; magazines provided PBM coverage along with Flying Buffalo&#x27;s &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. Gaming magazine &quot;Micro Adventurer&quot;, which closed in 1985, also featured PBM games. Other PBM magazines in the late 1980s in the UK included &quot;Thrust&quot;, and &quot;Warped Sense of Humour&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Martin Popp also began publishing a quarterly PBM magazine in Sulzberg, Germany called &quot;Postspielbote&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Post &amp; Play Unlimited&quot; stated that it was the only German-language PBM magazine. In its March 1992 issue, &quot;Flagship&quot; stated that it checked &quot;Simcoarum Bimonthly&quot; for PBM news. &quot;Shadis&quot; magazine stated in 1994 that it had begun carrying a 16-page PBM section. This section, called &quot;Post Marque&quot;, was discontinued after the March/April 1995 issue (#18), after which PBM coverage was integrated into other magazine sections. In its January–February 1995 issue, &quot;Flagship&#x27;s&quot; editor noted that their &quot;main European competitor&quot; &quot;PBM Scroll&quot; had gone out of print.

&quot;Flagship&quot; ran into the 21st century, but ceased publication in 2010. In November 2013, online PBM journal &quot;Suspense &amp; Decision&quot;, began publication.

==Fiction==
Besides articles and reviews on PBM games, authors have also published PBM fiction articles according to Shannon Muir. An early example called &quot;Scapegoat&quot; by Mike Horn appeared in the May–June 1984 issue of &quot;Paper Mayhem&quot; magazine. Examples include &quot;A Loaf of Bread&quot; by Suzanna Y. Snow about the game &quot;A Duel of a Different Color&quot;, &quot;Dark Beginnings&quot; by Dave Bennett about &quot;Darkness of Silverfall&quot;, and Chris Harvey&#x27;s &quot;It Was the Only Thing He Could Do...&quot;, about a conglomeration of PBM games. Simon Williams, the gamemaster of the PBM game &quot;Chaos Trail&quot; in 2004, also wrote an article in &quot;Flagship&quot; about the possibility of writing a PBM fiction novel.

<doc id="23659" wikidata="Q184148" url="?curid=23659" title="Plug-in (computing)">
<text>In computing, a plug-in (or plugin, add-in, addin, add-on, or addon) is a software component that extends the functionality of an existing software system without requiring the system to be re-built. A plug-in feature is one way that a system can be customizable.

Applications support plug-ins for a variety of reasons including:
* Enable third-party developers to extend an application
* Support easily adding new features
* Reduce the size of an application by not loading unused features
* Separate source code from an application because of incompatible software licenses

==Examples==

Examples of plug-in use for various categories of applications:
* Digital audio workstations and audio editing software use audio plug-ins to generate, process or analyze sound. Ardour, Audacity, Cubase, FL Studio, Logic Pro X and Pro Tools are examples of such systems.
* Email clients use plug-ins to decrypt and encrypt email. Pretty Good Privacy is an example of such plug-ins.
* Video game console emulators often use plug-ins to modularize the separate subsystems of the devices they seek to emulate. For example, the PCSX2 emulator makes use of video, audio, optical, etc. plug-ins for those respective components of the PlayStation 2.
* Graphics software use plug-ins to support file formats and process images. A Photoshop plug-in may do this.
* Broadcasting and live-streaming software, like OBS Studio, as an open source software utilises plug-ins for user-specific needs.
* Media players use plug-ins to support file formats and apply filters. foobar2000, GStreamer, Quintessential, VST, Winamp, XMMS are examples of such media players.
* Packet sniffers use plug-ins to decode packet formats. OmniPeek is an example of such packet sniffers.
* Remote sensing applications use plug-ins to process data from different sensor types; e.g., Opticks.
* Text editors and Integrated development environments use plug-ins to support programming languages or enhance the development process &quot;e.g.&quot;, Visual Studio, RAD Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, jEdit and MonoDevelop support plug-ins. Visual Studio itself can be plugged into other applications via Visual Studio Tools for Office and Visual Studio Tools for Applications.
* Web browsers have historically used executables as plug-ins, though they are now mostly deprecated. Examples include the Adobe Flash Player, a Java virtual machine (for Java applets), QuickTime, Microsoft Silverlight and the Unity Web Player. (Browser extensions, which are a separate type of installable module, are still widely in use.)
==Mechanism==
The host application provides services which the plug-in can use, including a way for plug-ins to register themselves with the host application and a protocol for the exchange of data with plug-ins. Plug-ins depend on the services provided by the host application and do not usually work by themselves. Conversely, the host application operates independently of the plug-ins, making it possible for end-users to add and update plug-ins dynamically without needing to make changes to the host application.

Programmers typically implement plug-ins as shared libraries, which get dynamically loaded at run time. HyperCard supported a similar facility, but more commonly included the plug-in code in the HyperCard documents (called &quot;stacks&quot;) themselves. Thus the HyperCard stack became a self-contained application in its own right, distributable as a single entity that end-users could run without the need for additional installation-steps. Programs may also implement plug-ins by loading a directory of simple script files written in a scripting language like Python or Lua.

==Helper application==

In the context of a web browser, a helper application is a separate programlike IrfanView or Adobe Readerthat extends the functionality of a browser. A helper application extends the functionality an application but unlike the typical plug-in that is loaded into the host application&#x27;s address space, a helper application is a separate application. With a separate address space, the extension cannot crash the host application as is possible if they share an address space.

==History==
In the mid-1970s, the EDT text editor ran on the Unisys VS/9 operating system for the UNIVAC Series 90 mainframe computer. It allowed a program to be run from the editor which can access the in-memory edit buffer. The plug-in executable could call the editor to inspect and change the text. The University of Waterloo Fortran compiler used this to allow interactive compilation of Fortran programs.

Early personal computer software with plug-in capability included HyperCard and QuarkXPress on the Apple Macintosh, both released in 1987. In 1988, Silicon Beach Software included plug-in capability in Digital Darkroom and SuperPaint.

<text>Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (; 1 May 1881 – 10 April 1955) was a French Jesuit, Catholic priest, scientist, palaeontologist, theologian, philosopher, and teacher. He was Darwinian and progressive in outlook and the author of several influential theological and philosophical books. His mainstream scientific achievements include his palaeontological research in China, taking part in the discovery of the significant Peking Man fossils from the Zhoukoudian cave complex near Beijing. His more speculative ideas, sometimes criticized as pseudoscientific, have included a vitalist conception of the Omega Point. Along with Vladimir Vernadsky, they also contributed to the development of the concept of a noosphere. 

In 1962, the Holy Office condemned several of Teilhard&#x27;s works based on their alleged ambiguities and doctrinal errors. Some eminent Catholic figures, including Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis, have made positive comments on some of his ideas since. The response to his writings by scientists has been divided. Teilhard served in World War I as a stretcher-bearer. He received several citations, and was awarded the Médaille militaire and the Legion of Honor, the highest French order of merit, both military and civil.

==Life==

===Early years===
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was born in the Château of Sarcenat, Orcines, about 2.5 miles north-west of Clermont-Ferrand, Auvergne, French Third Republic, on 1 May 1881, as the fourth of eleven children of librarian Emmanuel Teilhard de Chardin (1844–1932) and Berthe-Adèle, née de Dompierre d&#x27;Hornoys of Picardy. His mother was a great-grandniece of the famous philosopher Voltaire. He inherited the double surname from his father, who was descended on the Teilhard side from an ancient family of magistrates from Auvergne originating in Murat, Cantal, ennobled under Louis XVIII of France.

His father, a graduate of the École Nationale des Chartes, served as a regional librarian and was a keen naturalist with a strong interest in natural science. He collected rocks, insects and plants and encouraged nature studies in the family. Pierre Teilhard&#x27;s spirituality was awakened by his mother. When he was twelve, he went to the Jesuit college of Mongré in Villefranche-sur-Saône, where he completed the Baccalauréat in philosophy and mathematics. In 1899, he entered the Jesuit novitiate in Aix-en-Provence. In October 1900, he began his junior studies at the Collégiale Saint-Michel de Laval. On 25 March 1901, he made his first vows. In 1902, Teilhard completed a licentiate in literature at the University of Caen.

In 1901 and 1902, due to an anti-clerical movement in the French Republic, the government banned the Jesuits and other religious orders from France. This forced the Jesuits to go into exile on the island of Jersey in the United Kingdom. While there, his brother and sister in France died of illnesses and another sister was incapacitated by illness. The unexpected losses of his siblings at young ages caused Teilhard to plan to discontinue his Jesuit studies in science, and change to studying theology. He wrote that he changed his mind after his Jesuit novice master encouraged him to follow science as a legitimate way to God. Due to his strength in science subjects, he was despatched to teach physics and chemistry at the Collège de la Sainte Famille in Cairo, Khedivate of Egypt from 1905 until 1908. From there he wrote in a letter: &quot;[I]t is the dazzling of the East foreseen and drunk greedily ... in its lights, its vegetation, its fauna and its deserts.&quot;

For the next four years he was a Scholastic at &quot;Ore Place&quot; in Hastings, East Sussex where he acquired his theological formation. There he synthesized his scientific, philosophical and theological knowledge in the light of evolution. At that time he read &quot;Creative Evolution&quot; by Henri Bergson, about which he wrote that &quot;the only effect that brilliant book had upon me was to provide fuel at just the right moment, and very briefly, for a fire that was already consuming my heart and mind.&quot; Bergson was a French philosopher who was influential in the traditions of analytic philosophy and continental philosophy. His ideas were influential on Teilhard&#x27;s views on matter, life, and energy. On 24 August 1911, aged 30, Teilhard was ordained a priest.

In the ensuing years, Bergson’s protege, the mathematician and philosopher Édouard Le Roy, was appointed successor to Bergson at the College de France. In 1921, Le Roy and Teilhard became friends and met weekly for long discussions. Teilhard wrote: &quot;I loved him like a father, and owed him a very great debt . . . he gave me confidence, enlarged my mind, and served as a spokesman for my ideas, then taking shape, on “hominization” and the “noosphere.” Le Roy later wrote in one of his books: &quot;I have so often and for so long talked over with Pierre Teilhard the views expressed here that neither of us can any longer pick out his own contribution.”

==Academic and scientific career==
===Geology===
His father&#x27;s strong interest in natural science and geology instilled the same in Teilhard from an early age, and would continue throughout his lifetime. As a child, Teilhard was intensely interested in the stones and rocks on his family&#x27;s land and the neighboring regions. His father helped him develop his skills of observation. At the University of Paris, he studied geology, botany and zoology. After the French government banned all religious orders from France and the Jesuits were exiled to the island of Jersey in the UK, Teilhard deepened his geology knowledge by studying the rocks and landscape of the island.

In 1920, he became a lecturer in geology at the Catholic University of Paris, and later a professor. He earned his doctorate in 1922. In 1923 he was hired to do geological research on expeditions in China by the Jesuitical scientist and priest Emile Licent. In 1914, Licent with the sponsorship of the Jesuits founded one of the first museums in China and the first museum of natural science: the Musée Hoangho Paiho. In its first eight years, the museum was housed in the Chongde Hall of the Jesuits. In 1922, with the support of the Catholic Church and the French Concession, Licent built a special building for the museum on the land adjacent to the Tsin Ku University, which was founded by the Jesuits in China. 

With help from Teilhard and others, Licent collected over 200,000 paleontology, animal, plant, ancient human, and rock specimens for the museum, which still make up more than half of its 380,000 specimens. Many of the publications and writings of the museum and its related institute were included in the world&#x27;s database of zoological, botanical, and palaeontological literature, which is still an important basis for examining the early scientific records of the various disciplines of biology in northern China.

Teilhard and Licent were the first to discover and examine the Shuidonggou (水洞沟) (Ordos Upland, Inner Mongolia) archaeological site in northern China. Recent analysis of flaked stone artifacts from the most recent (1980) excavation at this site has identified an assemblage which constitutes the southernmost occurrence of an Initial Upper Paleolithic blade technology proposed to have originated in the Altai region of Southern Siberia. The lowest levels of the site are now dated from 40,000 to 25,000 years ago.

Teilhard spent the periods between 1926-1935 and 1939-1945 studying and researching the geology and palaeontology of the region. Among other accomplishments, he improved understanding of China’s sedimentary deposits and established approximate ages for various layers. He also produced a geological map of China. It was during the period 1926-1935 that he joined the excavation that discovered Peking Man.

=== Paleontology ===
From 1912 to 1914, Teilhard began his palaeontology education by working in the laboratory of the French National Museum of Natural History, studying the mammals of the middle Tertiary period. Later he studied elsewhere in Europe. This included spending 5 days over the course of a 3-month period in the middle of 1913 as a volunteer assistant helping to dig with Arthur Smith Woodward and Charles Dawson at the Piltdown site. Teilhard’s brief time assisting with digging there occurred many months after the discovery of the first fragments of the fraudulent &quot;Piltdown Man&quot;. Stephen Jay Gould judged that Pierre Teilhard de Chardin conspired with Dawson in the Piltdown forgery. Most Teilhard experts (including all three Teilhard biographers) and many scientists (including the scientists who uncovered the hoax and investigated it) have rejected the suggestion that he participated, and say that he did not. 

Anthropologist H. James Birx wrote that Teilhard „had questioned the validity of this fossil evidence from the very beginning, one positive result was that the young geologist and seminarian now became particularly interested in palaeoanthropology as the science of fossil hominids.“ Marcellin Boule, an palaeontologist and anthropologist, who as early as 1915 had recognized the non-hominid origins of the Piltdown finds, gradually guided Teilhard towards human paleontology. Boule was the editor of the journal &quot;L’Anthropologie&quot; and the founder of two other scientific journals. He was also a professor at the Parisian Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle for 34 years, and for many years director of the museum&#x27;s Institute of Human Paleontology. 

It was there that Teilhard became a friend of Henri Breuil, a Catholic priest, archaeologist, anthropologist, ethnologist and geologist. In 1913, Teilhard and Breuil did excavations at the prehistoric painted Cave of El Castillo in Spain. The cave contains the oldest known cave painting in the world. The site is divided into about 19 archeological layers in a sequence beginning in the Proto-Aurignacian and ending in the Bronze Age. 

Later after his return to China in 1926, Teilhard was hired by the Cenozoic Laboratory at the Peking Union Medical College. Starting in 1928, he joined other geologists and palaeontologists to excavate the sedimentary layers in the Western Hills near Zhoukoudian. At this site, the scientists discovered the so-called Peking man (Sinanthropus pekinensis), a fossil hominid dating back at least 350,000 years, which is part of the Homo erectus phase of human evolution. Teilhard became world-known as a result of his accessible explanations of the Sinanthropus discovery. He also himself made major contributions to the geology of this site. Teilhard&#x27;s long stay in China gave him more time to think and write about evolution, as well as continue his scientific research. 

After the Peking Man discoveries, Breuil joined Teilhard at the site in 1931 and confirmed the presence of stone tools.

=== Scientific writings ===
During his career, Teilhard published many dozens of scientific papers in scholarly scientific journals. When they were published in collections as books, they took up 11 volumes. John Allen Grim, the co-founder and co-director of the Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology, said: &quot;I think you have to distinguish between the hundreds of papers that Teilhard wrote in a purely scientific vein, about which there is no controversy. In fact, the papers made him one of the top two or three geologists of the Asian continent. So this man knew what science was. What he&#x27;s doing in &quot;The Phenomenon&quot; and most of the popular essays that have made him controversial is working pretty much alone to try to synthesize what he&#x27;s learned about through scientific discovery - more than with scientific method - what scientific discoveries tell us about the nature of ultimate reality.” Grim said those writing were controversial to some scientists because Teilhard combined theology and metaphysics with science, and controversial to some religious leaders for the same reason. 

===Service in World War I===
Mobilized in December 1914, Teilhard served in World War I as a stretcher-bearer in the 8th Moroccan Rifles. Priests were mobilized in the France of the First World War era, and not as military chaplains but as either stretcher-bearers or actual fighting soldiers. For his valor, he received several citations, including the Médaille militaire and the Legion of Honor.

During the war, he developed his reflections in his diaries and in letters to his cousin, Marguerite Teillard-Chambon, who later published a collection of them. (See section below) He later wrote: &quot;...the war was a meeting ... with the Absolute.&quot; In 1916, he wrote his first essay: &quot;La Vie Cosmique&quot; (&quot;Cosmic life&quot;), where his scientific and philosophical thought was revealed just as his mystical life. While on leave from the military he pronounced his solemn vows as a Jesuit in Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon on 26 May 1918. In August 1919, in Jersey, he wrote &quot;Puissance spirituelle de la Matière&quot; (&quot;The Spiritual Power of Matter&quot;).

At the University of Paris, Teilhard pursued three unit degrees of natural science: geology, botany, and zoology. His thesis treated the mammals of the French lower Eocene and their stratigraphy. After 1920, he lectured in geology at the Catholic Institute of Paris and after earning a science doctorate in 1922 became an assistant professor there.

===Research in China===
In 1923 he traveled to China with Father Émile Licent, who was in charge of a significant laboratory collaboration between the National Museum of Natural History and Marcellin Boule&#x27;s laboratory in Tianjin. Licent carried out considerable basic work in connection with Catholic missionaries who accumulated observations of a scientific nature in their spare time.

Teilhard wrote several essays, including &quot;La Messe sur le Monde&quot; (the &quot;Mass on the World&quot;), in the Ordos Desert. In the following year, he continued lecturing at the Catholic Institute and participated in a cycle of conferences for the students of the Engineers&#x27; Schools. Two theological essays on original sin were sent to a theologian at his request on a purely personal basis:
* &quot;Chute, Rédemption et Géocentrie&quot; (&quot;Fall, Redemption and Geocentry&quot;) (July 1920)
* &quot;Notes sur quelques représentations historiques possibles du Péché originel&quot; (&quot;Note on Some Possible Historical Representations of Original Sin&quot;) (Works, Tome X, Spring 1922)

The Church required him to give up his lecturing at the Catholic Institute in order to continue his geological research in China. Teilhard traveled again to China in April 1926. He would remain there for about twenty years, with many voyages throughout the world. He settled until 1932 in Tianjin with Émile Licent, then in Beijing. Teilhard made five geological research expeditions in China between 1926 and 1935. They enabled him to establish a general geological map of China.

In 1926–27, after a missed campaign in Gansu, Teilhard traveled in the Sanggan River Valley near Kalgan (Zhangjiakou) and made a tour in Eastern Mongolia. He wrote &quot;Le Milieu Divin&quot; (&quot;The Divine Milieu&quot;). Teilhard prepared the first pages of his main work &quot;Le Phénomène Humain&quot; (&quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot;). The Holy See refused the Imprimatur for &quot;Le Milieu Divin&quot; in 1927. 
He joined the ongoing excavations of the Peking Man Site at Zhoukoudian as an advisor in 1926 and continued in the role for the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the China Geological Survey following its founding in 1928. Teilhard resided in Manchuria with Émile Licent, staying in western Shanxi and northern Shaanxi with the Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian and with Davidson Black, Chairman of the China Geological Survey.

After a tour in Manchuria in the area of Greater Khingan with Chinese geologists, Teilhard joined the team of American Expedition Center-Asia in the Gobi Desert, organized in June and July by the American Museum of Natural History with Roy Chapman Andrews. Henri Breuil and Teilhard discovered that the Peking Man, the nearest relative of &quot;Anthropopithecus&quot; from Java, was a &quot;faber&quot; (worker of stones and controller of fire). Teilhard wrote &quot;L&#x27;Esprit de la Terre&quot; (&quot;The Spirit of the Earth&quot;).

Teilhard took part as a scientist in the Croisière Jaune (Yellow Cruise) financed by André Citroën in Central Asia. Northwest of Beijing in Kalgan, he joined the Chinese group who joined the second part of the team, the Pamir group, in Aksu City. He remained with his colleagues for several months in Ürümqi, capital of Xinjiang. In 1933, Rome ordered him to give up his post in Paris. Teilhard subsequently undertook several explorations in the south of China. He traveled in the valleys of the Yangtze and Sichuan in 1934, then, the following year, in Guangxi and Guangdong.

During all these years, Teilhard contributed considerably to the constitution of an international network of research in human paleontology related to the whole of eastern and southeastern Asia. He would be particularly associated in this task with two friends, Davidson Black and the Scot George Brown Barbour. Often he would visit France or the United States, only to leave these countries for further expeditions.

===World travels===
From 1927 to 1928, Teilhard was based in Paris. He journeyed to Leuven, Belgium, and to Cantal and Ariège, France. Between several articles in reviews, he met new people such as Paul Valéry and , who were to help him in issues with the Catholic Church.

Answering an invitation from Henry de Monfreid, Teilhard undertook a journey of two months in Obock, in Harar in the Ethiopian Empire, and in Somalia with his colleague Pierre Lamarre, a geologist, before embarking in Djibouti to return to Tianjin. While in China, Teilhard developed a deep and personal friendship with Lucile Swan.

During 1930–1931, Teilhard stayed in France and in the United States. During a conference in Paris, Teilhard stated: &quot;For the observers of the Future, the greatest event will be the sudden appearance of a collective humane conscience and a human work to make.&quot; From 1932 to 1933, he began to meet people to clarify issues with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith regarding &quot;Le Milieu divin&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Esprit de la Terre&quot;. He met Helmut de Terra, a German geologist in the International Geology Congress in Washington, D.C.

Teilhard participated in the 1935 Yale–Cambridge expedition in northern and central India with the geologist Helmut de Terra and Patterson, who verified their assumptions on Indian Paleolithic civilisations in Kashmir and the Salt Range Valley. He then made a short stay in Java, on the invitation of Dutch paleontologist Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald to the site of Java Man. A second cranium, more complete, was discovered. Professor von Koenigswald had also found a tooth in a Chinese apothecary shop in 1934 that he believed belonged to a three-meter-tall ape, &quot;Gigantopithecus,&quot; which lived between one hundred thousand and around a million years ago. Fossilized teeth and bone (&quot;dragon bones&quot;) are often ground into powder and used in some branches of traditional Chinese medicine.

In 1937, Teilhard wrote &quot;Le Phénomène spirituel&quot; (&quot;The Phenomenon of the Spirit&quot;) on board the boat Empress of Japan, where he met Sylvia Brett, Ranee of Sarawak The ship took him to the United States. He received the Mendel Medal granted by Villanova University during the Congress of Philadelphia, in recognition of his works on human paleontology. He made a speech about evolution, the origins and the destiny of man. &quot;The New York Times&quot; dated 19 March 1937 presented Teilhard as the Jesuit who held that man descended from monkeys. Some days later, he was to be granted the &quot;Doctor Honoris Causa&quot; distinction from Boston College.

Rome banned his work &quot;L&#x27;Énergie Humaine&quot; in 1939. By this point Teilhard was based again in France, where he was immobilized by malaria. During his return voyage to Beijing he wrote &quot;L&#x27;Energie spirituelle de la Souffrance&quot; (&quot;Spiritual Energy of Suffering&quot;) (Complete Works, tome VII).

In 1941, Teilhard submitted to Rome his most important work, &quot;Le Phénomène Humain&quot;. By 1947, Rome forbade him to write or teach on philosophical subjects. The next year, Teilhard was called to Rome by the Superior General of the Jesuits who hoped to acquire permission from the Holy See for the publication of &quot;Le Phénomène Humain&quot;. However, the prohibition to publish it that was previously issued in 1944 was again renewed. Teilhard was also forbidden to take a teaching post in the Collège de France. Another setback came in 1949, when permission to publish &quot;Le Groupe Zoologique&quot; was refused.

Teilhard was nominated to the French Academy of Sciences in 1950. He was forbidden by his superiors to attend the International Congress of Paleontology in 1955. The Supreme Authority of the Holy Office, in a decree dated 15 November 1957, forbade the works of de Chardin to be retained in libraries, including those of religious institutes. His books were not to be sold in Catholic bookshops and were not to be translated into other languages.

Further resistance to Teilhard&#x27;s work arose elsewhere. In April 1958, all Jesuit publications in Spain (&quot;Razón y Fe&quot;, &quot;Sal Terrae&quot;,&quot;Estudios de Deusto&quot;, etc.) carried a notice from the Spanish Provincial of the Jesuits that Teilhard&#x27;s works had been published in Spanish without previous ecclesiastical examination and in defiance of the decrees of the Holy See. A decree of the Holy Office dated 30 June 1962, under the authority of Pope John XXIII, warned:

The Diocese of Rome on 30 September 1963 required Catholic booksellers in Rome to withdraw his works as well as those that supported his views.

===Death===
Teilhard died in New York City, where he was in residence at the Jesuit Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue. On 15 March 1955, at the house of his diplomat cousin Jean de Lagarde, Teilhard told friends he hoped he would die on Easter Sunday. On the evening of Easter Sunday, 10 April 1955, during an animated discussion at the apartment of Rhoda de Terra, his personal assistant since 1949, Teilhard suffered a heart attack and died. He was buried in the cemetery for the New York Province of the Jesuits at the Jesuit novitiate, St. Andrew-on-Hudson, in Hyde Park, New York. With the moving of the novitiate, the property was sold to the Culinary Institute of America in 1970.
==Teachings==

Teilhard de Chardin wrote two comprehensive works, &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot; and &quot;The Divine Milieu&quot;.

His posthumously published book, &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot;, set forth a sweeping account of the unfolding of the cosmos and the evolution of matter to humanity, to ultimately a reunion with Christ. In the book, Teilhard abandoned literal interpretations of creation in the Book of Genesis in favor of allegorical and theological interpretations. The unfolding of the material cosmos is described from primordial particles to the development of life, human beings and the noosphere, and finally to his vision of the Omega Point in the future, which is &quot;pulling&quot; all creation towards it. He was a leading proponent of orthogenesis, the idea that evolution occurs in a directional, goal-driven way. Teilhard argued in Darwinian terms with respect to biology, and supported the synthetic model of evolution, but argued in Lamarckian terms for the development of culture, primarily through the vehicle of education. 

Teilhard made a total commitment to the evolutionary process in the 1920s as the core of his spirituality, at a time when other religious thinkers felt evolutionary thinking challenged the structure of conventional Christian faith. He committed himself to what he thought the evidence showed.

Teilhard made sense of the universe by assuming it had a vitalist evolutionary process. He interpreted complexity as the axis of evolution of matter into a geosphere, a biosphere, into consciousness (in man), and then to supreme consciousness (the Omega Point). Jean Houston&#x27;s story of meeting Teilhard illustrates this point.

Teilhard&#x27;s unique relationship to both paleontology and Catholicism allowed him to develop a highly progressive, cosmic theology which took into account his evolutionary studies. Teilhard recognized the importance of bringing the Church into the modern world, and approached evolution as a way of providing ontological meaning for Christianity, particularly creation theology. For Teilhard, evolution was &quot;the natural landscape where the history of salvation is situated.&quot;

Teilhard&#x27;s cosmic theology is largely predicated on his interpretation of Pauline scripture, particularly Colossians 1:15-17 (especially verse 1:17b) and 1 Corinthians 15:28. He drew on the Christocentrism of these two Pauline passages to construct a cosmic theology which recognizes the absolute primacy of Christ. He understood creation to be &quot;a teleological process towards union with the Godhead, effected through the incarnation and redemption of Christ, &#x27;in whom all things hold together&#x27; (Colossians 1:17).&quot; He further posited that creation would not be complete until each &quot;participated being is totally united with God through Christ in the Pleroma, when God will be &#x27;all in all&#x27; (1 Corinthians 15:28).&quot; 
Teilhard&#x27;s life work was predicated on his conviction that human spiritual development is moved by the same universal laws as material development. He wrote, &quot;...everything is the sum of the past&quot; and &quot;...nothing is comprehensible except through its history. &#x27;Nature&#x27; is the equivalent of &#x27;becoming&#x27;, self-creation: this is the view to which experience irresistibly leads us. ... There is nothing, not even the human soul, the highest spiritual manifestation we know of, that does not come within this universal law.&quot; 

&quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot; represents Teilhard&#x27;s attempt at reconciling his religious faith with his academic interests as a paleontologist. One particularly poignant observation in Teilhard&#x27;s book entails the notion that evolution is becoming an increasingly optional process. Teilhard points to the societal problems of isolation and marginalization as huge inhibitors of evolution, especially since evolution requires a unification of consciousness. He states that &quot;no evolutionary future awaits anyone except in association with everyone else.&quot; Teilhard argued that the human condition necessarily leads to the psychic unity of humankind, though he stressed that this unity can only be voluntary; this voluntary psychic unity he termed &quot;unanimization&quot;. Teilhard also states that &quot;evolution is an ascent toward consciousness&quot;, giving encephalization as an example of early stages, and therefore, signifies a continuous upsurge toward the Omega Point which, for all intents and purposes, is God.

Teilhard also used his perceived correlation between spiritual and material to describe Christ, arguing that Christ not only has a mystical dimension but also takes on a physical dimension as he becomes the organizing principle of the universe—that is, the one who &quot;holds together&quot; the universe. For Teilhard, Christ formed not only the eschatological end toward which his mystical/ecclesial body is oriented, but he also &quot;operates physically in order to regulate all things&quot; becoming &quot;the one from whom all creation receives its stability.&quot; In other words, as the one who holds all things together, &quot;Christ exercises a supremacy over the universe which is physical, not simply juridical. He is the unifying center of the universe and its goal. The function of holding all things together indicates that Christ is not only man and God; he also possesses a third aspect—indeed, a third nature—which is cosmic.&quot; 

In this way, the Pauline description of the Body of Christ was not simply a mystical or ecclesial concept for Teilhard; it is cosmic. This cosmic Body of Christ &quot;extend[s] throughout the universe and compris[es] all things that attain their fulfillment in Christ [so that] ... the Body of Christ is the one single thing that is being made in creation.&quot; Teilhard describes this cosmic amassing of Christ as &quot;Christogenesis&quot;. According to Teilhard, the universe is engaged in Christogenesis as it evolves toward its full realization at Omega, a point which coincides with the fully realized Christ. It is at this point that God will be &quot;all in all&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:28c).

===Eugenics and racism===

Teilhard has been criticized for incorporating elements of scientific racism, social Darwinism, and eugenics into his optimistic thinking about unlimited human progress. He argued in 1929 that racial inequality was rooted in biological difference: &quot;Do the yellows—[the Chinese]—have the same human value as the whites? [Fr.] Licent and many missionaries say that their present inferiority is due to their long history of Paganism. I&#x27;m afraid that this is only a &#x27;declaration of pastors.&#x27; Instead, the cause seems to be the natural racial foundation…&quot; In a letter from 1936 explaining his Omega Point conception, he rejected both the Fascist quest for particularistic hegemony and the Christian/Communist insistence on egalitarianism: &quot;As not all ethnic groups have the same value, they must be dominated, which does not mean they must be despised—quite the reverse … In other words, &quot;at one and the same time&quot; there should be official recognition of: (1) the primacy/priority of the earth over nations; (2) the inequality of peoples and races. Now the &quot;second&quot; point is currently reviled by Communism … and the Church, and the &quot;first&quot; point is similarly reviled by the Fascist systems (and, of course, by less gifted peoples!)&quot;. In the essay &#x27;Human Energy&#x27; (1937), he asked, &quot;What fundamental attitude … should the advancing wing of humanity take to fixed or definitely unprogressive ethnical groups? The earth is a closed and limited surface. To what extent should it tolerate, racially or nationally, areas of lesser activity? More generally still, how should we judge the efforts we lavish in all kinds of hospitals on saving what is so often no more than one of life&#x27;s rejects? … To what extent should not the development of the strong … take precedence over the preservation of the weak?&quot; The theologian John P. Slattery interprets this last remark to suggest &quot;genocidal practices for the sake of eugenics&quot;.

Even after World War II Teilhard continued to argue for racial and individual eugenics in the name of human progress, and denounced the United Nations declaration of the Equality of Races (1950) as &quot;scientifically useless&quot; and &quot;practically dangerous&quot; in a letter to the agency&#x27;s director Jaime Torres Bodet. In 1953, he expressed his frustration at the Church&#x27;s failure to embrace the scientific possibilities for optimising human nature, including by the separation of sexuality from reproduction (a notion later developed e.g. by the second-wave feminist Shulamith Firestone in her 1970 book &quot;The Dialectic of Sex&quot;), and postulated &quot;the absolute right … to try everything right to the end—even in the matter of human biology&quot;. 

The theologian John F. Haught has defended Teilhard from Slattery&#x27;s charge of &quot;persistent attraction to racism, fascism, and genocidal ideas&quot; by pointing out that Teilhard&#x27;s philosophy was not based on racial exclusion but rather on union through differentiation, and that Teilhard took seriously the human responsibility for continuing to remake the world. With regard to union through differentiation, he underlined the importance of understanding properly a quotation used by Slattery in which Teilhard writes, &quot;I hate nationalism and its apparent regressions to the past. But I am very interested in the primacy it returns to the collective. Could a passion for &#x27;the race&#x27; represent a first draft of the Spirit of the Earth?&quot; Writing from China in October 1936, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Teilhard expressed his stance towards the new political movement in Europe, &quot;I am alarmed at the attraction that various kinds of Fascism exert on intelligent (?) people who can see in them nothing but the hope of returning to the Neolithic&quot;. He felt that the choice between what he called &quot;the American, the Italian, or the Russian type&quot; of political economy (i.e. liberal capitalism, Fascist corporatism, Bolshevik Communism) had only &quot;technical&quot; relevance to his search for overarching unity and a philosophy of action.

==Relationship with the Catholic Church==

In 1925, Teilhard was ordered by the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, Włodzimierz Ledóchowski, to leave his teaching position in France and to sign a statement withdrawing his controversial statements regarding the doctrine of original sin. Rather than quit the Society of Jesus, Teilhard obeyed and departed for China.

This was the first of a series of condemnations by a range of ecclesiastical officials that would continue until after Teilhard&#x27;s death. In August 1939, he was told by his Jesuit superior in Beijing, &quot;Father, as an evolutionist and a Communist, you are undesirable here, and will have to return to France as soon as possible&quot;. The climax of these condemnations was a 1962 &quot;monitum&quot; (warning) of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith cautioning on Teilhard&#x27;s works. It said:

The Holy Office did not, however, place any of Teilhard&#x27;s writings on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (Index of Forbidden Books), which still existed during Teilhard&#x27;s lifetime and at the time of the 1962 decree.

Shortly thereafter, prominent clerics mounted a strong theological defense of Teilhard&#x27;s works. Henri de Lubac (later a Cardinal) wrote three comprehensive books on the theology of Teilhard de Chardin in the 1960s. While de Lubac mentioned that Teilhard was less than precise in some of his concepts, he affirmed the orthodoxy of Teilhard de Chardin and responded to Teilhard&#x27;s critics: &quot;We need not concern ourselves with a number of detractors of Teilhard, in whom emotion has blunted intelligence&quot;. Later that decade Joseph Ratzinger, a German theologian who became Pope Benedict XVI, spoke glowingly of Teilhard&#x27;s Christology in Ratzinger&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to Christianity&quot;:

On 20 July 1981, the Holy See stated that, after consultation of cardinals Casaroli and Šeper, the letter did not change the position of the warning issued by the Holy Office on 30 June 1962, which pointed out that Teilhard&#x27;s work contained ambiguities and grave doctrinal errors.

Cardinal Ratzinger in his book &quot;The Spirit of the Liturgy&quot; incorporates Teilhard&#x27;s vision as a touchstone of the Catholic Mass:

Cardinal Avery Dulles said in 2004:

Cardinal Christoph Schönborn wrote in 2007:

In July 2009, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said, &quot;By now, no one would dream of saying that [Teilhard] is a heterodox author who shouldn&#x27;t be studied.&quot;

Pope Francis refers to Teilhard&#x27;s eschatological contribution in his encyclical &quot;Laudato si&#x27;&quot;.

The philosopher Dietrich von Hildebrand criticized severely the work of Teilhard. According to Hildebrand, in a conversation after a lecture by Teilhard: &quot;He (Teilhard) ignored completely the decisive difference between nature and supernature. After a lively discussion in which I ventured a criticism of his ideas, I had an opportunity to speak to Teilhard privately. When our talk touched on St. Augustine, he exclaimed violently: &#x27;Don&#x27;t mention that unfortunate man; he spoiled everything by introducing the supernatural.&#x27;&quot; Von Hildebrand writes that Teilhardism is incompatible with Christianity, substitutes efficiency for sanctity, dehumanizes man, and describes love as merely cosmic energy.

==Evaluations by scientists==

=== Julian Huxley ===
Julian Huxley, the evolutionary biologist, in the preface to the 1955 edition of &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot;, praised the thought of Teilhard de Chardin for looking at the way in which human development needs to be examined within a larger integrated universal sense of evolution, though admitting he could not follow Teilhard all the way. In the publication Encounter, Huxley wrote: &quot;The force and purity of Teilhard&#x27;s thought and expression ... has given the world a picture not only of rare clarity but pregnant with compelling conclusions.&quot;

===Theodosius Dobzhansky===
Theodosius Dobzhansky, writing in 1973, drew upon Teilhard&#x27;s insistence that evolutionary theory provides the core of how man understands his relationship to nature, calling him &quot;one of the great thinkers of our age&quot;. Dobzhansky was renowned as the president of four prestigious scientific associations: the Genetics Society of America, the American Society of Naturalists, the Society for the Study of Evolution and the American Society of Zoologists. He also called Teilhard &quot;one of the greatest intellects of our time.&quot;

=== Daniel Dennett ===
Daniel Dennett claimed &quot;it has become clear to the point of unanimity among scientists that Teilhard offered nothing serious in the way of an alternative to orthodoxy; the ideas that were peculiarly his were confused, and the rest was just bombastic redescription of orthodoxy.&quot;

=== David Sloan Wilson ===
In 2019, evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson praised Teilhard&#x27;s book &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot; as &quot;scientifically prophetic in many ways&quot;, and considers his own work as an updated version of it, commenting that &quot;[m]odern evolutionary theory shows that what Teilhard meant by the Omega Point is achievable in the foreseeable future.&quot;

=== Robert Francoeur ===
Robert Francoeur (1931-2012), the American biologist, said the Phenomenon of Man &quot;will be one of the few books that will be remembered after the dust of the century has settled on many of its companions.&quot;

===Stephen Jay Gould===
In an essay published in the magazine &quot;Natural History&quot; (and later compiled as the 16th essay in his book &quot;Hen&#x27;s Teeth and Horse&#x27;s Toes&quot;), American biologist Stephen Jay Gould made a case for Teilhard&#x27;s guilt in the Piltdown Hoax, arguing that Teilhard has made several compromising slips of the tongue in his correspondence with paleontologist Kenneth Oakley, in addition to what Gould termed to be his &quot;suspicious silence&quot; about Piltdown despite having been, at that moment in time, an important milestone in his career. In a later book, Gould claims that Steven Rose wrote that &quot;Teilhard is revered as a mystic of genius by some, but among most biologists is seen as little more than a charlatan.&quot;

Numerous scientists and Teilhard experts have refuted Gould’s theories about Teilhard’s guilt in the hoax, saying they are based on inaccuracies. In an article in New Scientist in September, 1981, Peter Costello said claims that Teilhard had been silent were factually wrong: “Much else of what is said about Teilhard is also wrong. …. After the exposure of the hoax, he did not refuse to make a statement; he gave a statement to the press on 26 November, 1953, which was published in New York and London the next day. ... If questions needed to be asked about Teilhard&#x27;s role in the Piltdown affair, they could have been asked when he was in London during the summer of 1953. They were not asked. But enough is now known to prove Teilhard innocent of all involvement in the hoax.” Teilhard also wrote multiple letters about the hoax at the request of and in reply to Oakley, one of the 3 scientists who uncovered it, in an effort to help them get to the bottom of what occurred 40 years earlier. 

Another of the three scientists, S.J. Weiner said he spoke to Teilhard extensively about Piltdown and &quot;He (Teilhard) discussed all the points that I put to him perfectly frankly and openly.&quot; Weiner spent years investigating who was responsible for the hoax and concluded that Charles Dawson was the sole culprit. He also said: &quot;Gould would have you accept that Oakley was the same mind (as himself); but it is not so. When Gould&#x27;s article came out Oakley dissociated himself from it. ...I have seen Oakley recently and he has no reservations... about his belief that Teilhard had nothing to do with the planting of this material and manufacture of the fraud.&quot;

In November, 1981, Oakley himself published a letter in New Scientist saying: &quot;There is no proved factual evidence known to me that supports the premise that Father Teilhard de Chardin gave Charles Dawson a piece of fossil elephant molar tooth as a souvenir of his time spent in North Africa. This faulty thread runs throughout the reconstruction ... After spending a year thinking about this accusation, I have at last become convinced that it is erroneous.&quot; Oakley also pointed out that after Teilhard got his degree in paleontology and gained experience in the field, he published scientific articles that show he found the scientific claims of the two Piltdown leaders to be incongruous, and that Teilhard did not agree they had discovered an ape-man that was a missing link between apes and humans.

In a comprehensive rebuttal of Gould in America magazine, Mary Lukas said his claims about Teilhard were &quot;patently ridiculous” and “wilder flights of fancy” that were easily disprovable and weak. For example, she notes Teilhard was only briefly and minimally involved in the Piltdown project for four reasons: 1) He was only a student in his early days of studying paleontology. 2) His college was in France and he was at the Piltdown site in Britain for a total of just 5 days over a short period of three months out of the 7-year project. 3) He was simply a volunteer assistant, helping with basic digging. 4) This limited involvement ended prior to the most important claimed discovery, due to his being conscripted to serve in the French army. She added: &quot;Further, according to his letters, both published and unpublished, to friends, Teilhard&#x27;s relationship to Dawson was anything but close.&quot; 

Lukas said Gould made the claims for selfish reasons: “The charge gained Mr. Gould two weeks of useful publicity and prepared reviewers to give a friendly reception to the collection of essays” that he was about to publish. She said Teilhard was “beyond doubt the most famous of” all the people who were involved in the excavations” and “the one who could gather headlines most easily…. The shock value of the suggestion that the philosopher-hero was also a criminal was stunning.” Two years later, Lukas published a more detailed article in the British scholarly journal Antiquity in which she further refuted Gould, including an extensive timeline of events. 

Winifred McCulloch wrote a very detailed rebuttal of Gould, calling his claim “highly subjective,” “very idiosyncratic,” filled with clear “weaknesses” and “shown to be impossible.” She said Weiner had criticized Gould&#x27;s accusations in a talk at Georgetown University in 1981. She also noted that Oakley wrote in a letter to Lukas in 1981 that her article in America constituted &quot;a total refutation of Gould&#x27;s interpretation of Teilhard&#x27;s letters to me in 1953-1954. . . . You have . . . unearthed evidence that will seriously undermine Gould&#x27;s confidence in having any evidence against Teilhard in regard to what he (Teilhard) said in his letters to me.&quot; She wrote: &quot;Gould&#x27;s method of presenting his main argument might be called &quot;inferred intent&quot; - projecting onto Teilhard ways of thinking and acting that have no evidential base and are completely foreign to all we know of Teilhard. With Gould it seems that the guilty verdict came first, then he created a persona to fit the crime.” 

===Peter Medawar===
In 1961, British immunologist and Nobel laureate Peter Medawar wrote a scornful review of &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot; for the journal &quot;Mind&quot;: &quot;the greater part of it [...] is nonsense, tricked out with a variety of metaphysical conceits, and its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself. [...] Teilhard practiced an intellectually unexacting kind of science [...]. He has no grasp of what makes a logical argument or what makes for proof. He does not even preserve the common decencies of scientific writing, though his book is professedly a scientific treatise. [...] Teilhard habitually and systematically cheats with words [...], uses in metaphor words like energy, tension, force, impetus, and dimension as if they retained the weight and thrust of their special scientific usages. [...] It is the style that creates the illusion of content.&quot;

In 2014, Donald Wayne Viney evaluated Medawar&#x27;s review and concluded that the case made against Teilhard was &quot;remarkably thin, marred by misrepresentations and elementary philosophical blunders.&quot; These defects, Viney noted, were uncharacteristic of Medawar&#x27;s other work.

In another response, John Allen Grim said when Teilhard &quot;wrote The Phenomenon of Man … he was using science there in a very broad sense. What he was really looking for was to be actually more radically empirical than conventional science is. Conventional science leaves out so much that&#x27;s really there, especially our own subjectivity and some of the other things that are qualitative and value laden that are going on in the world. That science … has abstracted from values, meaning, subjectivity, purpose, God, and talked only about physical causation. Teilhard knew this, because when he wrote his [science journal] papers, he didn&#x27;t bring God, value and so forth into it. But when he wrote The Phenomenon, he was doing something different. But it&#x27;s not against the spirit of science. It was to actually expand the empirical orientation of science to take into account things that science unfortunately leaves out, like consciousness, for example, which today, in a materialist worldview, doesn&#x27;t even exist, and yet it&#x27;s the most palpable experience that any of us has. So if you try to construct a worldview that leaves out something so vital and important as mind to subjectivity, then that&#x27;s unempirical, that&#x27;s irrelevant. What we need is a radically empirical approach to the world that includes within what he calls hyperphysics, the experience of consciousness and also the experiences of faith, religions.”

===Richard Dawkins===
Evolutionary biologist and a New Atheist Richard Dawkins called Medawar&#x27;s review &quot;devastating&quot; and &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot; &quot;the quintessence of bad poetic science&quot;.

=== Karl Stern ===
Karl Stern, the neurobiologist of the Montreal Neurological Institute, wrote: &quot;It happens so rarely that science and wisdom are blended as they were in the person of Teilhard de Chardin.&quot;

=== George Gaylord Simpson ===
George Gaylord Simpson felt that if Teilhard were right, the lifework &quot;of Huxley, Dobzhansky, and hundreds of others was not only wrong, but meaningless&quot;, and was mystified by their public support for him. He considered Teilhard a friend and his work in paleontology extensive and important, but expressed strongly adverse views of his contributions as scientific theorist and philosopher.

=== William G. Pollard ===
William G. Pollard, the physicist and founder of the prestigious Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies (and its director until 1974), praised Teilhard’s work as &quot;A fascinating and powerful presentation of the amazing fact of the emergence of man in the unfolding drama of the cosmos.&quot;

=== John Barrow and Frank Tipler ===
John Barrow and Frank Tipler, both physicists and cosmologists, base much of their work on Teilhard and use some of his key terms such as the Omega point. However, Manuel Alfonseca, author of 50 books and 200 technical articles, said in an article in the quarterly Popular Science: &quot;Barrow and Tipler have not understood Teilhard (apparently they have just read &#x27;&quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot;&#x27;, at least this is the only work by Teilhard they mention). In fact, they have got everything backwards.&quot;

=== Wolfgang Smith ===
Wolfgang Smith, an American scientist versed in Catholic theology, devotes an entire book to the critique of Teilhard&#x27;s doctrine, which he considers neither scientific (assertions without proofs), nor Catholic (personal innovations), nor metaphysical (the &quot;Absolute Being&quot; is not yet absolute), and of which the following elements can be noted (all the words in quotation marks are Teilhard&#x27;s, quoted by Smith):

==== Evolution ====
Smith claims that for Teilhard, evolution is not only a scientific theory but an irrefutable truth &quot;immune from any subsequent contradiction by experience&quot;; it constitutes the foundation of his doctrine. Matter becomes spirit and humanity moves towards a super-humanity thanks to complexification (physico-chemical, then biological, then human), socialization, scientific research and technological and cerebral development; the explosion of the first atomic bomb is one of its milestones, while waiting for &quot;the vitalization of matter by the creation of super-molecules, the remodeling of the human organism by means of hormones, control of heredity and sex by manipulation of genes and chromosomes [...]&quot;.

==== Matter and spirit ====
Teilhard maintains that the human spirit (which he identifies with the &quot;anima&quot; and not with the &quot;spiritus&quot;) originates in a matter which becomes more and more complex until it produces life, then consciousness, then the consciousness of being conscious, holding that the immaterial can emerge from the material. At the same time, he supports the idea of the presence of embryos of consciousness from the very genesis of the universe: &quot;We are logically forced to assume the existence [...] of some sort of psyche&quot; infinitely diffuse in the smallest particle.

==== Theology ====
Smith believes that since Teilhard affirms that &quot;God creates evolutively&quot;, he denies the Book of Genesis, not only because it attests that God created man, but that he created him in his own image, thus perfect and complete, then that man fell, that is to say the opposite of an ascending evolution. That which is metaphysically and theologically &quot;above&quot; - symbolically speaking - becomes for Teilhard &quot;ahead&quot;, yet to come; even God, who is neither perfect nor timeless, evolves in symbiosis with the World, which Teilhard, a resolute pantheist, venerates as the equal of the Divine. As for Christ, not only is he there to activate the wheels of progress and complete the evolutionary ascent, but he himself evolves..

==== New religion ====
As he wrote to a cousin: &quot;What dominates my interests increasingly is the effort to establish in me and define around me a new religion (call it a better Christianity, if you will)...&quot;, and elsewhere: &quot;a Christianity re-incarnated for a second time in the spiritual energies of Matter&quot;. The more Teilhard refines his theories, the more he emancipates himself from established Christian doctrine: a &quot;religion of the earth&quot; must replace a &quot;religion of heaven&quot;. By their common faith in Man, he writes, Christians, Marxists, Darwinists, materialists of all kinds will ultimately join around the same summit: the Christic Omega Point.

=== Lucien Cuénot ===
Lucien Cuénot, the biologist who proved that Mendelism applied to animals as well as plants through his experiments with mice, wrote: &quot;Teilhard&#x27;s greatness lay in this, that in a world ravaged by neurosis he provided an answer to out modern anguish and reconciled man with the cosmos and with himself by offering him an &quot;ideal of humanity that, through a higher and consciously willed synthesis, would restore the instinctive equilibrium enjoyed in ages of primitive simplicity.&quot; Mendelism is a group of biological inheritance principles developed by the Catholic friar-scientist Gregor Mendel. Though for many years Mendelism was rejected by most biologists and other scientists, its principles - combined with the Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory of inheritance - eventually became the core of classical genetics.

==Legacy==
Brian Swimme wrote &quot;Teilhard was one of the first scientists to realize that the human and the universe are inseparable. The only universe we know about is a universe that brought forth the human.&quot;

George Gaylord Simpson named the most primitive and ancient genus of true primate, the Eocene genus &quot;Teilhardina&quot;.

On June 25, 1947 Teilhard was honored by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for &quot;Outstanding services to the intellectual and scientific influence of France&quot; and was promoted to the rank of Officer in the &quot;Legion of Honor&quot;. In 1950, Teilhard was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences. 

=== Influence on arts and culture ===
Teilhard and his work continue to influence the arts and culture. 

* Characters based on Teilhard appear in several novels, including Jean Telemond in Morris West&#x27;s &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; (mentioned by name and quoted by Oskar Werner playing Fr. Telemond in the movie version of the novel). 
* In Dan Simmons&#x27; 1989–97 &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot;, Teilhard de Chardin has been canonized a saint in the far future.
* His work inspires the anthropologist priest character, Paul Duré. When Duré becomes Pope, he takes &quot;Teilhard I&quot; as his regnal name. 
* Teilhard appears as a minor character in the play &quot;Fake&quot; by Eric Simonson, staged by Chicago&#x27;s Steppenwolf Theatre Company in 2009, involving a fictional solution to the infamous Piltdown Man hoax.

There is a broad range of references to Teilhard ranging from quotations, as when an auto mechanic cites Teilhard in Philip K. Dick&#x27;s &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; to philosophical underpinning of an entire plot, as Teilhard&#x27;s work does in Julian May&#x27;s 1987–94 Galactic Milieu Series. 

* Teilhard also plays a major role in Annie Dillard&#x27;s 1999 &quot;For the Time Being&quot;. 
* Teilhard is mentioned by name and the Omega Point briefly explained in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s and Stephen Baxter&#x27;s &quot;The Light of Other Days&quot;. 
* The title of the short-story collection &quot;Everything That Rises Must Converge&quot; by Flannery O&#x27;Connor is a reference to Teilhard&#x27;s work. 
* The American novelist Don DeLillo&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;Point Omega&quot; borrows its title and some of its ideas from Teilhard de Chardin. 
* Robert Wright, in his book &quot;&quot;, compares his own naturalistic thesis that biological and cultural evolution are directional and, possibly, purposeful, with Teilhard&#x27;s ideas.
* Teilhard&#x27;s work also inspired philosophical ruminations by Italian laureate architect Paolo Soleri and Mexican writer Margarita Casasús Altamirano

In artworks: 

* s French painter Alfred Manessier&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Offrande de la terre ou Hommage à Teilhard de Chardin&quot;
* and American sculptor Frederick Hart&#x27;s acrylic sculpture &quot;The Divine Milieu: Homage to Teilhard de Chardin&quot;. 
* A sculpture of the Omega Point by Henry Setter, with a quote from Teilhard de Chardin, can be found at the entrance to the Roesch Library at the University of Dayton. 
* The Spanish painter Salvador Dalí was fascinated by Teilhard de Chardin and the Omega Point theory. His 1959 painting &quot;The Ecumenical Council&quot; is said to represent the &quot;interconnectedness&quot; of the Omega Point.
* Edmund Rubbra&#x27;s 1968 Symphony No. 8 is titled &quot;Hommage à Teilhard de Chardin&quot;.

&quot;The Embracing Universe&quot;, an oratorio for choir and 7 instruments, composed by Justin Grounds to a libretto by Fred LaHaye saw its first performance in 2019. It is based on the life and thought of Teilhard de Chardin.

College campuses: 

* A building at the University of Manchester, 
* residence dormitories at Gonzaga University, 
* residence dormitories at Seattle University.

&quot;The De Chardin Project&quot;, a play celebrating Teilhard&#x27;s life, ran from 20 November to 14 December 2014 in Toronto, Canada. &quot;The Evolution of Teilhard de Chardin&quot;, a documentary film on Teilhard&#x27;s life, was scheduled for release in 2015.

Founded in 1978, George Addair based much of Omega Vector on Teilhard&#x27;s work.

The American physicist Frank J. Tipler has further developed Teilhard&#x27;s Omega Point concept in two controversial books, &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot; and the more theologically based Physics of Christianity. While keeping the central premise of Teilhard&#x27;s Omega Point (i.e. a universe evolving towards a maximum state of complexity and consciousness) Tipler has supplanted some of the more mystical/ theological elements of the OPT with his own scientific and mathematical observations (as well as some elements borrowed from Freeman Dyson&#x27;s eternal intelligence theory).

In 1972, the Uruguayan priest Juan Luis Segundo, in his five-volume series &quot;A Theology for Artisans of a New Humanity,&quot; wrote that Teilhard &quot;noticed the profound analogies existing between the conceptual elements used by the natural sciences—all of them being based on the hypothesis of a general evolution of the universe.&quot;

=== Influence of his cousin Marguerite Teilard Chambon ===
, (alias Claude Aragonnès) was a French writer who edited and had published three volumes of correspondence with her cousin, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, &quot;La genèse d&#x27;une pensée&quot; (&quot;The Making of a Mind&quot;) being the last, after her own death in 1959. She furnished each with an introduction. Marguerite, a year older than Teilhard, was considered among those who knew and understood him best. They had shared a childhood in Auvergne; she it was who encouraged him to undertake a doctorate in science at the Sorbonne; she eased his entry into the Catholic Institute, through her connection to Emmanuel de Margerie and she introduced him to the intellectual life of Paris. Throughout the First World War, she corresponded with him, acting as a &quot;midwife&quot; to his thinking, helping his thought to emerge and honing it. In September 1959 she participated in a gathering organised at Saint-Babel, near Issoire, devoted to Teilhard&#x27;s philosophical contribution. On the way home to Chambon-sur-Lac, she was fatally injured in a road traffic accident. Her sister, Alice, completed the final preparations for the publication of the final volume of her cousin Teilhard&#x27;s wartime letters.

===Influence on the New Age movement===
Teilhard has had a profound influence on the New Age movements and has been described as &quot;perhaps the man most responsible for the spiritualization of evolution in a global and cosmic context&quot;.

===Other===
Fritjof Capra&#x27;s systems theory book &quot;The Turning Point: Science, Society, and the Rising Culture&quot; positively contrasts Teilhard to Darwinian evolution.

==Bibliography==
The dates in parentheses are the dates of first publication in French and English. Most of these works were written years earlier, but Teilhard&#x27;s ecclesiastical order forbade him to publish them because of their controversial nature. The essay collections are organized by subject rather than date, thus each one typically spans many years.

<text>Phutball (short for Philosopher&#x27;s Football) is a two-player abstract strategy board game described in Elwyn Berlekamp, John Horton Conway, and Richard K. Guy&#x27;s &quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot;.

== Rules ==
Phutball is played on the intersections of a 19×15 grid using one white stone and as many black stones as needed.
In this article the two players are named Ohs (O) and Eks (X).
The board is labeled A through P (omitting I) from left to right and 1 to 19 from bottom to top from Ohs&#x27; perspective. 
Rows 0 and 20 represent &quot;off the board&quot; beyond rows 1 and 19 respectively.

As specialized phutball boards are hard to come by, the game is usually played on a 19×19 Go board, with a white stone representing the football and black stones representing the men.

The objective is to score goals by using the men (the black stones) to move the football (the white stone) onto or over the opponent&#x27;s goal line (rows 1 or 19). Ohs tries to move the football to rows 19 or 20 and Eks to rows 1 or 0. 
At the start of the game the football is placed on the central point, unless one player gives the other a handicap, in which case the ball starts nearer one player&#x27;s goal.

Players alternate making moves. 
A move is either to add a man to any vacant point on the board or to move the ball. 
There is no difference between men played by Ohs and those played by Eks.

The football is moved by a series of jumps over adjacent men. 
Each jump is to the first vacant point in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally over one or more men. 
The jumped men are then removed from the board (before any subsequent jump occurs). 
This process repeats for as long as there remain men available to be jumped and the player desires. Jumping is optional: there is no requirement to jump. 
In contrast to checkers, multiple men in a row are jumped and removed as a group.

The diagram on the right illustrates a single move consisting of a series of jumps. 
*Ohs moves the football from K6–G9.
*The men on J7 and H8 are removed.
*Ohs moves the football from G9–G11.
*The man on G10 is removed.
*Ohs moves the football from G11–J11.
*The man on H11 is removed.
*Note that the move consisting of K6–G9–J9–G7 would not be legal, as that would jump the man on H8 twice.

If the football ends the move on or over the opponent&#x27;s goal line then a goal has been scored. 
If the football passes through a goal line, but ends up elsewhere due to further jumps, the game continues.

== Strategy ==
*Carefully set-up sequences of jumps can be &quot;spoiled&quot; by extending them at critical moments.
*A jump to the left or right edge can be blocked by leaving no vacant points.
*When jumping, it is usually bad to leave an easily used return path for the opponent to &quot;undo&quot; one&#x27;s progress.

== Computational complexity ==
The game is sufficiently complex that checking whether there is a win in one (on an m×n board) is NP-complete. From the starting position, it is not known whether any player has a winning strategy or both players have a drawing strategy, but there exist other configurations from which both players have drawing strategies.
Given an arbitrary board position, with initially a white stone placed in the center, determining whether the current player has a winning strategy is PSPACE-hard.

<text>Papyrus ( ) is a material similar to thick paper that was used in ancient times as a writing surface. It was made from the pith of the papyrus plant, &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot;, a wetland sedge. &quot;Papyrus&quot; (plural: &quot;papyri&quot; or &quot;papyruses&quot;) can also refer to a document written on sheets of such material, joined side by side and rolled up into a scroll, an early form of a book.
Papyrus was first known to have been used in Egypt (at least as far back as the First Dynasty), as the papyrus plant was once abundant across the Nile Delta. It was also used throughout the Mediterranean region. Apart from writing material, ancient Egyptians employed papyrus in the construction of other artifacts, such as reed boats, mats, rope, sandals, and baskets.

== History ==
Papyrus was first manufactured in Egypt as far back as the third millennium BCE. The earliest archaeological evidence of papyrus was excavated in 2012 and 2013 at Wadi al-Jarf, an ancient Egyptian harbor located on the Red Sea coast. These documents, the Diary of Merer, date from –2550 BCE (end of the reign of Khufu). The papyrus rolls describe the last years of building the Great Pyramid of Giza.
For multiple millennia, papyrus was commonly rolled into scrolls as a form of storage. However, at some point late in its history, papyrus began being collected together in the form of codices akin to the modern book. This may have been mimicking the book-form of codices created with parchment. Early Christian writers soon adopted the codex form, and in the Greco-Roman world, it became common to cut sheets from papyrus rolls to form codices. Codices were an improvement on the papyrus scroll, as the papyrus was not pliable enough to fold without cracking, and a long roll, or scroll, was required to create large-volume texts. Papyrus had the advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to produce, but it was fragile and susceptible to both moisture and excessive dryness. Unless the papyrus was of perfect quality, the writing surface was irregular, and the range of media that could be used was also limited.

Papyrus was gradually overtaken in Europe by a rival writing surface that rose in prominence known as parchment, which was made from animal skins. By the beginning of the fourth century A.D., the most important books began to be manufactured in parchment, and works worth preserving were transferred from papyrus to parchment. Parchment had significant advantages over papyrus, including higher durability in moist climates and being more conducive to writing on both sides of the surface. The main advantage of papyrus had been its cheaper raw material — the papyrus plant is easy to cultivate in a suitable climate and produces more writing material than animal hides (the most expensive books, made from foetal vellum would take up to dozens of bovine fetuses to produce). However, as trade networks declined, the availability of papyrus outside the range of the papyrus plant became limited and it thus lost its cost advantage. 

Papyrus&#x27; last appearance in the Merovingian chancery was with a document from 692 A.D., though it was known in Gaul until the middle of the following century. The latest certain dates for the use of papyrus in Europe are 1057 for a papal decree (typically conservative, all papal bulls were on papyrus until 1022), under Pope Victor II, and 1087 for an Arabic document. Its use in Egypt continued until it was replaced by less expensive paper introduced by the Islamic world, which originally learned of it from the Chinese. By the 12th century, parchment and paper were in use in the Byzantine Empire, but papyrus was still an option.

Until the middle of the 19th century, only some isolated documents written on papyrus were known, and museums simply showed them as curiosities. They did not contain literary works. The first modern discovery of papyri rolls was made at Herculaneum in 1752. Until then, the only papyri known had been a few surviving from medieval times. Scholarly investigations began with the Dutch historian Caspar Jacob Christiaan Reuvens (1793–1835). He wrote about the content of the Leyden papyrus, published in 1830. The first publication has been credited to the British scholar Charles Wycliffe Goodwin (1817–1878), who published for the Cambridge Antiquarian Society one of the Papyri Graecae Magicae V, translated into English with commentary in 1853.

=== Varying quality ===
Papyrus was made in several qualities and prices. Pliny the Elder and Isidore of Seville described six variations of papyrus that were sold in the Roman market of the day. These were graded by quality based on how fine, firm, white, and smooth the writing surface was. Grades ranged from the superfine Augustan, which was produced in sheets of 13 digits (10 inches) wide, to the least expensive and most coarse, measuring six digits (four inches) wide. Materials deemed unusable for writing or less than six digits were considered commercial quality and were pasted edge to edge to be used only for wrapping.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;papyrus&quot; derives, via Latin, from Greek πάπυρος (&quot;papyros&quot;), a loanword of unknown (perhaps Pre-Greek) origin. Greek has a second word for it, βύβλος (&quot;byblos&quot;), said to derive from the name of the Phoenician city of Byblos. The Greek writer Theophrastus, who flourished during the 4th century BCE, uses &quot;papyros&quot; when referring to the plant used as a foodstuff and &quot;byblos&quot; for the same plant when used for nonfood products, such as cordage, basketry, or writing surfaces. The more specific term βίβλος &quot;biblos&quot;, which finds its way into English in such words as &#x27;bibliography&#x27;, &#x27;bibliophile&#x27;, and &#x27;bible&#x27;, refers to the inner bark of the papyrus plant. &quot;Papyrus&quot; is also the etymon of &#x27;paper&#x27;, a similar substance.

In the Egyptian language, papyrus was called &quot;wadj&quot; (&quot;w3ḏ&quot;), &quot;tjufy&quot; (&quot;ṯwfy&quot;), or &quot;djet&quot; (&quot;ḏt&quot;).

== Documents written on papyrus ==
The word for the material papyrus is also used to designate documents written on sheets of it, often rolled up into scrolls. The plural for such documents is papyri. Historical papyri are given identifying names – generally the name of the discoverer, first owner, or institution where they are kept – and numbered, such as &quot;Papyrus Harris I&quot;. Often an abbreviated form is used, such as &quot;pHarris I&quot;. These documents provide important information on ancient writings; they give us the only extant copy of Menander, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Egyptian treatises on medicine (the Ebers Papyrus) and on surgery (the Edwin Smith papyrus), Egyptian mathematical treatises (the Rhind papyrus), and Egyptian folk tales (the Westcar Papyrus). When, in the 18th century, a library of ancient papyri was found in Herculaneum, ripples of expectation spread among the learned men of the time. However, since these papyri were badly charred, their unscrolling and deciphering are still going on today.

== Manufacture and use ==

Papyrus was made from the stem of the papyrus plant, &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot;. The outer rind was first removed, and the sticky fibrous inner pith is cut lengthwise into thin strips about long. The strips were then placed side by side on a hard surface with their edges slightly overlapping, and then another layer of strips is laid on top at right angles. The strips may have been soaked in water long enough for decomposition to begin, perhaps increasing adhesion, but this is not certain. The two layers possibly were glued together. While still moist, the two layers were hammered together, mashing the layers into a single sheet. The sheet was then dried under pressure. After drying, the sheet was polished with a rounded object, possibly a stone, seashell, or round hardwood.

Sheets, or Mollema, could be cut to fit the obligatory size or glued together to create a longer roll. The point where the Mollema are joined with glue is called the kollesis. A wooden stick would be attached to the last sheet in a roll, making it easier to handle. To form the long strip scrolls required, several such sheets were united and placed so all the horizontal fibres parallel with the roll&#x27;s length were on one side and all the vertical fibres on the other. Normally, texts were first written on the &quot;recto&quot;, the lines following the fibres, parallel to the long edges of the scroll. Secondarily, papyrus was often reused, writing across the fibres on the &quot;verso&quot;.

One source used for determining the method by which papyrus was created in antiquity is through the examination of tombs in the ancient Egyptian city of Thebes, which housed a necropolis containing many murals displaying the process of papyrus-making. The Roman commander Pliny the Elder also describes the methods of preparing papyrus in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;.

In a dry climate, like that of Egypt, papyrus is stable, formed as it is of highly rot-resistant cellulose, but storage in humid conditions can result in molds attacking and destroying the material. Library papyrus rolls were stored in wooden boxes and chests made in the form of statues. Papyrus scrolls were organized according to subject or author and identified with clay labels that specified their contents without having to unroll the scroll. In European conditions, papyrus seems to have lasted only a matter of decades; a 200-year-old papyrus was considered extraordinary. Imported papyrus once commonplace in Greece and Italy has since deteriorated beyond repair, but papyri are still being found in Egypt; extraordinary examples include the Elephantine papyri and the famous finds at Oxyrhynchus and Nag Hammadi. The Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, containing the library of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, Julius Caesar&#x27;s father-in-law, was preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius but has only been partially excavated.

Sporadic attempts to revive the manufacture of papyrus have been made since the mid-18th century. Scottish explorer James Bruce experimented in the late 18th century with papyrus plants from Sudan, for papyrus had become extinct in Egypt. Also in the 18th century, Sicilian Saverio Landolina manufactured papyrus at Syracuse, where papyrus plants had continued to grow in the wild. During the 1920s, when Egyptologist Battiscombe Gunn lived in Maadi, outside Cairo, he experimented with the manufacture of papyrus, growing the plant in his garden. He beat the sliced papyrus stalks between two layers of linen and produced successful examples of papyrus, one of which was exhibited in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The modern technique of papyrus production used in Egypt for the tourist trade was developed in 1962 by the Egyptian engineer Hassan Ragab using plants that had been reintroduced into Egypt in 1872 from France. Both Sicily and Egypt have centres of limited papyrus production.

Papyrus is still used by communities living in the vicinity of swamps, to the extent that rural householders derive up to 75% of their income from swamp goods. Particularly in East and Central Africa, people harvest papyrus, which is used to manufacture items that are sold or used locally. Examples include baskets, hats, fish traps, trays or winnowing mats, and floor mats. Papyrus is also used to make roofs, ceilings, rope, and fences. Although alternatives, such as eucalyptus, are increasingly available, papyrus is still used as fuel.

<text>In digital imaging, a pixel (abbreviated px), pel, or picture element is the smallest addressable element in a raster image, or the smallest addressable element in a dot matrix display device. In most digital display devices, pixels are the smallest element that can be manipulated through software.

Each pixel is a sample of an original image; more samples typically provide more accurate representations of the original. The intensity of each pixel is variable. In color imaging systems, a color is typically represented by three or four component intensities such as red, green, and blue, or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.

In some contexts (such as descriptions of camera sensors), &quot;pixel&quot; refers to a single scalar element of a multi-component representation (called a &quot;photosite&quot; in the camera sensor context, although &quot;&quot; is sometimes used), while in yet other contexts (like MRI) it may refer to a set of component intensities for a spatial position.

Software on early consumer computers was necessarily rendered at a low resolution, with large pixels visible to the naked eye; graphics made under these limitations may be called pixel art, especially in reference to video games. Modern computers and displays, however, can easily render orders of magnitude more pixels than was previously possible, necessitating the use of large measurements like the megapixel (one million pixels).

==Etymology==

The word &quot;pixel&quot; is a combination of &quot;pix&quot; (from &quot;pictures&quot;, shortened to &quot;pics&quot;) and &quot;el&quot; (for &quot;element&quot;); similar formations with &#x27;&quot;el&quot;&#x27; include the words &quot;voxel&quot; , and &quot;texel&quot; . The word &quot;pix&quot; appeared in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine headlines in 1932, as an abbreviation for the word &quot;pictures&quot;, in reference to movies. By 1938, &quot;pix&quot; was being used in reference to still pictures by photojournalists.

The word &quot;pixel&quot; was first published in 1965 by Frederic C. Billingsley of JPL, to describe the picture elements of scanned images from space probes to the Moon and Mars. Billingsley had learned the word from Keith E. McFarland, at the Link Division of General Precision in Palo Alto, who in turn said he did not know where it originated. McFarland said simply it was &quot;in use at the time&quot; ().

The concept of a &quot;picture element&quot; dates to the earliest days of television, for example as &quot;Bildpunkt&quot; (the German word for &quot;pixel&quot;, literally &#x27;picture point&#x27;) in the 1888 German patent of Paul Nipkow. According to various etymologies, the earliest publication of the term &quot;picture element&quot; itself was in &quot;Wireless World&quot; magazine in 1927, though it had been used earlier in various U.S. patents filed as early as 1911.

Some authors explain &quot;pixel&quot; as &quot;picture cell,&quot; as early as 1972. In graphics and in image and video processing, &quot;pel&quot; is often used instead of &quot;pixel&quot;. For example, IBM used it in their Technical Reference for the original PC.

Pixilation, spelled with a second &quot;i&quot;, is an unrelated filmmaking technique that dates to the beginnings of cinema, in which live actors are posed frame by frame and photographed to create stop-motion animation. An archaic British word meaning &quot;possession by spirits (pixies)&quot;, the term has been used to describe the animation process since the early 1950s; various animators, including Norman McLaren and Grant Munro, are credited with popularizing it.

==Technical==
 thought of as the smallest single component of a digital image. However, the definition is highly context-sensitive. For example, there can be &quot;printed pixels&quot; in a page, or pixels carried by electronic signals, or represented by digital values, or pixels on a display device, or pixels in a digital camera (photosensor elements). This list is not exhaustive and, depending on context, synonyms include pel, sample, byte, bit, dot, and spot. &quot;Pixels&quot; can be used as a unit of measure such as: 2400 pixels per inch, 640 pixels per line, or spaced 10 pixels apart.

The measures &quot;dots per inch&quot; (dpi) and &quot;pixels per inch&quot; (ppi) are sometimes used interchangeably, but have distinct meanings, especially for printer devices, where dpi is a measure of the printer&#x27;s density of dot (e.g. ink droplet) placement. For example, a high-quality photographic image may be printed with 600 ppi on a 1200 dpi inkjet printer. Even higher dpi numbers, such as the 4800 dpi quoted by printer manufacturers since 2002, do not mean much in terms of achievable resolution.

The more pixels used to represent an image, the closer the result can resemble the original. The number of pixels in an image is sometimes called the resolution, though resolution has a more specific definition. Pixel counts can be expressed as a single number, as in a &quot;three-megapixel&quot; digital camera, which has a nominal three million pixels, or as a pair of numbers, as in a &quot;640 by 480 display&quot;, which has 640 pixels from side to side and 480 from top to bottom (as in a VGA display) and therefore has a total number of 640 × 480 = 307,200 pixels, or 0.3 megapixels.

The pixels, or color samples, that form a digitized image (such as a JPEG file used on a web page) may or may not be in one-to-one correspondence with screen pixels, depending on how a computer displays an image. In computing, an image composed of pixels is known as a &quot;bitmapped image&quot; or a &quot;raster image&quot;. The word &quot;raster&quot; originates from television scanning patterns, and has been widely used to describe similar halftone printing and storage techniques.

===Sampling patterns===
For convenience, pixels are normally arranged in a regular two-dimensional grid. By using this arrangement, many common operations can be implemented by uniformly applying the same operation to each pixel independently. Other arrangements of pixels are possible, with some sampling patterns even changing the shape (or kernel) of each pixel across the image. For this reason, care must be taken when acquiring an image on one device and displaying it on another, or when converting image data from one pixel format to another.

For example:

* LCD screens typically use a staggered grid, where the red, green, and blue components are sampled at slightly different locations. Subpixel rendering is a technology which takes advantage of these differences to improve the rendering of text on LCD screens.
* The vast majority of color digital cameras use a Bayer filter, resulting in a regular grid of pixels where the &quot;color&quot; of each pixel depends on its position on the grid.
* A clipmap uses a hierarchical sampling pattern, where the size of the support of each pixel depends on its location within the hierarchy.
* Warped grids are used when the underlying geometry is non-planar, such as images of the earth from space.
* The use of non-uniform grids is an active research area, attempting to bypass the traditional Nyquist limit.
* Pixels on computer monitors are normally &quot;square&quot; (that is, have equal horizontal and vertical sampling pitch); pixels in other systems are often &quot;rectangular&quot; (that is, have unequal horizontal and vertical sampling pitch – oblong in shape), as are digital video formats with diverse aspect ratios, such as the anamorphic widescreen formats of the Rec. 601 digital video standard.

===Resolution of computer monitors===
Computer monitors (and TV sets) generally have a fixed native resolution. What it is depends on the monitor, and size. See below for historical exceptions.

Computers can use pixels to display an image, often an abstract image that represents a GUI. The resolution of this image is called the display resolution and is determined by the video card of the computer. Flat-panel monitors (and TV sets), e.g. OLED or LCD monitors, or E-ink, also use pixels to display an image, and have a native resolution, and it should (ideally) be matched to the video card resolution. Each pixel is made up of triads, with the number of these triads determining the native resolution.

On older, historically available, CRT monitors the resolution was possibly adjustable (still lower than what modern monitor achieve), while on some such monitors (or TV sets) the beam sweep rate was fixed, resulting in a fixed native resolution. Most CRT monitors do not have a fixed beam sweep rate, meaning they do not have a native resolution at all – instead they have a set of resolutions that are equally well supported. To produce the sharpest images possible on a flat-panel, e.g. OLED or LCD, the user must ensure the display resolution of the computer matches the native resolution of the monitor.

===Resolution of telescopes===
The pixel scale used in astronomy is the angular distance between two objects on the sky that fall one pixel apart on the detector (CCD or infrared chip). The scale measured in radians is the ratio of the pixel spacing and focal length of the preceding optics, . (The focal length is the product of the focal ratio by the diameter of the associated lens or mirror.)

Because is usually expressed in units of arcseconds per pixel, because 1 radian equals (180/π) × 3600 ≈ 206,265 arcseconds, and because focal lengths are often given in millimeters and pixel sizes in micrometers which yields another factor of 1,000, the formula is often quoted as .

===Bits per pixel===
The number of distinct colors that can be represented by a pixel depends on the number of bits per pixel (bpp). A 1 bpp image uses 1 bit for each pixel, so each pixel can be either on or off. Each additional bit doubles the number of colors available, so a 2 bpp image can have 4 colors, and a 3 bpp image can have 8 colors:
* 1 bpp, 21 = 2 colors (monochrome)
* 2 bpp, 22 = 4 colors
* 3 bpp, 23 = 8 colors
* 4 bpp, 24 = 16 colors
* 8 bpp, 28 = 256 colors
* 16 bpp, 216 = 65,536 colors (&quot;Highcolor&quot; )
* 24 bpp, 224 = 16,777,216 colors (&quot;Truecolor&quot;)

For color depths of 15 or more bits per pixel, the depth is normally the sum of the bits allocated to each of the red, green, and blue components. Highcolor, usually meaning 16 bpp, normally has five bits for red and blue each, and six bits for green, as the human eye is more sensitive to errors in green than in the other two primary colors. For applications involving transparency, the 16 bits may be divided into five bits each of red, green, and blue, with one bit left for transparency. A 24-bit depth allows 8 bits per component. On some systems, 32-bit depth is available: this means that each 24-bit pixel has an extra 8 bits to describe its opacity (for purposes of combining with another image).

===Subpixels===
Many display and image-acquisition systems are not capable of displaying or sensing the different color channels at the same site. Therefore, the pixel grid is divided into single-color regions that contribute to the displayed or sensed color when viewed at a distance. In some displays, such as LCD, LED, and plasma displays, these single-color regions are separately addressable elements, which have come to be known as subpixels, mostly RGB colors. For example, LCDs typically divide each pixel vertically into three subpixels. When the square pixel is divided into three subpixels, each subpixel is necessarily rectangular. In display industry terminology, subpixels are often referred to as &quot;pixels&quot;, as they are the basic addressable elements in a viewpoint of hardware, and hence &quot;pixel circuits&quot; rather than &quot;subpixel circuits&quot; is used.

Most digital camera image sensors use single-color sensor regions, for example using the Bayer filter pattern, and in the camera industry these are known as &quot;pixels&quot; just like in the display industry, not &quot;subpixels&quot;.

For systems with subpixels, two different approaches can be taken:
* The subpixels can be ignored, with full-color pixels being treated as the smallest addressable imaging element; or
* The subpixels can be included in rendering calculations, which requires more analysis and processing time, but can produce apparently superior images in some cases.

This latter approach, referred to as subpixel rendering, uses knowledge of pixel geometry to manipulate the three colored subpixels separately, producing an increase in the apparent resolution of color displays. While CRT displays use red-green-blue-masked phosphor areas, dictated by a mesh grid called the shadow mask, it would require a difficult calibration step to be aligned with the displayed pixel raster, and so CRTs do not use subpixel rendering.

The concept of subpixels is related to samples.

===Logical pixel===
In graphic, web design, and user interfaces, a &quot;pixel&quot; may refer to a fixed length rather than a true pixel on the screen to accommodate different pixel densities. A typical definition, such as in CSS, is that a &quot;physical&quot; pixel is . Doing so makes sure a given element will display as the same size no matter what screen resolution views it.

There may, however, be some further adjustments between a &quot;physical&quot; pixel and an on-screen logical pixel. As screens are viewed at difference distances (consider a phone, a computer display, and a TV), the desired length (a &quot;reference pixel&quot;) is scaled relative to a reference viewing distance ( in CSS). In addition, as true screen pixel densities are rarely multiples of 96 dpi, some rounding is often applied so that a logical pixel is an integer amount of actual pixels. Doing so avoids render artifacts. The final &quot;pixel&quot; obtained after these two steps becomes the &quot;anchor&quot; to which all other absolute measurements (e.g. the &quot;centimeter&quot;) are based on.

Worked example, with a 2160p TV placed away from the viewer:
* Calculate the scaled pixel size as .
* Calculate the DPI of the TV as .
* Calculate the real-pixel count per logical-pixel as .
A browser will then choose to use the 1.721× pixel size, or round to a 2× ratio.

==Megapixel==
A megapixel (MP) is a million pixels; the term is used not only for the number of pixels in an image but also to express the number of image sensor elements of digital cameras or the number of display elements of digital displays. For example, a camera that makes a 2048 × 1536 pixel image (3,145,728 finished image pixels) typically uses a few extra rows and columns of sensor elements and is commonly said to have &quot;3.2 megapixels&quot; or &quot;3.4 megapixels&quot;, depending on whether the number reported is the &quot;effective&quot; or the &quot;total&quot; pixel count.

The number of pixels is sometimes quoted as the &quot;resolution&quot; of a photo. This measure of resolution can be calculated by multiplying the width and height of a sensor in pixels.

Digital cameras use photosensitive electronics, either charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, consisting of a large number of single sensor elements, each of which records a measured intensity level. In most digital cameras, the sensor array is covered with a patterned color filter mosaic having red, green, and blue regions in the Bayer filter arrangement so that each sensor element can record the intensity of a single primary color of light. The camera interpolates the color information of neighboring sensor elements, through a process called demosaicing, to create the final image. These sensor elements are often called &quot;pixels&quot;, even though they only record one channel (only red or green or blue) of the final color image. Thus, two of the three color channels for each sensor must be interpolated and a so-called &quot;N-megapixel&quot; camera that produces an N-megapixel image provides only one-third of the information that an image of the same size could get from a scanner. Thus, certain color contrasts may look fuzzier than others, depending on the allocation of the primary colors (green has twice as many elements as red or blue in the Bayer arrangement).

DxO Labs invented the Perceptual MegaPixel (P-MPix) to measure the sharpness that a camera produces when paired to a particular lens – as opposed to the MP a manufacturer states for a camera product, which is based only on the camera&#x27;s sensor. The new P-MPix claims to be a more accurate and relevant value for photographers to consider when weighing up camera sharpness. As of mid-2013, the Sigma 35 mm f/1.4 DG HSM lens mounted on a Nikon D800 has the highest measured P-MPix. However, with a value of 23 MP, it still more than one-third of the D800&#x27;s 36.3 MP sensor. In August 2019, Xiaomi released the Redmi Note 8 Pro as the world&#x27;s first smartphone with 64 MP camera. On December 12, 2019, Samsung released Samsung A71 that also has a 64 MP camera. In late 2019, Xiaomi announced the first camera phone with 108 MP 1/1.33-inch across sensor. The sensor is larger than most of bridge camera with 1/2.3-inch across sensor.

One new method to add megapixels has been introduced in a Micro Four Thirds System camera, which only uses a 16 MP sensor but can produce a 64 MP RAW (40 MP JPEG) image by making two exposures, shifting the sensor by a half pixel between them. Using a tripod to take level multi-shots within an instance, the multiple 16 MP images are then generated into a unified 64 MP image.

<text>A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, or , involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.

The property of being prime is called primality. A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number , called trial division, tests whether is a multiple of any integer between 2 and . Faster algorithms include the Miller–Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small chance of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers. the largest known prime number is a Mersenne prime with 41,024,320 decimal digits.

There are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. No known simple formula separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes within the natural numbers in the large can be statistically modelled. The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says roughly that the probability of a randomly chosen large number being prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, that is, to its logarithm.

Several historical questions regarding prime numbers are still unsolved. These include Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and the twin prime conjecture, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by two. Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. In abstract algebra, objects that behave in a generalized way like prime numbers include prime elements and prime ideals.

== Definition and examples ==

A natural number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a &quot;prime number&quot; (or a &quot;prime&quot;) if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers. The numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite numbers. In other words, is prime if items cannot be divided up into smaller equal-size groups of more than one item, or if it is not possible to arrange dots into a rectangular grid that is more than one dot wide and more than one dot high. For example, among the numbers 1 through 6, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are the prime numbers, as there are no other numbers that divide them evenly (without a remainder). 1 is not prime, as it is specifically excluded in the definition. and are both composite.
The divisors of a natural number are the natural numbers that divide evenly. Every natural number has both 1 and itself as a divisor. If it has any other divisor, it cannot be prime. This leads to an equivalent definition of prime numbers: they are the numbers with exactly two positive divisors. Those two are 1 and the number itself. As 1 has only one divisor, itself, it is not prime by this definition. Yet another way to express the same thing is that a number is prime if it is greater than one and if none of the numbers formula_1 divides evenly.

The first 25 prime numbers (all the prime numbers less than 100) are:
: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 .

No even number greater than 2 is prime because any such number can be expressed as the product . Therefore, every prime number other than 2 is an odd number, and is called an &quot;odd prime&quot;. Similarly, when written in the usual decimal system, all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9. The numbers that end with other digits are all composite: decimal numbers that end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are even, and decimal numbers that end in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5.

The set of all primes is sometimes denoted by formula_2 (a boldface capital P) or by formula_3 (a blackboard bold capital P).

== History ==
The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, from around 1550 BC, has Egyptian fraction expansions of different forms for prime and composite numbers. However, the earliest surviving records of the study of prime numbers come from the ancient Greek mathematicians, who called them (). Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; (c. 300 BC) proves the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and shows how to construct a perfect number from a Mersenne prime. Another Greek invention, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, is still used to construct lists of 

Around 1000 AD, the Islamic mathematician Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) found Wilson&#x27;s theorem, characterizing the prime numbers as the numbers that evenly divide . He also conjectured that all even perfect numbers come from Euclid&#x27;s construction using Mersenne primes, but was unable to prove it. Another Islamic mathematician, Ibn al-Banna&#x27; al-Marrakushi, observed that the sieve of Eratosthenes can be sped up by considering only the prime divisors up to the square root of the upper limit. Fibonacci took the innovations from Islamic mathematics to Europe. His book &quot;Liber Abaci&quot; (1202) was the first to describe trial division for testing primality, again using divisors only up to the square root.

In 1640 Pierre de Fermat stated (without proof) Fermat&#x27;s little theorem (later proved by Leibniz and Euler). Fermat also investigated the primality of the Fermat numbers , and Marin Mersenne studied the Mersenne primes, prime numbers of the form formula_4 with itself a prime. Christian Goldbach formulated Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, that every even number is the sum of two primes, in a 1742 letter to Euler. Euler proved Alhazen&#x27;s conjecture (now the Euclid–Euler theorem) that all even perfect numbers can be constructed from Mersenne primes. He introduced methods from mathematical analysis to this area in his proofs of the infinitude of the primes and the divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes . At the start of the 19th century, Legendre and Gauss conjectured that as tends to infinity, the number of primes up to is asymptotic to , where formula_5 is the natural logarithm of . A weaker consequence of this high density of primes was Bertrand&#x27;s postulate, that for every formula_6 there is a prime between and , proved in 1852 by Pafnuty Chebyshev. Ideas of Bernhard Riemann in his 1859 paper on the zeta-function sketched an outline for proving the conjecture of Legendre and Gauss. Although the closely related Riemann hypothesis remains unproven, Riemann&#x27;s outline was completed in 1896 by Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin, and the result is now known as the prime number theorem. Another important 19th century result was Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions, that certain arithmetic progressions contain infinitely many primes.

Many mathematicians have worked on primality tests for numbers larger than those where trial division is practicably applicable. Methods that are restricted to specific number forms include Pépin&#x27;s test for Fermat numbers (1877), Proth&#x27;s theorem (c. 1878), the Lucas–Lehmer primality test (originated 1856), and the generalized Lucas primality test.

Since 1951 all the largest known primes have been found using these tests on computers. The search for ever larger primes has generated interest outside mathematical circles, through the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search and other distributed computing projects. The idea that prime numbers had few applications outside of pure mathematics was shattered in the 1970s when public-key cryptography and the RSA cryptosystem were invented, using prime numbers as their basis.

The increased practical importance of computerized primality testing and factorization led to the development of improved methods capable of handling large numbers of unrestricted form. The mathematical theory of prime numbers also moved forward with the Green–Tao theorem (2004) that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers, and Yitang Zhang&#x27;s 2013 proof that there exist infinitely many prime gaps of bounded size.

=== Primality of one ===
Most early Greeks did not even consider to be a number, so they could not consider its primality. A few scholars in the Greek and later Roman tradition, including Nicomachus, Iamblichus, Boethius, and Cassiodorus, also considered the prime numbers to be a subdivision of the odd numbers, so they did not consider to be prime either. However, Euclid and a majority of the other Greek mathematicians considered as prime. The medieval Islamic mathematicians largely followed the Greeks in viewing as not being a number. By the Middle Ages and Renaissance, mathematicians began treating as a number, and by the 17th century some of them included it as the first prime number. In the mid-18th century, Christian Goldbach listed as prime in his correspondence with Leonhard Euler; however, Euler himself did not consider 1 to be prime. Many 19th century mathematicians still considered to be prime, and Derrick Norman Lehmer included in his &quot;list of primes less than ten million&quot; published in 1914. Lists of primes that included 1 continued to be published as recently However, around this time, by the early 20th century, mathematicians started to agree that 1 should not be classified as a prime number.

If were to be considered a prime, many statements involving primes would need to be awkwardly reworded. For example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic would need to be rephrased in terms of factorizations into primes greater than , because every number would have multiple factorizations with any number of copies of . Similarly, the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly if it handled as a prime, because it would eliminate all multiples of (that is, all other numbers) and output only the single number . Some other more technical properties of prime numbers also do not hold for the number : for instance, the formulas for Euler&#x27;s totient function or for the sum of divisors function are different for prime numbers than they are for . By the early 20th century, mathematicians began to agree that 1 should not be listed as prime, but rather in its own special category as a &quot;unit&quot;.

Writing a number as a product of prime numbers is called a &quot;prime factorization&quot; of the number. For example:
: formula_7
The terms in the product are called &quot;prime factors&quot;. The same prime factor may occur more than once; this example has two copies of the prime factor formula_8 When a prime occurs multiple times, exponentiation can be used to group together multiple copies of the same prime number: for example, in the second way of writing the product above, formula_9 denotes the square or second power of .

The central importance of prime numbers to number theory and mathematics in general stems from the &quot;fundamental theorem of arithmetic&quot;. This theorem states that every integer larger than can be written as a product of one or more primes. More strongly, this product is unique in the sense that any two prime factorizations of the same number will have the same numbers of copies of the same primes, although their ordering may differ. So, although there are many different ways of finding a factorization using an integer factorization algorithm, they all must produce the same result. Primes can thus be considered the &quot;basic building blocks&quot; of the natural numbers.

Some proofs of the uniqueness of prime factorizations are based on Euclid&#x27;s lemma: If is a prime number and divides a product formula_10 of integers and formula_11 then divides or divides (or both). Conversely, if a number has the property that when it divides a product it always divides at least one factor of the product, then must be prime.

=== Infinitude ===

There are infinitely many prime numbers. Another way of saying this is that the sequence
: formula_12
of prime numbers never ends. This statement is referred to as &quot;Euclid&#x27;s theorem&quot; in honor of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, since the first known proof for this statement is attributed to him. Many more proofs of the infinitude of primes are known, including an analytical proof by Euler, Goldbach&#x27;s proof based on Fermat numbers, Furstenberg&#x27;s proof using general topology, and Kummer&#x27;s elegant proof.

Euclid&#x27;s proof shows that every finite list of primes is incomplete. The key idea is to multiply together the primes in any given list and add formula_13 If the list consists of the primes formula_14 this gives the number
: formula_15

By the fundamental theorem, has a prime factorization
: formula_16
with one or more prime factors. is evenly divisible by each of these factors, but has a remainder of one when divided by any of the prime numbers in the given list, so none of the prime factors of can be in the given list. Because there is no finite list of all the primes, there must be infinitely many primes.

The numbers formed by adding one to the products of the smallest primes are called Euclid numbers. The first five of them are prime, but the sixth,
: formula_17
is a composite number.

=== Formulas for primes ===
There is no known efficient formula for primes. For example, there is no non-constant polynomial, even in several variables, that takes &quot;only&quot; prime values. However, there are numerous expressions that do encode all primes, or only primes. One possible formula is based on Wilson&#x27;s theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once. There is also a set of Diophantine equations in nine variables and one parameter with the following property: the parameter is prime if and only if the resulting system of equations has a solution over the natural numbers. This can be used to obtain a single formula with the property that all its &quot;positive&quot; values are prime.

Other examples of prime-generating formulas come from Mills&#x27; theorem and a theorem of Wright. These assert that there are real constants formula_18 and formula_19 such that
: formula_20
are prime for any natural number in the first formula, and any number of exponents in the second formula. Here formula_21 represents the floor function, the largest integer less than or equal to the number in question. However, these are not useful for generating primes, as the primes must be generated first in order to compute the values of or formula_22

=== Open questions ===
Many conjectures revolving about primes have been posed. Often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood proof for decades: all four of Landau&#x27;s problems from 1912 are still unsolved. One of them is Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, which asserts that every even integer greater than can be written as a sum of two primes. , this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to formula_23 Weaker statements than this have been proven; for example, Vinogradov&#x27;s theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen&#x27;s theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime (the product of two primes). Also, any even integer greater than can be written as the sum of six primes. The branch of number theory studying such questions is called additive number theory.

Another type of problem concerns prime gaps, the differences between consecutive primes.
The existence of arbitrarily large prime gaps can be seen by noting that the sequence formula_24 consists of formula_25 composite numbers, for any natural number formula_26 However, large prime gaps occur much earlier than this argument shows. For example, the first prime gap of length 8 is between the primes 89 and 97, much smaller than formula_27 It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2; this is the twin prime conjecture. Polignac&#x27;s conjecture states more generally that for every positive integer formula_28 there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by formula_29
Andrica&#x27;s conjecture, Brocard&#x27;s conjecture, Legendre&#x27;s conjecture, and Oppermann&#x27;s conjecture all suggest that the largest gaps between primes from to should be at most approximately formula_30 a result that is known to follow from the Riemann hypothesis, while the much stronger Cramér conjecture sets the largest gap size at . Prime gaps can be generalized to prime -tuples, patterns in the differences among more than two prime numbers. Their infinitude and density are the subject of the first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture, which can be motivated by the heuristic that the prime numbers behave similarly to a random sequence of numbers with density given by the prime number theorem.

== Analytic properties ==
Analytic number theory studies number theory through the lens of continuous functions, limits, infinite series, and the related mathematics of the infinite and infinitesimal.

This area of study began with Leonhard Euler and his first major result, the solution to the Basel problem.
The problem asked for the value of the infinite sum formula_31
which today can be recognized as the value formula_32 of the Riemann zeta function. This function is closely connected to the prime numbers and to one of the most significant unsolved problems in mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis. Euler showed that .
The reciprocal of this number, , is the limiting probability that two random numbers selected uniformly from a large range are relatively prime (have no factors in common).

The distribution of primes in the large, such as the question how many primes are smaller than a given, large threshold, is described by the prime number theorem, but no efficient formula for the -th prime is known. Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions, in its basic form, asserts that linear polynomials
: formula_33
with relatively prime integers and take infinitely many prime values. Stronger forms of the theorem state that the sum of the reciprocals of these prime values diverges, and that different linear polynomials with the same have approximately the same proportions of primes.
Although conjectures have been formulated about the proportions of primes in higher-degree polynomials, they remain unproven, and it is unknown whether there exists a quadratic polynomial that (for integer arguments) is prime infinitely often.

=== Analytical proof of Euclid&#x27;s theorem ===
Euler&#x27;s proof that there are infinitely many primes considers the sums of reciprocals of primes,
: formula_34

Euler showed that, for any arbitrary real number , there exists a prime for which this sum is bigger than . This shows that there are infinitely many primes, because if there were finitely many primes the sum would reach its maximum value at the biggest prime rather than growing past every .
The growth rate of this sum is described more precisely by Mertens&#x27; second theorem. For comparison, the sum
: formula_35
does not grow to infinity as goes to infinity (see the Basel problem). In this sense, prime numbers occur more often than squares of natural numbers,
although both sets are infinite. Brun&#x27;s theorem states that the sum of the reciprocals of twin primes,
: formula_36
is finite. Because of Brun&#x27;s theorem, it is not possible to use Euler&#x27;s method to solve the twin prime conjecture, that there exist infinitely many twin primes.

=== Number of primes below a given bound ===
The prime-counting function formula_37 is defined as the number of primes not greater than . For example, , since there are five primes less than or equal to . Methods such as the Meissel–Lehmer algorithm can compute exact values of formula_37 faster than it would be possible to list each prime up to . The prime number theorem states that formula_37 is asymptotic to , which is denoted as
: formula_40
and means that the ratio of formula_37 to the right-hand fraction approaches 1 as grows to infinity. This implies that the likelihood that a randomly chosen number less than is prime is (approximately) inversely proportional to the number of digits in .
It also implies that the th prime number is proportional to formula_42
and therefore that the average size of a prime gap is proportional to .
A more accurate estimate for formula_37 is given by the offset logarithmic integral
: formula_44

=== Arithmetic progressions ===

An arithmetic progression is a finite or infinite sequence of numbers such that consecutive numbers in the sequence all have the same difference. This difference is called the modulus of the progression. For example,
: formula_45
is an infinite arithmetic progression with modulus 9. In an arithmetic progression, all the numbers have the same remainder when divided by the modulus; in this example, the remainder is 3. Because both the modulus 9 and the remainder 3 are multiples of 3, so is every element in the sequence. Therefore, this progression contains only one prime number, 3 itself. In general, the infinite progression
: formula_46
can have more than one prime only when its remainder and modulus are relatively prime. If they are relatively prime, Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes.

The Green–Tao theorem shows that there are arbitrarily long finite arithmetic progressions consisting only of primes.

=== Prime values of quadratic polynomials ===

Euler noted that the function
: formula_47
yields prime numbers for , although composite numbers appear among its later values. The search for an explanation for this phenomenon led to the deep algebraic number theory of Heegner numbers and the class number problem. The Hardy–Littlewood conjecture F predicts the density of primes among the values of quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients in terms of the logarithmic integral and the polynomial coefficients. No quadratic polynomial has been proven to take infinitely many prime values.

The Ulam spiral arranges the natural numbers in a two-dimensional grid, spiraling in concentric squares surrounding the origin with the prime numbers highlighted. Visually, the primes appear to cluster on certain diagonals and not others, suggesting that some quadratic polynomials take prime values more often than others.

=== Zeta function and the Riemann hypothesis ===
One of the most famous unsolved questions in mathematics, dating from 1859, and one of the Millennium Prize Problems, is the Riemann hypothesis, which asks where the zeros of the Riemann zeta function formula_48 are located.
This function is an analytic function on the complex numbers. For complex numbers with real part greater than one it equals both an infinite sum over all integers, and an infinite product over the prime numbers,
: formula_49
This equality between a sum and a product, discovered by Euler, is called an Euler product. The Euler product can be derived from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and shows the close connection between the zeta function and the prime numbers.
It leads to another proof that there are infinitely many primes: if there were only finitely many,
then the sum-product equality would also be valid at , but the sum would diverge (it is the harmonic series ) while the product would be finite, a contradiction.

The Riemann hypothesis states that the zeros of the zeta-function are all either negative even numbers, or complex numbers with real part equal to 1/2. The original proof of the prime number theorem was based on a weak form of this hypothesis, that there are no zeros with real part equal to , although other more elementary proofs have been found. The prime-counting function can be expressed by Riemann&#x27;s explicit formula as a sum in which each term comes from one of the zeros of the zeta function; the main term of this sum is the logarithmic integral, and the remaining terms cause the sum to fluctuate above and below the main term. In this sense, the zeros control how regularly the prime numbers are distributed. If the Riemann hypothesis is true, these fluctuations will be small, and the
asymptotic distribution of primes given by the prime number theorem will also hold over much shorter intervals (of length about the square root of for intervals near a number ).

== Abstract algebra ==

=== Modular arithmetic and finite fields ===

Modular arithmetic modifies usual arithmetic by only using the numbers , for a natural number called the modulus.
Any other natural number can be mapped into this system by replacing it by its remainder after division by . Modular sums, differences and products are calculated by performing the same replacement by the remainder on the result of the usual sum, difference, or product of integers. Equality of integers corresponds to &quot;congruence&quot; in modular arithmetic: and are congruent (written formula_50 mod ) when they have the same remainder after division by . However, in this system of numbers, division by all nonzero numbers is possible if and only if the modulus is prime. For instance, with the prime number as modulus, division by is possible: , because clearing denominators by multiplying both sides by gives the valid formula . However, with the composite modulus , division by is impossible. There is no valid solution to formula_51: clearing denominators by multiplying by causes the left-hand side to become while the right-hand side becomes either or . In the terminology of abstract algebra, the ability to perform division means that modular arithmetic modulo a prime number forms a field or, more specifically, a finite field, while other moduli only give a ring but not a field.

Several theorems about primes can be formulated using modular arithmetic. For instance, Fermat&#x27;s little theorem states that if formula_52 (mod ), then formula_53 (mod ). Summing this over all choices of gives the equation
:formula_54
valid whenever is prime.
Giuga&#x27;s conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for to be prime. Wilson&#x27;s theorem says that an integer formula_55 is prime if and only if the factorial formula_56 is congruent to formula_57 mod . For a composite number  this cannot hold, since one of its factors divides both and , and so formula_58 is impossible.

=== &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers ===

The -adic order formula_59 of an integer is the number of copies of in the prime factorization of . The same concept can be extended from integers to rational numbers by defining the -adic order of a fraction formula_60 to be . The -adic absolute value formula_61 of any rational number is then defined as . Multiplying an integer by its -adic absolute value cancels out the factors of in its factorization, leaving only the other primes. Just as the distance between two real numbers can be measured by the absolute value of their distance, the distance between two rational numbers can be measured by their -adic distance, the -adic absolute value of their difference. For this definition of distance, two numbers are close together (they have a small distance) when their difference is divisible by a high power of . In the same way that the real numbers can be formed from the rational numbers and their distances, by adding extra limiting values to form a complete field, the rational numbers with the -adic distance can be extended to a different complete field, the -adic numbers.

This picture of an order, absolute value, and complete field derived from them can be generalized to algebraic number fields and their valuations (certain mappings from the multiplicative group of the field to a totally ordered additive group, also called orders), absolute values (certain multiplicative mappings from the field to the real numbers, also called norms), and places (extensions to complete fields in which the given field is a dense set, also called completions). The extension from the rational numbers to the real numbers, for instance, is a place in which the distance between numbers is the usual absolute value of their difference. The corresponding mapping to an additive group would be the logarithm of the absolute value, although this does not meet all the requirements of a valuation. According to Ostrowski&#x27;s theorem, up to a natural notion of equivalence, the real numbers and -adic numbers, with their orders and absolute values, are the only valuations, absolute values, and places on the rational numbers. The local–global principle allows certain problems over the rational numbers to be solved by piecing together solutions from each of their places, again underlining the importance of primes to number theory.

=== Prime elements of a ring ===
A commutative ring is an algebraic structure where addition, subtraction and multiplication are defined. The integers are a ring, and the prime numbers in the integers have been generalized to rings in two different ways, &quot;prime elements&quot; and &quot;irreducible elements&quot;. An element of a ring is called prime if it is nonzero, has no multiplicative inverse (that is, it is not a unit), and satisfies the following requirement: whenever divides the product formula_62 of two elements of , it also divides at least one of or . An element is irreducible if it is neither a unit nor the product of two other non-unit elements. In the ring of integers, the prime and irreducible elements form the same set,
: formula_63
In an arbitrary ring, all prime elements are irreducible. The converse does not hold in general, but does hold for unique factorization domains.

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold (by definition) in unique factorization domains. An example of such a domain is the Gaussian integers , the ring of complex numbers of the form formula_64 where denotes the imaginary unit and and are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes. Not every number that is prime among the integers remains prime in the Gaussian integers; for instance, the number 2 can be written as a product of the two Gaussian primes formula_65 and . Rational primes (the prime elements in the integers) congruent to 3 mod 4 are Gaussian primes, but rational primes congruent to 1 mod 4 are not. This is a consequence of Fermat&#x27;s theorem on sums of two squares,
which states that an odd prime is expressible as the sum of two squares, , and therefore factorable as , exactly when is 1 mod 4.

=== Prime ideals ===

Not every ring is a unique factorization domain. For instance, in the ring of numbers formula_66 (for integers and ) the number formula_67 has two factorizations , where neither of the four factors can be reduced any further, so it does not have a unique factorization. In order to extend unique factorization to a larger class of rings, the notion of a number can be replaced with that of an ideal, a subset of the elements of a ring that contains all sums of pairs of its elements, and all products of its elements with ring elements.
&quot;Prime ideals&quot;, which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. The prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals , , , , , , ... The fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the Lasker–Noether theorem, which expresses every ideal in a Noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals, which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers.

The spectrum of a ring is a geometric space whose points are the prime ideals of the ring. Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry. These concepts can even assist with in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers. For example, prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity, a statement that concerns the existence of square roots modulo integer prime numbers. Early attempts to prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem led to Kummer&#x27;s introduction of regular primes, integer prime numbers connected with the failure of unique factorization in the cyclotomic integers. The question of how many integer prime numbers factor into a product of multiple prime ideals in an algebraic number field is addressed by Chebotarev&#x27;s density theorem, which (when applied to the cyclotomic integers) has Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions as a special case.

=== Group theory ===
In the theory of finite groups the Sylow theorems imply that, if a power of a prime number formula_68 divides the order of a group, then the group has a subgroup of order . By Lagrange&#x27;s theorem, any group of prime order is a cyclic group,
and by Burnside&#x27;s theorem any group whose order is divisible by only two primes is solvable.

== Computational methods ==

For a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of mathematics other than the use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly. In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance.

This vision of the purity of number theory was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public-key cryptography algorithms.
These applications have led to significant study of algorithms for computing with prime numbers, and in particular of primality testing, methods for determining whether a given number is prime. The most basic primality testing routine, trial division, is too slow to be useful for large numbers. One group of modern primality tests is applicable to arbitrary numbers, while more efficient tests are available for numbers of special types. Most primality tests only tell whether their argument is prime or not. Routines that also provide a prime factor of composite arguments (or all of its prime factors) are called factorization algorithms. Prime numbers are also used in computing for checksums, hash tables, and pseudorandom number generators.

=== Trial division ===

The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer is called &quot;trial division&quot;. This method divides by each integer from up to the square root of . Any such integer dividing evenly establishes as composite; otherwise it is prime. Integers larger than the square root do not need to be checked because, whenever , one of the two factors and is less than or equal to the square root of . Another optimization is to check only primes as factors in this range. For instance, to check whether is prime, this method divides it by the primes in the range from to , which are , , and . Each division produces a nonzero remainder, so is indeed prime.

Although this method is simple to describe, it is impractical for testing the primality of large integers, because the number of tests that it performs grows exponentially as a function of the number of digits of these integers. However, trial division is still used, with a smaller limit than the square root on the divisor size, to quickly discover composite numbers with small factors, before using more complicated methods on the numbers that pass this filter.

=== Sieves ===

Before computers, mathematical tables listing all of the primes or prime factorizations up to a given limit were commonly printed. The oldest known method for generating a list of primes is called the sieve of Eratosthenes. The animation shows an optimized variant of this method. Another more asymptotically efficient sieving method for the same problem is the sieve of Atkin. In advanced mathematics, sieve theory applies similar methods to other problems.

=== Primality testing versus primality proving ===
Some of the fastest modern tests for whether an arbitrary given number is prime are probabilistic (or Monte Carlo) algorithms, meaning that they have a small random chance of producing an incorrect answer. For instance the Solovay–Strassen primality test on a given number chooses a number randomly from through formula_69 and uses modular exponentiation to check whether formula_70 is divisible by . If so, it answers yes and otherwise it answers no. If really is prime, it will always answer yes, but if is composite then it answers yes with probability at most 1/2 and no with probability at least 1/2. If this test is repeated times on the same number, the probability that a composite number could pass the test every time is at most . Because this decreases exponentially with the number of tests, it provides high confidence (although not certainty) that a number that passes the repeated test is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then the number is certainly composite.
A composite number that passes such a test is called a pseudoprime.

In contrast, some other algorithms guarantee that their answer will always be correct: primes will always be determined to be prime and composites will always be determined to be composite. For instance, this is true of trial division. The algorithms with guaranteed-correct output include both deterministic (non-random) algorithms, such as the AKS primality test,
and randomized Las Vegas algorithms where the random choices made by the algorithm do not affect its final answer, such as some variations of elliptic curve primality proving.
When the elliptic curve method concludes that a number is prime, it provides primality certificate that can be verified quickly.
The elliptic curve primality test is the fastest in practice of the guaranteed-correct primality tests, but its runtime analysis is based on heuristic arguments rather than rigorous proofs. The AKS primality test has mathematically proven time complexity, but is slower than elliptic curve primality proving in practice. These methods can be used to generate large random prime numbers, by generating and testing random numbers until finding one that is prime; when doing this, a faster probabilistic test can quickly eliminate most composite numbers before a guaranteed-correct algorithm is used to verify that the remaining numbers are prime.

The following table lists some of these tests. Their running time is given in terms of , the number to be tested and, for probabilistic algorithms, the number of tests performed. Moreover, formula_71 is an arbitrarily small positive number, and log is the logarithm to an unspecified base. The big O notation means that each time bound should be multiplied by a constant factor to convert it from dimensionless units to units of time; this factor depends on implementation details such as the type of computer used to run the algorithm, but not on the input parameters and .

=== Special-purpose algorithms and the largest known prime ===

In addition to the aforementioned tests that apply to any natural number, some numbers of a special form can be tested for primality more quickly. For example, the Lucas–Lehmer primality test can determine whether a Mersenne number (one less than a power of two) is prime, deterministically, in the same time as a single iteration of the Miller–Rabin test. This is why since 1992 () the largest &quot;known&quot; prime has always been a Mersenne prime. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes.

The following table gives the largest known primes of various types. Some of these primes have been found using distributed computing. In 2009, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project was awarded a US$100,000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits. The Electronic Frontier Foundation also offers $150,000 and $250,000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits, respectively.

=== Integer factorization ===

Given a composite integer , the task of providing one (or all) prime factors is referred to as &quot;factorization&quot; of . It is significantly more difficult than primality testing, and although many factorization algorithms are known, they are slower than the fastest primality testing methods. Trial division and Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm can be used to find very small factors of , and elliptic curve factorization can be effective when has factors of moderate size. Methods suitable for arbitrary large numbers that do not depend on the size of its factors include the quadratic sieve and general number field sieve. As with primality testing, there are also factorization algorithms that require their input to have a special form, including the special number field sieve. the largest number known to have been factored by a general-purpose algorithm is RSA-240, which has 240 decimal digits (795 bits) and is the product of two large primes.

Shor&#x27;s algorithm can factor any integer in a polynomial number of steps on a quantum computer. However, current technology can only run this algorithm for very small numbers. , the largest number that has been factored by a quantum computer running Shor&#x27;s algorithm is 21.

=== Other computational applications ===
Several public-key cryptography algorithms, such as RSA and the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, are based on large prime numbers (2048-bit primes are common). RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (that is, more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers and than to calculate and (assumed coprime) if only the product formula_62 is known. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation (computing ), while the reverse operation (the discrete logarithm) is thought to be a hard problem.

Prime numbers are frequently used for hash tables. For instance the original method of Carter and Wegman for universal hashing was based on computing hash functions by choosing random linear functions modulo large prime numbers. Carter and Wegman generalized this method to -independent hashing by using higher-degree polynomials, again modulo large primes. As well as in the hash function, prime numbers are used for the hash table size in quadratic probing based hash tables to ensure that the probe sequence covers the whole table.

Some checksum methods are based on the mathematics of prime numbers. For instance the checksums used in International Standard Book Numbers are defined by taking the rest of the number modulo , a prime number. Because is prime this method can detect both single-digit errors and transpositions of adjacent digits. Another checksum method, Adler-32, uses arithmetic modulo , the largest prime number less than . Prime numbers are also used in pseudorandom number generators including linear congruential generators and the Mersenne Twister.

== Other applications ==
Prime numbers are of central importance to number theory but also have many applications to other areas within mathematics, including abstract algebra and elementary geometry. For example, it is possible to place prime numbers of points in a two-dimensional grid so that no three are in a line, or so that every triangle formed by three of the points has large area. Another example is Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion, a test for whether a polynomial is irreducible based on divisibility of its coefficients by a prime number and its square.
The concept of a prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, &quot;prime&quot; indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field of a given field is its smallest subfield that contains both 0 and 1. It is either the field of rational numbers or a finite field with a prime number of elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the connected sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots. The prime decomposition of 3-manifolds is another example of this type.

Beyond mathematics and computing, prime numbers have potential connections to quantum mechanics, and have been used metaphorically in the arts and literature. They have also been used in evolutionary biology to explain the life cycles of cicadas.

=== Constructible polygons and polygon partitions ===

Fermat primes are primes of the form
: formula_73
with a nonnegative integer. They are named after Pierre de Fermat, who conjectured that all such numbers are prime. The first five of these numbers – 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65,537 – are prime, but formula_74 is composite and so are all other Fermat numbers that have been verified as of 2017. A regular -gon is constructible using straightedge and compass if and only if the odd prime factors of (if any) are distinct Fermat primes. Likewise, a regular -gon may be constructed using straightedge, compass, and an angle trisector if and only if the prime factors of  are any number of copies of 2 or 3 together with a (possibly empty) set of distinct Pierpont primes, primes of the form .

It is possible to partition any convex polygon into smaller convex polygons of equal area and equal perimeter, when is a power of a prime number, but this is not known for other values of .

=== Quantum mechanics ===
Beginning with the work of Hugh Montgomery and Freeman Dyson in the 1970s, mathematicians and physicists have speculated that the zeros of the Riemann zeta function are connected to the energy levels of quantum systems. Prime numbers are also significant in quantum information science, thanks to mathematical structures such as mutually unbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measures.

=== Biology ===
The evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus &quot;Magicicada&quot; makes use of prime numbers. These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. Biologists theorize that these prime-numbered breeding cycle lengths have evolved in order to prevent predators from synchronizing with these cycles. In contrast, the multi-year periods between flowering in bamboo plants are hypothesized to be smooth numbers, having only small prime numbers in their factorizations.

=== Arts and literature ===
Prime numbers have influenced many artists and writers. The French composer Olivier Messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through &quot;natural phenomena&quot;. In works such as &quot;La Nativité du Seigneur&quot; (1935) and &quot;Quatre études de rythme&quot; (1949–1950), he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms: the primes 41, 43, 47 and 53 appear in the third étude, &quot;Neumes rythmiques&quot;. According to Messiaen this way of composing was &quot;inspired by the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations&quot;.

In his science fiction novel &quot;Contact&quot;, scientist Carl Sagan suggested that prime factorization could be used as a means of establishing two-dimensional image planes in communications with aliens, an idea that he had first developed informally with American astronomer Frank Drake in 1975. In the novel &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; by Mark Haddon, the narrator arranges the sections of the story by consecutive prime numbers as a way to convey the mental state of its main character, a mathematically gifted teen with Asperger syndrome. Prime numbers are used as a metaphor for loneliness and isolation in the Paolo Giordano novel &quot;The Solitude of Prime Numbers&quot;, in which they are portrayed as &quot;outsiders&quot; among integers.

<text>Piers Anthony Dillingham Jacob (born August 6, 1934) is an American author in the science fiction and fantasy genres, publishing under the name Piers Anthony. He is best known for his long-running novel series set in the fictional realm of Xanth.

Many of his books have appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and he claims one of his greatest achievements has been to publish a book beginning with every letter of the alphabet, from &quot;Anthonology&quot; to &quot;Zombie Lover&quot;.

==Early life==
Anthony&#x27;s parents, Alfred and Norma Jacob, were Quaker pacifists studying at Oxford University who interrupted their studies in 1936 to undertake relief work on behalf of the Quakers during the Spanish Civil War, establishing a food kitchen for children in Barcelona. Piers and his sister were left in England in the care of their maternal grandparents and a nanny. Alfred Jacob, although a British citizen, had been born in America near Philadelphia, and in 1940, after being forced out of Spain and with the situation in Britain deteriorating, the family sailed to the United States. In 1941 the family settled in a rustic &quot;back to the land&quot; utopian community near Winhall, Vermont, where a young Piers made the acquaintance of radical author Scott Nearing, a neighbor. Both parents resumed their academic studies, and Alfred eventually became a professor of Romance languages, teaching at a number of colleges in the Philadelphia area.

Piers was moved around to a number of schools, eventually enrolling in Goddard College in Vermont where he graduated in 1956. On &quot;This American Life&quot; on July 27, 2012, Anthony revealed that his parents had divorced, he was bullied, and he had poor grades in school. Anthony referred to his high school as a &quot;very fancy private school&quot;, and refuses to donate money to it. He recalls being part of &quot;the lower crust&quot;, and that no one paid attention to, or cared about him. He said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like being a member of the underclass, of the peons like that&quot;.

==Marriage and early career==
Anthony met his future wife, Carol Marble, while both were attending college. They were married in 1956, the same year he graduated from Goddard College, and he subsequently worked as a handyman. In 1957, Anthony decided to join the United States Army, as his wife was pregnant and they needed both medical coverage and a steady source of income. During his two-year enlistment, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1958 and was editor and cartoonist for his battalion&#x27;s newspaper.

After completing military service, he briefly taught at Admiral Farragut Academy in St. Petersburg, Florida before deciding to try to become a full-time writer.

Anthony and his wife made a deal: if he could sell a piece of writing within one year, she would continue to work to support him. But if he could not sell anything in that year, then he would forever give up his dream of being a writer. At the end of the year, he managed to get a short story published. He credits his wife as the person who made his writing career possible, and he advises aspiring writers that they need to have a source of income other than their writing in order to get through the early years of a writing career.

==Writing==
On multiple occasions Anthony has moved from one publisher to another (taking a popular series with him) when he says he felt the editors were unduly tampering with his work. He has sued publishers for accounting malfeasance and won judgments in his favor. Anthony maintains an Internet Publishers Survey in the interest of helping aspiring writers. For this service, he won the 2003 &quot;Friend of EPIC&quot; award for service to the electronic publishing community. His website won the &quot;Special Recognition for Service to Writers&quot; award from Preditors and Editors, an author&#x27;s guide to publishers and writing services.

His popular novel series Xanth has been optioned for movies. It inspired the DOS video game &quot;Companions of Xanth&quot;, by Legend Entertainment. The same series also spawned the board game &quot;Xanth&quot; by Mayfair Games.

Anthony&#x27;s novels usually end with a chapter-long Author&#x27;s Note, in which he talks about himself, his life, and his experiences as they related to the process of writing the novel. He often discusses correspondence with readers and any real-world issues that influenced the novel.

Since about 2000, Anthony has written his novels in a Linux environment.

Anthony&#x27;s &quot;Xanth&quot; series was ranked No. 99 in a 2011 NPR readers&#x27; poll of best science fiction and fantasy books.

==In other media==
Act One of episode 470 of the radio program &quot;This American Life&quot; is an account of boyhood obsessions with Piers Anthony. The act is written and narrated by writer Logan Hill who, as a 12-year-old, was consumed with reading Anthony&#x27;s novels. For a decade he felt he must have been Anthony&#x27;s number one fan, until, when he was 22, he met &quot;Andy&quot; at a wedding and discovered their mutual interest in the writer. Andy is interviewed for the story and explains that, as a teenager, he had used escapist novels in order to cope with his alienating school and home life in Buffalo, New York. In 1987, at age 15, he decided to run away to Florida in order to try to live with Piers Anthony. The story includes Anthony&#x27;s reflections on these events.

Naomi King, the daughter of writer Stephen King, enjoyed reading books by Piers Anthony, which included things like pixies, imps and fairies. After she told her father she had, &quot;very little interest in my vampires, Ghoulies and slushy crawling things&quot;, he wrote &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; which was originally published in 1984 and later in 1987 by Viking Press.

==&quot;But What of Earth?&quot;==
Early in Anthony&#x27;s literary career, there was a dispute surrounding the original publication (1976) of &quot;But What of Earth?&quot;. Editor Roger Elwood commissioned the novel for his nascent science-fiction line Laser Books. According to Anthony, he completed &quot;But What of Earth?&quot;, and Elwood accepted and purchased it. Elwood then told Anthony that he wished to make several minor changes, and in order not to waste Anthony&#x27;s time, he had hired copy editor (and author) Robert Coulson to retype the manuscript with the changes. Anthony described Coulson as a friend and was initially open to his contribution.

However, Elwood told Coulson he was to be a full collaborator, free to make revisions to Anthony&#x27;s text in line with suggestions made by other copy editors. Elwood promised Coulson a 50–50 split with Anthony on all future royalties. According to Anthony, the published novel was very different from his version, with changes to characters and dialog, and with scenes added and removed. Anthony felt the changes worsened the novel. Laser&#x27;s ultimate publication of &quot;But What of Earth?&quot; listed Anthony and Coulson together as collaborators. Publication rights were reverted to Anthony under threat of legal action. In 1989, Anthony (re)published his original &quot;But What of Earth?&quot; in an annotated edition through Tor Books. This edition contains an introduction and conclusion setting out the story of the novel&#x27;s permutations and roughly 60 pages of notes by Anthony giving examples of changes to plot and characters, and describing some of the comments made by copy editors on his manuscript.

==Criticism==
Some critics have described Anthony&#x27;s portrayal of female characters as stereotypical and misogynistic, particularly in the early parts of the Xanth series, and have taken issue with themes of underage sexuality and eroticism within Anthony&#x27;s work. Anthony has argued in interviews that these critiques do not accurately reflect his work, and states that he gets more fan mail from female readers than male readers.

==Personal life==
He and his first wife, Carol Ann Marble Jacob, had two daughters, Penelope &quot;Penny&quot; Carolyn and Cheryl. Penny had one child, and died in 2009, due to complications from skin cancer. Carol Ann died at home on October 3, 2019, due to what is believed to have been heart related complications due to a 15-year-long battle with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).

On April 22, 2020, he married MaryLee Boyance. Anthony lived on his tree farm in Florida until March 2023, at which time he sold his farm and moved to California.

Anthony is a vegetarian.

==Religious beliefs ==
Regarding his religious beliefs, Anthony wrote in the October 2004 entry of his personal website, &quot;I&#x27;m agnostic, which means I regard the case as unproven, but I&#x27;m much closer to the atheist position than to the theist one.&quot; In 2017 he stated, &quot;I am more certain about God and the Afterlife: they don&#x27;t exist.&quot;

<doc id="23670" wikidata="Q170043" url="?curid=23670" title="Perfect number">
<text>In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive proper divisors, that is, divisors excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has proper divisors 1, 2 and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. The next perfect number is 28, since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.

The first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496 and 8128.

The sum of proper divisors of a number is called its aliquot sum, so a perfect number is one that is equal to its aliquot sum. Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors; in symbols, formula_1 where formula_2 is the sum-of-divisors function.

This definition is ancient, appearing as early as Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; (VII.22) where it is called (&quot;perfect&quot;, &quot;ideal&quot;, or &quot;complete number&quot;). Euclid also proved a formation rule (IX.36) whereby formula_3 is an even perfect number whenever formula_4 is a prime of the form formula_5 for positive integer formula_6—what is now called a Mersenne prime. Two millennia later, Leonhard Euler proved that all even perfect numbers are of this form. This is known as the Euclid–Euler theorem.

It is not known whether there are any odd perfect numbers, nor whether infinitely many perfect numbers exist.

== History ==
In about 300 BC Euclid showed that if 2&quot;p&quot; − 1 is prime then 2&quot;p&quot;−1(2&quot;p&quot; − 1) is perfect.
The first four perfect numbers were the only ones known to early Greek mathematics, and the mathematician Nicomachus noted 8128 as early as around AD 100. In modern language, Nicomachus states without proof that perfect number is of the form formula_7 where formula_8 is prime. He seems to be unaware that itself has to be prime. He also says (wrongly) that the perfect numbers end in 6 or 8 alternately. (The first 5 perfect numbers end with digits 6, 8, 6, 8, 6; but the sixth also ends in 6.) Philo of Alexandria in his first-century book &quot;On the creation&quot; mentions perfect numbers, claiming that the world was created in 6 days and the moon orbits in 28 days because 6 and 28 are perfect. Philo is followed by Origen, and by Didymus the Blind, who adds the observation that there are only four perfect numbers that are less than 10,000. (Commentary on Genesis 1. 14–19). St Augustine defines perfect numbers in City of God (Book XI, Chapter 30) in the early 5th century AD, repeating the claim that God created the world in 6 days because 6 is the smallest perfect number. The Egyptian mathematician Ismail ibn Fallūs (1194–1252) mentioned the next three perfect numbers (33,550,336; 8,589,869,056; and 137,438,691,328) and listed a few more which are now known to be incorrect. The first known European mention of the fifth perfect number is a manuscript written between 1456 and 1461 by an unknown mathematician. In 1588, the Italian mathematician Pietro Cataldi identified the sixth (8,589,869,056) and the seventh (137,438,691,328) perfect numbers, and also proved that every perfect number obtained from Euclid&#x27;s rule ends with a 6 or an 8.

== Even perfect numbers ==
Euclid proved that formula_9 is an even perfect number whenever formula_5 is prime (&quot;Elements&quot;, Prop. IX.36).

For example, the first four perfect numbers are generated by the formula formula_11 with a prime number, as follows:
formula_12

Prime numbers of the form formula_5 are known as Mersenne primes, after the seventeenth-century monk Marin Mersenne, who studied number theory and perfect numbers. For formula_5 to be prime, it is necessary that itself be prime. However, not all numbers of the form formula_5 with a prime are prime; for example, is not a prime number. In fact, Mersenne primes are very rare: of the approximately 4 million primes up to 68,874,199, formula_5 is prime for only 48 of them.

While Nicomachus had stated (without proof) that perfect numbers were of the form formula_7 where formula_8 is prime (though he stated this somewhat differently), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) circa AD 1000 was unwilling to go that far, declaring instead (also without proof) that the formula yielded only every even perfect number. It was not until the 18th century that Leonhard Euler proved that the formula formula_9 will yield all the even perfect numbers. Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes; each Mersenne prime generates one even perfect number, and vice versa. This result is often referred to as the Euclid–Euler theorem.

An exhaustive search by the GIMPS distributed computing project has shown that the first 48 even perfect numbers are formula_9 for
: = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281, 3217, 4253, 4423, 9689, 9941, 11213, 19937, 21701, 23209, 44497, 86243, 110503, 132049, 216091, 756839, 859433, 1257787, 1398269, 2976221, 3021377, 6972593, 13466917, 20996011, 24036583, 25964951, 30402457, 32582657, 37156667, 42643801, 43112609 and 57885161 .

Four higher perfect numbers have also been discovered, namely those for which = 74207281, 77232917, 82589933 and 136279841. Although it is still possible there may be others within this range, initial but exhaustive tests by GIMPS have revealed no other perfect numbers for below 109332539. , 52 Mersenne primes are known, and therefore 52 even perfect numbers (the largest of which is with 82,048,640 digits). It is not known whether there are infinitely many perfect numbers, nor whether there are infinitely many Mersenne primes.

As well as having the form formula_9, each even perfect number is the formula_22-th triangular number (and hence equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to formula_5) and the formula_24-th hexagonal number. Furthermore, each even perfect number except for 6 is the formula_25-th centered nonagonal number and is equal to the sum of the first formula_26 odd cubes (odd cubes up to the cube of formula_27):

formula_28

Even perfect numbers (except 6) are of the form
formula_29

with each resulting triangular number , , (after subtracting 1 from the perfect number and dividing the result by 9) ending in 3 or 5, the sequence starting with , , , It follows that by adding the digits of any even perfect number (except 6), then adding the digits of the resulting number, and repeating this process until a single digit (called the digital root) is obtained, always produces the number 1. For example, the digital root of 8128 is 1, because , , and . This works with all perfect numbers formula_9 with odd prime and, in fact, with numbers of the form formula_31 for odd integer (not necessarily prime) .

Owing to their form, formula_11 every even perfect number is represented in binary form as ones followed by zeros; for example:

formula_33

Thus every even perfect number is a pernicious number.

Every even perfect number is also a practical number (cf. Related concepts).

== Odd perfect numbers ==

It is unknown whether any odd perfect numbers exist, though various results have been obtained. In 1496, Jacques Lefèvre stated that Euclid&#x27;s rule gives all perfect numbers, thus implying that no odd perfect number exists, but Euler himself stated: &quot;Whether ... there are any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question&quot;. More recently, Carl Pomerance has presented a heuristic argument suggesting that indeed no odd perfect number should exist. All perfect numbers are also harmonic divisor numbers, and it has been conjectured as well that there are no odd harmonic divisor numbers other than 1. Many of the properties proved about odd perfect numbers also apply to Descartes numbers, and Pace Nielsen has suggested that sufficient study of those numbers may lead to a proof that no odd perfect numbers exist.

Any odd perfect number &quot;N&quot; must satisfy the following conditions:
* &quot;N&quot; &gt; 101500.
* &quot;N&quot; is not divisible by 105.
* &quot;N&quot; is of the form &quot;N&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 12) or &quot;N&quot; ≡ 117 (mod 468) or &quot;N&quot; ≡ 81 (mod 324).
* The largest prime factor of &quot;N&quot; is greater than 108, and less than formula_34 
* The second largest prime factor is greater than 104, and is less than formula_35. 
* The third largest prime factor is greater than 100, and less than formula_36 
* &quot;N&quot; has at least 101 prime factors and at least 10 distinct prime factors. If 3 does not divide &quot;N&quot;, then &quot;N&quot; has at least 12 distinct prime factors.
* &quot;N&quot; is of the form
::formula_37
:where:
:* &quot;q&quot;, &quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; are distinct odd primes (Euler).
:* &quot;q&quot; ≡ α ≡ 1 (mod 4) (Euler).
:* The smallest prime factor of &quot;N&quot; is at most formula_38
:* At least one of the prime powers dividing &quot;N&quot; exceeds 1062.
:* formula_39
:* formula_40.
:* formula_41.
:* formula_42.

Furthermore, several minor results are known about the exponents
&quot;e&quot;1, ..., &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;.
* Not all &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 3).
* Not all &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≡ 2 (mod 5).
* If all &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 3) or 2 (mod 5), then the smallest prime factor of &quot;N&quot; must lie between 108 and 101000.
* More generally, if all 2&quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 have a prime factor in a given finite set &quot;S&quot;, then the smallest prime factor of &quot;N&quot; must be smaller than an effectively computable constant depending only on &quot;S&quot;.
* If (&quot;e&quot;1, ..., &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;) =  (1, ..., 1, 2, ..., 2) with &quot;t&quot; ones and &quot;u&quot; twos, then formula_43.
* (&quot;e&quot;1, ..., &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;) ≠ (1, ..., 1, 3), (1, ..., 1, 5), (1, ..., 1, 6).
* If , then
** &quot;e&quot; cannot be 3, 5, 24, 6, 8, 11, 14 or 18.
** formula_44 and formula_45.

In 1888, Sylvester stated:
== Minor results ==
All even perfect numbers have a very precise form; odd perfect numbers either do not exist or are rare. There are a number of results on perfect numbers that are actually quite easy to prove but nevertheless superficially impressive; some of them also come under Richard Guy&#x27;s strong law of small numbers:
* The only even perfect number of the form &quot;n&quot;3 + 1 is 28 .
* 28 is also the only even perfect number that is a sum of two positive cubes of integers .
* The reciprocals of the divisors of a perfect number &quot;N&quot; must add up to 2 (to get this, take the definition of a perfect number, formula_46, and divide both sides by &quot;n&quot;):
** For 6, we have formula_47;
** For 28, we have formula_48, etc.
* The number of divisors of a perfect number (whether even or odd) must be even, because &quot;N&quot; cannot be a perfect square.
** From these two results it follows that every perfect number is an Ore&#x27;s harmonic number.
* The even perfect numbers are not trapezoidal numbers; that is, they cannot be represented as the difference of two positive non-consecutive triangular numbers. There are only three types of non-trapezoidal numbers: even perfect numbers, powers of two, and the numbers of the form formula_49 formed as the product of a Fermat prime formula_50 with a power of two in a similar way to the construction of even perfect numbers from Mersenne primes.
* The number of perfect numbers less than &quot;n&quot; is less than formula_51, where &quot;c&quot; &gt; 0 is a constant. In fact it is formula_52, using little-o notation.
* Every even perfect number ends in 6 or 28, base ten; and, with the only exception of 6, ends in 1 in base 9. Therefore, in particular the digital root of every even perfect number other than 6 is 1. 
* The only square-free perfect number is 6.

The sum of proper divisors gives various other kinds of numbers. Numbers where the sum is less than the number itself are called deficient, and where it is greater than the number, abundant. These terms, together with &quot;perfect&quot; itself, come from Greek numerology. A pair of numbers which are the sum of each other&#x27;s proper divisors are called amicable, and larger cycles of numbers are called sociable. A positive integer such that every smaller positive integer is a sum of distinct divisors of it is a practical number.

By definition, a perfect number is a fixed point of the restricted divisor function , and the aliquot sequence associated with a perfect number is a constant sequence. All perfect numbers are also formula_53-perfect numbers, or Granville numbers.

A semiperfect number is a natural number that is equal to the sum of all or some of its proper divisors. A semiperfect number that is equal to the sum of all its proper divisors is a perfect number. Most abundant numbers are also semiperfect; abundant numbers which are not semiperfect are called weird numbers.

<doc id="23672" wikidata="Q10288" url="?curid=23672" title="Parthenon">
<text>The Parthenon (; ; ) is a former temple on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, that was dedicated to the goddess Athena. Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of classical Greek art, and the Parthenon is considered an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece, democracy, and Western civilization. 

The Parthenon was built in the 5th century BC in thanksgiving for the Hellenic victory over Persian Empire invaders during the Greco-Persian Wars. Like most Greek temples, the Parthenon also served as the city treasury. Construction started in 447 BC when the Delian League was at the peak of its power. It was completed in 438 BC; work on the artwork and decorations continued until 432 BC. For a time, it served as the treasury of the Delian League, which later became the Athenian Empire.

In the final decade of the 6th century AD, the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. After the Ottoman conquest in the mid-15th century, it became a mosque. In the Morean War, a Venetian bomb landed on the Parthenon, which the Ottomans had used as a munitions dump, during the 1687 siege of the Acropolis. The resulting explosion severely damaged the Parthenon. From 1800 to 1803, the 7th Earl of Elgin controversially removed many of the surviving sculptures and subsequently shipped them to England where they are now known as the &quot;Elgin Marbles&quot; or Parthenon marbles. Since 1975, numerous large-scale restoration projects have been undertaken to preserve remaining artefacts and ensure its structural integrity.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;Parthenon&quot; comes from the Greek word (), meaning &quot;maiden, girl&quot; as well as &quot;virgin, unmarried woman&quot;. The Liddell–Scott–Jones &quot;Greek–English Lexicon&quot; states that it may have referred to the &quot;unmarried women&#x27;s apartments&quot; in a house, but that in the Parthenon it seems to have been used for a particular room of the temple. There is some debate as to which room that was. The lexicon states that this room was the western cella of the Parthenon. This has also been suggested by J.B. Bury. One theory is that the Parthenon was the room where the &quot;arrephoroi&quot;, a group of four young girls chosen to serve Athena each year, wove a peplos that was presented to Athena during Panathenaic Festivals. Christopher Pelling asserts that the name &quot;Parthenon&quot; means the &quot;temple of the virgin goddess&quot;, referring to the cult of Athena Parthenos that was associated with the temple. It has also been suggested that the name of the temple alludes to the maidens (), whose supreme sacrifice guaranteed the safety of the city. In that case, the room originally known as the Parthenon could have been a part of the temple known today as the Erechtheion.

In 5th-century BC accounts of the building, the structure is simply called (; &quot;the temple&quot;). Douglas Frame writes that the name &quot;Parthenon&quot; was a nickname related to the statue of Athena Parthenos, and only appeared a century after construction. He contends that &quot;Athena&#x27;s temple was never officially called the Parthenon and she herself most likely never had the cult title &quot;parthénos&quot;&quot;. The ancient architects Iktinos and Callicrates appear to have called the building (; &quot;the hundred footer&quot;) in their lost treatise on Athenian architecture. Harpocration wrote that some people used to call the Parthenon the &quot;Hekatompedos&quot;, not due to its size but because of its beauty and fine proportions. The first instance in which Parthenon definitely refers to the entire building comes from the fourth century BC orator Demosthenes. In the 4th century BC and later, the building was referred to as the &#x27; or the as well as the &quot;Parthenon.&quot; Plutarch referred to the building during the first century AD as the &#x27;.

A 2020 study by Janric van Rookhuijzen supports the idea that the building known today as the Parthenon was originally called the Hekatompedon. Based on literary and historical research, he proposes that &quot;the treasury called the Parthenon should be recognized as the west part of the building now conventionally known as the Erechtheion&quot;.

Because the Parthenon was dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena it has sometimes been referred to as the Temple of Minerva, the Roman name for Athena, particularly during the 19th century.

 was also applied to the Virgin Mary (&quot;Parthénos Maria&quot;) when the Parthenon was converted to a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in the final decade of the 6th century.

==Function==
Although the Parthenon is architecturally a temple and is usually called so, some scholars have argued that it is not really a temple in the conventional sense of the word. A small shrine has been excavated within the building, on the site of an older sanctuary probably dedicated to Athena as a way to get closer to the goddess, but the Parthenon apparently never hosted the official cult of Athena Polias, patron of Athens. The cult image of Athena Polias, which was bathed in the sea and to which was presented the &quot;peplos&quot;, was an olive-wood &quot;xoanon&quot;, located in another temple on the northern side of the Acropolis, more closely associated with the Great Altar of Athena. The High Priestess of Athena Polias supervised the city cult of Athena based in the Acropolis, and was the chief of the lesser officials, such as the plyntrides, arrephoroi and kanephoroi.

The colossal statue of Athena by Phidias was not specifically related to any cult attested by ancient authors and is not known to have inspired any religious fervour. Preserved ancient sources do not associate it with any priestess, altar or cult name.

According to Thucydides, during the Peloponnesian War when Sparta&#x27;s forces were first preparing to invade Attica, Pericles, in an address to the Athenian people, said that the statue could be used as a gold reserve if that was necessary to preserve Athens, stressing that it &quot;contained forty talents of pure gold and it was all removable&quot;, but adding that the gold would afterward have to be restored. The Athenian statesman thus implies that the metal, obtained from contemporary coinage, could be used again if absolutely necessary without any impiety. According to Aristotle, the building also contained golden figures that he described as &quot;Victories&quot;. The classicist Harris Rackham noted that eight of those figures were melted down for coinage during the Peloponnesian War. Other Greek writers have claimed that treasures such as Persian swords were also stored inside the temple. Some scholars, therefore, argue that the Parthenon should be viewed as a grand setting for a monumental votive statue rather than as a cult site.

Archaeologist Joan Breton Connelly has argued for the coherency of the Parthenon&#x27;s sculptural programme in presenting a succession of genealogical narratives that track Athenian identity through the ages: from the birth of Athena, through and epic battles, to the final great event of the Athenian Bronze Age, the war of Erechtheus and Eumolpos. She argues a pedagogical function for the Parthenon&#x27;s sculptured decoration, one that establishes and perpetuates Athenian foundation myth, memory, values and identity. While some classicists, including Mary Beard, Peter Green, and Garry Wills have doubted or rejected Connelly&#x27;s thesis, an increasing number of historians, archaeologists, and classical scholars support her work. They include: J.J. Pollitt, Brunilde Ridgway, Nigel Spivey, Caroline Alexander, and A. E. Stallings.

===Older Parthenon===
The first endeavour to build a sanctuary for Athena Parthenos on the site of the present Parthenon was begun shortly after the Battle of Marathon (–488 BC) upon a solid limestone foundation that extended and levelled the southern part of the Acropolis summit. This building replaced a Hekatompedon temple (&quot;hundred-footer&quot;) and would have stood beside the archaic temple dedicated to &quot;Athena Polias&quot; (&quot;of the city&quot;). The Older or Pre-Parthenon, as it is frequently referred to, was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC razing the Acropolis.

The existence of both the proto-Parthenon and its destruction were known from Herodotus, and the drums of its columns were visibly built into the curtain wall north of the Erechtheion. Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of Panagiotis Kavvadias of 1885–1890. The findings of this dig allowed Wilhelm Dörpfeld, then director of the German Archaeological Institute, to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by Dörpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as previously assumed. Dörpfeld&#x27;s observation was that the three steps of the first Parthenon consisted of two steps of Poros limestone, the same as the foundations, and a top step of Karrha limestone that was covered by the lowest step of the Periclean Parthenon. This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a different building, now completely covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885–1890 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.
If the original Parthenon was indeed destroyed in 480, it invites the question of why the site was left as a ruin for thirty-three years. One argument involves the oath sworn by the Greek allies before the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC declaring that the sanctuaries destroyed by the Persians would not be rebuilt, an oath from which the Athenians were only absolved with the Peace of Callias in 450. The cost of reconstructing Athens after the Persian sack is at least as likely a cause. The excavations of Bert Hodge Hill led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of Kimon after 468. Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step Dörpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at .

One difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation, the archaeological method of seriation was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information. An attempt to make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925–1933. This inspired American archaeologist William Bell Dinsmoor to give limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the re-terracing of the Acropolis. Dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for Parthenon I was no earlier than 495 BC, contradicting the early date given by Dörpfeld. He denied that there were two proto-Parthenons, and held that the only pre-Periclean temple was what Dörpfeld referred to as Parthenon II. Dinsmoor and Dörpfeld exchanged views in the &quot;American Journal of Archaeology&quot; in 1935.

===Present building===

In the mid-5th century BC, when the Athenian Acropolis became the seat of the Delian League, Pericles initiated the building project that lasted the entire second half of the century. The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today – the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and the temple of Athena Nike – were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of Phidias, who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects Ictinos and Callicrates began their work in 447, and the building was substantially completed by 432. Work on the decorations continued until at least 431.

The Parthenon was built primarily by men who knew how to work marble. These quarrymen had exceptional skills and were able to cut the blocks of marble to very specific measurements. The quarrymen also knew how to avoid the faults, which were numerous in the Pentelic marble. If the marble blocks were not up to standard, the architects would reject them. The marble was worked with iron tools – picks, points, punches, chisels, and drills. The quarrymen would hold their tools against the marble block and firmly tap the surface of the rock.

A big project like the Parthenon attracted stonemasons from far and wide who travelled to Athens to assist in the project. Slaves and foreigners worked together with the Athenian citizens in the building of the Parthenon, doing the same jobs for the same pay. Temple building was a specialized craft, and there were not many men in Greece qualified to build temples like the Parthenon, so these men would travel and work where they were needed.

Other craftsmen were necessary for the building of the Parthenon, specifically carpenters and metalworkers. Unskilled labourers also had key roles in the building of the Parthenon. They loaded and unloaded the marble blocks and moved the blocks from place to place. In order to complete a project like the Parthenon, many different labourers were needed.

==Architecture==
The Parthenon is a peripteral octastyle Doric temple with Ionic architectural features. It stands on a platform or stylobate of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of post and lintel construction and is surrounded by columns (&#x27;peripteral&#x27;) carrying an entablature. There are eight columns at either end (&#x27;octastyle&#x27;) and seventeen on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the &quot;cella,&quot; which is divided into two compartments. The &quot;opisthodomos&quot; (the back room of the cella) contained the monetary contributions of the Delian League. At either end of the building, the gable is finished with a triangular pediment originally occupied by sculpted figures.

The Parthenon has been described as &quot;the culmination of the development of the Doric order&quot;. The Doric columns, for example, have simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a frieze of carved pictorial panels (metopes), separated by formal architectural triglyphs, also typical of the Doric order. The continuous frieze in low relief around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns, in contrast, reflects the Ionic order. Architectural historian John R. Senseney suggests that this unexpected switch between orders was due to an aesthetic choice on the part of builders during construction, and was likely not part of the original plan of the Parthenon.

Measured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are . The cella was 29.8 metres long by 19.2 metres wide (97.8 × 63.0 ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure in diameter and are high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column having 20 flutes. (A flute is the shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as imbrices and tegulae.

The Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. John Julius Cooper wrote that &quot;even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the naos walls, and the entasis of the columns&quot;. Entasis refers to the slight swelling, of , in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples, it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outward, but they actually lean slightly inward so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly above the centre of the Parthenon. Since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the architrave and roof above: &quot;All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves&quot;, Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.
It is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these &quot;optical refinements&quot; was. They may serve as a sort of &quot;reverse optical illusion&quot;. As the Greeks may have been aware, two parallel lines appear to bow, or curve outward, when intersected by converging lines. In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers might have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves. But the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon&#x27;s more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.

Some studies of the Acropolis, including of the Parthenon and its facade, have conjectured that many of its proportions approximate the golden ratio. More recent studies have shown that the proportions of the Parthenon do not match the golden proportion.

==Sculpture==
The cella of the Parthenon housed the chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos sculpted by Phidias and dedicated in 439 or 438 BC. The appearance of this is known from other images. The decorative stonework was originally highly coloured. The temple was dedicated to Athena at that time, though construction continued until almost the beginning of the Peloponnesian War in 432. By the year 438, the Doric metopes on the frieze above the exterior colonnade and the Ionic frieze around the upper portion of the walls of the cella had been completed.

Only a small number of the original sculptures remain &quot;in situ.&quot; Most of the surviving sculptures are at the Acropolis Museum in Athens and at the British Museum in London (see Elgin Marbles). Additional pieces are at the Louvre, the National Museum of Denmark, and Vienna.

In March 2022, the Acropolis Museum launched a new website with &quot;photographs of all the frieze blocks preserved today in the Acropolis Museum, the British Museum and the Louvre&quot;.

===Metopes===

The frieze of the Parthenon&#x27;s entablature contained 92 metopes, 14 each on the east and west sides, 32 each on the north and south sides. They were carved in high relief, a practice employed until then only in treasuries (buildings used to keep votive gifts to the gods). According to the building records, the metope sculptures date to the years 446–440. The metopes of the east side of the Parthenon, above the main entrance, depict the Gigantomachy (the mythical battle between the Olympian gods and the Giants). The metopes of the west end show the Amazonomachy (the mythical battle of the Athenians against the Amazons). The metopes of the south side show the Thessalian Centauromachy (battle of the Lapiths aided by Theseus against the half-man, half-horse Centaurs). Metopes 13–21 are missing, but drawings from 1674 attributed to Jaques Carrey indicate a series of humans; these have been variously interpreted as scenes from the Lapith wedding, scenes from the early history of Athens, and various myths. On the north side of the Parthenon, the metopes are poorly preserved, but the subject seems to be the sack of Troy.

The mythological figures of the metopes of the East, North, and West sides of the Parthenon had been deliberately mutilated by Christian iconoclasts in late antiquity.

The metopes present examples of the Severe Style in the anatomy of the figures&#x27; heads, in the limitation of the corporal movements to the contours and not to the muscles, and in the presence of pronounced veins in the figures of the Centauromachy. Several of the metopes still remain on the building, but, with the exception of those on the northern side, they are severely damaged. Some of them are located at the Acropolis Museum, others are in the British Museum, and one is at the Louvre museum.

In March 2011, archaeologists announced that they had discovered five metopes of the Parthenon in the south wall of the Acropolis, which had been extended when the Acropolis was used as a fortress. According to &quot;Eleftherotypia&quot; daily, the archaeologists claimed the metopes had been placed there in the 18th century when the Acropolis wall was being repaired. The experts discovered the metopes while processing 2,250 photos with modern photographic methods, as the white Pentelic marble they are made of differed from the other stone of the wall. It was previously presumed that the missing metopes were destroyed during the Morosini explosion of the Parthenon in 1687.

===Frieze===

The most characteristic feature in the architecture and decoration of the temple is the Ionic frieze running around the exterior of the cella walls. The bas-relief frieze was carved in situ and is dated from –438.

One interpretation is that it depicts an idealized version of the Panathenaic procession from the Dipylon Gate in the Kerameikos to the Acropolis. In this procession held every year, with a special procession taking place every four years, Athenians and foreigners participated in honouring the goddess Athena by offering her sacrifices and a new peplos dress, woven by selected noble Athenian girls called . The procession is more crowded (appearing to slow in pace) as it nears the gods on the eastern side of the temple.

Joan Breton Connelly offers a mythological interpretation for the frieze, one that is in harmony with the rest of the temple&#x27;s sculptural programme which shows Athenian genealogy through a series of succession myths set in the remote past. She identifies the central panel above the door of the Parthenon as the pre-battle sacrifice of the daughter of the king Erechtheus, a sacrifice that ensured Athenian victory over Eumolpos and his Thracian army. The great procession marching toward the east end of the Parthenon shows the post-battle thanksgiving sacrifice of cattle and sheep, honey and water, followed by the triumphant army of Erechtheus returning from their victory. This represents the first Panathenaia set in mythical times, the model on which historic Panathenaic processions were based. This interpretation has been rejected by William St Clair, who considers that the frieze shows the celebration of the birth of Ion, who was a descendant of Erechtheus. This interpretation has been rejected by Catharine Titi, who agrees with St Clair that the mood is one of celebration (rather than sacrifice) but argues that the celebration of the birth of Ion requires the presence of an infant but there is no infant on the frieze.

===Pediments===
Two pediments rise above the portals of the Parthenon, one on the east front, one on the west. The triangular sections once contained massive sculptures that, according to the second-century geographer Pausanias, recounted the birth of Athena and the mythological battle between Athena and Poseidon for control of Athens.

====East pediment====

The east pediment originally contained 10 to 12 sculptures depicting the Birth of Athena. Most of those pieces were removed and lost during renovations in either the eighth or the twelfth century. Only two corners remain today with figures depicting the passage of time over the course of a full day. Tethrippa of Helios is in the left corner and Selene is on the right. The horses of Helios&#x27;s chariot are shown with livid expressions as they ascend into the sky at the start of the day. Selene&#x27;s horses struggle to stay on the pediment scene as the day comes to an end.

====West pediment====
The supporters of Athena are extensively illustrated at the back of the left chariot, while the defenders of Poseidon are shown trailing behind the right chariot. It is believed that the corners of the pediment are filled by Athenian water deities, such as the Kephisos river, the Ilissos river, and nymph Kallirhoe. This belief emerges from the fluid character of the sculptures&#x27; body position which represents the effort of the artist to give the impression of a flowing river. Next to the left river god, there are the sculptures of the mythical king of Athens (Cecrops or Kekrops) with his daughters (Aglaurus, Pandrosos, Herse). The statue of Poseidon was the largest sculpture in the pediment until it broke into pieces during Francesco Morosini&#x27;s effort to remove it in 1688. The posterior piece of the torso was found by Lusieri in the groundwork of a Turkish house in 1801 and is currently held in the British Museum. The anterior portion was revealed by Ross in 1835 and is now held in the Acropolis Museum of Athens.

Every statue on the west pediment has a fully completed back, which would have been impossible to see when the sculpture was on the temple; this indicates that the sculptors put great effort into accurately portraying the human body.

===Athena Parthenos===
The only piece of sculpture from the Parthenon known to be from the hand of Phidias was the statue of Athena housed in the &quot;naos&quot;. This massive chryselephantine sculpture is now lost and known only from copies, vase painting, gems, literary descriptions, and coins.

==Later history==
===Late antiquity===

A major fire broke out in the Parthenon shortly after the middle of the third century AD. which destroyed the roof and much of the sanctuary&#x27;s interior. Heruli pirates sacked Athens in 276, and destroyed most of the public buildings there, including the Parthenon. Repairs were made in the fourth century AD, possibly during the reign of Julian the Apostate. A new wooden roof overlaid with clay tiles was installed to cover the sanctuary. It sloped at a greater angle than the original roof and left the building&#x27;s wings exposed.

The Parthenon survived as a temple dedicated to Athena for nearly 1,000 years until Theodosius II, during the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, decreed in 435 that all pagan temples in the Eastern Roman Empire be closed. It is debated exactly when during the 5th century that the closure of the Parthenon as a temple was put into practice. It is suggested to have occurred in –484, on the order of Emperor Zeno, because the temple had been the focus of Pagan Hellenic opposition against Zeno in Athens in support of Illus, who had promised to restore Hellenic rites to the temples that were still standing.

At some point in the fifth century, Athena&#x27;s great cult image was looted by one of the emperors and taken to Constantinople, where it was later destroyed, possibly during the siege and sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 AD.

===Christian church===
The Parthenon was converted into a Christian church in the final decades of the fifth century to become the Church of the Parthenos Maria (Virgin Mary) or the Church of the Theotokos (Mother of God). The orientation of the building was changed to face towards the east; the main entrance was placed at the building&#x27;s western end, and the Christian altar and iconostasis were situated towards the building&#x27;s eastern side adjacent to an apse built where the temple&#x27;s pronaos was formerly located. A large central portal with surrounding side-doors was made in the wall dividing the cella, which became the church&#x27;s nave, and from the rear chamber, the church&#x27;s narthex. The spaces between the columns of the and the peristyle were walled up, though a number of doorways still permitted access. Icons were painted on the walls, and many Christian inscriptions were carved into the Parthenon&#x27;s columns. These renovations inevitably led to the removal and dispersal of some of the sculptures. Sometime after the Parthenon was converted to a Christian church, the metopes of the north, west and east facades of the Parthenon were defaced by Christians in order to remove images of pagan deities. The damage was so extensive that the images on the affected metopes often can&#x27;t be confidently identified.

The Parthenon became the fourth most important Christian pilgrimage destination in the Eastern Roman Empire after Constantinople, Ephesos, and Thessaloniki. In 1018, the emperor Basil II went on a pilgrimage to Athens after his final victory over the First Bulgarian Empire for the sole purpose of worshipping at the Parthenon. In medieval Greek accounts it is called the Temple of Theotokos Atheniotissa and often indirectly referred to as famous without explaining exactly which temple they were referring to, thus establishing that it was indeed well known.

At the time of the Latin occupation, it became for about 250 years a Roman Catholic church of Our Lady. During this period a tower, used either as a watchtower or bell tower and containing a spiral staircase, was constructed at the southwest corner of the cella, and vaulted tombs were built beneath the Parthenon&#x27;s floor.

The rediscovery of the Parthenon as an ancient monument dates back to the period of Humanism; Cyriacus of Ancona was the first after antiquity to describe the Parthenon, of which he had read many times in ancient texts. Thanks to him, Western Europe was able to have the first design of the monument, which Ciriaco called &quot;temple of the goddess Athena&quot;, unlike previous travellers, who had called it &quot;church of Virgin Mary&quot;:

&quot;...mirabile Palladis Divae marmoreum templum, divum quippe opus Phidiae&quot; (&quot;...the wonderful temple of the goddess Athena, a divine work of Phidias&quot;).

===Islamic mosque===

In 1456, Ottoman Turkish forces invaded Athens and laid siege to a Florentine army defending the Acropolis until June 1458, when it surrendered to the Turks. The Turks may have briefly restored the Parthenon to the Greek Orthodox Christians for continued use as a church. Some time before the end of the fifteenth century, the Parthenon became a mosque.

The precise circumstances under which the Turks appropriated it for use as a mosque are unclear; one account states that Mehmed II ordered its conversion as punishment for an Athenian plot against Ottoman rule. The apse was repurposed into a mihrab, the tower previously constructed during the Roman Catholic occupation of the Parthenon was extended upwards to become a minaret, a minbar was installed, the Christian altar and iconostasis were removed, and the walls were whitewashed to cover icons of Christian saints and other Christian imagery.

Despite the alterations accompanying the Parthenon&#x27;s conversion into a church and subsequently a mosque, its structure had remained basically intact. In 1667, the Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi expressed marvel at the Parthenon&#x27;s sculptures and figuratively described the building as &quot;like some impregnable fortress not made by human agency&quot;. He composed a poetic supplication stating that, as &quot;a work less of human hands than of Heaven itself, [it] should remain standing for all time&quot;. The French artist Jacques Carrey in 1674 visited the Acropolis and sketched the Parthenon&#x27;s sculptural decorations. Early in 1687, an engineer named Plantier sketched the Parthenon for the Frenchman Graviers d&#x27;Ortières. These depictions, particularly Carrey&#x27;s, provide important, and sometimes the only, evidence of the condition of the Parthenon and its various sculptures prior to the devastation it suffered in late 1687 and the subsequent looting of its art objects.

===Partial destruction===

As part of the Morean War (1684–1699), the Venetians sent an expedition led by Francesco Morosini to attack Athens and capture the Acropolis. The Ottomans fortified the Acropolis and used the Parthenon as a gunpowder magazine – despite having been forewarned of the dangers of this use by the 1656 explosion that severely damaged the Propylaea – and as a shelter for members of the local Turkish community.

On 26 September 1687 a Venetian mortar round, fired from the Hill of Philopappos, blew up the magazine. The explosion blew out the building&#x27;s central portion and caused the cella&#x27;s walls to crumble into rubble. According to Greek architect and archaeologist Kornilia Chatziaslani:

About three hundred people were killed in the explosion, which showered marble fragments over nearby Turkish defenders and sparked fires that destroyed many homes.
Accounts written at the time conflict over whether this destruction was deliberate or accidental; one such account, written by the German officer Sobievolski, states that a Turkish deserter revealed to Morosini the use to which the Turks had put the Parthenon; expecting that the Venetians would not target a building of such historic importance. Morosini was said to have responded by directing his artillery to aim at the Parthenon. Subsequently, Morosini sought to loot sculptures from the ruin and caused further damage in the process. Sculptures of Poseidon and Athena&#x27;s horses fell to the ground and smashed as his soldiers tried to detach them from the building&#x27;s west pediment.

In 1688 the Venetians abandoned Athens to avoid a confrontation with a large force the Turks had assembled at Chalcis; at that time, the Venetians had considered blowing up what remained of the Parthenon along with the rest of the Acropolis to deny its further use as a fortification to the Turks, but that idea was not pursued.

Once the Turks had recaptured the Acropolis, they used some of the rubble produced by this explosion to erect a smaller mosque within the shell of the ruined Parthenon. For the next century and a half, parts of the remaining structure were looted for building material and especially valuable objects.

The 18th century was a period of Ottoman stagnation—so that many more Europeans found access to Athens, and the picturesque ruins of the Parthenon were much drawn and painted, spurring a rise in philhellenism and helping to arouse sympathy in Britain and France for Greek independence. Amongst those early travellers and archaeologists were James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, who were commissioned by the Society of Dilettanti to survey the ruins of classical Athens. They produced the first measured drawings of the Parthenon, published in 1787 in the second volume of &quot;Antiquities of Athens Measured and Delineated&quot;.

From 1801 to 1812, agents of Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, removed about half the surviving Parthenon sculptures, sending them to Britain in efforts to establish a private museum. Elgin stated he removed the sculptures with permission of the Ottoman officials who exercised authority in Athens at the time. The legality of Elgin&#x27;s actions has been disputed.

=== War of Independence ===
During the Greek War of Independence (1821–1833) which ended the 355-year Ottoman rule of Athens, the Acropolis was besieged twice, first by the Greeks in 1821–22 and then by the Ottoman forces in 1826–27. During the first siege, the besieged Ottoman forces attempted to melt the lead in the columns of the Parthenon to cast bullets. During the second siege, the Parthenon was significantly damaged by Ottoman artillery fire.

===Independent Greece===
When independent Greece gained control of Athens in 1832, the visible section of the minaret was demolished; only its base and spiral staircase up to the level of the architrave remain intact. Soon all the medieval and Ottoman buildings on the Acropolis were destroyed. The image of the small mosque within the Parthenon&#x27;s cella has been preserved in Joly de Lotbinière&#x27;s photograph, published in Lerebours&#x27;s &quot;Excursions Daguerriennes&quot; in 1842: the first photograph of the Acropolis. The area became a historical precinct controlled by the Greek government. In the later 19th century, the Parthenon was widely considered by Americans and Europeans to be the pinnacle of human architectural achievement, and became a popular destination and subject of artists, including Frederic Edwin Church and Sanford Robinson Gifford. Today it attracts millions of tourists every year, who travel up the path at the western end of the Acropolis, through the restored Propylaea, and up the Panathenaic Way to the Parthenon, which is surrounded by a low fence to prevent damage.
===Dispute over the marbles===

The dispute centres around those of the Parthenon Marbles removed by Elgin, which are in the British Museum. A few sculptures from the Parthenon are also in the Louvre in Paris, in Copenhagen, and elsewhere, while more than half are in the Acropolis Museum in Athens. A few can still be seen on the building itself. In 1983, the Greek government formally asked the UK government to return the sculptures in the British Museum to Greece, and subsequently listed the dispute with UNESCO. The British Museum has consistently refused to return the sculptures, and successive British governments have been unwilling to force the museum to do so (which would require legislation). In 2021, UNESCO called upon the UK government to resolve the issue at the intergovernmental level. Discussions between UK and Greek officials are ongoing.

Four pieces of the sculptures have been repatriated to Greece: 3 from the Vatican, and 1 from a museum in Sicily.

==Restoration==

In 1981, an earthquake caused damage to the east façade. Air pollution and acid rain have damaged the marble and stonework.

An organized effort to preserve and restore buildings on the Acropolis began in 1975, when the Greek government established the Committee for the Conservation of the Acropolis Monuments (ESMA). That group of interdisciplinary specialist scholars oversees the academic understanding of the site to guide restoration efforts. The project later attracted funding and technical assistance from the European Union. An archaeological committee thoroughly documented every artefact remaining on the site, and architects assisted with computer models to determine their original locations. Particularly important and fragile sculptures were transferred to the Acropolis Museum.

A crane was installed for moving marble blocks; the crane was designed to fold away beneath the roofline when not in use. In some cases, prior re-constructions were found to be incorrect. These were dismantled, and a careful process of restoration began.

Originally, various blocks were held together by elongated iron H pins that were completely coated in lead, which protected the iron from corrosion. Stabilizing pins added in the 19th century were not lead-coated, and corroded. Since the corrosion product (rust) is expansive, the expansion caused further damage by cracking the marble.

The last remaining slabs from the western section of the Parthenon frieze were removed from the monument in 1993 for fear of further damage. They have now been transported to the new Acropolis Museum. Until cleaning of the remaining sculptures was completed in 2005, black crusts and coatings were present on the marble surface. Between 20 January and the end of March 2008, 4200 items (sculptures, inscriptions small terracotta objects), including some 80 artefacts dismantled from the monuments in recent years, were removed from the old museum on the Acropolis to the new Acropolis Museum. 

In 2019, Greece&#x27;s Central Archaeological Council approved a restoration of the interior cella&#x27;s north wall (along with parts of others). The project will reinstate as many as 360 ancient stones, and install 90 new pieces of Pentelic marble, minimizing the use of new material as much as possible. The eventual result of these restorations will be a partial restoration of some or most of each wall of the interior cella.

<text>Pachomius (; &quot;Pakhomios&quot;; ; c. 292 – 9 May 348 AD), also known as Saint Pachomius the Great, is generally recognized as the founder of Christian cenobitic monasticism. Coptic churches celebrate his feast day on 9 May, and Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches mark his feast on 15 May or 28 May. In Lutheranism, he is remembered as a renewer of the church, along with his contemporary (and fellow desert saint), Anthony of Egypt on 17 January.

==Name==
The name &quot;Pachomius&quot; is of Coptic origin: ⲡⲁϧⲱⲙ &quot;pakhōm&quot; from &quot;akhōm&quot; &quot;eagle or falcon&quot; (ⲡ &quot;p&quot;- at the beginning is the Coptic definite article), from Middle Egyptian &quot;falcon&quot;, originally &quot;divine image&quot;. Into Greek, it was adopted as Παχούμιος and Παχώμιος. By Greek folk etymology, it was sometimes interpreted as &quot;broad-shouldered&quot; from &quot;thick, large&quot; and &quot;shoulder&quot;.

==Life==
Pachomius was born in c. 292 in Thebaid (near modern-day Luxor, Egypt) to pagan parents. According to his hagiography, at age 21, Pachomius was swept up against his will in a Roman army recruitment drive, a common occurrence during this period of turmoil and civil war. With several other youths, he was put onto a ship that floated down the Nile and arrived at Thebes in the evening. Here he first encountered local Christians, who customarily brought food and comfort daily to the conscripted troops. This made a lasting impression, and Pachomius vowed to investigate Christianity further when he got out. He was able to leave the army without ever having to fight. He moved to the village of Sheneset (Chenoboskion) in Upper Egypt and was converted and baptized in 314.

Pachomius then came into contact with several well known ascetics and decided to pursue that path under the guidance of the hermit named Palaemon (317). One of his devotions, popular at the time, was praying with his arms stretched out in the form of a cross. After studying seven years with Palaemon, Pachomius set out to lead the life of a hermit near St. Anthony of Egypt, whose practices he imitated until Pachomius heard a voice in Tabennisi that told him to build a dwelling for the hermits to come to. An earlier ascetic named Macarius had created a number of proto-monasteries called lavra, or cells, where holy men who were physically or mentally unable to achieve the rigors of Anthony&#x27;s solitary life would live in a community setting. According to the &quot;Bohairic Life of Pachomius&quot; (17), while Pachomius was praying at the deserted village of Tabennisi, he heard a voice calling him, saying, &quot;Pachomius, Pachomius, struggle, dwell in this place and build a monastery; for many will come to you to become monks with you, and they will profit their souls.&quot; Later, while praying at night after a day of harvesting reeds with his brother on a small island, Pachomius had another vision of an angel saying to him three times, &quot;Pachomius, Pachomius, the Lord&#x27;s will is [for you] to minister to the race of men and to unite them to himself&quot; (&quot;Bohairic Life of Pachomius&quot; 22).

Pachomius established his first monastery between 318 and 323 at Tabennisi, Egypt. His elder brother John joined him, and soon more than 100 monks lived nearby. Pachomius set about organizing these cells into a formal organization. Until then, Christian asceticism had been solitary or &quot;eremitic&quot; with male or female monastics living in individual huts or caves and meeting only for occasional worship services. Pachomius created the community or &quot;cenobitic&quot; organization, in which male or female monastics lived together and held their property in common under the leadership of an abbot or abbess. Pachomius realized that some men, acquainted only with the eremitical life, might speedily become disgusted if the distracting cares of the cenobitical life were thrust too abruptly upon them. He therefore allowed them to devote their whole time to spiritual exercises, undertaking all the community&#x27;s administrative tasks himself. The community hailed Pachomius as &quot;Abba&quot; (&quot;father&quot; in Aramaic), from which &quot;Abbot&quot; derives.
The monastery at Tabennisi, though enlarged several times, soon became too small and a second was founded at Pbow. This monastery at Pbow would go on to become the center for monasteries springing up along the Nile in Upper Egypt. Both of these are believed to have initially been abandoned villages, which were then repurposed for Pachomius’ vision of his &quot;Koinonia&quot; (network of monasteries). After 336, Pachomius spent most of his time at Pbow. Though Pachomius sometimes acted as lector for nearby shepherds, neither he nor any of his monks became priests. St. Athanasius visited and wished to ordain him in 333, but Pachomius fled from him. Athanasius&#x27; visit was probably a result of Pachomius&#x27; zealous defence of orthodoxy against Arianism. Basil of Caesarea visited, then took many of Pachomius&#x27; ideas, which he adapted and implemented in Caesarea. This ascetic rule, or Ascetica, is still used today by the Eastern Orthodox Church, comparable to that of the Rule of St. Benedict in the West.

==Pachomian monasteries==
==Rule of St. Pachomius==
Pachomius was the first to set down a written monastic rule. The first rule was composed of prayers generally known and in general use, such as the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. The monks were to pray them every day. As the community developed, the rules were elaborated with precepts taken from the Bible. He drew up a rule which made things easier for the less proficient, but did not check the most extreme asceticism in the more proficient. The Rule sought to balance prayer with work, the communal life with solitude. The day was organised around the liturgy, with time for manual work and devotional reading.

Fasts and work were apportioned according to the individual&#x27;s strength. Each monk received the same food and clothing. Common meals were provided, but those who wished to absent themselves from them were encouraged to do so, and bread, salt, and water were placed in their cells. In the Pachomian monasteries it was left very much to the individual taste of each monk to fix the order of life for himself. Thus the hours for meals and the extent of his fasting were settled by him alone, he might eat with the others in common or have bread and salt provided in his own cell every day or every second day.

His rule was translated into Latin by Jerome. Honoratus of Lérins followed the Rule of St. Pachomius. Basil the Great and Benedict of Nursia adapted and incorporated parts of it in their rules.

==Death and legacy==
Pachomius continued as abbot to the cenobites for some thirty years. During an epidemic (probably plague), Pachomius called the monks, strengthened their faith, and failed to appoint his successor. Pachomius then died on 14 Pashons, 64 AM (9 May 348 AD).

By the time Pachomius died, eight monasteries and several hundred monks followed his guidance. Within a generation, cenobic practices spread from Egypt to Palestine and the Judean Desert, Syria, North Africa and eventually Western Europe. The number of monks, rather than the number of monasteries, may have reached 7000.

His reputation as a holy man has endured. As mentioned above, several liturgical calendars commemorate Pachomius. Among many miracles attributed to Pachomius, that though he had never learned the Greek or Latin tongues, he sometimes miraculously spoke them. Pachomius is also credited with being the first Christian to use and recommend use of a prayer rope.

<text>Philosophical Investigations () is a work by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, published posthumously in 1953. 

&quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; is divided into two parts, consisting of what Wittgenstein calls, in the preface, &quot;Bemerkungen&quot;, translated by G. E. M. Anscombe as &quot;remarks&quot;.

A survey among American university and college teachers ranked the &quot;Investigations&quot; as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy.
==Relation to Wittgenstein&#x27;s body of work==

In its preface, Wittgenstein says that &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; can be understood &quot;only by contrast with and against the background of my old way of thinking&quot;. That &quot;old way of thinking&quot; is to be found in the only book Wittgenstein published in his lifetime, the &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;. Many of the ideas developed in the &quot;Tractatus&quot; are criticised in the &quot;Investigations&quot;, while other ideas are further developed. 

The &quot;Blue and Brown Books&quot;, a set of notes dictated to his class at Cambridge in 1933–1934, contain the seeds of Wittgenstein&#x27;s later thoughts on language and are widely read as a turning point in his philosophy of language.

The American philosopher Norman Malcolm credits Piero Sraffa with breaking Wittgenstein&#x27;s hold of the notion that a proposition must literally be a picture of reality by means of a rude gesture from Sraffa, followed by Sraffa asking, &quot;What is the logical form of &quot;that&quot;?&quot; In the Introduction to the book written in 1945 Wittgenstein said Sraffa &quot;for many years unceasingly practiced on my thoughts. I am indebted to this stimulus for the most consequential ideas in this book&quot;.

==Themes==

=== Language-games ===
Wittgenstein develops this discussion of games into the key notion of a &quot;language-game&quot;. For Wittgenstein, his use of the term language-game &quot;is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a life-form.&quot; A central feature of language-games is that language is used in context and cannot be understood outside of that context. Wittgenstein lists the following as examples of language-games: &quot;Giving orders, and obeying them&quot;; &quot;describing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements&quot;; &quot;constructing an object from a description (a drawing)&quot;; &quot;reporting an event&quot;; &quot;speculating about an event&quot;. The famous example is the meaning of the word &quot;game&quot;. We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, and &quot;war games&quot;. These are all different uses of the word &quot;games&quot;. Wittgenstein also gives the example of &quot;Water!&quot;, which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game in which it is used. Another way Wittgenstein makes the point is that the word &quot;water&quot; has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as a code by members of a secret society.

Wittgenstein does not limit the application of his concept of language games to word meaning. He also applies it to sentence meaning. For example, the sentence &quot;Moses did not exist&quot; (§79) can mean various things. Wittgenstein argues that, independent of use, the sentence does not yet &#x27;say&#x27; anything. It is &#x27;meaningless&#x27; in the sense of not being significant for a particular purpose. It acquires significance only if we use it within a context; the sentence by itself does not determine its meaning but becomes meaningful only when it is used to say something. For instance, it can be used to say that no person or historical figure fits the descriptions attributed to the person who goes by the name of &quot;Moses&quot;. But it can also mean that the leader of the Israelites was not called Moses. Or that there cannot have been anyone who accomplished all that the Bible relates about Moses, etc. What the sentence means thus depends on its use in a context.

=== Meaning as use ===

The &quot;Investigations&quot; deal largely with the difficulties of language and meaning. Wittgenstein viewed the tools of language as being fundamentally simple , and he believed that philosophers had obscured this simplicity by misusing language and by asking meaningless questions. He attempted in the &quot;Investigations&quot; to make things clear: &quot;Der Fliege den Ausweg aus dem Fliegenglas zeigen&quot;—to show the fly the way out of the fly bottle.

Wittgenstein claims that the meaning of a word is based on how the word is understood within the language-game. A common summary of his argument is that meaning is use. According to the use theory of meaning, the words are not defined by reference to the objects they designate or by the mental representations one might associate with them, but by how they are used. For example, this means there is no need to postulate that there is something called &quot;good&quot; that exists independently of any good deed. Wittgenstein&#x27;s theory of meaning contrasts with Platonic realism and with Gottlob Frege&#x27;s notions of sense and reference. This argument has been labeled by some authors as &quot;anthropological holism&quot;.

Section 43 in Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; reads: &quot;For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word &quot;meaning,&quot; it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.&quot;

Wittgenstein begins &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; with a quote from Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot;, which represents the view that language serves to point out objects in the world and the view that he will be criticizing.The individual words in a language name objects—sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language, we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.
Wittgenstein rejects a variety of ways of thinking about what the meaning of a word is or how meanings can be identified. He shows how, in each case, the &quot;meaning&quot; of the word presupposes our ability to use it. He first asks the reader to perform a thought experiment: come up with a definition of the word &quot;game&quot;. While this may at first seem like a simple task, he then goes on to lead us through the problems with each of the possible definitions of the word &quot;game&quot;. Any definition that focuses on amusement leaves us unsatisfied since the feelings experienced by a world-class chess player are very different from those of a circle of children playing Duck Duck Goose. Any definition that focuses on competition will fail to explain the game of catch, or the game of solitaire. And a definition of the word &quot;game&quot; that focuses on rules will fall into similar difficulties.

The essential point of this exercise is often missed. Wittgenstein&#x27;s point is not that it is impossible to define &quot;game&quot;, but that &quot;even if we don&#x27;t have a definition, we can still use the word successfully&quot;. Everybody understands what we mean when we talk about playing a game, and we can even clearly identify and correct inaccurate uses of the word, all without reference to any definition that consists of necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept of a game. The German word for &quot;game&quot;, &quot;&quot;, has a different sense than in English; the meaning of &quot;Spiele&quot; also extends to the concept of &quot;play&quot; and &quot;playing.&quot; This German sense of the word may help readers better understand Wittgenstein&#x27;s context in his remarks regarding games.

Wittgenstein argues that definitions emerge from what he termed &quot;forms of life&quot;, roughly the culture and society in which they are used. Wittgenstein stresses the social aspects of cognition; to see how language works in most cases, we have to see how it functions in a specific social situation. It is this emphasis on becoming attentive to the social backdrop against which language is rendered intelligible that explains Wittgenstein&#x27;s elliptical comment that &quot;If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.&quot; However, in proposing the thought experiment involving the fictional character Robinson Crusoe, a captain shipwrecked on a desolate island with no other inhabitant, Wittgenstein shows that language is not in all cases a social phenomenon (although it is in most cases); instead, the criterion for a language is grounded in a set of interrelated normative activities: teaching, explanations, techniques, and criteria of correctness. In short, it is essential that a language be shareable, but this does not imply that for a language to function, it must be already shared.

Wittgenstein rejects the idea that ostensive definitions can provide us with the meaning of a word. For Wittgenstein, the thing that the word stands for does &quot;not&quot; give the meaning of the word. Wittgenstein argues for this by making a series of moves to show that understanding an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the way the word being defined is used. So, for instance, there is no difference between pointing to a piece of paper, to its colour, or to its shape, but understanding the difference is crucial to using the paper in an ostensive definition of a shape or of a colour.

===Family resemblances===

Why is it that we are sure a particular activity—e.g. Olympic target shooting—is a game while a similar activity—e.g. military sharp shooting—is not? Wittgenstein&#x27;s explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we&#x27;ve noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process—generally we don&#x27;t catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively &quot;see&quot; the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that the same is true of language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things that &quot;are games&quot; and enough things that &quot;are not games&quot; that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.

This brings us back to Wittgenstein&#x27;s reliance on indirect communication, and his reliance on thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren&#x27;t able to &quot;see&quot; family resemblances. We&#x27;ve made a mistake in understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein&#x27;s larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to &quot;see&quot; the family resemblances.

=== Rules and rule-following ===
Wittgenstein&#x27;s discussion of rules and rule-following ranges from § 138 through § 242. Wittgenstein begins his discussion of rules with the example of one person giving orders to another &quot;to write down a series of signs according to a certain formation rule.&quot; The series of signs consists of the natural numbers. Wittgenstein draws a distinction between following orders by copying the numbers following instruction and understanding the construction of the series of numbers. One general characteristic of games that Wittgenstein considers in detail is the way in which they consist in following rules. Rules constitute a family, rather than a class that can be explicitly defined. As a consequence, it is not possible to provide a definitive account of what it is to follow a rule. Indeed, he argues that &quot;any&quot; course of action can be made out to accord with some particular rule, and that therefore a rule cannot be used to explain an action. Rather, that one is following a rule or not is to be decided by looking to see if the actions conform to the expectations in the particular &quot;form of life&quot; in which one is involved. Following a rule is a social activity.

Saul Kripke provides an influential discussion of Wittgenstein&#x27;s remarks on rules. For Kripke, Wittgenstein&#x27;s discussion of rules &quot;may be regarded as a new form of philosophical scepticism.&quot; He starts his discussion of Wittgenstein by quoting what he describes as Wittgenstein&#x27;s sceptical paradox: &quot;This was our paradox: no course of action could be determined by a rule, because every course of action can be made out to accord with the rule. The answer was: if everything can be made out to accord with the rule, then it can also be made out to conflict with it. And so there would be neither accord nor conflict here.&quot; Kripke argues that the implications of Wittgenstein&#x27;s discussion of rules is that no person can mean something by the language that they use or correctly follow (or fail to follow) a rule. In his 1984 book, &quot;Wittgenstein on Meaning&quot;, Colin McGinn disputed Kripke&#x27;s interpretation.

===Private language===

Wittgenstein also ponders the possibility of a language that talks about those things that are known only to the user, whose content is inherently private. The usual example is that of a language in which one names one&#x27;s sensations and other subjective experiences, such that the meaning of the term is decided by the individual alone. For example, the individual names a particular sensation, on some occasion, &#x27;S&#x27;, and intends to use that word to refer to that sensation. Such a language Wittgenstein calls a &quot;private language&quot;.

Wittgenstein presents several perspectives on the topic. One point he makes is that it is incoherent to talk of &quot;knowing&quot; that one is in some particular mental state. Whereas others can learn of my pain, for example, I simply &quot;have&quot; my own pain; it follows that one does not &quot;know&quot; of one&#x27;s own pain, one simply &quot;has&quot; a pain. For Wittgenstein, this is a grammatical point, part of the way in which the language-game involving the word &quot;pain&quot; is played.

Although Wittgenstein certainly argues that the notion of private language is incoherent, because of the way in which the text is presented the exact nature of the argument is disputed. First, he argues that a private language is not really a language at all. This point is intimately connected with a variety of other themes in his later works, especially his investigations of &quot;meaning&quot;. For Wittgenstein, there is no single, coherent &quot;sample&quot; or &quot;object&quot; that we can call &quot;meaning&quot;. Rather, the supposition that there are such things is the source of many philosophical confusions. Meaning is a complicated phenomenon that is woven into the fabric of our lives. A good first approximation of Wittgenstein&#x27;s point is that meaning is a &quot;social&quot; event; meaning happens &quot;between&quot; language users. As a consequence, it makes no sense to talk about a private language, with words that &quot;mean&quot; something in the absence of other users of the language.

Wittgenstein also argues that one couldn&#x27;t possibly &quot;use&quot; the words of a private language. He invites the reader to consider a case in which someone decides that each time she has a particular sensation she will place a sign S in a diary. Wittgenstein points out that in such a case one could have no criteria for the correctness of one&#x27;s use of S. Again, several examples are considered. One is that perhaps using S involves mentally consulting a table of sensations, to check that one has associated S correctly; but in this case, how could the mental table be checked for its correctness? It is &quot;[a]s if someone were to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that what it said was true&quot;, as Wittgenstein puts it. One common interpretation of the argument is that while one may have direct or privileged access to one&#x27;s &quot;current&quot; mental states, there is no such infallible access to identifying previous mental states that one had in the past. That is, the only way to check to see if one has applied the symbol S correctly to a certain mental state is to introspect and determine whether the current sensation is identical to the sensation previously associated with S. And while identifying one&#x27;s current mental state of remembering may be infallible, whether one remembered correctly is not infallible. Thus, for a language to be used at all it must have some public criterion of identity. 

Often, what is widely regarded as a deep philosophical problem will vanish, argues Wittgenstein, and eventually be seen as a confusion about the significance of the words that philosophers use to frame such problems and questions. It is only in this way that it is interesting to talk about something like a &quot;private language&quot; — i.e., it is helpful to see how the &quot;problem&quot; results from a misunderstanding.

To sum up: Wittgenstein asserts that, if something is a language, it &quot;cannot&quot; be (logically) private; and if something &quot;is&quot; private, it is not (and cannot be) a language.

===Wittgenstein&#x27;s beetle===
Another point that Wittgenstein makes against the possibility of a private language involves the beetle-in-a-box thought experiment. He asks the reader to imagine that each person has a box, inside which is something that everyone intends to refer to with the word &quot;beetle&quot;. Further, suppose that no one can look inside another&#x27;s box, and each claims to know what a &quot;beetle&quot; is only by examining their own box. Wittgenstein suggests that, in such a situation, the word &quot;beetle&quot; could not be the name of a thing, because supposing that each person has something completely different in their boxes (or nothing at all) does not change the meaning of the word; the beetle as a private object &quot;drops out of consideration as irrelevant&quot;. Thus, Wittgenstein argues, if we can talk about something, then it is not &quot;private&quot;, in the sense considered. And, contrapositively, if we consider something to be indeed private, it follows that we &quot;cannot talk about it&quot;.

===Mind===
Wittgenstein&#x27;s investigations of language lead to several issues concerning the mind. His key target of criticism is any form of extreme mentalism that posits mental states that are entirely unconnected to the subject&#x27;s environment. For Wittgenstein, thought is inevitably tied to language, which is inherently social. Part of Wittgenstein&#x27;s credo is captured in the following proclamation: &quot;An &#x27;inner process&#x27; stands in need of outward criteria.&quot; This follows primarily from his conclusions about private languages: a private mental state (a sensation of pain, for example) cannot be adequately discussed without public criteria for identifying it.

According to Wittgenstein, those who insist that consciousness (or any other apparently subjective mental state) is conceptually unconnected to the external world are mistaken. Wittgenstein explicitly criticizes so-called conceivability arguments: &quot;Could one imagine a stone&#x27;s having consciousness? And if anyone can do so—why should that not merely prove that such image-mongery is of no interest to us?&quot; He considers and rejects the following reply as well:

&quot;But if I suppose that someone is in pain, then I am simply supposing that he has just the same as I have so often had.&quot; — That gets us no further. It is as if I were to say: &quot;You surely know what &#x27;It is 5 o&#x27;clock here&#x27; means; so you also know what &#x27;It&#x27;s 5 o&#x27;clock on the sun&#x27; means. It means simply that it is just the same there as it is here when it is 5 o&#x27;clock.&quot; — The explanation by means of &quot;identity&quot; does not work here.

Thus, according to Wittgenstein, mental states are intimately connected to a subject&#x27;s environment, especially to his or her linguistic environment, and conceivability or imaginability. Arguments that claim otherwise are misguided.

===&quot;Seeing that&quot; vs. &quot;seeing as&quot;===

In addition to ambiguous sentences, Wittgenstein discussed figures that can be seen and understood in two different ways. Often one can see something in a straightforward way — seeing &quot;that&quot; it is a rabbit, perhaps. But, at other times, one notices a particular aspect — seeing it &quot;as&quot; something.

An example Wittgenstein uses is the &quot;duck-rabbit&quot;, an ambiguous image that can be &quot;seen as&quot; either a duck or a rabbit. When one looks at the duck-rabbit and sees a rabbit, one is not &quot;interpreting&quot; the picture as a rabbit, but rather &quot;reporting&quot; what one sees. One just sees the picture as a rabbit. But what occurs when one sees it first as a duck, then as a rabbit? As the gnomic remarks in the &quot;Investigations&quot; indicate, Wittgenstein isn&#x27;t sure. However, he is sure that it could not be the case that the external world stays the same while an &quot;internal&quot; cognitive change takes place.

== Response and influence ==
In a 1999 poll of philosophers by the journal &quot;Philosophical Forum&quot;, the &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; was the most named work in response to the prompt to name the top five most important books in 20th century philosophy.

Bertrand Russell in his book &quot;My Philosophical Development&quot;, wrote that &quot;I have not found in Wittgenstein&#x27;s Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages&quot;.

In his book &quot;Words and Things&quot;, Ernest Gellner was fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal &quot;Mind&quot; (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.

The first English translation of Karl Rahner&#x27;s &quot;Schriften zur Theologie&quot; was named &quot;Theological Investigations&quot;, this title choice was by translator and former student of Wittgenstein, the theologian Cornelius Ernst, as a homage to the book.

Besides stressing the differences between the &quot;Investigations&quot; and the &quot;Tractatus&quot;, some critical approaches have claimed there to be more continuity and similarity between the two works than many suppose. One of these is the New Wittgenstein approach.
===Kripkenstein===
The discussion of private languages was revitalized in 1982 with the publication of Kripke&#x27;s book &quot;Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language&quot;. In this work, Kripke uses Wittgenstein&#x27;s text to develop a particular type of skepticism about rules that stresses the &quot;communal&quot; nature of language-use as grounding meaning. Critics of Kripke&#x27;s version of Wittgenstein have facetiously referred to it as &quot;Kripkenstein,&quot; scholars such as Gordon Baker, Peter Hacker, Colin McGinn, and John McDowell seeing it as a radical misinterpretation of Wittgenstein&#x27;s text. Other philosophers – such as Martin Kusch – have defended Kripke&#x27;s views.

===Popular culture===
The album, &quot;The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast&quot; and it&#x27;s title track &quot;Roses and Teeth for Ludwig Wittgenstein&quot;, by electronic duo Matmos is named after a quote from the book. Steve Reich&#x27;s song, &quot;You Are (Variations)&quot;, also contain a quote from the book: &quot;Explanations come to an end somewhere&quot;.

== Editions ==
&quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; was not ready for publication when Wittgenstein died in 1951. G. E. M. Anscombe translated Wittgenstein&#x27;s manuscript into English, and it was first published in 1953. There are multiple editions of &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; with the popular third edition and 50th anniversary edition having been edited by Anscombe: 
*First Edition: Blackwell Publishers 1953. () German-English Edition, translation by G. E. M. Anscombe.
*Second Edition: Blackwell Publishers, 1958.
*Third Edition: Prentice Hall, 1973 (). 
*50th Anniversary Edition: Blackwell Publishers, 2001 (). This edition includes the original German text in addition to the English translation.
*Fourth Edition: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009 (). This edition includes the original German text in addition to the English translation.

<text>Poul William Anderson (November 25, 1926 – July 31, 2001) was an American fantasy and science fiction author who was active from the 1940s until his death in 2001. Anderson also wrote historical novels. He won the Hugo Award seven times and the Nebula Award three times, and was nominated many more times for awards.

== Biography ==

Poul Anderson was born on November 25, 1926, in Bristol, Pennsylvania to Danish parents. Soon after his birth, his father, Anton Anderson, relocated the family to Texas, where they lived for more than ten years. After Anton Anderson&#x27;s death, his widow took the children to Denmark. The family returned to the United States after the beginning of World War II, settling eventually on a Minnesota farm.

While he was an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota, Anderson&#x27;s first stories were published by editor John W. Campbell in the magazine &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;: &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Children&quot; by Anderson and F. N. Waldrop in March 1947 and a sequel, &quot;Chain of Logic&quot; by Anderson alone, in July. He earned his BA in physics with honors but became a freelance writer after he graduated in 1948. His third story was printed in the December &quot;Astounding&quot;.

Anderson married Karen Kruse in 1953 and relocated with her to the San Francisco Bay area. Their daughter Astrid (later married to science fiction author Greg Bear) was born in 1954. They made their home in Orinda, California. Over the years Poul gave many readings at The Other Change of Hobbit bookstore in Berkeley; his widow later donated his typewriter and desk to the store.

In 1954, he published the fantasy novel &quot;The Broken Sword&quot;, one of his best-known works.

In 1965, Algis Budrys said that Anderson &quot;has for some time been science fiction&#x27;s best storyteller&quot;. He was a founding member of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) in 1966 and of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers&#x27; Guild of America (SAGA), also during the mid-1960s. The latter was a group of Heroic fantasy authors organized by Lin Carter, originally eight in number, with entry by credentials as a fantasy writer alone. Anderson was the sixth President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, taking office in 1972.

Robert A. Heinlein dedicated his 1985 novel &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; to Anderson and eight of the other members of the Citizens&#x27; Advisory Council on National Space Policy.

The Science Fiction Writers of America made Anderson its 16th SFWA Grand Master in 1998. In 2000&#x27;s fifth class, he was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame as one of two deceased and two living writers.

He died of prostate cancer on July 31, 2001, after a month in the hospital. A few of his novels were first published posthumously.
