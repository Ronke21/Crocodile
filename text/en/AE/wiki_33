<text>A massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) is a video game that combines aspects of a role-playing video game and a massively multiplayer online game.

As in role-playing games (RPGs), the player assumes the role of a character (often in a fantasy world or science-fiction world) and takes control over many of that character&#x27;s actions. MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player online RPGs by the number of players able to interact together, and by the game&#x27;s persistent world (usually hosted by the game&#x27;s publisher), which continues to exist and evolve while the player is offline and away from the game.

MMORPGs are played throughout the world. Global revenues for MMORPGs exceeded half a billion dollars in 2005, and the western world&#x27;s revenues exceeded a billion dollars in 2006. In 2008, the spending on subscription MMORPGs by consumers in North America and Europe grew to $1.4 billion. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, a popular MMORPG, had over 10 million subscribers as of November 2014. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;″s total revenue was $1.04 billion US dollars in 2014. &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;, released in 2011, became the world&#x27;s &quot;fastest-growing subscription MMO in history&quot; after gaining more than 1 million players within the first three days of its launch.
==Common features==
Although modern MMORPGs sometimes differ dramatically from their predecessors, many of them share the same basic characteristics. These include several common features:
*persistent game environment
*some form of level progression
*social interaction within the game
*in-game culture
*membership in a group
*character customization.

===Themes===
The majority of popular MMORPGs are based on traditional fantasy themes, often occurring in an in-game universe comparable to that of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Some employ hybrid themes that either merge or replace fantasy elements with those of science fiction, sword and sorcery, or crime fiction. Others draw thematic material from American comic books, the occult, and other genres. These elements are often developed using similar tasks and scenarios involving quests, monsters, and loot.

===Progression===
In nearly all MMORPGs, the development of the player&#x27;s character is the primary goal. Nearly all MMORPGs feature a character progression system, in which players earn experience points for their actions and use those points to reach character &quot;levels&quot;, which makes them better at whatever they do. Traditionally, combat with monsters and completing quests for non-player characters, either alone or in groups, are the primary ways to earn experience points. The accumulation of wealth (including combat-useful items) is also a way to progress in many MMORPGs. This is traditionally best accomplished via combat. The cycle produced by these conditions, combat leading to new items allowing for more combat with no change in gameplay, is sometimes pejoratively referred to as the level treadmill, or &quot;grinding&quot;. The role-playing game &quot;Progress Quest&quot; was created as a parody of this trend. &quot;Eve Online&quot;, a space-based MMORPG, uses an alternative method of progression where users train skills in real-time rather than using experience points as a measure of progression.

In some MMORPGs, there is no limit to a player&#x27;s level, allowing the grinding experience to continue indefinitely. MMORPGs that use this model often glorify top ranked players by displaying their avatars on the game&#x27;s website or posting their stats on a high score screen. Another common practice is to enforce a maximum reachable level for all players, often referred to as a level cap. Once reached, the definition of a player&#x27;s progression changes. Instead of being awarded primarily with experience for completing quests and dungeons, the player&#x27;s motivation to continue playing will be replaced with collecting money and equipment.

Often, the widened range of equipment available at the maximum level will have increased aesthetic value to distinguish high ranking players in game between lower ranked players. Colloquially known as endgame gear, this set of empowered weapons and armor adds a competitive edge to both scripted boss encounters as well as player vs player combat. Player motivation to outperform others is fueled by acquiring such items and is a significant determining factor in their success or failure in combat-related situations.

===Social interaction===
MMORPGs almost always have tools to facilitate communication between players. Many MMORPGs offer support for in-game guilds or clans, though these will usually form whether the game supports them or not.

In addition, most MMOGs require some degree of teamwork in parts of the game. These tasks usually require players to take on roles in the group, such as protecting other players from damage (called tanking), &quot;healing&quot; damage done to other players or damaging enemies.

MMORPGs generally have Game Moderators or Game Masters (frequently referred to as GMs or &quot;mods&quot;), who may be paid employees or unpaid volunteers who attempt to supervise the world. Some GMs may have additional access to features and information related to the game that are not available to other players and roles.

Relationships formed in MMORPGs can often be just as intense as relationships formed between friends or partners met outside the game, and often involve elements of collaboration and trust between players.

===Roleplaying===
Most MMORPGs provide different types of classes that players can choose. Among those classes, a small portion of players choose to roleplay their characters, and there are rules that provide functionality and content to those who do. Community resources such as forums and guides exist in support of this play style.

For example, if a player wants to play a priest role in his MMORPG world, that player might buy a cope from a shop and learn priestly skills, proceeding to speak, act, and interact with others as their character would. This may or may not include pursuing other goals such as wealth or experience. Guilds or similar groups with a focus on roleplaying may develop extended in-depth narratives using the setting and resources similar to those in the game world.

===Culture===
Over time, the MMORPG community has developed a sub-culture with its own slang and metaphors, as well as an unwritten list of social rules and taboos. Players will often complain about &#x27;grind&#x27; (a slang term for any repetitive, time-consuming activity in an MMORPG), or talk about &#x27;buffs&#x27; and &#x27;nerfs&#x27; (respectively an upgrade or downgrade of a particular game mechanic).

As with all such cultures, social rules exist for such things as invitations to join an adventuring party, the proper division of treasure, and how a player is expected to behave while grouped with other players.

===System architecture===
Most MMORPGs are deployed using a client–server system architecture. The server software generates a persistent instance of the virtual world that runs continuously, and players connect to it via a client software. The client software may provide access to the entire playing world, or further &#x27;expansions&#x27; may be required to be purchased to allow access to certain areas of the game. &quot;EverQuest&quot; and &quot;Guild Wars&quot; are two examples of games that use such a format. Players generally must purchase the client software for a one-time fee, although an increasing trend is for MMORPGs to work using pre-existing &quot;thin&quot; clients, such as a web browser.

Depending on the number of players and the system architecture, an MMORPG might be run on multiple separate servers, each representing an independent world, where players from one server cannot interact with those from another; &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; is a prominent example, with each separate server housing several thousand players. In many MMORPGs the number of players in one world is often limited to around a few thousand, but a notable example of the opposite is &quot;EVE Online&quot;, which accommodates several hundred thousand players on the same server, with over 60,000 playing simultaneously (June 2010) at certain times. Some games allow characters to appear on any world, but not simultaneously (such as &quot;Seal Online: Evolution&quot; or Kolossium competition in &quot;Dofus&quot;); others limit each character to the world in which it was created. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; has experimented with &quot;cross-realm&quot; (i.e. cross-server) interaction in player vs player &quot;battlegrounds&quot;, using server clusters or &quot;battlegroups&quot; to co-ordinate players looking to participate in structured player vs player content such as the Warsong Gulch or Alterac Valley battlegrounds. Additionally, patch 3.3, released on December 8, 2009, introduced a cross-realm &quot;looking for group&quot; system to help players form groups for instanced content (though not for open-world questing) from a larger pool of characters than their home server can necessarily provide.

=== Business models ===

MMORPGs today use a wide range of business models, from free of charge, free with microtransactions, advertise funded, to various kinds of payment plans. Some MMORPGs require payment or a monthly subscription to play. By definition, &quot;massively multiplayer&quot; games are always online, and most require some sort of continuous revenue (such as monthly subscriptions and advertisements) for maintenance and development purposes. Some games, such as &quot;Guild Wars&quot;, have disposed of the &#x27;monthly fee&#x27; model entirely, and recover costs directly through sales of the software and associated expansion packs. Still others adopt a micropayment model where the core content is free, but players are given the option to purchase additional content, such as equipment, aesthetic items, or pets. Games that make use of this model often have originated in Korea, such as &quot;Flyff&quot; and &quot;MapleStory&quot;. This business model is alternately called &quot;pay for perks&quot; or &quot;freemium&quot;, and games using it often describe themselves with the term &quot;free-to-play&quot;.

*Free-to-play (F2P) means that there is no cost to purchase the software and there is no subscription charge. Variably applies to traditionally bought and forever available games (see Buy-to-play below). Most newer MMOs that fall under this category now includes microtransactions however, which causes them to overlap with the Freemium model.
*Freemium (a portmanteau of &quot;free-to-play&quot; and &quot;premium&quot;) means that the majority or all of the game&#x27;s content is available for free but players can pay for extra content, character customization, added perks or faster advancement into the game via microtransactions. Freemium thus overlaps with both the free-to-play and pay-to-play models.
*Buy-to-play (B2P) means that the MMO can only be played by purchasing the game, but there is no subsequent subscription fee for playing the game. These games may or may not include additional microtransactions, or may sell additional content in the form of expansions instead of asking for an ongoing subscription fee.
*Pay-to-play (P2P) means that the MMO requires a monthly subscription fee or other ongoing fee in order to continue playing the game. It may also require an up-front purchase of the game in addition to the monthly subscription fee, though many of these up-front purchases include a month of game time. This was once the most common way for MMOs to finance themselves, but has fallen out of favor in recent years as an increasing number of games have switched to other business models due to difficulty in retaining a stable playerbase.

==History==
MMORPG is a term coined by Richard Garriott to refer to massive multiplayer online role-playing games and their social communities. Previous to this and related coinages, these games were generally called graphical MUDs; the history of MMORPGs traces back directly through the MUD genre. Through this connection, MMORPGs can be seen to have roots in the earliest multi-user games such as &quot;Mazewar&quot; (1974) and &quot;MUD1&quot; (1978). 1985 saw the release of a roguelike (pseudo-graphical) MUD called &quot;Island of Kesmai&quot; on CompuServe and Lucasfilm&#x27;s graphical MUD Habitat. The first fully graphical multi-user RPG was &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, which was delivered through America Online in 1991 and was personally championed by AOL President Steve Case. Other early proprietary graphical online RPGs include three on The Sierra Network: &quot;The Shadow of Yserbius&quot; in 1992, &quot;The Fates of Twinion&quot; in 1993, and &quot;The Ruins of Cawdor&quot; in 1995. Another milestone came in 1995 as NSFNET restrictions were lifted, opening the Internet up for game developers, which allowed for the first truly &quot;massively&quot;-scoped titles. Finally, MMORPGs as defined today began with &quot;Meridian 59&quot; in 1996, innovative both in its scope and in offering first-person 3D graphics, with &quot;The Realm Online&quot; appearing nearly simultaneously. &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, released in 1997, is often credited with first popularizing the genre, though more mainstream attention was garnered by 1999&#x27;s &quot;EverQuest&quot; and &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot; in the West and 1996&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in South Korea.

The financial success of these early titles has ensured competition in the genre since that time. MMORPG titles now exist on consoles and in new settings. In 2008, the market for MMORPGs had Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; dominating as the largest MMORPG, alongside other titles such as &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; and &quot;Guild Wars 2&quot;, though an additional market exists for free-to-play MMORPGs, which are supported by advertising and purchases of in-game items. This free-to-play model is particularly common in South Korea such as &quot;MapleStory&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Atlantica Online&quot; and &quot;Lost Ark&quot;. Also, there are some free-to-play games, such as &quot;RuneScape&quot; and &quot;Tibia&quot;, where the game is free, but one would have to pay monthly to play the game with more features. &quot;Guild Wars&quot; and its sequel avoid some degree of competition with other MMORPGs by only requiring the initial purchase of the game to play.

==Development==
The cost of developing a competitive commercial MMORPG title often exceeded $10 million in 2003. These projects require multiple disciplines within game design and development such as 3D modeling, 2D art, animation, user interfaces, client/server engineering, database architecture, and network infrastructure.

The front-end (or client) component of a commercial, modern MMORPG features 3D graphics. As with other modern 3D games, the front-end requires expertise with implementing 3D engines, real-time shader techniques and physics simulation. The actual visual content (areas, creatures, characters, weapons, spaceships and so forth) is developed by artists who typically begin with two-dimensional concept art, and later convert these concepts into animated 3D scenes, models and texture maps.

Developing an MMOG server requires expertise with client/server architecture, network protocols, security, and database design. MMORPGs include reliable systems for a number of vital tasks. The server must be able to handle and verify a large number of connections, prevent cheating, and apply changes (bug fixes or added content) to the game. A system for recording the games data at regular intervals, without stopping the game, is also important.

Maintenance requires sufficient servers and bandwidth, and a dedicated support staff. Insufficient resources for maintenance lead to lag and frustration for the players, and can severely damage the reputation of a game, especially at launch. Care must also be taken to ensure that player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing servers. Peer-to-peer MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth, CPU-hungry rendering engines, unreliability of individual nodes, and inherent lack of security (opening fertile new grounds for cheating) can make them a difficult proposition. The hosted infrastructure for a commercial-grade MMORPG requires the deployment of hundreds (or even thousands) of servers. Developing an affordable infrastructure for an online game requires developers to scale large numbers of players with less hardware and network investment.

In addition, the development team will need to have expertise with the fundamentals of game design: world-building, lore and game mechanics, as well as what makes games fun.

===Non-corporate development===

Though the vast majority of MMORPGs are produced by companies, many small teams of programmers and artists have contributed to the genre. As shown above, the average MMORPG development project requires enormous investments of time and money, and running the game can be a long-term commitment. As a result, non-corporate (or independent, or &quot;indie&quot;) development of MMORPGs is less common compared to other genres. Still, many independent MMORPGs do exist, representing a wide spectrum of genres, gameplay types, and revenue systems.
Some independent MMORPG projects are completely open source, while others feature proprietary content made with an open-source game engine. The WorldForge project has been active since 1998 and formed a community of independent developers who are working on creating framework for a number of open-source MMORPGs. The Multiverse Foundation has also created a platform specifically for independent MMOG developers.

==Trends==
As there are a number of wildly different titles within the genre, and since the genre develops so rapidly, it is difficult to definitively state that the genre is heading in one direction or another. Still, there are a few obvious developments. One of these developments is the raid group quest, or &quot;raid&quot;, which is an adventure designed for large groups of players (often twenty or more).

===Instance dungeons===
Instance dungeons, sometimes shortened to &quot;instances&quot;, are game areas that are &quot;copied&quot; for individual players or groups, which keeps those in the instance separated from the rest of the game world. This reduces competition, and also reducing the amount of data that needs to be sent to and from the server, reducing lag. &quot;The Realm Online&quot; was the first MMORPG to begin to use a rudimentary form of this technique and &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; would develop it further, using instances as a key element of gameplay. Since then, instancing has become increasingly common. The &quot;raids&quot;, as mentioned above, often involve instance dungeons. Examples of games which feature instances are &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot;, &quot;EverQuest&quot;, &quot;EverQuest II&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, &quot;Guild Wars&quot;, &quot;Rift&quot;, &quot;RuneScape&quot;, &quot;Star Trek Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic,&quot; and &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;.

===Player-created content===
Increased amounts of &quot;player-created content&quot; is another trend.

===Use of licenses===
The use of intellectual property licensing common in other video game genres has also appeared in MMORPGs. 2007 saw the release of &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot;, based on J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. Other licensed MMORPGs include &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;, based on the &quot;Matrix&quot; trilogy of films, &quot;Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning&quot;, based on Games Workshop&#x27;s table top game, &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;, &quot;Star Wars The Old Republic&quot;, &quot;Champions Online&quot; and &quot;Age of Conan&quot;.

Additionally, several licenses from television have been optioned for MMORPGs, for example &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; and &quot;Stargate Worlds&quot; (which was later canceled).

===Console-based MMORPGs===
The first console-based MMORPG was &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; for the Dreamcast. The first console-based open-world MMORPG was &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; for the PlayStation 2.
&quot;EverQuest Online Adventures&quot;, also on the PlayStation 2, was the first console MMORPG in North America.
Although console-based MMORPGs are considered more difficult to produce, the platform is gaining more attention.

===Browser-based MMORPGs===
With the popularization of Facebook and microtransactions came a wave of Flash and HTML5 based MMORPGs that use the free to play model. They require no download outside of a browser and usually have heavily integrated social media sharing features.

===Smartphone-based MMORPGs===
Smartphones with their GPS capabilities (amongst others) enable augmented reality in games such as &quot;Ingress&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;. The games are enhanced by location and distance based tracking, bench marking goals or facilitating trade between players.

==In society and culture==

===Psychological effects===

Since the interactions between MMORPG players are real, even if the environments are virtual, psychologists and sociologists are able to use MMORPGs as tools for academic research. Sherry Turkle has found that many people have expanded their emotional range by exploring the many different roles (including gender identities) that MMORPGs allow a person to explore.

Nick Yee has surveyed more than 35,000 MMORPG players over the past several years, focusing on psychological and sociological aspects of these games. Recent findings included that 15% of players become a guild-leader at one time or another, but most generally find the job tough and thankless; and that players spend a considerable amount of time (often a third of their total time investment) doing things that are external to gameplay but part of the metagame.

Many players report that the emotions they feel while playing an MMORPG are very strong, to the extent that 8.7% of male and 23.2% of female players in a statistical study have had an online wedding. Other researchers have found that the enjoyment of a game is directly related to the social organization of a game, ranging from brief encounters between players to highly organized play in structured groups.

In a study by Zaheer Hussain and Mark D. Griffiths, it was found that just over one in five gamers (21%) said they preferred socializing online to offline. Significantly more male gamers than female gamers said that they found it easier to converse online than offline. It was also found that 57% of gamers had created a character of the opposite gender, and it is suggested that the online female persona has a number of positive social attributes.

A German fMRT-study conducted by researchers of the Central Institute of Mental Health points towards impairments in social, emotional and physical aspects of the self-concept and a higher degree in avatar identification in addicted MMORPG players, compared to non-addicted and naive (nonexperienced) people. These findings generally support Davis&#x27; cognitive behavioral model of Internet addiction, which postulates that dysfunctional self-related cognitions represent central factors contributing towards the development and maintenance of MMORPG addiction. The high degree of avatar identification found by Leménager et al. in the addicted group of this study indicates that MMORPG playing may represent an attempt to compensate for impairments in self-concept. Psychotherapeutic interventions should therefore focus on the development of coping strategies for real-life situations in which addicted players tend to experience themselves as incompetent and inferior.

Richard Bartle, author of &quot;Designing Virtual Worlds&quot;, classified multiplayer RPG-players into four primary psychological groups. His classifications were then expanded upon by Erwin Andreasen, who developed the concept into the thirty-question Bartle Test that helps players determine which category they are associated with. With over 650,000 test responses as of 2011, this is perhaps the largest ongoing survey of multiplayer game players. Based on Bartle and Yee&#x27;s research, Jon Radoff has published an updated model of player motivation that focuses on immersion, competition, cooperation and achievement. These elements may be found not only in MMORPGs, but many other types of games and within the emerging field of gamification.

There have been numerous discussions and evaluations by various scholarly institutions regarding the long-term effects of video game overuse. Many news agencies have criticized video games as promoting violent tendencies in its player base and encouraging anti-social behaviors. Ultimately this culminated in the World Health Organization classifying the overuse of video games as &quot;Technological Addiction&quot; in May 2019.

=== Disease research ===
In &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, a temporary design glitch attracted the attention of psychologists and epidemiologists across North America, when the &quot;Corrupted Blood&quot; disease of a monster began to spread unintentionally—and uncontrollably—into the wider game world. The Centers for Disease Control intended to use the incident as a research model to chart both the progression of a disease, and the potential human response to large-scale epidemic infection. However, due to Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s failure to keep statistical records of the event, the 2005 Corrupted Blood Outbreak ultimately failed to produce any results. Nevertheless, the CDC has continued to express interest in the use of MMORPGs for disease research.

=== Education ===
It has been suggested by Springer University in Germany that MMORPGs encourage and provide opportunities to study and improve in economic theory by providing a controlled environment for the natural development of economic practices between players of including professions, trade, and services.

Research has shown that for the positive learner, game-based interaction could reduce inhibition as well as enhance the enjoyment and motivation of second language learning, but appears to be more suitable for learners of intermediate and higher levels of proficiency than language beginners.

=== Therapeutic applications ===
The Division of Autism and developmental disabilities published a significant report detailing the value of MMORPGs for the treatment of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The report suggests that individuals with autism spectrum disorder could benefit from MMORPGs by being provided a space to freely develop social skills and communication skills without the stress of face-to-face contact. This in turn opens new pathways for social therapy for individuals with developmental disabilities.

===Economics===

Many MMORPGs feature living economies. Virtual items and currency have to be gained through play and have definite value for players. Such a virtual economy can be analyzed (using data logged by the game) and has value in economic research. More significantly, these &quot;virtual&quot; economies can affect the economies of the real world.

One of the early researchers of MMORPGs was Edward Castronova, who demonstrated that a supply-and-demand market exists for virtual items and that it crosses over with the real world. This crossover has some requirements of the game:
* The ability for players to sell an item to each other for in-game (virtual) currency.
* Bartering for items between players for items of similar value.
* The purchase of in-game items for real-world currency.
* Exchanges of real-world currencies for virtual currencies.
* The invention of user-created meta-currencies such as Dragon kill points to distribute in-game rewards.

The idea of attaching real-world value to &quot;virtual&quot; items has had a profound effect on players and the game industry, and even the courts. The virtual currency selling pioneer IGE received a lawsuit from a &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; player for interfering in the economics and intended use of the game by selling WoW gold. Castronova&#x27;s first study in 2002 found that a highly liquid (if illegal) currency market existed, with the value of &quot;Everquest&quot;&#x27;s in-game currency exceeding that of the Japanese yen. Some people even make a living by working these virtual economies; these people are often referred to as gold farmers, and may be employed in game sweatshops.

Game publishers usually prohibit the exchange of real-world money for virtual goods, but others actively promote the idea of linking (and directly profiting from) an exchange. In &quot;Second Life&quot; and &quot;Entropia Universe&quot;, the virtual economy and the real-world economy are directly linked. This means that real money can be deposited for game money and vice versa. Real-world items have also been sold for game money in &quot;Entropia&quot;, and some players of &quot;Second Life&quot; have generated revenues in excess of $100,000.

Some of the issues confronting online economies include:
* The use of &quot;bots&quot; or automated programs, that assist some players in accumulating in-game wealth to the disadvantage of other players.
* The use of unsanctioned auction sites, which has led publishers to seek legal remedies to prevent their use based on intellectual-property claims.
* The emergence of virtual crime, which can take the form of both fraud against the player or publisher of an online game, and even real-life acts of violence stemming from in-game transactions.

Linking real-world and virtual economies was rare in MMORPGs as of 2008, as it is generally believed to be detrimental to gameplay. If real-world wealth can be used to obtain greater, more immediate rewards than skillful gameplay, the incentive for strategic roleplay and real game involvement is diminished. It could also easily lead to a skewed hierarchy where richer players gain better items, allowing them to take on stronger opponents and level up more quickly than less wealthy but more committed players.

<text>Multiplication (often denoted by the cross symbol, ×, by the mid-line dot operator, ·, by juxtaposition, or, on computers, by an asterisk, *) is one of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic, with the other ones being addition, subtraction, and division. The result of a multiplication operation is called a &quot;product&quot;.

The multiplication of whole numbers may be thought of as repeated addition; that is, the multiplication of two numbers is equivalent to adding as many copies of one of them, the multiplicand, as the quantity of the other one, the multiplier; both numbers can be referred to as factors.
:formula_1

For example, the expression formula_2, phrased as &quot;3 times 4&quot; or &quot;3 multiplied by 4&quot;, can be evaluated by adding 3 copies of 4 together:
:formula_3
Here, 3 (the &quot;multiplier&quot;) and 4 (the &quot;multiplicand&quot;) are the &quot;factors&quot;, and 12 is the &quot;product&quot;.

One of the main properties of multiplication is the commutative property, which states in this case that adding 3 copies of 4 gives the same result as adding 4 copies of 3:
:formula_4

Thus, the designation of multiplier and multiplicand does not affect the result of the multiplication.
Systematic generalizations of this basic definition define the multiplication of integers (including negative numbers), rational numbers (fractions), and real numbers.

Multiplication can also be visualized as counting objects arranged in a rectangle (for whole numbers) or as finding the area of a rectangle whose sides have some given lengths. The area of a rectangle does not depend on which side is measured first—a consequence of the commutative property.

The product of two measurements (or physical quantities) is a new type of measurement (or new quantity), usually with a derived unit of measurement. For example, multiplying the lengths (in meters or feet) of the two sides of a rectangle gives its area (in square meters or square feet). Such a product is the subject of dimensional analysis.

The inverse operation of multiplication is &quot;division&quot;. For example, since 4 multiplied by 3 equals 12, 12 divided by 3 equals 4. Indeed, multiplication by 3, followed by division by 3, yields the original number. The division of a number other than 0 by itself equals 1.

Several mathematical concepts expand upon the fundamental idea of multiplication. The product of a sequence, vector multiplication, complex numbers, and matrices are all examples where this can be seen. These more advanced constructs tend to affect the basic properties in their own ways, such as becoming noncommutative in matrices and some forms of vector multiplication or changing the sign of complex numbers.

==Notation==

In arithmetic, multiplication is often written using the multiplication sign (either or ) between the terms (that is, in infix notation). For example,
:formula_5 (&quot;two times three equals six&quot;)
:formula_6
:formula_7
:formula_8

There are other mathematical notations for multiplication:
* To reduce confusion between the multiplication sign × and the common variable , multiplication is also denoted by dot signs, usually a middle-position dot (rarely period): formula_9.
:The middle dot notation or dot operator, encoded in Unicode as , is now standard in the United States and other countries . When the dot operator character is not accessible, the interpunct (·) is used. In other countries that use a comma as a decimal mark, either the period or a middle dot is used for multiplication.
:Historically, in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the middle dot was sometimes used for the decimal to prevent it from disappearing in the ruled line, and the period/full stop was used for multiplication. However, since the Ministry of Technology ruled to use the period as the decimal point in 1968, and the International System of Units (SI) standard has since been widely adopted, this usage is now found only in the more traditional journals such as &quot;The Lancet&quot;.
* In algebra, multiplication involving variables is often written as a juxtaposition (e.g., formula_10 for formula_11 times formula_12 or formula_13 for five times formula_11), also called &quot;implied multiplication&quot;. The notation can also be used for quantities that are surrounded by parentheses (e.g., formula_15, formula_16 or formula_17 for five times two). This implicit usage of multiplication can cause ambiguity when the concatenated variables happen to match the name of another variable, when a variable name in front of a parenthesis can be confused with a function name, or in the correct determination of the order of operations.
* In vector multiplication, there is a distinction between the cross and the dot symbols. The cross symbol generally denotes the taking a cross product of two vectors, yielding a vector as its result, while the dot denotes taking the dot product of two vectors, resulting in a scalar.

In computer programming, the asterisk (as in codice_1) is still the most common notation. This is because most computers historically were limited to small character sets (such as ASCII and EBCDIC) that lacked a multiplication sign (such as codice_2 or codice_3), while the asterisk appeared on every keyboard. This usage originated in the FORTRAN programming language.
The numbers to be multiplied are generally called the &quot;factors&quot; (as in factorization). The number to be multiplied is the &quot;multiplicand&quot;, and the number by which it is multiplied is the &quot;multiplier&quot;. Usually, the multiplier is placed first, and the multiplicand is placed second; however, sometimes the first factor is considered the multiplicand and the second the multiplier.
Also, as the result of multiplication does not depend on the order of the factors, the distinction between &quot;multiplicand&quot; and &quot;multiplier&quot; is useful only at a very elementary level and in some multiplication algorithms, such as the long multiplication. Therefore, in some sources, the term &quot;multiplicand&quot; is regarded as a synonym for &quot;factor&quot;.
In algebra, a number that is the multiplier of a variable or expression (e.g., the 3 in formula_18) is called a coefficient.

The result of a multiplication is called a product. When one factor is an integer, the product is a &quot;multiple&quot; of the other or of the product of the others. Thus, formula_19 is a multiple of formula_20, as is formula_21. A product of integers is a multiple of each factor; for example, 15 is the product of 3 and 5 and is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5.

==Definitions==

The product of two numbers or the multiplication between two numbers can be defined for common special cases: natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers, and quaternions.

===Product of two natural numbers===
The product of two natural numbers formula_22 is defined as:

formula_23

===Product of two integers===
An integer can be either zero, a nonzero natural number, or minus a nonzero natural number. The product of zero and another integer is always zero. The product of two nonzero integers is determined by the product of their positive amounts, combined with the sign derived from the following rule:

formula_24
(This rule is a consequence of the distributivity of multiplication over addition, and is not an &quot;additional rule&quot;.)

In words:

* A positive number multiplied by a positive number is positive (product of natural numbers),
* A positive number multiplied by a negative number is negative,
* A negative number multiplied by a positive number is negative,
* A negative number multiplied by a negative number is positive.

===Product of two fractions===
Two fractions can be multiplied by multiplying their numerators and denominators:

:formula_25
:which is defined when formula_26.

=== Product of two real numbers ===

There are several equivalent ways to define formally the real numbers; see Construction of the real numbers. The definition of multiplication is a part of all these definitions. 

A fundamental aspect of these definitions is that every real number can be approximated to any accuracy by rational numbers. A standard way for expressing this is that every real number is the least upper bound of a set of rational numbers. In particular, every positive real number is the least upper bound of the truncations of its infinite decimal representation; for example, formula_20 is the least upper bound of formula_28

A fundamental property of real numbers is that rational approximations are compatible with arithmetic operations, and, in particular, with multiplication. This means that, if and are positive real numbers such that formula_29 and formula_30 then formula_31 In particular, the product of two positive real numbers is the least upper bound of the term-by-term products of the sequences of their decimal representations.

As changing the signs transforms least upper bounds into greatest lower bounds, the simplest way to deal with a multiplication involving one or two negative numbers, is to use the rule of signs described above in . The construction of the real numbers through Cauchy sequences is often preferred in order to avoid consideration of the four possible sign configurations.

===Product of two complex numbers===
Two complex numbers can be multiplied by the distributive law and the fact that formula_32, as follows:
:formula_33

The geometric meaning of complex multiplication can be understood by rewriting complex numbers in polar coordinates:

:formula_34

Furthermore,
:formula_35

from which one obtains
:formula_36

The geometric meaning is that the magnitudes are multiplied and the arguments are added.

===Product of two quaternions===
The product of two quaternions can be found in the article on quaternions. Note, in this case, that formula_37 and formula_38 are in general different.

==Computation==

Many common methods for multiplying numbers using pencil and paper require a multiplication table of memorized or consulted products of small numbers (typically any two numbers from 0 to 9). However, one method, the peasant multiplication algorithm, does not. The example below illustrates &quot;long multiplication&quot; (the &quot;standard algorithm&quot;, &quot;grade-school multiplication&quot;):

 23958233
 × 5830
 00000000 ( = 23,958,233 × 0)
 71874699 ( = 23,958,233 × 30)
 191665864 ( = 23,958,233 × 800)
 + 119791165 ( = 23,958,233 × 5,000)
 139676498390 ( = 139,676,498,390 )
In some countries such as Germany, the multiplication above is depicted similarly but with the original problem written on a single line and computation starting with the first digit of the multiplier:
 23958233 · 5830
 119791165
 191665864
 71874699
 00000000 
 139676498390
Multiplying numbers to more than a couple of decimal places by hand is tedious and error-prone. Common logarithms were invented to simplify such calculations, since adding logarithms is equivalent to multiplying. The slide rule allowed numbers to be quickly multiplied to about three places of accuracy. Beginning in the early 20th century, mechanical calculators, such as the Marchant, automated multiplication of up to 10-digit numbers. Modern electronic computers and calculators have greatly reduced the need for multiplication by hand.

===Historical algorithms===
Methods of multiplication were documented in the writings of ancient Egyptian, and Chinese civilizations.

The Ishango bone, dated to about 18,000 to 20,000 BC, may hint at a knowledge of multiplication in the Upper Paleolithic era in Central Africa, but this is speculative.

====Egyptians====

The Egyptian method of multiplication of integers and fractions, which is documented in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, was by successive additions and doubling. For instance, to find the product of 13 and 21 one had to double 21 three times, obtaining , , . The full product could then be found by adding the appropriate terms found in the doubling sequence:
:13 × 21 = (1 + 4 + 8) × 21 = (1 × 21) + (4 × 21) + (8 × 21) = 21 + 84 + 168 = 273.

====Babylonians====
The Babylonians used a sexagesimal positional number system, analogous to the modern-day decimal system. Thus, Babylonian multiplication was very similar to modern decimal multiplication. Because of the relative difficulty of remembering different products, Babylonian mathematicians employed multiplication tables. These tables consisted of a list of the first twenty multiples of a certain &quot;principal number&quot; &quot;n&quot;: &quot;n&quot;, 2&quot;n&quot;, ..., 20&quot;n&quot;; followed by the multiples of 10&quot;n&quot;: 30&quot;n&quot; 40&quot;n&quot;, and 50&quot;n&quot;. Then to compute any sexagesimal product, say 53&quot;n&quot;, one only needed to add 50&quot;n&quot; and 3&quot;n&quot; computed from the table.

====Chinese====
In the mathematical text &quot;Zhoubi Suanjing&quot;, dated prior to 300 BC, and the &quot;Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;, multiplication calculations were written out in words, although the early Chinese mathematicians employed Rod calculus involving place value addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The Chinese were already using a decimal multiplication table by the end of the Warring States period.

===Modern methods===

The modern method of multiplication based on the Hindu–Arabic numeral system was first described by Brahmagupta. Brahmagupta gave rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Henry Burchard Fine, then a professor of mathematics at Princeton University, wrote the following:
:&quot;The Indians are the inventors not only of the positional decimal system itself, but of most of the processes involved in elementary reckoning with the system. Addition and subtraction they performed quite as they are performed nowadays; multiplication they effected in many ways, ours among them, but division they did cumbrously.&quot;
These place value decimal arithmetic algorithms were introduced to Arab countries by Al Khwarizmi in the early 9th century and popularized in the Western world by Fibonacci in the 13th century.

====Grid method====
Grid method multiplication, or the box method, is used in primary schools in England and Wales and in some areas of the United States to help teach an understanding of how multiple digit multiplication works. An example of multiplying 34 by 13 would be to lay the numbers out in a grid as follows:

and then add the entries.

===Computer algorithms===

The classical method of multiplying two -digit numbers requires digit multiplications. Multiplication algorithms have been designed that reduce the computation time considerably when multiplying large numbers. Methods based on the discrete Fourier transform reduce the computational complexity to . In 2016, the factor was replaced by a function that increases much slower, though still not constant. In March 2019, David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven submitted a paper presenting an integer multiplication algorithm with a complexity of formula_39 The algorithm, also based on the fast Fourier transform, is conjectured to be asymptotically optimal. The algorithm is not practically useful, as it only becomes faster for multiplying extremely large numbers (having more than bits).

==Products of measurements==

One can only meaningfully add or subtract quantities of the same type, but quantities of different types can be multiplied or divided without problems. For example, four bags with three marbles each can be thought of as:
:[4 bags] × [3 marbles per bag] = 12 marbles.

When two measurements are multiplied together, the product is of a type depending on the types of measurements. The general theory is given by dimensional analysis. This analysis is routinely applied in physics, but it also has applications in finance and other applied fields.

A common example in physics is the fact that multiplying speed by time gives distance. For example:
:50 kilometers per hour × 3 hours = 150 kilometers.
In this case, the hour units cancel out, leaving the product with only kilometer units.

Other examples of multiplication involving units include:
:2.5 meters × 4.5 meters = 11.25 square meters
:11 meters/seconds × 9 seconds = 99 meters
:4.5 residents per house × 20 houses = 90 residents

==Product of a sequence==
===Capital pi notation===
The product of a sequence of factors can be written with the product symbol formula_40, which derives from the capital letter Π (pi) in the Greek alphabet (much like the same way the summation symbol formula_41 is derived from the Greek letter Σ (sigma)). The meaning of this notation is given by
:formula_42
which results in
:formula_43

In such a notation, the variable represents a varying integer, called the multiplication index, that runs from the lower value indicated in the subscript to the upper value given by the superscript. The product is obtained by multiplying together all factors obtained by substituting the multiplication index for an integer between the lower and the upper values (the bounds included) in the expression that follows the product operator.

More generally, the notation is defined as
:formula_44
where &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are integers or expressions that evaluate to integers. In the case where , the value of the product is the same as that of the single factor &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot;; if , the product is an empty product whose value is 1—regardless of the expression for the factors.

==== Properties of capital pi notation====
By definition, 
:formula_45

If all factors are identical, a product of factors is equivalent to exponentiation:
:formula_46

Associativity and commutativity of multiplication imply
:formula_47 and
:formula_48
if is a non-negative integer, or if all formula_49 are positive real numbers, and
:formula_50
if all formula_51 are non-negative integers, or if is a positive real number.

===Infinite products===

One may also consider products of infinitely many terms; these are called infinite products. Notationally, this consists in replacing &quot;n&quot; above by the infinity symbol ∞. The product of such an infinite sequence is defined as the limit of the product of the first &quot;n&quot; terms, as &quot;n&quot; grows without bound. That is,
:formula_52

One can similarly replace &quot;m&quot; with negative infinity, and define:
:formula_53
provided both limits exist.

==Exponentiation==

When multiplication is repeated, the resulting operation is known as &quot;exponentiation&quot;. For instance, the product of three factors of two (2×2×2) is &quot;two raised to the third power&quot;, and is denoted by 23, a two with a superscript three. In this example, the number two is the &quot;base&quot;, and three is the &quot;exponent&quot;. In general, the exponent (or superscript) indicates how many times the base appears in the expression, so that the expression
:formula_54
indicates that &quot;n&quot; copies of the base &quot;a&quot; are to be multiplied together. This notation can be used whenever multiplication is known to be power associative.

==Properties==

For real and complex numbers, which includes, for example, natural numbers, integers, and fractions, multiplication has certain properties:

;Commutative property
:The order in which two numbers are multiplied does not matter:
::formula_55

;Associative property
:Expressions solely involving multiplication or addition are invariant with respect to the order of operations:
::formula_56

;Distributive property
:Holds with respect to multiplication over addition. This identity is of prime importance in simplifying algebraic expressions:
::formula_57

;Identity element
:The multiplicative identity is 1; anything multiplied by 1 is itself. This feature of 1 is known as the identity property:
::formula_58

;Property of 0
:Any number multiplied by 0 is 0. This is known as the zero property of multiplication:
::formula_59

;Negation
:−1 times any number is equal to the additive inverse of that number:
::formula_60, where formula_61

:−1 times −1 is 1:
::formula_62

;Inverse element
:Every number &quot;x&quot;, except 0, has a multiplicative inverse, formula_63, such that formula_64.

;Order preservation
:Multiplication by a positive number preserves the order:
::For , if then .
:Multiplication by a negative number reverses the order:
::For , if then .
:The complex numbers do not have an ordering that is compatible with both addition and multiplication.

Other mathematical systems that include a multiplication operation may not have all these properties. For example, multiplication is not, in general, commutative for matrices and quaternions. Hurwitz&#x27;s theorem shows that for the hypercomplex numbers of dimension 8 or greater, including the octonions, sedenions, and trigintaduonions, multiplication is generally not associative.

==Axioms==

In the book &quot;Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita&quot;, Giuseppe Peano proposed axioms for arithmetic based on his axioms for natural numbers. Peano arithmetic has two axioms for multiplication:
:formula_65
:formula_66

Here &quot;S&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) represents the successor of &quot;y&quot;; i.e., the natural number that follows &quot;y&quot;. The various properties like associativity can be proved from these and the other axioms of Peano arithmetic, including induction. For instance, &quot;S&quot;(0), denoted by 1, is a multiplicative identity because
:formula_67

The axioms for integers typically define them as equivalence classes of ordered pairs of natural numbers. The model is based on treating (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) as equivalent to when &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are treated as integers. Thus both (0,1) and (1,2) are equivalent to −1. The multiplication axiom for integers defined this way is
:formula_68

The rule that −1 × −1 = 1 can then be deduced from
:formula_69

Multiplication is extended in a similar way to rational numbers and then to real numbers.

==Multiplication with set theory==
The product of non-negative integers can be defined with set theory using cardinal numbers or the Peano axioms. See below how to extend this to multiplying arbitrary integers, and then arbitrary rational numbers. The product of real numbers is defined in terms of products of rational numbers; see construction of the real numbers.

==Multiplication in group theory==
There are many sets that, under the operation of multiplication, satisfy the axioms that define group structure. These axioms are closure, associativity, and the inclusion of an identity element and inverses.

A simple example is the set of non-zero rational numbers. Here identity 1 is had, as opposed to groups under addition where the identity is typically 0. Note that with the rationals, zero must be excluded because, under multiplication, it does not have an inverse: there is no rational number that can be multiplied by zero to result in 1. In this example, an abelian group is had, but that is not always the case.

To see this, consider the set of invertible square matrices of a given dimension over a given field. Here, it is straightforward to verify closure, associativity, and inclusion of identity (the identity matrix) and inverses. However, matrix multiplication is not commutative, which shows that this group is non-abelian.

Another fact worth noticing is that the integers under multiplication do not form a group—even if zero is excluded. This is easily seen by the nonexistence of an inverse for all elements other than 1 and −1.

Multiplication in group theory is typically notated either by a dot or by juxtaposition (the omission of an operation symbol between elements). So multiplying element a by element b could be notated as a formula_70 b or ab. When referring to a group via the indication of the set and operation, the dot is used. For example, our first example could be indicated by formula_71.

==Multiplication of different kinds of numbers==
Numbers can &quot;count&quot; (3 apples), &quot;order&quot; (the 3rd apple), or &quot;measure&quot; (3.5 feet high); as the history of mathematics has progressed from counting on our fingers to modelling quantum mechanics, multiplication has been generalized to more complicated and abstract types of numbers, and to things that are not numbers (such as matrices) or do not look much like numbers (such as quaternions).

; Integers
: formula_72 is the sum of &quot;N&quot; copies of &quot;M&quot; when &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot; are positive whole numbers. This gives the number of things in an array &quot;N&quot; wide and &quot;M&quot; high. Generalization to negative numbers can be done by
: formula_73 and
: formula_74
: The same sign rules apply to rational and real numbers.

; Rational numbers
: Generalization to fractions formula_75 is by multiplying the numerators and denominators, respectively: formula_76. This gives the area of a rectangle formula_77 high and formula_78 wide, and is the same as the number of things in an array when the rational numbers happen to be whole numbers.

; Real numbers
: Real numbers and their products can be defined in terms of sequences of rational numbers.

; Complex numbers
: Considering complex numbers formula_79 and formula_80 as ordered pairs of real numbers formula_81 and formula_82, the product formula_83 is formula_84. This is the same as for reals formula_85 when the &quot;imaginary parts&quot; formula_86 and formula_87 are zero.

: Equivalently, denoting formula_88 as formula_89, formula_90
: Alternatively, in trigonometric form, if formula_91, thenformula_92

; Further generalizations
: See Multiplication in group theory, above, and multiplicative group, which for example includes matrix multiplication. A very general, and abstract, concept of multiplication is as the &quot;multiplicatively denoted&quot; (second) binary operation in a ring. An example of a ring that is not any of the number systems above is a polynomial ring (polynomials can be added and multiplied, but polynomials are not numbers in any usual sense).

; Division
: Often division, formula_93, is the same as multiplication by an inverse, formula_94. Multiplication for some types of &quot;numbers&quot; may have corresponding division, without inverses; in an integral domain &quot;x&quot; may have no inverse &quot;formula_63&quot; but formula_93 may be defined. In a division ring there are inverses, but formula_93 may be ambiguous in non-commutative rings since formula_94 need not be the same as formula_99.

<text>Malt is any cereal grain that has been made to germinate by soaking in water and then stopped from germinating further by drying with hot air, a process known as &quot;malting&quot;.
Malted grain is used to make beer, whisky, malted milk, malt vinegar, confections such as Maltesers and Whoppers, flavored drinks such as Horlicks, Ovaltine, and Milo, and some baked goods, such as malt loaf, bagels, and Rich Tea biscuits. Malted grain that has been ground into a coarse meal is known as &quot;sweet meal&quot;. 

Malting grain develops the enzymes (α-amylase, β-amylase) required for modifying the grains&#x27; starches into various types of sugar, including monosaccharide glucose, disaccharide maltose, trisaccharide maltotriose, and higher sugars called maltodextrines. It also develops other enzymes, such as proteases, that break down the proteins in the grain into forms that can be used by yeast. The point at which the malting process is stopped affects the starch-to-enzyme ratio, and partly converted starch becomes fermentable sugars.

Malt also contains small amounts of other sugars, such as sucrose and fructose, which are not products of starch modification, but which are already in the grain. Further conversion to fermentable sugars is achieved during the mashing process.

Various cereals are malted, though barley is the most common. A high-protein form of malted barley is often a label-listed ingredient in blended flours typically used in the manufacture of yeast bread and other baked goods.
The term refers to several products of the process: the grains to which this process has been applied, for example, malted barley; the sugar, heavy in maltose, derived from such grains, such as the baker&#x27;s malt used in various breakfast cereals; single malt whisky, often called simply &quot;single malt&quot;; or a product based on malted milk, similar to a malted milkshake (i.e. &quot;malts&quot;).

==History and traditional usage==
Malted grains have probably been used as an ingredient of beer since ancient times, for example in Egypt (Ancient Egyptian cuisine), Sumer, and China.

In Persian countries, a sweet paste made entirely from germinated wheat is called &quot;samanū&quot; () in Iran, &quot;samanak&quot; () in Afghanistan, (); () or &quot;sümölök&quot; (), which is prepared for Nowruz (Persian new year celebration) in a large pot (like a &quot;kazan&quot;). A plate or bowl of &quot;samanu&quot; is a traditional component of the Haft sin table symbolising affluence. Traditionally, women have a special party to prepare it during the night, and cook it from late in the evening until the daylight, singing related songs. In Tajikistan and Afghanistan, they sing: &quot;Samanak dar Jūsh u mā Kafcha zanēm – Dīgarān dar Khwāb u mā Dafcha zanēm&quot; (meaning: &quot;Samanak is boiling and we are stirring it, others are asleep and we are playing daf&quot;). In modern times, making &quot;samanu&quot; can be a family gathering. It originally comes from the Great Persian Empire.

&quot;Mämmi&quot;, or Easter Porridge, is a traditional Finnish Lenten food. Cooked from rye malt and flour, &quot;mämmi&quot; has a great resemblance (in the recipe, color, and taste) to &quot;samanū&quot;. Today, this product is available in shops from February until Easter. A (nonrepresentative) survey in 2013 showed that almost no one cooks&quot; mämmi&quot; at home in modern-day Finland.

==Malting==

Malting is the process of converting barley or other cereal grains into malt for use in brewing, distilling, or foods, and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a malting floor. The cereal is spread out on the malting floor in a layer of depth. 

;Drying
:The malting process starts with drying the grains to a moisture content below 14% and then storing for around six weeks to overcome seed dormancy. 
;Steeping
:When ready, the grain is immersed or steeped in water two or three times for two or three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to start to sprout. 
;Germination
:When the grain has a moisture content of around 46%, it is transferred to the malting or germination floor, where it is constantly turned over for about four to six days while it is air-dried. 
;Pre-toasting
:The grain at this point, called &quot;green malt&quot;, is then dried and toasted in an oven (or kiln) to the desired color and specification. Malts range in color from very pale through crystal and amber to chocolate or black malts.
;Smoking
:The sprouted grain is then further dried and smoked by spreading it on a perforated wooden floor. Smoke coming from an oasting fireplace (via smoke channels) is then used to heat the wooden floor and the sprouted grains. The temperature is usually around . 

A &quot;maltings&quot; is typically a long, single-storey building with a floor that slopes slightly from one end of the building to the other. Floor maltings began to be phased out in the 1940s in favor of &quot;pneumatic plants&quot;, where large industrial fans are used to blow air through the germinating grain beds and to pass hot air through the malt being kilned. Like floor maltings, these pneumatic plants use batch processes, but of considerably greater size, typically 100-ton batches compared with 20-ton batches floor maltings.

, the largest malting operation in the world was Malteurop, which operates in 14 countries.

==Production==

Barley is the most commonly malted grain, in part because of its high content of enzymes, though wheat, rye, oats, rice, and corn are also used. Also very important is the retention of the grain&#x27;s husk, even after threshing, unlike the bare seeds of threshed wheat or rye. This protects the growing acrospire (developing plant embryo) from damage during malting, which can easily lead to mold growth; it also allows the mash of converted grain to create a filter bed during lautering.

==Malts==
===Diastatic and nondiastatic===
As all grains sprout, natural enzymes within the grain break down the starch of which the grain is composed into simpler sugars, which taste sweet and are easier for yeast to use as food. Malt with active enzymes is called &quot;diastatic malt&quot;. Malt with inactive enzymes is called &quot;nondiastatic malt&quot;. The enzymes are deactivated by heating the malt.

===Base and specialty===

Malt is often divided into two categories by brewers: base malts and specialty malts.

Base malts have enough diastatic power to convert their own starch and usually, that of some amount of starch from unmalted grain, called adjuncts.

Specialty malts have little diastatic power, but provide flavor, color, or &quot;body&quot; (viscosity) to the finished beer. Specialty caramel or crystal malts have been subjected to heat treatment to convert their starches to sugars nonenzymatically. Within these categories is a variety of types distinguished largely by the kilning temperature.

===Two-row and six-row===
In addition, barley malts are distinguished by the two major cultivar types of barley used for malting, two-row, and six-row.

==Malt extract==

Malt extract, also known as extract of malt, is a sweet, treacle-like substance used as a dietary supplement. It was popular in the first half of the 20th century as a nutritional enhancer for the children of the British urban working class, whose diet was often deficient in vitamins and minerals. Children were given cod liver oil for the same reason, but it proved so unpalatable that it was combined with extract of malt to produce &quot;Malt and Cod-Liver Oil.&quot;

The 1907 &quot;British Pharmaceutical Codex&quot;″s instructions for making a nutritional extract of malt do not include a mashout at the end of extraction and include the use of lower mash temperatures than is typical with modern beer-brewing practices. The &quot;Codex&quot; indicates that diastatic activity is to be preserved by the use of temperatures not exceeding .

===Malt extract production===
Malt extract is frequently used in the brewing of beer. Its production begins by germinating barley grain in a process known as malting, which consists of immersing the barley in water to encourage it to sprout, then drying it to halt the progress when the sprouting begins. The drying step stops the sprouting, but the enzymes remain active due to the low temperatures used in base malt production. In one before-and-after comparison, malting decreased barley&#x27;s extractable starch content by about 7% on a dry matter basis and turned that portion into various other carbohydrates.

In the next step, brewers use a process called mashing to extract the sugars. Brewers warm cracked malt in temperature-modulated water, activating the enzymes, which cleave more of the malt&#x27;s remaining starch into various sugars, the largest percentage of which is maltose. Modern beer-mashing practices typically include high enough temperatures at mash-out to deactivate remaining enzymes, thus it is no longer . The liquid produced from this, wort, is then concentrated by using heat or a vacuum procedure to evaporate water from the mixture. The concentrated wort is called malt extract.

=== Malt extract types ===
Two forms of malt extract are used by brewers: liquid malt extract (LME), containing about 20% water, and dry malt extract (DME), dehydrated to 2% water. LME is a thick syrup that typically gives off more pleasant flavors than its counterpart, while DME provides better consistency in color. When using large amounts of extract, LME is typically used because its ability to dissolve in boiling temperatures, whereas DME can clump up and become difficult to liquefy. LME is also sold in jars as a consumer product.

==Research==
Scientists aim to discover what happens inside barley grains as they become malted to help plant breeders produce better malting barley for food and beverage products. The United States Agricultural Research Service scientists are interested in specialized enzymes called serine-class proteases that digest beta-amylases, which convert carbohydrates into &quot;simple sugars&quot; during the sprouting process. The enzyme also breaks down stored proteins into their amino-acid derivatives. The balance of proteins and carbohydrates broken down by the enzyme affects the malt&#x27;s flavor.

=== Enzyme-rich malt extract ===
Enzyme-rich malt extract (ERME) is a specialised form of barley malt extract (marketed by Ateria Health), that has undergone preparation to activate the natural amylase and glucanase enzymes in the grain. Initially researched as an equine food supplement, pilot studies using ERME as a human food supplement have suggested that it could potentially improve the symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and chronic constipation, due to the way it can break down carbohydrates in the small intestine that IBS has been found to hinder. However further research is ongoing to fully prove this link.

<text>Masonry is the craft of building a structure with brick, stone, or similar material, including mortar plastering which are often laid in, bound, and pasted together by mortar. The term &quot;masonry&quot; can also refer to the building units (stone, brick, etc.) themselves.

The common materials of masonry construction are bricks and building stone, rocks such as marble, granite, and limestone, cast stone, concrete blocks, glass blocks, and adobe. Masonry is generally a highly durable form of construction. However, the materials used, the quality of the mortar and workmanship, and the pattern in which the units are assembled can substantially affect the durability of the overall masonry construction.

A person who constructs masonry is called a mason or bricklayer. These are both classified as construction trades.

== History ==
Masonry is one of the oldest building crafts in the world. The construction of Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and medieval cathedrals are all examples of masonry. Early structures used the weight of the masonry itself to stabilize the structure against lateral movements. The types and techniques of masonry used evolved with architectural needs and cultural norms. Since mid-20th century, masonry has often featured steel-reinforced elements to help carry the tension force present in modern thin, light, tall building systems.

==Applications==
Masonry has both structural and non-structural applications. Structural applications include walls, columns, beams, foundations, load-bearing arches, and others. On the other hand, masonry is also used in non-structural applications such as fireplaces chimneys and veneer systems.

Brick and concrete block are the most common types of masonry in use in industrialized nations and may be either load-bearing or non-load-bearing. Concrete blocks, especially those with hollow cores, offer various possibilities in masonry construction. They generally provide great compressive strength and are best suited to structures with light transverse loading when the cores remain unfilled. Filling some or all of the cores with concrete or concrete with steel reinforcement (typically rebar) offers much greater tensile and lateral strength to structures.

===Advantages===
* The use of materials such as bricks and stones can increase the thermal mass of a building.
* Masonry is a non-combustible product and can protect the building from fire.
* Masonry walls are more resistant to projectiles, such as debris from hurricanes or tornadoes.

===Disadvantages===
* Extreme weather, under certain circumstances, can cause degradation of masonry due to expansion and contraction forces associated with freeze-thaw cycles.
* Masonry tends to be heavy and must be built on a stable ground made of either undisturbed or mechanically-compacted soil, otherwise cracking may occur.
* Unlike concrete, masonry construction does not lend itself well to mechanization, and requires more skilled labor.

===Structural limitations===
One problem with masonry walls is that they rely mainly on their weight to keep them in place; each block or brick is only loosely connected to the next via a thin layer of mortar. This is why they do not perform well in earthquakes, when entire buildings are shaken horizontally. Many collapses during earthquakes occur in buildings that have load-bearing masonry walls. Besides, heavier buildings having masonry suffer more damage.

==Dry set masonry==
The strength of a masonry wall is not entirely dependent on the bond between the building material and the mortar; the friction between the interlocking blocks of masonry is often strong enough to provide a great deal of strength on its own. The blocks sometimes have grooves or other surface features added to enhance this interlocking, and some &quot;dry set&quot; masonry structures forgo mortar altogether.

==Stonework==

Stone blocks used in masonry can be dressed or rough, though in both examples corners, door and window jambs, and similar areas are usually dressed.
Stonemasonry utilizing dressed stones is known as ashlar masonry, whereas masonry using irregularly shaped stones is known as rubble masonry. Both rubble and ashlar masonry can be laid in coursed rows of even height through the careful selection or cutting of stones, but a great deal of stone masonry is uncoursed.
* Slipform stonemasonry produces a hybrid wall of reinforced concrete with a rubble stone face.
* Natural stone veneers over CMU, cast-in-place, or tilt-up concrete walls are widely used to give the appearance of stone masonry.
* Sometimes river rock of smooth oval-shaped stones is used as a veneer. This type of material is not favored for solid masonry as it requires a great amount of mortar and can lack intrinsic structural strength.
* Manufactured-stone, or cultured stone, veneers are popular alternatives to natural stones.
* Manufactured-stone veneers are typically made from concrete.
* Natural stones from quarries around the world are sampled and recreated using molds, aggregate, and colorfast pigments.
* To the casual observer there may be no visual difference between veneers of natural and manufactured stone.

==Brick==
Solid brickwork is made of two or more wythes of bricks with the units running horizontally (called &quot;stretcher&quot; bricks) bound together with bricks running transverse to the wall (called &quot;header&quot; bricks). Each row of bricks is known as a course. The pattern of headers and stretchers employed gives rise to different &#x27;bonds&#x27; such as the common bond (with every sixth course composed of headers), the English bond, and the Flemish bond (with alternating stretcher and header bricks present on every course). Bonds can differ in strength and in insulating ability. Vertically staggered bonds tend to be somewhat stronger and less prone to major cracking than a non-staggered bond.

===Uniformity and rusticity===

The wide selection of brick styles and types generally available in industrialized nations allow much variety in the appearance of the final product. In buildings built during the 1950s-1970s, a high degree of uniformity of brick and accuracy in masonry was typical. In the period since then this style was thought to be too sterile, so attempts were made to emulate older, rougher work. Some brick surfaces are made to look particularly rustic by including &quot;burnt&quot; bricks, which have a darker color or an irregular shape. Others may use antique salvage bricks, or new bricks may be artificially aged by applying various surface treatments, such as tumbling. The attempts at rusticity of the late 20th century have been carried forward by masons specializing in a free, artistic style, where the courses are intentionally &quot;not&quot; straight, instead weaving to form more organic impressions.

===Serpentine masonry===

A crinkle-crankle wall is a brick wall that follows a serpentine path, rather than a straight line. This type of wall is more resistant to toppling than a straight wall; so much so that it may be made of a single wythe of unreinforced brick and so despite its longer length may be more economical than a straight wall.

==Concrete block==

Blocks of cinder concrete (&quot;cinder blocks&quot; or &quot;breezeblocks&quot;), ordinary concrete (&quot;concrete blocks&quot;), or hollow tile are generically known as Concrete Masonry Units (CMUs). They usually are much larger than ordinary bricks and so are much faster to lay for a wall of a given size. Furthermore, cinder and concrete blocks typically have much lower water absorption rates than brick. They often are used as the structural core for veneered brick masonry or are used alone for the walls of factories, garages, and other industrial-style buildings where such appearance is acceptable or desirable. Such blocks often receive a stucco surface for decoration. Surface-bonding cement, which contains synthetic fibers for reinforcement, is sometimes used in this application and can impart extra strength to a block wall. Surface-bonding cement is often pre-colored and can be stained or painted thus resulting in a finished stucco-like surface.

The primary structural advantage of concrete blocks in comparison to smaller clay-based bricks is that a CMU wall can be reinforced by filling the block voids with concrete with or without steel rebar. Generally, certain voids are designated for filling and reinforcement, particularly at corners, wall-ends, and openings while other voids are left empty. This increases wall strength and stability more economically than filling and reinforcing all voids. Typically, structures made of CMUs will have the top course of blocks in the walls filled with concrete and tied together with steel reinforcement to form a bond beam. Bond beams are often a requirement of modern building codes and controls. Another type of steel reinforcement referred to as ladder-reinforcement, can also be embedded in horizontal mortar joints of concrete block walls. The introduction of steel reinforcement generally results in a CMU wall having much greater lateral and tensile strength than unreinforced walls.

&quot;Architectural masonry is the evolvement of standard concrete masonry blocks into aesthetically pleasing concrete masonry units (CMUs)&quot;. CMUs can be manufactured to provide a variety of surface appearances. They can be colored during manufacturing or stained or painted after installation. They can be split as part of the manufacturing process, giving the blocks a rough face replicating the appearance of natural stone, such as brownstone. CMUs may also be scored, ribbed, sandblasted, polished, striated (raked or brushed), include decorative aggregates, be allowed to slump in a controlled fashion during curing, or include several of these techniques in their manufacture to provide a decorative appearance.

&quot;Glazed concrete masonry units are manufactured by bonding a permanent colored facing (typically composed of polyester resins, silica sand and various other chemicals) to a concrete masonry unit, providing a smooth impervious surface.&quot;

Glass block or glass brick are blocks made from glass and provide a translucent to clear vision through the block.

== Veneer masonry ==
A masonry veneer wall consists of masonry units, usually clay-based bricks, installed on one or both sides of a structurally independent wall usually constructed of wood or masonry. In this context, the brick masonry is primarily decorative, not structural. The brick veneer is generally connected to the structural wall by brick ties (metal strips that are attached to the structural wall, as well as the mortar joints of the brick veneer). There is typically an air gap between the brick veneer and the structural wall. As clay-based brick is usually not completely waterproof, the structural wall will often have a water-resistant surface (usually tar paper) and weep holes can be left at the base of the brick veneer to drain moisture that accumulates inside the air gap. Concrete blocks, real and cultured stones, and veneer adobe are sometimes used in a very similar veneer fashion.

Most insulated buildings that use concrete block, brick, adobe, stone, veneers or some combination thereof feature interior insulation in the form of fiberglass batts between wooden wall studs or in the form of rigid insulation boards covered with plaster or drywall. In most climates this insulation is much more effective on the exterior of the wall, allowing the building interior to take advantage of the aforementioned thermal mass of the masonry. This technique does, however, require some sort of weather-resistant exterior surface over the insulation and, consequently, is generally more expensive.

==Gabions==

Gabions are baskets, usually now of zinc-protected steel (galvanized steel) that are filled with fractured stone of medium size. These will act as a single unit and are stacked with setbacks to form a revetment or retaining wall. They have the advantage of being well drained, flexible, and resistant to flood, water flow from above, frost damage, and soil flow. Their expected useful life is only as long as the wire they are composed of and if used in severe climates (such as shore-side in a salt water environment) must be made of appropriate corrosion-resistant wire. Most modern gabions are rectangular. Earlier gabions were often cylindrical wicker baskets, open at both ends, used usually for temporary, often military, construction.

Similar work can be done with finer aggregates using cellular confinement.

==Passive fire protection (PFP)==

Masonry walls have an endothermic effect of its hydrates, as in chemically bound water, unbound moisture from the concrete block, and the poured concrete if the hollow cores inside the blocks are filled. Masonry can withstand temperatures up to and it can withstand direct exposure to fire for up to 4 hours. In addition to that, concrete masonry keeps fires contained to their room of origin 93% of the time. For those reasons, concrete and masonry units hold the highest flame spread index classification, Class A.

Fire cuts can be used to increase safety and reduce fire damage to masonry buildings.

==Mechanical modeling of masonry structures==

From the point of view of material modeling, masonry is a special material of extreme mechanical properties (with a very high ratio between strength in compression and in tension), so that the applied loads do not diffuse as they do in elastic bodies, but tend to percolate along lines of high stiffness.

<text>Mickey Mouse is an American cartoon character co-created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. The longtime icon and mascot of the Walt Disney Company, Mickey is an anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large shoes, and white gloves. He is often depicted with a cast of characters including his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, his pet dog Pluto, his best friends Donald Duck and Goofy, and his nemesis Pete.
Mickey was created as a replacement for a prior Disney character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. The character was originally to be named &quot;Mortimer Mouse&quot;, until Disney&#x27;s wife, Lillian, suggested &quot;Mickey&quot;. Mickey first appeared in two 1928 shorts &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; and &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; (which were not picked up for distribution) before his public debut in &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; (1928). The character went on to appear in over 130 films, mostly shorts as well as features such as &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940). Since 1930, Mickey has been featured extensively in comic strips (including the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip, which ran for 45 years) and comic books (such as &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;). The character has also been featured in television series such as &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; (1955–1996).
Inspired by such silent film personalities as Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, Mickey is traditionally characterized as a sympathetic underdog who gets by on pluck and ingenuity in the face of challenges bigger than himself. The character&#x27;s depiction as a small mouse is personified through his diminutive stature and falsetto voice, the latter of which was originally provided by Walt Disney. Though originally characterized as a cheeky lovable rogue, Mickey was rebranded over time as a nice guy, usually seen as a spirited, yet impulsive hero.
Mickey also appears in media such as video games as well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the Disney parks. He is one of the world&#x27;s most recognizable and universally acclaimed fictional characters. Ten of Mickey&#x27;s cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, one of which, &quot;Lend a Paw&quot;, won the award in 1941. In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
==Creation==
Mickey Mouse was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, an earlier cartoon character that was created by the Disney studio but owned at the time by Universal Pictures. Charles Mintz served as a middleman producer between Disney and Universal through his company, Winkler Pictures, for the series of cartoons starring Oswald. In a February 1928 meeting with Mintz to renew the Oswald contract, Disney was met by a disappointing budget cut proposal, along with Mintz&#x27;s revelation that several of the most important Disney animators were coming over to his studio. Among the few who stayed at the Disney studio were animator Ub Iwerks, apprentice artist Les Clark, and Wilfred Jackson.

A new character was workshopped out of necessity and in relative secret. Various myths exist of Walt Disney&#x27;s inspiration for Mickey (including some which were likely ), such as that the starving artist drew inspiration from a tame mouse (or pair of mice) at his desk at Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri, or that he undertook a romantic search for inspiration on the train ride home from his disappointing meeting with Mintz. At Disney&#x27;s behest, Iwerks sketched new character ideas based on various animals such as dogs and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were rejected, as was a male frog. In 1925, Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney, reputedly based on Disney&#x27;s own designs (similar to those he included on family birthday cards). These inspired Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney.
&quot;Mortimer Mouse&quot; had been Disney&#x27;s original name for the character before his wife, Lillian, convinced him to change it. It has been speculated that Disney saw the name on a similarly named Performo toy. Additionally, actor Mickey Rooney claimed that during his time performing as the title character of the &quot;Mickey McGuire&quot; film series (1927–1934), he met Walt Disney at the Warner Bros. studio, inspiring Disney to name the character after him; however, Disney Studios was located on Hyperion Avenue at the time, with Disney conducting no business at Warner Bros.

The first feature-length movie with dialogue sequences, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; starring Al Jolson, was released on October 6, 1927. Several additional talkies followed, and movie theaters began installing the necessary equipment. Walt Disney reputedly discussed making sound cartoons in late May 1928. After composer Carl W. Stalling initially voiced Mickey for the 1929 talkie shorts &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot; and &quot;Wild Waves&quot;, Disney himself provided the often-shy falsetto voice—a large part of the character&#x27;s onscreen persona.

=== Design ===
Mickey&#x27;s original design strongly resembled Oswald the Rabbit, save for the ears, nose, and tail. Ub Iwerks designed Mickey&#x27;s body out of circles (distinctly, the ears) to make the character easy to animate.
Upon his creation, Mickey&#x27;s features shared similarities to a number of his cartoon predecessors with large eyes and mouth on a black body (e.g. Oswald and Felix the Cat). From early 1929, Mickey also wore white gloves (similar to those appearing on later characters, e.g. Bosko and Bimbo). Several sources state that this scheme evolved from blackface caricatures used in minstrel shows.
Additionally, Mickey&#x27;s original black hands could not be seen if they passed in front of his torso. This limitation encouraged animators to base their poses on silhouette, much in the manner of Charlie Chaplin films.

Minnie Mouse was designed similarly to Mickey, with only superficial details being different. In the 1930s, animator Fred Moore tried giving Mickey&#x27;s body more of a pear shape to increase his acting range; Walt Disney liked this adaptation and declared, &quot;that&#x27;s the way I want Mickey to be drawn from now on.&quot; Moore maintained that the character should always be drawn from a pleasing angle, ears included, as opposed to depicting Mickey as a realistic 3D character.

Mickey&#x27;s eyes were originally large and white with black outlines, with the tops able to deform like eyebrows; the pupil was circular (with a triangle cut out in poster to simulate reflected light). Starting with &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, the bottom portion of the black outlines was removed, often making the pupil placement look strange. The pupils began to be treated as stationary, dotlike eyes, requiring the entire head to be moved to make Mickey look around. During the production of &quot;Fantasia&quot; in the late 1930s, Fred Moore redesigned Mickey with small white pupilled eyes, with the redefined facial area being given a light skin color. Distinct, lined eyebrows were later added and are currently used occasionally.

Besides Mickey&#x27;s gloves and shoes, he typically wears only a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front. Before Mickey was seen regularly in color animation, Mickey&#x27;s shorts were either red or a dull blue-green. With the advent of Mickey&#x27;s color films, they were always red. When Mickey is not wearing his shorts, he is often still wearing red clothing. Due to budgetary limits imposed by World War II, Mickey temporarily lost his tail, e.g. in &quot;The Little Whirlwind&quot; (1941).

== Appearances ==

===Film===
====Debut (1928)====
Mickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;, on May 15, 1928, but it failed to impress the audience and Walt could not find a distributor for it. Walt went on to produce a second Mickey short, &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot;, which was also not released for lack of a distributor.

&quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; was first released on November 18, 1928, in New York. It was by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Iwerks again served as the head animator, assisted by Les Clark, Johnny Cannon, Wilfred Jackson and Dick Lundy. This short was a nod to Buster Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot;, released earlier that year. Although it was the third Mickey cartoon produced, it was the first to find a distributor, and thus is considered by The Disney Company as Mickey&#x27;s debut. It also featured some design refinements, and included the use of a bouncing ball on the film print to allow conductors and musicians to match the tempo of their music with the film.

The cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action. Fleischer Studios, headed by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer, had already released a number of sound cartoons using the DeForest system in the mid-1920s. However, these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film. For &quot;Willie&quot;, Disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat. This precise timing is apparent during the &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; sequence when Mickey&#x27;s actions exactly match the accompanying instruments. Animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the film&#x27;s original music. This role has been variously attributed to Wilfred Jackson, Carl Stalling and Bert Lewis, but identification remains uncertain. Walt Disney himself was voice actor for both Mickey and Minnie and would remain the source of Mickey&#x27;s voice through 1946 for theatrical cartoons. Jimmy MacDonald took over the role in 1946, but Walt provided Mickey&#x27;s voice again from 1955 to 1959 for &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; television series on ABC.

Audiences at the time of &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;″s release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes. Sound films or &quot;talkies&quot; were still considered innovative. Most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to Disney. As a result, Mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time. Walt Disney soon worked on adding sound to both &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; and &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; (which had originally been silent releases) and their new release added to Mickey&#x27;s success and popularity. A fourth Mickey short, &quot;The Barn Dance&quot;, was also put into production; however, Mickey does not actually speak until &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot; (1929). After &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; was released, Mickey became a close competitor to Felix the Cat, and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons. By 1929, Felix would lose popularity among theater audiences, and Pat Sullivan decided to produce all future Felix cartoons in sound as a result. Audiences did not respond well to Felix&#x27;s transition to sound and by 1930, Felix had faded from the screen.

====Black and white films (1929–1935)====

In Mickey&#x27;s early films he was often characterized not as a hero, but as an ineffective young suitor to Minnie Mouse. &quot;The Barn Dance&quot; (March 14, 1929) is the first time in which Mickey is turned down by Minnie in favor of Pete. &quot;The Opry House&quot; (March 28, 1929) was the first time in which Mickey wore his white gloves. Mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit. The three lines on the back of Mickey&#x27;s gloves represent darts in the gloves&#x27; fabric extending from between the digits of the hand, typical of glove design of the era.

&quot;When the Cat&#x27;s Away&quot; (April 18, 1929), essentially a remake of the &quot;Alice Comedy&quot;, &quot;Alice Rattled by Rats&quot;, was an unusual appearance for Mickey. Although Mickey and Minnie still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics, they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community of many other mice as pests in a home. Mickey and Minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting. In appearances with real humans, Mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high. The next Mickey short was also unusual. &quot;The Barnyard Battle&quot; (April 25, 1929) was the only film to depict Mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat. &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot; (1929) was the first time Mickey spoke. Before this he had only whistled, laughed, and grunted. His first words were &quot;Hot dogs! Hot dogs!&quot; said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival. &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Follies&quot; (1929) introduced the song &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Yoo-Hoo&quot; which would become the theme song for &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; films until 1935. The same song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of 1930s theater-based Mickey Mouse Clubs. Mickey&#x27;s dog Pluto first appeared as Mickey&#x27;s pet in &quot;The Moose Hunt&quot; (1931) after previously appearing as Minnie&#x27;s dog &quot;Rover&quot; in &quot;The Picnic&quot; (1930).

&quot;Wild Waves&quot; was the last Mickey Mouse cartoon to be animated by Ub Iwerks. Iwerks left to start his own studio, bankrolled by Disney&#x27;s then-distributor Pat Powers. Powers and Disney had a falling out over money due Disney from the distribution deal. It was in response to losing the right to distribute Disney&#x27;s cartoons that Powers made the deal with Iwerks, who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio. The departure is considered a turning point in Mickey&#x27;s career, as well as that of Walt Disney. Walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since 1919. Mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction or animation of several of the shorts released till this point. Advertising for the early Mickey Mouse cartoons credited them as &quot;A Walt Disney Comic, drawn by Ub Iwerks&quot;. Later Disney Company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit Walt Disney alone. &quot;Wild Waves&quot; was also composer Carl Stalling&#x27;s last film with the Walt Disney Studio. Stalling joined Iwerks at his new studio.

Disney and his remaining staff continued the production of the Mickey series, and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace Iwerks. As the Great Depression progressed and Felix the Cat faded from the movie screen, Mickey&#x27;s popularity would rise, and by 1932 The Mickey Mouse Club would have one million members. At the 5th Academy Awards in 1932, Mickey received his first Academy Award nomination, received for &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Orphans&quot; (1931). Walt Disney also received an honorary Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse. Despite being eclipsed by the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; short the &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; in 1933, Mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too, until 1935, when polls showed that Popeye was more popular than Mickey. By 1934, Mickey merchandise had earned $600,000 a year. In 1935, Disney began to phase out the Mickey Mouse Clubs, due to administration problems.

About this time, story artists at Disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for Mickey. As he had developed into a role model for children, they were limited in the types of gags they could present. This led to Mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films, allowing for more emphasis on other characters. In &quot;Orphan&#x27;s Benefit&quot; (1934), Mickey first appeared with Donald Duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; series. The tempestuous duck would provide Disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in Mickey&#x27;s cartoons.

====Color films (1935–1953)====

Mickey first appeared animated in color in &quot;Parade of the Award Nominees&quot; in 1932; however, the film strip was created for the 5th Academy Awards ceremony and was not released to the public. Mickey&#x27;s official first color film came in 1935 with &quot;The Band Concert&quot;. The Technicolor film process was used in the film production. Here Mickey conducted the &quot;William Tell Overture&quot;, but the band is swept up by a tornado. It is said that conductor Arturo Toscanini so loved this short that, upon first seeing it, he asked the projectionist to run it again. In 1994, &quot;The Band Concert&quot; was voted the third-greatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals. By colorizing and partially redesigning Mickey, Walt put Mickey back on top once again. Mickey reach new heights of popularity. Also in 1935, Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey.

The second half of the 1930s saw the character Goofy reintroduced as a series regular. Together, Mickey, Donald Duck, and Goofy would go on several adventures together. Several of the films by the comic trio are some of Mickey&#x27;s most critically acclaimed films, including &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Fire Brigade&quot; (1935), &quot;Moose Hunters&quot; (1937), &quot;Clock Cleaners&quot; (1937), &quot;Lonesome Ghosts&quot; (1937), &quot;Boat Builders&quot; (1938), and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Trailer&quot; (1938). Also during this era, Mickey was the star in &quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot; (1938), an adaptation of &quot;The Valiant Little Tailor&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award.

In 1939, Mickey appeared in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Surprise Party&quot;, along with Minnie, with a new design, which included pupils. Later on, in 1940, the character appeared in his first feature-length film, &quot;Fantasia&quot;. The film used the redesigned version of Mickey with the pupils. His screen role as The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice, set to the symphonic poem of the same name by Paul Dukas, is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of Mickey&#x27;s most iconic roles. The apprentice (Mickey), not willing to do his chores, puts on the sorcerer&#x27;s magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom, which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore—filling up a deep well using two buckets of water. When the well eventually overflows, Mickey finds himself unable to control the broom, leading to a near-flood. After the segment ends, Mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with conductor Leopold Stokowski. Mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerer&#x27;s hat in merchandising. It was also featured into the climax of Fantasmic!, an attraction at the Disney theme parks.

After 1940, Mickey&#x27;s popularity declined until his 1955 re-emergence as a daily children&#x27;s television personality. Despite this, the character continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until 1943 (winning his only competitive Academy Award—with canine companion Pluto—for the short subject &quot;Lend a Paw&quot;) and again from 1946 to 1952. In these later cartoons, Mickey was often just a supporting character in his own shorts. Pluto was instead used as the main character.

The last regular installment of the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; film series came in 1953 with &quot;The Simple Things&quot; in which Mickey and Pluto go fishing and are pestered by a flock of seagulls.

===Television and later films===
In the 1950s, Mickey became more known for his appearances on television, particularly with &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. Many of his theatrical cartoon shorts were rereleased on television series such as &quot;Ink &amp; Paint Club&quot;, various forms of the Walt Disney anthology television series, and on home video. Mickey returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; in which Mickey played Bob Cratchit. This was followed up in 1990 with &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;.

Throughout the decades, Mickey Mouse competed with Warner Bros.&#x27; Bugs Bunny for animated popularity. But in 1988, the two rivals finally shared screen time in the Robert Zemeckis Disney/Amblin film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. Disney and Warner signed an agreement stating that each character had the same amount of screen time in the scene.

Similar to his animated inclusion into a live-action film in &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot;, Mickey made a featured cameo appearance in the 1990 television special &quot;The Muppets at Walt Disney World&quot; where he met Kermit the Frog. The two are established in the story as having been old friends, although they have not made any other appearance together outside of this.

His most recent theatrical cartoon short was 2013&#x27;s &quot;Get a Horse!&quot; which was preceded by 1995&#x27;s &quot;Runaway Brain&quot;, while from 1999 to 2004, he appeared in direct-to-video features like &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;, &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot;.

Many television series have centered on Mickey, such as the ABC shows &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; (1999–2000), &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–2003), Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; (2006–2016), &quot;Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures&quot; (2017–2021) and &quot;Mickey Mouse Funhouse&quot; (2021–present). Prior to all these, Mickey was also featured as an unseen character in the &quot;Bonkers&quot; episode &quot;I Oughta Be in Toons&quot;.

In 2013, Disney Channel started airing new 3-minute &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; shorts, with animator Paul Rudish at the helm, incorporating elements of Mickey&#x27;s late twenties-early thirties look with a contemporary twist. On November 10, 2020, the series was revived as &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot; and premiered on Disney+. Furthermore, The creative team behind the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot had hoped to have Mickey Mouse in the series, but this idea was rejected by Disney executives. However, a watermelon bearing Mickey&#x27;s physical likeness appears in one episode as a ventriloquist dummy companion to Donald Duck.

In August 2018, ABC television announced a two-hour prime time special, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s 90th Spectacular&quot;, in honor of Mickey&#x27;s 90th birthday. The program featured never-before-seen short videos and several other celebrities who wanted to share their memories about Mickey Mouse and performed some of the Disney songs to impress Mickey. The show took place at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and was produced and directed by Don Mischer on November 4, 2018. On November 18, 2018, a 90th anniversary event for the character was celebrated around the world. In December 2019, both Mickey and Minnie served as special co-hosts of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; for two weeks while Vanna White served as the main host during Pat Sajak&#x27;s absence.

Mickey is the subject of the 2022 documentary film &quot;&quot;, directed by Jeff Malmberg. Premiering at the South by Southwest film festival prior to its premiere on the Disney+ streaming service, the documentary examines the history and cultural impact of Mickey Mouse. The feature is accompanied by an original, hand-drawn animated short film starring Mickey titled &quot;Mickey in a Minute&quot;.

Mickey appeared in Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; centennial short film, &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;, in which he corrals the characters of Disney&#x27;s animated features to take a group picture.

===Comics===


Mickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in 15 commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public. Walt Disney was approached by King Features Syndicate with the offer to license Mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip. Disney accepted and &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; made its first appearance on January 13, 1930. The comical plot was credited to Disney himself, art to Ub Iwerks and inking to Win Smith. The first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;. Minnie soon became the first addition to the cast. The strips first released between January 13, 1930, and March 31, 1930, have been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title &quot;Lost on a Desert Island&quot;. Animation historian Jim Korkis notes, &quot;After the eighteenth strip, Iwerks left and his inker, Win Smith, continued drawing the gag-a-day format.&quot;

In early 1930, after Iwerks&#x27; departure, Disney was at first content to continue scripting the Mickey Mouse comic strip, assigning the art to Win Smith. However, Disney&#x27;s focus had always been in animation and Smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well. Smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script, draw, and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation.

Disney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the Studio. He selected Floyd Gottfredson, a recently hired employee. At the time Gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment. Disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation. Gottfredson accepted and ended up holding this &quot;temporary&quot; assignment from May 5, 1930, to November 15, 1975.

Walt Disney&#x27;s last script for the strip appeared May 17, 1930. Gottfredson&#x27;s first task was to finish the storyline Disney had started on April 1, 1930. The storyline was completed on September 20, 1930, and later reprinted in comic book form as &quot;Mickey Mouse in Death Valley&quot;. This early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included Mickey and Minnie. Among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar, and Black Pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer Sylvester Shyster and Minnie&#x27;s uncle Mortimer Mouse. The Death Valley narrative was followed by &quot;Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers&quot;, first printed between September 22 and December 26, 1930, which introduced Marcus Mouse and his wife as Minnie&#x27;s parents.

Starting with these two early comic strip stories, Mickey&#x27;s versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other. While Disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy, the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure. This adventurous version of Mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the 20th and into the 21st century.

Floyd Gottfredson left his mark with stories such as &quot;Mickey Mouse Joins the Foreign Legion&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Gleam&quot; (1942). He also created the Phantom Blot, Eega Beeva, Morty and Ferdie, Captain Churchmouse, and Butch. Besides Gottfredson artists for the strip over the years included Roman Arambula, Rick Hoover, Manuel Gonzales, Carson Van Osten, Jim Engel, Bill Wright, Ted Thwailes and Daan Jippes; writers included Ted Osborne, Merrill De Maris, Bill Walsh, Dick Shaw, Roy Williams, Del Connell, and Floyd Norman.

The next artist to leave his mark on the character was Paul Murry in Dell Comics. His first Mickey tale appeared in 1950 but Mickey did not become a specialty until Murry&#x27;s first serial for &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; in 1953 (&quot;The Last Resort&quot;). In the same period, Romano Scarpa in Italy for the magazine &quot;Topolino&quot; began to revitalize Mickey in stories that brought back the Phantom Blot and Eega Beeva along with new creations such as the Atomo Bleep-Bleep. While the stories at Western Publishing during the Silver Age emphasized Mickey as a detective in the style of Sherlock Holmes, in the modern era several editors and creators have consciously undertaken to depict a more vigorous Mickey in the mold of the classic Gottfredson adventures. This renaissance has been spearheaded by Byron Erickson, David Gerstein, Noel Van Horn, Michael T. Gilbert and César Ferioli.

In Europe, Mickey Mouse became the main attraction of a number of comics magazines, the most famous being &quot;Topolino&quot; in Italy from 1932 onward, &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot; in France from 1934 onward, &quot;Don Miki&quot; in Spain and the Greek &quot;Miky Maous&quot;.

Mickey was the main character for the series &quot;MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine&quot;, published in Italy from 1999 to 2001.

In 2006, he appeared in the Italian fantasy comic saga &quot;Wizards of Mickey&quot;.

In 1958, Mickey Mouse was introduced to the Arab world through another comic book called &quot;Sameer&quot;. He became very popular in Egypt and got a comic book with his name. Mickey&#x27;s comics in Egypt are licensed by Disney and were published since 1959 by &quot;Dar Al-Hilal&quot; and they were successful, however Dar Al-Hilal stopped the publication in 2003 because of problems with Disney. The comics were re-released by &quot;Nahdat Masr&quot; in 2004 and the first issues were sold out in less than 8 hours.

==Portrayal==
Mickey is traditionally characterized as a sympathetic underdog who gets by on pluck and ingenuity in the face of challenges much bigger than himself. As a mouse, an inherently vulnerable creature, Mickey is often depicted as having minimal resources and attributes at his disposal. Consequently, he must rely on sheer wit to overcome obstacles. The character is frequently pitted against larger-than-life villains to accentuate this idea; namely the hulking cat Pegleg Pete, and numerous one-shot antagonists such as the giants of &quot;Giantland&quot; (1933) and &quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot; (1938), the king of cards in &quot;Thru the Mirror&quot; (1936) and Mortimer Mouse in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Rival&quot; (1936). These adversaries were decidedly portrayed as overbearing figures of authority, thusly painting Mickey as a rebellious hero. When not facing an opponent, Mickey is oft placed in situations where his pursuits of grandeur or simple accomplishment lead to disastrous results, typically at the hands of his own impulsivity, as was the case in &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1940) among others. Mickey is not portrayed as a hero in the traditional sense, instead acting as a subversion of the stock archetype. He often fumbles his way through adventures; his small size and misplaced optimism serving as his dominating flaws. His manner of problem-solving is generally unorthodox to comedic effect; in &quot;Ye Olden Days&quot; (1933), Mickey&#x27;s jousting horse was an infantile mule. In &quot;Shanghaied&quot; (1934), Mickey battled with a broadbill in place of a sword. The underdog nature of Mickey&#x27;s character has been interpreted by historians as a symbolic reflection of Walt Disney&#x27;s early struggles as a farm boy breaking into the imposing Hollywood industry in the 1920s. It has also been perceived as an allegory for the Great Depression in the United States, with Mickey&#x27;s unrelenting optimism symbolizing the &quot;American endurance to survive&quot; in the face of economic woes.

Charlie Chaplin, known by audiences of the time for his role as the &quot;Little Tramp&quot;, was identified by Disney as a source of inspiration for the Mickey character. Disney himself was a noted admirer of Chaplin&#x27;s work, ascribing his development as a storyteller to the actor. In &quot;The American Magazine&quot; for March 1931, Disney explained, &quot;I think we were rather indebted to Charlie Chaplin for the idea [of Mickey Mouse]. We wanted something appealing and we thought of a tiny bit of a mouse that would have something of the wistfulness of Chaplin... a little fellow trying to do the best he could.&quot; American journalist Alva Johnston noted the similarities between the two figures, stating, &quot;Chaplin was a kind of godfather to Mickey Mouse. It is now and always has been the aim of Disney to graft the psychology of Chaplin upon Mickey. The two universal characters have something in common in their approach to their problems. They have the same blend of hero and coward, nitwit and genius, mug and gentleman.&quot;

Besides Chaplin, other notable figures of the silent era have been credited to Mickey&#x27;s characterization. Chief among them was Douglas Fairbanks, whose swashbuckling screen adventures would inspire Mickey&#x27;s animated epics. Ub Iwerks wrote in 1970, &quot;He was the super-hero of his day, always winning, gallant and swashbuckling. Mickey&#x27;s action was in that vein. He was never intended to be a sissy, he was always an adventurous character. I thought of him in that respect, and I had him do naturally the sort of thing Doug Fairbanks would do.&quot; Disney was also noted to have been influenced by Fairbanks, along with other screen personalities including Harold Lloyd and Fred Astaire.

An adaptive character, Mickey&#x27;s personality lends itself to function within a multitude of situations, while retaining core elements of its design. He is not bound to a particular formula or motif, and as such, has been portrayed in a variety of settings and occupational roles. His film series, meanwhile, spans numerous genres besides the traditional musical comedy; &quot;The Mad Doctor&quot; (1933) and &quot;Runaway Brain&quot; (1995) parody the horror genre, whereas stories such as &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Good Deed&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1990) are largely dramatic works. This versatility is said to have attributed to Mickey&#x27;s popularity with audiences. As expressed by writer Chelsea Tatham, &quot;From his beginnings, Mickey was able to appeal to a wide audience. He catered to neither the &#x27;highbrow&#x27; nor the &#x27;hick,&#x27; but the ordinary intelligent picturegoer.&quot;

There are a number of catchphrases and colloquialisms associated with the character. Mickey&#x27;s first spoken words, &quot;Hot dog!&quot; from &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot; (1929), has endured as a recurring phrase for the character, made especially recognizable to modern audiences for its extensive use in the preschool television program &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;. Mickey&#x27;s signature closing line, &quot;See ya real soon!&quot;, is derived from the &quot;Mickey Mouse March&quot; reprise from the original 1955 run of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; (&quot;M-I-C; see you real soon!&quot;).

===Voice actors===

Composer Carl W. Stalling was the first person to provide lines for Mickey in the 1929 shorts &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot; and &quot;Wild Waves&quot;. From this point on, Mickey was voiced by Walt Disney himself, being a job in which he appeared to take great personal pride.

J. Donald Wilson and Joe Twerp provided the voice in some 1938 broadcasts of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air&quot;, although Disney remained Mickey&#x27;s official voice during this period. However, by 1946, Disney was becoming too busy with running the studio to do regular voice work which meant he could not do Mickey&#x27;s voice on a regular basis anymore. It is also speculated that his cigarette habit had damaged his voice over the years. After recording the &quot;Mickey and the Beanstalk&quot; section of &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot;, Mickey&#x27;s voice was handed over to veteran Disney musician and actor Jimmy MacDonald. Walt would reprise Mickey&#x27;s voice occasionally until his passing in 1966, such as in the introductions to the original 1955–1959 run of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; TV series, the &quot;Fourth Anniversary Show&quot; episode of the Walt Disney&#x27;s Disneyland TV series that aired on September 11, 1957, and the &quot;Disneyland USA at Radio City Music Hall&quot; show from 1962.

MacDonald voiced Mickey in most of the remaining theatrical shorts and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in 1976. However, other actors would occasionally play the role during this era. Clarence Nash, the voice of Donald Duck, provided the voice in three of Mickey&#x27;s theatrical shorts, &quot;The Dognapper&quot;, &quot;R&#x27;coon Dawg&quot;, and &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Party&quot;. Stan Freberg voiced Mickey in the Freberg-produced record &quot;Mickey Mouse&#x27;s Birthday Party&quot;.
Alan Young voiced Mickey in the Disneyland record album &quot;An Adaptation of Dickens&#x27; Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players&quot; in 1974.

The 1983 short film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; marked the theatrical debut of Wayne Allwine as Mickey Mouse, who was the official voice of Mickey from 1977 until his death in 2009, although MacDonald returned to voice Mickey for an appearance at the 50th Academy Awards in 1978. Allwine once recounted something MacDonald had told him about voicing Mickey: &quot;The main piece of advice that Jim gave me about Mickey helped me keep things in perspective. He said, &#x27;Just remember kid, you&#x27;re only filling in for the boss.&#x27; And that&#x27;s the way he treated doing Mickey for years and years. From Walt, and now from Jimmy.&quot; In 1991, Allwine married Russi Taylor, the voice of Minnie Mouse from 1986 until her death in 2019.

Les Perkins did the voice of Mickey in two TV specials, &quot;Down and Out with Donald Duck&quot; and &quot;DTV Valentine&quot;, in the mid-1980s. Peter Renaday voiced Mickey in the 1980s Disney albums &quot;Yankee Doodle Mickey&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse Splashdance&quot;. He also provided his voice for &quot;The Talking Mickey Mouse&quot; toy in 1986. Quinton Flynn briefly filled in for Allwine as the voice of Mickey in a few episodes of the first season of &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; whenever Allwine was unavailable to record.

Bret Iwan, a former Hallmark greeting card artist, has been the official voice of Mickey since 2009. Iwan was originally cast as an understudy for Allwine due to the latter&#x27;s declining health, but Allwine died before Iwan could get a chance to meet him and Iwan became the new official voice of the character at the time. Iwan&#x27;s early recordings in 2009 included work for the Disney Cruise Line, Mickey toys, the Disney theme parks and the Disney on Ice: Celebrations! ice show. He directly replaced Allwine as Mickey for the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series and the TV series &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;. His first video game voice-over of Mickey Mouse can be heard in &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep&quot;. Iwan also became the first voice actor to portray Mickey during Disney&#x27;s rebranding of the character, providing the vocal effects of Mickey in &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; as well as his voice lines in &quot;Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two&quot; and the remake of &quot;Castle of Illusion&quot;. An openly gay man, Iwan is the character&#x27;s first LGBT+ performer.

In addition to Iwan, Chris Diamantopoulos was cast as Mickey for the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; 2013 animated series developed by Paul Rudish, as the producers were looking for a voice closer to Walt Disney&#x27;s portrayal of the character in order to match the vintage look of that series. Diamantopoulos is the first voice of Mickey to be nominated for two Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards for his work in the series. He has reprised the role in the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot (in the form of a watermelon that Donald uses as a ventriloquist dummy), the Walt Disney World attraction Mickey and Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway, and the Disney+ revival of the series, &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;. He voiced Mickey once again for the 2023 short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;.

==Merchandising==
Since his early years, Mickey Mouse has been licensed by Disney to appear on many different kinds of merchandise. Mickey was produced as plush toys and figurines, and Mickey&#x27;s image has graced almost everything from T-shirts to lunchboxes. Largely responsible for early Disney merchandising was Kay Kamen, Disney&#x27;s head of merchandise and licensing from 1932 until his death in 1949, who was called a &quot;stickler for quality&quot;. Kamen was recognized by the Walt Disney Company as having a significant part in Mickey&#x27;s rise to stardom and was named a Disney Legend in 1998. At the time of his 80th-anniversary celebration in 2008, &quot;Time&quot; declared Mickey Mouse one of the world&#x27;s most recognized characters, even when compared against Santa Claus. Disney officials have stated that 98% of children aged 3–11 around the world are at least aware of the character. Disney expected the &quot;Mickey Mouse &amp; Friends&quot; brand to make $9 billion in retail sales in 2011.

===Disney parks===
As the official Walt Disney mascot, Mickey has played a central role in the Disney parks since the opening of Disneyland in 1955. As with other characters, Mickey is often portrayed by a non-speaking costumed actor. In this form, he has participated in ceremonies and countless parades, and poses for photographs with guests. As of the presidency of Barack Obama (who jokingly referred to him as &quot;a world leader who has bigger ears than me&quot;) Mickey has met every U.S. president since Harry Truman, with the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson.

Mickey also features in several specific attractions at the Disney parks. Mickey&#x27;s Toontown (Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland) is a themed land which is a recreation of Mickey&#x27;s neighborhood. Buildings are built in a cartoon style and guests can visit Mickey or Minnie&#x27;s houses, Donald Duck&#x27;s boat, or Goofy&#x27;s garage. This is a common place to meet the characters.

Mickey&#x27;s PhilharMagic (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland, Disney California Adventure) is a 4D film which features Mickey in the familiar role of symphony conductor. At Main Street Cinema several of Mickey&#x27;s short films are shown on a rotating basis; the sixth film is always &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. Mickey plays a central role in &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; (Disneyland Resort, Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios) a live nighttime show which famously features Mickey in his role as the Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice. Mickey was also a central character in the now-defunct Mickey Mouse Revue (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland) which was an indoor show featuring animatronic characters. Mickey&#x27;s face formerly graced the Mickey&#x27;s Fun Wheel (now Pixar Pal-A-Round) at Disney California Adventure Park, where a figure of him also stands on top of Silly Symphony Swings.

Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios is a trackless dark ride themed to Mickey Mouse.

In addition to Mickey&#x27;s overt presence in the parks, numerous images of him are also subtly included in sometimes unexpected places. This phenomenon is known as &quot;Hidden Mickeys&quot;, involving hidden images in Disney films, theme parks, and merchandise.

===Video games===
Mickey has starred in many video games, including &quot;Mickey Mousecapade&quot; on the Nintendo Entertainment System, &quot;Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Ultimate Challenge&quot;, and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Magical Quest&quot; on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, &quot;Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse&quot; on the Mega Drive/Genesis, &quot;Mickey Mouse: Magic Wands!&quot; on the Game Boy, and many others. In the 2000s, the &quot;Disney&#x27;s Magical Quest&quot; series were ported to the Game Boy Advance, while Mickey made his sixth generation era debut in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse&quot;, a GameCube title aimed at younger audiences. Mickey plays a major role in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, as the king of Disney Castle and aided to the protagonist, Sora and his friends. King Mickey wields the Keyblade, a weapon in the form of a key that has the power to open any lock and combat darkness. &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;, featuring a darker version of the Disney universe, was released in 2010 for the Wii. The game is part of an effort by the Walt Disney Company to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by moving away from his current squeaky clean image and reintroducing the mischievous side of his personality. Mickey Mouse is a playable character in the mobile game Disney Heroes Battle Mode.

===Watches and clock===
Mickey was famously featured on wristwatches and alarm clocks, typically utilizing his hands as the actual hands on the face of the clock. The first Mickey Mouse watches were manufactured in 1933 by the Ingersoll Watch Company. The seconds were indicated by a turning disk below Mickey. The first Mickey watch was sold at the Century of Progress in Chicago, 1933 for $3.75 (). Mickey Mouse watches have been sold by other companies and designers throughout the years, including Timex, Elgin, Helbros, Bradley, Lorus, and Gérald Genta. The fictional character Robert Langdon from Dan Brown&#x27;s novels was said to wear a Mickey Mouse watch as a reminder &quot;to stay young at heart.&quot;

===Other products===
In 1989, Milton Bradley released the electronic talking game titled &quot;Mickey Says&quot;, with three modes featuring Mickey Mouse as its host. Mickey also appeared in other toys and games, including the Worlds of Wonder released &quot;The Talking Mickey Mouse&quot;.

Fisher-Price has produced a line of talking animatronic Mickey dolls including &quot;Dance Star Mickey&quot; (2010) and &quot;Rock Star Mickey&quot; (2011).

In total, approximately 40% of Disney&#x27;s revenues for consumer products are derived from Mickey Mouse merchandise, with revenues peaking in 1997.

==Social impact==

===Use in protest votes===
In the United States, protest votes are often made in order to indicate dissatisfaction with the slate of candidates presented on a particular ballot or to highlight the inadequacies of a particular voting procedure. Since most states&#x27; electoral systems do not provide for blank balloting or a choice of &quot;None of the Above&quot;, most protest votes take the form of a clearly non-serious candidate&#x27;s name entered as a write-in vote. Mickey Mouse is often selected for this purpose. As an election supervisor in Georgia observed, &quot;If Mickey Mouse doesn&#x27;t get votes in our election, it&#x27;s a bad election.&quot; The earliest known mention of Mickey Mouse as a write-in candidate dates back to the 1932 New York City mayoral elections.

Mickey Mouse&#x27;s name has also been known to appear fraudulently on voter registration lists, such as in the 2008 U.S. presidential election.

===Pejorative use of Mickey&#x27;s name===

&quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; is a slang expression meaning small-time, amateurish or trivial. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it also means poor quality or counterfeit. In Poland the phrase &quot;mały Miki&quot;, which translates to &quot;small Mickey&quot;, means something very simple and trivial – usually used in the comparison between two things. However, in parts of Australia it can mean excellent or very good (rhyming slang for &quot;grouse&quot;). Examples of the negative usages include the following:
* From 1942 to 1945, during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, the occupying Japanese government issued a new fiat currency which drastically decreased in value towards the war. As a result of hyperinflation, Filipinos at the time would refer to the currency in scorn as &quot;Mickey Mouse money&quot;.
* In &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, Fredo&#x27;s justification of betraying Michael is that his orders in the family usually were &quot;Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo off to do that! Let Fredo take care of some Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere!&quot; as opposed to more meaningful tasks.
* In an early episode of the 1978–82 sitcom &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, Mork stated that Pluto was &quot;a Mickey Mouse planet&quot;, referring to the future dwarf planet having the same name as Mickey&#x27;s pet dog Pluto.
* On November 19, 1983, just after an ice hockey game in which Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s Edmonton Oilers beat the New Jersey Devils 13–4, Gretzky was quoted as saying to a reporter, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s time they got their act together, they&#x27;re ruining the whole league. They had better stop running a Mickey Mouse organization and put somebody on the ice&quot;. Reacting to Gretzky&#x27;s comment, Devils fans wore Mickey Mouse apparel when the Oilers returned to New Jersey on January 15, 1984, despite a 5–4 Devils loss.
* In the 1996 Warner Bros. film &quot;Space Jam&quot;, Bugs Bunny derogatorily comments on Daffy Duck&#x27;s idea for the name of their basketball team, asking: &quot;What kind of Mickey Mouse organization would name a team &#x27;The Ducks?&#x27;&quot; (This also referenced the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, an NHL team that was then owned by Disney, as well as the Disney-made &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; movie franchise. This was referencing the Disney/Warner Brothers rivalry.)
* In schools a &quot;Mickey Mouse course&quot;, &quot;Mickey Mouse major&quot;, or &quot;Mickey Mouse degree&quot; is a class, college major, or degree where very little effort is necessary in order to attain a good grade (especially an A) or one where the subject matter of such a class is not of any importance in the labor market.
* In British football, the term &quot;Mickey Mouse cup&quot; is used to describe competitions that are regarded with lesser prestige than others. It has been used to describe elimination-based season competitions like the EFL Cup or the FIFA Club World Cup, as well as single-match trophies such as the FA Community Shield or UEFA Super Cup.
* In the beginning of the 1980s, then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once called the European Parliament a &quot;Mickey Mouse parliament&quot;, meaning a discussion club without influence.
Additionally, the term &quot;Mickey Mousing&quot; refers to the exact synching of a film score to each action depicted onscreen, in reference to the early cartoons that used this technique. Although not inherently a pejorative term, the technique itself has long fallen out of fashion, and the term has taken on a secondary meaning indicating material interpreted as being too simplistic for its target audience.

===Parodies and criticism===
Mickey Mouse&#x27;s global fame has made him both a symbol of the Walt Disney Company and of the United States itself. For this reason, Mickey has been used frequently in anti-establishment or anti-American satire, such as the infamous underground cartoon &quot;Mickey Mouse in Vietnam&quot; (1969) and the Palestinian children&#x27;s propaganda series &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Pioneers&quot; where a Mickey Mouse-esque character named Farfour is used to promote Islamic extremism. There have been numerous parodies of Mickey Mouse, such as the two-page parody &quot;Mickey Rodent&quot; by Will Elder (published in &quot;Mad&quot; #19, 1955) in which the mouse walks around unshaven and jails Donald Duck out of jealousy over the duck&#x27;s larger popularity. In &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, Bart Simpson puts a black bra on his head to mimic Mickey Mouse and says: &quot;I&#x27;m the mascot of an evil corporation!&quot; &quot;The Simpsons&quot; would later become Disney property as its distributor Fox was acquired by Disney. In the Comedy Central series &quot;South Park&quot;, Mickey (voiced by Trey Parker) serves as one of the recurring antagonists, and is depicted as the sadistic, greedy, foul-mouthed boss of the Walt Disney Company, only interested in money. He also appears briefly with Donald Duck in the comic &quot;Squeak the Mouse&quot; by the Italian cartoonist Massimo Mattioli.

Mickey Mouse has also been particularly commented upon in the context of fascism and antisemitism in Nazi Germany. A pro-Nazi newspaper in the mid-1930s denounced Disney&#x27;s use of &quot;the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom&quot; as evidence of the &quot;Jewish brutalization of the people&quot;. Artist Horst Rosenthal created a comic book, &quot;Mickey au Camp de Gurs&quot; (&quot;Mickey Mouse in the Gurs Internment Camp&quot;) while detained in the Gurs internment camp, subtitled &quot;Publié Sans Autorisation de Walt Disney&quot; (&quot;Published without Walt Disney&#x27;s Permission&quot;); Rosenthal&#x27;s Mickey names Walt Disney as his father, but is sorted into the camps as a Jew after being unable to name a mother, a seeming parody of both Disney&#x27;s rumoured antisemitism and of the American public&#x27;s ignorance around racial divisions in Europe. Cartoonist Art Spiegelman adapted Nazi descriptions of Jews as rodents and vermin for his graphic novel &quot;Maus&quot;; The original three-page strip uses a young Mickey Mouse as a stand-in for Spiegelman, listening to tales of &quot;Mauschwitz&quot; and the Holocaust told by his father, Vladek. The full 1991 adaptation of the strip uses a comparatively direct anthropomorphization of Spiegelman, but otherwise continues to use Mickey Mouse imagery to connect contemporary America to the genocide.

In the 1969 parody novel &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;, Mickey Mouse is satirized as Dickey Dragon.

==Legal issues==
Although the earliest designs of Mickey Mouse entered the public domain in 2024, the character, like all major Disney characters, remains trademarked by Disney. Trademarks last for as long as it continues to be used commercially by its owner. So, while people are free to use the early designs of Mickey Mouse, due to him being trademarked, there are still limitations. For example the character cannot be referred to as &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; without permission, nor can be the early designs be used &quot;...in a way that misleads consumers into thinking your work is produced or sponsored by Disney.&quot; Between 1991 and 1998, the Walt Disney Company filed a trademark infringement complaint against the Paraguayan Mickey brand whose logo shares similarities with Mickey Mouse. Ultimately, Disney lost the case as Mickey SRL had continuously used the trademark since 1956 without prior complaint. 

Due to the Copyright Term Extension Act of the United States (sometimes called the &quot;Mickey Mouse Protection Act&quot; because of extensive lobbying by the Disney corporation) and similar legislation within the European Union and other jurisdictions where copyright terms have been extended, the early Steamboat Willie version of Mickey Mouse cartoons remained under copyright until the end of 2023. The 1928 version of Mickey entered the U.S. public domain at the start of 2024, and in 2025 the cartoons and versions of Mickey from 1929 joined them.

Copyright scholars have argued that Disney&#x27;s copyright on the earliest version of the character may have been invalid due to ambiguity in the copyright notice for &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;.

The Walt Disney Company is well known for zealously protecting its trademark on the Mickey Mouse character—whose likeness is synonymous and closely associated with the company. In 1989, Disney threatened legal action against three daycare centers in the Orlando, Florida region (where Walt Disney World is a dominant employer) for having Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters painted on their walls. The characters were removed, and the newly opened rival Universal Studios Florida allowed the centers to use their own cartoon characters with their blessing, to build community goodwill.

===&quot;Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates&quot;===
In 1971, a group of underground cartoonists calling themselves the Air Pirates, after a group of villains from early Mickey Mouse films, produced a comic called &quot;Air Pirates Funnies&quot;. In the first issue, cartoonist Dan O&#x27;Neill depicted Mickey and Minnie Mouse engaging in explicit sexual behavior and consuming drugs. As O&#x27;Neill explained, &quot;The air pirates were...some sort of bizarre concept to steal the air, pirate the air, steal the media...Since we were cartoonists, the logical thing was Disney.&quot; Rather than change the appearance or name of the character, which O&#x27;Neill felt would dilute the parody, the mouse depicted in &quot;Air Pirates Funnies&quot; looks like and is named &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;. Disney sued for copyright infringement, and after a series of appeals, O&#x27;Neill eventually lost and was ordered to pay Disney $1.9 million. The outcome of the case remains controversial among free-speech advocates. New York Law School professor Edward Samuels said, &quot;The Air Pirates set parody back twenty years.&quot;

===Copyright status===
Prior to 2024, there had been multiple attempts in the United States to argue that certain versions of Mickey Mouse were in fact in the public domain. In the 1980s, archivist George S. Brown attempted to recreate and sell cels from the 1933 short &quot;The Mad Doctor&quot;, on the theory that they were in the public domain because Disney had failed to renew the copyright as required by current law. However, Disney successfully sued Brown to prevent such sale, arguing that the lapse in copyright for &quot;The Mad Doctor&quot; did not put Mickey Mouse in the public domain because of the copyright in the earlier films. Brown attempted to appeal, noting imperfections in the earlier copyright claims, but the court dismissed his argument as untimely.

In 1999, Lauren Vanpelt, a law student at Arizona State University, wrote a paper making a similar argument. Vanpelt points out that copyright law at the time required a copyright notice specify the year of the copyright and the copyright owner&#x27;s name. The title cards to early Mickey Mouse films &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;, and &quot;Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; do not clearly identify the copyright owner, and also misidentify the copyright year. However, Vanpelt notes that copyright cards in other early films may have been done correctly, which could make Mickey Mouse &quot;protected as a component part of the larger copyrighted films&quot;.

A 2003 article by Douglas A. Hedenkamp in the &quot;Virginia Sports and Entertainment Law Journal&quot; analyzed Vanpelt&#x27;s arguments, and concluded that she is likely correct. Hedenkamp provided additional arguments, and identified some errors in Vanpelt&#x27;s paper, but still found that due to imperfections in the copyright notice on the title cards, Walt Disney forfeited his copyright in Mickey Mouse. He concluded: &quot;The forfeiture occurred at the moment of publication, and the law of that time was clear: publication without proper notice irrevocably forfeited copyright protection.&quot; Disney threatened to sue Hedenkamp for slander of title, but did not follow through. The claims in Vanpelt and Hedenkamp&#x27;s articles have not been tested in court.

In a 2023 episode of &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot;, John Oliver suggested that without copyright protection to stop the unauthorized use of Mickey Mouse, the Walt Disney Company would likely use trademark law to achieve the same results, potentially arguing that Mickey Mouse is so closely associated with their brand that any unauthorized use would cause consumer confusion. Oliver then revealed that &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot;″s opening titles had been using an image from &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; since the start of the season and that he would begin to use his own version of Mickey Mouse as a mascot of the show. He stated:

On January 1, 2024, the copyrights of the first three animated Mickey Mouse cartoons and their portrayal of Mickey Mouse expired in the United States, and they entered the public domain. They are the silent versions of the cartoons &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; and &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot;, as well as the sound cartoon &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. Newer versions of Mickey Mouse will remain copyright-protected.

Quinton Hoover, a YouTube user who uploaded a copy of &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; after its U.S. copyright expired on January 1, 2024, noted that three attempts to upload the short to the service triggered copyright claims from Disney, including one that claimed a copyright on the short&#x27;s soundtrack. Users of Twitch noted similar behavior in that attempts to stream &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; would end up with the audio muted. Disney withdrew a separate copyright strike from a different uploader shortly after it was challenged.

===Censorship===
In 1930, the German Board of Film Censors prohibited any presentations of the 1929 Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;The Barnyard Battle&quot;. The animated short, which features the mouse as a kepi-wearing soldier fighting cat enemies in German-style helmets, was viewed by censors as a negative portrayal of Germany. It was claimed by the board that the film would &quot;reawaken the latest anti-German feeling existing abroad since the War&quot;. The &quot;Barnyard Battle&quot; incident did not incite wider anti-Mickey sentiment in Germany in 1930; however, after Adolf Hitler came to power several years later, the Nazi regime unambiguously propagandized against Disney. A mid-1930s German newspaper article read:

American cartoonist and writer Art Spiegelman would later use this quote on the opening page of the second volume of his graphic novel &quot;Maus&quot;.

In 1935, Romanian authorities also banned Mickey Mouse films from cinemas, purportedly fearing that children would be &quot;scared to see a ten-foot mouse in the movie theatre&quot;. In 1938, based on the Ministry of Popular Culture&#x27;s recommendation that a reform was necessary &quot;to raise children in the firm and imperialist spirit of the Fascist revolution&quot;, the Italian Government banned foreign children&#x27;s literature except Mickey; Disney characters were exempted from the decree for the &quot;acknowledged artistic merit&quot; of Disney&#x27;s work. Actually, Mussolini&#x27;s children were fond of Mickey Mouse, so they managed to delay his ban as long as possible. In 1942, after Italy declared war on the United States, Italian publishers were forced to stop printing any Disney stories. Mickey&#x27;s stories were replaced by the adventures of &quot;Tuffolino&quot;, a new human character that looked like Mickey, created by Federico Pedrocchi (script) and Pier Lorenzo De Vita (art). After the downfall of Italy&#x27;s fascist government in 1945, the ban was removed.

==Awards and honors==

Mickey Mouse has received ten nominations for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. These are &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Orphans&quot; (1931), &quot;Building a Building&quot; (1933), &quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot; (1938), &quot;The Pointer&quot; (1939), &quot;Lend a Paw&quot; (1941), &quot;Squatter&#x27;s Rights&quot; (1946), &quot;Mickey and the Seal&quot; (1948), &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983), &quot;Runaway Brain&quot; (1995), and &quot;Get a Horse!&quot; (2013). Among these, &quot;Lend a Paw&quot; was the only film to actually win the award. Additionally, in 1932 Walt Disney received an honorary Academy Award in recognition of Mickey&#x27;s creation.

In 1994, four of Mickey&#x27;s cartoons were included in the book &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot; which listed the greatest cartoons of all time as voted by members of the animation field. The films were &quot;The Band Concert&quot; (#3), &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; (#13), &quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot; (#26), and &quot;Clock Cleaners&quot; (#27).

On November 18, 1978, in honor of his 50th anniversary, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star is located on 6925 Hollywood Blvd.

Melbourne (Australia) runs the annual Moomba festival street procession and appointed Mickey Mouse as their &quot;King of Moomba&quot; (1977). Although immensely popular with children, there was controversy with the appointment: some Melburnians wanted a &quot;home-grown&quot; choice, e.g. Blinky Bill; when it was revealed that Patricia O&#x27;Carroll (from Disneyland&#x27;s Disney on Parade show) was performing the mouse, Australian newspapers reported &quot;Mickey Mouse is really a girl!&quot;

Mickey was the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year&#x27;s Day 2005. He was the first cartoon character to receive the honor and only the second fictional character after Kermit the Frog in 1996.

<text>Meher Baba (born Merwan Sheriar Irani; 25 February 1894 – 31 January 1969) was an Indian spiritual master who said he was the Avatar, or God in human form, of the age. A spiritual figure of the 20th century, he had a following of hundreds of thousands of people, mostly in India, with a smaller number of followers in North America, Europe, South America, and Australia.

Meher Baba&#x27;s map of consciousness has been described as &quot;a unique amalgam of Sufi, Vedic, and Yogic terminology&quot;. He taught that the goal of all beings was to awaken to consciousness of their own divinity, and to realise the absolute oneness of God.

At the age of 19, Meher Baba began a seven-year period of spiritual transformation, during which he had encounters with Hazrat Babajan, Upasni Maharaj, Sai Baba of Shirdi, Tajuddin Baba, and Narayan Maharaj. In 1925, he began a 44-year period of silence, during which he communicated first using an alphabet board and by 1954 entirely through hand gestures using an interpreter. Meher Baba died on 31 January 1969 and was entombed at Meherabad. His tomb, or &quot;&quot;samadhi&quot;&quot;, has become a place of pilgrimage for his followers, often known as &quot;Baba lovers&quot;.

==Overview of teachings==
Meher Baba&#x27;s teachings concerned the nature and purpose of life. He described the phenomenal world as illusory, and taught that the Universe is imagination. He taught that God alone exists, and each soul is God passing through imagination in order to realise its own divinity. He advised followers wishing to attain God-realisation, emphasizing love and selfless-service. His other teachings included discussion of Perfect Masters, the Avatar, and those on the various stages of the spiritual path, which he termed involution. &quot;God Speaks&quot; and &quot;Discourses&quot; are regarded as among his most important written works.

For decades he declined to speak and later refrained from communicating via written language. This practice has remained a topic of discussion among some of his followers.

==Wider influence==
His legacy includes the Avatar Meher Baba Charitable Trust he established in India, and a handful of centers for information and pilgrimage. He has influenced pop culture creators and introduced the common phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t worry; be happy&quot;. This was used in Bobby McFerrin&#x27;s hit 1988 song of the same name. Among his followers were well-known musicians such as Melanie Safka and Pete Townshend, as well as journalists including Sir Tom Hopkinson.

In 1971, Meher Baba&#x27;s following in the United States was estimated at 7,000. Some commentators have suggested that the size of the movement has been underestimated due to the rarity of proselytising by Meher Baba&#x27;s followers, and that in 1975, the movement was larger than the more visible Hare Krishna movement.

Meher Baba was accepted as the leader of a Sufi organization based in California which he renamed Sufism Reoriented. Meher Baba&#x27;s Sufi influence is said to have drawn from Sai Baba of Shirdi, whom Meher Baba designated as a &quot;Qutb&quot;. However, some commentators have asserted that Meher Baba&#x27;s interpretation of Sufism shared very few similarities with the Sufi Movement apart from universalism and anti-dogmatism.

== Life and works ==
===Early life===

Meher Baba was born to Irani Zoroastrian parents in 1894 in Pune, India (formerly Poona). He was named Merwan Sheriar Irani, the second son of Sheriar Irani and Shireen Irani. Sheriar Irani was a Persian Zoroastrian from Khorramshahr who had spent years wandering in search of spiritual experiences before settling in Pune.

As a boy, Baba formed the Cosmopolitan Club, which was dedicated to remaining informed on world affairs and donating money to charity. He was a multi-instrumentalist and poet. Fluent in several languages, he was fond of the poetry of Hafez, William Shakespeare, and Percy Bysshe Shelley.

His spiritual transformation began when he was 19 years old and lasted for seven years. At 19, he met Hazrat Babajan, an elderly Muslim saint. He was cycling past a tree that she had made her abode, when she called to him. When he approached her, she kissed him on the forehead, causing him to enter a nine month-long trance which he described as &quot;divine bliss&quot;, with a lack of consciousness of his body. Babajan predicted that he would become a spiritual leader. He then encountered Upasni Maharaj, who he later said helped him to integrate his mystical experiences with ordinary consciousness, thus enabling him to function in the world without diminishing his experience of God-realisation.

Over the next several years, he encountered other spiritual figures, namely Tajuddin Baba, Narayan Maharaj, and Sai Baba of Shirdi, who, along with Babajan and Upasni Maharaj, Baba later said were the five &quot;Perfect Masters&quot; of the age. By early 1922, at the age of 27, Baba began gathering his own disciples. They gave him the name &quot;Meher Baba&quot;, which means &quot;compassionate father&quot;.

In 1922, Meher Baba and his followers established Manzil-e-Meem (House of the Master) in Mumbai. There, Baba commenced his practice of demanding strict discipline and obedience from his disciples. A year later, Baba and his mandali moved to an area a few miles outside Ahmednagar that he named Meherabad (Garden of Blessing). This ashram would become the center for his work. During the 1920s, Meher Baba opened a school, hospital, and dispensary at Meherabad, all of which were free and open to all castes and faiths.

From 10 July 1925 until the end of his life, Meher Baba maintained silence. He now communicated first through chalk and slate, then by an alphabet board, and later via a repertoire of gestures unique to him. On 1 December 1926, he wrote his last message, and began relying on an alphabet board. With his &quot;mandali&quot; (circle of disciples), he spent long periods in seclusion, during which time he often fasted. He also traveled widely, held public gatherings, and engaged in works of charity with lepers and the poor.

===1930-1939 – First contact with the West===
Beginning in 1931, Meher Baba made the first of many visits to the West. Throughout that decade, Meher Baba began a period of world travel and took several trips to Europe and the United States. It was during this period that he established contact with his first close group of Western disciples. He traveled on a Persian passport, as he had given up writing, as well as speaking, and would not sign the forms required by the British government of India. Here, he attracted more followers.

On his first trip to England in 1931, he traveled on the &quot;SS Rajputana&quot;, at the same time as Mahatma Gandhi, who was sailing to the second Round Table Conference in London. Baba and Gandhi met three times on board. One of these exchanges lasted for three hours. The British press publicized these meetings, but an aide to Gandhi said, &quot;You may say emphatically that Gandhi never asked Meher Baba for help or for spiritual or other advice.&quot;

In the West, Meher Baba met with a number of celebrities and artists, including Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, Tallulah Bankhead, Boris Karloff, Tom Mix, Maurice Chevalier, and Ernst Lubitsch. On 1 June 1932, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. held a reception for Baba at Pickfair at which he delivered a message to Hollywood. As a result, says Robert S. Ellwood, Meher Baba emerged as &quot;one of the enthusiasms of the &#x27;30s&quot;.

In 1934, after announcing that he would break his self-imposed silence in the Hollywood Bowl, Baba changed his plans abruptly, boarded the RMS &quot;Empress of Canada&quot;, and sailed to Hong Kong without explanation. The Associated Press reported that &quot;Baba had decided to postpone the word-fast-breaking until next February because &#x27;conditions are not yet ripe&#x27;.&quot; He returned to England in 1936 but did not return to the United States again until the early 1950s.

In the late 1930s, Meher Baba invited a group of Western women to join him in India, where he arranged a series of trips throughout India and British Ceylon that became known as the Blue Bus Tours. When the tour returned home, many newspapers treated their journey as an occasion for scandal. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1936 review of &quot;God Is My Adventure&quot; describes the US&#x27;s fascination with the &quot;long-haired, silky-mustached Parsee named Shri Sadgaru [sic] Meher Baba&quot; four years earlier.

=== 1940-1949 – Masts and the New Life ===
In the 1930s and 1940s, Meher Baba worked with masts, or those &quot;intoxicated with God&quot;. According to Baba, these individuals are disabled by their enchanting experience of the higher spiritual planes. Although outwardly masts may appear irrational or insane, Baba claimed that their spiritual status was elevated, and that by meeting with them he helped them to progress spiritually while enlisting their aid in his spiritual work. One of these masts, Mohammed, lived at Meher Baba&#x27;s encampment at Meherabad until his death in 2003.

During his journey in 1946, Meher Baba went to Sehwan Sharif to meet a Sufi saint and descendant of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, Murshid Nadir Ali Shah, whom Baba referred to as an advanced pilgrim.

In 1949, Baba began a period that he called the New Life. Following a series of questions on their readiness to obey even the most difficult of his requests, Baba selected twenty companions to join him in a life of complete &quot;hopelessness and helplessness&quot;.

He made provisions for those dependent on him, after which he and his companions otherwise gave up nearly all property and financial responsibilities. They traveled around India incognito while begging for food and carrying out Baba&#x27;s instructions in accordance with a strict set of &quot;conditions of the New Life&quot;. These included acceptance of any circumstance and consistent good cheer in the face of any difficulty. Companions who failed to comply were sent away.

Concerning the New Life, Meher Baba wrote:

Meher Baba ended the New Life in February 1952 and once again began a round of public appearances throughout India and the West.

=== 1950-1959 – &quot;God Speaks&quot; and automobile accidents ===
After being injured as a passenger in two serious automobile accidents, one near Prague, Oklahoma in the United States in 1952, and one in India in 1956, Meher Baba&#x27;s ability to walk became limited.

In the 1950s, Baba established two centers outside of India, namely the Meher Spiritual Center in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in the United States and Avatar&#x27;s Abode near Brisbane, Australia. He inaugurated the Meher Spiritual Center in April 1952. On 24 May 1952, en route from the Meher Spiritual Center to Meher Mount in Ojai, California, the car in which he was a passenger was struck head-on near Prague, Oklahoma. He and his companions were thrown from the vehicle and injured. Baba&#x27;s leg was severely broken and he sustained facial injuries including a broken nose. The injured were treated at Prague Memorial Hospital, after which they returned to Myrtle Beach to recuperate. While recuperating at Youpon Dunes, a home owned by Elizabeth Patterson, he worked on the charter for a group of Sufis, which he named Sufism Reoriented.

Meher Baba began dictating his major book, &quot;God Speaks, The Theme of Creation and Its Purpose&quot;, using an alphabet board in Dehradun, in August 1953. He dedicated this book &quot;To the the Illusion that sustains Reality&quot;. In September 1954, Meher Baba gave a men-only sahavas at Meherabad that later became known as the Three Incredible Weeks. During this time Baba issued a declaration, &quot;Meher Baba&#x27;s Call&quot;, wherein he once again affirmed his Avatarhood &quot;irrespective of the doubts and convictions&quot; of others. At the end of this sahavas, Meher Baba gave the completed manuscript of his book &quot;God Speaks&quot; to two members of Sufism Reoriented, Ludwig H. Dimpfl and Don E. Stevens, for editing and publication in America. The book was published by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year.

On 30 September 1954 Meher Baba gave his Final Declaration message.

In October 1954, Meher Baba discarded his alphabet board and began using a unique set of hand gestures to communicate, which he used for the rest of his life.

On 2 December 1956, outside Satara, India, the car in which Meher Baba was riding lost control and a second serious automobile accident occurred. Baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. Nilu, one of Baba&#x27;s mandali, was killed. This collision seriously incapacitated Baba. Despite his physicians&#x27; predictions, Baba began to walk again, but from that point was in constant pain and had limited mobility. During his trip to the West in 1958, he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.

In 1956, during his fifth visit to the United States, Baba stayed at New York&#x27;s Hotel Delmonico before traveling to the Meher Spiritual Center at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In July he traveled to Washington, D.C., and received friends and disciples at the home of Ivy Duce, wife of James Terry Duce, the vice-president of the Arabian American Oil Company. He then traveled to Meher Mount at Ojai, California before proceeding to Australia. His final visits to the United States and Australia were made in 1958.

=== 1960-1969 – Final years and death ===
In 1962, Baba held one of his last public functions, a mass meeting in India called the East-West Gathering. At these meetings, at which his Western followers were invited to meet his Indian disciples, Baba gave darshan to many thousands, despite the physical strain this caused him. Despite deteriorating health, he continued what he called his &quot;Universal Work&quot;, which included fasting and seclusion, until his death on 31 January 1969. His &quot;samadhi&quot; in Meherabad, India, has become a place of international pilgrimage. In the mid-1960s Baba became concerned with the drug culture in the West and began correspondences with several Western academics, including Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, in which he discouraged the use of hallucinogenic drugs for spiritual purposes. In 1966, Baba&#x27;s responses to questions on drugs were published in a pamphlet titled &quot;God in a Pill?&quot; Meher Baba stated that drug use was spiritually damaging and that if enlightenment were possible through drugs then &quot;God is not worthy of being God&quot;. Meher Baba instructed his young Western disciples to spread this message; in doing so, they increased awareness of Meher Baba&#x27;s teachings. In an interview with Frederick Chapman, a Harvard graduate and Fulbright scholar who met Meher Baba during a year of study in India, Baba described LSD as &quot;harmful physically, mentally, and spiritually&quot; and warned that &quot;[its continued use] leads to madness or death&quot;. Baba lovers in the United States, Europe, and Australia initiated an anti-drug campaign during this period. Though some contend that this campaign was mostly futile, it attracted new followers to Meher Baba. Furthermore, some of Baba&#x27;s views entered into academic debate on the merits and dangers of hallucinogens.

From the East-West Gathering of 1962 onward, Meher Baba&#x27;s health deteriorated. Despite the physical toll it took on his body, he continued to undergo periods of seclusion and fasting. In late July 1968, Baba stated that he had completed a particularly taxing period of seclusion and noted that his work was &quot;completed 100% to my satisfaction&quot;. He was by then using a wheelchair. Within a few months, his condition had worsened and he was bedridden, wracked by muscle spasms without clear medical origin. Despite the care of several physicians, the spasms worsened. On 31 January 1969, Meher Baba woke up in the morning. He had a few pieces of papaya. At 12:15p.m. he died at 74 years of age after a violent spasm wracked his body. He conveyed by his last gestures, &quot;Do not forget that I am God.&quot; In time, his devotees called the anniversary of his death &quot;Amartithi&quot; (deathless day). Meher Baba&#x27;s body was placed at his samadhi at Meherabad, covered with roses and cooled by ice. His body was kept available to the public for one week before its final burial. Prior to his death, Meher Baba had made extensive preparations for a public darshan program to be held in Pune. His mandali decided to proceed with the arrangements despite the absence of the host. Several thousand attended this &quot;Last Darshan&quot;, including many hundreds from the United States, Europe, and Australia.

==Silence==
From 10 July 1925, until his death in 1969, Meher Baba was silent. He communicated first by using an alphabet board and later by unique hand gestures which were interpreted and spoken out by one of his mandali, often Eruch Jessawala. Meher Baba said that his silence was not undertaken as a spiritual exercise but solely in connection with his universal work.

Meher Baba often signaled the moment &quot;that he would &#x27;break&#x27; his silence by speaking the &#x27;Word&#x27; in every heart, thereby giving a spiritual push forward to all living things&quot;.

Meher Baba asserted that the breaking of his silence would be a defining event in the spiritual evolution of the world.

On many occasions Meher Baba promised to break his silence with an audible word before he died, often stating a specific time and place when this would occur, but according to all contemporary accounts, Meher Baba remained silent until his death. His failure to break his silence disappointed some of his followers, while others viewed it as a test of their faith. Some of his followers speculate that &quot;the Word&quot; will yet be &quot;spoken&quot; or that Meher Baba broke his silence in a spiritual rather than a physical way.

For many years Meher Baba asked his followers to undertake austerities on 10 July, the anniversary of the day his silence began, such as keeping silence, fasting, and praying. In his final Silence Day request to his followers in 1968, he asked only that they keep silent. Many followers continue to celebrate Silence Day by keeping silence in his honor.

==Teachings==
Meher Baba&#x27;s teachings can be divided into two main categories: his metaphysics on the nature of the soul and the Universe, and practical advice for the spiritual aspirant. The two are interrelated. His metaphysics is mostly found in his principal book on the subject, &quot;God Speaks&quot;. It contains detailed statements on his cosmology, the purpose of life, and the progression of the soul. His teachings on the practical spiritual life are mostly contained in the &quot;Discourses&quot;, although it also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring or amplifying &quot;God Speaks&quot;.

===&quot;God Speaks&quot;===
&quot;God Speaks&quot; describes the journey of the soul from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate attainment of conscious divinity. The whole journey is a journey of imagination, in which the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualised souls which he likens to bubbles within an infinite ocean. Each soul, powered by the desire to become conscious, starts its journey in the most rudimentary form of consciousness. This limitation brings the need of a more developed form to advance it towards an increasingly conscious state. Consciousness grows in relation to the impressions each form is capable of gathering.

According to Meher Baba, each soul pursues conscious divinity by evolving; that is, experiencing itself in a succession of imagined forms through seven &quot;kingdoms&quot; of stone/metal, vegetable, worm, fish, bird, animal, and human. The soul identifies itself with each successive form, becoming thus tied to illusion. During this evolution of forms, the power of thought increases, until in human form thought becomes infinite. Although in human form, the soul is capable of conscious divinity, all the impressions that it has gathered during evolution are illusory ones that create a barrier against the soul knowing itself. For this barrier to be overcome, further births in human form are needed in a process known as reincarnation.

The soul will reach a stage where its previously gathered impressions grow thin or weak enough that it enters a final stage called involution. This stage also requires a series of human births, during which the soul begins an inner journey, by which it realises its true identity as God. Baba breaks this inner journey into seven stages he called &quot;planes&quot;. The process culminates, at the seventh plane, with God-realisation, at which the goal of life for the soul is reached.

===&quot;Discourses&quot;===
The &quot;Discourses&quot; are a collection of explanations that Meher Baba has given on topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. These topics include: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle of illusion), the nature of the ego, reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realisation. His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, shows how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.

Meher Baba&#x27;s suggestions include putting theory into practice, internally renouncing desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, and avoiding actions that bind one to illusion. Rather than lay out moral rules, Baba explains why some actions bind the individual whereas others aid emancipation. Several chapters discuss the mechanisms by which consciousness gets caught up between the opposites of experience, such as pleasure and pain, good and evil, and suggest how to transcend these opposites.

=== Perfect Masters and the Avatar ===
Meher Baba related that there are 56 incarnate God-realised souls on Earth at any given time. Of these souls there are always five who constitute the five Perfect Masters of their era. When one of the five Perfect Masters dies, another God-realised soul immediately replaces him or her.

The Avatar, according to Baba, is a special Perfect Master, the first soul to achieve God-realisation. This soul, the original Perfect Master, or Ancient One, never ceases to incarnate. Baba indicated that this soul personifies the state of God called Vishnu in Hinduism and Parvardigar in Sufism, i.e. the sustainer or preserver state of God. Baba taught that the Avatar appears on Earth every 700–1400 years and is &quot;brought down&quot; into human form by the five Perfect Masters of the time to aid creation in the endless process of moving toward Godhood. Baba claimed that in other ages this role had been fulfilled by Zoroaster, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad.

Baba described the Avatar as &quot;a gauge against which man can measure what he is and what he may become. He trues the standard of human values by interpreting them in terms of divinely human life.&quot;

Most of Meher Baba&#x27;s followers accept his claim of avatarhood, and he is said to be &quot;revered by millions around the world as the Avatar of the age and a God-realized being&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Meher Baba&#x27;s travels and teachings left a legacy of followers and devotees worldwide.

The Avatar Meher Baba Charitable Trust, established by Meher Baba in 1959, maintains his tomb and pilgrimage facilities, as well as a free school and dispensary, a cataract clinic, and a veterinary clinic. The Trust follows the charter Meher Baba left for it, but does not act as spiritual authority over groups. Likewise, the Trust does not engage in propaganda, promote creeds or dogmas, or seek converts. Baba discouraged evangelizing, stating, &quot;I need no propaganda or publicity.&quot; Rather, he encouraged his followers to &quot;let your life itself be my message of love and truth to others&quot; and to &quot;spread my message of Love and Truth as far and wide as possible&quot;. Though some followers of Meher Baba have no established rituals, others perform practices such as pujas, aartis, prayers, music, plays, and viewing films of Baba. The primary focus for many followers is living as Meher Baba would approve, such as by abstaining from marijuana and psychedelic drugs, and trying to remember God with love.

Gatherings of Baba followers are generally informal. Special effort is made to gather together on Amartithi, the anniversary of Baba&#x27;s death, and on his birthday. Many Baba followers keep silent on 10 July (Silence Day), observing the request Baba frequently made of his followers during his lifetime. Aarti is performed morning and evening at Baba&#x27;s samadhi in India. At Meherabad, his followers maintain Baba&#x27;s practice of lighting a dhuni fire on the 12th of each month.

==In popular culture==
Meher Baba had gained public attention in the West as early as 1932, due to contacts with celebrities of the time, and from the rather disillusioned account of Paul Brunton in his &quot;A Search in Secret India&quot; (1934). Baba received further attention posthumously via various mentions in Western pop-culture.

For example, Pete Townshend of the Who, became a follower of Baba and dedicated his 1969 rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot; to him in the gatefold. The Who&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; was named in part after Meher Baba, and Townshend recorded several Meher Baba tribute albums and music videos including &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, &quot;I Am&quot;, &quot;Who Came First&quot;, &quot;With Love&quot;, and &quot;You Alone Exist&quot;.

In 1969, Indian filmmaker Jagat Murari co-produced the ethnographic film on Meher Baba titled &quot;The Awakener&quot;. The 35-millimeter, 118 minute found footage film was distributed by Films Division of India.

In 1970, Melanie Safka (stage name &quot;Melanie&quot;) mentioned Baba in the spoken word intro to her song &quot;Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)&quot;. Listed as a standalone piece entitled &quot;Candles in the Rain&quot;, the lyrics are &quot;Meher Baba lives again&quot;. Bobby McFerrin&#x27;s 1988 Grammy Award–winning song &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, Be Happy&quot; was inspired by Baba&#x27;s adage, which has appeared on many posters and inspirational cards depicting him.

Various Indian films produced by Edida Nageswara Rao have depicted Meher Baba&#x27;s images. Works such as &quot;Swathi Kiranam&quot; (1992) were exclusively filmed at the Meher Baba center in Tapeswaram, Andhra Pradesh, depicting life size images of Meher Baba.

Elements of Meher Baba&#x27;s philosophy, as well as an unnamed character based upon him, have appeared in the works of comic book writer and screenwriter J. M. DeMatteis. Works particularly influenced by Baba include DeMatteis&#x27; scripts for &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; and DeMatteis creator-owned comic book &quot;Seekers into the Mystery&quot;. &quot;The Theme of Creation&quot; (2005) was an American documentary film produced, written, edited and directed by Tim Thelen.

In 2012, the feature film &quot;Nema Aviona za Zagreb&quot; premiered in the Netherlands with an exclusive interview with Meher Baba filmed in 1967. In the interview, Baba explains the difference between God-realisation and drug-induced hallucinations and the scene plays a pivotal role in the documentary&#x27;s narrative.

&quot;THE VISA – A Meher Baba film&quot; was produced by Sufism Reoriented&#x27;s American Young Adult Sahavas team in 2018, and stars followers of Meher Baba such as Natasha K. Mehta. Meher Filmworks produces and archives remastered film footage of Meher Baba.

<text>The cavity magnetron is a high-power vacuum tube used in early radar systems and subsequently in microwave ovens and in linear particle accelerators. A cavity magnetron generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field, while moving past a series of cavity resonators, which are small, open cavities in a metal block. Electrons pass by the cavities and cause microwaves to oscillate within, similar to the functioning of a whistle producing a tone when excited by an air stream blown past its opening. The resonant frequency of the arrangement is determined by the cavities&#x27; physical dimensions. Unlike other vacuum tubes, such as a klystron or a traveling-wave tube (TWT), the magnetron cannot function as an amplifier for increasing the intensity of an applied microwave signal; the magnetron serves solely as an electronic oscillator generating a microwave signal from direct current electricity supplied to the vacuum tube.

The use of magnetic fields as a means to control the flow of an electric current was spurred by the invention of the Audion by Lee de Forest in 1906. Albert Hull of General Electric Research Laboratory, USA, began development of magnetrons to avoid de Forest&#x27;s patents, but these were never completely successful. Other experimenters picked up on Hull&#x27;s work and a key advance, the use of two cathodes, was introduced by Habann in Germany in 1924. Further research was limited until Okabe&#x27;s 1929 Japanese paper noting the production of centimeter-wavelength signals, which led to worldwide interest. The development of magnetrons with multiple cathodes was proposed by A. L. Samuel of Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1934, leading to designs by Postumus in 1934 and Hans Hollmann in 1935. Production was taken up by Philips, General Electric Company (GEC), Telefunken and others, limited to perhaps 10 W output. By this time the klystron was producing more power and the magnetron was not widely used, although a 300 W device was built by Aleksereff and Malearoff in the USSR in 1936 (published in 1940).

The &quot;cavity&quot; magnetron was a radical improvement introduced by John Randall and Harry Boot at the University of Birmingham, England in 1940. Their first working example produced hundreds of watts at 10 cm wavelength, an unprecedented achievement. Within weeks, engineers at GEC had improved this to well over a kilowatt (kW), and within months 25 kW, over 100 kW by 1941 and pushing towards a megawatt by 1943. The high power pulses were generated from a device the size of a small book and transmitted from an antenna only centimeters long, reducing the size of practical radar systems by orders of magnitude. New radars appeared for night-fighters, anti-submarine aircraft and even the smallest escort ships, and from that point on the Allies of World War II held a lead in radar that their counterparts in Germany and Japan were never able to close. By the end of the war, practically every Allied radar was based on the magnetron.

The magnetron continued to be used in radar in the post-war period but fell from favour in the 1960s as high-power klystrons and traveling-wave tubes emerged. A key characteristic of the magnetron is that its output signal changes from pulse to pulse, both in frequency and phase. This renders it less suitable for pulse-to-pulse comparisons for performing moving target indication and removing &quot;clutter&quot; from the radar display. The magnetron remains in use in some radar systems, but has become much more common as a low-cost source for microwave ovens. In this form, over one billion magnetrons are in use today.

==Construction and operation==
===Conventional tube design===
In a conventional electron tube (vacuum tube), electrons are emitted from a negatively charged, heated component called the cathode and are attracted to a positively charged component called the anode. The components are normally arranged concentrically, placed within a tubular-shaped container from which all air has been evacuated, so that the electrons can move freely (hence the name &quot;vacuum&quot; tubes, called &quot;valves&quot; in British English).

If a third electrode (called a control grid) is inserted between the cathode and the anode, the flow of electrons between the cathode and anode can be regulated by varying the voltage on this third electrode. This allows the resulting electron tube (called a &quot;triode&quot; because it now has three electrodes) to function as an amplifier because small variations in the electric charge applied to the control grid will result in identical variations in the much larger current of electrons flowing between the cathode and anode.

===Hull or single-anode magnetron===
The idea of using a grid for control was invented by Philipp Lenard, who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1905. In the USA it was later patented by Lee de Forest, resulting in considerable research into alternate tube designs that would avoid his patents. One concept used a magnetic field instead of an electrical charge to control current flow, leading to the development of the magnetron tube. In this design, the tube was made with two electrodes, typically with the cathode in the form of a metal rod in the center, and the anode as a cylinder around it. The tube was placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet arranged such that the magnetic field was aligned parallel to the axis of the electrodes.

With no magnetic field present, the tube operates as a diode, with electrons flowing directly from the cathode to the anode. In the presence of the magnetic field, the electrons will experience a force at right angles to their direction of motion (the Lorentz force). In this case, the electrons follow a curved path between the cathode and anode. The curvature of the path can be controlled by varying either the magnetic field using an electromagnet, or by changing the electrical potential between the electrodes.

At very high magnetic field settings the electrons are forced back onto the cathode, preventing current flow. At the opposite extreme, with no field, the electrons are free to flow straight from the cathode to the anode. There is a point between the two extremes, the critical value or Hull cut-off magnetic field (and cut-off voltage), where the electrons just reach the anode. At fields around this point, the device operates similar to a triode. However, magnetic control, due to hysteresis and other effects, results in a slower and less faithful response to control current than electrostatic control using a control grid in a conventional triode (not to mention greater weight and complexity), so magnetrons saw limited use in conventional electronic designs.

It was noticed that when the magnetron was operating at the critical value, it would emit energy in the radio frequency spectrum. This occurs because a few of the electrons, instead of reaching the anode, continue to circle in the space between the cathode and the anode. Due to an effect now known as cyclotron radiation, these electrons radiate radio frequency energy. The effect is not very efficient. Eventually the electrons hit one of the electrodes, so the number in the circulating state at any given time is a small percentage of the overall current. It was also noticed that the frequency of the radiation depends on the size of the tube, and even early examples were built that produced signals in the microwave regime.

Early conventional tube systems were limited to the high frequency bands, and although very high frequency systems became widely available in the late 1930s, the ultra high frequency and microwave bands were well beyond the ability of conventional circuits. The magnetron was one of the few devices able to generate signals in the microwave band and it was the only one that was able to produce high power at centimeter wavelengths.

===Split-anode magnetron===

The original magnetron was very difficult to keep operating at the critical value, and even then the number of electrons in the circling state at any time was fairly low. This meant that it produced very low-power signals. Nevertheless, as one of the few devices known to create microwaves, interest in the device and potential improvements was widespread.

The first major improvement was the split-anode magnetron, also known as a negative-resistance magnetron. As the name implies, this design used an anode that was split in two—one at each end of the tube—creating two half-cylinders. When both were charged to the same voltage the system worked like the original model. But by slightly altering the voltage of the two plates, the electrons&#x27; trajectory could be modified so that they would naturally travel towards the lower voltage side. The plates were connected to an oscillator that reversed the relative voltage of the two plates at a given frequency.

At any given instant, the electron will naturally be pushed towards the lower-voltage side of the tube. The electron will then oscillate back and forth as the voltage changes. At the same time, a strong magnetic field is applied, stronger than the critical value in the original design. This would normally cause the electron to circle back to the cathode, but due to the oscillating electrical field, the electron instead follows a looping path that continues toward the anodes.

Since all of the electrons in the flow experienced this looping motion, the amount of RF energy being radiated was greatly improved. And as the motion occurred at any field level beyond the critical value, it was no longer necessary to carefully tune the fields and voltages, and the overall stability of the device was greatly improved. Unfortunately, the higher field also meant that electrons often circled back to the cathode, depositing their energy on it and causing it to heat up. As this normally causes more electrons to be released, it could sometimes lead to a runaway effect, damaging the device.

===Cavity magnetron===
The great advance in magnetron design was the resonant cavity magnetron or electron-resonance magnetron, which works on entirely different principles. In this design the oscillation is created by the physical shape of the anode, rather than external circuits or fields.


Mechanically, the cavity magnetron consists of a large, solid cylinder of metal with a hole drilled through the centre of the circular face. A wire acting as the cathode is run down the center of this hole, and the metal block itself forms the anode. Around this hole, known as the &quot;interaction space&quot;, are a number of similar holes (&quot;resonators&quot;) drilled parallel to the interaction space, connected to the interaction space by a short channel. The resulting block looks something like the cylinder on a revolver, with a somewhat larger central hole. Early models were cut using Colt pistol jigs. Remembering that in an AC circuit the electrons travel along the surface, not the core, of the conductor, the parallel sides of the slot act as a capacitor while the round holes form an inductor: an LC circuit made of solid copper, with the resonant frequency defined entirely by its dimensions.

The magnetic field is set to a value well below the critical, so the electrons follow curved paths towards the anode. When they strike the anode, they cause it to become negatively charged in that region. As this process is random, some areas will become more or less charged than the areas around them. The anode is constructed of a highly conductive material, almost always copper, so these differences in voltage cause currents to appear to even them out. Since the current has to flow around the outside of the cavity, this process takes time. During that time additional electrons will avoid the hot spots and be deposited further along the anode, as the additional current flowing around it arrives too. This causes an oscillating current to form as the current tries to equalize one spot, then another.

The oscillating currents flowing around the cavities, and their effect on the electron flow within the tube, cause large amounts of microwave radiofrequency energy to be generated in the cavities. The cavities are open on one end, so the entire mechanism forms a single, larger, microwave oscillator. A &quot;tap&quot;, normally a wire formed into a loop, extracts microwave energy from one of the cavities. In some systems the tap wire is replaced by an open hole, which allows the microwaves to flow into a waveguide.

As the oscillation takes some time to set up, and is inherently random at the start, subsequent startups will have different output parameters. Phase is almost never preserved, which makes the magnetron difficult to use in phased array systems. Frequency also drifts from pulse to pulse, a more difficult problem for a wider array of radar systems. Neither of these present a problem for continuous-wave radars, nor for microwave ovens.

==Common features==

All cavity magnetrons consist of a heated cylindrical cathode at a high (continuous or pulsed) negative potential created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode is placed in the center of an evacuated, lobed, circular metal chamber. The walls of the chamber are the anode of the tube. A magnetic field parallel to the axis of the cavity is imposed by a permanent magnet. The electrons initially move radially outward from the cathode attracted by the electric field of the anode walls. The magnetic field causes the electrons to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the Lorentz force. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut along the length of the cavities that open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each resonant cavity, which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. A portion of the radio frequency energy is extracted by a short coupling loop that is connected to a waveguide (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high-gain antenna in the case of radar.

The size of the cavities determine the resonant frequency, and thereby the frequency of the emitted microwaves. However, the frequency is not precisely controllable. The operating frequency varies with changes in load impedance, with changes in the supply current, and with the temperature of the tube. This is not a problem in uses such as heating, or in some forms of radar where the receiver can be synchronized with an imprecise magnetron frequency. Where precise frequencies are needed, other devices, such as the klystron are used.

The magnetron is a self-oscillating device requiring no external elements other than a power supply. A well-defined threshold anode voltage must be applied before oscillation will build up; this voltage is a function of the dimensions of the resonant cavity, and the applied magnetic field. In pulsed applications there is a delay of several cycles before the oscillator achieves full peak power, and the build-up of anode voltage must be coordinated with the build-up of oscillator output.

Where there are an even number of cavities, two concentric rings can connect alternate cavity walls to prevent inefficient modes of oscillation. This is called pi-strapping because the two straps lock the phase difference between adjacent cavities at π radians (180°).

The modern magnetron is a fairly efficient device. In a microwave oven, for instance, a 1.1-kilowatt input will generally create about 700 watts of microwave power, an efficiency of around 65%. (The high-voltage and the properties of the cathode determine the power of a magnetron.) Large S band magnetrons can produce up to 2.5 megawatts peak power with an average power of 3.75 kW. Some large magnetrons are water cooled. The magnetron remains in widespread use in roles which require high power, but where precise control over frequency and phase is unimportant.
==Applications==
===Radar===


In a radar set, the magnetron&#x27;s waveguide is connected to an antenna. The magnetron is operated with very short pulses of applied voltage, resulting in a short pulse of high-power microwave energy being radiated. As in all primary radar systems, the radiation reflected from a target is analyzed to produce a radar map on a screen.

Several characteristics of the magnetron&#x27;s output make radar use of the device somewhat problematic. The first of these factors is the magnetron&#x27;s inherent instability in its transmitter frequency. This instability results not only in frequency shifts from one pulse to the next, but also a frequency shift within an individual transmitted pulse. The second factor is that the energy of the transmitted pulse is spread over a relatively wide frequency spectrum, which requires the receiver to have a correspondingly wide bandwidth. This wide bandwidth allows ambient electrical noise to be accepted into the receiver, thus obscuring somewhat the weak radar echoes, thereby reducing overall receiver signal-to-noise ratio and thus performance. The third factor, depending on application, is the radiation hazard caused by the use of high-power electromagnetic radiation. In some applications, for example, a marine radar mounted on a recreational vessel, a radar with a magnetron output of 2 to 4 kilowatts is often found mounted very near an area occupied by crew or passengers. In practical use these factors have been overcome, or merely accepted, and there are today thousands of magnetron aviation and marine radar units in service. Recent advances in aviation weather-avoidance radar and in marine radar have successfully replaced the magnetron with microwave semiconductor oscillators, which have a narrower output frequency range. These allow a narrower receiver bandwidth to be used, and the higher signal-to-noise ratio in turn allows a lower transmitter power, reducing exposure to EMR.

===Heating===

In microwave ovens, the waveguide leads to a radio-frequency-transparent port into the cooking chamber. As the fixed dimensions of the chamber and its physical closeness to the magnetron would normally create standing wave patterns in the chamber, the pattern is randomized by a motorized fan-like &quot;mode stirrer&quot; in the waveguide (more often in commercial ovens), or by a turntable that rotates the food (most common in consumer ovens).
An early example of this application was when British scientists in 1954 used a microwave oven to resurrect cryogenically frozen hamsters.

===Lighting===
In microwave-excited lighting systems, such as a sulfur lamp, a magnetron provides the microwave field that is passed through a waveguide to the lighting cavity containing the light-emitting substance (e.g., sulfur, metal halides, etc.). Although efficient, these lamps are much more complex than other methods of lighting and therefore not commonly used.
More modern variants use HEMTs or GaN-on-SiC power semiconductor devices instead of magnetrons to generate the microwaves, which are substantially less complex and can be adjusted to maximize light output using a PID controller.

==History==
In 1910, Hans Gerdien (1877–1951) of the Siemens Corporation invented a magnetron. In 1912, Swiss physicist Heinrich Greinacher was looking for new ways to calculate the electron mass. He settled on a system consisting of a diode with a cylindrical anode surrounding a rod-shaped cathode, placed in the middle of a magnet. The attempt to measure the electron mass failed because he was unable to achieve a good vacuum in the tube. However, as part of this work, Greinacher developed mathematical models of the motion of the electrons in the crossed magnetic and electric fields.

In the US, Albert Hull put this work to use in an attempt to bypass Western Electric&#x27;s patents on the triode. Western Electric had gained control of this design by buying Lee De Forest&#x27;s patents on the control of current flow using electric fields via the &quot;grid&quot;. Hull intended to use a variable magnetic field, instead of an electrostatic one, to control the flow of the electrons from the cathode to the anode. Working at General Electric&#x27;s Research Laboratories in Schenectady, New York, Hull built tubes that provided switching through the control of the ratio of the magnetic and electric field strengths. He released several papers and patents on the concept in 1921.

Hull&#x27;s magnetron was not originally intended to generate VHF (very-high-frequency) electromagnetic waves. However, in 1924, Czech physicist August Žáček (1886–1961) and German physicist Erich Habann (1892–1968) independently discovered that the magnetron could generate waves of 100 megahertz to 1 gigahertz. Žáček, a professor at Prague&#x27;s Charles University, published first; however, he published in a journal with a small circulation and thus attracted little attention. Habann, a student at the University of Jena, investigated the magnetron for his doctoral dissertation of 1924. Throughout the 1920s, Hull and other researchers around the world worked to develop the magnetron. Most of these early magnetrons were glass vacuum tubes with multiple anodes. However, the two-pole magnetron, also known as a split-anode magnetron, had relatively low efficiency.

While radar was being developed during World War II, there arose an urgent need for a high-power microwave generator that worked at shorter wavelengths, around 10 cm (3 GHz), rather than the 50 to 150 cm (200 MHz) that was available from tube-based generators of the time. It was known that a multi-cavity resonant magnetron had been developed and patented in 1935 by Hans Hollmann in Berlin. However, the German military considered the frequency drift of Hollman&#x27;s device to be undesirable, and based their radar systems on the klystron instead. But klystrons could not at that time achieve the high power output that magnetrons eventually reached. This was one reason that German night fighter radars, which never strayed beyond the low-UHF band to start with for front-line aircraft, were not a match for their British counterparts. Likewise, in the UK, Albert Beaumont Wood proposed in 1937 a system with &quot;six or eight small holes&quot; drilled in a metal block, differing from the later production designs only in the aspects of vacuum sealing. However, his idea was rejected by the Navy, who said their valve department was far too busy to consider it.


In 1940, at the University of Birmingham in the UK, John Randall and Harry Boot produced a working prototype of a cavity magnetron that produced about 400 W. Within a week this had improved to 1 kW, and within the next few months, with the addition of water cooling and many detail changes, this had improved to 10 and then 25 kW. To deal with its drifting frequency, they sampled the output signal and synchronized their receiver to whatever frequency was actually being generated. In 1941, the problem of frequency instability was solved by James Sayers coupling (&quot;strapping&quot;) alternate cavities within the magnetron, which reduced the instability by a factor of 5–6. (For an overview of early magnetron designs, including that of Boot and Randall, see .) 

GEC at Wembley made 12 prototype cavity magnetrons in August 1940, and No 12 was sent to America with Bowen on the Tizard Mission, where it was shown on 19 September 1940 in Alfred Loomis’ apartment. The American NDRC Microwave Committee was stunned at the power level produced. However Bell Labs&#x27; director was upset when it was X-rayed and had eight holes rather than the six holes shown on the GEC plans. After contacting (via the transatlantic cable) Dr Eric Megaw, GEC’s vacuum tube expert Megaw recalled that when he had asked for 12 prototypes he said make 10 with 6 holes, one with 7 and one with 8; there was no time to amend the drawings. And No 12 with 8 holes was chosen for the Tizard Mission. So Bell Labs chose to copy the sample; and while early British magnetrons had six cavities the American ones had eight cavities. 

According to Andy Manning from the RAF Air Defence Radar Museum, Randall and Boot&#x27;s discovery was &quot;a massive, massive breakthrough&quot; and &quot;deemed by many, even now [2007], to be the most important invention that came out of the Second World War&quot;, while professor of military history at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, David Zimmerman, states:

Because France had just fallen to the Nazis and Britain had no money to develop the magnetron on a massive scale, Winston Churchill agreed that Sir Henry Tizard should offer the magnetron to the Americans in exchange for their financial and industrial help. An early 10 kW version, built in England by the General Electric Company Research Laboratories in Wembley, London, was taken on the Tizard Mission in September 1940. As the discussion turned to radar, the US Navy representatives began to detail the problems with their short-wavelength systems, complaining that their klystrons could only produce 10 W. With a flourish, &quot;Taffy&quot; Bowen pulled out a magnetron and explained it produced 1000 times that.

Bell Telephone Laboratories took the example and quickly began making copies, and before the end of 1940, the Radiation Laboratory had been set up on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop various types of radar using the magnetron. By early 1941, portable centimetric airborne radars were being tested in American and British aircraft. In late 1941, the Telecommunications Research Establishment in the United Kingdom used the magnetron to develop a revolutionary airborne, ground-mapping radar codenamed H2S. The H2S radar was in part developed by Alan Blumlein and Bernard Lovell.

The cavity magnetron was widely used during World War II in microwave radar equipment and is often credited with giving Allied radar a considerable performance advantage over German and Japanese radars, thus directly influencing the outcome of the war. It was later described by American historian James Phinney Baxter III as &quot;[t]he most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores&quot;.

Centimetric radar, made possible by the cavity magnetron, allowed for the detection of much smaller objects and the use of much smaller antennas. The combination of small-cavity magnetrons, small antennas, and high resolution allowed small, high quality radars to be installed in aircraft. They could be used by maritime patrol aircraft to detect objects as small as a submarine periscope, which allowed aircraft to attack and destroy submerged submarines which had previously been undetectable from the air. Centimetric contour mapping radars like H2S improved the accuracy of Allied bombers used in the strategic bombing campaign, despite the existence of the German FuG 350 &quot;Naxos&quot; device to specifically detect it. Centimetric gun-laying radars were likewise far more accurate than the older technology. They made the big-gunned Allied battleships more deadly and, along with the newly developed proximity fuze, made anti-aircraft guns much more dangerous to attacking aircraft. The two coupled together and used by anti-aircraft batteries, placed along the flight path of German V-1 flying bombs on their way to London, are credited with destroying many of the flying bombs before they reached their target.

Since then, many millions of cavity magnetrons have been manufactured; while some have been for radar the vast majority have been for microwave ovens. The use in radar itself has dwindled to some extent, as more accurate signals have generally been needed and developers have moved to klystron and traveling-wave tube systems for these needs.

==Health hazards==

At least one hazard in particular is well known and documented. As the lens of the eye has no cooling blood flow, it is particularly prone to overheating when exposed to microwave radiation. This heating can in turn lead to a higher incidence of cataracts in later life.

There is also a considerable electrical hazard around magnetrons, as they require a high voltage power supply.

Most magnetrons contain a small amount of beryllium oxide for the insulators, and thorium mixed with tungsten in their filament. Exceptions to this are higher power magnetrons that operate above approximately 10,000 volts where positive ion bombardment becomes damaging to thorium metal, hence pure tungsten (potassium doped) is used. While thorium is a radioactive metal, the risk of cancer is low as it never gets airborne in normal usage. Only if the filament is taken out of the magnetron, finely crushed, and inhaled can it pose a health hazard.

<doc id="20862" wikidata="Q1550557" url="?curid=20862" title="Manorialism">
<text>Manorialism, also known as seigneurialism, the manor system or manorial system, was the method of land ownership (or &quot;tenure&quot;) in parts of Europe, notably France and later England, during the Middle Ages. Its defining features included a large, sometimes fortified manor house in which the lord of the manor and his dependants lived and administered a rural estate, and a population of labourers or serfs who worked the surrounding land to support themselves and the lord. These labourers fulfilled their obligations with labour time or in-kind produce at first, and later by cash payment as commercial activity increased. Manorialism was part of the feudal system.

Manorialism originated in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire, and was widely practised in medieval western Europe and parts of central Europe. An essential element of feudal society, manorialism was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract.

Manorialism faded away slowly and piecemeal, along with its most vivid feature in the landscape, the open field system. It outlasted serfdom in the sense that it continued with freehold labourers. As an economic system, it outlasted feudalism, according to Andrew Jones, because &quot;it could maintain a warrior, but it could equally well maintain a capitalist landlord. It could be self-sufficient, yield produce for the market, or it could yield a money rent.&quot; The last feudal dues in France were abolished at the French Revolution. In parts of eastern Germany, the &quot;Rittergut&quot; manors of Junkers remained until World War II.

== Historical and geographical distribution ==
The term is most often used with reference to medieval Western Europe. Antecedents of the system can be traced to the rural economy of the later Roman Empire (Dominate). Labour was the key factor of production. Successive administrations tried to stabilise the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place: sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade, councillors were forbidden to resign, and &quot;coloni&quot;, the cultivators of land, were not to move from the land they were attached to. The workers of the land were on their way to becoming serfs.

Several factors conspired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such &quot;coloni&quot;: it was possible to be described as &quot;servus et colonus&quot;, &quot;both slave and &quot;colonus&quot;&quot;. The Laws of Constantine I around 325 both reinforced the semi-servile status of the &quot;coloni&quot; and limited their rights to sue in the courts; the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot; promulgated under Theodosius II extended these restrictions. The legal status of &quot;adscripti&quot;, &quot;bound to the soil&quot;, contrasted with barbarian &quot;foederati&quot;, who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries, remaining subject to their own traditional law.

As the Germanic kingdoms succeeded Roman authority in the west in the fifth century, Roman landlords were often simply replaced by Germanic ones, with little change to the underlying situation or displacement of populations.

The process of rural self-sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century, when normal trade in the Mediterranean Sea was disrupted.

== Description ==

The word derives from traditional inherited divisions of the countryside, reassigned as local jurisdictions known as manors or seigneuries; each manor being subject to a lord (French &quot;seigneur&quot;), usually holding his position in return for undertakings offered to a higher lord (see Feudalism). The lord held a manorial court, governed by public law and local custom. Not all territorial seigneurs were secular; bishops and abbots also held lands that entailed similar obligations.

By extension, the word &quot;manor&quot; is sometimes used in England as a slang term for any home area or territory in which authority is held, often in a police or criminal context.

In the generic plan of a medieval manor from &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Historical Atlas&quot;, the strips of individually worked land in the open field system are immediately apparent. In this plan, the manor house is set slightly apart from the village, but equally often the village grew up around the forecourt of the manor, formerly walled, while the manor lands stretched away outside, as still may be seen at Petworth House. As concerns for privacy increased in the 18th century, manor houses were often located a farther distance from the village. For example, when a grand new house was required by the new owner of Harlaxton Manor, Lincolnshire, in the 1830s, the site of the existing manor house at the edge of its village was abandoned for a new one, isolated in its park, with the village out of view.

In an agrarian society, the conditions of land tenure underlie all social or economic factors. There were two legal systems of pre-manorial landholding. One, the most common, was the system of holding land &quot;allodially&quot; in full outright ownership. The other was a use of &quot;precaria&quot; or benefices, in which land was held conditionally (the root of the English word &quot;precarious&quot;).

To these two systems, the Carolingian monarchs added a third, the &quot;aprisio&quot;, which linked manorialism with feudalism. The &quot;aprisio&quot; made its first appearance in Charlemagne&#x27;s province of Septimania in the south of France, when Charlemagne had to settle the Visigothic refugees who had fled with his retreating forces after the failure of his Zaragoza expedition of 778. He solved this problem by allotting &quot;desert&quot; tracts of uncultivated land belonging to the royal &quot;fisc&quot; under direct control of the emperor. These holdings &quot;aprisio&quot; entailed specific conditions. The earliest specific &quot;aprisio&quot; grant that has been identified was at Fontjoncouse, near Narbonne (see Lewis, links). In former Roman settlements, a system of villas, dating from Late Antiquity, was inherited by the medieval world.

=== The seigneur ===
The possessor of a seigneurie bears the title of &quot;Lord&quot;. He can be an individual, in the vast majority of cases a national of the nobility or of the Bourgeoisie, but also a judicial person most often an ecclesiastical institution such as an abbey, a cathedral or canonical chapter or a military order. The power of the lord was exercised through various intermediaries, the most important of which was the bailiff. The sovereign can also be a lord; the seigneuries he owns form the royal domain.

The title of lord is also granted, especially in modern times, to individuals holding noble fiefdoms which are not for all that seigneuries. These &quot;lords&quot; are sometimes called sieurs, equivalent terms in medieval times.

=== The land lordship ===
The lord is the direct or prominent owner of the land assets of his lordship. The notion of absolute ownership over a common good cannot be applied, because there are also others than the main user who have rights over these goods. We distinguish in the land lordship two sets the reserves which is the set of goods of which the lord reserves the direct exploitation and tenant-in-chief, property whose exploitation is entrusted to a tenant against payment of a royalty, most often called cens and services such as Corvée. The distribution between reserve and tenure varies depending on the period and region.

==Common features==

Manors each consisted of up to three classes of land:
#Demesne, the part directly controlled by the lord and used for the benefit of his household and dependents;
#Dependent (serf or villein) holdings carrying the obligation that the peasant household supply the lord with specified labour services or a part of its output (or cash in lieu thereof), subject to the custom attached to the holding; and
#Free peasant land, without such obligation but otherwise subject to manorial jurisdiction and custom, and owing money rent fixed at the time of the lease.

Additional sources of income for the lord included charges for use of his mill, bakery or wine-press, or for the right to hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland, as well as court revenues and single payments on each change of tenant. On the other side of the account, manorial administration involved significant expenses, perhaps a reason why smaller manors tended to rely less on villein tenure.

Dependent holdings were held nominally by arrangement of lord and tenant, but tenure became in practice almost universally hereditary, with a payment made to the lord on each succession of another member of the family. Villein land could not be abandoned, at least until demographic and economic circumstances made flight a viable proposition; nor could they be passed to a third party without the lord&#x27;s permission, and the customary payment.

Although not free, villeins were by no means in the same position as slaves: they enjoyed legal rights, subject to local custom, and had recourse to the law subject to court charges, which were an additional source of manorial income. Sub-letting of villein holdings was common, and labour on the demesne might be commuted into an additional money payment, as happened increasingly from the 13th century.

Land which was neither let to tenants nor formed part of demesne lands was known as &quot;manorial waste&quot;; typically, this included hedges, verges, etc. Common land where all members of the community had right of passage was known as &quot;lord&#x27;s waste&quot;. Part of the demesne land of the manor which being uncultivated was termed the Lord&#x27;s Waste and served for public roads and for common pasture to the lord and his tenants. In many settlements during the early modern period, illegal building was carried out on lord&#x27;s waste land by squatters who would then plead their case to remain with local support. An example of a lord&#x27;s waste settlement, where the main centres grew up in this way, is the village of Bredfield in Suffolk. Lord&#x27;s waste continues to be a source of rights and responsibilities issues in places such as Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire.

In examining the origins of the monastic cloister, Walter Horn found that &quot;as a manorial entity the Carolingian monastery ... differed little from the fabric of a feudal estate, save that the corporate community of men for whose sustenance this organisation was maintained consisted of monks who served God in chant and spent much of their time in reading and writing.&quot;

===Residents of a manor===
*Lord of the manor (who could be an absentee)
*Serfs
*Villeins
*Cottars
*Bordars
*Freeholders
*Copyholders

===Tenants===
Tenants owned land on the manor under one of several legal agreements: freehold, copyhold, customary freehold and leasehold.

==Variation among manors==
Like feudalism which, together with manorialism, formed the legal and organisational framework of feudal society, manorial structures were not uniform or coordinated. In the later Middle Ages, areas of incomplete or non-existent manorialisation persisted while the manorial economy underwent substantial development with changing economic conditions.

Not all manors contained all three classes of land. Typically, demesne accounted for roughly a third of the arable area, and villein holdings rather more; but some manors consisted solely of demesne, others solely of peasant holdings. The proportion of unfree and free tenures could likewise vary greatly, with more or less reliance on wage labour for agricultural work on the demesne.

The proportion of the cultivated area in demesne tended to be greater in smaller manors, while the share of villein land was greater in large manors, providing the lord of the latter with a larger supply of obligatory labour for demesne work. The proportion of free tenements was generally less variable, but tended to be somewhat greater on the smaller manors.

Manors varied similarly in their geographical arrangement: most did not coincide with a single village, but rather consisted of parts of two or more villages, most of the latter containing also parts of at least one other manor. This situation sometimes led to replacement by cash payments or their equivalents in kind of the demesne labour obligations of those peasants living furthest from the lord&#x27;s estate.

As with peasant plots, the demesne was not a single territorial unit, but consisted rather of a central house with neighbouring land and estate buildings, plus strips dispersed through the manor alongside free and villein ones: in addition, the lord might lease free tenements belonging to neighbouring manors, as well as holding other manors some distance away to provide a greater range of produce.

Nor were manors held necessarily by lay lords rendering military service (or again, cash in lieu) to their superior: a substantial share (estimated by value at 17% in England in 1086) belonged directly to the king, and a greater proportion (rather more than a quarter) were held by bishoprics and monasteries. Ecclesiastical manors tended to be larger, with a significantly greater villein area than neighbouring lay manors.

The effect of circumstances on manorial economy is complex and at times contradictory: upland conditions tended to preserve peasant freedoms (livestock husbandry in particular being less labour-intensive and therefore less demanding of villein services); on the other hand, some upland areas of Europe showed some of the most oppressive manorial conditions, while lowland eastern England is credited with an exceptionally large free peasantry, in part a legacy of Scandinavian settlement.

Similarly, the spread of money economy stimulated the replacement of labour services by money payments, but the growth of the money supply and resulting inflation after 1170 initially led nobles to take back leased estates and to re-impose labour dues as the value of fixed cash payments declined in real terms.

== Abolition ==
The last feudal dues in France were abolished at the French Revolution. The last patroonship was abolished in New York in the 1840s as a result of the Anti-Rent War. In parts of eastern Germany, the &quot;Rittergut&quot; manors of Junkers remained until World War II. In Quebec, the last feudal rents were paid in 1970 under the modified provisions of the &quot;Seigniorial Dues Abolition Act&quot; of 1935.

<text>Margaret Munnerlyn Mitchell (November 8, 1900 – August 16, 1949) was an American novelist and journalist. Mitchell wrote only one novel that was published during her lifetime, the American Civil War-era novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, for which she won the National Book Award for Fiction for Most Distinguished Novel of 1936 and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937. Long after her death, a collection of Mitchell&#x27;s girlhood writings and a novella she wrote as a teenager, titled &quot;Lost Laysen&quot;, were published. A collection of newspaper articles written by Mitchell for &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot; was republished in book form.

==Family history==
Margaret Mitchell was a lifelong resident of Georgia. She was born in 1900 into a wealthy and politically prominent family. Her father, Eugene Muse Mitchell, was an attorney, and her mother, Mary Isabel &quot;Maybelle&quot; Stephens, was a suffragist and Catholic activist. She had two brothers, Russell Stephens Mitchell, who died in infancy in 1894, and Alexander Stephens Mitchell, born in 1896.

Mitchell&#x27;s family on her father&#x27;s side were descendants of Thomas Mitchell, originally of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, who settled in Wilkes County, Georgia in 1777, and served in the American Revolutionary War. Thomas Mitchell was a surveyor by profession. He was on a surveying trip in Henry County, Georgia, at the home of John Lowe, about 6 miles from McDonough, Georgia, when he died in 1835 and is buried in that location. Thomas Mitchell&#x27;s son, William Mitchell, born December 8, 1777, in Edgefield County, South Carolina, moved in 1834-1835 to a farm along the South River in the Flat Rock community in Georgia. William Mitchell died February 24, 1859, at the age of 81 and is buried in the family graveyard near Panola Mountain State Park. Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s great-grandfather Issac Green Mitchell moved to a farm along the Flat Shoals Road located in the Flat Rock community in 1839. Four years later he sold this farm to Ira O. McDaniel and purchased a farm 3 miles farther down the road on the north side of the South River in DeKalb County, Georgia.

Her grandfather, Russell Crawford Mitchell, of Atlanta, enlisted in the Confederate States Army on June 24, 1861, and served in Hood&#x27;s Texas Brigade. He was severely wounded at the Battle of Sharpsburg, demoted for &quot;inefficiency&quot;, and detailed as a nurse in Atlanta. After the Civil War, he made a large fortune supplying lumber for the rapid rebuilding of Atlanta. Russell Mitchell had thirteen children from two wives; the eldest was Eugene, who graduated from the University of Georgia Law School.

Mitchell&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Philip Fitzgerald, emigrated from Ireland and eventually settled on a slaveholding plantation, Rural Home, near Jonesboro, Georgia, where he had one son and seven daughters with his wife, Elenor McGahan, who was from an Irish Catholic family with ties to Colonial Maryland. Mitchell&#x27;s grandparents, married in 1863, were Annie Fitzgerald and John Stephens; he had also emigrated from Ireland and became a captain in the Confederate States Army. John Stephens was a prosperous real estate developer after the Civil War and one of the founders of the Gate City Street Railroad (1881), a mule-drawn Atlanta trolley system. John and Annie Stephens had twelve children together; the seventh child was May Belle Stephens, who married Eugene Mitchell. May Belle Stephens had studied at the Bellevue Convent in Quebec and completed her education at the Atlanta Female Institute.

The &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; reported that May Belle Stephens and Eugene Mitchell were married at the Jackson Street mansion of the bride&#x27;s parents on November 8, 1892:

the maid of honor, Miss Annie Stephens, was as pretty as a French pastel, in a directoire costume of yellow satin with a long coat of green velvet sleeves, and a vest of gold brocade...The bride was a fair vision of youthful loveliness in her robe of exquisite ivory white and satin...her slippers were white satin wrought with pearls...an elegant supper was served. The dining room was decked in white and green, illuminated with numberless candles in silver candlelabras...The bride&#x27;s gift from her father was an elegant house and lot...At 11 o&#x27;clock Mrs. Mitchell donned a pretty going-away gown of green English cloth with its jaunty velvet hat to match and bid goodbye to her friends.

==Early influences==
Mitchell spent her early childhood on Jackson Hill, east of downtown Atlanta. Her family lived near her maternal grandmother, Annie Stephens, in a Victorian house painted bright red with yellow trim. Mrs. Stephens had been a widow for several years prior to Margaret&#x27;s birth; Captain John Stephens died in 1896. After his death, she inherited property on Jackson Street where Margaret&#x27;s family lived.

Grandmother Annie Stephens was quite a character, both vulgar and a tyrant. After gaining control of her father Philip Fitzgerald&#x27;s money after he died, she splurged on her younger daughters, including Margaret&#x27;s mother, and sent them to finishing school in the north. There they learned that Irish Americans were not treated as equal to other immigrants. Margaret&#x27;s relationship with her grandmother would become quarrelsome in later years as she entered adulthood. However, for Margaret, her grandmother was a great source of &quot;eye-witness information&quot; about the Civil War and Reconstruction in Atlanta prior to her death in 1934.

===Girlhood on Jackson Hill===

In an accident that was traumatic for her mother although she was unharmed, when Mitchell was about three years old, her dress caught fire on an iron grate. Fearing it would happen again, her mother began dressing her in boys&#x27; pants, and she was nicknamed &quot;Jimmy&quot;, the name of a character in the comic strip &quot;Little Jimmy&quot;. Her brother insisted she would have to be a boy named Jimmy to play with him. Having no sisters to play with, Mitchell said she was a boy named Jimmy until she was fourteen.

Stephens Mitchell said his sister was a tomboy who would happily play with dolls occasionally, and she liked to ride her Texas plains pony. As a little girl, Mitchell went riding every afternoon with a Confederate veteran and a young lady of &quot;beau-age&quot;. She was raised in an era when children were &quot;seen and not heard&quot; and was not allowed to express her personality by running and screaming on Sunday afternoons while her family was visiting relatives. 
Mitchell learned the gritty details of specific battles from these visits with aging Confederate soldiers. But she didn&#x27;t learn that the South had actually lost the war until she was 10 years of age: &quot;I heard everything in the world except that the Confederates lost the war. When I was ten years old, it was a violent shock to learn that General Lee had been defeated. I didn&#x27;t believe it when I first heard it and I was indignant. I still find it hard to believe, so strong are childhood impressions.&quot; Her mother would swat her with a hairbrush or a slipper as a form of discipline.

May Belle Mitchell was &quot;hissing blood-curdling threats&quot; to her daughter to make her behave the evening she took her to a women&#x27;s suffrage rally led by Carrie Chapman Catt. Her daughter sat on a platform wearing a Votes-for-Women banner, blowing kisses to the gentlemen, while her mother gave an impassioned speech. She was nineteen years old when the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, which gave women the right to vote.

May Belle Mitchell was president of the Atlanta Woman&#x27;s Suffrage League (1915), co-founder of Georgia&#x27;s division of the League of Women Voters, chairwoman of press publicity for the Georgia Mothers&#x27; Congress and Parent Teacher Association, a member of the Pioneer Society, the Atlanta Woman&#x27;s Club, and several Catholic and literary societies.

Mitchell&#x27;s father was not in favor of corporal punishment in school. During his tenure as president of the educational board (1911–1912), corporal punishment in the public schools was abolished. Reportedly, Eugene Mitchell received a whipping on the first day he attended school and the mental impression of the thrashing lasted far longer than the physical marks.

Jackson Hill was an old, affluent part of the city. At the bottom of Jackson Hill was an area of African-American homes and businesses called &quot;Darktown&quot;. The mayhem of the Atlanta Race Riot occurred over four days in September 1906 when Mitchell was five years old. Local white newspapers printed unfounded rumors that several white women had been assaulted by black men, prompting an angry mob of 10,000 to assemble in the streets, pulling black people from street cars, beating, killing dozens over the next three days.

Eugene Mitchell went to bed early the night the rioting began, but was awakened by the sounds of gunshots. The following morning, as he later wrote, to his wife, he learned &quot;16 negroes had been killed and a multitude had been injured&quot; and that rioters &quot;killed or tried to kill every Negro they saw&quot;. As the rioting continued, rumors ran wild that black people would burn Jackson Hill. At his daughter&#x27;s suggestion, Eugene Mitchell, who did not own a gun, stood guard with a sword.
Though the rumors proved untrue and no attack arrived, Mitchell recalled twenty years later the terror she felt during the riot. Mitchell grew up in a Southern culture where the fear of black-on-white rape incited mob violence, and in this world, white Georgians lived in fear of the &quot;black beast rapist&quot;.

A few years after the riot, the Mitchell family decided to move away from Jackson Hill. In 1912, they moved to the east side of Peachtree Street just north of Seventeenth Street in Atlanta. Past the nearest neighbor&#x27;s house was forest and beyond it the Chattahoochee River. Mitchell&#x27;s former Jackson Hill home was destroyed in the Great Atlanta Fire of 1917.

Mitchell&#x27;s father was of a Protestant background, while her mother was a devout Catholic; Mitchell was raised in a Catholic household. As a young woman, she spent time visiting the Sisters of Mercy convent affiliated with St. Joseph&#x27;s Infirmary in downtown Atlanta. Her religious upbringing influenced her decision to make the O&#x27;Hara family in her novel Catholics in a Protestant-majority state. One of Mitchell&#x27;s mother&#x27;s cousins entered the Sisters of Mercy at St. Vincent&#x27;s Convent in Savannah in 1883, becoming Sister Mary Melanie. The characters Melanie Hamilton and Careen O&#x27;Hara were probably based on this relation.

===The South of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;===
While &quot;the South&quot; exists as a geographical region of the United States, it is also said to exist as &quot;a place of the imagination&quot; of writers. An image of &quot;the South&quot; was fixed in Mitchell&#x27;s imagination when at six years old her mother took her on a buggy tour through ruined plantations and &quot;Sherman&#x27;s sentinels&quot;, the brick and stone chimneys that remained after William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s &quot;March and torch&quot; through Georgia. Mitchell would later recall what her mother had said to her:

She talked about the world those people had lived in, such a secure world, and how it had exploded beneath them. And she told me that my world was going to explode under me, someday, and God help me if I didn&#x27;t have some weapon to meet the new world.

From an imagination cultivated in her youth, Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s defensive weapon would become her writing.

Mitchell said she heard Civil War stories from her relatives when she was growing up:

On Sunday afternoons when we went calling on the older generation of relatives, those who had been active in the Sixties, I sat on the bony knees of veterans and the fat slippery laps of great aunts and heard them talk.

On summer vacations, she visited her maternal great-aunts, Mary Ellen (&quot;Mamie&quot;) Fitzgerald and Sarah (&quot;Sis&quot;) Fitzgerald, who still lived at her great-grandparents&#x27; plantation home in Jonesboro. Mamie had been twenty-one years old and Sis was thirteen when the Civil War began.

===An avid reader===
An avid reader, young Margaret read &quot;boys&#x27; stories&quot; by G.A. Henty, the Tom Swift series, and the Rover Boys series by Edward Stratemeyer. Her mother read Mary Johnston&#x27;s novels to her before she could read. They both wept reading Johnston&#x27;s &quot;The Long Roll&quot; (1911) and &quot;Cease Firing&quot; (1912). Between the &quot;scream of shells, the mighty onrush of charges, the grim and grisly aftermath of war&quot;, &quot;Cease Firing&quot; is a romance novel involving the courtship of a Confederate soldier and a Louisiana plantation belle with Civil War illustrations by N. C. Wyeth. She also read the plays of William Shakespeare, and novels by Charles Dickens and Sir Walter Scott. Mitchell&#x27;s two favorite children&#x27;s books were by author Edith Nesbit: &quot;Five Children and It&quot; (1902) and &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; (1904). She kept both on her bookshelf even as an adult and gave them as gifts. Another author whom Mitchell read as a teenager and who had a major impact in her understanding of the Civil War and Reconstruction was Thomas Dixon. Dixon&#x27;s popular trilogy of novels &quot;The Leopard&#x27;s Spots: A Romance of the White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot; (1902), &quot;The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan&quot; (1905) and &quot;The Traitor: A Story of the Rise and Fall of the Invisible Empire&quot; (1907) all depicted in vivid terms a white South victimized during the Reconstruction by Northern carpetbaggers and freed slaves, with an especial emphasis upon Reconstruction as a nightmarish time when black men ran amok, raping white women with impunity. As a teenager, Mitchell liked Dixon&#x27;s books so much that she organized the local children to put on dramatizations of his books. The picture that white supremacist Dixon drew of Reconstruction is now rejected as inaccurate, but at the time, the memory of the past was such that it was widely believed by white Americans. In a letter to Dixon dated August 10, 1936, Mitchell wrote: &quot;I was practically raised on your books, and love them very much.&quot;

==Young storyteller==
An imaginative and precocious writer, Margaret Mitchell began with stories about animals, then progressed to fairy tales and adventure stories. She fashioned book covers for her stories, bound the tablet paper pages together and added her own artwork. At age eleven she gave a name to her publishing enterprise: &quot;Urchin Publishing Co.&quot; Later her stories were written in notebooks. May Belle Mitchell kept her daughter&#x27;s stories in white enamel bread boxes and several boxes of her stories were stored in the house by the time Margaret went off to college.

&quot;Margaret&quot; is a character riding a galloping pony in &quot;The Little Pioneers&quot;, and plays &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot; in &quot;When We Were Shipwrecked&quot;.

Romantic love and honor emerged as themes of abiding interest for Mitchell in &quot;The Knight and the Lady&quot; (ca. 1909), in which a &quot;good knight&quot; and a &quot;bad knight&quot; duel for the hand of the lady. In &quot;The Arrow Brave and the Deer Maiden&quot; (ca. 1913), a half-white Indian brave, Jack, must withstand the pain inflicted upon him to uphold his honor and win the girl. The same themes were treated with increasing artistry in &quot;Lost Laysen&quot;, the novella Mitchell wrote as a teenager in 1916, and, with much greater sophistication, in Mitchell&#x27;s last known novel, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, which she began in 1926.

In her pre-teens, Mitchell also wrote stories set in foreign locations, such as &quot;The Greaser&quot; (1913), a cowboy story set in Mexico. In 1913 she wrote two stories with Civil War settings; one includes her notation that &quot;237 pages are in this book&quot;.

==School life==

While the Great War carried on in Europe (1914–1918), Margaret Mitchell attended Atlanta&#x27;s Washington Seminary (now The Westminster Schools), a &quot;fashionable&quot; private girls&#x27; school with an enrollment of over 300 students. She was very active in the Drama Club. Mitchell played the male characters: Nick Bottom in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and Launcelot Gobbo in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, among others. She wrote a play about snobbish college girls that she acted in as well. She also joined the Literary Club and had two stories published in the yearbook: &quot;Little Sister&quot; and &quot;Sergeant Terry&quot;. Ten-year-old &quot;Peggy&quot; is the heroine in &quot;Little Sister&quot;. She hears her older sister being raped and shoots the rapist:

Coldly, dispassionately she viewed him, the chill steel of the gun giving her confidence. She must not miss now—she would not miss—and she did not.

Mitchell received encouragement from her English teacher, Mrs. Paisley, who recognized her writing talent. A demanding teacher, Paisley told her she had ability if she worked hard and would not be careless in constructing sentences. A sentence, she said, must be &quot;complete, concise and coherent&quot;.

Mitchell read the books of Thomas Dixon, Jr., and in 1916, when the silent film, &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, was showing in Atlanta, she dramatized Dixon&#x27;s &quot;The Traitor: A Story of the Fall of the Invisible Empire&quot; (1907). As both playwright and actress, she took the role of Steve Hoyle. For the production, she made a Ku Klux Klan costume from a white crepe dress and wore a boy&#x27;s wig. (Note: Dixon rewrote &quot;The Traitor&quot; as &quot;The Black Hood&quot; (1924) and Steve Hoyle was renamed George Wilkes.)

During her years at Washington Seminary, Mitchell&#x27;s brother, Stephens, was away studying at Harvard College (1915–1917), and he left in May 1917 to enlist in the army, about a month after the U.S. declared war on Germany. He set sail for France in April 1918, participated in engagements in the Lagny and Marbache sectors, then returned to Georgia in October as a training instructor. While Margaret and her mother were in New York in September 1918 preparing for Margaret to attend college, Stephens wired his father that he was safe after his ship had been torpedoed en route to New York from France.

Stephens Mitchell thought college was the &quot;ruination of girls&quot;. However, May Belle Mitchell placed a high value on education for women and she wanted her daughter&#x27;s future accomplishments to come from using her mind. She saw education as Margaret&#x27;s weapon and &quot;the key to survival&quot;. The classical college education she desired for her daughter was one that was on par with men&#x27;s colleges, and this type of education was available only at northern schools. Her mother chose Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts for Margaret because she considered it to be the best women&#x27;s college in the United States.

Upon graduating from Washington Seminary in June 1918, Mitchell fell in love with a Harvard graduate, a young army lieutenant, Clifford West Henry, who was chief bayonet instructor at Camp Gordon from May 10 until the time he set sail for France on July 17. Henry was &quot;slightly effeminate&quot;, &quot;ineffectual&quot;, and &quot;rather effete-looking&quot; with &quot;homosexual tendencies&quot;, according to biographer Anne Edwards. Before departing for France, he gave Mitchell an engagement ring.

On September 14, while she was enrolled at Smith College, Henry was mortally wounded in action in France and died on October 17. As Henry waited in the Verdun trenches, shortly before being wounded, he composed a poem on a leaf torn from his field notebook, found later among his effects. The last stanza of Lieutenant Clifford W. Henry&#x27;s poem follows:
&lt;poem&gt;
If &quot;out of luck&quot; at duty&#x27;s call
In glorious action I should fall
 At God&#x27;s behest,

May those I hold most dear and best
Know I have stood the acid test
 Should I &quot;go West.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Henry repeatedly advanced in front of the platoon he commanded, drawing machine-gun fire so that the German nests could be located and wiped out by his men. Although wounded in the leg in this effort, his death was the result of shrapnel wounds from an air bomb dropped by a German plane. He was awarded the French &quot;Croix de guerre avec palme&quot; for his acts of heroism. From the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces, he was presented with the Distinguished Service Cross and an Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a second Distinguished Service Cross.

Clifford Henry was the great love of Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s life, according to her brother. In a letter to a friend (A. Edee, March 26, 1920), Mitchell wrote of Clifford that she had a &quot;memory of a love that had in it no trace of physical passion&quot;.

Mitchell had vague aspirations of a career in psychiatry, but her future was derailed by an event that killed over fifty million people worldwide, the 1918 flu pandemic. On January 25, 1919, her mother, May Belle Mitchell, succumbed to pneumonia from the &quot;Spanish flu&quot;. Mitchell arrived home from college a day after her mother had died. Knowing her death was imminent, May Belle Mitchell wrote her daughter a brief letter and advised her:

Give of yourself with both hands and overflowing heart, but give only the excess after you have lived your own life.

An average student at Smith College, Mitchell did not excel in any area of academics. She held a low estimation of her writing abilities. Even though her English professor had praised her work, she felt the praise was undue. After finishing her freshman year at Smith, Mitchell returned to Atlanta to take over the household for her father and never returned to college. In October 1919, while regaining her strength after an appendectomy, she confided to a friend that giving up college and her dreams of a &quot;journalistic career&quot; to keep house and take her mother&#x27;s place in society meant &quot;giving up all the worthwhile things that counted for—nothing!&quot;

==Marriage==

Margaret began using the name &quot;Peggy&quot; at Washington Seminary, and the abbreviated form &quot;Peg&quot; at Smith College, when she found an icon for herself in the mythological winged horse, &quot;Pegasus&quot;, that inspires poets. Peggy made her Atlanta society debut in the 1920 winter season. In the &quot;gin and jazz style&quot; of the times, she did her &quot;flapping&quot; in the 1920s. At a 1921 Atlanta debutante charity ball, she performed an Apache dance. The dance included a kiss with her male partner that shocked Atlanta high society and led to her being blacklisted from the Junior League. The Apache and the Tango were scandalous dances for their elements of eroticism, the latter popularized in a 1921 silent film, &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;, that made its lead actor, Rudolph Valentino, a sex symbol for his ability to Tango.

Mitchell was, in her own words, an &quot;unscrupulous flirt&quot;. She found herself engaged to five men, but maintained that she neither lied to nor misled any of them. A local gossip columnist, who wrote under the name Polly Peachtree, described Mitchell&#x27;s love life in a 1922 column:

...she has in her brief life, perhaps, had more men really, truly &#x27;dead in love&#x27; with her, more honest-to-goodness suitors than almost any other girl in Atlanta.

In April 1922, Mitchell was seeing two men almost daily: one was Berrien (&quot;Red&quot;) Kinnard Upshaw (March 10, 1901 – January 13, 1949), whom she is thought to have met in 1917 at a dance hosted by the parents of one of her friends, and the other, Upshaw&#x27;s roommate and friend, John Robert Marsh (October 6, 1895 – March 5, 1952), a copy editor from Kentucky who worked for the Associated Press. Upshaw was an Atlanta boy, a few months younger than Mitchell, whose family moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in 1916. In 1919 he was appointed to the United States Naval Academy, but resigned for academic deficiencies on January 5, 1920. He was readmitted in May, then 19 years old, and spent two months at sea before resigning a second time on September 1, 1920. Unsuccessful in his educational pursuits and with no job, in 1922 Upshaw earned money bootlegging alcohol out of the Georgia mountains.

Although her family disapproved, Peggy and Red married on September 2, 1922; the best man at their wedding was John Marsh, who would become her second husband. The couple resided at the Mitchell home with her father. By December the marriage to Upshaw had dissolved and he left. Mitchell suffered physical and emotional abuse, the result of Upshaw&#x27;s alcoholism and violent temper. Upshaw agreed to an uncontested divorce after John Marsh gave him a loan and Mitchell agreed not to press assault charges against him. Upshaw and Mitchell were divorced on October 16, 1924.

During this time, Mitchell left the Catholic Church and became an Episcopalian.

On July 4, 1925, 24-year-old Margaret Mitchell and 29-year-old John Marsh were married in the Unitarian-Universalist Church. The Marshes made their home at the Crescent Apartments in Atlanta, taking occupancy of Apt. 1, which they affectionately named &quot;The Dump&quot; (now the Margaret Mitchell House and Museum).
==Reporter for &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot;==

While still legally married to Upshaw and needing income for herself, Mitchell got a job writing feature articles for &quot;The Atlanta Journal Sunday Magazine&quot;. She received almost no encouragement from her family or &quot;society&quot; to pursue a career in journalism, and had no prior newspaper experience. Medora Field Perkerson, who hired Mitchell said:

There had been some skepticism on the Atlanta Journal Magazine staff when Peggy came to work as a reporter. Debutantes slept late in those days and didn&#x27;t go in for jobs.

Her first story, &quot;Atlanta Girl Sees Italian Revolution&quot;, by Margaret Mitchell Upshaw, appeared on December 31, 1922. She wrote on a wide range of topics, from fashions to Confederate generals and King Tut. In an article that appeared on July 1, 1923, &quot;Valentino Declares He Isn&#x27;t a Sheik&quot;, she interviewed celebrity actor Rudolph Valentino, referring to him as &quot;Sheik&quot; from his film role. Less thrilled by his looks than his &quot;chief charm&quot;, his &quot;low, husky voice with a soft, sibilant accent&quot;, she described his face as &quot;swarthy&quot;:

His face was swarthy, so brown that his white teeth flashed in startling contrast to his skin; his eyes—tired, bored, but courteous.

Mitchell was quite thrilled when Valentino took her in his arms and carried her inside from the rooftop of the Georgian Terrace Hotel.

Many of her stories were vividly descriptive. In an article titled, &quot;Bridesmaid of Eighty-Seven Recalls Mittie Roosevelt&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, she wrote of a white-columned mansion in which lived the last surviving bridesmaid at Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s mother&#x27;s wedding:

The tall white columns glimpsed through the dark green of cedar foliage, the wide veranda encircling the house, the stately silence engendered by the century-old oaks evoke memories of Thomas Nelson Page&#x27;s &quot;On Virginia&quot;. The atmosphere of dignity, ease, and courtesy that was the soul of the Old South breathes from this old mansion...

In another article, &quot;Georgia&#x27;s Empress and Women Soldiers&quot;, she wrote short sketches of four notable Georgia women. One was the first woman to serve in the United States Senate, Rebecca Latimer Felton, a suffragist who held white supremacist views. The other women were: Nancy Hart, Lucy Mathilda Kenny (also known as Private Bill Thompson of the Confederate States Army) and Mary Musgrove. The article generated mail and controversy from her readers. Mitchell received criticism for depicting &quot;strong women who did not fit the accepted standards of femininity&quot;.

Mitchell&#x27;s journalism career, which began in 1922, came to an end less than four years later; her last article appeared on May 9, 1926. Several months after marrying John Marsh, Mitchell quit due to an ankle injury that would not heal properly and chose to become a full-time wife. During the time Mitchell worked for the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot;, she wrote 129 feature articles, 85 news stories, and several book reviews.

==Interest in erotica==
Mitchell began collecting erotica from book shops in New York City while in her twenties. The newlywed Marshes and their social group were interested in &quot;all forms of sexual expression&quot;. Mitchell discussed her interest in dirty book shops and sexually explicit prose in letters to a friend, Harvey Smith. Smith noted her favorite reads were &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;, &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

Mitchell developed an appreciation for the works of Southern writer James Branch Cabell, and his 1919 classic, &quot;Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice&quot;. She read books about sexology and took particular interest in the case studies of Havelock Ellis, a British physician who studied human sexuality. During this period in which Mitchell was reading pornography and sexology, she was also writing &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

==Novelist==

===Early works===

====&quot;Lost Laysen&quot;====
Mitchell wrote a romance novella, &quot;Lost Laysen&quot;, when she was fifteen years old (1916). She gave &quot;Lost Laysen&quot;, which she had written in two notebooks, to a boyfriend, Henry Love Angel. He died in 1945 and the novella remained undiscovered among some letters she had written to him until 1994. The novella was published in 1996, eighty years after it was written, and became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller.

In &quot;Lost Laysen&quot;, Mitchell explores the dynamics of three male characters and their relationship to the only female character, Courtenay Ross, a strong-willed American missionary to the South Pacific island of Laysen. The narrator of the tale is Billy Duncan, &quot;a rough, hardened soldier of fortune&quot;, who is frequently involved in fights that leave him near death. Courtenay quickly observes Duncan&#x27;s hard-muscled body as he works shirtless aboard a ship called &quot;Caliban&quot;. Courtenay&#x27;s suitor is Douglas Steele, an athletic man who apparently believes Courtenay is helpless without him. He follows Courtenay to Laysen to protect her from perceived foreign savages. The third male character is the rich, powerful yet villainous Juan Mardo. He leers at Courtenay and makes rude comments of a sexual nature, in Japanese no less. Mardo provokes Duncan and Steele, and each feels he must defend Courtenay&#x27;s honor. Ultimately Courtenay defends her own honor rather than submit to shame.

Mitchell&#x27;s half-breed
antagonist, Juan Mardo, lurks in the shadows of the story and has no dialogue. The reader learns of Mardo&#x27;s evil intentions through Duncan:

They were saying that Juan Mardo had his eye on you—and intended to have you—any way he could get you!

Mardo&#x27;s desires are similar to those of Rhett Butler in his ardent pursuit of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in Mitchell&#x27;s epic novel, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Rhett tells Scarlett:

I always intended having you, one way or another.

The &quot;other way&quot; is rape. In &quot;Lost Laysen&quot; the male seducer is replaced with the male rapist.

====&quot;The Big Four&quot;====
In Mitchell&#x27;s teenage years, she is known to have written a 400-page novel about girls in a boarding school, &quot;The Big Four&quot;. The novel is thought to be lost; Mitchell destroyed some of her manuscripts herself and others were destroyed after her death.

====&quot;Ropa Carmagin&quot;====
In the 1920s Mitchell completed a novelette, &quot;Ropa Carmagin&quot;, about a Southern white girl who loves a biracial man. Mitchell submitted the manuscript to Macmillan Publishers in 1935 along with her manuscript for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. The novelette was rejected; Macmillan thought the story was too short for book form.

===Writing &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;===

In May 1926, after Mitchell had left her job at the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; and was recovering at home from her ankle injury, she wrote a society column for the &quot;Sunday Magazine&quot;, &quot;Elizabeth Bennet&#x27;s Gossip&quot;, which she continued to write until August. Meanwhile, her husband was growing weary of lugging armloads of books home from the library to keep his wife&#x27;s mind occupied while she hobbled around the house; he emphatically suggested that she write her own book instead:
For God&#x27;s sake, Peggy, can&#x27;t you write a book instead of reading thousands of them?

To aid her in her literary endeavors, John Marsh brought home a Remington Portable No. 3 typewriter (c. 1928). For the next three years Mitchell worked exclusively on writing a Civil War-era novel whose heroine was named Pansy O&#x27;Hara (prior to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;″s publication Pansy was changed to Scarlett). She used parts of the manuscript to prop up a wobbly couch.

In April 1935, Harold Latham of Macmillan, an editor looking for new fiction, read her manuscript and saw that it could be a best-seller. After Latham agreed to publish the book, Mitchell worked for another six months checking the historical references and rewriting the opening chapter several times. Mitchell and John Marsh edited the final version of the novel. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was published in June 1936.

==World War II==

During World War II, Margaret Mitchell was a volunteer for the American Red Cross and she raised money for the war effort by selling war bonds. She was active in Home Defense, sewed hospital gowns and put patches on trousers. Her personal attention, however, was devoted to writing letters to men in uniform—soldiers, sailors, and marines, sending them humor, encouragement, and her sympathy.
The USS &quot;Atlanta&quot; (CL-51) was a light cruiser used as an anti-aircraft ship of the United States Navy sponsored by Margaret Mitchell and used in the naval Battle of Midway and the Eastern Solomons. The ship was heavily damaged during night surface action on November 13, 1942, during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and subsequently scuttled on orders of her captain having earned five battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation as a &quot;heroic example of invincible fighting spirit&quot;.

Mitchell sponsored a second light cruiser named after the city of Atlanta, the USS &quot;Atlanta&quot; (CL-104). On February 6, 1944, she christened &quot;Atlanta&quot; in Camden, New Jersey, and the cruiser began fighting operations in May 1945. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was a member of task forces protecting fast carriers, was operating off the coast of Honshū when the Japanese surrendered on August 15, 1945, and earned two battle stars. She was finally sunk during explosive testing off San Clemente Island on October 1, 1970.

==Death and legacy==

Margaret Mitchell was struck by a speeding motorist as she crossed Peachtree Street at 13th Street in Atlanta with her husband, John Marsh, while on her way to see the movie &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; on the evening of August 11, 1949. She died at age 48 at Grady Hospital five days later on August 16 without fully regaining consciousness.

Mitchell was struck by Hugh Gravitt, an off-duty taxi driver who was driving his personal vehicle. After the collision, Gravitt was arrested for drunken driving and released on a $5,450 bond until Mitchell&#x27;s death.

Gravitt was originally charged with drunken driving, speeding, and driving on the wrong side of the road. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in November 1949 and sentenced to 18 months in jail. He served almost 11 months. Gravitt died in 1994 at the age of 74.

Margaret Mitchell was buried at Oakland Cemetery, Georgia. When her husband John died in 1952, he was buried next to his wife.

In 1978, Mitchell was inducted into the Georgia Newspaper Hall of Fame, followed by the Georgia Women of Achievement in 1994, and the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame in 2000.

In 1994, Shannen Doherty starred in the television film &quot;A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story&quot;, a fictionalized account of Mitchell&#x27;s life directed by Larry Peerce.
When Mitchell&#x27;s nephew, Joseph Mitchell, died in 2011, he left fifty percent of trademark and literary rights of the Margaret Mitchell Estate, as well as some personal belongings of Mitchell&#x27;s, to the Archdiocese of Atlanta.

<text>Metamorphosis is a biological process by which an animal physically develops including birth transformation or hatching, involving a conspicuous and relatively abrupt change in the animal&#x27;s body structure through cell growth and differentiation. Some insects, jellyfish, fish, amphibians, mollusks, crustaceans, cnidarians, echinoderms, and tunicates undergo metamorphosis, which is often accompanied by a change of nutrition source or behavior. Animals can be divided into species that undergo complete metamorphosis (&quot;holometaboly&quot;), incomplete metamorphosis (&quot;hemimetaboly&quot;), or no metamorphosis (&quot;ametaboly&quot;).

Generally organisms with a larval stage undergo metamorphosis, and during metamorphosis the organism loses larval characteristics.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;metamorphosis&quot; derives from Ancient Greek , &quot;transformation, transforming&quot;, from (&#x27;), &quot;after&quot; and (&#x27;), &quot;form&quot;.

== Hormonal control ==
In insects, growth and metamorphosis are controlled by hormones synthesized by endocrine glands near the front of the body (anterior). Neurosecretory cells in an insect&#x27;s brain secrete a hormone, the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) that activates prothoracic glands, which secrete a second hormone, usually ecdysone (an ecdysteroid), that induces ecdysis (shedding of the exoskeleton).
PTTH also stimulates the corpora allata, a retrocerebral organ, to produce juvenile hormone, which prevents the development of adult characteristics during ecdysis. In holometabolous insects, molts between larval instars have a high level of juvenile hormone, the moult to the pupal stage has a low level of juvenile hormone, and the final, or imaginal, molt has no juvenile hormone present at all. Experiments on firebugs have shown how juvenile hormone can affect the number of nymph instar stages in hemimetabolous insects.

In chordates, metamorphosis is iodothyronine-induced and an ancestral feature of all chordates.

== Insects ==
All three categories of metamorphosis can be found in the diversity of insects, including no metamorphosis (&quot;ametaboly&quot;), incomplete or partial metamorphosis (&quot;hemimetaboly&quot;), and complete metamorphosis (&quot;holometaboly&quot;). While ametabolous insects show very little difference between larval and adult forms (also known as &quot;direct development&quot;), both hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects have significant morphological and behavioral differences between larval and adult forms, the most significant being the inclusion, in holometabolous organisms, of a pupal or resting stage between the larval and adult forms.

=== Development and terminology ===

In hemimetabolous insects, immature stages are called nymphs. Development proceeds in repeated stages of growth and ecdysis (moulting); these stages are called instars. The juvenile forms closely resemble adults, but are smaller and lack adult features such as wings and genitalia. The size and morphological differences between nymphs in different instars are small, often just differences in body proportions and the number of segments; in later instars, external wing buds form. The period from one molt to the next is called a stadium.

In holometabolous insects, immature stages are called larvae and differ markedly from adults. Insects which undergo holometabolism pass through a larval stage, then enter an inactive state called pupa (called a &quot;chrysalis&quot; in butterfly species), and finally emerge as adults.

=== Evolution ===
The earliest insect forms showed direct development (ametabolism), and the evolution of metamorphosis in insects is thought to have fuelled their dramatic radiation (1,2). Some early ametabolous &quot;true insects&quot; are still present today, such as bristletails and silverfish. Hemimetabolous insects include cockroaches, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and true bugs. Phylogenetically, all insects in the Pterygota undergo a marked change in form, texture and physical appearance from immature stage to adult. These insects either have hemimetabolous development, and undergo an incomplete or partial metamorphosis, or holometabolous development, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, including a pupal or resting stage between the larval and adult forms.

A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of holometaboly from hemimetaboly, mostly centering on whether or not the intermediate stages of hemimetabolous forms are homologous in origin to the pupal stage of holometabolous forms.

=== Temperature-dependent metamorphosis ===
According to a 2009 study, temperature plays an important role in insect development as individual species are found to have specific thermal windows that allow them to progress through their developmental stages. These windows are not significantly affected by ecological traits, rather, the windows are phylogenetically adapted to the ecological circumstances insects are living in.

=== Recent research ===

According to research from 2008, adult &quot;Manduca sexta&quot; is able to retain behavior learned as a caterpillar. Another caterpillar, the ornate moth caterpillar, is able to carry toxins that it acquires from its diet through metamorphosis and into adulthood, where the toxins still serve for protection against predators.

Many observations published in 2002, and supported in 2013 indicate that programmed cell death plays a considerable role during physiological processes of multicellular organisms, particularly during embryogenesis, and metamorphosis. Additional research in 2019 found that both autophagy and apoptosis, the two ways programmed cell death occur, are processes undergone during insect metamorphosis. 

Below is the sequence of steps in the metamorphosis of the butterfly (illustrated):
1 – The larva of a butterfly 
2 – The pupa is now spewing the thread to form chrysalis 
3 – The chrysalis is fully formed 
4 – Adult butterfly coming out of the chrysalis


==Chordata==
===Amphioxus===
In cephalochordata, metamorphosis is iodothyronine-induced and it could be an ancestral feature of all chordates.

=== Fish ===
Some fish, both bony fish (Osteichthyes) and jawless fish (Agnatha), undergo metamorphosis. Fish metamorphosis is typically under strong control by the thyroid hormone.

Examples among the non-bony fish include the lamprey. Among the bony fish, mechanisms are varied.

The salmon is diadromous, meaning that it changes from a freshwater to a saltwater lifestyle.

Many species of flatfish begin their life bilaterally symmetrical, with an eye on either side of the body; but one eye moves to join the other side of the fish – which becomes the upper side – in the adult form.

The European eel has a number of metamorphoses, from the larval stage to the leptocephalus stage, then a quick metamorphosis to glass eel at the edge of the continental shelf (eight days for the Japanese eel), two months at the border of fresh and salt water where the glass eel undergoes a quick metamorphosis into elver, then a long stage of growth followed by a more gradual metamorphosis to the migrating phase. In the pre-adult freshwater stage, the eel also has phenotypic plasticity because fish-eating eels develop very wide mandibles, making the head look blunt. Leptocephali are common, occurring in all Elopomorpha (tarpon- and eel-like fish).

Most other bony fish undergo metamorphosis initially from egg to immotile larvae known as &quot;sac fry&quot; (fry with a yolk sac), then to motile larvae (often known as fingerlings due to them roughly reaching the length of a human finger) that have to forage for themselves after the yolk sac resorbs, and then to the juvenile stage where the fish progressively start to resemble adult morphology and behaviors until finally reaching sexual maturity.

=== Amphibians ===

In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads, and newts all hatch from the eggs as larvae with external gills but it will take some time for the amphibians to interact outside with pulmonary respiration. Afterwards, newt larvae start a predatory lifestyle, while tadpoles mostly scrape food off surfaces with their horny tooth ridges.

Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxin concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and prolactin, which counteracts its effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, development is subject to many adaptations due to specific ecological circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges for teeth, whiskers, and fins. They also make use of the lateral line organ. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be resorbed by controlled cell death, called apoptosis. The amount of adaptation to specific ecological circumstances is remarkable, with many discoveries still being made.

==== Frogs and toads ====
With frogs and toads, the external gills of the newly hatched tadpole are covered with a gill sac after a few days, and lungs are quickly formed. Front legs are formed under the gill sac, and hindlegs are visible a few days later. Following that there is usually a longer stage during which the tadpole lives off a vegetarian diet. Tadpoles use a relatively long, spiral‐shaped gut to digest that diet. Recent studies suggest tadpoles do not have a balanced homeostatic feedback control system until the beginning stages of metamorphosis. At this point, their long gut shortens and begins favoring the diet of insects.

Rapid changes in the body can then be observed as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is resorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a big jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, a tongue is formed, and all this is accompanied by associated changes in the neural networks (development of stereoscopic vision, loss of the lateral line system, etc.) All this can happen in about a day. It is not until a few days later that the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxin concentrations required for tail resorption.
==== Salamanders ====
Salamander development is highly diverse; some species go through a dramatic reorganization when transitioning from aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults, while others, such as the axolotl, display pedomorphosis and never develop into terrestrial adults. Within the genus &quot;Ambystoma&quot;, species have evolved to be pedomorphic several times, and pedomorphosis and complete development can both occur in some species.

==== Newts ====
In newts, metamorphosis occurs due to the change in habitat, not a change in diet, because newt larvae already feed as predators and continue doing so as adults. Newts&#x27; gills are never covered by a gill sac and will be resorbed only just before the animal leaves the water. Adults can move faster on land than in water. Newts often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxin. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.

==== Caecilians ====
Basal caecilians such as &quot;Ichthyophis&quot; go through a metamorphosis in which aquatic larva transition into fossorial adults, which involves a loss of the lateral line. More recently diverged caecilians (the Teresomata) do not undergo an ontogenetic niche shift of this sort and are in general fossorial throughout their lives. Thus, most caecilians do not undergo an anuran-like metamorphosis.

<doc id="20869" wikidata="Q410954" url="?curid=20869" title="Monoamine oxidase inhibitor">
<text>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are a class of drugs that inhibit the activity of one or both monoamine oxidase enzymes: monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). They are best known as effective antidepressants, especially for treatment-resistant depression and atypical depression. They are also used to treat panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and several other disorders.

Reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) are a subclass of MAOIs that selectively and reversibly inhibit the MAO-A enzyme. RIMAs are used clinically in the treatment of depression and dysthymia. Due to their reversibility, they are safer in single-drug overdose than the older, irreversible MAOIs, and weaker in increasing the monoamines important in depressive disorder. RIMAs have not gained widespread market share in the United States. 

==Medical uses==
MAOIs have been found to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia, social phobia, atypical depression or mixed anxiety disorder and depression, bulimia, and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as borderline personality disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). MAOIs appear to be particularly effective in the management of bipolar depression according to a retrospective-analysis from 2009. There are reports of MAOI efficacy in OCD, trichotillomania, body dysmorphic disorder, and avoidant personality disorder, but these reports are from uncontrolled case reports.

MAOIs can also be used in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease by targeting MAO-B in particular (therefore affecting dopaminergic neurons), as well as providing an alternative for migraine prophylaxis. Inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B is used in the treatment of clinical depression and anxiety.

MAOIs appear to be particularly indicated for outpatients with dysthymia complicated by panic disorder or hysteroid dysphoria.

Newer MAOIs such as selegiline (typically used in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease) and the reversible MAOI moclobemide provide a safer alternative and are now sometimes used as first-line therapy.

Pargyline is a non-selective MAOI that was previously used as an antihypertensive agent to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).

== Side effects ==

===Hypertensive crisis===
People taking MAOIs generally need to change their diets to limit or avoid foods and beverages containing tyramine. If large amounts of tyramine are consumed, they may develop a hypertensive crisis, which can be fatal. Examples of foods and beverages with potentially high levels of tyramine include cheese, Chianti wine, and pickled fish. Excessive concentrations of tyramine in blood plasma can lead to hypertensive crisis by increasing the release of norepinephrine (NE), which causes blood vessels to constrict by activating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Ordinarily, MAO-A would destroy the excess NE; when MAO-A is inhibited, however, NE levels get too high, leading to dangerous increases in blood pressure.

RIMAs are displaced from MAO-A in the presence of tyramine, rather than inhibiting its breakdown in the liver as general MAOIs do. Additionally, MAO-B remains free and continues to metabolize tyramine in the stomach, although this is less significant than the liver action. Thus, RIMAs are unlikely to elicit tyramine-mediated hypertensive crisis; moreover, dietary modifications are not usually necessary when taking a reversible inhibitor of MAO-A (i.e., moclobemide) or low doses of selective MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline 6 mg/24 hours transdermal patch).

=== Drug interactions ===
The most significant risk associated with the use of MAOIs is the potential for drug interactions with over-the-counter, prescription, or illegally obtained medications, and some dietary supplements (e.g., St. John&#x27;s wort or tryptophan). It is vital that a doctor supervise such combinations to avoid adverse reactions. For this reason, many users carry an MAOI-card, which lets emergency medical personnel know what drugs to avoid (e.g. adrenaline [epinephrine] dosage should be reduced by 75%, and duration is extended).

Tryptophan supplements can be consumed with MAOIs, but can result in transient serotonin syndrome.

MAOIs should not be combined with other psychoactive substances (antidepressants, painkillers, stimulants, including prescribed, OTC and illegally acquired drugs, etc.) except under expert care. Certain combinations can cause lethal reactions; common examples include SSRIs, tricyclics, MDMA, meperidine, tramadol, and dextromethorphan, whereas combinations with LSD, psilocybin, or DMT appear to be relatively safe. Drugs that affect the release or reuptake of epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin or dopamine typically need to be administered at lower doses due to the resulting potentiated and prolonged effect. MAOIs also interact with tobacco-containing products (e.g. cigarettes) and may potentiate the effects of certain compounds in tobacco. This may be reflected in the difficulty of smoking cessation, as tobacco contains naturally occurring MAOI compounds in addition to the nicotine.

While safer than general MAOIs, still possess significant and potentially serious drug interactions with many common drugs; in particular, they can cause serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis when combined with almost any antidepressant or stimulant, common migraine medications, certain herbs, or most cold medicines (including decongestants, antihistamines, and cough syrup).

Ocular alpha-2 agonists such as brimonidine and apraclonidine are glaucoma medications which reduce intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueous production. These alpha-2 agonists should not be given with oral MAOIs due to the risk of hypertensive crisis.

=== Withdrawal ===
Antidepressants including MAOIs have some dependence-producing effects, the most notable one being a discontinuation syndrome, which may be severe especially if MAOIs are discontinued abruptly or too rapidly. The dependence-producing potential of MAOIs or antidepressants in general is not as significant as benzodiazepines. Discontinuation symptoms can be managed by tapering, a gradual reduction in dosage over a period of days, weeks or sometimes months to minimize or prevent withdrawal symptoms.

MAOIs, as with most antidepressant medication, may not alter the course of the disorder in a significant, permanent way, so it is possible that discontinuation can return the patient to the pre-treatment state. This consideration complicates prescribing between an MAOI and an SSRI, because it is necessary to clear the system completely of one drug before starting another. One physician organization recommends the dose to be tapered down over a minimum of four weeks, followed by a two-week washout period. The result is that a depressed patient will have to bear the depression without chemical help during the drug-free interval. This may be preferable to risking the effects of an interaction between the two drugs.

== Mechanism of action ==

MAOIs act by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase, thus preventing the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters and thereby increasing their availability. There are two isoforms of monoamine oxidase, MAO-A and MAO-B. MAO-A preferentially deaminates serotonin, melatonin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. MAO-B preferentially deaminates phenethylamine and certain other trace amines; in contrast, MAO-A preferentially deaminates other trace amines, like tyramine, whereas dopamine is equally deaminated by both types.

=== Reversibility ===
The early MAOIs covalently bound to the monoamine oxidase enzymes, thus inhibiting them irreversibly; the bound enzyme could not function and thus enzyme activity was blocked until the cell made new enzymes. The enzymes turn over approximately every two weeks. A few newer MAOIs, a notable one being moclobemide, are reversible, meaning that they are able to detach from the enzyme to facilitate usual catabolism of the substrate. The level of inhibition in this way is governed by the concentrations of the substrate and the MAOI.

Harmaline found in &quot;Peganum harmala&quot;, &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot;, and &quot;Passiflora incarnata&quot; is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA).

=== Selectivity ===

In addition to reversibility, MAOIs differ by their selectivity of the MAO enzyme subtype. Some MAOIs inhibit both MAO-A and MAO-B equally, other MAOIs have been developed to target one over the other.

MAO-A inhibition reduces the breakdown of primarily serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine; selective inhibition of MAO-A allows for tyramine to be metabolised via MAO-B. Agents that act on serotonin, if taken with another serotonin-enhancing agent, may result in a potentially fatal interaction called serotonin syndrome; if taken with irreversible and unselective inhibitors (such as older MAOIs) a hypertensive crisis may result due to tyramine food interactions. Tyramine is broken down by MAO-A and MAO-B, therefore inhibiting this action may result in its excessive build-up, so diet must be monitored for tyramine intake.

MAO-B inhibition reduces the breakdown mainly of dopamine and phenethylamine, so there are no associated dietary restrictions. MAO-B would also metabolize tyramine, as the only differences between dopamine, phenethylamine, and tyramine are two phenylhydroxyl groups on carbons 3 and 4. The 4-OH would not be a steric hindrance to MAO-B on tyramine. Selegiline is selective for MAO-B at low doses, but non-selective at higher doses.

==History==
The knowledge of MAOIs began with the serendipitous discovery that iproniazid was a potent MAO inhibitor (MAOI). Originally intended for the treatment of tuberculosis, in 1952, iproniazid&#x27;s antidepressant properties were discovered when researchers noted that the depressed patients given iproniazid experienced a relief of their depression. Subsequent in vitro work led to the discovery that it inhibited MAO and eventually to the monoamine theory of depression. MAOIs became widely used as antidepressants in the early 1950s. The discovery of the 2 isoenzymes of MAO has led to the development of selective MAOIs that may have a more favorable side-effect profile.

The older MAOIs&#x27; heyday was mostly between the years 1957 and 1970. The initial popularity of the &#x27;classic&#x27; non-selective irreversible MAO inhibitors began to wane due to their serious interactions with sympathomimetic drugs and tyramine-containing foods that could lead to dangerous hypertensive emergencies. As a result, the use by medical practitioners of these older MAOIs declined. When scientists discovered that there are two different MAO enzymes (MAO-A and MAO-B), they developed selective compounds for MAO-B, (for example, selegiline, which is used for Parkinson&#x27;s disease), to reduce the side-effects and serious interactions. Further improvement occurred with the development of compounds (moclobemide and toloxatone) that not only are selective but cause reversible MAO-A inhibition and a reduction in dietary and drug interactions. Moclobemide, was the first reversible inhibitor of MAO-A to enter widespread clinical practice.

A transdermal patch form of the MAOI selegiline, called Emsam, was approved for use in depression by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States on 28 February 2006.

<doc id="20874" wikidata="Q7175" url="?curid=20874" title="Mycology">
<text>Mycology is the branch of biology concerned with the study of fungi, including their taxonomy, genetics, biochemical properties, and use by humans. Fungi can be a source of tinder, food, traditional medicine, as well as entheogens, poison, and infection. Yeasts are among the most heavily utilized members of the Kingdom Fungi, particularly in food manufacturing.

Mycology branches into the field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases. The two disciplines are closely related, because the vast majority of plant pathogens are fungi. A biologist specializing in mycology is called a mycologist.

== Overview ==
The word &quot;mycology&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek: (&quot;mukēs&quot;), meaning &quot;fungus&quot; and the suffix (&quot;-logia&quot;), meaning &quot;study.&quot; Pioneer mycologists included Elias Magnus Fries, Christiaan Hendrik Persoon, Heinrich Anton de Bary, Elizabeth Eaton Morse, and Lewis David de Schweinitz. Beatrix Potter, author of &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, also made significant contributions to the field.

Pier Andrea Saccardo developed a system for classifying the imperfect fungi by spore color and form, which became the primary system used before classification by DNA analysis. He is most famous for his &quot;Sylloge Fungorum&quot;, which was a comprehensive list of all of the names that had been used for mushrooms. &quot;Sylloge&quot; is still the only work of this kind that was both comprehensive for the botanical kingdom Fungi and reasonably modern.

Many fungi produce toxins, antibiotics, and other secondary metabolites. For example, the cosmopolitan genus &quot;Fusarium&quot; and their toxins associated with fatal outbreaks of alimentary toxic aleukia in humans were extensively studied by Abraham Z. Joffe.

Fungi are fundamental for life on earth in their roles as symbionts, e.g. in the form of mycorrhizae, insect symbionts, and lichens. Many fungi are able to break down complex organic biomolecules such as lignin, the more durable component of wood, and pollutants such as xenobiotics, petroleum, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. By decomposing these molecules, fungi play a critical role in the global carbon cycle.

Fungi and other organisms traditionally recognized as fungi, such as oomycetes and myxomycetes (slime molds), often are economically and socially important, as some cause diseases of animals (including humans) and of plants.

Apart from pathogenic fungi, many fungal species are very important in controlling the plant diseases caused by different pathogens. For example, species of the filamentous fungal genus &quot;Trichoderma&quot; are considered one of the most important biological control agents as an alternative to chemical-based products for effective crop diseases management.

Field meetings to find interesting species of fungi are known as &#x27;forays&#x27;, after the first such meeting organized by the Woolhope Naturalists&#x27; Field Club in 1868 and entitled &quot;A foray among the funguses&quot;.

Some fungi can cause disease in humans and other animals; the study of pathogenic fungi that infect animals is referred to as medical mycology.

==History==
It is believed that humans started collecting mushrooms as food in prehistoric times. Mushrooms were first written about in the works of Euripides (480–406 BC). The Greek philosopher Theophrastos of Eresos (371–288 BC) was perhaps the first to try to systematically classify plants; mushrooms were considered to be plants missing certain organs. It was later Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), who wrote about truffles in his encyclopedia &quot;Natural History&quot;.

The Middle Ages saw little advancement in the body of knowledge about fungi. However, the invention of the printing press allowed authors to dispel superstitions and misconceptions about the fungi that had been perpetuated by the classical authors.

The start of the modern age of mycology begins with Pier Antonio Micheli&#x27;s 1737 publication of &quot;Nova plantarum genera&quot;. Published in Florence, this seminal work laid the foundations for the systematic classification of grasses, mosses and fungi. He originated the still current genus names &quot;Polyporus&quot; and &quot;Tuber&quot;, both dated 1729 (though the descriptions were later amended as invalid by modern rules).

The founding nomenclaturist Carl Linnaeus included fungi in his binomial naming system in 1753, where each type of organism has a two-word name consisting of a genus and species (whereas up to then organisms were often designated with Latin phrases containing many words). He originated the scientific names of numerous well-known mushroom taxa, such as &quot;Boletus&quot; and &quot;Agaricus&quot;, which are still in use today. During this period, fungi were still considered to belong to the plant kingdom, so they were categorized in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. Linnaeus&#x27; fungal taxa were not nearly as comprehensive as his plant taxa, however, grouping together all gilled mushrooms with a stem in genus &quot;Agaricus&quot;. Thousands of gilled species exist, which were later divided into dozens of diverse genera; in its modern usage, &quot;Agaricus&quot; only refers to mushrooms closely related to the common shop mushroom, &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot;. For example, Linnaeus gave the name &quot;Agaricus deliciosus&quot; to the saffron milk-cap, but its current name is &quot;Lactarius deliciosus&quot;. On the other hand, the field mushroom &quot;Agaricus campestris&quot; has kept the same name ever since Linnaeus&#x27;s publication. The English word &quot;agaric&quot; is still used for any gilled mushroom, which corresponds to Linnaeus&#x27;s use of the word.

Although mycology was historically considered a branch of botany, the 1969 discovery of fungi&#x27;s close evolutionary relationship to animals resulted in the study&#x27;s reclassification as an independent field. The term &quot;mycology&quot; and the complementary term &quot;mycologist&quot; are traditionally attributed to M.J. Berkeley in 1836. However, &quot;mycologist&quot; appeared in writings by English botanist Robert Kaye Greville as early as 1823 in reference to Schweinitz.

== Scope and importance ==
===Production, trade, and food manufacturing===
Lumber and timber products are a key element of international trade, as they are used for all things from architecture to firewood. The cultivation of forested ecosystems to produce this amount of usable wood is highly dependent on the mycorrhizal symbiotic relationships between plants, specifically trees, and fungi. The fungi provide a great number of benefits to their symbiotic plant partner, such as disease tolerance, improved growth and mineral nutrition, stress tolerance, and even fertilizer utilization.

Another major component of international trade over recent years has been edible and medicinal mushrooms. While many fungal species can be cultivated in large farming installations, the cultivation of some coveted species has yet to be fully understood, which means that there are many species that can only be found naturally in the wild. While the demand of wild mushroom species has increased worldwide over recent years, the rarity of these species has not changed. Even still, mushroom hunting has become a key factor in local economies.

Increased scientific knowledge of fungal diversity has led to biotechnological advances in food manufacturing. Humans have utilized this knowledge by cultivating various types of fungi, particularly yeasts. There are over 500 species of yeasts that have been cultivated for different purposes, the most common of which is &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, also known as baker&#x27;s yeast. As its common name suggests, &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has been used for winemaking, baking, and brewing since ancient times.

Fermentation is one of the earliest forms of food preservation, with the earliest recorded use dating back over 13,000 years ago in Israel. The cultivation of bacteria and fungi, particularly yeasts, have been used for centuries to increase the storage life of meats, vegetables, grains, and other foods. Fermentation also plays a significant role in the production of various food products and alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine. About 90% of the world&#x27;s beer production comes from lager beer and 5% from ale beer, while the rest is from spontaneous fermentation of a variety of yeasts and bacteria. Production of alcoholic beverages play significant roles in the economics of many countries, with beer often being a crucial export.

===Plant pathogenic fungi===
Plant pathogenic fungi are a serious threat when it comes to crop availability and food security. These fungi can infiltrate plants and food crops, which can cause serious economic issues for agricultural industries in numerous countries. Various plant pathogens can cause cash crops to become inedible and virtually useless to the farmer that is growing them. This problem has increased over the years as the usage of monocultures have become more prevalent: a limited variety of plants in one area can lead to the rapid spread of specific pathogens. &quot;Puccinia graminis&quot; is a type of stem rust that targets wheat crops worldwide from Africa to Europe. Another devastating fungal pathogen is &quot;Sarocladium oryzae&quot;, which is a type of sheath rot fungus prevalent in India and is a great threat to rice cultivation. Historically, one of the more well-known cases of plant-fungal pandemics was the potato blight of Ireland, which was caused by a water mold known as &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;. This event is known as the Great Famine of Ireland.

==Mycology and drug discovery==

For centuries, certain mushrooms have been documented as a folk medicine in China, Japan, and Russia. Although the use of mushrooms in folk medicine is centered largely on the Asian continent, people in other parts of the world like the Middle East, Poland, and Belarus have been documented using mushrooms for medicinal purposes.

Mushrooms produce large amounts of vitamin D when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. Penicillin, ciclosporin, griseofulvin, cephalosporin and psilocybin are examples of drugs that have been isolated from molds or other fungi.

<text>Melancholia or melancholy (from &#x27;, meaningblack bile) is a concept found throughout ancient, medieval, and premodern medicine in Europe that describes a condition characterized by markedly depressed mood, bodily complaints, and sometimes hallucinations and delusions.

Melancholy was regarded as one of the four temperaments matching the four humours. Until the 18th century, doctors and other scholars classified melancholic conditions as such by their perceived common causean excess of a notional fluid known as &quot;black bile&quot;, which was commonly linked to the spleen. Hippocrates and other ancient physicians described melancholia as a distinct disease with mental and physical symptoms, including persistent fears and despondencies, poor appetite, abulia, sleeplessness, irritability, and agitation. Later, fixed delusions were added by Galen and other physicians to the list of symptoms. In the Middle Ages, the understanding of melancholia shifted to a religious perspective, with sadness seen as a vice and demonic possession, rather than somatic causes, as a potential cause of the disease.

During the late 16th and early 17th centuries, a cultural and literary cult of melancholia emerged in England, linked to Neoplatonist and humanist Marsilio Ficino&#x27;s transformation of melancholia from a sign of vice into a mark of genius. This fashionable melancholy became a prominent theme in literature, art, and music of the era .

Between the late 18th and late 19th centuries, &quot;melancholia&quot; was a common medical diagnosis. In this period, the focus was on the abnormal beliefs associated with the disorder, rather than depression and affective symptoms. In the 19th century, melancholia was considered to be rooted in subjective &#x27;passions&#x27; that seemingly caused disordered mood (in contrast to modern biomedical explanations for mood disorders). In Victorian Britain, the notion of melancholia as a disease evolved as it became increasingly classifiable and diagnosable with a set list of symptoms that contributed to a biomedical model for the understanding mental disease. However, in the 20th century, the focus again shifted, and the term became used essentially as a synonym for depression. Indeed, modern concepts of depression as a mood disorder eventually arose from this historical context. Today, the term &quot;melancholia&quot; and &quot;melancholic&quot; are still used in medical diagnostic classification, such as in ICD-11 and DSM-5, to specify certain features that may be present in major depression.

Related terms used in historical medicine include lugubriousness (from Latin &quot;&quot;: &quot;to mourn&quot;), moroseness (from Latin &quot;&quot;: &quot;self-will or fastidious habit&quot;), wistfulness (from a blend of &quot;wishful&quot; and the obsolete English &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;intently&quot;), and saturnineness (from Latin &quot;&quot;: &quot;of the planet Saturn).

==Early history==

The name &quot;melancholia&quot; comes from the old medical belief of the four humours: disease or ailment being caused by an imbalance in one or more of the four basic bodily liquids, or humours. Personality types were similarly determined by the dominant humor in a particular person. According to Hippocrates and subsequent tradition, melancholia was caused by an excess of black bile, hence the name, which means &quot;black bile&quot;, from Ancient Greek μέλας (), &quot;dark, black&quot;, and χολή (), &quot;bile&quot;; a person whose constitution tended to have a preponderance of black bile had a &quot;melancholic&quot; disposition. In the complex elaboration of humorist theory, it was associated with the earth from the Four Elements, the season of autumn, the spleen as the originating organ and cold and dry as related qualities. In astrology it showed the influence of Saturn, hence the related adjective &quot;saturnine&quot;.

Melancholia was described as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Hippocrates, in his &quot;&quot;, characterized all &quot;fears and despondencies, if they last a long time&quot; as being symptomatic of melancholia. Other symptoms mentioned by Hippocrates include: poor appetite, abulia, sleeplessness, irritability, agitation. The Hippocratic clinical description of melancholia shows significant overlaps with contemporary nosography of depressive syndromes (6 symptoms out of the 9 included in DSM diagnostic criteria for a Major Depressive).

In ancient Rome, Galen added &quot;fixed delusions&quot; to the set of symptoms listed by Hippocrates. Galen also believed that melancholia caused cancer. Aretaeus of Cappadocia, in turn, believed that melancholia involved both a state of anguish, and a delusion. In the 10th century Persian physician Al-Akhawayni Bokhari described melancholia as a chronic illness caused by the impact of black bile on the brain. He described melancholia&#x27;s initial clinical manifestations as &quot;suffering from an unexplained fear, inability to answer questions or providing false answers, self-laughing and self-crying and speaking meaninglessly, yet with no fever.&quot;

In Middle-Ages Europe, the humoral, somatic paradigm for understanding sustained sadness lost primacy in front of the prevailing religious perspective. Sadness came to be a vice (λύπη in the Greek vice list by Evagrius Ponticus, tristitia vel acidia in the 7 vice list by Pope Gregory I). When a patient could not be cured of the disease it was thought that the melancholia was a result of demonic possession.

In his study of French and Burgundian courtly culture, Johan Huizinga noted that &quot;at the close of the Middle Ages, a sombre melancholy weighs on people&#x27;s souls.&quot; In chronicles, poems, sermons, even in legal documents, an immense sadness, a note of despair and a fashionable sense of suffering and deliquescence at the approaching end of times, suffuses court poets and chroniclers alike: Huizinga quotes instances in the ballads of Eustache Deschamps, &quot;monotonous and gloomy variations of the same dismal theme&quot;, and in Georges Chastellain&#x27;s prologue to his Burgundian chronicle, and in the late 15th-century poetry of Jean Meschinot. Ideas of reflection and the workings of imagination are blended in the term &quot;merencolie&quot;, embodying for contemporaries &quot;a tendency&quot;, observes Huizinga, &quot;to identify all serious occupation of the mind with sadness&quot;.

Painters were considered by Vasari and other writers to be especially prone to melancholy by the nature of their work, sometimes with good effects for their art in increased sensitivity and use of fantasy. Among those of his contemporaries so characterised by Vasari were Pontormo and Parmigianino, but he does not use the term of Michelangelo, who used it, perhaps not very seriously, of himself. A famous allegorical engraving by Albrecht Dürer is entitled &quot;Melencolia I&quot;. This engraving has been interpreted as portraying melancholia as the state of waiting for inspiration to strike, and not necessarily as a depressive affliction. Amongst other allegorical symbols, the picture includes a magic square and a truncated rhombohedron. The image in turn inspired a passage in &quot;The City of Dreadful Night&quot; by James Thomson (B.V.), and, a few years later, a sonnet by Edward Dowden.

The most extended treatment of melancholia comes from Robert Burton, whose &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; (1621) treats the subject from both a literary and a medical perspective. His concept of melancholia includes all mental illness, which he divides into different types. Burton wrote in the 17th century that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness.
In the Encyclopédie of Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert, the causes of melancholia are stated to be similar to those that cause Mania: &quot;grief, pains of the spirit, passions, as well as all the love and sexual appetites that go unsatisfied.&quot;

==English cultural movement==

During the later 16th and early 17th centuries, a curious cultural and literary cult of melancholia arose in England. In an influential 1964 essay in Apollo, art historian Roy Strong traced the origins of this fashionable melancholy to the thought of the popular Neoplatonist and humanist Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499), who replaced the medieval notion of melancholia with something new: 

&quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; (&quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy, What it is: With all the Kinds, Causes, Symptomes, Prognostickes, and Several Cures of it... Philosophically, Medicinally, Historically, Opened and Cut Up&quot;) by Burton, was first published in 1621 and remains a defining literary monument to the fashion. Another major English author who made extensive expression upon being of an melancholic disposition is Sir Thomas Browne in his &quot;Religio Medici&quot; (1643).

&quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; (&quot;The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts on Life, Death, &amp; Immortality&quot;), a long poem in blank verse by Edward Young was published in nine parts (or &quot;nights&quot;) between 1742 and 1745, and hugely popular in several languages. It had a considerable influence on early Romantics in England, France and Germany. William Blake was commissioned to illustrate a later edition.

In the visual arts, this fashionable intellectual melancholy occurs frequently in portraiture of the era, with sitters posed in the form of &quot;the lover, with his crossed arms and floppy hat over his eyes, and the scholar, sitting with his head resting on his hand&quot;descriptions drawn from the frontispiece to the 1638 edition of Burton&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy&quot;, which shows just such by-then stock characters. These portraits were often set out of doors where Nature provides &quot;the most suitable background for spiritual contemplation&quot; or in a gloomy interior.

In music, the post-Elizabethan cult of melancholia is associated with John Dowland, whose motto was &quot;Semper Dowland, semper dolens&quot; (&quot;Always Dowland, always mourning&quot;). The melancholy man, known to contemporaries as a &quot;malcontent&quot;, is epitomized by Shakespeare&#x27;s Prince Hamlet, the &quot;Melancholy Dane&quot;.

A similar phenomenon, though not under the same name, occurred during the German &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement, with such works as &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; by Goethe or in Romanticism with works such as &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot; by John Keats or in Symbolism with works such as &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; by Arnold Böcklin. In the 20th century, much of the counterculture of modernism was fueled by comparable alienation and a sense of purposelessness called &quot;anomie&quot;; earlier artistic preoccupation with death has gone under the rubric of memento mori. The medieval condition of acedia (&quot;acedie&quot; in English) and the Romantic Weltschmerz were similar concepts, most likely to affect the intellectual.

==Modern connotations==
Until the 18th century, writings on melancholia were mainly concerned with beliefs that were considered abnormal, rather than affective symptoms.

Melancholia was a category that &quot;the well-to-do, the sedentary, and the studious were even more liable to be placed in the eighteenth century than they had been in preceding centuries.&quot;

In the 20th century, &quot;melancholia&quot; lost its attachment to abnormal beliefs, and in common usage became entirely a synonym for depression. Sigmund Freud published a paper on Mourning and Melancholia in 1918.

In 1907, the German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin influentially proposed the existence of a condition he called &#x27;involutional melancholia&#x27;, which he thought could help explain the more frequent occurrence of depression among elderly people. He surmised that in the elderly &quot;the processes of involution in the body are suited to engender mournful or anxious moodiness&quot;, though by 1913 he had returned to his earlier view (first expounded in 1899) that age-related depression could be understood in terms of manic-depressive illness.

In 1996, Gordon Parker and Dusan Hadzi-Pavlovic described &quot;melancholia&quot; as a specific disorder of movement and mood. They attached the term to the concept of &quot;endogenous depression&quot; (claimed to be caused by internal forces rather than environmental influences).

In 2006, Michael Alan Taylor and Max Fink also defined melancholia as a systemic disorder that could be identified by depressive mood rating scales, verified by the presence of abnormal cortisol metabolism. They considered it to be characterized by depressed mood, abnormal motor functions, and abnormal vegetative signs, and they described several forms, including retarded depression, psychotic depression and postpartum depression.

===Melancholic depression===

For the purposes of medical diagnostic classification, the terms &quot;melancholia&quot; and &quot;melancholic&quot; are still in use (for example, in ICD-11 and DSM-5) to specify certain features that may be present in major depression, referred to as depression with melancholic features such as:
* severely depressed mood, wherein the person often feels despondent, forlorn, disconsolate, or empty
* pervasive anhedonia – loss of interest or pleasure in most activities that are normally enjoyable
* lack of emotional responsiveness (mood does not brighten, even briefly) to normally pleasurable stimuli (such as food or entertainment) or situations (such as warm, affectionate interactions with friends or family)
* terminal insomnia – unwanted early morning awakening (two or more hours earlier than normal)
* marked psychomotor retardation or agitation
* marked loss of appetite or weight loss

A specifier essentially is a subcategory of a disease, explaining specific features or symptoms that are added to the main diagnosis. According to the DSM-IV, the &quot;melancholic features&quot; specifier may be applied to the following only:
# Major depressive episode, single episode
# Major depressive episode, recurrent episode
# Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode depressed
# Bipolar II disorder, most recent episode depressed
It is important to note, however, that people who suffer from melancholic depression do not need to have melancholic features in every depressive episode.

====Signs and symptoms====
Melancholic depression requires at least one of the following symptoms during the last depressive episode:
* Anhedonia (the inability to find pleasure in positive things)
* Lack of mood reactivity (i.e. mood does not improve in response to positive/desired events; failure to feel better)
And at least three of the following:
* Depressed mood that is subjectively different from grief or loss (marked by despair, gloominess, and &quot;empty-mood&quot;)
* Severe weight loss or loss of appetite
* Psychomotor agitation or retardation (i.e. increased or decreased movement, speech, and cognitive function)
* Early morning awakening (i.e. waking up at least 2 hours before the normal wake up time of the patient)
* Guilt that is excessive
* Worse depressed mood in the morning
Melancholic features apply to an episode of depression that occurs as part of either major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), or bipolar disorder I or II. They are more likely to occur in patients who suffer from depression with psychotic features. People with melancholic depression also tend to have more physically visible symptoms such as slower movement or speech.

====Causes====
The causes of melancholic depressive disorder are believed to be mostly biological factors that can be hereditary. Biological origins of the condition include problems with the HPA axis and sleep structure of patients. MRI studies have indicated that melancholic depressed patients have issues with the connections between different regions of the brain, specifically the insula and fronto-parietal cortex. Some studies have found that there are biological marker differences between patients with melancholic depression and other subtypes of depression.

The research regarding melancholic depression consistently finds that men are more likely to receive a melancholic depression diagnosis.

====Treatment====
Melancholic depression, due to some fundamental differences with standard clinical depression or other subtypes of depression, has specific types of treatments that work, and the success rates for different treatments can vary. Treatment can involve antidepressants and empirically supported treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy for depression.

Melancholic depression is often considered to be a biologically based and particularly severe form of depression. Therefore, the treatments for this specifier of depression are more biomedical and less psychosocial (which would include talk therapy and social support). The general initial or &quot;ideal&quot; treatment for melancholic depression is antidepressant medication, and psychotherapy is added later on as support if at all. The scientific support for medication as the best treatment is that patients with melancholic depression are less likely to improve with placebos, unlike other depression patients. This indicates the improvements observed after medication actually come from the biological basis of the condition and the treatment. There are several types of antidepressants that can be prescribed including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAOIs; the antidepressants tend to vary on how they work and what specific chemical messengers in the brain they target. SNRIs are generally more effective than SSRIs because they target more than one chemical messenger (serotonin and norepinephrine).

Although psychotherapy treatments can be used such as talk therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), they have shown to be less effective than medication. In a randomized clinical trial, it was shown that CBT was less effective than medication in treating symptoms of melancholic depression after 12 weeks.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was previously believed to be an effective treatment for melancholic depression. ECT has been more commonly used for patients with melancholic depression due to the severity. In 2010, a study found that 60% of depression patients treated with ECT had melancholic symptoms. However, studies since the 2000s have failed to demonstrate positive treatment results from ECT, although studies also indicate a more positive response to ECT in melancholic patients than other depressed patients.

It has been observed in studies that patients with melancholic depression tend to recover less often than other types of depression.

====Frequency====
The prevalence of having the melancholic depression specifier among patients diagnosed with clinical depression is estimated to be about 25% to 30%. 

The incidence of melancholic depression has been found to increase when the temperature and/or sunlight are low.

<text>Mimosa is a genus of about 600 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae. Species are native to the Americas, from North Dakota to northern Argentina, and to eastern Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique, and Madagascar) as well as the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. The generic name is derived from the Greek word (&quot;mimos&quot;), &#x27;actor&#x27; or &#x27;mime&#x27;, and the feminine suffix -&quot;osa&quot;, &#x27;resembling&#x27;, suggesting its &#x27;sensitive leaves&#x27; which seem to &#x27;mimic conscious life&#x27;.

Two species in the genus are especially notable. One is &quot;Mimosa pudica&quot;, commonly known as touch-me-not, which folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat. It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas, notably Hawaii. The other is &quot;Mimosa tenuiflora&quot;, which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomy of the genus &quot;Mimosa&quot; has gone through several periods of splitting and lumping, ultimately accumulating over 3,000 names, many of which have either been synonymized under other species or transferred to other genera. In part due to these changing circumscriptions, the name &quot;Mimosa&quot; has also been applied to several other related species with similar pinnate or bipinnate leaves, but are now classified in other genera. The most common examples of this are &quot;Albizia julibrissin&quot; (Persian silk tree) and &quot;Acacia dealbata&quot; (wattle).

==Description==

Members of this genus are among the few plants capable of rapid movement; examples outside of &quot;Mimosa&quot; include the telegraph plant, &quot;Aldrovanda&quot;, some species of &quot;Drosera&quot; and the Venus flytrap. The leaves of the &quot;Mimosa pudica&quot; close quickly when touched. Some mimosas raise their leaves in the day and lower them at night, and experiments done by Jean-Jacques d&#x27;Ortous de Mairan on mimosas in 1729 provided the first evidence of biological clocks.

&quot;Mimosa&quot; can be distinguished from the large related genera, &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Albizia&quot;, since its flowers have ten or fewer stamens. Botanically, what appears to be a single globular flower is actually a cluster of many individual ones. Mimosas contain some level of heptanoic acid.

<doc id="20879" wikidata="Q1414032" url="?curid=20879" title="Manhattan (cocktail)">
<text>A Manhattan is a cocktail made with whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters. While rye is the traditional whiskey of choice, other commonly used whiskies include Canadian whisky, bourbon, blended whiskey, and Tennessee whiskey. The cocktail is usually stirred with ice then strained into a chilled cocktail glass and garnished traditionally with a maraschino cherry. A Manhattan may also be served on the rocks in a lowball glass.

The whiskey-based Manhattan is one of five cocktails named for a New York City borough. It is closely related to the Brooklyn cocktail, which uses dry vermouth and Maraschino liqueur in place of the Manhattan&#x27;s sweet vermouth, and Amer Picon in place of the Manhattan&#x27;s angostura bitters.

The Manhattan is one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury&#x27;s 1948 classic &quot;The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks&quot;.

==Origin and history==
Popular history suggests that the drink originated at the Manhattan Club in New York City in the mid-1870s, where it was invented by Iain Marshall for a banquet hosted by Jennie Jerome (Lady Randolph Churchill, mother of Winston) in honor of presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden. The success of the banquet made the drink fashionable, later prompting several people to request the drink by referring to the name of the club where it originated—&quot;the &quot;Manhattan&quot; cocktail&quot;. However, Lady Randolph was in France at the time and pregnant, so the story is likely to be fiction.

However, there are prior references to various similar cocktail recipes called &quot;Manhattan&quot; and served in the Manhattan area. By one account it was invented in the 1860s by a bartender named Black at a bar on Broadway near Houston Street.

Some of the earliest records of the cocktail can be found in Charlie Paul&#x27;s &quot;American and other Drinks&quot; and O.H. Byron&#x27;s &quot;The Modern Bartender&#x27;s Guide&quot;, both written in 1884. Paul describes it containing &quot;three or four drops of angostura bitters, ditto of plain syrup; add half a liqueur glass of vermouth, half wine glassful of Scotch whiskey&quot; and garnished with lemon. Byron describes two versions, one with French vermouth and the other with Italian. Another early record of the cocktail can be found in William Schmidt&#x27;s &quot;The Flowing Bowl&quot;, published in 1891. In it, he details a drink containing 2 dashes of gum (gomme syrup), 2 dashes of bitters, 1 dash of absinthe, portion of whiskey, and portion of vermouth.

The same cocktail appears listed as a &quot;Tennessee Cocktail&quot; in &quot;Shake &#x27;em Up!&quot; by V. Elliott and P. Strong: &quot;Two parts of whiskey, one part of Italian Vermouth, and a dash of bitters poured over ice and stirred vigorously.&quot;

During Prohibition (1920–1933) Canadian whisky was primarily used because it was available.

==Traditions==
On the small North Frisian island of Föhr, the Manhattan cocktail is a standard drink at almost every cafe, restaurant, and &quot;get together&quot; of locals. The story goes that many of the people of Föhr emigrated to Manhattan during deep sea fishing trips, took a liking to the drink, and brought it back to Föhr with them. The drink is usually mixed 1 part vermouth to 2 parts whiskey, with a dash of bitters, served ice cold, in an ice cold glass, or with ice and a cherry garnish.

==Variations==
Traditional views insist that a Manhattan be made with American rye whiskey. However it can also be made with bourbon or Canadian whisky. The Manhattan is subject to considerable variation and innovation, and is often a way for the best bartenders to show off their creativity. Some shake the ingredients with ice in a cocktail shaker instead of stirring it, creating a froth on the surface of the drink. Angostura is the classic bitters, but orange bitters or Peychaud&#x27;s Bitters may be used. Some make their own bitters and syrups, substitute comparable digestifs in place of vermouth, specialize in local or rare whiskeys, or use other exotic ingredients. A lemon peel may be used as garnish. Some add juice from the cherry jar or Maraschino liqueur to the cocktail for additional sweetness and color.

Originally, bitters were considered an integral part of any cocktail, as the ingredient that differentiated a cocktail from a sling. Over time, those definitions of &quot;cocktail&quot; and &quot;sling&quot; have become archaic, as &quot;sling&quot; has fallen out of general use (other than in certain drink names), and &quot;cocktail&quot; can mean any drink that resembles a martini, or simply any mixed drink.

The following are other variations on the classic Manhattan: 
* Black Manhattan – replaces vermouth with Averna amaro, add one dash orange bitters (in addition to one dash Angostura bitters). Created in 2005 at San Francisco bar Bourbon &amp; Branch by bartender Todd Smith.
* Blonde Manhattan – made with 2 oz moonshine, 1 oz sweet vermouth, 0.5 oz orange liqueur, and 3 dashes of orange bitters.
* Brandy Manhattan – made with brandy instead of whiskey, and is very popular in Wisconsin.
* Cuban Manhattan – a perfect Manhattan (see below) with dark rum as its principal ingredient.
* Dean Lyder – a twist on the perfect Manhattan, made with orange bitters and zest, giving it a &#x27;big, bold character&#x27;. It is named for Courtney Lyder, dean of UCLA School of Nursing.
* Dry Manhattan – made with dry vermouth instead of sweet vermouth, usually also replacing the maraschino cherry with a twist in keeping with the overall principle of reducing the cocktail&#x27;s sweetness. A Manhattan made with dry vermouth but retaining the cherry rather than twist is sometimes known as a &quot;half-dry Manhattan&quot;, but this name risks confusion with the perfect Manhattan, whose quantity of vermouth consists of equal parts sweet vermouth and dry vermouth.
* Fanciulli – adds the bitter flavors of Fernet-Branca.
* The Fourth Regiment – a classic (ca. 1889) cocktail that uses a 1:1 ratio of whiskey and vermouth, and uses three dashes of three different bitters – orange bitters, celery bitters, and Peychaud&#x27;s Bitters.
* Metropolitan – similar to a brandy Manhattan, but with a 3-to-1 ratio of brandy to vermouth and a dash of simple syrup.
* Perfect Manhattan – made with equal parts sweet and dry vermouth.
* Rob Roy – made with Scotch whisky.
* Manhattan Project - to a standard Manhattan, add ½ oz cherry brandy.

<text>Mira (), designation Omicron Ceti (ο Ceti, abbreviated Omicron Cet, ο Cet), is a red-giant star estimated to be 200–300 light-years from the Sun in the constellation Cetus.

ο Ceti is a binary stellar system, consisting of a variable red giant (Mira A) along with a white dwarf companion (Mira B). Mira A is a pulsating variable star and was the first non-supernova variable star discovered, with the possible exception of Algol. It is the prototype of the Mira variables.

==Nomenclature==
ο Ceti (Latinised to &quot;Omicron Ceti&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. It was named Mira (Latin for &#x27;wonderful&#x27; or &#x27;astonishing&#x27;) by Johannes Hevelius in his &quot;Historiola Mirae Stellae&quot; (1662). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included Mira for this star.
==Observation history==

Evidence that the variability of Mira was known in ancient China, Babylon or Greece is at best only circumstantial. What is certain is that the variability of Mira was recorded by the astronomer David Fabricius beginning on August 3, 1596. Observing what he thought was the planet Mercury (later identified as Jupiter), he needed a reference star for comparing positions and picked a previously unremarked third-magnitude star nearby. By August 21, however, it had increased in brightness by one magnitude, then by October had faded from view. Fabricius assumed it was a nova, but then saw it again on February 16, 1609.

In 1638 Johannes Holwarda determined a period of the star&#x27;s reappearances, eleven months; he is often credited with the discovery of Mira&#x27;s variability. Johannes Hevelius was observing it at the same time and named it Mira in 1662, for it acted like no other known star. Ismail Bouillaud then estimated its period at 333 days, less than one day off the modern value of 332 days. Bouillaud&#x27;s measurement may not have been erroneous: Mira is known to vary slightly in period, and may even be slowly changing over time. The star is estimated to be a six-billion-year-old red giant.
There is considerable speculation as to whether Mira had been observed prior to Fabricius. Certainly Algol&#x27;s history (known for certain as a variable only in 1667, but with legends and such dating back to antiquity showing that it had been observed with suspicion for millennia) suggests that Mira might have been known, too. Karl Manitius, a modern translator of Hipparchus&#x27; &quot;Commentary on Aratus&quot;, has suggested that certain lines from that second-century text may be about Mira. The other pre-telescopic Western catalogs of Ptolemy, al-Sufi, Ulugh Beg and Tycho Brahe turn up no mentions, even as a regular star. There are three observations from Chinese and Korean archives, in 1596, 1070 and the same year when Hipparchus would have made his observation (134 BC) that are suggestive.

An estimate obtained in 1925 from interferometry by Francis G. Pease at the Mount Wilson Observatory gave Mira a diameter of 250-260 million miles (402 to 418 million km, or approximately ), making it the then-second largest star known and comparable to historical estimates of Betelgeuse, surpassed only by Antares. On the contrary, Otto Struve thought of Mira as a red supergiant with an approximate radius of , while modern consensus accepts Mira to be a highly evolved asymptotic giant branch star.

==Distance and background Information ==
Pre-&quot;Hipparcos&quot; estimates centered on 220 light-years; while Hipparcos data from the 2007 reduction suggest a distance of 299 light-years, with a margin of error of 11%. The age of Mira is suspected to be about 6 billion years old. Its gaseous material is scattered, as much as one-thousandth as thin as the air around us. Mira is also among the coolest known bright stars of the red giant class, with a temperature ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,600 to 2,200 degrees Celsius). As with other long-period variables, Mira&#x27;s deep red color at minimum pales to a lighter orange as the star brightens. Within the next few million years, Mira will discard its outer layers and become a planetary nebula, leaving behind a white dwarf.

==Stellar system==
This binary star system consists of a red giant (Mira, designated Mira A) undergoing mass loss and a high-temperature white dwarf companion (Mira B) that is accreting mass from the primary. Such an arrangement of stars is known as a symbiotic system and this is the closest such symbiotic pair to the Sun. Examination of this system by the Chandra X-ray Observatory shows a direct mass exchange along a bridge of matter from the primary to the white dwarf. The two stars are currently separated by about 70 astronomical units.

===Component A===

Mira A is currently an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, in the thermally pulsing AGB phase. Each pulse lasts a decade or more, and an amount of time on the order of 10,000 years passes between each pulse. With every pulse cycle Mira increases in luminosity and the pulses grow stronger. This is also causing dynamic instability in Mira, resulting in dramatic changes in luminosity and size over shorter, irregular time periods.

The overall shape of Mira A has been observed to change, exhibiting pronounced departures from symmetry. These appear to be caused by bright spots on the surface that evolve their shape on time scales of 3–14 months. Observations of Mira A in the ultraviolet band by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown a plume-like feature pointing toward the companion star.

====Variability====

Mira A is a variable star, specifically the prototypical Mira variable. The 6,000 to 7,000 known stars of this class are all red giants whose surfaces pulsate in such a way as to increase and decrease in brightness over periods ranging from about 80 to more than 1,000 days.

In the particular case of Mira, its increases in brightness take it up to about magnitude 3.5 on average, placing it among the brighter stars in the Cetus constellation. Individual cycles vary too; well-attested maxima go as high as magnitude 2.0 in brightness and as low as 4.9, a range almost 15 times in brightness, and there are historical suggestions that the real spread may be three times this or more. Minima range much less, and have historically been between 8.6 and 10.1, a factor of four times in luminosity. The total swing in brightness from absolute maximum to absolute minimum (two events which did not occur on the same cycle) is 1,700 times. Mira emits the vast majority of its radiation in the infrared, and its variability in that band is only about two magnitudes. The shape of its light curve is of an increase over about 100 days, and the return to minimum taking twice as long. Contemporary approximate maxima for Mira:

From northern temperate latitudes, Mira is generally not visible between late March and June due to its proximity to the Sun. This means that at times several years can pass without it appearing as a naked-eye object.

The pulsations of Mira variables cause the star to expand and contract, but also to change its temperature. The temperature is highest slightly after the visual maximum, and lowest slightly before minimum. The photosphere, measured at the Rosseland radius, is smallest just before visual maximum and close to the time of maximum temperature. The largest size is reached slightly before the time of lowest temperature. The bolometric luminosity is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature and the square of the radius, but the radius varies by over 20% and the temperature by less than 10%.

In Mira, the highest luminosity occurs close to the time when the star is hottest and smallest. The visual magnitude is determined both by the luminosity and by the proportion of the radiation that occurs at visual wavelengths. Only a small proportion of the radiation is emitted at visual wavelengths and this proportion is very strongly influenced by the temperature (Planck&#x27;s law). Combined with the overall luminosity changes, this creates the very big visual magnitude variation with the maximum occurring when the temperature is high.

Infrared VLTI measurements of Mira at phases 0.13, 0.18, 0.26, 0.40 and 0.47, show that the radius varies from at phase 0.13 just after maximum to at phase 0.40 approaching minimum. The temperature at phase 0.13 is and at phase 0.26 about halfway from maximum to minimum. The luminosity is calculated to be at phase 0.13 and at phase 0.26.

The pulsations of Mira have the effect of expanding its photosphere by around 50% compared to a non-pulsating star. In the case of Mira, if it was not pulsating it is modelled to have a radius of only around .

====Mass loss====
Ultraviolet studies of Mira by NASA&#x27;s Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) space telescope have revealed that it sheds a trail of material from the outer envelope, leaving a tail 13 light-years in length, formed over tens of thousands of years. It is thought that a hot bow wave of compressed plasma/gas is the cause of the tail; the bow wave is a result of the interaction of the stellar wind from Mira A with gas in interstellar space, through which Mira is moving at an extremely high speed of . The tail consists of material stripped from the head of the bow wave, which is also visible in ultraviolet observations. Mira&#x27;s bow shock will eventually evolve into a planetary nebula, the form of which will be considerably affected by the motion through the interstellar medium (ISM). Mira’s tail offers a unique opportunity to study how stars like our sun die and ultimately seed new solar systems. As Mira hurls along, its tail drops off carbon, oxygen and other important elements needed for new stars, planets, and possibly even life to form. This tail material, visible now for the first time, has been shed over the past 30,000 years.

===Component B===
The companion star is away from the main star. It was resolved by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995, when it was 70 astronomical units from the primary; and results were announced in 1997. The HST ultraviolet images and later X-ray images by the Chandra space telescope show a spiral of gas rising off Mira in the direction of Mira B. The companion&#x27;s orbital period around Mira is approximately 400 years.

In 2007, observations showed a protoplanetary disc around the companion, Mira B. This disc is being accreted from material in the solar wind from Mira and could eventually form new planets. These observations also hinted that the companion was a main-sequence star of around 0.7 solar mass and spectral type K, instead of a white dwarf as originally thought. However, in 2010 further research indicated that Mira B is, in fact, a white dwarf.

<text>MV &quot;Virginian&quot; (T-AK 9205), formerly named the MV &quot;Strong Virginian&quot; (T-AKR-9205), is a combination container, heavy lift, and roll-on/roll-off ship. Owned and operated by Sealift Incorporated of Oyster Bay, New York, the ship is one of seventeen containerroll-on/roll-off ships in use by the Military Sealift Command, and one of 28 ships assigned to that organization&#x27;s Sealift Program Office. The ship was previously known as the MV &quot;Saint Magnus and theMV &quot;Jolly Indaco.

==Cargo equipment==
The ship had one large cargo hold with a tween deck that could be set at three different heights. It had a single 800-ton derrick for heavy-lift use. In addition it had a single traveling gantry crane fitted with dual portal cranes, both of which were rated at independently, and could be operated together for lifts up to . For roll-on/roll-off (roro) cargo, the ship had two trailer elevators and roro ramps.

==History==

Built as &quot;Saint Magnus&quot; at Bremer Vulkan, Bremen, Germany in 1984, &quot;Virginian&quot; spent her first years in the commercial shipping service. Ironically, the ship that would later be known for carrying military supplies to the Middle East was accidentally hit by an Exocet missile while off-loading commercial cargo in Iraq in 1986. In these early years, the ship was also renamed &quot;Jolly Indaco&quot;.


MSC first chartered the ship, then known as MV &quot;Strong Virginian&quot;, in 1992. For the next five years, a 500-bed fleet hospital was prepositioned aboard the ship as she carried out a variety of missions for the Department of Defense. Some of its jobs during this time included delivering equipment and supplies to Africa as part of Operation Restore Hope, transporting a bio-safety lab from Inchon, Korea, to Jakarta, Indonesia, and ferrying harbor tugs used by the U.S. Navy from Diego Garcia to Guam and back.

On March 14, 1997, the United States Department of Defense announced a new charter for the &quot;Strong Virginian&quot;. This contract, number N00033-97-C-3007, was a $23,592,099 time charter contract from the Military Sealift Command to operator Van Ommeren Shipping (USA), Inc., of Stamford, Connecticut. Under the contract, the &quot;Strong Virginian&quot; was to be used in the prepositioning of United States Army cargo in the Indian Ocean at the island of Diego Garcia. The contract included options which could have brought the cumulative value up to US$47,992,099 and was to expire by March 1999. This contract was competitively procured with 250 proposals solicited and four offers received.

Virginian was chartered again in 1998 and, for the next four years, the ship was used to support the U.S. Army. Virginian delivered combat craft, tugboats and barges and other elements of the Army&#x27;s port opening packages. These packages are used to give the military access to rarely used ports in areas vital to U.S. military operations. On September 30, 2002, the ship was released from MSC service and returned to its owner.

Sealift Incorporated bought the ship from Van Ommeren Shipping USA, Inc. taking delivery on June 10, 2003. At that point, Sealift renamed the ship the &quot;Virginian&quot;. Between November 2002 and May 2006, the &quot;Virginian&quot; completed 21 missions for the U.S. military, delivering almost , or nearly 30 football fields, of cargo.

On October 16, 2007, the United States Department of Defense announced that it awarded contract N00033-08-C-5500 to Sealift Incorporated. This was a $10,614,000 firm-fixed-price contract plus reimbursables for the &quot;Virginian&quot;. The ship was contracted to carry containers laden with ammunition to support the global war on terrorism and the United States Central Command. The contract includes options, which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $39,814,000. If options are exercised, work may continue through October 2011. This contract was competitively procured via Federal Business Opportunities and the Military Sealift Command websites, with more than 200 proposals solicited and three offers received. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s Military Sealift Command is the contracting authority.

The ship was sold for scrap in August 2012 in Singapore and was recycled in Bangladesh that same month.

<doc id="20883" wikidata="Q487338" url="?curid=20883" title="Mojito">
<text>Mojito (; ) is a traditional Cuban punch. The cocktail often consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and mint. Its combination of sweetness, citrus, and herbaceous mint flavors is intended to complement the rum, and has made the mojito a popular summer drink.

When preparing a mojito, fresh lime juice is added to sugar (or to simple syrup) and mint leaves. The mixture is then gently mashed with a muddler. The mint leaves should only be bruised to release the essential oils and should not be shredded. Then rum is added and the mixture is briefly stirred to dissolve the sugar and to lift the mint leaves up from the bottom for better presentation. Finally, the drink is topped with crushed ice and sparkling soda water. Mint sprigs or lime wedges are used to garnish the glass.

In Cuba, the mint used to make mojito is most commonly &quot;Mentha × villosa&quot; (called or in Cuba) which has a light minty-citrus aroma, but outside of Cuba spearmint, which has a stronger mint aroma, is often used.

==History==
Havana, Cuba, is the birthplace of the mojito, although its exact origin is a subject of debate. It was known that the native people had remedies for various tropical illnesses, so a small boarding party went ashore on Cuba and came back with ingredients for an effective medicine. The ingredients were &quot;aguardiente de caña&quot; (translated as &quot;burning water&quot;, a crude form of rum made from sugar cane) mixed with local tropical ingredients: lime, sugarcane juice, and mint. Lime juice on its own would have significantly prevented scurvy and dysentery, and tafia/rum was soon added as it became widely available to the British (ca. 1650). Mint, lime and sugar were also helpful in hiding the harsh taste of this spirit. Another theory is that it was invented by Sir Francis Drake. The &quot;El Draque&quot; cocktail was prepared with brandy. While this drink was not called a Mojito at this time, it was the original combination of these ingredients.

There are several theories behind the origin of the name &quot;Mojito&quot;: one such theory holds that name relates to mojo, a Cuban seasoning made from lime and used to flavor dishes. Another theory is that the name Mojito is simply a derivative of &quot;mojadito&quot; (Spanish for &quot;lightly wet&quot;), the diminutive of &quot;mojado&quot; (&quot;wet&quot;).

The mojito has routinely been presented as a favorite drink of author Ernest Hemingway. It has also often been said that Hemingway made the bar called La Bodeguita del Medio famous when he became one of its regulars and wrote &quot;My Mojito in La Bodeguita, My Daiquiri in El Floridita&quot; on a wall of the bar. This epigraph, handwritten and signed in his name, persists despite doubts expressed by Hemingway biographers about such patronage and the author&#x27;s taste for mojitos. La Bodeguita del Medio is better known for its food than its drink.

A survey by an international market research company found that in 2016 the mojito was the most popular cocktail in Britain and France.

==Variations==
It is said that some hotels in Havana use powdered sugar with the mint leaves rather than granulated sugar as the former dissolves more readily, while many establishments use simple syrup instead. The &quot;rose mojito&quot;, which is a mojito variation containing the rose-flavored spirit, Lanique, was first created at the Albert&#x27;s Schloss bar in Manchester, England. A mojito without alcohol is called a &quot;virgin mojito&quot; or &quot;nojito&quot;. The Cojito adds coconut flavor, often through the use of coconut-flavored rum. A dirty mojito calls for gold rum instead of white rum, and raw sugar or demerara sugar. Demerara is a light brown, partially refined, sugar produced from the first crystallization during processing cane juice into sugar crystals. Adding this to a mojito gives it a caramel-like flavor. A dark rum mojito simply calls for a dark rum to be used instead of white.

In Mexico, tequila brand Don Julio offers the &quot;mojito blanco&quot; by simply replacing rum with tequila.

In Peru, there are mojito variations that are made by adding fruits like grapefruit, called &quot;mojito de toronja&quot;, or with passionfruit, called &quot;mojito de maracuyá&quot;. Many restaurants serve them, and these added ingredients enhance the cocktail and its original flavor. Some other fruits are found in other mojito recipes: pears, raspberries, and oranges. Purees of such fruits may also be used instead of the whole fruit itself. The strawberry mojito includes muddled strawberries; a further departure along these lines substitutes gin for the light rum and lemon juice for lime juice, and adds tonic.

<text>Mohammad Zahir Shah (15 October 1914 – 23 July 2007) was the last King of Afghanistan, reigning from 8 November 1933 until he was deposed on 17 July 1973. Ruling for 40 years, Zahir Shah was the longest-serving ruler of Afghanistan since the foundation of the Durrani Empire in the 18th century.

He expanded Afghanistan&#x27;s diplomatic relations with many countries, including with both sides of the Cold War. In the 1950s, Zahir Shah began modernizing the country, culminating in the creation of a new constitution and a constitutional monarchy system. Demonstrating nonpartisanism, his long reign was marked by peace in the country which was lost afterwards with the onset of the Afghan conflict.

In 1973, while Zahir Shah was undergoing medical treatment in Italy, his regime was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état by his cousin and former prime minister, Mohammad Daoud Khan, who established a single-party republic, ending more than 225 years of continuous monarchical government. He remained in exile near Rome until 2002, returning to Afghanistan after the end of the Taliban government. He was given the title Father of the Nation, which he held until his death in 2007.

==Early life==
Zahir Shah was born on 15 October 1914, in a city quarter called Deh Afghanan in Kabul, Afghanistan into a Barakzai Pashtun family. He was the son of Mohammad Nadir Shah (1883–1933) and Mah Parwar Begum (d. 1941). Nadir was a senior member of the Mohammadzai Royal family and Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Afghan Army under King Amanullah Khan.

Zahir Shah was educated in a special class for princes at Elementary Primary, built in 1904 by the United Kingdom, and Habibia High School, where many subjects were taught in English. For his secondary education, he went to the Amaniya High School (built during the reign of King Amanullah by France, where many subjects were taught in French. This school was renamed by Nadir Shah as Esteqlal High School) after the fall of King Amanullah. Zahir Shah studied at the Infanterie Military School in the winter (school year in Kabul, 21 March to November). He was then sent to France for further training. He continued his education in France where his father had served as a diplomatic envoy, studying at the Pasteur Institute and the University of Montpellier. When he returned to Afghanistan he helped his father and uncles restore order and reassert government control during a period of lawlessness in the country. He was later enrolled at an Infantry School and appointed a privy counsellor. Zahir Shah served in the government positions of deputy war minister and minister of education.

===Ancestry===
Zahir&#x27;s father, Mohammad Nadir Shah, was the son of Sardar Mohammad Yusuf Khan. Born in Dehradun, British India, Nadir&#x27;s family had been exiled after the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Nadir Shah was a descendant of Sardar Sultan Mohammad Khan Telai, half-brother of Emir Dost Mohammad Khan. His grandfather Mohammad Yahya Khan (father in law of Emir Yaqub Khan) was in charge of the negotiations with the British resulting in the Treaty of Gandamak. After the British invasion after the killing of Sir Louis Cavagnari during 1879, Yaqub Khan, Yahya Khan and his sons Princes Mohammad Yusuf Khan and Mohammad Asef Khan were taken captive by the British and transferred to the British Raj, where they remained forcibly until the two princes were invited back to Afghanistan by Emir Abdur Rahman Khan during the last year of his reign (1901). During the reign of Amir Habibullah they received the title of Companions of the King (Musahiban). Nadir assumed the throne after the execution of the self-proclaimed ruler of Afghanistan Habibullah Kalakani on 1 November 1929.

==Reign==

Zahir Khan was proclaimed king (shah) on 8 November 1933 at the age of 19, after the assassination of his father Mohammad Nadir Shah. After his ascension to the throne he was given the regnal title, &quot;He who puts his trust in God, follower of the firm religion of Islam&quot;. For the first 20 years, he did not effectively rule, instead ceding power to his paternal uncles, Mohammad Hashim Khan and Shah Mahmud Khan, who both served as Prime Ministers. This period fostered a growth in Afghanistan&#x27;s relations with the international community as during 1934, Afghanistan joined the League of Nations while also receiving formal recognition from the United States. By the end of the 1930s, agreements on foreign assistance and trade had been reached with many countries, most notably with the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan.

Zahir Shah provided aid, weapons, and Afghan fighters to the Uighur and Kirghiz Muslim rebels who had established the First East Turkestan Republic. The aid was not capable of saving the First East Turkestan Republic, as the Afghan, Uighur, and Kirghiz forces were defeated in 1934 by the Kuomintang Chinese Muslim New 36th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, commanded by General Ma Zhancang at the Battle of Kashgar and Battle of Yarkand. All the Afghan volunteers were killed by the Chinese Muslim troops, who then abolished the First East Turkestan Republic, and reestablished Chinese government control over the area.Despite close relations to the Axis powers, Zahir Shah and his governments refused to take sides during World War II and Afghanistan remained one of the few countries in the world to remain neutral. From 1944 to 1947, Afghanistan experienced a series of revolts by various tribes. After the end of World War II, Zahir Shah recognised the need for the modernisation of Afghanistan and recruited a number of foreign advisers to assist with the process. During this period Afghanistan&#x27;s first modern university was founded.&lt;ref name=&quot;10/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign a number of potential advances and reforms were derailed as a result of factionalism and political infighting. He also requested financial aid from both the United States and the Soviet Union, and Afghanistan was one of few countries in the world to receive aid from both Cold War adversaries. In a 1969 interview, Zahir Shah said that he is &quot;not a capitalist. But I also don&#x27;t want socialism. I don&#x27;t want socialism that would bring about the kind of situation [that exists] in Czechoslovakia. I don&#x27;t want us to become the servants of Russia or China or the servant of any other place.&quot;

He was considered a relatively lenient leader compared to previous kings; Zahir Shah had never signed a warrant for the execution of anyone for political reasons during his reign. He also used his power several times to commute capital punishment sentences given to some convicted criminals. At Zahir Shah&#x27;s behest the new 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan was introduced which made Afghanistan a modern democratic state by introducing free elections, a parliament, civil and political rights, women&#x27;s rights, and universal suffrage.

At least five Afghani Pul coins during his reign bore the Arabic title:
المتوكل على الله محمد ظاهر شاه, &quot;AlMutawakkil &#x27;ala Allah Muhammad Zhahir Shah&quot; which means &quot;The leaner on God, Muhammad Zhahir Shah&quot;. The title &quot;AlMutawakkil &#x27;ala Allah&quot;, &quot;The leaner on God&quot; is taken from Quran 8:61.

By the time he returned to Afghanistan in 2002, Zahir Shah&#x27;s rule was characterized as a lengthy era of peace.

==Exile==

In 1973, while Zahir Shah was abroad in Italy, his cousin Mohammad Daoud Khan staged a coup d&#x27;état and established an autocratic republican government. As a former Prime Minister, Daoud Khan had been forced to resign by Zahir Shah a decade earlier and felt that Zahir Shah lacked leadership and that the parliamentary system prevented real progressivism. In August 1973, Zahir Shah sent a letter from Rome to Khan in Kabul declaring his abdication, saying he respected &quot;the will of my compatriots&quot; after realizing the people of Afghanistan &quot;with absolute majority welcomed a Republican regime&quot;.

Zahir Shah lived in exile in Italy for 29 years alongside his wife Queen Humaira Begum and other royal family members. Initially, they lived in a three‐room apartment on Rome&#x27;s Via Cassia. Relatives of the 1920s King Amanullah Khan, of the same house of Barakzai, also lived in Rome. President Daoud Khan continued to send money to them in Italy consisting of income from property and estates of the former royal family. After the Saur Revolution, the leftist Khalq government cut all funds to Italy.

Zahir Shah eventually lived in a villa in the affluent community of Olgiata on Via Cassia, north of Rome, where he spent his time playing golf and chess, as well as tending to his garden. He was financially supported by the Shah of Iran since the new Afghan government failed to provide him a monthly salary. The Shah also supported his two sons who were studying in the United States and Canada. He was prohibited from returning to Afghanistan during the late 1970s by the Soviet-assisted Communist government. In 1983 during the Soviet–Afghan War, Zahir Shah was cautiously involved with plans to develop a government in exile. Ultimately these plans failed because he could not reach a consensus with powerful Islamist factions. It has also been reported that Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, and India had all tried to persuade Zahir Shah to return as chief of a neutral, possibly interim, administration in Kabul. Both the Soviet Union and the United States sent representatives to meet him, and President Mohammad Najibullah supported Zahir Shah to play a role in a possible interim government in the quest for peace. In May 1990, Zahir Shah issued a long statement through Voice of America and the BBC calling for unity and peace among Afghans, and offering his services. This reportedly led to a spark of interest and approval among the Kabul populace. However, the idea of a revived political role for Zahir Shah was met with hostility by some, notably radical Islamist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.

In 1991, Zahir Shah survived an attempt on his life by a knife-wielding assassin masquerading as a Portuguese journalist who later revealed that the attempted assassination was ordered by Osama bin Laden. The assassin stated “Now I must kill you”, before stabbing Zahir Shah in his breast-pocket, the former king’s life being saved by a tin of Café Crème cigarillos. The assassin then stabbed Zahir Shah in the neck several times, before being overpowered by former General Abdul Wali. Zahir Shah was rushed to hospital and later recovered, with the assassin being sentenced to 10 years in a high-security prison in Rebibbia. After the fall of the pro-Soviet government, Zahir Shah was favored by many to return and restore the monarchy to unify the country as he was acceptable to most factions. However, these efforts were blocked mostly by Pakistan&#x27;s ISI, who feared his stance on the Durand Line issue. In June 1995, Zahir Shah&#x27;s former envoy Sardar Wali announced at talks in Islamabad, Pakistan, that Zahir Shah was willing to participate in peace talks to end the Afghan Civil War, but no consensus was ever reached.

==Return to Afghanistan==

On 18 April 2002, at the age of 87 and four months after the end of Taliban rule, Zahir Shah returned to Afghanistan, flown in on an Italian military plane, and welcomed at Kabul&#x27;s airport by Hamid Karzai and other officials. His return was widely welcomed by Afghans, and he was liked by all ethnic groups. There were proposals for a return to the monarchy – Zahir Shah himself let it be known that he would accept whatever responsibility was given him by the Loya Jirga, which he initiated in June 2002. However he was obliged to publicly renounce monarchical leadership at the behest of the United States. As Pakistan would not accept Zahir as king due to fears regarding his stance on the Durand Line issue; the American government knew allowing him to be restored could result in Pakistan feeling threatened to the point they may cease cooperating with the international coalition and potentially even resume their support for the Taliban. At the time, most delegates to the Loya Jirga were prepared to vote for Zahir Shah and block the U.S.-backed leader of the Northern Alliance, Hamid Karzai. While he was prepared to become chief of state Zahir made it known that it would not necessarily be as monarch: &quot;I will accept the responsibility of head of state if that is what the Loya Jirga demands of me, but I have no intention to restore the monarchy. I do not care about the title of king. The people call me Baba and I prefer this title.&quot; Karzai called Zahir Shah a &quot;symbol of unity, a very kind man&quot; and a &quot;fatherly figure.&quot;

Zahir Shah visited his father&#x27;s tomb soon after arriving in Kabul and reportedly gasped after witnessing rocket holes and gunfire damage on the tomb caused by the civil war.

Hamid Karzai, who was favored by Zahir Shah, became president of Afghanistan after the Loya Jirga. Karzai, from the Pashtun Popalzai clan, provided Zahir Shah&#x27;s relatives with major jobs in the transitional government. Following the Loya Jirga he was given the title &quot;Father of the Nation&quot; by Karzai, symbolizing his role in Afghanistan&#x27;s history as a symbol of national unity. This title ended with his death. In August 2002 he relocated back to the Arg, his old palace, after 29 years.

In an October 2002 visit to France, Zahir Shah slipped in a bathroom, bruising his ribs, and on 21 June 2003, while in France for a medical check-up, he broke his femur.

On 3 February 2004, Zahir Shah was flown from Kabul to New Delhi, India, for medical treatment after complaining of an intestinal problem. He was hospitalized for two weeks and remained in New Delhi under observation. On 18 May 2004, he was brought to a hospital in the United Arab Emirates because of nose bleeding caused by heat.

Zahir Shah attended the 7 December 2004 swearing-in of Hamid Karzai as President of Afghanistan. During his final years, he was frail and required a microphone pinned to his collar so that his faint voice could be heard. In January 2007, Zahir was reported to be seriously ill and bedridden.

== Death ==

On 23 July 2007, Zahir Shah died in the compound of the presidential palace in Kabul at the age of 92 after a long illness – 74 years after he ascended the throne and 34 years after his abdication. His death was announced on national television by President Karzai, who said &quot;He was the servant of his people, the friend of his people, he was a very kind person, kind hearted. He believed in the rule of the people and in human rights.&quot; His funeral was held on 24 July. It began on the premises of the presidential palace, where politicians and dignitaries paid their respects; his coffin was then taken to a mosque before being moved to the royal mausoleum on Maranjan Hill in eastern Kabul.

==Personal life==
Zahir Shah was reportedly shy, modest and &quot;soft-spoken&quot;. He liked photography, chess, and smoking cigars.

Zahir Shah was fluent in Pashto, Dari (his mother tongue), and could also speak English and perfect French.

To Afghan people, he was known as &quot;Baba&quot;.

===Family===

He married his first cousin Humaira Begum (1918–2002) on 7 November 1931 in Kabul. They had six sons and two daughters:
In January 2009, an article by Ahmad Majidyar of the American Enterprise Institute included one of his grandsons, Mustafa Zahir, on a list of fifteen possible candidates in the 2009 Afghan presidential election. However, Mustafa did not become a candidate. His granddaughter, Princess Noal of Afghanistan, is the wife of Muhammad Ali, Prince of the Sa&#x27;id, the heir apparent to the abolished thrones of Egypt and Sudan.

<doc id="20889" wikidata="Q235169" url="?curid=20889" title="Miso">
<text>is a traditional Japanese seasoning. It is a thick paste produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and kōji (the fungus &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;), and sometimes rice, barley, seaweed, or other ingredients. It is used for sauces and spreads; pickling vegetables, fish, or meats; and mixing with dashi soup stock to serve as miso soup, a Japanese culinary staple food. Miso is high in protein and rich in vitamins and minerals, and it played an important nutritional role in feudal Japan. Miso is widely used in both traditional and modern cooking in Japan, and as of 2018 had been gaining worldwide interest.

Typically, miso is salty, but its flavor and aroma depend on the ingredients and fermentation process. Different varieties of miso have been variously described as salty, sweet, earthy, fruity, or savory.

==History==

The origin of miso of Japan is not completely clear. 
*Grain and fish misos had been manufactured in Japan since the Neolithic era (Jōmon period, 14,000–300 BC). These are called and are similar to the early fish- and soy-based sauces produced throughout East Asia.
*This miso predecessor originated in China during the third century BC. and other fermented soy-based foods likely were introduced to Japan at the same time as Buddhism in the sixth century AD. This fermented food was called &quot;shi&quot; (). The beginning of the current origin of miso is or () in the Nara period (710–794); with still meaning beans. It is believed that the word changed to &quot;Misho&quot; and then &quot;Miso&quot;.

In the Kamakura period (1185–1333), a common meal was made up of a bowl of rice, some dried fish, a serving of miso, and a fresh vegetable. Until the Muromachi period (1337 to 1573), miso was made without grinding the soybeans, somewhat like . In the Muromachi era, Buddhist monks discovered that soybeans could be ground into a paste, spawning new methods using miso to flavor other foods. In medieval times, the word , meaning homemade miso, appeared. Miso production is relatively simple, so homemade versions spread throughout Japan. Miso was used as military provisions during the Sengoku period, and making miso was an important economic activity for of that era.

During the Edo period (1603–1868), miso was also called () and () and various types of miso that fit with each local climate and culture emerged throughout Japan.

Today, miso is produced industrially in large quantities, and traditional homemade miso has become a rarity. In recent years, many new types of miso have appeared, including ones with added soup stocks or calcium, made with beans other than soy, or having reduced salt for health, among other varieties available.

==Ingredients==

The ingredients used to produce miso may include any mix of soybeans, barley, rice, buckwheat, millet, rye, wheat, hemp seed, and cycad, among others. Lately, producers in other countries have also begun selling miso made from chickpeas, corn, azuki beans, amaranth, and quinoa. Fermentation time ranges from as little as five days to several years. The variety of Japanese miso is difficult to classify but is commonly done by grain type, color, taste, and background.
* : barley
* : whole wheat/barley
* : brown rice
* : chunky, healthy ( is unblended)
* : mixed with hot chili pepper for dipping sauce
* : hemp seed
* : buckwheat
* : Highland barley
* : made from cycad pulp, Buddhist temple diet
* : &quot;five-grain&quot;: soy, wheat, barley, proso millet, and foxtail millet

Many regions have their own specific variation on the miso standard. For example, the soybeans used in Sendai miso are much more coarsely mashed than in normal soy miso.

Miso made with rice such as miso () and miso () are called miso ().

==Types and flavor==

Miso&#x27;s taste, aroma, texture, and appearance vary by region and season. Other important variables that contribute to a particular miso&#x27;s flavor include temperature, fermentation duration, salt content, variety of , and fermenting vessel. The most common flavor categories of miso are:

* , &quot;white miso&quot;
* , &quot;red miso&quot;
* , &quot;mixed miso&quot;

Although white and red ( and ) are the most common misos available, different varieties may be preferred in particular regions of Japan. In the eastern Kantō region that includes Tokyo, the darker brownish is popular while in the western Kansai region encompassing Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe, the lighter is preferred.
A more nuanced breakdown of the flavors is as follows:

* miso () or &quot;rice miso&quot; can be yellow, yellowish white, red, etc. Whitish miso is made from boiled soybeans, and reddish miso is made from steamed soybeans. miso is consumed more in eastern Japan and the Hokuriku and Kinki areas.
* miso () or &quot;barley miso&quot; is a whitish miso produced in Kyushu, western Chugoku, and Shikoku areas. Another reddish miso is produced in the northern Kanto area. miso has a peculiar smell.
* miso () or &quot;soybean miso&quot; is a darker, more reddish brown than miso. This is not as sweet as some other varieties, but it has some astringency and good () flavor. This miso requires a long maturing term. miso is consumed mostly in Aichi prefecture, Gifu prefecture, and Mie prefecture. Soybean (grain-free) miso is also labeled (). is an Okazaki, Aichi specialty and has its origins in Mikawa Province during the Sengoku period. The processing method with large wooden barrels and stones on the lid remains unchanged.
* () or () miso, or &quot;mixed miso&quot;, comes in many types because it is a mixture or compound of other varieties of miso. This may improve the weak points of each type of miso. For example, miso is very salty, but when combined with miso, the finished product has a mild taste.
* () or red miso is aged, sometimes for more than one year. As a result, due to the Maillard reaction, the color changes gradually from white to red or black, thus giving it the name red miso. Characteristics of the flavor are saltiness and some astringency with umami. It is often a much stronger-tasting miso. Factors in the depth of color are the formula of the soybeans and the quantity used. Generally, steamed soybeans are more deeply colored than boiled soybeans.
* () or white miso is the most widely produced miso, made in many regions of the country. Its main ingredients are rice, barley, and a small quantity of soybeans. If more soybeans were added, the miso would be red or brown. Compared with red miso, white miso has a very short fermentation time. The taste is sweet, and the umami is soft or light (compared to red miso).

=== Chemical properties of flavor and aroma compounds ===

The distinct and unique aroma of miso determines its quality. Many reactions occur among the components of miso, primarily the Maillard reaction, a non-enzymatic reaction of an amino group with a reducing sugar. The volatile compounds produced from this reaction give miso its characteristic flavor and aroma. Depending on the microorganism in combination with the variety of soybean or cereal used, many flavor compounds are produced that give rise to the different types of miso. Fermentation products such as furanone compounds, including 4-hydroxy-2(or 5)-ethyl-5(or 2)-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (HEMF) and 4-hydroxy-2,5 dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (HDMF) are novel flavor compounds of miso. HEMF is especially known for its sweet aroma and is very important for the sensory evaluation of the aroma of rice miso.

The unique sensory properties of miso are complex. The key factor in the final product&#x27;s overall quality is the microorganisms&#x27; enzymatic activity. They use the composition of miso (rice, barley, and soybeans) to produce different pigments, flavors, and aroma compounds.

Proteolysis of soybean protein produces constituent amino acids that impart an umami taste that enhances the relatively dull taste of soybean by itself. Soy protein contains a substantial amount of glutamate, the salt of which is known as MSG or monosodium glutamate, a popular ingredient used by food manufacturers to improve the taste of their products. The umami effect of MSG itself is one-dimensional. The umami taste of miso is multidimensional because of the myriad amino acids and fermentation products.

Barley miso is a traditional farmhouse variety made for personal use. Often called &quot;rural miso&quot;, domestic barley is used more than imported barley. Containing glutamic acid and aromatic compounds such as ferulic acid and vanillic acid, barley miso is distinguished by a characteristic flavor.

== Fermentation ==

Miso&#x27;s unique properties and flavor profile can be attributed to the compounds produced through the fermentation process. Miso, depending on the variety, consists of a starter culture called (), soybeans, and usually a grain (either rice, barley, or rye). The miso goes through a two-step process; first creating the , and second the is combined with the other components, and the mixture is left to be enzymatically digested, fermented and aged.

=== Creating koji ===

Koji is produced by introducing the mold &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot; onto steamed white rice. This mold culture comes from dried &quot;A. oryzae&quot; spores called (, ) or &quot;starter koji&quot; and is isolated from plant matter (usually rice) and cultivated. In the past, the natural presence of &quot;A. oryzae&quot; spores was relied upon to create koji, but because of the difficulty of producing the culture, is added almost exclusively in both industrial and traditional production of miso. is produced much in the same way as koji, but also has a small portion of wood ash added to the mixture which gives important nutrients to the fungus as well as promoting sporulation.

&quot;A. oryzae&quot; is an aerobic fungus and is the most active fermenting agent in koji as it produces amylolytic, and proteolytic enzymes which are essential to creating the final miso product. Amylolytic enzymes such as amylase aid in the breakdown of starch in the grains to sugar and dextrin, while proteolytic enzymes such as protease catalyze the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids. These both aid in the enzymatic digestion of rice and soybeans. Depending on the strain of &quot;A. oryzae&quot;, the enzymatic composition varies, thereby changing the characteristics of the final miso product. For example, the strain used to create the sweeter white miso would likely produce a higher content of amylolytic enzymes, while comparatively, soybean miso might have a higher content of proteolytic enzymes.

To create optimal conditions for enzymatic production and the growth of &quot;A. oryzae&quot;, the koji&#x27;s environment must be carefully regulated. Temperature, humidity, and oxygen content are all important factors in maximizing mold growth and enzyme production and preventing other harmful bacteria from producing. Once the koji has reached a desirable flavor profile, it is usually mixed with salt to prevent further fermentation.

Although other strains of fungi have been used to produce koji, &quot;A. oryzae&quot; is the most desirable because of several properties, including the fact that it does not produce aflatoxin.

==Storage and preparation==

Miso typically comes as a paste in a sealed container requiring refrigeration after opening. Natural miso is a living food containing many beneficial microorganisms such as &quot;Tetragenococcus halophilus&quot;, which can be killed by overcooking. For this reason, the miso should be added to soups or other foods prepared just before they are removed from the heat. Using miso without any cooking may be even better.

==Usage==

Miso is a part of many Japanese-style meals. It most commonly appears as the main ingredient of miso soup, which is eaten daily by much of the Japanese population. The pairing of plain rice and miso soup is a fundamental unit of Japanese cuisine. This pairing is the basis of a traditional Japanese breakfast.

Miso is used in many other types of soup and soup-like dishes, including some kinds of ramen, udon, , and . Generally, such dishes have the title miso prefixed to their name (for example, ) and have a heavier, earthier flavor and aroma than other Japanese soups that are not miso-based.

Many traditional confections use a sweet, thick miso glaze, such as and . Miso-glazed treats are strongly associated with Japanese festivals, although they are available year-round at supermarkets. The consistency of miso glaze ranges from thick and taffy-like to thin and drippy.

Soybean miso is used to make a type of pickle called . These pickles are typically made from cucumber, daikon, napa cabbage, or eggplant, and are sweeter and less salty than the standard Japanese salt pickle.

Other foods with miso as an ingredient include:
* (miso sweetened with molasses used for grilling)
* (charcoal-grilled mochi covered in miso)
* miso-braised vegetables or mushrooms
* marinades: fish or chicken can be mixed with miso and rice wine overnight to be grilled
* corn on the cob in Japan is often coated with , wrapped in foil and grilled
* sauces: sauces like (a variant on teriyaki) 
* dips: used as a dip to eat with vegetables (e.g., cucumbers, daikon, carrots, etc.)
* side dish: miso is often eaten as a condiment and a side dish. Mixed or cooked miso with spices or vegetables is called (), often eaten along with hot rice or spread over 

==Nutrition and health==
Claims that miso is high in vitamin B12 have been contradicted in some studies.

Some experts suggest that miso is a source of &quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot;. Miso is relatively high in salt which could contribute to increased blood pressure in the small percentage of the population with sodium-sensitive prehypertension or hypertension. Several studies using salt-sensitive hypertensive models and analyzing long-term intake have suggested that miso lessens salt&#x27;s effects on blood pressure.

<text>Máel Coluim mac Domnaill (anglicised Malcolm I; 5 October 897 – 954) was king of Alba (before 943–954), becoming king when his cousin Constantine II abdicated to become a monk. He was the son of Donald II.

== Biography ==
Malcolm was born in 897, the son of Donald II, who had reigned from 889 until 900. By the 940s, he was no longer a young man, and may have become impatient in awaiting the throne. Willingly or not—the 11th century &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot;, a verse history in the form of a supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision that Constantine II abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Máel Coluim.

Seven years later, the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; says:

[Malcolm I] plundered the English as far as the River Tees, and he seized a multitude of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week&#x27;s time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.

Máel Coluim was the third in his immediate family to die violently, his father Donald II and grandfather Constantine I both having met similar fates 54 years earlier in 900 and 77 years earlier in 877, respectively.

In 945, Edmund I of England, having expelled Amlaíb Cuarán (Olaf Sihtricsson) from Northumbria, devastated Cumbria and blinded two sons of Domnall mac Eógain, king of Strathclyde. It is said that he then &quot;let&quot; or &quot;commended&quot; Strathclyde to Máel Coluim in return for an alliance. What is to be understood by &quot;let&quot; or &quot;commended&quot; is unclear, but it may well mean that Máel Coluim had been the overlord of Strathclyde and that Edmund recognised this while taking lands in southern Cumbria for himself.

The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; says that Máel Coluim took an army into Moray &quot;and slew Cellach&quot;. Cellach is not named in the surviving genealogies of the rulers of Moray, and his identity is unknown.

Máel Coluim appears to have kept his agreement with the late English king, which may have been renewed with the new king, Edmund having been murdered in 946 and succeeded by his brother Eadred. Eric Haraldsson took York in 948, before being driven out by Eadred, and when Amlaíb Cuarán again took York in 949–950, Máel Coluim raided Northumbria as far south as the Tees taking &quot;a multitude of people and many herds of cattle&quot; according to the Chronicle. The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; for 952 report a battle between &quot;the men of Alba and the Britons [of Strathclyde] and the English&quot; against the foreigners, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the Northmen or the Norse–Gaels. This battle is not reported by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, and it is unclear whether it should be related to the expulsion of Amlaíb Cuarán from York or the return of Eric.

The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; report that Máel Coluim was killed in 954. Other sources place this most probably in the Mearns, either at Fetteresso following the Chronicle, or at Dunnottar following &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot;. He was buried on Iona. Some versions of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, and the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot;, are read as placing Máel Coluim&#x27;s death at Blervie, near Forres.

== Issue ==
The name of Máel Coluim&#x27;s wife is not known; however, it is known he had 2 sons:
* Dub, King of Scotland, also known as Dub mac Maíl Coluim and Duff, King of Alba 962–967;
* Kenneth II of Scotland, also known as Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, King of Alba 971–995.

<doc id="20892" wikidata="Q68508" url="?curid=20892" title="Malcolm III of Scotland">
<text>Malcolm III (; ; –13 November 1093) was King of Alba from 1058 to 1093. He was later nicknamed &quot;Canmore&quot; (, &quot;, understood as &quot;great chief&quot;). Malcolm&#x27;s long reign of 35 years preceded the beginning of the Scoto-Norman age. Henry I of England and Eustace III, Count of Boulogne were his sons-in-law, making him the maternal grandfather of Empress Matilda, William Adelin and Matilda I, Countess of Boulogne. All three of them were prominent in English politics during the 12th century.

Malcolm&#x27;s kingdom did not extend over the full territory of modern Scotland: many of the islands and the land north of the River Oykel were Scandinavian, and south of the Firth of Forth there were numerous independent or semi-independent realms, including the kingdom of Strathclyde and Bamburgh, and it is not certain what if any power the Scots exerted there on Malcolm&#x27;s accession. Throughout his reign Malcolm III led at least five invasions into English territory. One of Malcolm&#x27;s primary achievements was to secure the position of the lineage that ruled Scotland until the late thirteenth century, although his role as founder of a dynasty has more to do with the propaganda of his descendants than with history. He appears as a major character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, while his second wife, Margaret, was canonised as a saint in the thirteenth century.

== Background ==

Malcolm&#x27;s father Duncan I became king in late 1034, on the death of Malcolm II, Duncan&#x27;s maternal grandfather and Malcolm&#x27;s great-grandfather. One Scottish king-list gives Malcolm&#x27;s mother the name Suthen (Suthain), a Gaelic name; John of Fordun states that Malcolm&#x27;s mother was a &quot;blood relative&quot; (&quot;consanguinea&quot;) of the Danish earl Siward, though this may be a late attempt to deepen the Scottish royal family&#x27;s links to the earldom of Northampton (of which Siward was regarded as founder). Later tradition, attested by the fifteenth century, makes Malcolm&#x27;s mother the daughter of the miller of Forteviot and presents Malcolm as a bastard.

Duncan&#x27;s reign ended violently, he was killed in battle in Moray on 15 August 1040, by a force under the command of Macbeth. Duncan may have been young at the time of his death, and Malcolm and his brother Donald were probably children. Malcolm&#x27;s paternal grandfather was killed in battle in 1045, possibly as part of some continuing conflict with Macbeth.

According to later tradition, Duncan&#x27;s two young sons were sent away for greater safety — exactly where is the subject of debate. According to one version, Malcolm&#x27;s brother Donald was sent to the Isles; and Malcolm was sent to England; based on Fordun&#x27;s account, it came to be assumed that Malcolm passed most of Macbeth&#x27;s seventeen-year reign in the Kingdom of England at the court of Edward the Confessor. It is also possible that Malcolm went into exile at the court of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney, an enemy of Macbeth&#x27;s family. Ireland and Strathclyde may be other candidates, but neither the place of exile nor in fact exile itself, are certainties.

An English invasion in 1054, with Siward, Earl of Northumbria in command, had as its goal the installation of one &quot;Máel Coluim, son of the king of the Cumbrians&quot;. This Máel Coluim was traditionally identified with the later Malcolm III. The interpretation derives from the &quot;Chronicle&quot; attributed to John of Fordun, as well as from earlier sources such as William of Malmesbury. The latter reported that Macbeth was killed in the battle by Siward, but it is known that Macbeth outlived Siward by two years. A.A.M. Duncan argued in 2002 that, using the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; entry as their source, later writers innocently misidentified &quot;Máel Coluim&quot; with the later Scottish king of the same name. Duncan&#x27;s argument has been supported by several subsequent historians specialising in the era, such as Richard Oram, Dauvit Broun and Alex Woolf. It has also been suggested that Máel Coluim may have been a son of Owain Foel, British king of Strathclyde perhaps by a daughter of Malcolm II, King of Scotland.

In 1057, various chroniclers report the death of Macbeth at Malcolm&#x27;s hand, on 15 August 1057 at Lumphanan in Aberdeenshire. Macbeth was succeeded by his stepson Lulach, who was crowned at Scone, probably on 8 September 1057. Lulach was killed by Malcolm, &quot;by treachery&quot;, near Huntly on 23 April 1058. After this, Malcolm became king, perhaps inaugurated on 25 April 1058, although only John of Fordun reports this.

== Early reign ==
If Orderic Vitalis is to be relied upon, in the time of Edward the Confessor Malcolm was betrothed to the English king&#x27;s kinswoman Margaret, and it is possible this happened when he visited England in 1059. If a marriage agreement was made in 1059, it did not stop the Scots plundering Lindisfarne in 1061. It was common practice in medieval Gaelic-speaking societies for kings to launch an invasion, the so-called &quot;crech ríg&quot;, of a neighbour soon after taking power, and the Lindisfarne raid may have been used to boost the stability of the new regime. Since the invasion affected directly only the territory of the rulers of Bamburgh, it is unlikely to have particularly bothered either King Edward or the ealdorman of Northumbria in York, Tostig Godwinson, who at that time on pilgrimage to Rome and who did not enjoy a good relationship with the Bamburgh family. Malcolm may have had specific political motives. For instance, it has been suggested that he may have been trying to advance the position of Gospatric, his possible cousin, at the expense of the ruling Eadwulfing family. It has also been suggested that the raid may have been part of a dispute about the status of Strathclyde.

A tradition in the thirteenth-century &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; related that Malcolm married the widow of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Ingibiorg, a daughter of Finn Arnesson. Ingibiorg may have died prior to Malcolm&#x27;s marriage with Margaret. Malcolm may also have discarded Ingibiorg when the opportunity to marry a higher status lady arose in 1068. The &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; also claims that Duncan (Donnchad mac Maíl Coluim), later king, was a product of this union. Some Medieval commentators, following William of Malmesbury, claimed that Duncan was illegitimate, but this claim is propaganda reflecting the need of Malcolm&#x27;s descendants by Margaret to undermine the claims of Duncan&#x27;s descendants, the MacWilliams. Similarly, however, the importance of the MacWilliams to the earls of Orkney around 1200 would have provided an incentive to strengthen the historical ties between the two families, and thus Ingibiorg&#x27;s marriage to Malcolm may have been created to fabricate common descent.

The obituary of a certain Domnall, another son of Malcolm, is reported in 1085; since Domnall has no recorded mother, he may also have been born to Ingibiorg or else to some other unrecorded woman. If historical, Malcolm&#x27;s marriage to Ingibiorg would have helped create a favourable political position in the north and west. The &quot;Heimskringla&quot; tells that her father Finn had been an adviser to Harald Hardrada, king of Norway, and, after falling out with Harald, was then made an Earl by Sweyn Estridsson, king of Denmark, which may have been another recommendation for the match. Malcolm appears to have enjoyed a peaceful relationship with the Earldom of Orkney, ruled jointly by his possible stepsons, Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson. The &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; reports strife with Norway but this may be misplaced as it associates this with Magnus Barefoot, who became king of Norway only in 1093, the year of Malcolm&#x27;s death.

Malcolm gave sanctuary to Tostig Godwinson when the Northumbrians drove him out in 1065 and appears to have offered indirect support to the ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardrada and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and death at the battle of Stamford Bridge. In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from William of Normandy, among them Agatha, widow of Edward the Confessor&#x27;s nephew Edward the Exile, and her children: Edgar Ætheling and his sisters Margaret and Cristina. They were accompanied by Gospatric, by this time earl of Bamburgh. The exiles were disappointed, however, if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.

== Marriage to Margaret ==
In 1069, the exiles returned to England, to join a spreading revolt in the north. Even though Gospatric and Siward&#x27;s son Waltheof submitted by the end of the year, the arrival of a Danish army under Sweyn Estridsson seemed to ensure that William&#x27;s position remained weak. Malcolm decided on war and took his army south into Cumbria and across the Pennines, wasting Teesdale and Cleveland then marching north, loaded with loot, to Wearmouth, now part of the City of Sunderland. There Malcolm met Edgar and his family, who were invited to return with him but did not. As Sweyn had by now been bought off with a large Danegeld, Malcolm took his army home. Against the backdrop of William&#x27;s scorched earth policy against the northern English rebels, William sent Gospatric to raid Scotland through Cumbria as a further act of reprisal. In return, the Scots fleet raided the Northumbrian coast where Gospatric&#x27;s possessions were concentrated. Late in the year, perhaps shipwrecked on their way to a European exile, Edgar and his family again arrived in Scotland, this time to remain. By the end of 1070, Malcolm had married Edgar&#x27;s sister Margaret (later known as Saint Margaret).

The naming of their children represented a break with the traditional Scots regal names such as Malcolm, Cináed and Áed. The point of naming Margaret&#x27;s sons — Edward after her father Edward the Exile, Edmund for her grandfather Edmund Ironside, Ethelred for her great-grandfather Ethelred the Unready and Edgar for her great-great-grandfather Edgar and her brother, briefly the elected king, Edgar Ætheling — was unlikely to be missed in England, where William of Normandy&#x27;s grasp on power was far from secure. Whether the adoption of the classical Alexander for the future Alexander I of Scotland (either for Pope Alexander II or for Alexander the Great) and the biblical David for the future David I of Scotland represented a recognition that William of Normandy would not be easily removed, or was due to the repetition of Anglo-Saxon royal names — another Edmund had preceded Edgar — is not known. Margaret also gave Malcolm two daughters, Edith, who married Henry I of England, and Mary, who married Eustace III of Boulogne.

In 1072, with the Harrying of the North completed and his position again secure, William of Normandy came north with an army and a fleet. Malcolm met William at Abernethy and, in the words of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, &quot;became his man&quot; and handed over his eldest son Duncan as a hostage and arranged peace between William and Edgar. Accepting the overlordship of the king of the English was no novelty, as previous kings had done so without result. The same was true of Malcolm; his agreement with the English king was followed by further raids into Northumbria, which led to further trouble in the earldom and the killing of Bishop Walcher at Gateshead. In 1080, William sent his son Robert Curthose north with an army while his brother Odo punished the Northumbrians. Malcolm again made peace, and this time kept it for over a decade.

Malcolm faced little recorded internal opposition, except for Lulach&#x27;s son Máel Snechtai. In an unusual entry, for the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; contains little on Scotland, it says that in 1078:

Whatever provoked this strife, Máel Snechtai survived until 1085.

== Malcolm and William Rufus ==
When William Rufus became king of England after his father&#x27;s death, Malcolm did not intervene in the rebellions by supporters of William&#x27;s elder brother Robert Curthose which followed. In 1091, William Rufus confiscated Edgar Ætheling&#x27;s lands in England, and Edgar fled north to Scotland. In May, Malcolm marched south, not to raid and take slaves and plunder, but to besiege Newcastle, where the New Castle had been built by Robert Curthose in 1080. This appears to have been an attempt to advance the frontier south from the River Tweed to the River Tees. The threat was enough to bring the English king back from Normandy, where he had been fighting Robert Curthose. In September, learning of William Rufus&#x27;s approaching army, Malcolm withdrew north and the English followed. Unlike in 1072, Malcolm was prepared to fight, but a peace was arranged by Edgar Ætheling and Robert Curthose whereby Malcolm again acknowledged the overlordship of the English king.

In 1092, the peace began to break down. Based on the idea that the Scots controlled much of modern Cumbria, it had been supposed that William Rufus&#x27;s new castle at Carlisle and his settlement of English peasants in the surrounds was the cause. It is unlikely that Malcolm controlled Cumbria, and the dispute instead concerned the estates granted to Malcolm by William Rufus&#x27;s father in 1072 for his maintenance when visiting England. Malcolm sent messengers to discuss the question and William Rufus agreed to a meeting. Malcolm travelled south to Gloucester, stopping at Wilton Abbey to visit his daughter Edith and sister-in-law Cristina. Malcolm arrived there on 24 August 1093 to find that William Rufus refused to negotiate, insisting that the dispute be judged by the English barons. This Malcolm refused to accept and returned immediately to Scotland.

It does not appear that William Rufus intended to provoke a war, but, as the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports, war came:
Malcolm was accompanied by Edward, his eldest son by Margaret and probable heir-designate (or tánaiste), and by Edgar. Even by the standards of the time, the ravaging of Northumbria by the Scots was seen as harsh.

While marching north again, Malcolm was ambushed by Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria, whose lands he had devastated, near Alnwick on 13 November 1093. There he was killed by Arkil Morel, steward of Bamburgh Castle. The conflict became known as the Battle of Alnwick. Edward was mortally wounded in the same fight. Margaret, it is said, died soon after receiving the news of their deaths from Edgar. The Annals of Ulster say:
Malcolm&#x27;s body was taken to Tynemouth Priory for burial. The king&#x27;s body was sent north for reburial, in the reign of his son Alexander, at Dunfermline Abbey, or possibly Iona.

On 19 June 1250, following the canonisation of Malcolm&#x27;s wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret&#x27;s remains were disinterred and placed in a reliquary. It was claimed that as the reliquary was carried to the high altar of Dunfermline Abbey, past Malcolm&#x27;s grave, it became too heavy to move. As a result, Malcolm&#x27;s remains were also disinterred and buried next to Margaret beside the altar. The remains of Margaret and her husband were removed from Dunfermline by Abbot George Durie to safeguard them from the attacks of Protestant reformers; initially they went to the rural estate at Craigluscar then abroad, and by 1580 they were enshrined at the instigation of king Philip II of Spain in the royal monastery of St Lawrence near Madrid, San Lorenzo de El Escorial, where they remain.

== Issue ==

<doc id="20894" wikidata="Q1163115" url="?curid=20894" title="Maximum transmission unit">
<text>In computer networking, the maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest protocol data unit (PDU) that can be communicated in a single network layer transaction. The MTU relates to, but is not identical to the maximum frame size that can be transported on the data link layer, e.g., Ethernet frame.

Larger MTU is associated with reduced overhead. Smaller MTU values can reduce network delay. In many cases, MTU is dependent on underlying network capabilities and must be adjusted manually or automatically so as to not exceed these capabilities. MTU parameters may appear in association with a communications interface or standard. Some systems may decide MTU at connect time, e.g. using Path MTU Discovery.

==Applicability==
MTUs apply to communications protocols and network layers. The MTU is specified in terms of bytes or octets of the largest PDU that the layer can pass onwards. MTU parameters usually appear in association with a communications interface (NIC, serial port, etc.). Standards (Ethernet, for example) can fix the size of an MTU; or systems (such as point-to-point serial links) may decide MTU at connect time.

Underlying data link and physical layers usually add overhead to the network layer data to be transported, so for a given maximum frame size of a medium, one needs to subtract the amount of overhead to calculate that medium&#x27;s MTU. For example, with Ethernet, the maximum frame size is 1518 bytes, 18 bytes of which are overhead (header and frame check sequence), resulting in an MTU of 1500 bytes.

==Tradeoffs==
A larger MTU brings greater efficiency because each network packet carries more user data while protocol overheads, such as headers or underlying per-packet delays, remain fixed; the resulting higher efficiency means an improvement in bulk protocol throughput. A larger MTU also requires processing of fewer packets for the same amount of data. In some systems, per-packet-processing can be a critical performance limitation.

However, this gain is not without a downside. Large packets occupy a link for more time than a smaller packet, causing greater delays to subsequent packets, and increasing network delay and delay variation. For example, a 1500-byte packet, the largest allowed by Ethernet at the network layer, ties up a 14.4k modem for about one second.

Large packets are also problematic in the presence of communications errors. If no forward error correction is used, corruption of a single bit in a packet requires that the entire packet be retransmitted, which can be costly. At a given bit error rate, larger packets are more susceptible to corruption. Their greater payload makes retransmissions of larger packets take longer. Despite the negative effects on retransmission duration, large packets can still have a net positive effect on end-to-end TCP performance.

==Internet protocol==
The Internet protocol suite was designed to work over many different networking technologies, each of which may use packets of different sizes. While a host will know the MTU of its own interface and possibly that of its peers (from initial handshakes), it will not initially know the lowest MTU in a chain of links to other peers. Another potential problem is that higher-level protocols may create packets larger than even the local link supports.

IPv4 allows fragmentation which divides the datagram into pieces, each small enough to accommodate a specified MTU limitation. This fragmentation process takes place at the internet layer. The fragmented packets are marked so that the IP layer of the destination host knows it should reassemble the packets into the original datagram.

All fragments of a packet must arrive for the packet to be considered received. If the network drops any fragment, the entire packet is lost.

When the number of packets that must be fragmented or the number of fragments is great, fragmentation can cause unreasonable or unnecessary overhead. For example, various tunneling situations may exceed the MTU by very little as they add just a header&#x27;s worth of data. The addition is small, but each packet now has to be sent in two fragments, the second of which carries very little payload. The same amount of payload is being moved, but every intermediate router has to forward twice as many packets.

The Internet Protocol requires that hosts must be able to process IP datagrams of at least 576 bytes (for IPv4) or 1280 bytes (for IPv6). However, this does not preclude link layers with an MTU smaller than this minimum MTU from conveying IP data. For example, according to IPv6&#x27;s specification, if a particular link layer cannot deliver an IP datagram of 1280 bytes in a single frame, then the link layer must provide its own fragmentation and reassembly mechanism, separate from the IP fragmentation mechanism, to ensure that a 1280-byte IP datagram can be delivered, intact, to the IP layer.

===MTUs for common media===
In the context of Internet Protocol, MTU refers to the maximum size of an IP packet that can be transmitted without fragmentation over a given medium. The size of an IP packet includes IP headers but excludes headers from the link layer. In the case of an Ethernet frame this adds a protocol overhead of 18 bytes, or 22 bytes with an IEEE 802.1Q tag for VLAN tagging or class of service.

The MTU should not be confused with the minimum datagram size (in one piece or in fragments) that all hosts must be prepared to accept. This is 576 bytes for IPv4 and 1280 bytes for IPv6.

===Ethernet maximum frame size===
The IP MTU and Ethernet maximum frame size are configured separately. In Ethernet switch configuration, MTU may refer to Ethernet maximum frame size. In Ethernet-based routers, MTU normally refers to the IP MTU. If jumbo frames are allowed in a network, the IP MTU should also be adjusted upwards to take advantage of this.

Since the IP packet is carried by an Ethernet frame, the Ethernet frame has to be larger than the IP packet. With the normal untagged Ethernet frame overhead of 18 bytes and the 1500-byte payload, the Ethernet maximum frame size is 1518 bytes. If a 1500-byte IP packet is to be carried over a tagged Ethernet connection, the Ethernet frame maximum size needs to be 1522 bytes due to the larger size of an 802.1Q tagged frame. 802.3ac increases the standard Ethernet maximum frame size to accommodate this.

===Path MTU Discovery===

The Internet Protocol defines the &quot;path MTU&quot; of an Internet transmission path as the smallest MTU supported by any of the hops on the path between a source and destination. Put another way, the path MTU is the largest packet size that can traverse this path without suffering fragmentation.

&quot;Path MTU Discovery&quot; is a technique for determining the path MTU between two IP hosts, defined for both IPv4 and IPv6. It works by sending packets with the DF (don&#x27;t fragment) option in the IP header set. Any device along the path whose MTU is smaller than the packet will drop such packets and send back an ICMP Destination Unreachable (Datagram Too Big) message which indicates its MTU. This information allows the source host to reduce its assumed path MTU appropriately. The process repeats until the MTU becomes small enough to traverse the entire path without fragmentation.

Standard Ethernet supports an MTU of 1500 bytes and Ethernet implementation supporting jumbo frames, allow for an MTU up to 9000 bytes. However, border protocols like PPPoE will reduce this. Path MTU Discovery exposes the difference between the MTU seen by Ethernet end-nodes and the Path MTU.

Unfortunately, increasing numbers of networks drop ICMP traffic (for example, to prevent denial-of-service attacks), which prevents path MTU discovery from working. &quot;Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery&quot; is a Path MTU Discovery technique which responds more robustly to ICMP filtering. In an IP network, the path from the source address to the destination address may change in response to various events (load-balancing, congestion, outages, etc.) and this could result in the path MTU changing (sometimes repeatedly) during a transmission, which may introduce further packet drops before the host finds a new reliable MTU.

A failure of Path MTU Discovery carries the possible result of making some sites behind badly configured firewalls unreachable. A connection with mismatched MTU may work for low-volume data but fail as soon as a host sends a large block of data. For example, with Internet Relay Chat a connecting client might see the initial messages up to and including the initial ping (sent by the server as an anti-spoofing measure), but get no response after that. This is because the large set of welcome messages sent at that point are packets that exceed the path MTU. One can possibly work around this, depending on which part of the network one controls; for example one can change the MSS (maximum segment size) in the initial packet that sets up the TCP connection at one&#x27;s firewall.

==In other contexts==
MTU is sometimes used to describe the maximum PDU sizes in communication layers other than the network layer.
* Cisco Systems and MikroTik use &quot;L2 MTU&quot; for the maximum frame size.
* Dell/Force10 use &quot;MTU&quot; for the maximum frame size.
* Hewlett-Packard used just &quot;MTU&quot; for the maximum frame size including the optional IEEE 802.1Q tag.
* Juniper Networks use several MTU terms: &quot;Physical Interface MTU&quot; (L3 MTU plus some unspecified protocol overhead), &quot;Logical Interface MTU&quot; (consistent with IETF MTU) and &quot;Maximum MTU&quot; (maximum configurable frame size for jumbo frames).

The transmission of a packet on a physical network segment that is larger than the segment&#x27;s MTU is known as jabber. This is almost always caused by faulty devices. Network switches and some repeater hubs have a built-in capability to detect when a device is jabbering.

<doc id="20897" wikidata="Q594387" url="?curid=20897" title="Mount Baker">
<text>Mount Baker (; ), also known as Koma Kulshan or simply Kulshan, is a active glacier-covered andesitic stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the North Cascades of Washington State in the United States. Mount Baker has the second-most thermally active crater in the Cascade Range after Mount St. Helens. About due east of the city of Bellingham, Whatcom County, Mount Baker is the youngest volcano in the Mount Baker volcanic field. While volcanism has persisted here for some 1.5 million years, the current volcanic cone is likely no more than 140,000 years old, and possibly no older than 80–90,000 years. Older volcanic edifices have mostly eroded away due to glaciation.

After Mount Rainier, Mount Baker has the heaviest glacier cover of the Cascade Range volcanoes; the volume of snow and ice on Mount Baker, is greater than that of all the other Cascades volcanoes (except Rainier) combined. It is also one of the snowiest places in the world; in 1999, Mount Baker Ski Area, located to the northeast, set the world record for recorded snowfall in a single season—.

Mount Baker is the third-highest mountain in Washington and the fifth-highest in the Cascade Range, if Little Tahoma Peak, a subpeak of Mount Rainier, and Shastina, a subpeak of Mount Shasta, are not counted. Located in the Mount Baker Wilderness, it is visible from much of Greater Victoria, Nanaimo, and Greater Vancouver in British Columbia, and to the south, from Seattle (and on clear days Tacoma) in Washington.

Indigenous peoples have known the mountain for thousands of years, but the first written record of the mountain is from Spanish explorer Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, who mapped it in 1790 as &quot;&quot;. The explorer George Vancouver later named the mountain for 3rd Lieutenant Joseph Baker of HMS &quot;Discovery&quot;, who saw it on April 30, 1792.

== Name and etymology ==
Mount Baker is known to the several Indigenous peoples surrounding the mountain by different names.

The Nooksack, who live in the closest proximity to the north face of the mountain, have multiple names for different areas of the mountain. The name , meaning &quot;white mountain,&quot; refers to Mount Baker as a whole, and specifically, to the glacier-covered summit above 7,000 feet. The open slopes of Mt. Baker, between about 5,000 feet and 7,000 feet, are known as , meaning &quot;shooting place,&quot; referring to the act of going hunting up on the slopes. The third main name for the mountain is , meaning &quot;many meadows,&quot; refers to the sheltered meadows below around 5,500 feet.

The Upper Skagit peoples, who live in the closest proximity to the south face of the mountain along the Skagit River watershed, call the mountain in Lushootseed, which means &quot;permanently snow-covered mountain.&quot;

Other Indigenous peoples, such as the Lummi or Halkomelem-speaking peoples, use names for the mountain borrowed from the Nooksack term, as, due to the distance to the mountain from the core homelands of those peoples, only those closely related to the Nooksack might travel to hunt and gather with them at . Thus, the names for Mount Baker in Lummi and Halkomelem are &quot;&quot; and respectively. The name in the nearby Thompson language, , may be a loan from Nooksack or Halkomelem.

In the language of the unidentified &quot;Koma tribe,&quot; the name is &quot;Tukullum&quot; or &quot;Nahcullum.&quot;

The first Europeans to see and name the mountain were the Spanish. Gonzalo Lopez de Haro was the first European to record the mountain, calling it &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Great Mount Carmel&quot;.

The current English name for the mountain, Mount Baker, was chosen by George Vancouver. Vancouver named the mountain for 3rd Lieutenant Joseph Baker of HMS &quot;Discovery&quot;, who saw it on April 30, 1792.

Mount Baker is sometimes also known by the alternative English name &quot;Kulshan&quot; which is the Anglicized form of the Nooksack name . The other related name, &quot;Koma Kulshan,&quot; is likely the Anglicized version of the Nooksack phrase, , meaning &quot;go up into the mountains to .&quot;

==History==

Prior to European colonization, the Nooksack and Upper Skagit peoples hunted and gathered on the north and south faces of the mountain.

For the Nooksack, Mount Baker is extremely important in traditional religious beliefs, and was historically a great source of wealth (in the form of mountain goat wool, a highly prized commodity) and food. Nooksack families would travel via the North Fork () or Middle Fork () of the Nooksack River to the alpine meadows where they would set up temporary summer camps to dry picked berries and meat. From those camps, people would disperse across the mountain to pick berries or hunt. The high slopes of the mountain were prime territory for hunting deer, elk, mountain goat, bear, marmot, and grouse. Nooksack families held almost exclusive usage rights to the northwestern areas of the mountain, while the usage rights to the southeastern half were held by Skagit families. Certain families of tribes such as the Lummi or Halkomelem-speaking peoples could travel to the mountain if they were intermarried and closely allied with Nooksack families. This meant that some groups which had more hostile relations with the Nooksack, such as the Thompson, were generally barred from the mountain.

In 1790, Manuel Quimper of the Spanish Navy set sail from Nootka, a temporary settlement on Vancouver Island, with orders to explore the newly discovered Strait of Juan de Fuca. Accompanying Quimper was first-pilot Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, who drew detailed charts during the six-week expedition. Although Quimper&#x27;s journal of the voyage does not refer to the mountain, one of Haro&#x27;s manuscript charts includes a sketch of Mount Baker. The Spanish named the snowy volcano &quot;&quot;, as it reminded them of the white-clad monks of the Carmelite Monastery.

The British explorer George Vancouver left England a year later. His mission was to survey the northwest coast of North America. Vancouver and his crew reached the Pacific Northwest coast in 1792. While anchored in Dungeness Bay on the south shore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Joseph Baker made an observation of Mount Baker, which Vancouver recorded in his journal:
Six years later, the official narrative of this voyage was published, including the first printed reference to the mountain. By the mid-1850s, Mount Baker was a well-known feature on the horizon to the explorers and fur traders who traveled in the Puget Sound region. Isaac I. Stevens, the first governor of Washington Territory, wrote about Mount Baker in 1853:

==Climbing history==

===First European ascent===
Edmund Thomas Coleman, an Englishman who resided in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and a veteran of the Alps, made the first attempt to ascend the mountain in 1866. He chose a route via the Skagit River, but was forced to turn back when local Native Americans refused him passage.

Later that same year, Coleman recruited Whatcom County settlers Edward Eldridge, John Bennett, and John Tennant to aid him in his second attempt to scale the mountain. After approaching via the North Fork of the Nooksack River, the party navigated through what is now known as Coleman Glacier and ascended to within several hundred feet of the summit before turning back in the face of an &quot;overhanging cornice of ice&quot; and threatening weather. Coleman later returned to the mountain after two years. At 4:00 pm on August 17, 1868, Coleman, Eldridge, Tennant and two new companions (David Ogilvy and Thomas Stratton) scaled the summit via the Middle Fork Nooksack River, Marmot Ridge, Coleman Glacier, and the north margin of the Roman Wall.

==Geology==

The present-day cone of Mount Baker is relatively young, perhaps less than 100,000 years old. The volcano sits atop a similar older volcanic cone called Black Buttes, which was active between 500,000 and 300,000 years ago.

Much of Mount Baker&#x27;s earlier geological record eroded away during the last ice age (which culminated 15,000–20,000 years ago), by thick ice sheets that filled the valleys and surrounded the volcano. In the last 14,000 years, the area around the mountain has been largely ice-free, but the mountain itself remains heavily covered with snow and ice.

Isolated ridges of lava and hydrothermally altered rock, especially in the area of Sherman Crater, are exposed between glaciers on the upper flanks of the volcano; the lower flanks are steep and heavily vegetated. Volcanic rocks of Mount Baker and Black Buttes rest on a foundation of non-volcanic rocks.
Deposits recording the last 14,000 years at Mount Baker indicate that Mount Baker has not had highly explosive eruptions like those of other volcanoes in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, such as Mount St. Helens, Glacier Peak, or the Mount Meager massif, nor has it erupted frequently. During this period, four episodes of magmatic eruptive activity have been recently recognized.

Magmatic eruptions have produced tephra, pyroclastic flows, and lava flows from summit vents and the Schriebers Meadow Cone. The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been lahars or debris flows and debris avalanches. Many, if not most, of these were not related to magmatic eruptions, but may have been induced by magma intrusion, steam eruptions, earthquakes, gravitational instability, or possibly even heavy rainfall.

===Eruptive history===

====Early history====
Research beginning in the late 1990s shows that Mount Baker is the youngest of several volcanic centers in the area and one of the youngest volcanoes in the Cascade Range. The Pliocene Hannegan caldera is preserved northeast of Mount Baker Volcanic activity in the Mount Baker volcanic field began more than one million years ago, but many of the earliest lava and tephra deposits have been removed by glacial erosion. The pale-colored rocks northeast of the modern volcano mark the site of the ancient (1.15  million years old) Kulshan caldera that collapsed after an enormous ash eruption one million years ago. Subsequently, eruptions in the Mount Baker area have produced cones and lava flows of andesite, the rock that constitutes much of the other Cascade Range volcanoes such as Rainier, Adams, and Hood. From about 900,000  years ago to the present, numerous andesitic volcanic centers in the area have come and disappeared through glacial erosion. The largest of these cones is the Black Buttes edifice, active between 500,000 and 300,000  years ago and formerly bigger than today&#x27;s Mount Baker.

====Modern craters and cone====

Mount Baker was built from stacks of lava and volcanic breccia prior to the end of the last glacial period, which ended about 15,000 years ago. Two craters are on the mountain. Ice-filled Carmelo Crater is under the summit ice dome. This crater is the source for the last cone-building eruptions
The highest point of Mount Baker, Grant Peak, is on the exposed southeast rim of Carmelo Crater, which is a small pile of andesitic scoria lying on top of a stack of lava flows just below. Carmelo Crater is deeply dissected on its south side by the younger Sherman Crater. This crater is south of the summit, and its ice-covered floor is below the summit ice dome. This crater is the site of all Holocene eruptive activity. Hundreds of fumaroles vent gases, primarily , , and .

Lava flows from the summit vent erupted between 30,000 and 10,000 years ago, and during the final stages of edifice construction, blocky pyroclastic flows entered the volcano&#x27;s southeastern drainages. An eruption from Sherman Crater 6,600 years ago erupted a blanket of ash that extended more than to the east. Today, sulfurous gases reach the surface via two fumarole pathways: Dorr Fumarole, northeast of the summit, and Sherman Crater, south of the summit. Both are sites of hydrothermal alteration, converting lavas to weak, white-to-yellow clays; sulfur is a common mineral around these fumaroles. At Sherman Crater, collapses of this weakened rock generated lahars in the 1840s.

====Mazama Park eruptive period: 6,600 years ago====
Source:

Around 6,600 years ago, a series of discrete events culminated in the largest tephra-producing eruption in postglacial time at Mount Baker. This is the last episode of undoubted magmatic activity preserved in the geologic record. First, the largest collapse in the history of the volcano occurred from the Roman Wall and transformed into a lahar that was over deep in the upper reaches of the Middle Fork of the Nooksack River. It was at least deep downstream from the volcano. At that time, the Nooksack River is believed to have drained north into the Fraser River; this lahar is unlikely to have reached Bellingham Bay. Next, a small hydrovolcanic eruption occurred at Sherman Crater, triggering a second collapse of the flank just east of the Roman Wall. That collapse also became a lahar that mainly followed the course of the first lahar for at least , and also spilled into tributaries of the Baker River. Finally, an eruption cloud deposited ash as far as downwind to the northeast and east.

====Historical activity====
Several eruptions occurred from Sherman Crater during the 19th century; they were witnessed from the Bellingham area. A possible eruption was seen in June 1792 during the Spanish expedition of Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and Cayetano Valdés. Their report read, in part: Most of Mount Baker&#x27;s eruptions that have a confirmed VEI level had a VEI of 2 but two possible eruptions had a VEI of 3.

In 1843, explorers reported a widespread layer of newly fallen rock fragments &quot;like a snowfall&quot; and that the forest was &quot;on fire for miles around&quot;. These fires were unlikely to have been caused by ashfall, however, as charred material is not found with deposits of this fine-grained volcanic ash, which was almost certainly cooled in the atmosphere before falling. Rivers south of the volcano were reportedly clogged with ash, and Native Americans reported that many salmon perished. Reports of flooding on the Skagit River from the eruption are, however, probably greatly exaggerated. A short time later, two collapses of the east side of Sherman Crater produced two lahars, the first and larger of which flowed into the natural Baker Lake, increasing its level by at least . The location of the 19th-century lake is now covered by waters of the modern dam-impounded Baker Lake. Similar but lower-level hydrovolcanic activity at Sherman Crater continued intermittently for several decades afterward. On 26 November 1860, passengers who were traveling by steamer from New Westminster to Victoria reported that Mount Baker was &quot;puffing out large volumes of smoke, which upon breaking, rolled down the snow-covered sides of the mountain, forming a pleasing effect of light and shade.&quot; In 1891, about of rock fell producing a lahar that traveled more than and covered .

Activity in the 20th century decreased from the 19th century. Numerous small debris avalanches fell from Sherman Peak and descended the Boulder Glacier; a large one occurred on July 27, 2007. In early March 1975, a dramatic increase in fumarolic activity and snow melt in the Sherman Crater area raised concern that an eruption might be imminent. Heat flow increased more than tenfold. Additional monitoring equipment was installed and several geophysical surveys were conducted to try to detect the movement of magma. The increased thermal activity prompted public officials and Puget Power to temporarily close public access to the popular Baker Lake recreation area and to lower the reservoir&#x27;s water level by . If those actions had not been taken, significant avalanches of debris from the Sherman Crater area could have swept directly into the reservoir, triggering a disastrous wave that could have caused human fatalities and damage to the reservoir. Other than the increased heat flow, few anomalies were recorded during the geophysical surveys, nor were any other precursory activities observed that would indicate that magma was moving up into the volcano. Several small lahars formed from material ejected onto the surrounding glaciers and acidic water was discharged into Baker Lake for many months.

Activity gradually declined over the next two years, but stabilized at a higher level than before 1975. The increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at Mount Baker since 1975, but no other changes suggest that magma movement is involved.

====Current research at Mount Baker====
A considerable amount of research has been done at Mount Baker over the past decade, and it is now among the most-studied of the Cascade Volcanoes. Recent and ongoing projects include gravimetric and GPS-based geodetic monitoring, fumarole gas sampling, tephra distribution mapping, new interpretations of the Schriebers Meadow lava flow, and hazards analyses. Mapping of Carmelo and Sherman craters, and interpretations of the eruptive history, continue, as well. The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.

===Climate===
Mount Baker has an alpine tundra climate (ET)
===Glaciers and hydrology===

Eleven named glaciers descend from Mount Baker. Two additional glaciers (Hadley Glacier and Sholes Glacier) descend from lower slopes detached from the main glacial mass. The Coleman Glacier is the largest; it has a surface area of . The other large glaciers—which have areas greater than —are Roosevelt Glacier, Mazama Glacier, Park Glacier, Boulder Glacier, Easton Glacier, and Deming Glacier. All retreated during the first half of the century, advanced from 1950 to 1975 and have been retreating with increasing rapidity since 1980.

Mount Baker is drained on the north by streams that flow into the North Fork Nooksack River, on the west by the Middle Fork Nooksack River, and on the southeast and east by tributaries of the Baker River. Lake Shannon and Baker Lake are the largest nearby bodies of water, formed by two dams on the Baker River.

==U.S. Navy==
Two ammunition ships of the United States Navy (traditionally named for volcanoes) have been named after the mountain. The first was USS &quot;Mount Baker&quot; (AE-4), which was commissioned from 1941 to 1947 and from 1951 to 1969. In 1972, the Navy commissioned USS &quot;Mount Baker&quot; (AE-34). She was decommissioned in 1996 and placed in service with the Military Sealift Command as USNS &quot;Mount Baker&quot; (T-AE-34). She was scrapped in 2012.

<text>Strategic sealift ships are part of the United States Military Sealift Command&#x27;s (MSC) prepositioning program. There are currently 17 ships in the program, strategically positioned around the world to support the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Defense Logistics Agency. Most are named after Medal of Honor recipients from the service they support. The ships are assigned to two Military Prepositioning Ship (MPS) squadrons located in the Indian Ocean at Diego Garcia and in the Western Pacific Ocean at Guam and Saipan. 

The MPS ships in each squadron have sufficient equipment, supplies and ammunition to support a Marine Air-Ground Task Force for 30 days. The MPS ships are self-sustaining, with cranes to unload at sea or pierside. MSC chartered the first two ship classes in the MPS role (the &quot;Corporal Louis J. Hauge Jr.&quot; and &quot;Sergeant Matej Kocak&quot; classes) from civilian shipping lines and converted them. Later ships were purpose-built.

==Ships==
===&quot;Sergeant Matej Kocak&quot; class===

The &quot;Sergeant Matej Kocak&quot; class, the second class of MPS ships chartered by MSC, also gained amidships and a helicopter deck after conversion. These ships, delivered to MSC in the mid-1980s, built at Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co., Chester, Pennsylvania, and converted at National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, San Diego. They were previously owned by Waterman Steamship Corporation but recently sold to MSC and now operated by Keystone Shipping Company. They were all part of the Waterman Line C7-S-133a Series.

<doc id="20900" wikidata="Q76657" url="?curid=20900" title="Mathias Rust">
<text>Mathias Rust (born 1 June 1968) is a German aviator known for his flight that ended with a landing near Red Square in Moscow on 28 May 1987. Then a teenage amateur pilot, he flew from Helsinki, Finland, to Moscow, without authorization. According to Russian claims he was tracked several times by Soviet Air Defence Forces and civilian air traffic controllers, as well as Soviet Air Force interceptor aircraft. The Soviet fighters did not receive permission to shoot him down, and his aeroplane was mistaken for a friendly aircraft several times. Also, 28 May 1987 was Border Guards Day, leaving many guards distracted. He landed on Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge, next to Red Square near the Kremlin in the capital of the USSR.

Rust said he wanted to create an &quot;imaginary bridge&quot; to the East, and that his flight was intended to reduce tension and suspicion between the two Cold War sides. Rust was sentenced to four years in a general-regime labour camp for violation of border crossing and air traffic regulations, and for provoking an emergency situation upon his landing. After 14 months in prison, he was pardoned by Andrei Gromyko, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and released.

Rust&#x27;s flight through a supposedly impenetrable air defence system had a great effect on the Soviet military and resulted in the dismissal of many senior officers, including Minister of Defence Marshal of the USSR Sergei Sokolov and the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, former World War II fighter pilot ace Chief Marshal Alexander Koldunov. The incident aided Mikhail Gorbachev in the implementation of his reforms, by allowing him to dismiss numerous military officials opposed to his policies.

==Moscow flight==

Rust, aged 18, was an inexperienced pilot, with about 50 hours of flying experience at the time of his flight. On 13 May 1987, Rust left Uetersen Airport, near Hamburg and his home town Wedel, in his rented Reims Cessna F172P, registration D-ECJB, which was modified by removing some of the seats and replacing them with auxiliary fuel tanks. He spent the next two weeks travelling across northern Europe, visiting the Faroe Islands, spending a week in Iceland, and then visiting Bergen on his way back. He was later quoted as saying that he had the idea of attempting to reach Moscow even before the departure, and he considered the journey to Iceland (where he visited Hofdi House, the site of unsuccessful talks between the USA&#x27;s and USSR&#x27;s governments during October 1986) as a method of testing his piloting skills.

On 28 May 1987, Rust refuelled at Helsinki-Malmi Airport. He told air traffic control that he was going to Stockholm, and took off at 12:21. Immediately after his final communication with traffic control, he turned his plane to the east near Nummela, Vihti. Air traffic controllers tried to contact him as he was moving around the busy Helsinki–Moscow route, but Rust had turned off all his communications equipment.

Rust disappeared from the Finnish air traffic radar near Espoo. Control personnel presumed an emergency and a rescue effort was organized, including a Finnish Border Guard patrol boat. They found an oil patch near Sipoo where Rust had disappeared from radar observation, and conducted an underwater search but did not find anything.

Rust crossed the Baltic coastline over Estonia and turned towards Moscow. At 14:29 he appeared on Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) radar and, after failure to reply to an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) signal, was assigned combat number 8255. Three surface-to-air missile battalions of 54th Air Defence Corps tracked him for some time, but failed to obtain permission to launch missiles at him. All air defences were readied and two interceptors were sent to investigate. At 14:48, near Gdov, MiG-23 pilot Senior Lieutenant A. Puchnin observed a white sport airplane similar to a Yakovlev Yak-12 and asked for permission to engage, but was denied.

The fighters lost contact with Rust soon after this. While they were being directed back to him, he disappeared from radar near Staraya Russa. West German magazine &quot;Bunte&quot; speculated that he might have landed there for some time, noting that he changed his clothes during his flight and that he took too much time to fly to Moscow considering his airplane&#x27;s speed and the weather conditions.

Air defence re-established contact with Rust&#x27;s plane several times but confusion resulted from all of these events. The PVO system had shortly before been divided into several districts, which simplified management but created additional work for tracking officers at the districts&#x27; borders. The local air regiment near Pskov was on maneuvers and, due to inexperienced pilots&#x27; tendency to forget correct IFF designator settings, local control officers assigned all traffic in the area friendly status, including Rust.

Near Torzhok, there was a similar situation, as increased air traffic was created by a search and rescue operation. Rust, flying a slow propeller-driven aircraft, was confused with one of the helicopters participating with the operation. He was detected several more times and given false friendly recognition twice. Rust was considered as a domestic training airplane defying regulations, and was assigned the least priority by air defense.

Around 19:00, Rust appeared above Moscow. He had initially intended to land in the Kremlin, but he reasoned that landing inside, hidden by the Kremlin walls, would have allowed the KGB to arrest him and deny the incident. Therefore, he changed his landing place to Red Square. Dense pedestrian traffic did not allow him to land there either, so after circling about the square one more time, he was able to land on Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge by St. Basil&#x27;s Cathedral. A later inquiry found that trolleybus wires normally strung over the bridge—which would have prevented his landing there—had been removed for maintenance that morning, and were replaced the next day. After taxiing past the cathedral, he stopped about from the square, where he was greeted by curious passersby and asked for autographs. When asked where he was from, he replied &quot;Germany&quot; making the bystanders think he was from East Germany; but when he said West Germany, they were surprised. A British doctor videotaped Rust circling over Red Square and landing on the bridge. Rust was arrested two hours later.

==Aftermath==
Rust&#x27;s trial began in Moscow on 2 September 1987. He was sentenced to four years in a general-regime labour camp for hooliganism, for disregard of aviation laws, and for breaching the Soviet border. He was never transferred to a labour camp, and instead served his time at the high security Lefortovo temporary detention facility in Moscow. Two months later, Reagan and Gorbachev agreed to sign a treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe, and the Supreme Soviet ordered Rust to be released in August 1988 as a goodwill gesture to the West.

Rust&#x27;s return to Germany on 3 August 1988 was accompanied by huge media attention, but he did not talk to the journalists assembled; his family had sold the exclusive rights to the story to the German magazine &quot;Stern&quot; for 100,000 DM. He reported that he had been treated well in the Soviet prison. Journalists described him as &quot;psychologically unstable and unworldly in a dangerous manner&quot;.

William E. Odom, former director of the U.S. National Security Agency and author of &quot;The Collapse of the Soviet Military&quot;, says that Rust&#x27;s flight irreparably damaged the reputation of the Soviet military. This enabled Gorbachev to remove many of the strongest opponents to his reforms. Minister of Defence Sergei Sokolov and the commander of the Soviet Air Defence Forces Alexander Koldunov were dismissed along with hundreds of other officers. This was the biggest turnover in the Soviet military since Stalin&#x27;s purges 50 years earlier.

Rust&#x27;s rented Reims Cessna F172P (serial #F17202087), registered &quot;D-ECJB&quot;, was sold to Japan where it was exhibited for several years. In 2008 it was returned to Germany and was placed in the German Museum of Technology in Berlin.

Because Rust&#x27;s flight seemed harmful to the authority of the Soviet regime, it was the source of numerous jokes and legends. For a while after the incident, Red Square was referred to jokingly by some Muscovites as Sheremetyevo-3 (Sheremetyevo-1 and -2 being the two terminals at Moscow&#x27;s international airport). At the end of 1987, the police radio code used by law enforcement officers in Moscow was allegedly updated to include a code for an aircraft landing.

At Saka Manor Park in Estonia, there is a monument dedicated to Rust&#x27;s flight.

==Later life==
On 24 November 1989, while doing his obligatory community service (&quot;Zivildienst&quot;) as an orderly in a West German hospital, Rust stabbed a female co-worker who had &quot;apparently rejected him.&quot; He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, but was released after 15 months. Since then, he has lived a fragmented life, describing himself as a &quot;bit of an oddball&quot;. After being released from court, he converted to Hinduism in 1996 to become engaged to a daughter of an Indian tea merchant. In 2001, he was convicted of stealing a cashmere pullover and ordered to pay a fine of 10,000 DM, which was later reduced to 600 DM. Another legal incident occurred during 2005, when he was convicted of fraud and had to pay a €1,500 fine. In 2009, Rust described himself as a professional poker player. Most recently, in 2012, he described himself as an analyst for a Zürich-based investment bank, dividing his time between Hamburg, Switzerland and Asia, and is training to be a yoga teacher. He said he had plans to open a yoga school in Hamburg.

=== Peace activism ===
In October 2015, &quot;The Hindu&quot; published an interview with Rust to commemorate the 25th anniversary of German reunification. Rust opined that institutional failures in Western countries to preserve moral standards and democratic ideals were creating mistrust between peoples and governments. Referring to the genesis of a New Cold War between Russia and the Western powers, Rust suggested that India should be cautious and avoid entanglement: &quot;India will be better served if it follows a policy of neutrality while interacting with EU member countries as the big European powers at present are following the foreign policy of the U.S. unquestioningly&quot;. He claimed: &quot;Governments have been dominated by the corporate entities and citizens have ceased to matter in public policy&quot;.

==In the media==
After the 20th anniversary of his flight on 28 May 2007, international media interviewed Rust about the flight and its aftermath.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Bild&quot; both have online editions of their interviews. The most comprehensive televised interview available online is produced by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation. In their interview &quot;Rust in Red Square&quot;, recorded in May 2007, Rust gives a full account of the flight in English.

<text>Malware (a portmanteau of malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which unknowingly interferes with the user&#x27;s computer security and privacy. Researchers tend to classify malware into one or more sub-types (i.e. computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, logic bombs, ransomware, spyware, adware, rogue software, wipers and keyloggers).

Malware poses serious problems to individuals and businesses on the Internet. According to Symantec&#x27;s 2018 Internet Security Threat Report (ISTR), malware variants number has increased to 669,947,865 in 2017, which is twice as many malware variants as in 2016. Cybercrime, which includes malware attacks as well as other crimes committed by computer, was predicted to cost the world economy US$6 trillion in 2021, and is increasing at a rate of 15% per year. Since 2021, malware has been designed to target computer systems that run critical infrastructure such as the electricity distribution network.

The defense strategies against malware differ according to the type of malware but most can be thwarted by installing antivirus software, firewalls, applying regular patches, securing networks from intrusion, having regular backups and isolating infected systems. Malware can be designed to evade antivirus software detection algorithms.

==History==

The notion of a self-reproducing computer program can be traced back to initial theories about the operation of complex automata. John von Neumann showed that in theory a program could reproduce itself. This constituted a plausibility result in computability theory. Fred Cohen experimented with computer viruses and confirmed Neumann&#x27;s postulate and investigated other properties of malware such as detectability and self-obfuscation using rudimentary encryption. His 1987 doctoral dissertation was on the subject of computer viruses. The combination of cryptographic technology as part of the payload of the virus, exploiting it for attack purposes was initialized and investigated from the mid-1990s, and includes initial ransomware and evasion ideas.

Before Internet access became widespread, viruses spread on personal computers by infecting executable programs or boot sectors of floppy disks. By inserting a copy of itself into the machine code instructions in these programs or boot sectors, a virus causes itself to be run whenever the program is run or the disk is booted. Early computer viruses were written for the Apple II and Mac, but they became more widespread with the dominance of the IBM PC and MS-DOS. The first IBM PC virus in the wild was a boot sector virus dubbed (c)Brain, created in 1986 by the Farooq Alvi brothers in Pakistan. Malware distributors would trick the user into booting or running from an infected device or medium. For example, a virus could make an infected computer add autorunnable code to any USB stick plugged into it. Anyone who then attached the stick to another computer set to autorun from USB would in turn become infected, and also pass on the infection in the same way.

Older email software would automatically open HTML email containing potentially malicious JavaScript code. Users may also execute disguised malicious email attachments. The &quot;2018 Data Breach Investigations Report&quot; by Verizon, cited by CSO Online, states that emails are the primary method of malware delivery, accounting for 96% of malware delivery around the world.

The first worms, network-borne infectious programs, originated not on personal computers, but on multitasking Unix systems. The first well-known worm was the Morris worm of 1988, which infected SunOS and VAX BSD systems. Unlike a virus, this worm did not insert itself into other programs. Instead, it exploited security holes (vulnerabilities) in network server programs and started itself running as a separate process. This same behavior is used by today&#x27;s worms as well.

With the rise of the Microsoft Windows platform in the 1990s, and the flexible macros of its applications, it became possible to write infectious code in the macro language of Microsoft Word and similar programs. These &quot;macro viruses&quot; infect documents and templates rather than applications (executables), but rely on the fact that macros in a Word document are a form of executable code.

Many early infectious programs, including the Morris Worm, the first internet worm, were written as experiments or pranks. Today, malware is used by both black hat hackers and governments to steal personal, financial, or business information. Today, any device that plugs into a USB port – even lights, fans, speakers, toys, or peripherals such as a digital microscope – can be used to spread malware. Devices can be infected during manufacturing or supply if quality control is inadequate.

==Purposes==
Since the rise of widespread broadband Internet access, malicious software has more frequently been designed for profit. Since 2003, the majority of widespread viruses and worms have been designed to take control of users&#x27; computers for illicit purposes. Infected &quot;zombie computers&quot; can be used to send email spam, to host contraband data such as child pornography, or to engage in distributed denial-of-service attacks as a form of extortion. Malware is used broadly against government or corporate websites to gather sensitive information, or to disrupt their operation in general. Further, malware can be used against individuals to gain information such as personal identification numbers or details, bank or credit card numbers, and passwords.&lt;ref name=&quot;theregister/2022-raccoon&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to criminal money-making, malware can be used for sabotage, often for political motives. Stuxnet, for example, was designed to disrupt very specific industrial equipment. There have been politically motivated attacks which spread over and shut down large computer networks, including massive deletion of files and corruption of master boot records, described as &quot;computer killing.&quot; Such attacks were made on Sony Pictures Entertainment (25 November 2014, using malware known as Shamoon or W32.Disttrack) and Saudi Aramco (August 2012).

==Types==
Malware can be classified in numerous ways, and certain malicious programs may fall into two or more categories simultaneously. Broadly, software can categorised into three types: (i) goodware; (ii) greyware and (iii) malware.
===Malware===

====Virus====
A computer virus is software usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that can produce copies of itself and insert them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a harmful action (such as destroying data). They have been likened to biological viruses. An example of this is a portable execution infection, a technique, usually used to spread malware, that inserts extra data or executable code into PE files. A computer virus is software that embeds itself in some other executable software (including the operating system itself) on the target system without the user&#x27;s knowledge and consent and when it is run, the virus is spread to other executable files.

====Worm====

A worm is a stand-alone malware software that transmits itself over a network to infect other computers and can copy itself without infecting files. These definitions lead to the observation that a virus requires the user to run an infected software or operating system for the virus to spread, whereas a worm spreads itself.

====Rootkits====
Once malicious software is installed on a system, it is essential that it stays concealed, to avoid detection. Software packages known as &quot;rootkits&quot; allow this concealment, by modifying the host&#x27;s operating system so that the malware is hidden from the user. Rootkits can prevent a harmful process from being visible in the system&#x27;s list of processes, or keep its files from being read.

Some types of harmful software contain routines to evade identification and/or removal attempts, not merely to hide themselves. An early example of this behavior is recorded in the Jargon File tale of a pair of programs infesting a Xerox CP-V time sharing system:

====Backdoors====
A backdoor is a broad term for a computer program that allows an attacker persistent unauthorised remote access to a victim&#x27;s machine often without their knowledge. The attacker typically uses another attack (such as a trojan, worm or virus) to bypass authentication mechanisms usually over an unsecured network such as the Internet to install the backdoor application. A backdoor can also be a side effect of a software bug in legitimate software that is exploited by an attacker to gain access to a victim&#x27;s computer or network.

The idea has often been suggested that computer manufacturers preinstall backdoors on their systems to provide technical support for customers, but this has never been reliably verified. It was reported in 2014 that US government agencies had been diverting computers purchased by those considered &quot;targets&quot; to secret workshops where software or hardware permitting remote access by the agency was installed, considered to be among the most productive operations to obtain access to networks around the world. Backdoors may be installed by Trojan horses, worms, implants, or other methods.

====Trojan horse====
A Trojan horse misrepresents itself to masquerade as a regular, benign program or utility in order to persuade a victim to install it. A Trojan horse usually carries a hidden destructive function that is activated when the application is started. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the Trojan horse used to invade the city of Troy by stealth.

Trojan horses are generally spread by some form of social engineering, for example, where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to be unsuspicious, (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by drive-by download. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller (phoning home) which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer, potentially installing additional software such as a keylogger to steal confidential information, cryptomining software or adware to generate revenue to the operator of the trojan. While Trojan horses and backdoors are not easily detectable by themselves, computers may appear to run slower, emit more heat or fan noise due to heavy processor or network usage, as may occur when cryptomining software is installed. Cryptominers may limit resource usage and/or only run during idle times in an attempt to evade detection.

Unlike computer viruses and worms, Trojan horses generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.

In spring 2017, Mac users were hit by the new version of Proton Remote Access Trojan (RAT) trained to extract password data from various sources, such as browser auto-fill data, the Mac-OS keychain, and password vaults.

====Droppers====
Droppers are a sub-type of Trojans that solely aim to deliver malware upon the system that they infect with the desire to subvert detection through stealth and a light payload. It is important not to confuse a dropper with a loader or stager. A loader or stager will merely load an extension of the malware (for example a collection of malicious functions through reflective dynamic link library injection) into memory. The purpose is to keep the initial stage light and undetectable. A dropper merely downloads further malware to the system.

====Ransomware====

Ransomware prevents a user from accessing their files until a ransom is paid. There are two variations of ransomware, being crypto ransomware and locker ransomware. Locker ransomware just locks down a computer system without encrypting its contents, whereas crypto ransomware locks down a system and encrypts its contents. For example, programs such as CryptoLocker encrypt files securely, and only decrypt them on payment of a substantial sum of money.

Lock-screens, or screen lockers is a type of &quot;cyber police&quot; ransomware that blocks screens on Windows or Android devices with a false accusation in harvesting illegal content, trying to scare the victims into paying up a fee.
Jisut and SLocker impact Android devices more than other lock-screens, with Jisut making up nearly 60 percent of all Android ransomware detections.

Encryption-based ransomware, like the name suggests, is a type of ransomware that encrypts all files on an infected machine. These types of malware then display a pop-up informing the user that their files have been encrypted and that they must pay (usually in Bitcoin) to recover them. Some examples of encryption-based ransomware are CryptoLocker and WannaCry.

====Click Fraud====
Some malware is used to generate money by click fraud, making it appear that the computer user has clicked an advertising link on a site, generating a payment from the advertiser. It was estimated in 2012 that about 60 to 70% of all active malware used some kind of click fraud, and 22% of all ad-clicks were fraudulent.

===Grayware===
Grayware is any unwanted application or file that can worsen the performance of computers and may cause security risks but which there is insufficient consensus or data to classify them as malware. Types of greyware typically includes spyware, adware, fraudulent dialers, joke programs (&quot;jokeware&quot;) and remote access tools. For example, at one point, Sony BMG compact discs silently installed a rootkit on purchasers&#x27; computers with the intention of preventing illicit copying.

====Potentially unwanted program====
Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) are applications that would be considered unwanted despite often being intentionally downloaded by the user. PUPs include spyware, adware, and fraudulent dialers.

Many security products classify unauthorised key generators as PUPs, although they frequently carry true malware in addition to their ostensible purpose. In fact, Kammerstetter et al. (2012) estimated that as much as 55% of key generators could contain malware and that about 36% malicious key generators were not detected by antivirus software.

====Adware====
Some types of adware turn off anti-malware and virus protection; technical remedies are available.

====Spyware====
Programs designed to monitor users&#x27; web browsing, display unsolicited advertisements, or redirect affiliate marketing revenues are called spyware. Spyware programs do not spread like viruses; instead they are generally installed by exploiting security holes. They can also be hidden and packaged together with unrelated user-installed software. The Sony BMG rootkit was intended to prevent illicit copying; but also reported on users&#x27; listening habits, and unintentionally created extra security vulnerabilities.

==Detection==
Antivirus software typically uses two techniques to detect malware: (i) static analysis and (ii) dynamic/heuristic analysis. Static analysis involves studying the software code of a potentially malicious program and producing a signature of that program. This information is then used to compare scanned files by an antivirus program. Because this approach is not useful for malware that has not yet been studied, antivirus software can use dynamic analysis to monitor how the program runs on a computer and block it if it performs unexpected activity.

The aim of any malware is to conceal itself from detection by users or antivirus software. Detecting potential malware is difficult for two reasons. The first is that it is difficult to determine if software is malicious. The second is that malware uses technical measures to make it more difficult to detect it. An estimated 33% of malware is not detected by antivirus software.

The most commonly employed anti-detection technique involves encrypting the malware payload in order to prevent antivirus software from recognizing the signature. Tools such as crypters come with an encrypted blob of malicious code and a decryption stub. The stub decrypts the blob and loads it into memory. Because antivirus does not typically scan memory and only scans files on the drive, this allows the malware to evade detection. Advanced malware has the ability to transform itself into different variations, making it less likely to be detected due to the differences in its signatures. This is known as polymorphic malware. Other common techniques used to evade detection include, from common to uncommon: (1) evasion of analysis and detection by fingerprinting the environment when executed; (2) confusing automated tools&#x27; detection methods. This allows malware to avoid detection by technologies such as signature-based antivirus software by changing the server used by the malware; (3) timing-based evasion. This is when malware runs at certain times or following certain actions taken by the user, so it executes during certain vulnerable periods, such as during the boot process, while remaining dormant the rest of the time; (4) obfuscating internal data so that automated tools do not detect the malware; (v) information hiding techniques, namely stegomalware; and (5) fileless malware which runs within memory instead of using files and utilizes existing system tools to carry out malicious acts. The use of existing binaries to carry out malicious activities is a technique known as LotL, or Living off the Land. This reduces the amount of forensic artifacts available to analyze. Recently these types of attacks have become more frequent with a 432% increase in 2017 and makeup 35% of the attacks in 2018. Such attacks are not easy to perform but are becoming more prevalent with the help of exploit-kits.

==Risks==

===Vulnerable software===
A vulnerability is a weakness, flaw or software bug in an application, a complete computer, an operating system, or a computer network that is exploited by malware to bypass defences or gain privileges it requires to run. For example, TestDisk 6.4 or earlier contained a vulnerability that allowed attackers to inject code into Windows. Malware can exploit security defects (security bugs or vulnerabilities) in the operating system, applications (such as browsers, e.g. older versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer supported by Windows XP), or in vulnerable versions of browser plugins such as Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Acrobat or Reader, or Java SE. For example, a common method is exploitation of a buffer overrun vulnerability, where software designed to store data in a specified region of memory does not prevent more data than the buffer can accommodate from being supplied. Malware may provide data that overflows the buffer, with malicious executable code or data after the end; when this payload is accessed it does what the attacker, not the legitimate software, determines.

Malware can exploit recently discovered vulnerabilities before developers have had time to release a suitable patch. Even when new patches addressing the vulnerability have been released, they may not necessarily be installed immediately, allowing malware to take advantage of systems lacking patches. Sometimes even applying patches or installing new versions does not automatically uninstall the old versions.

There are several ways the users can stay informed and protected from security vulnerabilities in software.
Software providers often announce updates that address security issues. 
Common vulnerabilities are assigned unique identifiers (CVE IDs) and listed in public databases like the National Vulnerability Database.
Tools like Secunia PSI, free for personal use, can scan a computer for outdated software with known vulnerabilities and attempt to update them.
Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems can monitor the network traffic for suspicious activity that might indicate an attack.

===Excessive privileges===
Users and programs can be assigned more privileges than they require, and malware can take advantage of this. For example, of 940 Android apps sampled, one third of them asked for more privileges than they required. Apps targeting the Android platform can be a major source of malware infection but one solution is to use third-party software to detect apps that have been assigned excessive privileges.

Some systems allow all users to make changes to the core components or settings of the system, which is considered over-privileged access today. This was the standard operating procedure for early microcomputer and home computer systems, where there was no distinction between an &quot;administrator&quot; or &quot;root&quot;, and a regular user of the system. In some systems, non-administrator users are over-privileged by design, in the sense that they are allowed to modify internal structures of the system. In some environments, users are over-privileged because they have been inappropriately granted administrator or equivalent status. This can be because users tend to demand more privileges than they need, so often end up being assigned unnecessary privileges.

Some systems allow code executed by a user to access all rights of that user, which is known as over-privileged code. This was also standard operating procedure for early microcomputer and home computer systems. Malware, running as over-privileged code, can use this privilege to subvert the system. Almost all currently popular operating systems, and also many scripting applications allow code too many privileges, usually in the sense that when a user executes code, the system allows that code all rights of that user.

===Weak passwords===
A credential attack occurs when a user account with administrative privileges is cracked and that account is used to provide malware with appropriate privileges. Typically, the attack succeeds because the weakest form of account security is used, which is typically a short password that can be cracked using a dictionary or brute force attack. Using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication can reduce this risk. With the latter enabled, even if an attacker can crack the password, they cannot use the account without also having the token possessed by the legitimate user of that account.

===Use of the same operating system===
Homogeneity can be a vulnerability. For example, when all computers in a network run the same operating system, upon exploiting one, one worm can exploit them all: In particular, Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X have such a large share of the market that an exploited vulnerability concentrating on either operating system could subvert a large number of systems. It is estimated that approximately 83% of malware infections between January and March 2020 were spread via systems running Windows 10. This risk is mitigated by segmenting the networks into different subnetworks and setting up firewalls to block traffic between them.

==Mitigation==

===Antivirus / Anti-malware software===
Anti-malware (sometimes also called antivirus) programs block and remove some or all types of malware. For example, Microsoft Security Essentials (for Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7) and Windows Defender (for Windows 8, 10 and 11) provide real-time protection. The Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool removes malicious software from the system. Additionally, several capable antivirus software programs are available for free download from the Internet (usually restricted to non-commercial use). Tests found some free programs to be competitive with commercial ones.

Typically, antivirus software can combat malware in the following ways:
# Real-time protection: They can provide real time protection against the installation of malware software on a computer. This type of malware protection works the same way as that of antivirus protection in that the anti-malware software scans all incoming network data for malware and blocks any threats it comes across.
# Removal: Anti-malware software programs can be used solely for detection and removal of malware software that has already been installed onto a computer. This type of anti-malware software scans the contents of the Windows registry, operating system files, and installed programs on a computer and will provide a list of any threats found, allowing the user to choose which files to delete or keep, or to compare this list to a list of known malware components, removing files that match.
#Sandboxing: Sandboxing confines applications within a controlled environment, restricting their operations and isolating them from other applications on the host while limiting access to system resources. Browser sandboxing isolates web processes to prevent malware and exploits, enhancing security.

====Real-time protection====
A specific component of anti-malware software, commonly referred to as an on-access or real-time scanner, hooks deep into the operating system&#x27;s core or kernel and functions in a manner similar to how certain malware itself would attempt to operate, though with the user&#x27;s informed permission for protecting the system. Any time the operating system accesses a file, the on-access scanner checks if the file is infected or not. Typically, when an infected file is found, execution is stopped and the file is quarantined to prevent further damage with the intention to prevent irreversible system damage. Most AVs allow users to override this behaviour. This can have a considerable performance impact on the operating system, though the degree of impact is dependent on how many pages it creates in virtual memory.

====Sandboxing====
Sandboxing is a security model that confines applications within a controlled environment, restricting their operations to authorized &quot;safe&quot; actions and isolating them from other applications on the host. It also limits access to system resources like memory and the file system to maintain isolation.

Browser sandboxing is a security measure that isolates web browser processes and tabs from the operating system to prevent malicious code from exploiting vulnerabilities.
It helps protect against malware, zero-day exploits, and unintentional data leaks by trapping potentially harmful code within the sandbox.
It involves creating separate processes, limiting access to system resources, running web content in isolated processes, monitoring system calls, and memory constraints.
Inter-process communication (IPC) is used for secure communication between processes.
Escaping the sandbox involves targeting vulnerabilities in the sandbox mechanism or the operating system&#x27;s sandboxing features.

While sandboxing is not foolproof, it significantly reduces the attack surface of common threats.
Keeping browsers and operating systems updated is crucial to mitigate vulnerabilities.

===Website security scans===
Website vulnerability scans check the website, detect malware, may note outdated software, and may report known security issues, in order to reduce the risk of the site being compromised.

===Network Segregation===
Structuring a network as a set of smaller networks, and limiting the flow of traffic between them to that known to be legitimate, can hinder the ability of infectious malware to replicate itself across the wider network. Software-defined networking provides techniques to implement such controls.

===&quot;Air gap&quot; isolation or &quot;parallel network&quot;===
As a last resort, computers can be protected from malware, and the risk of infected computers disseminating trusted information can be greatly reduced by imposing an &quot;air gap&quot; (i.e. completely disconnecting them from all other networks) and applying enhanced controls over the entry and exit of software and data from the outside world. However, malware can still cross the air gap in some situations, not least due to the need to introduce software into the air-gapped network and can damage the availability or integrity of assets thereon. Stuxnet is an example of malware that is introduced to the target environment via a USB drive, causing damage to processes supported on the environment without the need to exfiltrate data.

AirHopper, BitWhisper, GSMem and Fansmitter are four techniques introduced by researchers that can leak data from air-gapped computers using electromagnetic, thermal and acoustic emissions.

==Research==
Utilizing bibliometric analysis, the study of malware research trends from 2005 to 2015, considering criteria such as impact journals, highly cited articles, research areas, number of publications, keyword frequency, institutions, and authors, revealed an annual growth rate of 34.1%. North America led in research output, followed by Asia and Europe. China and India were identified as emerging contributors.

<doc id="20905" wikidata="Q379709" url="?curid=20905" title="Muttiah Muralitharan">
<text>Deshabandu Muttiah Muralitharan (born 1972) is a Sri Lankan cricket coach, businessman and former professional cricketer. Averaging over six wickets per Test match, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. He is the only bowler to take 800 Test wickets and more than 530 One Day International (ODI) wickets. , he has taken more wickets in international cricket than any other bowler. Muralitharan was a part of the Sri Lankan team that won the 1996 Cricket World Cup. 

Muralitharan&#x27;s international career was beset by controversy over his bowling action. Due to an unusual hyperextension of his congenitally bent arm during delivery, his bowling action was called into question on a number of occasions by umpires and sections of the cricket community. After biomechanical analysis under simulated playing conditions, Muralitharan&#x27;s action was cleared by the International Cricket Council, first in 1996 and again in 1999.

Muralitharan held the number one spot in the International Cricket Council&#x27;s player rankings for Test bowlers for a record period of 1,711 days spanning 214 Test matches. He became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket when he overtook the previous record-holder Shane Warne on 2007. Muralitharan had previously held the record when he surpassed Courtney Walsh&#x27;s 519 wickets in 2004, but he suffered a shoulder injury later that year and was overtaken by Warne. Muralitharan took the wicket of Gautam Gambhir on 5 February 2009 in Colombo to surpass Wasim Akram&#x27;s ODI record of 502 wickets. He retired from Test cricket in 2010, registering his 800th and final wicket on 22 July 2010 from his final ball in his last Test match.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-12/13/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Muralitharan was rated the greatest Test match bowler by &quot;Wisden&#x27;s Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; in 2002, and in 2017 was the first Sri Lankan cricketer to be inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He won the Ada Derana Sri Lankan of the Year award in 2017.

==Early years and personal life==
Muralitharan was born 17 April 1972 to a Hill Country Tamil Hindu family in Kandy, Sri Lanka, the eldest of the four sons to Sinnasamy Muttiah and Lakshmi. Muralitharan&#x27;s father, Sinnasamy Muttiah, runs a successful biscuit-making business. Muralitharan&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Periyasamy Sinasamy, came from South India to work in the tea plantations of central Sri Lanka in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph, UK,-09/12/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sinasamy later returned to the country of his birth with his daughters and settled in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India. However, his sons, including Muralitharan&#x27;s father Muttiah, remained in Sri Lanka.

When he was nine years old, Muralitharan was sent to St. Anthony&#x27;s College, Kandy, a private school run by Benedictine monks. He began his cricketing career as a medium pace bowler but on the advice of his school coach, Sunil Fernando, he took up off-spin when he was fourteen years old. He soon impressed and went on to play for four years in the school First XI. In those days he played as an all-rounder and batted in the middle order. In his final two seasons at St Anthony&#x27;s College he took over one hundred wickets and in 1990–91 was named as the &#x27;Bata Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year&#x27;.

After leaving school he joined Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club and was selected for the Sri Lanka A tour of England in 1991. He played in five games but failed to capture a single wicket. On his return to Sri Lanka he impressed against Allan Border&#x27;s Australian team in a practice game and then went on to make his Test debut at R. Premadasa Stadium in the Second Test match of the series.

When his grandfather died at the age of 104 in July 2004, Muralitharan returned home from Asia Cup to attend his funeral. Periyasamy Sinasamy&#x27;s first wish to see Muralitharan claiming the world record for the most Test wickets was realised (passing the record set by Courtney Walsh), but not his desire to live to see his grandson married. Muralitharan&#x27;s grandmother had died one month earlier at the age of 97. Muralitharan&#x27;s manager, Kushil Gunasekera, stated that &quot;Murali&#x27;s family is closely knit and united. They respect traditional values. The late grandfather enjoyed a great relationship with Murali.&quot;

Muralitharan married Madhimalar Ramamurthy, a Chennai native, on 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune-2/3/05&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Madhimalar is the daughter of the late Dr S. Ramamurthy of Malar Hospitals, and his wife Dr Nithya Ramamurthy. Their first child, Naren, was born in January 2006.

Muttiah Muralitharan holds Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) and he does not need a visa for travelling to India. According to his manager, Kushil Gunasekera, Muralitharan qualifies for this status because his family originates from India. Muttiah announced on 3 April 2011 that he was retiring from all sport.

==Spelling and meaning of name==
Even though his name was widely romanised as Muralitharan from the start of his career, he prefers the spelling Muralidaran. The different spellings have arisen because the Tamil letter த can be pronounced as both &#x27;t&#x27; and &#x27;d&#x27; depending on its place in a word. It is often transliterated as &#x27;th&#x27; to distinguish it from another letter, ட, which is a retroflex &#x27;t&#x27; or &#x27;d&#x27;. In 2007, when Cricket Australia decided to unveil the new Warne-Muralidaran Trophy, to be contested between Australia and Sri Lanka, Muralitharan was requested to clarify how his name should be spelt. Cricket Australia spokesman Peter Young confirmed that &quot;the spelling he&#x27;s given is Muralidaran&quot;.

The first-day cover involving Muralitharan bears an official seal captioned as &quot;The highest wicket taker in Test cricket, MUTHIAH MURALIDARAN, First Day of Issue 03.12.2007, Camp Post Office, Asgiriya International Cricket Stadium, Kandy&quot;.

==Domestic cricket==
===In Sri Lanka===
In domestic cricket, Muralitharan played for two first-class Sri Lankan sides, Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club in the Premier Trophy and Central Province in the Provincial Championship. His record is exceptional – 234 wickets at 14.51 runs in 46 matches.

===In England===
He also played county cricket in England, mainly for Lancashire (1999, 2001, 2005 and 2007), appearing in twenty-eight first-class games for the club. He played five first class games for Kent during the 2003 season. His bowling record in English domestic cricket is also exceptional – 236 wickets at 15.62 runs in 33 matches. Despite his efforts, he was never on a title-winning first-class domestic team in either the Premier Trophy or the County Championship. He was unusual amongst his contemporaries in that he played in more Test matches than other first-class games (116 Tests and 99 other first-class matches as of 2007). Muralitharan was signed by Gloucestershire in 2011 to play in T20 matches. He renewed his T20 contract with Gloucestershire in 2012, but did not stay on for the 2013 season.

===In India===
Muralitharan was contracted to represent Bengal in the 2008–09 Ranji Trophy tournament. He was expected to play about four matches in the tournament&#x27;s second division – the Plate League.

In February 2008, Muralitharan was slated to play Twenty20 cricket for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He was bought for $600,000 by India Cements, the Chennai franchisee of the IPL, through a bidding process. The Chennai Super Kings were the runners-up in the inaugural edition of the IPL, losing to the Rajasthan Royals in the final. Muralitharan captured 11 wickets in 15 games, at an economy rate of 6.96 an over. In 2010, in the third season of IPL, Muralitharan was part of the Chennai Super Kings side that won the IPL championship. Muralitharan also remained the side&#x27;s leading wicket-taker after all the three tournaments.

At the 2011 IPL Player Auction Muralitharan was bought by Kochi Tuskers Kerala for US$1.1 million.

In the 2012 season Muralitharan moved to Royal Challengers Bangalore, where he took 14 wickets in 9 games and had an average economy rate of 6.38. He played for Royal Challengers Bangalore from 2012 to 2014. He decided to retire from the IPL in 2014.

In 2015, Muralitharan was appointed as the bowling coach and mentor of the IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad.

===In Australia===
Muttiah Muralitharan signed for the Melbourne Renegades to play Twenty20 cricket in the Big Bash League in 2012. He stated, &quot;I wanted to play one season in Australia and the opportunity from the Melbourne Renegades was there so I took it with both hands.&quot;

==International career==
===Bowling style and career progress===
Muralitharan is the first wrist-spinning off-spinner in the history of the game.
He bowls marathon spells, yet he is usually on the attack. His unique bowling action begins with a short run-up, and culminates with an open-chested extremely wristy release from a partly supinated forearm which had him mistaken for a leg-spinner early in his career by Allan Border. Aside from his stock delivery, the off-break, of which he claimed to have two variations (during a recorded television &#x27;doosra&#x27; show off with Mark Nicholas from Channel 4 in 2004), his main deliveries are a fast topspinner which lands on the seam and usually goes straight on, and the doosra, a surprise delivery which turns from leg to off (the opposite direction of his stock delivery) with no easily discernible change of action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muttiah Muralitharan - Legend / The Genius&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he would occasionally use one of his several unnamed novelties. His super-flexible wrist makes him especially potent and guarantees him turn on any surface.

From his debut in 1992, Muralitharan took 800 Test wickets and over 500 One Day International wickets, becoming the first player to take 1,000 wickets combined in the two main forms of international cricket.

===Test cricket===
====Emerging years====
On 28 August 1992 at the age of 20, Muralitharan made his debut against Australia at the Khettarama Stadium and claimed 3 for 141. Craig McDermott was his first Test wicket.

In August 1993 at Moratuwa, Muralitharan captured 5 for 104 in South Africa&#x27;s first innings, his first five-wicket haul in Tests. His wickets included Kepler Wessels, Hansie Cronje and Jonty Rhodes.

Prior to the eventful Boxing Day Test of 1995, Muralitharan had captured 80 wickets in 22 Tests at an unflattering average of 32.74. Even at that point in his career he was the leading wicket taker for Sri Lanka having gone past Rumesh Ratnayake&#x27;s aggregate of 73 wickets.

====Boxing Day Test 1995====
During the second Test between Sri Lanka and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Boxing Day 1995, Australian umpire Darrell Hair called Muralitharan for throwing in front of a crowd of 55,239. The off-spinner was no-balled seven times in three overs by Hair, who believed the then 23-year-old was bending his arm and straightening it in the process of delivery; an illegal action in cricket.

Muralitharan had bowled two overs before lunch from umpire Steve Dunne&#x27;s or the Members&#x27; End of the ground with umpire Hair at square leg and these passed without incident. At he took up the attack from umpire Hair&#x27;s or the southern end. Muralitharan&#x27;s third over was a maiden with all deliveries again passed as legitimate but in his fourth Hair no-balled him twice for throwing on the fourth and sixth balls. The umpire continued to call him three times in his fifth over on the second, fourth and sixth balls. While the bowler stood with his hands on his hips perplexed, the five calls provoked an immediate response by the Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga who left the field at to take advice from his team management. He returned at and continued with Muralitharan who was called two more times in his sixth over on the second and sixth balls. At Ranatunga removed the bowler from the attack, although he reintroduced him at at umpire Dunne&#x27;s end. Although Hair reports in his book, &quot;Decision Maker&quot;, that at the end of the tea break he stated that he would call Muralitharan no matter which end he bowled he did not do so. Muralitharan completed another twelve overs without further no-balls and, after bowling Mark Waugh, finished the day with figures of 18–3–58–1.

After being no-balled Muralitharan bowled a further 32 overs from umpire Steve Dunne&#x27;s end without protest from either Dunne or Hair, at square leg. The Sri Lankan camp was outraged after the incident, but the ICC defended Hair, outlining a list of steps they had taken in the past to determine, without result, the legitimacy of Muralitharan&#x27;s action. By calling Muralitharan from the bowlers&#x27; end Hair overrode what is normally regarded as the authority of the square leg umpire in adjudicating on throwing. Dunne would have had to break convention to support his partner.

At the end of the match the Sri Lankans requested from the ICC permission to confer with Hair to find out exactly how to remedy the problem with their bowler. Despite the game&#x27;s controlling body agreeing to it, the Australian Cricket Board vetoed it on the grounds that it might lead to umpires being quizzed by teams after every game and meant that the throwing controversy would continue into the World Series Cup during the coming week. The Sri Lankans were disappointed they did not get an explanation and decided they would continue playing their bowler in matches not umpired by Hair and wanted to know whether other umpires would support or reject Hair&#x27;s judgement.

Muralitharan&#x27;s action was cleared by the ICC after biomechanical analysis at the University of Western Australia and at the Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology in 1996. They concluded that his action created the &#x27;optical illusion of throwing&#x27;.

====Mid career====
On 16 March 1997, Muralitharan became the first Sri Lankan to reach 100 test wickets, when he dismissed Stephen Fleming in the second innings of the Hamilton Test.

In January 1998, Muralitharan took his first ten-wicket haul against Zimbabwe in the first test at Kandy. Sri Lanka won by eight wickets and Muralitharan had figures of 12 for 117.

In August that same year Muralitharan produces his career-best test match figures of 16 for 220, in the one-off test against England. In England&#x27;s second innings Muralitharan bowled a marathon 54.2 overs to pick up 9 for 65 runs, the other wicket being a run out. Ben Hollioake becomes his 200th test wicket. Sri Lanka won by ten wickets, their first Test victory in England. After breaking the world record for the most test wickets in 2007, Muralitharan commented that his 1998 performance at the Oval against England, was his career highlight. He stated &quot;Everyone thought I was a good bowler then and I didn&#x27;t look back from there.&quot;

Playing his 58th test, Muralitharan claimed his 300th test wicket when he dismissed Shaun Pollock in the First Test in Durban, in December 2000. Only Dennis Lillee reached the milestone faster, in his 56th test.

On 4 January 2002 in Kandy Muralitharan might have finished with the best-ever figures for a single innings, but after he had claimed nine wickets against Zimbabwe Russel Arnold dropped a catch at short leg.
He missed out on the tenth when Chaminda Vaas dismissed Henry Olonga caught behind amid stifled appeals. Muralitharan follows up his 9 for 51 in the first innings with 4 for 64 in the second, equalling Richard Hadlee&#x27;s record of 10 ten-wicket match hauls, but needing 15 fewer Tests to do so.

On 15 January 2002 playing in his 72nd test, Muralitharan became the fastest and youngest to reach the 400-wicket landmark when he bowled Olonga in the third Test in Galle.

On 16 March 2004 Muralitharan became the fastest and the youngest bowler to reach 500 wickets during the second test between Sri Lanka and Australia played in Kandy. In his 87th test, he bowled Kasprowicz to claim his 500th victim just four days after Warne reached the landmark on the fifth day of the First Test between the two teams at Galle. Warne took 108 tests to reach 500. Muralitharan took 4–48 on the first day of the second Test as Australia were skittled for 120 in the first innings.

====Passing Walsh and Warne====
In May 2004, Muralitharan overtook West Indian Courtney Walsh&#x27;s record of 519 Test match wickets to become the highest wicket-taker. Zimbabwe&#x27;s Mluleki Nkala becomes Muralitharan&#x27;s 520th scalp in Tests. Muralitharan held the record until Shane Warne claimed it in October 2004. Warne surpassed Muralitharan&#x27;s mark of 532 wickets by dismissing India&#x27;s Irfan Pathan. Warne said he enjoyed his duel with Muralitharan, who was sidelined following shoulder surgery at the time.

After an outstanding year Muralitharan was adjudged as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2006. In six Tests, he took 60 wickets. He took ten in each of four successive matches, the second time he performed such a feat. The opponents for his 60-wicket haul were England away, South Africa at home and New Zealand away: serious opposition. In all, Muralitharan took 90 wickets in 11 Tests in the calendar year.
 For his performances in 2006, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC and ESPNcricinfo.

In July 2007, Muttiah Muralitharan became the second bowler after Warne to capture 700 Test wickets. The off-spinner reached the landmark when he had Bangladesh&#x27;s last man Syed Rasel caught in the deep by Farveez Maharoof on the fourth day of the third and final Test at the Asgiriya stadium in Kandy. The dismissal signalled Sri Lanka&#x27;s victory by an innings and 193 runs to give the host a 3–0 sweep of the series. Muralitharan finished with six wickets in each innings to claim 10 wickets or more in a Test for the 20th time. However, he was unable to pass Warne&#x27;s record of 708 wickets when Sri Lanka toured Australia in November 2007, capturing just four wickets in two Test matches.

Muralitharan reclaimed the record for most Test wickets during the first Test against England at Kandy on 2007. The spinner bowled England&#x27;s Paul Collingwood to claim his 709th Test victim and overtaking Shane Warne in the process. Muralitharan reached the mark in his 116th Test – 29 fewer than Warne – and had conceded only 21.77 runs per wicket compared to the Australian&#x27;s 25.41. This was Muralitharan&#x27;s 61st 5-wicket haul. Warne believed that Muralitharan would take &quot;1,000 wickets&quot; before he retired. Former record holder Courtney Walsh also opined that this would be possible if Muralitharan retained his hunger for wickets. Muralitharan himself believed there was a possibility that he would reach this milestone. For his performances in 2007, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC and ESPNcricinfo.

====Beyond the world record====
In July 2008, Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis stopped India&#x27;s strong batting as Sri Lanka won the first Test by a record innings and 239 runs in Colombo. Muralitharan finished the match with 11 wickets for 110, as India were shot out for 138 in their second innings after conceding a lead of 377 on the fourth day. He was well supported by debutant Ajantha Mendis, an unorthodox spinner with plenty of variation, who took eight wickets in his debut match.

Muralitharan believed the emergence of Mendis would help prolong his own career. Muralitharan, 36, and 23-year-old Mendis formed a formidable partnership in the first Test thrashing of India, taking 19 of the 20 wickets between them. &quot;If he keeps performing this way, he will definitely take a lot of wickets in international cricket. Now that he has come, I think I can play Test cricket a few more years. Bowling 50 overs in a Test innings is very hard. Now if I bowl only 30–35 and he bowls more than me, the job will get easier for me.&quot;

For his performances in 2008, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC.

====Performance analysis====
In July 2007, Muralitharan achieved a career peak Test Bowling Rating of 920, based on the LG ICC Player Rankings. This is the highest ever rating achieved by a spin bowler in Test cricket. This also puts him in fourth place in the LG ICC Best-Ever Test bowling ratings.

Muralitharan has the unique distinction of getting 10 or more wickets in a match against all other nine Test playing nations as well as capturing over 50 wickets against each of them. He also obtained 7 or more wickets in an innings against five nations, namely England, India, South Africa, West Indies and Zimbabwe (refer to table above). Muttiah Muralitharan also took at least five five-fors against all the other nine Test sides.

He currently holds the highest wickets/match ratio (6.1) for any bowler with over 200 Test wickets and also represented Sri Lanka in 118 Tests of the 175 that they have played (67.4%).

Against teams excluding Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, Muralitharan took 624 wickets in 108 Tests. By comparison, excluding his matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, Warne took 691 wickets in 142 tests. Murali&#x27;s average of 24.05 is slightly superior to Warne&#x27;s career average of 25.41. Muralitharan won 18 Man of the Match awards in Test cricket.

During Muralitharan&#x27;s playing days, the ICC Future Tours Programme denied Sri Lanka and several other teams a level playing field. As a consequence Muralitharan never toured South Africa after December 2002 and never playing a Test at the spin-friendly Sydney Cricket Ground.

Another comparison of Muralitharan&#x27;s bowling record against other successful international bowlers is their career record away from home. Muralitharan received criticism that he enjoyed great success on home soil, taking wickets on pitches that are more spin-friendly than other international pitches. A quick analysis of his Test record of matches played outside Sri Lanka shows that from 52 matches he took 278 wickets at an average of 26.24 runs per wicket, with a strike rate of 60.1 balls per wicket. Similarly, spin bowling rival Shane Warne retired with a slightly superior &#x27;away&#x27; record of 362 wickets from 73 matches, at an average of 25.50 and a strike rate of 56.7. Due to the variabilities of Test cricket such as grounds played at and opposition played against it is difficult to compare the quality of the top level players and, as such, is very difficult and subjective. However, it is clear that Muralitharan did much better playing at home to test minnows Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, averaging less than 16 runs a wicket.

Cricinfo&#x27;s statistics editor S Rajesh concluded that the decade 2000–2009 was the best 10-year period for Test batsmen since the 1940s. Muralitharan was clearly the leading Test wicket-taker during this period, capturing 565 wickets at 20.97 in spite of the dominance of the bat over ball. Shane Warne captured 357 wickets at an average of 25.17 during the decade. Of spinners with over Test 100 wickets only John Briggs (17.75), Jim Laker (21.24), Bill O&#x27;Reilly (22.59) and Clarrie Grimmett (24.21) have sub 25.00 bowling averages.

Muralitharan was on the winning side on 54 of the 133 test matches he played. In those games he captured a total of 438 wickets (8.1 wickets per match), at an outstanding average of 16.18 per wicket and a strike rate of 42.7.
Muralitharan took 795 wickets for his country Sri Lanka in 132 tests. The next most wickets for Sri Lanka in these 132 Tests was Chaminda Vaas&#x27; 309 – less than 40% of the spinner&#x27;s pile. No one else managed 100. Collectively Sri Lankan bowlers tallied 1968 wickets across that span, of which Muralitharan accounted for 40.4%. Among the 24 other Sri Lankans who took more than 10 of those wickets, only Lasith Malinga did so at a better strike rate (52.3) than Muralitharan&#x27;s 54.9 – and the latter bowled rather more overs, 6657.1 of them to be precise.

====Test wicket milestones====
===One day internationals===
====Career summary====
On 12 August 1993 Muralitharan made his One Day International (ODI) debut against India at the Khettarama Stadium and took 1 for 38 off ten overs. Pravin Amre was his first ODI wicket.

On 27 October 2000 in Sharjah, Muralitharan captured 7 for 30 against India, which were then the best bowling figures in One Day Internationals.

On 9 April 2002 Muralitharan achieved a career peak ODI Bowling Rating of 913, based on the LG ICC Player Rankings. This is the highest ever rating achieved by a spin bowler in One Day Internationals. This also puts him in fourth place in the LG ICC Best-Ever ODI bowling ratings.

In 2006, Muralitharan had the second (now third) highest number of runs (99) hit off him in a One Day International Innings. The Australians, especially Adam Gilchrist, attacked Muralitharan&#x27;s bowling more than usual that day. Yet, for his performances in 2006, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC. Muralitharan does not have a great record against the Australians in ODIs and this was proved again as he was ineffective in the finals of the 2007 World Cup; his chief tormentor again being Gilchrist. Yet, for his performances in 2007, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC. He was named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo for the 2007 World Cup.

Muralitharan played in five Cricket World Cup tournaments, in 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2011. He captured 67 World Cup wickets and is second in the list behind Glenn McGrath who has 71, and represented Sri Lanka in three World Cup finals. In 1996 Muralitharan was part of Sri Lanka&#x27;s World Cup winning team that defeated Australia in Lahore, Pakistan. Muralitharan also played in the 2007 World Cup final, when Australia defeated Sri Lanka in Bridgetown, Barbados. He picked up 23 wickets in the 2007 World Cup, and finished as the second highest wicket taker in the tournament behind Glenn McGrath. He was part of the 2011 team who lost the world cup final against India in Mumbai. It was his farewell match as well. He was named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; for the 2011 World Cup by the ICC.

Muttiah Muralitharan was left out of the Sri Lankan one-day squad to tour West Indies in April 2008. The chairman of selectors Ashantha De Mel clarifying the non-selection stated that &quot;We know he (Muralitharan) can still play in the next World Cup if he is properly looked after, so we want to use him sparingly to preserve him for the big games and the World Cup coming up in the Asian sub-continent where Muralitharan will be a threat.&quot;

Muralitharan has the highest number of career wickets in One Day Internationals, having overtaken Wasim Akram on 2009. Akram took 502 wickets in 356 matches. On 2009, Muralitharan dismissed Yuvraj Singh in his 327th match, the third ODI against India in Colombo to equal Akram&#x27;s record. He won 13 Man of the Match awards in this form of the game.

===Batting===
An aggressive lower order batsman who usually batted at No. 11, Muralitharan was known for his tendency to back away to leg and slog. Sometimes, he could be troublesome for bowlers because of his unorthodox and adventurous ways. Once, in a Test match against England, while playing Alex Tudor, he moved back towards his leg stump trying to hook the ball and ended up lying on the ground sideways after the shot. He was infamously run out in a match against New Zealand when he left his crease to congratulate Kumar Sangakkara, who had just scored a single to reach his century; the New Zealand fielder had not yet returned the ball to the wicketkeeper, so the ball was still in play. His highest Test score of 67 came against India at Kandy in 2001, including three sixes and five fours. He made valuable scores on occasion, including 30 runs against England at the Oval in 1998, including 5 fours, 38 runs (4 fours, 1 six) against England at Galle in 2003, 43 runs (5 fours, 3 sixes) against Australia at Kandy in 2004 36 runs against the West Indies at Colombo in 2005, and his highest-ever ODI score, 33 not out (4 fours and 2 sixes off 16 balls) against Bangladesh in the final of the 2009 Tri-Series in Bangladesh. In the latter match, Muralitharan&#x27;s effort, which included three fours and a six off one over, played a key role in Sri Lanka winning the match and series after the first eight overs saw them reduced to 6 for 5, the lowest score ever recorded in an ODI at the fall of the fifth wicket. Muralitharan has a strike rate close to 70 in Test cricket and scored over 55% of his Test runs in fours and sixes.

Muralitharan, together with Chaminda Vaas, holds the record for the highest 10th wicket partnership in Tests for Sri Lanka. The pair put on 79 runs for the last wicket at the Asgiriya Stadium against Australia in March 2004. Muralitharan also holds the record for scoring most runs in Test cricket while batting at the number 11 position.

Muralitharan currently holds the record for the most ducks (dismissals for zero) ever in international cricket (Tests, ODI&#x27;s and Twenty20), with a total of 59 ducks.

===Abuse in Australia===
Muralitharan voiced his frustration at routinely being heckled by Australian crowds who accused him of throwing – one common jeer directed at him was &quot;No Ball!&quot;. Following the then Australian Prime Minister John Howard&#x27;s statement that Muralitharan was a &quot;chucker&quot;, in 2004, Muralitharan indicated that he would skip future tours to Australia.

Tom Moody, the former Sri Lanka coach and former Australian Test cricketer, said he was embarrassed by the derogatory reaction and negative attention directed towards Muttiah Muralitharan by Australian crowds. Moody stated that &quot;As an Australian when I have been with the Sri Lankan team in Australia, or playing against them in the World Cup, it&#x27;s the only situation we find in the whole of the cricketing world where we have this disgraceful slant on a cricketer&quot;.

During the 2008 Commonwealth Bank series in Australia, some members of the Sri Lankan contingent including Muralitharan, were the target of an egg throwing incident in Hobart. The Sri Lankan cricket selector Don Anurasiri was hit by an egg, while Muralitharan and two others were verbally abused by a car-load of people as they were walking from a restaurant back to the hotel. Due to the incident taking place at night, it is unclear whether Muralitharan was indeed the target of the culprits. Even though the Australian coach of the Sri Lankan team, Trevor Bayliss, down-played the incident as &quot;a non-event&quot;, Cricket Australia tightened security around the team. In response to this episode Muralitharan was quoted as saying &quot;When you come to Australia, you expect such incidents&quot;.

At the conclusion of Muralitharan&#x27;s test career cricket writer Rahul Bhattacharya summed up Muralitharan&#x27;s trials thus:
&quot;Murali is described often as a fox. This seems right. Unlike hedgehog bowlers who pursue one big idea, Murali, like a fox, had many ways of pursuit. Like a fox he did not hunt in a pack. Like a fox he was himself cruelly hunted for sport in some parts of the world. Fox hunting was banned a few years ago in England, but is still legal in Australia.&quot;

===Retirement===
On 7 July 2010, Muttiah Muralitharan formally announced his retirement from Test cricket at a media briefing in Colombo. He confirmed that the first Test Match against India due to commence on , 2010 would be his last, but indicated that he was willing to play One-Day Internationals if it was considered necessary leading up to the 2011 World Cup, which Sri Lanka co-hosted. He identified Sri Lanka&#x27;s World Cup win of 1996 as his greatest moment as a cricketer. He also stated that there were some regrets during his 19-year playing career. &quot;Not winning Test matches in South Africa, Australia and India are regrets. But I am sure we will win very soon.&quot;

At the start of his last match, Muralitharan was eight short of 800 wickets. At the fall of the ninth wicket of the Indian&#x27;s second innings Muralitharan still needed one wicket to reach the milestone. After 90 minutes of resistance Muralitharan was able to dismiss the last Indian batsman Pragyan Ojha on the last delivery of the final over of his Test career. By doing so he became the only bowler to reach 800 wickets in Test cricket. Sri Lanka won the match by 10 wickets, the seventh time they have done so and the second time they have done it against India.

In late 2010, Muralitharan announced his retirement from international cricket after 2011 Cricket World Cup, co-hosted by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka announcing &quot;This World Cup will be my last outing. I am retiring totally from international cricket thereafter. My time is up. I&#x27;ve signed up to play for two years in IPL.&quot; His final ODI appearance in Sri Lankan soil came during the semi-final clash against New Zealand, where Muralitharan took the wicket of Scott Styris in his last delivery. His last ODI was against India in the World Cup final at Mumbai, however Sri Lanka lost the match and Murali couldn&#x27;t take any wickets.

==After retirement==
In July 2014, he played for the Rest of the World side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord&#x27;s.

==Coaching career==
Muralitharan is the bowling coach of Sunrisers Hyderabad since 2015. Under in his tenure the Sunrisers Hyderabad emerged as IPL Champions in 2016. He has also been appointed as the head coach of Thiruvallur Veerans in the 2nd edition of the TNPL.

In 2014, Muralitharan joined the Australian national team as a coaching consultant for the Test series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates. On 11 March 2014, he was appointed as the spin bowling consultant for the Cricket Association of Bengal. The tenure started with the players in a four-day camp beginning on 15 March 2014.

He was again called up for the Australian team prior to Australia&#x27;s tour of Sri Lanka in 2016. Despite his presence in the team as consultant, Australia failed to win any of the three Test matches, losing the series 3–0. Muralitharan&#x27;s role in the Australian team generated controversy throughout the country and Sri Lanka Cricket, and Muralitharan traded verbal blows with the then Sri Lanka team manager Charith Senanayake following an altercation. The Head of SLC Thilanga Sumathipala warned Muralitharan for attempting to coach the Australian team, the team which gave more pressure to Muralitharan in the past due to his bowling actions. Muralitharan said that the team which was against him in the past but now called him to coach them to play against Sri Lanka was a big victory in his career.

==World records and achievements==

Muttiah Muralitharan holds a number of world records, and several firsts:
* The most Test wickets (800 wickets)

==Recognition==
In 2002, Wisden carried out a statistical analysis of all Test matches in an effort to rate the greatest cricketers in history, and Muralitharan was ranked as the best Test bowler of all time. However, two years earlier, Muralitharan was not named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Century. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh called him &quot;the Don Bradman of bowling&quot;.

Muralitharan was selected as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2000 and in 2006.

On 15 November 2007, the Warne-Muralidaran Trophy was unveiled named after the two leading wicket-takers in Test cricket, Shane Warne and Muralitharan. The trophy displays images of the two spin bowlers&#x27; hands each holding a cricket ball. This trophy will be contested between Australia and Sri Lanka in all future Test series.

On 3 December 2007, just hours after Muttiah Muralitharan became Test cricket&#x27;s leading Test wicket-taker, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) announced it had unveiled a portrait of the Sri Lanka off-spinner at Lord&#x27;s. On the same day the Philatelic Bureau of the Department of Posts in Sri Lanka issued a circular stamp with a denomination of Rs. 5 to mark the world record set by Muttiah Muralitharan. The circular design was meant to denote the cricket ball.

Australian musician Alston Koch provoked worldwide interest when he recorded the only official tribute song to Muralitharan. The song was even mentioned on the BBC&#x27;s Test Match Special. The Muralitharan Song video was also released after he broke the world record.

On 10 January 2008, the Parliament of Sri Lanka felicitated Muttiah Muralitharan for his world record breaking feat of being the highest wicket taker in Test cricket.
This was the first time that a sportsman had been honoured in the country&#x27;s Supreme Legislature.

The Central Provincial Council in Kandy has renamed the International Cricket Stadium in Pallekele after Muttiah Muralitharan.

==Controversy of bowling action==
Throughout much of his international career, Muralitharan&#x27;s action was suspected of contravening the laws of the game by the straightening of his bowling arm during delivery. Although he was cited three times, subsequent biomechanical testing led the ICC to clear him of the charge and permit him to continue bowling.

Biomechanical testing conducted on four occasions fueled debate as to whether his action was in fact illegal or actually an illusion created by his allegedly unique ability to generate extra movement both at the shoulder as well the wrist, which enables him to bowl the doosra without straightening the elbow.

===First throwing citation and testing===

Initial concerns as to whether Muralitharan&#x27;s action contravened the laws of the game by straightening his bowling arm during delivery broke into open controversy after Australian umpire Darrell Hair called a &quot;no-ball&quot; for an illegal action seven times during the Boxing Day Test match in Melbourne, Australia, in 1995. Australian Sir Donald Bradman, universally regarded as the greatest batsman in history, was later quoted as saying it was the &quot;worst example of umpiring that [he had] witnessed, and against everything the game stands for. Clearly Murali does not throw the ball&quot;.

Ten days later, on 5 January 1996, Sri Lanka played the West Indies in the seventh ODI of the triangular World Series competition, in Brisbane. Umpire Ross Emerson officiating in his debut international match, no-balled Muralitharan three times in his first over, twice in his second and twice in his third. It was an identical tally to that called by Hair on Boxing Day and (like Hair) Emerson made his calls from the bowler&#x27;s end while his partner stood silent. The main difference was that several no-balls were for leg-breaks instead of the bowler&#x27;s normal off-breaks.

In February 1996, just before the World Cup, Muralitharan underwent biomechanical analysis at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Ravindra Goonetilleke, who declared his action legal in the conditions tested, citing a congenital defect in Muralitharan&#x27;s arm which makes him incapable of fully straightening the arm but gives the appearance of fully straightening it. Although under the original Laws a bowler&#x27;s arm did not have to be fully straightened to be an illegal delivery, it was concluded that his action created the &#x27;optical illusion of throwing&#x27;. Based on this evidence, ICC gave clearance to Muralitharan to continue bowling.

===Second citation and testing===
Doubts about Muralitharan&#x27;s action persisted, however. On the 1998–99 tour to Australia he was once again called for throwing by Ross Emerson during a One Day International against England at the Adelaide Oval in Australia. The Sri Lankan team almost abandoned the match, but after instructions from the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka, the game resumed. The Sri Lankan captain at the time Arjuna Ranatunga, was later fined and given a suspended ban from the game as a result. It later emerged that at the time of this match Emerson was on sick leave from his non-cricket job due to a stress-related illness and he stood down for the rest of the series. Muralitharan was sent for further tests in Perth and England and was cleared again. At no stage was Muralitharan requested to change or remodel his action, by the ICC. Up to this point in his career (1999) Muralitharan primarily bowled two types of deliveries, namely the off-break and the topspinner. He had not yet mastered the doosra.

===Third citation and testing===
Muralitharan continued bowling, taking his 500th Test wicket in the second Test against Australia in Kandy on 2004. At the end of the series his doosra delivery was officially called into question by match referee Chris Broad. At the University of Western Australia (Department of Human Movement and Exercise Science), three-dimensional kinematic measurements of Muttiah Muralitharan&#x27;s bowling arm were taken using an optical motion capture system while he bowled his doosra. Muralitharan&#x27;s mean elbow extension angle for the doosra delivery was 14°, which was subsequently reduced to a mean of 10.2° after remedial training at the university. The findings reported to ICC by the University of Western Australia&#x27;s study was that Muralitharan&#x27;s doosra contravened the established ICC elbow extension limit of 5° for spinners.

Under the original throwing Laws of Cricket, the umpires officiating were under an obligation to call &quot;no-ball&quot; to a delivery that they were not entirely happy was absolutely fair. This Law gave the umpires absolutely no discretion. In 2000, the Laws were changed to put an allowable figure of straightening of 5° for spinners, 7.5° for medium pacers and 10° for fast bowlers in an attempt to more clearly define what was legal. But these figures proved difficult to enforce due to umpires being unable to discern actual amounts of straightening and the differentiation between the three different allowable figures. Testing in Test match conditions is not currently possible &quot;when the identification of elbow and shoulder joint centres in on-field data collection, where a shirt is worn, also involves large errors. In a match the ability to differentiate anatomical movements such as &#x27;elbow extension&#x27; by digitising segment end-points, particularly if you have segment rotations, is extremely difficult and prone to error. This is certainly the case with spin bowlers. It is therefore not surprising that laboratory testing is preferred, particularly for spin bowlers, where an appropriate pitch length and run-up can be structured. This is clearly the only way to test players, where data would be able to withstand scientific and therefore legal scrutiny.&quot;

An extensive ICC study, the results of which were released in November 2004, was conducted to investigate the &quot;chucking issue&quot;. A laboratory kinematic analysis of 42 non-Test playing bowlers done by Ferdinands and Kersting (2004) established that the 5° limit for slow and spin bowlers was particularly impractical.

Due to the overwhelming scientific findings, researchers recommended that a flat rate of 15° tolerable elbow extension be used to define a preliminary demarcation point between bowling and throwing. A panel of former Test players consisting of Aravinda de Silva, Angus Fraser, Michael Holding, Tony Lewis, Tim May and the ICC&#x27;s Dave Richardson, with the assistance of several biomechanical experts, stated that 99% of all bowlers in the history of cricket straighten their arms when bowling. Only one player tested (part-time bowler Ramnaresh Sarwan) reportedly did not transgress the pre 2000 rules. Many of these reports have controversially not been published and as such, the 99% figure stated has yet to be proved. In fact, Muralitharan stirred up controversy when he said during an interview with a Melbourne radio station that Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee flexed their arms by 12, 13 and 14–15 degrees respectively, although it is unclear as to where Muralitharan quoted these figures from. Muralitharan was censured by the Sri Lankan Cricket Board for these comments.

The ICC Executive was asked to ratify the panel&#x27;s recommendations at the ICC&#x27;s Annual General Meeting in February 2005. Based on the recommendations the ICC issued a new guideline (which was effective from 2005) allowing for extensions or hyperextensions of up to 15 degrees for all types of bowlers, thus deeming Muralitharan&#x27;s doosra to be legal.

Explaining why the maximum level of 15 degrees was arrived at, panel member Angus Fraser stated &quot;That is the number which biomechanics says that it (straightening) becomes visible. It is difficult for the naked eye to see less than 15 degrees in a bowler&#x27;s action. We found when the biceps reached the shoulder the amount of bend was around 165 degrees. Very few bowlers can get to 180 degrees because the joint doesn&#x27;t allow that. ... but once you go further than 15 degrees you get into an area which is starting to give you an unfair advantage and you are breaking the law&quot;.

===University of South Australia study===

The original decision of disallowing the doosra bowling action was hailed widely as justifiable on account of being scientifically based. Hence, a team of Australian scientists representing the University of South Australia conducted an independent research, in line with modern Artificial Intelligence and biomechanics to solve the controversial issue arise from doosra. The University of South Australia&#x27;s study, founded by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama, and contributed by Prof. Ozdemir Gol, Prof. J. Mazumdar, Prof. Tony Worsley and Prof. Lakmi Jain has analyzed the previous studies with close scrutiny since the techniques in their fields of expertise are employed in the course of assessment as the basis for decision-making. The findings based on this scientific study are overwhelming and Dave Richardson, general manager ICC stated that &quot;the ICC is currently reviewing the Law on throwing and the ICC regulations and the study done by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama with UniSA scientists is a valuable source of information in this regard.&quot; The team of Australian scientists including Sri Lankan-born Australian scientist, Prof. Mahinda Pathegama reporting their findings, in line with the Muralitharan test to ICC, has analyzed in-depth various issues, such as Pitfalls in image interpretation when using 2D images for 3D modeling associates compared to the modern techniques in Artificial Intelligence and biomechanics, and Biomechanics assessment for doosra bowling action, etc. Pathegama at al. (2004) further reports on the Disagreement of expression on measurement accuracy in the Murali Report, with the analysis of the Motion tracking system used for the Murali Report, and discussing Cognitive aspects, Evidence of errors in Anthropometric assessment and movement tracking, Lateral inhibition in response tracking, Psycho-physiological aspect on post-assessments, Angular measurement errors, Skin marker induced errors, Geometrics-and physics-based 3D modeling and the Approach to on-field assessment, etc.

The Muralitharan Report produced by the University of Western Australia&#x27;s study has considered the Richards study done in 1999 to evaluate the error margin. University of South Australia&#x27;s study done by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama argued that the Richards study which was presented by the University of Western Australia&#x27;s study has used a rigid aluminium bar that only rotated in the horizontal plane to introduce such error margin. Pathegama&#x27;s report stated that &quot;in view of the system used in the test itself yielding considerable error even with a rigid aluminum bar (an &quot;accuracy level of approximately 4 degrees&quot; as stated in the Murali Report), it stands to reason that the error margin would be considerably larger when tracking skin markers on a spin bowler&#x27;s moving upper limb by this same system&quot;. Sri Lankan born Australian medical doctor Siri Kannangara who also then served as the director of the New South Wales Institute of Sports Medicine, was also present at the forefront in analyzing Muttiah Muralitharan&#x27;s bowling action as part of the University of South Australia case study to determine whether Muralitharan&#x27;s bowling action was genuinely legitimate or if he was chucking the ball in his bowling runup when delivering the ball in his follow-through at the international level.

Vincent Barnes in an interview argues that Bruce Elliott, the UWA professor who is also the ICC biomechanist, had made an interesting discovery in his dealings with finger spinners. &quot;He said he had found that a lot of bowlers from the subcontinent could bowl the doosra legally, but not Caucasian bowlers.&quot;

===Fourth round of testing===
On 2 February 2006, Muralitharan underwent a fourth round of biomechanical testing at the University of Western Australia. There had been criticism that the previous round of tests in July 2004 did not replicate match conditions due to a slower bowling speed in the laboratory tests. The results showed that the average elbow extension while bowling the &#x27;doosra&#x27; delivery was 12.2 degrees, at an average of . The average for his off-break was 12.9 degrees at .

===Bowling with an arm brace===
In July 2004 Muralitharan was filmed in England, bowling with an arm brace on. The film was shown on Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 during the Test against England on 2004.

Initially, Muralitharan bowled three balls – the off-spinner, the top-spinner and the doosra – as he would in a match. Then he bowled the same three balls with a brace that is made from steel bars, which are set into strong resin. This brace has been moulded to his right arm, is approximately 46 centimetres long and weighs just under 1 kilogram.

TV presenter Mark Nicholas who tried the brace himself, confirmed that &quot;There is no way an arm can be bent, or flexed, when it is in this brace.&quot; All three balls reacted in the same way as when bowled without the brace. They were not bowled quite so fast because the weight of the brace restricts the speed of Muralitharan&#x27;s shoulder rotation, but the spin was still there.

With the brace on, there still appeared to be a jerk in his action. When studying the film at varying speeds, it still appeared as if he straightened his arm, even though the brace makes it impossible to do so. His unique shoulder rotation and amazing wrist action seem to create the illusion that he straightens his arm.

The off-spinner said the exercise was to convince a sceptical public rather than sway an ICC investigation into bowling actions launched after he was reported by match referee Chris Broad for his doosra delivery in March 2004, the third time action was taken on his bowling. In an interview for August 2004 edition of Wisden Asia Cricket, Muralitharan stated &quot;I think it will prove a point to those who had said that it was physically impossible to bowl a ball that turned the other way. I proved that it was possible to bowl the doosra without bending the arm.&quot;

In 2004 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Muralitharan voluntarily performed a series of tests with live video cameras. Michael Slater and Ravi Shastri witnessed it all unfold. Muralitharan once again showed he could bowl all his deliveries including the doosra with an arm brace that prevents any straightening of his elbow. Orthopediatrician Dr Mandeep Dillon stated that Muralitharan&#x27;s unusual ability to generate extra movement both at the shoulder as well the wrist enables him to bowl the doosra without straightening the elbow.

===Critics and converts===
Two vocal critics of Muralitharan&#x27;s action have been former test cricketers, Australian Dean Jones and Bishan Bedi, the former Indian captain. Dean Jones later admitted to being wrong in his assessment of Murali when he witnessed first hand Murali bowling with an arm-brace on.

Michael Holding, the former West Indian fast bowler was also a critic of Muralitharan, but withdrew his criticisms under the light of the tests carried out. Holding had been quoted as being in &quot;110% agreement&quot; with Bedi, who likened Murali&#x27;s action to a &quot;javelin throw&quot; and more recently, compared to a &quot;shot putter&quot;. Following the ICC study, as a member of the panel that conducted the study, Holding stated, &quot;The scientific evidence is overwhelming ... When bowlers who to the naked eye look to have pure actions are thoroughly analysed with the sophisticated technology now in place, they are likely to be shown as straightening their arm by 11 and in some cases 12 degrees. Under a strict interpretation of the Law, these players are breaking the rules. The game needs to deal with this reality and make its judgment as to how it accommodates this fact.&quot;

In May 2002, Adam Gilchrist, speaking at a Carlton (Australian) Football Club luncheon, claimed Muralitharan&#x27;s action does not comply with the laws of cricket. The Melbourne-based Age newspaper quoted Gilchrist as saying.&quot;Yeah, I think he does (chuck), and I say that because, if you read the laws of the game, there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that he and many others, throughout cricket history have.&quot; These comments were made before the doosra controversy, in spite of Muralitharan&#x27;s action having been cleared by ICC in both 1996 and 1999. For his comment Gilchrist was reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and found guilty of being in breach of ACB rules concerned with &quot;detrimental public comment&quot;.

During the 2006 tour of New Zealand another Muralitharan critic, former New Zealand captain and cricket commentator Martin Crowe, called for Muralitharan&#x27;s doosra to be monitored more closely, asserting that his action seemed to deteriorate during a match. Earlier that year when delivering the Cowdrey lecture at Lords Martin Crowe had demanded zero tolerance instead of 15 degrees for throwing and specifically branded Muttiah Muralitharan a chucker. In response to Crowe&#x27;s criticism ICC general manager Dave Richardson stated that the scientific evidence presented by biomechanists Professor Bruce Elliot, Dr Paul Hurrion and Mr Marc Portuswith was overwhelming and clarified that &quot;Some bowlers, even those not suspected of having flawed actions, were found likely to be straightening their arms by 11 or 12 degrees. And at the same time, some bowlers that may appear to be throwing may be hyper-extending or bowl with permanently bent elbows. Under a strict interpretation of the law, they were breaking the rules – but if we ruled out every bowler that did that then there would be no bowlers left.&quot;

==Scientific research on bowling actions==
Since 1999 there has been a number of scientific research publications discussing Muralitharan&#x27;s bowling action as well the need for defining the legality of a bowling action using biomechanical concepts. This research directly contributed towards the official acceptance of Muralitharan&#x27;s bowling action and convinced the ICC to redefine the bowling laws in cricket.

==Philanthropy==
Muralitharan, along with his manager Kushil Gunasekara, established the charitable organisation Foundation of Goodness in the early 2000s. The organisation is committed to the wellbeing of the Seenigama region (in southern Sri Lanka) and supports local communities through a range of projects across areas including children&#x27;s needs, education and training, health care and psycho-social support, housing, livelihoods, sport and the environment. Murali&#x27;s Seenigama project raised funds from cricketers and administrators in England and Australia. Canadian pop-star Bryan Adams donated a swimming pool.

Muralitharan also planned to build a second sports complex for war-displaced civilians in Mankulam, a town located 300 kilometres from north of Colombo. The two-year, $1 million dollar project aimed to build a sports centre, a school, English and IT training centres and an Elders&#x27; home. While the Sports Complex remains the main project, Foundation of Goodness also plans to help educate children, youth and adults. English cricketer Sir Ian Botham visited Mankulam with Muralitharan, and later addressing the media in Colombo on 27 March 2011 said that he will consider a walk from Point Pedro (the extreme northern tip of Sri Lanka) to Dondra Head (the extreme southern tip of Sri Lanka) to raise funds for the project.

In June 2004, Muralitharan also joined the United Nations World Food Program as an ambassador to fight hunger among school children.

When the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake devastated Sri Lanka on 2004, Muralitharan contributed to the relief programs. He himself narrowly escaped death, arriving 20 minutes late at Seenigama, where he was to give away prizes at one of the charity projects he worked on. While international agencies were bringing food in by air, Muralitharan paid for and organised three convoys of ten trucks each to get assist in the distribution. He persuaded those who could to donate clothes, and supervised the delivery himself.

During the rehabilitation efforts in the tsunami&#x27;s aftermath, cement was in short supply. Muralitharan promptly signed an endorsement deal with Lafarge, a global cement giant, that was a straight barter, where cement would be supplied to the Foundation for Goodness in exchange for work Muralitharan did. During the first three years since the tsunami, the foundation raised more than US$ to help survivors, and has built homes, schools, sports facilities and computer centres.

==Other work==
On 1 August 2015, Muralitharan and fellow Sri Lankan cricketer Tillakaratne Dilshan were appointed by President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena as the Brand Ambassadors for the Presidential Task Force to combat kidney disease.

==In popular culture==
In July 2019, it was announced that a biopic would be made in Tamil titled &quot;800&quot; with actor Vijay Sethupathi portraying Muralitharan. The film was set to be produced by actor Rana Daggubati under his banner Suresh Productions with MS Sripathy director. However the filming was put on hold due to various reasons such as political opposition. On 8 October 2020, the filmmakers announced that the biopic film tentatively titled as &quot;800&quot; would be proceeded as planned and also revealed that first look poster of the film would be released sooner along with the details of cast and crew members.

Sethupathi received widespread criticism and backlash in the social media for portraying the role of Muttiah Muralitharan in the biopic flick. Netizens also claimed that Muralitharan himself is a pro Rajapaksa supporter and requested Sethupathi to leave the filming. In addition, politicians from Tamil Nadu also cautioned that a Tamil actor shouldn&#x27;t play the role of a Sri Lankan recalling the claims of genocide massacre of over 200,000 Sri Lankan Tamils during the final stage of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Dravidian outfit in Coimbaitore also urged Vijay Sethupathi to drop out from the project insisting that Muralitharan supported Sinhalese during the Sri Lankan Civil War. #Shame on Vijay Sethupathi hashtag was trending on the social media on 13 October 2020 soon after the motion poster release of the film which was released via Star Sports prior to the group stage match between Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad during the 2020 Indian Premier League. Muralitharan denied the allegations regarding supporting the killing of civilians during the civil war and insisted that the war should not be glorified. Due to the political upheavals regarding the film, Muralitharan himself urged Sethupathi to opt out of the project and the film project did not materialise.

On 17 April 2023, coinciding with the birthday of Muralitharan, the first look poster of the biopic titled &quot;800&quot; was released with Madhur Mittal replacing Sethupathi. The film, produced by Movie Train Motion Pictures, was filmed across Sri Lanka, Chennai, Cochin, England, and Australia.

<text>Mole Day is an unofficial holiday celebrated among chemists, chemistry students, and chemistry enthusiasts on October 23 between 6:02 a.m. and 6:02 p.m., making the date 6:02 10/23 in either MDY or YMD date formats. The time and date are derived from the Avogadro constant, which is approximately , defining the number of particles (atoms or molecules) in one mole (mol) of substance, one of the seven base SI units.

==Overview==
Mole Day originated from a celebration by educator Margaret Christoph. She wrote an article about her experiences in &quot;The Science Teacher&quot; in the 1980s. Inspired by this article, Maurice Oehler, a high school chemistry teacher from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, founded the National Mole Day Foundation (NMDF) on May 15, 1991.

Many high schools around the United States, South Africa, Australia, and Canada celebrate Mole Day as a way to get their students interested in chemistry, with various activities often related to chemistry or moles.

The American Chemical Society sponsors National Chemistry Week, which occurs from the Sunday through Saturday during which October 23 falls. This makes Mole Day an integral part of National Chemistry Week.
