<text>In mathematics, an operand is the object of a mathematical operation, i.e., it is the object or quantity that is operated on.

==Example ==
The following arithmetic expression shows an example of operators and operands:

:formula_1

In the above example, &#x27;+&#x27; is the symbol for the operation called addition.

The operand &#x27;3&#x27; is one of the inputs (quantities) followed by the addition operator, and the operand &#x27;6&#x27; is the other input necessary for the operation.

The result of the operation is 9. (The number &#x27;9&#x27; is also called the sum of the augend 3 and the addend 6.)

An operand, then, is also referred to as &quot;one of the inputs (quantities) for an operation&quot;.

==Notation==

===Expressions as operands===
Operands may be nested, and may consist of expressions also made up of operators with operands.

:formula_2

In the above expression &#x27;(3 + 5)&#x27; is the first operand for the multiplication operator and &#x27;2&#x27; the second. The operand &#x27;(3 + 5)&#x27; is an expression in itself, which contains an addition operator, with the operands &#x27;3&#x27; and &#x27;5&#x27;.
Rules of precedence affect which values form operands for which operators:

:formula_3

In the above expression, the multiplication operator has the higher precedence than the addition operator, so the multiplication operator has operands of &#x27;5&#x27; and &#x27;2&#x27;. The addition operator has operands of &#x27;3&#x27; and &#x27;5 × 2&#x27;.

===Positioning of operands===
Depending on the mathematical notation being used the position of an operator in relation to its operand(s) may vary. In everyday usage infix notation is the most common, however other notations also exist, such as the prefix and postfix notations. These alternate notations are most common within computer science.

Below is a comparison of three different notations — all represent an addition of the numbers &#x27;1&#x27; and &#x27;2&#x27;

:formula_4 (infix notation)

:formula_5 (prefix notation)

:formula_6 (postfix notation)

===Infix and the order of operation===
In a mathematical expression, the order of operation is carried out from left to right. Start with the leftmost value and seek the first operation to be carried out in accordance with the order specified above (i.e., start with parentheses and end with the addition/subtraction group). For example, in the expression

:formula_7,

the first operation to be acted upon is any and all expressions found inside a parenthesis. So beginning at the left and moving to the right, find the first (and in this case, the only) parenthesis, that is, (2 + 22). Within the parenthesis itself is found the expression 22. The reader is required to find the value of 22 before going any further. The value of 22 is 4. Having found this value, the remaining expression looks like this:

:formula_8

The next step is to calculate the value of expression inside the parenthesis itself, that is, (2 + 4) = 6. Our expression now looks like this:

:formula_9

Having calculated the parenthetical part of the expression, we start over again beginning with the left most value and move right. The next order of operation (according to the rules) is exponents. Start at the left most value, that is, 4, and scan your eyes to the right and search for the first exponent you come across. The first (and only) expression we come across that is expressed with an exponent is 22. We find the value of 22, which is 4. What we have left is the expression

:formula_10.

The next order of operation is multiplication. 4 × 4 is 16. Now our expression looks like this:

:formula_11

The next order of operation according to the rules is division. However, there is no division operator sign (÷) in the expression, 16 − 6. So we move on to the next order of operation, i.e., addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence and are done left to right.

:formula_12.

So the correct value for our original expression, 4 × 22 − (2 + 22), is 10.

It is important to carry out the order of operation in accordance with rules set by convention. If the reader evaluates an expression but does not follow the correct order of operation, the reader will come forth with a different value. The different value will be the incorrect value because the order of operation was not followed. The reader will arrive at the correct value for the expression if and only if each operation is carried out in the proper order.

===Arity===
The number of operands of an operator is called its arity. Based on arity, operators are chiefly classified as nullary (no operands), unary (1 operand), binary (2 operands), ternary (3 operands). Higher arities are less frequently denominated through a specific terms, all the more when function composition or currying can be used to avoid them. Other terms include:

* quaternary, tetranary (4)
* quinary, quintenary, quinquennary (5)
* hexanary, senary, sexenary (6)
* septenary (7)
* octonary (8)
* nonary, novenary (9)
* denary (10)
* undenary (11)
* duodenary (12)
* tridecennary (13)
* quindenary (15)
* vigenary (20)
* quadringenary (40)
* quinquagenary (50)
* sexagenary (60)
* septuagenary (70)
* octogenary (80)
* nonagenary (90)
* centenary (100)
* sesquicentenary (150)
* bicentenary (200)
* tercentenary, tricentenary (300)
* quadringentenary, quatercentenary (400)
* quincentenary (500)
* sexcentenary (600)
* septcentenary (700)
* octocentenary (800)
==Computer science==
In computer programming languages, the definitions of operator and operand are almost the same as in mathematics.

In computing, an operand is the part of a computer instruction which specifies what data is to be manipulated or operated on, while at the same time representing the data itself.
A computer instruction describes an operation such as add or multiply X, while the operand (or operands, as there can be more than one) specify on which X to operate as well as the value of X.

Additionally, in assembly language, an operand is a value (an argument) on which the instruction, named by mnemonic, operates. The operand may be a processor register, a memory address, a literal constant, or a label. A simple example (in the x86 architecture) is

MOV BX, AX

where the value in register operand codice_1 is to be moved (codice_2) into register codice_3. Depending on the instruction, there may be zero, one, two, or more operands.

<text>Order of magnitude is a concept used to discuss the &quot;scale&quot; of numbers in relation to one another. 

Two numbers are &quot;within an order of magnitude&quot; of each other if their ratio is between 1/10 and 10. In other words, the two numbers are within about a factor of 10 of each other.

For example, 1 and 1.02 are within an order of magnitude. So are 1 and 2, 1 and 9, or 1 and 0.2. However, 1 and 15 are not within an order of magnitude, since their ratio is 15/1 = 15 &gt; 10. The reciprocal ratio, 1/15, is less than 0.1, so the same result is obtained.

Differences in order of magnitude can be measured on a base-10 logarithmic scale in &quot;decades&quot; (i.e., factors of ten). For example, there is one order of magnitude between 2 and 20, and two orders of magnitude between 2 and 200. Each division or multiplication by 10 is called an order of magnitude. 
This phrasing helps quickly express the difference in scale between 2 and 2,000,000: they differ by 6 orders of magnitude.

Examples of numbers of different magnitudes can be found at Orders of magnitude (numbers).

Below are examples of different methods of partitioning the real numbers into specific &quot;orders of magnitude&quot; for various purposes. There is not one single accepted way of doing this, and different partitions may be easier to compute but less useful for approximation, or better for approximation but more difficult to compute.

==Calculating the order of magnitude==
Generally, the order of magnitude of a number is the smallest power of 10 used to represent that number. To work out the order of magnitude of a number formula_1, the number is first expressed in the following form:
:formula_2
where formula_3, or approximately formula_4. Then, formula_5 represents the order of magnitude of the number. The order of magnitude can be any integer. The table below enumerates the order of magnitude of some numbers using this definition:

The geometric mean of formula_6 and formula_7 is formula_8, meaning that a value of exactly formula_8 (i.e., formula_10) represents a geometric &quot;halfway point&quot; within the range of possible values of formula_11.

Some use a simpler definition where formula_12. This definition has the effect of lowering the values of formula_5 slightly:
==Uses==
Orders of magnitude are used to make approximate comparisons. If numbers differ by one order of magnitude, &quot;x&quot; is &quot;about&quot; ten times different in quantity than &quot;y&quot;. If values differ by two orders of magnitude, they differ by a factor of about 100. Two numbers of the same order of magnitude have roughly the same scale: the larger value is less than ten times the smaller value.
The growing amounts of Internet data have led to addition of new SI prefixes over time, most recently in 2022.

===Calculating the order of magnitude by truncation===
The order of magnitude of a number is, intuitively speaking, the number of powers of 10 contained in the number. More precisely, the order of magnitude of a number can be defined in terms of the common logarithm, usually as the integer part of the logarithm, obtained by truncation. For example, the number has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602; its order of magnitude is 6. When truncating, a number of this order of magnitude is between 106 and 107. In a similar example, with the phrase &quot;seven-figure income&quot;, the order of magnitude is the number of figures minus one, so it is very easily determined without a calculator to be 6. An order of magnitude is an approximate position on a logarithmic scale.

===Order-of-magnitude estimate===
An order-of-magnitude estimate of a variable, whose precise value is unknown, is an estimate rounded to the nearest power of ten. For example, an order-of-magnitude estimate for a variable between about 3 billion and 30 billion (such as the human population of the Earth) is 10 billion. To round a number to its nearest order of magnitude, one rounds its logarithm to the nearest integer. Thus , which has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602, has 7 as its nearest order of magnitude, because &quot;nearest&quot; implies rounding rather than truncation. For a number written in scientific notation, this logarithmic rounding scale requires rounding up to the next power of ten when the multiplier is greater than the square root of ten (about 3.162). For example, the nearest order of magnitude for is 8, whereas the nearest order of magnitude for is 9. An order-of-magnitude estimate is sometimes also called a zeroth order approximation.

==Non-decimal orders of magnitude==

An order of magnitude is an approximation of the logarithm of a value relative to some contextually understood reference value, usually 10, interpreted as the base of the logarithm and the representative of values of magnitude one. Logarithmic distributions are common in nature and considering the order of magnitude of values sampled from such a distribution can be more intuitive. When the reference value is 10, the order of magnitude can be understood as the number of digits minus one in the base-10 representation of the value. Similarly, if the reference value is one of some powers of 2 since computers store data in a binary format, the magnitude can be understood in terms of the amount of computer memory needed to store that value.

===Irrational orders of magnitude===
Other orders of magnitude may be calculated using bases other than integers. In the field of astronomy, the nighttime brightnesses of celestial bodies are ranked by &quot;magnitudes&quot; in which each increasing level is brighter by a factor of formula_14 greater than the previous level. Thus, a level being 5 magnitudes brighter than another indicates that it is a factor of formula_15 times brighter: that is, two base 10 orders of magnitude. 

This series of magnitudes forms a logarithmic scale with a base of formula_16.

===Base 1,000,000 orders of magnitude===
The different decimal numeral systems of the world use a larger base to better envision the size of the number, and have created names for the powers of this larger base. The table shows what number the order of magnitude aim at for base 10 and for base . It can be seen that the order of magnitude is included in the number name in this example, because bi- means 2, tri- means 3, etc. (these make sense in the long scale only), and the suffix -illion tells that the base is . But the number names billion, trillion themselves (here with other meaning than in the first chapter) are not names of the &quot;orders of&quot; magnitudes, they are names of &quot;magnitudes&quot;, that is the &quot;numbers&quot; etc.

SI units in the table at right are used together with SI prefixes, which were devised with mainly base 1000 magnitudes in mind. The IEC standard prefixes with base 1024 were invented for use in electronic technology.

<text>occam is a programming language which is concurrent and builds on the communicating sequential processes (CSP) process algebra, and shares many of its features. It is named after philosopher William of Ockham after whom Occam&#x27;s razor is named.

occam is an imperative procedural language (such as Pascal). It was developed by David May and others at Inmos (trademark INMOS), advised by Tony Hoare, as the native programming language for their transputer microprocessors, but implementations for other platforms are available. The most widely known version is occam 2; its programming manual was written by Steven Ericsson-Zenith and others at Inmos.

==Overview==
In the following examples indentation and formatting are critical for parsing the code: expressions are terminated by the end of the line, lists of expressions need to be on the same level of indentation. This feature, named the off-side rule, is also found in other languages such as Haskell and Python.

Communication between processes work through named &quot;channels&quot;. One process outputs data to a channel via codice_1 while another one inputs data with codice_2. Input and output cannot proceed until the other end is ready to accept or offer data. (In the &quot;not proceeding&quot; case it is often said that the process &quot;blocks&quot; on the channel. However, the program will neither spin nor poll; thus terms like &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;hang&quot; or &quot;yield&quot; may also convey the behaviour; also in the context that it will not &quot;block&quot; other independent processes from running.) Examples (c is a variable):

 keyboard ? c

 screen ! c

codice_3 introduces a list of expressions that are evaluated sequentially. This is not implicit as it is in most other programming languages. Example:

 SEQ
 x := x + 1
 y := x * x

codice_4 begins a list of expressions that may be evaluated concurrently. Example:

 PAR
 p()
 q()

codice_5 specifies a list of &quot;guarded&quot; commands. The guards are a combination of a Boolean condition and an input expression, both optional. Each guard for which the condition is true and the input channel is ready is successful. One of the successful alternatives is selected for execution. Example:

 ALT
 count1 &lt; 100 &amp; c1 ? data
 SEQ
 count1 := count1 + 1
 merged ! data
 count2 &lt; 100 &amp; c2 ? data
 SEQ
 count2 := count2 + 1
 merged ! data
 status ? request
 SEQ
 out ! count1
 out ! count2

This will read data from channels c1 or c2 (whichever is ready) and pass it into a merged channel. If countN reaches 100, reads from the corresponding channel will be disabled. A request on the status channel is answered by outputting the counts to codice_6.

==Language revisions==
===occam 1===
&quot;occam 1&quot; (released 1983) was a preliminary version of the language which borrowed from David May&#x27;s work on EPL and Tony Hoare&#x27;s CSP. This supported only the VAR data type, which was an integral type corresponding to the native word length of the target architecture, and arrays of only one dimension.

===occam 2===
&quot;occam 2&quot; is an extension produced by Inmos Ltd in 1987 that adds floating-point support, functions, multi-dimensional arrays and more data types such as varying sizes of integers (INT16, INT32) and bytes.

With this revision, occam became a language able to express useful programs, whereas occam 1 was more suited to examining algorithms and exploring the new language (however, the occam 1 compiler was written in occam 1, so there is an existence proof that reasonably sized, useful programs could be written in occam 1, despite its limits).

===occam 2.1===
&quot;occam 2.1&quot; was the last of the series of occam language developments contributed by Inmos. Defined in 1994, it was influenced by an earlier proposal for an occam 3 language (also referred to as &quot;occam91&quot; during its early development) created by Geoff Barrett at Inmos in the early 1990s. A revised Reference Manual describing occam 3 was distributed for community comment, but the language was never fully implemented in a compiler.

occam 2.1 introduced several new features to occam 2, including:
*Named data types (DATA TYPE x IS y)
*Named records
*Packed records
*Relaxation of some of the type conversion rules
*New operators (e.g. BYTESIN)
*Channel retyping and channel arrays
*Ability to return fixed-length array from function.

For a full list of the changes see Appendix P of the Inmos occam 2.1 Reference Manual.

===occam-π===
&quot;occam-π&quot; is the common name for the occam variant implemented by later versions of the Kent Retargetable occam Compiler (KRoC). The addition of the symbol &quot;π&quot; (pi) to the occam name is an allusion to KRoC occam including several ideas inspired by the π-calculus. It contains several significant extensions to the occam 2.1 compiler, for example:
*Nested protocols
*Run-time process creation
*Mobile channels, data, and processes
*Recursion
*Protocol inheritance
*Array constructors
*Extended rendezvous

<doc id="22661" wikidata="Q42976" url="?curid=22661" title="October Revolution">
<text>The October Revolution, also known as the Great October Socialist Revolution (in Soviet historiography), October coup, Bolshevik coup, or Bolshevik revolution, was the second of two revolutions in Russia in 1917. It was led by Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Bolsheviks as part of the broader Russian Revolution of 1917–1923. It began through an insurrection in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) on . It was the precipitating event of the Russian Civil War. The initial stage of the October Revolution, which involved the assault on Petrograd, occurred largely without any casualties.

The October Revolution followed and capitalized on the February Revolution earlier that year, which had led to the abdication of Nicholas II and the creation of the Russian Provisional Government. The provisional government, led by Alexander Kerensky, had taken power after Grand Duke Michael, the younger brother of Nicholas II, declined to take power. During this time, urban workers began to organize into councils (soviets) wherein revolutionaries criticized the provisional government and its actions. The provisional government remained unpopular, especially because it was continuing to fight in World War I, and had ruled with an iron fist throughout mid-1917 (including killing hundreds of protesters in the July Days). It declared the Russian Republic on 1 [N.S. 14 ] September 1917.

The situation grew critical in late 1917 as the Directorate, led by the left-wing Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries (SRs), controlled the government. The far-left Bolsheviks were deeply unhappy with the government, and began spreading calls for a military uprising. On 10 [N.S. 23] October 1917, the Petrograd Soviet, led by Leon Trotsky, voted to back a military uprising. On 24 October [N.S. 6 November], the government closed numerous newspapers and closed Petrograd, attempting to forestall the revolution; minor armed skirmishes ensued. The next day, a full-scale uprising erupted as a fleet of Bolshevik sailors entered the harbor and tens of thousands of soldiers rose up in support of the Bolsheviks. Bolshevik Red Guards under the Military-Revolutionary Committee began to occupy government buildings. In the early morning of 26 October [N.S. 8 November], they captured the Winter Palace — the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia.

As the revolution was not universally recognized, the country descended into Civil War, which would last until late 1922 and ultimately lead to the creation of the Soviet Union. The historiography of the event has varied. The victorious Soviet Union viewed it as a validation of its ideology and the triumph of the working class over capitalism. On the other hand, the western allies later intervened against the Bolsheviks in the civil war. The Revolution inspired many cultural works and ignited communist movements globally. October Revolution Day was a public holiday in the Soviet Union, marking its key role in the state&#x27;s founding, and many communist parties around the world celebrate it.

==Etymology==
Despite occurring in November of the Gregorian calendar, the event is most commonly known as the &quot;October Revolution&quot; () because at the time Russia still used the Julian calendar. The event is sometimes known as the &quot;November Revolution&quot;, after the Soviet Union modernized its calendar. To avoid confusion, both O.S and N.S. dates have been given for events. For more details see Old Style and New Style dates. It was sometimes known as the Bolshevik Revolution, or the Communist Revolution.

Initially the event was referred to as the &quot;October coup&quot; () or the &quot;Uprising of the 3rd&quot;, as seen in contemporary documents, for example in the first editions of Lenin&#x27;s complete works.

==Background==

===February Revolution===
The February Revolution had toppled Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and replaced his government with the Russian Provisional Government. However, the provisional government was weak and riven by internal dissension. It continued to wage World War I, which became increasingly unpopular. There was a nationwide crisis affecting social, economic, and political relations. Disorder in industry and transport had intensified, and difficulties in obtaining provisions had increased. Gross industrial production in 1917 decreased by over 36% of what it had been in 1914. In the autumn, as much as 50% of all enterprises in the Urals, the Donbas, and other industrial centers were closed down, leading to mass unemployment. At the same time, the cost of living increased sharply. Real wages fell to about 50% of what they had been in 1913. By October 1917, Russia&#x27;s national debt had risen to 50 billion roubles. Of this, debts to foreign governments constituted more than 11 billion roubles. The country faced the threat of financial bankruptcy.

=== German support ===

Vladimir Lenin, who had been living in exile in Switzerland, with other dissidents organized a plan to negotiate a passage for them through Germany, with whom Russia was then at war. Recognizing that these dissidents could cause problems for their Russian enemies, the German government agreed to permit 32 Russian citizens, among them Lenin and his wife, to travel in a sealed train carriage through their territory.

Upon his arrival in Petrograd on 3 April 1917, Lenin issued his April Theses that called on the Bolsheviks to take over the Provisional Government, usurp power, and end the war.

===Unrest by workers, peasants, and soldiers===
Throughout June, July, and August 1917, it was common to hear working-class Russians speak about their lack of confidence in the Provisional Government. Factory workers around Russia felt unhappy with the growing shortages of food, supplies, and other materials. They blamed their managers or foremen and would even attack them in the factories. The workers blamed many rich and influential individuals for the overall shortage of food and poor living conditions. Workers saw these rich and powerful individuals as opponents of the Revolution and called them &quot;bourgeois&quot;, &quot;capitalist&quot;, and &quot;imperialist&quot;.

In September and October 1917, there were mass strike actions by the Moscow and Petrograd workers, miners in the Donbas, metalworkers in the Urals, oil workers in Baku, textile workers in the Central Industrial Region, and railroad workers on 44 railway lines. In these months alone, more than a million workers took part in strikes. Workers established control over production and distribution in many factories and plants in a social revolution. Workers organized these strikes through factory committees. The factory committees represented the workers and were able to negotiate better working conditions, pay, and hours. Even though workplace conditions may have been increasing in quality, the overall quality of life for workers was not improving. There were still shortages of food and the increased wages workers had obtained did little to provide for their families.

By October 1917, peasant uprisings were common. By autumn, the peasant movement against the landowners had spread to 482 of 624 counties, or 77% of the country. As 1917 progressed, the peasantry increasingly began to lose faith that the land would be distributed to them by the Social Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks. Refusing to continue living as before, they increasingly took measures into their own hands, as can be seen by the increase in the number and militancy of the peasant&#x27;s actions. Over 42% of all the cases of destruction (usually burning down and seizing property from the landlord&#x27;s estate) recorded between February and October occurred in October. While the uprisings varied in severity, complete uprisings and seizures of the land were not uncommon. Less robust forms of protest included marches on landowner manors and government offices, as well as withholding and storing grains rather than selling them. When the Provisional Government sent punitive detachments, it only enraged the peasants. In September, the garrisons in Petrograd, Moscow, and other cities, the Northern and Western fronts, and the sailors of the Baltic Fleet declared through their elected representative body Tsentrobalt that they did not recognize the authority of the Provisional Government and would not carry out any of its commands.

Soldiers&#x27; wives were key players in the unrest in the villages. From 1914 to 1917, almost 50% of healthy men were sent to war, and many were killed on the front, resulting in many females being head of the household. Often—when government allowances were late and were not sufficient to match the rising costs of goods—soldiers&#x27; wives sent masses of appeals to the government, which went largely unanswered. Frustration resulted, and these women were influential in inciting &quot;subsistence riots&quot;—also referred to as &quot;hunger riots&quot;, &quot;pogroms&quot;, or &quot;baba riots&quot;. In these riots, citizens seized food and resources from shop owners, who they believed to be charging unfair prices. Upon police intervention, protesters responded with &quot;rakes, sticks, rocks, and fists.&quot;

===Antiwar demonstrations===
In a diplomatic note of 1 May, the minister of foreign affairs, Pavel Milyukov, expressed the Provisional Government&#x27;s desire to continue the war against the Central Powers &quot;to a victorious conclusion&quot;, arousing broad indignation. On 1–4 May, about 100,000 workers and soldiers of Petrograd, and, after them, the workers and soldiers of other cities, led by the Bolsheviks, demonstrated under banners reading &quot;Down with the war!&quot; and &quot;All power to the soviets!&quot; The mass demonstrations resulted in a crisis for the Provisional Government. 1 July saw more demonstrations, as about 500,000 workers and soldiers in Petrograd demonstrated, again demanding &quot;all power to the soviets,&quot; &quot;down with the war,&quot; and &quot;down with the ten capitalist ministers.&quot; The Provisional Government opened an offensive against the Central Powers on 1 July, which soon collapsed. The news of the offensive&#x27;s failure intensified the struggle of the workers and the soldiers.

===July days===

On 16 July, spontaneous demonstrations of workers and soldiers began in Petrograd, demanding that power be turned over to the soviets. The Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party provided leadership to the spontaneous movements. On 17 July, over 500,000 people participated in what was intended to be a peaceful demonstration in Petrograd, the so-called July Days. The Provisional Government, with the support of Socialist-Revolutionary Party-Menshevik leaders of the All-Russian Executive Committee of the Soviets, ordered an armed attack against the demonstrators, killing hundreds.

A period of repression followed. On 5–6 July, attacks were made on the editorial offices and printing presses of &quot;Pravda&quot; and on the Palace of Kshesinskaya, where the Central Committee and the Petrograd Committee of the Bolsheviks were located. On 7 July, the government ordered the arrest and trial of Vladimir Lenin, who was forced to go underground, as he had done under the Tsarist regime. Bolsheviks were arrested, workers were disarmed, and revolutionary military units in Petrograd were disbanded or sent to the war front. On 12 July, the Provisional Government published a law introducing the death penalty at the front. The second coalition government was formed on 24 July, chaired by Alexander Kerensky and consisted mostly of Socialists. Kerensky&#x27;s government introduced a number of liberal rights, such as freedom of speech, equality before the law, and the right to form unions and arrange labor strikes.

In response to a Bolshevik appeal, Moscow&#x27;s working class began a protest strike of 400,000 workers. They were supported by strikes and protest rallies by workers in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Nizhny Novgorod, Ekaterinburg, and other cities.

===Kornilov affair===
In what became known as the Kornilov affair, General Lavr Kornilov, who had been Commander-in-Chief since 18 July, with Kerensky&#x27;s agreement directed an army under Aleksandr Krymov to march toward Petrograd to restore order. According to some accounts, Kerensky appeared to become frightened by the possibility that the army would stage a coup, and reversed the order. By contrast, historian Richard Pipes has argued that the episode was engineered by Kerensky. On 27 August, feeling betrayed by the government, Kornilov pushed on towards Petrograd. With few troops to spare at the front, Kerensky turned to the Petrograd Soviet for help. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, and Socialist Revolutionaries confronted the army and convinced them to stand down. The Bolsheviks&#x27; influence over railroad and telegraph workers also proved vital in stopping the movement of troops. The political right felt betrayed, and the left was resurgent. The first direct consequence of Kornilov&#x27;s failed coup was the formal abolition of the monarchy and the proclamation of the Russian Republic on 1 September.

With Kornilov defeated, the Bolsheviks&#x27; popularity in the soviets grew significantly, both in the central and local areas. On 31 August, the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies—and, on 5 September, the Moscow Soviet Workers Deputies—adopted the Bolshevik resolutions on the question of power. The Bolsheviks were able to take over in Briansk, Samara, Saratov, Tsaritsyn, Minsk, Kiev, Tashkent, and other cities.

==Revolution ==

===Planning===

On 10 October 1917 (O.S.; 23 October, N.S.), the Bolsheviks&#x27; Central Committee voted 10–2 for a resolution saying that &quot;an armed uprising is inevitable, and that the time for it is fully ripe.&quot; At the Committee meeting, Lenin discussed how the people of Russia had waited long enough for &quot;an armed uprising,&quot; and it was the Bolsheviks&#x27; time to take power. Lenin expressed his confidence in the success of the planned insurrection. His confidence stemmed from months of Bolshevik buildup of power and successful elections to different committees and councils in major cities such as Petrograd and Moscow. Membership of the Bolshevik party had risen from 24,000 members in February 1917 to 200,000 members by September 1917.

The Bolsheviks created a revolutionary military committee within the Petrograd soviet, led by the Soviet&#x27;s president, Leon Trotsky. The committee included armed workers, sailors, and soldiers, and assured the support or neutrality of the capital&#x27;s garrison. The committee methodically planned to occupy strategic locations through the city, almost without concealing their preparations: the Provisional Government&#x27;s President Kerensky was himself aware of them; and some details, leaked by Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev, were published in newspapers.

===Onset===

In the early morning of 24 October (O.S.; 6 November N.S.), a group of soldiers loyal to Kerensky&#x27;s government marched on the printing house of the Bolshevik newspaper, &quot;Rabochiy put&quot; (&quot;Worker&#x27;s Path&quot;), seizing and destroying printing equipment and thousands of newspapers. Shortly thereafter, the government announced the immediate closure of not only &quot;Rabochiy put&quot; but also the left-wing &quot;Soldat&quot;, as well as the far-right newspapers &quot;Zhivoe slovo&quot; and &quot;Novaia Rus&quot;. The editors and contributors of these newspapers were seen to be calling for insurrection and were to be prosecuted on criminal charges.

In response, at 9a.m. the Bolshevik Military Revolutionary Committee issued a statement denouncing the government&#x27;s actions. At 10a.m., Bolshevik-aligned soldiers successfully retook the &quot;Rabochiy put&quot; printing house. Kerensky responded at approximately 3p.m. that afternoon by ordering the raising of all but one of Petrograd&#x27;s bridges, a tactic used by the government several months earlier during the July Days. What followed was a series of sporadic clashes over control of the bridges, between Red Guard militias aligned with the Military-Revolutionary Committee and military units still loyal to the government. At approximately 5p.m. the Military-Revolutionary Committee seized the Central Telegraph of Petrograd, giving the Bolsheviks control over communications through the city.

On 25 October (O.S.; 7 November, N.S.) 1917, the Bolsheviks led their forces in the uprising in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg, then capital of Russia) against the Provisional Government. The event coincided with the arrival of a pro-Bolshevik flotilla—consisting primarily of five destroyers and their crews, as well as marines—in Petrograd harbor. At Kronstadt, sailors announced their allegiance to the Bolshevik insurrection. In the early morning, from its heavily guarded and picketed headquarters in Smolny Palace, the Military-Revolutionary Committee designated the last of the locations to be assaulted or seized. The Red Guards systematically captured major government facilities, key communication installations, and vantage points with little opposition. The Petrograd Garrison and most of the city&#x27;s military units joined the insurrection against the Provisional Government. The insurrection was timed and organized to hand state power to the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies, which began on this day.

Kerensky and the Provisional Government were virtually helpless to offer significant resistance. Railways and railway stations had been controlled by Soviet workers and soldiers for days, making rail travel to and from Petrograd impossible for Provisional Government officials. The Provisional Government was also unable to locate any serviceable vehicles. On the morning of the insurrection, Kerensky desperately searched for a means of reaching military forces he hoped would be friendly to the Provisional Government outside the city and ultimately borrowed a Renault car from the American embassy, which he drove from the Winter Palace, along with a Pierce Arrow. Kerensky was able to evade the pickets going up around the palace and to drive to meet approaching soldiers.

As Kerensky left Petrograd, Lenin wrote a proclamation &quot;To the Citizens of Russia&quot;, stating that the Provisional Government had been overthrown by the Military-Revolutionary Committee. The proclamation was sent by telegraph throughout Russia, even as the pro-Soviet soldiers were seizing important control centers throughout the city. One of Lenin&#x27;s intentions was to present members of the Soviet congress, who would assemble that afternoon, with a &quot;fait accompli&quot; and thus forestall further debate on the wisdom or legitimacy of taking power.

===Assault on the Winter Palace===
A final assault against the Winter Palace—against 3,000 cadets, officers, cossacks, and female soldiers—was not vigorously resisted. The Bolsheviks delayed the assault because they could not find functioning artillery. At 6:15p.m., a large group of artillery cadets abandoned the palace, taking their artillery with them. At 8:00p.m., 200 cossacks left the palace and returned to their barracks.

While the cabinet of the provisional government within the palace debated what action to take, the Bolsheviks issued an ultimatum to surrender. Workers and soldiers occupied the last of the telegraph stations, cutting off the cabinet&#x27;s communications with loyal military forces outside the city. As the night progressed, crowds of insurgents surrounded the palace, and many infiltrated it. At 9:45p.m, the cruiser &quot;Aurora&quot; fired a blank shot from the harbor. Some of the revolutionaries entered the palace at 10:25p.m. and there was a mass entry 3 hours later.

By 2:10a.m. on 26 October, Bolshevik forces had gained control. The Cadets and the 140 volunteers of the Women&#x27;s Battalion surrendered rather than resist the 40,000 strong attacking force. After sporadic gunfire throughout the building, the cabinet of the Provisional Government surrendered, and were imprisoned in Peter and Paul Fortress. The only member who was not arrested was Kerensky himself, who had already left the palace.

With the Petrograd Soviet now in control of government, garrison, and proletariat, the Second All Russian Congress of Soviets held its opening session on the day, while Trotsky dismissed the opposing Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries (SR) from Congress.

===Dybenko&#x27;s disputed role===
Some sources contend that as the leader of Tsentrobalt, Pavlo Dybenko played a crucial role in the revolt and that the ten warships that arrived at the city with ten thousand Baltic Fleet mariners were the force that took the power in Petrograd and put down the Provisional Government. The same mariners then dispersed by force the elected parliament of Russia, and used machine-gun fire against demonstrators in Petrograd, killing about 100 demonstrators and wounding several hundred. Dybenko in his memoirs mentioned this event as &quot;several shots in the air&quot;. These are disputed by various sources, such as Louise Bryant, who claims that news outlets in the West at the time reported that the unfortunate loss of life occurred in Moscow, not Petrograd, and the number was much less than suggested above. As for the &quot;several shots in the air&quot;, there is little evidence suggesting otherwise.

===Later Soviet portrayal===
While the seizure of the Winter Palace happened almost without resistance, Soviet historians and officials later tended to depict the event in dramatic and heroic terms. The historical reenactment titled &quot;The Storming of the Winter Palace&quot; was staged in 1920. This reenactment, watched by 100,000 spectators, provided the model for official films made later, which showed fierce fighting during the storming of the Winter Palace, although, in reality, the Bolshevik insurgents had faced little opposition.

Later accounts of the heroic &quot;storming of the Winter Palace&quot; and &quot;defense of the Winter Palace&quot; were propaganda by Bolshevik publicists. Grandiose paintings depicting the &quot;Women&#x27;s Battalion&quot; and photo stills taken from Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s staged film depicting the &quot;politically correct&quot; version of the October events in Petrograd came to be taken as truth.

Historical falsification of political events such as the October Revolution and the Brest-Litovsk Treaty became a distinctive element of Stalin&#x27;s regime. A notable example is the 1938 publication, &quot;History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)&quot;, in which the history of the governing party was significantly altered and revised including the importance of the leading figures during the Bolshevik revolution. Retrospectively, Lenin&#x27;s primary associates such as Zinoviev, Trotsky, Radek and Bukharin were presented as &quot;vacillating&quot;, &quot;opportunists&quot; and &quot;foreign spies&quot; whereas Stalin was depicted as the chief discipline during the revolution. However, in reality, Stalin was considered a relatively unknown figure with secondary importance at the time of the event.

In his book, &quot;The Stalin School of Falsification&quot;, Leon Trotsky argued that the Stalinist faction routinely distorted historical events and the importance of Bolshevik figures especially during the October Revolution. He cited a range of historical documents such as private letters, telegrams, party speeches, meeting minutes, and suppressed texts such as Lenin&#x27;s Testament.

==Outcome==

===New government established===

Lenin initially turned down the leading position of Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars when the Bolsheviks formed a new government, after the October Revolution in 1917, and suggested Trotsky for the position. However, Trotsky refused the position and other Bolsheviks insisted that Lenin assume principal responsibility which resulted in Lenin eventually accepting the role of chairman.

The Second Congress of Soviets consisted of 670 elected delegates: 300 were Bolsheviks and nearly 100 were Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who also supported the overthrow of the Alexander Kerensky government. When the fall of the Winter Palace was announced, the Congress adopted a decree transferring power to the Soviets of Workers&#x27;, Soldiers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Deputies, thus ratifying the Revolution.

The transfer of power was not without disagreement. The center and right wings of the Socialist Revolutionaries, as well as the Mensheviks, believed that Lenin and the Bolsheviks had illegally seized power and they walked out before the resolution was passed. As they exited, they were taunted by Trotsky who told them &quot;You are pitiful isolated individuals; you are bankrupts; your role is played out. Go where you belong from now on—into the dustbin of history!&quot;

The following day, 26 October, the Congress elected a new cabinet of Bolsheviks, pending the convocation of a Constituent Assembly. This new Soviet government was known as the council (Soviet) of People&#x27;s Commissars (Sovnarkom), with Lenin as a leader. Lenin allegedly approved of the name, reporting that it &quot;smells of revolution&quot;. The cabinet quickly passed the Decree on Peace and the Decree on Land. This new government was also officially called &quot;provisional&quot; until the Assembly was dissolved.

===Anti-Bolshevik sentiment===
That same day, posters were pinned on walls and fences by the Socialist Revolutionaries, describing the takeover as a &quot;crime against the motherland&quot; and &quot;revolution&quot;; this signaled the next wave of anti-Bolshevik sentiment. The next day, the Mensheviks seized power in Georgia and declared it an independent republic; the Don Cossacks also claimed control of their government. The Bolshevik strongholds were in the cities, particularly Petrograd, with support much more mixed in rural areas. The peasant-dominated Left SR party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. There were reports that the Provisional Government had not conceded defeat and were meeting with the army at the Front.

Anti-Bolshevik sentiment continued to grow as posters and newspapers started criticizing the actions of the Bolsheviks and repudiated their authority. The executive committee of Peasants Soviets &quot;[refuted] with indignation all participation of the organized peasantry in this criminal violation of the will of the working class&quot;. This eventually developed into major counter-revolutionary action, as on 30 October (O.S., 12 November, N.S.) when Cossacks, welcomed by church bells, entered Tsarskoye Selo on the outskirts of Petrograd with Kerensky riding on a white horse. Kerensky gave an ultimatum to the rifle garrison to lay down weapons, which was promptly refused. They were then fired upon by Kerensky&#x27;s Cossacks, which resulted in 8 deaths. This turned soldiers in Petrograd against Kerensky as being the Tsarist regime. Kerensky&#x27;s failure to assume authority over troops was described by John Reed as a &quot;fatal blunder&quot; that signaled the final end of his government. Over the following days, the battle against the anti-Bolsheviks continued. The Red Guard fought against Cossacks at Tsarskoye Selo, with the Cossacks breaking rank and fleeing, leaving their artillery behind. On 31 October 1917 (13 November, N.S.), the Bolsheviks gained control of Moscow after a week of bitter street-fighting. Artillery had been freely used, with an estimated 700 casualties. However, there was continued support for Kerensky in some of the provinces.

After the fall of Moscow, there was only minor public anti-Bolshevik sentiment, such as the newspaper &quot;Novaya Zhizn&quot;, which criticized the Bolsheviks&#x27; lack of manpower and organization in running their party, let alone a government. Lenin confidently claimed that there is &quot;not a shadow of hesitation in the masses of Petrograd, Moscow and the rest of Russia&quot; in accepting Bolshevik rule.

===Governmental reforms===
On 10 November 1917 (23 November, N.S.), the government applied the term &quot;citizens of the Russian Republic&quot; to Russians, whom they sought to make equal in all possible respects, by the nullification of all &quot;legal designations of civil inequality, such as estates, titles, and ranks.&quot;

The long-awaited Constituent Assembly elections were held on 12 November (O.S., 25 November, N.S.) 1917. In contrast to their majority in the Soviets, the Bolsheviks only won 175 seats in the 715-seat legislative body, coming in second behind the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which won 370 seats, although the SR Party no longer existed as a whole party by that time, as the Left SRs had gone into coalition with the Bolsheviks from October 1917 to March 1918 (a cause of dispute of the legitimacy of the returned seating of the Constituent Assembly, as the old lists, were drawn up by the old SR Party leadership, and thus represented mostly Right SRs, whereas the peasant soviet deputies had returned majorities for the pro-Bolshevik Left SRs). The Constituent Assembly was to first meet on 28 November (O.S.) 1917, but its convocation was delayed until 5 January (O.S.; 18 January, N.S.) 1918 by the Bolsheviks. On its first and only day in session, the Constituent Assembly came into conflict with the Soviets, and it rejected Soviet decrees on peace and land, resulting in the Constituent Assembly being dissolved the next day by order of the Congress of Soviets.

On 16 December 1917 (29 December, N.S.), the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated.

On 20 December 1917 (2 January 1918, N.S.), the Cheka was created by Lenin&#x27;s decree. These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks&#x27; consolidation of power over their political opponents. The Red Terror began in September 1918, following a failed assassination attempt on Lenin. The French Jacobin Terror was an example for the Soviet Bolsheviks. Trotsky had compared Lenin to Maximilien Robespierre as early as 1904, when Trotsky was a critic of Lenin and his political opponent within the Marxist movement. In his book, &quot;Terrorism and Communism: A Reply to Karl Kautsky,&quot; Trotsky argued that the reign of terror began with the White Terror under the White Guard forces and the Bolsheviks responded with the Red Terror.

The Decree on Land ratified the actions of the peasants who throughout Russia had taken private land and redistributed it among themselves. The Bolsheviks viewed themselves as representing an alliance of workers and peasants signified by the Hammer and Sickle on the flag and the coat of arms of the Soviet Union.
Other decrees:
*All private property was nationalized by the government.
*All Russian banks were nationalized.
*Private bank accounts were expropriated.
*The properties of the Russian Orthodox Church (including bank accounts) were expropriated.
*All foreign debts were repudiated.
*Control of the factories was given to the soviets.
*Wages were fixed at higher rates than during the war, and a shorter, eight-hour working day was introduced.

==Russian Civil War==

Bolshevik-led attempts to gain power in other parts of the Russian Empire were largely successful in Russia proper—although the fighting in Moscow lasted for two weeks—but they were less successful in ethnically non-Russian parts of the Empire, which had been clamoring for independence since the February Revolution. For example, the Ukrainian Rada, which had declared autonomy on 23 June 1917, created the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic on 20 November, which was supported by the Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. This led to an armed conflict with the Bolshevik government in Petrograd and, eventually, a Ukrainian declaration of independence from Russia on 25 January 1918. In Estonia, two rival governments emerged: the Estonian Provincial Assembly, established in April 1917, proclaimed itself the supreme legal authority of Estonia on 28 November 1917 and issued the Declaration of Independence on 24 February 1918; but Soviet Russia recognized the executive committee of the Soviets of Estonia as the legal authority in the province, although the Soviets in Estonia controlled only the capital and a few other major towns.

After the success of the October Revolution transformed the Russian state into a soviet republic, a coalition of anti-Bolshevik groups attempted to unseat the new government in the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1922. In an attempt to intervene in the civil war after the Bolsheviks&#x27; separate peace with the Central Powers (Germany and the Ottoman Empire), the Allied Powers (the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the United States, and Japan) occupied parts of the Soviet Union for over two years before finally withdrawing. By the end of the violent civil war, Russia&#x27;s economy and infrastructure were heavily damaged, and as many as 10 million perished during the war, mostly civilians. Millions became White émigrés, and the Russian famine of 1921–1922 claimed up to five million victims. The United States did not recognize the new Russian government until 1933. The European powers recognized the Soviet Union in the early 1920s and began to engage in business with it after the New Economic Policy (NEP) was implemented.

==Historiography==
There have been few events where the political opinions of researchers have influenced their historical research as significantly as the October Revolution. Generally, the historiography of the Revolution generally divides into three camps: Soviet-Marxist, Western-Totalitarian, and Revisionist.

===Soviet historiography===
Soviet historiography of the October Revolution is intertwined with Soviet historical development. Many of the initial Soviet interpreters of the Revolution were themselves Bolshevik revolutionaries. Bolshevik figures such as Anatoly Lunacharsky, Moisei Uritsky and Dmitry Manuilsky agreed that Lenin&#x27;s influence on the Bolshevik party was decisive but the October insurrection was carried out according to Trotsky&#x27;s, not to Lenin&#x27;s plan. After the initial wave of revolutionary narratives, Soviet historians worked within &quot;narrow guidelines&quot; defined by the Soviet government. The rigidity of interpretive possibilities reached its height under Stalin.

Soviet historians of the Revolution interpreted the October Revolution as being about establishing the legitimacy of Marxist ideology and the Bolshevik government. To establish the accuracy of Marxist ideology, Soviet historians generally described the Revolution as the product of class struggle and that it was the supreme event in a world history governed by historical laws. The Bolshevik Party is placed at the center of the Revolution, as it exposes the errors of both the moderate Provisional Government and the spurious &quot;socialist&quot; Mensheviks in the Petrograd Soviet. Guided by Lenin&#x27;s leadership and his firm grasp of scientific Marxist theory, the Party led the &quot;logically predetermined&quot; events of the October Revolution from beginning to end. The events were, according to these historians, logically predetermined because of the socio-economic development of Russia, where monopolistic industrial capitalism had alienated the masses. In this view, the Bolshevik party took the leading role in organizing these alienated industrial workers, and thereby established the construction of the first socialist state.

Although Soviet historiography of the October Revolution stayed relatively constant until 1991, it did undergo some changes. Following Stalin&#x27;s death, historians such as E. N. Burdzhalov and P. V. Volobuev published historical research that deviated significantly from the party line in refining the doctrine that the Bolshevik victory &quot;was predetermined by the state of Russia&#x27;s socio-economic development&quot;. These historians, who constituted the &quot;New Directions Group&quot;, posited that the complex nature of the October Revolution &quot;could only be explained by a multi-causal analysis, not by recourse to the mono-causality of monopoly capitalism&quot;. For them, the central actor is still the Bolshevik party, but this party triumphed &quot;because it alone could solve the preponderance of &#x27;general democratic&#x27; tasks the country faced&quot; (such as the struggle for peace and the exploitation of landlords).

During the late Soviet period, the opening of select Soviet archives during glasnost sparked innovative research that broke away from some aspects of Marxism–Leninism, though the key features of the orthodox Soviet view remained intact.

Following the turn of the 21st century, some Soviet historians began to implement an &quot;anthropological turn&quot; in their historiographical analysis of the Russian Revolution. This method of analysis focuses on the average person&#x27;s experience of day-to-day life during the revolution, and pulls the analytical focus away from larger events, notable revolutionaries, and overarching claims about party views. In 2006, S. V. Iarov employed this methodology when he focused on citizen adjustment to the new Soviet system. Iarov explored the dwindling labor protests, evolving forms of debate, and varying forms of politicization as a result of the new Soviet rule from 1917 to 1920. In 2010, O. S. Nagornaia took interest in the personal experiences of Russian prisoners-of-war taken by Germany, examining Russian soldiers and officers&#x27; ability to cooperate and implement varying degrees of autocracy despite being divided by class, political views, and race. Other analyses following this &quot;anthropological turn&quot; have explored texts from soldiers and how they used personal war-experiences to further their political goals, as well as how individual life-structure and psychology may have shaped major decisions in the civil war that followed the revolution.

===Western historiography===

==== &quot;Totalitarian&quot; historians ====
During the Cold War, Western historiography of the October Revolution developed in direct response to the assertions of the Soviet view. As a result, Western historians exposed what they believed were flaws in the Soviet view, thereby undermining the Bolsheviks&#x27; original legitimacy, as well as the precepts of Marxism. The view which originated in the early years of the Cold War became known as &quot;traditionalist&quot; and &quot;totalitarian&quot; as well as &quot;Cold War&quot; historians for relying on concepts and interpretations rooted in the early years of the Cold War and even in the sphere Russian White émigrés of the 1920s.

These &quot;traditionalist&quot; historians described the revolution as the result of a chain of contingent accidents. Examples of these accidental and contingent factors they say precipitated the Revolution included World War I&#x27;s timing, chance, and the poor leadership of Tsar Nicholas II as well as that of liberal and moderate socialists. According to &quot;totalitarian&quot; historians, it was not popular support, but rather a manipulation of the masses, ruthlessness, and the party discipline of the Bolsheviks that enabled their triumph. For these historians, the Bolsheviks&#x27; defeat in the Constituent Assembly elections of November–December 1917 demonstrated popular opposition to the Bolsheviks&#x27; revolution, as did the scale and breadth of the Civil War.

&quot;Totalitarian&quot; historians saw the organization of the Bolshevik party as totalitarian. Their interpretation of the October Revolution as a violent coup organized by a totalitarian party which aborted Russia&#x27;s experiment in democracy. Thus, Stalinist totalitarianism developed as a natural progression from Leninism and the Bolshevik party&#x27;s tactics and organization. To these historians, Soviet Russia in 1917 was as totalitarian as the USSR under Joseph Stalin in 1930s. More to it, such historians have blamed Lenin and the Bolsheviks for inventing policies further implemented by totalitarian regimes of the 20th century, such as the Holocaust: for example, according to Richard Pipes, a prominent &quot;totalitarian&quot;, &quot;The Stalinist and Nazi holocausts&quot; stemmed from Lenin&#x27;s Red Terror and had &quot;much greater decorum&quot; than the latter.

==== &quot;Revisionist&quot; historians ====
The 1960s-1970s saw a rise of a young historians who opposed the &quot;totalitarian&quot; historians and began challenging, revising and refuting the dominant and accepted conceptions, as well as criticizing the bias towards the USSR and the Left in general; they lacked a full-fledged doctrine or philosophy of history, but were distinguished as &quot;revisionists&quot;; in contrast with the focus of &quot;totalitarian&quot; historians on &quot;politics&quot; &quot;from above&quot; and on personalities of the leaders of political movements, &quot;the one man&quot;, the revisionists have produced &quot;history from below&quot; and put attention on social history. These historians tend to see a rupture between Stalinist totalitarianism and Leninism and refute the definition of the Revolution as a totalitarian coup carried out by a minority group; the &#x27;revisionists&#x27; stress the genuinely &#x27;popular&#x27; nature of the Bolshevik Revolution. According to Evan Mawdsley, &quot;the &#x27;revisionist’ school had been dominant from the 1970s&quot; in academic circles, and achieved &quot;some success&quot; in challenging the traditionalists; however, they continued to be criticized by &quot;totalitarians&quot; who accused them of &quot;Marxism&quot; and failing to see the primary reason of political events, the personality of the leaders. During the rise of the &quot;revisionists&quot;, &quot;totalitarians&quot; retained popularity and influence outside academic circles, especially in politics and public spheres of the United States, where they supported harder policies towards the USSR: for example, Zbigniew Brzezinski served as National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter, while Richard Pipes headed the CIA group Team B; after 1991, their views have found popularity not only in the West, but also in the former USSR.

===Effect of the dissolution of the Soviet Union on historical research===
The dissolution of the Soviet Union affected historical interpretations of the October Revolution. Since 1991, increasing access to large amounts of Soviet archival materials has made it possible to re‑examine the October Revolution. Though both Western and Russian historians now have access to many of these archives, the effect of the dissolution of the USSR can be seen most clearly in the work of the latter. While the disintegration essentially helped solidify the Western and Revisionist views, post-USSR Russian historians largely repudiated the former Soviet historical interpretation of the Revolution. As Stephen Kotkin argues, 1991 prompted &quot;a return to political history and the apparent resurrection of totalitarianism, the interpretive view that, in different ways…revisionists sought to bury&quot;.

==Legacy==

The October Revolution marks the inception of the first communist government in Russia, and thus the first large-scale and constitutionally ordained socialist state in world history. After this, the Russian Republic became the Russian SFSR, which later became part of the Soviet Union.

The October Revolution also made the ideology of communism influential on a global scale in the 20th century. Communist parties would start to form in many countries after 1917.

&quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot;, a book written by American journalist John Reed and first published in 1919, gives a firsthand exposition of the events. Reed died in 1920, shortly after the book was finished.

Dmitri Shostakovich wrote his &quot;Symphony No. 2 in B major&quot;, Op. 14, and subtitled it &quot;To October&quot;, for the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution. The choral finale of the work, &quot;To October&quot;, is set to a text by Alexander Bezymensky, which praises Lenin and the revolution. The &quot;Symphony No. 2&quot; was first performed on 5 November 1927 by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra and the Academy Capella Choir under the direction of Nikolai Malko.

Sergei Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov&#x27;s film &quot;&quot;, first released on 20 January 1928 in the USSR and on 2 November 1928 in New York City, describes and glorifies the revolution, having been commissioned to commemorate the event.

The Hollywood film&quot;, Reds,&quot; released in 1981 was based on Reed&#x27;s account of the October Revolution and featured interviews with historical contemporaries from the period for the film.

The term &quot;Red October&quot; (Красный Октябрь, &quot;Krasnyy Oktyabr&quot;) has been used to signify the October Revolution. &quot;Red October&quot; was given to a steel factory that was made notable by the Battle of Stalingrad, a Moscow sweets factory that is well known in Russia, and a fictional Soviet submarine in both Tom Clancy&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; and the 1990 film adaptation of the same name.

The date 7 November, the anniversary of the October Revolution according to the Gregorian Calendar, was the official national day of the Soviet Union from 1918 onward and still is a public holiday in Belarus and the breakaway territory of Transnistria. Communist parties both in and out of power celebrate 7 November as the date Marxist parties began to take power.

The Russian Revolution was perceived as a rupture with imperialism for various civil rights and decolonization struggles and providing a space for oppressed groups across the world. This was given further credence with the Soviet Union supporting many anti-colonial third world movements with financial funds against European colonial powers.

<text>Opole Voivodeship ( , ), is the smallest and least populated voivodeship (province) of Poland. The province&#x27;s name derives from that of the region&#x27;s capital and largest city, Opole. It is part of Silesia. A relatively large German minority lives in the voivodeship, and the German language is co-official in 28 communes.

Opole Voivodeship is bordered by Lower Silesian Voivodeship to the west, Greater Poland and Łódź Voivodeships to the north, Silesian Voivodeship to the east, and the Czech Republic (Olomouc Region and Moravian-Silesian Region) to the south.

Opole Province&#x27;s geographic location, economic potential, and its population&#x27;s level of education make it an attractive business partner for other Polish regions (especially Lower Silesian and Silesian Voivodeships) and for foreign investors. Formed in 1997, the Praděd/Pradziad Euroregion with its headquarter in Prudnik has facilitated economic, cultural and tourist exchanges between the border areas of Poland and the Czech Republic.

==History==
The territory became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century, and later on, Brzeg, Namysłów, Niemodlin, Opole, Prudnik and Strzelce Opolskie were ducal seat of local lines of the Piast dynasty.

Opole Voivodeship was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former Opole Voivodeship and parts of Częstochowa Voivodeship, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.
Originally, the government, advised by prominent historians, had wanted to disestablish Opolskie and partition its territory between the Lower Silesian and Silesian Voivodeship (eastern Upper Silesia and western Lesser Poland). The plan was that Brzeg and Namysłów, as the Western part of the region, were to be transferred to Lower Silesia, while the rest was to become, along with a part of the Częstochowa Voivodeship, an integral part of the new &#x27;Silesian&#x27; region. However, the plans resulted in an outcry from the German minority population of Opole Voivodeship, who feared that should their region be abolished, they would lose all hope of regional representation (in the proposed Silesian Region, they would have formed a very small minority among a great number of ethnic Poles). To the surprise of many of the ethnic Germans in Opole however, the local Polish Silesian population and groups of ethnic Poles also rose up to oppose the planned reforms; this came about as a result of an overwhelming feeling of attachment to the voivodeships that were scheduled to be &#x27;redrawn&#x27;, as well as a fear of &#x27;alienation&#x27; should one find themselves residing in a new, unfamiliar region.

The solution came in late 1999, when Olesno was, after 24 years apart, finally reunited with the Opole Voivodeship to form the new legally defined region. A historic moment came in 2006 when the town of Radłów changed its local laws to make German, alongside Polish, the district&#x27;s second official language, becoming the first town in the region to do so.

==Geography==
The voivodeship lies in southwestern Poland, the major part on the Silesian Lowland (). To the east, the region touches upon the Silesian Upland (Silesian Uplands, ) with the famous Saint Anne Mountain; the Sudetes range, the Opawskie Mountains, lies to the southwest. The Oder River cuts across the middle of the voivodeship. The northern part of the voivodeship, along the Mała Panew River, is densely forested, while the southern part consists of arable land.

The region has the warmest climate in the country.

===Protected areas===
Protected areas in Opole Voivodeship include the following three areas designated as Landscape Parks:
*Opawskie Mountains Landscape Park
*Góra Świętej Anny Landscape Park
*Stobrawa Landscape Park

===Climate===

==Demographics==
The Opole Voivodeship is the smallest region in the administrative makeup of the country in terms of both area and population.

About 15% of the one million inhabitants of this voivodeship are ethnic Germans, which constitutes 90% of all ethnic Germans in Poland. Towns with particularly high concentrations of German speakers include: Strzelce Opolskie; Dobrodzien; Prudnik; Głogówek; and Gogolin. As a result, many areas are officially bilingual and the German language and culture play a significant role in education in the region. Ethnic Germans first came to this region during the Late Middle Ages. The area was once part of the Prussian province of Silesia. 

==Economy==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 10.1 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.0% of Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 17,000 euros or 56% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 66% of the EU average.

The Opole Voivodeship is an industrial as well as an agricultural region. With respect to mineral resources, of major importance are deposits of raw materials for building: limestone (Strzelce Opolskie), marl (near Opole), marble, and basalt. The favourable climate, fertile soils, and high farming culture contribute to the development of agriculture, which is among the most productive in the country.

A total of nineteen industries are represented in the voivodeship. The most important are cement and lime, furniture, food, car manufacturing, and chemical industries. In 1997, the biggest production growth in the area was in companies producing wood and wood products, electrical equipment, machinery and appliances, as well as cellulose and paper products. In 1997, the top company in the region was Zakłady Azotowe S.A. in Kędzierzyn-Koźle, whose income was over PLN 860 million. The voivodship&#x27;s economy consists of more than 53,000 businesses, mostly small and medium-sized, employing over 332,000 people. Manufacturing companies employ over 89,000 people; 95.7% of all the region&#x27;s business operate in the private sector.

===Tourism===
The Opole Voivodeship is a green region with three large lakes: Turawskie, Nyskie, and Otmuchów (the latter two are connected). The Opawskie Mountains between Prudnik and Głuchołazy are extremely popular. The region also includes the castle in Brzeg, built during the reign of the Piast dynasty—pearl of the Silesian Renaissance, the Franciscan monastery on top of Góra Świętej Anny (Saint Anne Mountain), as well as the medieval old town and defence fortifications in Paczków (referred to as the Polish Carcassonne), all designated Historic Monument of Poland. Kamień Śląski with its Baroque palace hosts a sanctuary dedicated to Saint Hyacinth of Poland, who was born in the village. Other landmark palaces are located in Moszna, Narok, Żyrowa, castles in Namysłów, Niemodlin, Otmuchów, Prószków, and the preserved medieval Piast Tower in Opole.

There are several World War II memorials in the voivodeship, including at the site of the Blechhammer concentration camp and Stalag VIII-B prisoner-of-war camp, and at sites of German-perpetrated massacres. The village of Popielów hosts a small cemetery of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, where two British soldiers are buried, who as prisoners-of-war were killed by a German guard during forced labour.

<text>Old Norse, also referred to as Old Nordic or Old Scandinavian, was a stage of development of North Germanic dialects before their final divergence into separate Nordic languages. Old Norse was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and their overseas settlements and chronologically coincides with the Viking Age, the Christianization of Scandinavia, and the consolidation of Scandinavian kingdoms from about the 8th to the 15th centuries.

The Proto-Norse language developed into Old Norse by the 8th century, and Old Norse began to develop into the modern North Germanic languages in the mid- to late 14th century, ending the language phase known as Old Norse. These dates, however, are not precise, since written Old Norse is found well into the 15th century.

Old Norse was divided into three dialects: Old West Norse (Old West Nordic, often referred to as &quot;Old Norse&quot;), Old East Norse (Old East Nordic), and Old Gutnish. Old West Norse and Old East Norse formed a dialect continuum, with no clear geographical boundary between them. Old East Norse traits were found in eastern Norway, although Old Norwegian is classified as Old West Norse, and Old West Norse traits were found in western Sweden. In what is present-day Denmark and Sweden, most speakers spoke Old East Norse. Though Old Gutnish is sometimes included in the Old East Norse dialect due to geographical associations, it developed its own unique features and shared in changes to both other branches.

The 12th-century Icelandic &quot;Gray Goose Laws&quot; state that Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, and Danes spoke the same language, (&quot;Danish tongue&quot;; speakers of Old East Norse would have said &quot;&quot;). Another term was (&quot;northern speech&quot;). Today Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, and other North Germanic varieties with which Norwegian, Danish and Swedish retain considerable mutual intelligibility. Icelandic remains the most conservative language, such that in present-day Iceland, schoolchildren are able to read the 12th-century Icelandic sagas in the original language (in editions with latinised spelling).

== Geographical distribution ==

Old Icelandic was very close to Old Norwegian, and together they formed Old West Norse, which was also spoken in Norse settlements in Greenland, the Faroes, Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Man, northwest England, and in Normandy. Old East Norse was spoken in Denmark, Sweden, Kievan Rus&#x27;, eastern England, and Danish settlements in Normandy. The Old Gutnish dialect was spoken in Gotland and in various settlements in the East.

In the 11th century, Old Norse was the most widely spoken European language, ranging from Vinland in the West to the Volga River in the East. In Kievan Rus&#x27;, it survived the longest in Veliky Novgorod, probably lasting into the 13th century there. The age of the Swedish-speaking population of Finland is strongly contested, but Swedish settlement had spread the language into the region by the time of the Second Swedish Crusade in the 13th century at the latest.

== Modern descendants ==
The modern descendants of the Old West Norse dialect are the West Scandinavian languages of Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, and the extinct Norn language of Orkney and Shetland, although Norwegian was heavily influenced by the East dialect, and is today more similar to East Scandinavian (Danish and Swedish) than to Icelandic and Faroese. The descendants of the Old East Norse dialect are the East Scandinavian languages of Danish and Swedish.

Among these, the grammar of Icelandic and Faroese have changed the least from Old Norse in the last thousand years, though their pronunciations both have changed considerably from Old Norse. With Danish rule of the Faroe Islands, Faroese has also been influenced by Danish.

Both Middle English (especially northern English dialects within the area of the Danelaw) and Early Scots (including Lowland Scots) were strongly influenced by Norse and contained many Old Norse loanwords. Consequently, Modern English (including Scottish English), inherited a significant proportion of its vocabulary directly from Norse.

The development of Norman French was also influenced by Norse. Through Norman, to a smaller extent, so was modern French.

Written modern Icelandic derives from the Old Norse phonemic writing system. Contemporary Icelandic-speakers can read Old Norse, which varies slightly in spelling as well as semantics and word order. However, pronunciation, particularly of the vowel phonemes, has changed at least as much in Icelandic as in the other North Germanic languages.

Faroese retains many similarities but is influenced by Danish, Norwegian, and Gaelic (Scottish and/or Irish). Although Swedish, Danish and Norwegian have diverged the most, they still retain considerable mutual intelligibility. Speakers of modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish can mostly understand each other without studying their neighboring languages, particularly if speaking slowly. The languages are also sufficiently similar in writing that they can mostly be understood across borders. This could be because these languages have been mutually affected by each other, as well as having a similar development influenced by Middle Low German.

=== Other influenced languages ===
Various languages unrelated to Old Norse and others not closely related have been heavily influenced by Norse, particularly the Norman language; to a lesser extent, Finnish and Estonian. Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Lithuanian and Latvian also have a few Norse loanwords. The words &quot;Rus&quot; and &quot;Russia&quot;, according to one theory, may be named after the Rus&#x27; people, a Norse tribe, probably from present-day east-central Sweden. The current Finnish and Estonian words for Sweden are and , respectively.

A number of loanwords have been introduced into Irish, many associated with fishing and sailing. A similar influence is found in Scottish Gaelic, with over one hundred loanwords estimated to be in the language, many of which are related to fishing and sailing.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Old Norse vowel phonemes mostly come in pairs of long and short. The standardized orthography marks the long vowels with an acute accent. In medieval manuscripts, it is often unmarked but sometimes marked with an accent or through gemination.

Old Norse had nasalized versions of all ten vowel places. These occurred as allophones of the vowels before nasal consonants and in places where a nasal had followed it in an older form of the word, before it was absorbed into a neighboring sound. If the nasal was absorbed by a stressed vowel, it would also lengthen the vowel. This nasalization also occurred in the other Germanic languages, but were not retained long. They were noted in the First Grammatical Treatise, and otherwise might have remained unknown. The First Grammarian marked these with a dot above the letter. This notation did not catch on, and would soon be obsolete. Nasal and oral vowels probably merged around the 11th century in most of Old East Norse. However, the distinction still holds in Dalecarlian dialects. The dots in the following vowel table separate the oral from nasal phonemes.

Note: The open or open-mid vowels may be transcribed differently:
* = 

Sometime around the 13th century, (spelled ) merged with or in most dialects except Old Danish, and Icelandic where () merged with . This can be determined by their distinction within the 12th-century First Grammatical Treatise but not within the early 13th-century Prose Edda. The nasal vowels, also noted in the First Grammatical Treatise, are assumed to have been lost in most dialects by this time (but notably they are retained in Elfdalian and other dialects of Ovansiljan). See Old Icelandic for the mergers of (spelled ) with (spelled ) and (spelled ) with (spelled ).

Old Norse had three diphthong phonemes: , , (spelled , , respectively). In East Norse these would monophthongize and merge with and , whereas in West Norse and its descendants the diphthongs remained.

=== Consonants ===
Old Norse has six plosive phonemes, being rare word-initially and and pronounced as voiced fricative allophones between vowels except in compound words (e.g. ), already in the Proto-Germanic language (e.g. &gt; between vowels). The phoneme was pronounced as after an or another and as before and . Some accounts have it a voiced velar fricative in all cases, and others have that realisation only in the middle of words and between vowels (with it otherwise being realised ). The Old East Norse was an apical consonant, with its precise position unknown; it is reconstructed as a palatal sibilant. It descended from Proto-Germanic and eventually developed into , as had already occurred in Old West Norse.


The consonant digraphs , , and occurred word-initially. It is unclear whether they were sequences of two consonants (with the first element realised as or perhaps ) or as single voiceless sonorants , and respectively. In Old Norwegian, Old Danish and later Old Swedish, the groups , , and were reduced to plain , , , which suggests that they had most likely already been pronounced as voiceless sonorants by Old Norse times.

The pronunciation of is unclear, but it may have been (the Proto-Germanic pronunciation), or the similar phoneme . Unlike the three other digraphs, it was retained much longer in all dialects. Without ever developing into a voiceless sonorant in Icelandic, it instead underwent fortition to a plosive , which suggests that instead of being a voiceless sonorant, it retained a stronger frication.

=== Accent ===

Primary stress in Old Norse falls on the word stem, so that would be pronounced . In compound words, secondary stress falls on the second stem (e.g. , ).

== Orthography ==

Unlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the Elder Futhark, runic Old Norse was originally written with the Younger Futhark, which had only 16 letters. Because of the limited number of runes, several runes were used for different sounds, and long and short vowels were not distinguished in writing. Medieval runes came into use some time later.

As for the Latin alphabet, there was no standardized orthography in use in the Middle Ages. A modified version of the letter wynn called vend was used briefly for the sounds , , and . Long vowels were sometimes marked with acutes but also sometimes left unmarked or geminated. The standardized Old Norse spelling was created in the 19th century and is, for the most part, phonemic. The most notable deviation is that the nonphonemic difference between the voiced and the voiceless dental fricative is marked. The oldest texts and runic inscriptions use &quot;þ&quot; exclusively. Long vowels are denoted with acutes. Most other letters are written with the same glyph as the IPA phoneme, except as shown in the table below.

== Phonological processes ==
=== Ablaut ===
Ablaut patterns are groups of vowels which are swapped, or &quot;ablauted,&quot; in the nucleus of a word. Strong verbs ablaut the lemma&#x27;s nucleus to derive the past forms of the verb. This parallels English conjugation, where, e.g., the nucleus of &quot;sing&quot; becomes &quot;sang&quot; in the past tense and &quot;sung&quot; in the past participle. Some verbs are derived by ablaut, as the present-in-past verbs do by consequence of being derived from the past tense forms of strong verbs.

=== Umlaut ===
Umlaut or mutation is an assimilatory process acting on vowels preceding a vowel or semivowel of a different vowel backness. In the case of &quot;i-umlaut&quot; and &quot;ʀ-umlaut&quot;, this entails a fronting of back vowels, with retention of lip rounding. In the case of &quot;u-umlaut&quot;, this entails labialization of unrounded vowels. Umlaut is phonemic and in many situations grammatically significant as a side effect of losing the Proto-Germanic morphological suffixes whose vowels created the umlaut allophones.

Some , , , , , , , and all were obtained by i-umlaut from , , , , , , , and respectively. Others were formed via ʀ-umlaut from , , , , and .

 was obtained through a simultaneous u- and i-umlaut of . It appears in words like &quot;&quot; (&#x27;, &#x27;), from Proto-Germanic , and commonly in verbs with a velar consonant before the suffix like &quot;&quot; &lt; &quot;&quot;.

OEN often preserves the original value of the vowel directly preceding runic while OWN receives ʀ-umlaut. Compare runic OEN &#x27; with OWN &#x27; (later &#x27;), &#x27; (&quot;glass&quot;, &quot;hare&quot;, &quot;pile of rocks&quot;).

==== U-umlaut ====
U-umlaut is more common in Old West Norse in both phonemic and allophonic positions, while it only occurs sparsely in post-runic Old East Norse and even in runic Old East Norse.

: Old Swedish orthography uses to represent both and . The change from Norse to Old Swedish represents only a change in orthography rather than a change in sound. Similarly is used in place of . And thus changes from Norse to Old Swedish to Swedish should be viewed as a change in orthography.
: Represents the u-umlaut found in Swedish.

This is still a major difference between Swedish and Faroese and Icelandic today. Plurals of neuters do not have u-umlaut at all in Swedish, but in Faroese and Icelandic they do, for example the Faroese and Icelandic plurals of the word , and respectively, in contrast to the Swedish plural and numerous other examples. That also applies to almost all feminine nouns, for example the largest feminine noun group, the o-stem nouns (except the Swedish noun mentioned above), and even i-stem nouns and root nouns, such as Old West Norse (&quot;mörk&quot; in Icelandic) in comparison with Modern and Old Swedish .

=== Breaking ===
Vowel breaking, or fracture, caused a front vowel to be split into a semivowel-vowel sequence before a back vowel in the following syllable. While West Norse only broke , East Norse also broke . The change was blocked by a , , or preceding the potentially-broken vowel.

Some or and or result from breaking of and respectively.

=== Assimilation or elision of inflectional &quot;ʀ&quot; ===
When a noun, pronoun, adjective, or verb has a long vowel or diphthong in the accented syllable and its stem ends in a single &quot;l&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, or &quot;s&quot;, the &quot;r&quot; (or the elder &quot;r&quot;- or &quot;z&quot;-variant &quot;ʀ&quot;) in an ending is assimilated. When the accented vowel is short, the ending is dropped.

The nominative of the strong masculine declension and some i-stem feminine nouns uses one such -r (ʀ). () becomes instead of ().

The verb (&#x27;to blow&#x27;), has third person present tense &#x27; (&#x27;[he] blows&#x27;) rather than (). Similarly, the verb (&#x27;to shine&#x27;) had present tense third person &#x27; (rather than , ); while (&#x27;to cool down&#x27;) had present tense third person (rather than , ).

The rule is not absolute, with certain counter-examples such as (&#x27;friend&#x27;), which has the synonym , yet retains the unabsorbed version, and (&#x27;giant&#x27;), where assimilation takes place even though the root vowel, , is short.

The clusters cannot yield respectively, instead . The effect of this shortening can result in the lack of distinction between some forms of the noun. In the case of (&#x27;winter&#x27;), the nominative and accusative singular and plural forms are identical. The nominative singular and nominative and accusative plural would otherwise have been , . These forms are impossible because the cluster cannot be realized as , nor as , nor as . The same shortening as in also occurs in &#x27; = (&#x27;salmon&#x27;) (as opposed to , ), &#x27; (&#x27;bottom&#x27;) (as opposed to , ), and (as opposed to , ).

Furthermore, wherever the cluster is expected to exist, such as in the male names , (supposedly , ), the result is apparently always rather than or . This is observable in the Runic corpus.

== Phonotactics ==
=== Blocking of ii, uu ===
In Old Norse, adjacent to , , their u-umlauts, and was not possible, nor adjacent to , , their i-umlauts, and . At the beginning of words, this manifested as a dropping of the initial (which was general, independent of the following vowel) or . Compare ON , , with English &quot;word, wolf, year&quot;. In inflections, this manifested as the dropping of the inflectional vowels. Thus, + remains , and in Icelandic progressed to &gt; &gt; . The and of Proto-Germanic became and respectively in Old Norse, a change known as Holtzmann&#x27;s law.

=== Epenthesis ===
An epenthetic vowel became popular by 1200 in Old Danish, 1250 in Old Swedish and Old Norwegian, and 1300 in Old Icelandic. An unstressed vowel was used which varied by dialect. Old Norwegian exhibited all three: was used in West Norwegian south of Bergen, as in , (older &quot;&quot;); North of Bergen, appeared in , ; and East Norwegian used , , .

== Grammar ==
Old Norse was a moderately inflected language with high levels of nominal and verbal inflection. Most of the fused morphemes are retained in modern Icelandic, especially in regard to noun case declensions, whereas modern Norwegian in comparison has moved towards more analytical word structures.

=== Gender ===
Old Norse had three grammatical genders – masculine, feminine, and neuter. Adjectives or pronouns referring to a noun must mirror the gender of that noun, so that one says, &quot; but, &quot;. As in other languages, the grammatical gender of an impersonal noun is generally unrelated to an expected natural gender of that noun. While indeed , &quot;man&quot; is masculine, , &quot;woman&quot;, is feminine, and , &quot;house&quot;, is neuter, so also are and , for &quot;raven&quot; and &quot;crow&quot;, masculine and feminine respectively, even in reference to a female raven or a male crow.

All neuter words have identical nominative and accusative forms, and all feminine words have identical nominative and accusative plurals.

The gender of some words&#x27; plurals does not agree with that of their singulars, such as and . Some words, such as , have multiple genders, evidenced by their determiners being declined in different genders within a given sentence.

=== Morphology ===

Nouns, adjectives, and pronouns were declined in four grammatical casesnominative, accusative, genitive, and dativein singular and plural numbers. Adjectives and pronouns were additionally declined in three grammatical genders. Some pronouns (first and second person) could have dual number in addition to singular and plural. The genitive was used partitively and in compounds and kennings (e.g., , the well of Urðr; , the gibing of Loki).

There were several classes of nouns within each gender. The following is an example of the &quot;strong&quot; inflectional paradigms:



The numerous &quot;weak&quot; noun paradigms had a much higher degree of syncretism between the different cases; i.e. they had fewer forms than the &quot;strong&quot; nouns.

A definite article was realised as a suffix that retained an independent declension; e.g., (&quot;a troll&quot;) – (&quot;the troll&quot;), (&quot;a hall&quot;) – (&quot;the hall&quot;), (&quot;an arm&quot;) – (&quot;the arm&quot;). This definite article, however, was a separate word and did not become attached to the noun before later stages of the Old Norse period.

== Texts ==

The earliest inscriptions in Old Norse are runic, from the 8th century. Runes continued to be commonly used until the 15th century and have been recorded to be in use in some form as late as the 19th century in some parts of Sweden. With the conversion to Christianity in the 11th century came the Latin alphabet. The oldest preserved texts in Old Norse in the Latin alphabet date from the middle of the 12th century. Subsequently, Old Norse became the vehicle of a large and varied body of vernacular literature. Most of the surviving literature was written in Iceland. Best known are the Norse sagas, the Icelanders&#x27; sagas and the mythological literature, but there also survives a large body of religious literature, translations into Old Norse of courtly romances, classical mythology, and the Old Testament, as well as instructional material, grammatical treatises and a large body of letters and official documents.

== Dialects ==
Most of the innovations that appeared in Old Norse spread evenly through the Old Norse area. As a result, the dialects were very similar and considered to be the same language, a language that they sometimes called the Danish tongue (), sometimes Norse language (), as evidenced in the following two quotes from by Snorri Sturluson:

However, some changes were geographically limited and so created a dialectal difference between Old West Norse and Old East Norse.

As Proto-Norse evolved into Old Norse, in the 8th century, the effects of the umlauts seem to have been very much the same over the whole Old Norse area. But in later dialects of the language a split occurred mainly between west and east as the use of umlauts began to vary. The typical umlauts (for example from ) were better preserved in the West due to later generalizations in the east where many instances of umlaut were removed (many archaic Eastern texts as well as eastern runic inscriptions however portray the same extent of umlauts as in later Western Old Norse).

All the while, the changes resulting in breaking (for example from ) were more influential in the East probably once again due to generalizations within the inflectional system. This difference was one of the greatest reasons behind the dialectalization that took place in the 9th and 10th centuries, shaping an Old West Norse dialect in Norway and the Atlantic settlements and an Old East Norse dialect in Denmark and Sweden.

Old West Norse and Old Gutnish did not take part in the monophthongization which changed () into , () and into , nor did certain peripheral dialects of Swedish, as seen in modern Ostrobothnian dialects. Another difference was that Old West Norse lost certain combinations of consonants. The combinations , , and were assimilated into , and in Old West Norse, but this phenomenon was limited in Old East Norse.

Here is a comparison between the two dialects as well as Old Gutnish. It is a transcription from one of the Funbo Runestones in Sweden (U 990) from the eleventh century:

The OEN original text above is transliterated according to traditional scholarly methods, wherein u-umlaut is not regarded in runic Old East Norse. Modern studies have shown that the positions where it applies are the same as for runic Old West Norse. An alternative and probably more accurate transliteration would therefore render the text in OEN as such:
Some past participles and other words underwent i-umlaut in Old West Norse but not in Old East Norse dialects. Examples of that are Icelandic and , which in Swedish are slagit/slagen and tagit/tagen. This can also be seen in the Icelandic and Norwegian words sterkur and sterk (&quot;strong&quot;), which in Swedish is stark as in Old Swedish. These differences can also be seen in comparison between Norwegian and Swedish.

=== Old West Norse ===
Old West Norse is by far the best attested variety of Old Norse. The term &quot;Old Norse&quot; is often used to refer to Old West Norse specifically, in which case the broader subject receives another name, such as &quot;Old Scandinavian&quot;. Another designation is Old West Nordic.

The combinations , , and mostly merged to , and in Old West Norse around the 7th century, marking the first distinction between the Eastern and Western dialects. The following table illustrates this:

An early difference between Old West Norse and the other dialects was that Old West Norse had the forms , &quot;dwelling&quot;, , &quot;cow&quot; (accusative) and , &quot;faith&quot;, whereas Old East Norse , and . Old West Norse was also characterized by the preservation of &quot;u&quot;-umlaut, which meant that, for example, Proto-Norse , &quot;tooth&quot;, became and not as in post-runic Old East Norse; OWN and runic OEN , while post-runic OEN &quot;goose&quot;.

The earliest body of text appears in runic inscriptions and in poems composed by Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (although the poems are not preserved in contemporary sources, but only in much later manuscripts). The earliest manuscripts are from the period 1150–1200 and concern legal, religious and historical matters. During the 12th and 13th centuries, Trøndelag and Western Norway were the most important areas of the Norwegian kingdom and they shaped Old West Norse as an archaic language with a rich set of declensions. In the body of text that has survived into the modern day from until , Old West Norse had little dialect variation, and Old Icelandic does not diverge much more than the Old Norwegian dialects do from each other.

Old Norwegian differentiated early from Old Icelandic by the loss of the consonant &quot;h&quot; in initial position before &quot;l&quot;, &quot;n&quot; and &quot;r&quot;; thus whereas Old Icelandic manuscripts might use the form , &quot;fist&quot;, Old Norwegian manuscripts might use .

From the late 13th century, Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian started to diverge more. After , the Black Death and following social upheavals seem to have accelerated language changes in Norway. From the late 14th century, the language used in Norway is generally referred to as Middle Norwegian.

Old West Norse underwent a lengthening of initial vowels at some point, especially in Norwegian, so that OWN became , ONW &gt; , OIC &gt; .

==== Old Icelandic ====
In Iceland, initial before was lost: compare Icelandic &quot;&quot; with Danish , OEN . The change is shared with Old Gutnish.

A specifically Icelandic sound, the long, &quot;u&quot;-umlauted A, spelled and pronounced , developed around the early 11th century. It was short-lived, being marked in the Grammatical Treatises and remaining until the end of the 12th century. It then merged back into ; as a result, long A is not affected by &quot;u&quot;-umlaut in Modern Icelandic.

 merged with during the 12th century, which caused to become an independent phoneme from and the written distinction of for from medial and final to become merely etymological.

Around the 13th century, (, which had probably already lowered to ) merged to (). Thus, pre-13th-century (with ) &#x27;green&#x27; became spelled as in modern Icelandic (with ). The 12th-century Gray Goose Laws manuscripts distinguish the vowels, and so does the Codex Regius copy. However, the 13th-century Codex Regius copy of the Poetic Edda probably relied on newer or poorer quality sources, or both. Demonstrating either difficulty with or total lack of natural distinction, the manuscripts show separation of the two phonemes in some places, but they frequently confuse the letters chosen to distinguish them in others.

Towards the end of the 13th century, () merged to ().

==== Old Norwegian ====
Around the 11th century, Old Norwegian , , and became , and . It is debatable whether the sequences represented a consonant cluster () or devoicing ().

Orthographic evidence suggests that in a confined dialect of Old Norwegian, may have been unrounded before and that &quot;u&quot;-umlaut was reversed unless the &quot;u&quot; had been eliminated: , &gt; , .

==== Greenlandic Norse ====
This dialect of Old West Norse was spoken by Icelandic colonies in Greenland. When the colonies died out around the 15th century, the dialect went with it. The phoneme and some instances of merged to and so Old Icelandic became .

==== Text example ====
The following text is from , an Alexander romance. The manuscript, AM 519 a 4to, is dated . The facsimile demonstrates the sigla used by scribes to write Old Norse. Many of them were borrowed from Latin. Without familiarity with these abbreviations, the facsimile will be unreadable to many. In addition, reading the manuscript itself requires familiarity with the letterforms of the native script. The abbreviations are expanded in a version with normalized spelling like that of the standard normalization system. Compared to the spelling of the same text in Modern Icelandic, pronunciation has changed greatly, but spelling has changed little since Icelandic orthography was intentionally modelled after Old Norse in the 19th century.

=== Old East Norse ===
Old East Norse or Old East Nordic between 800 and 1100 is called &quot;Runic Swedish&quot; in Sweden and &quot;Runic Danish&quot; in Denmark, but for geographical rather than linguistic reasons. Any differences between the two were minute at best during the more ancient stages of this dialect group. Changes had a tendency to occur earlier in the Danish region. Even today many Old Danish changes have still not taken place in modern Swedish. Swedish is therefore the more conservative of the two in both the ancient and the modern languages, sometimes by a profound margin. The language is called &quot;runic&quot; because the body of text appears in runes.

Runic Old East Norse is characteristically conservative in form, especially Swedish (which is still true for modern Swedish compared to Danish). In essence it matches or surpasses the conservatism of post-runic Old West Norse, which in turn is generally more conservative than post-runic Old East Norse. While typically &quot;Eastern&quot; in structure, many later post-runic changes and trademarks of OEN had yet to happen.

The phoneme &quot;ʀ&quot;, which evolved during the Proto-Norse period from &quot;z&quot;, was still clearly separated from &quot;r&quot; in most positions, even when being geminated, while in OWN it had already merged with &quot;r&quot;.

The Proto-Germanic phoneme was preserved in initial sounds in Old East Norse (w-), unlike in West Norse where it developed into . It survived in rural Swedish dialects in the provinces of Westro- and North Bothnia, Skåne, Blekinge, Småland, Halland, Västergötland and south of Bohuslän into the 18th, 19th and 20th century. It is still preserved in the Dalecarlian dialects in the province of Dalarna, Sweden, and in Jutlandic dialects in Denmark. The -phoneme did also occur after consonants (kw-, tw-, sw- etc.) in Old East Norse and did so into modern times in said Swedish dialects and in a number of others. Generally, the initial w-sound developed into in dialects earlier than after consonants where it survived much longer.

In summation, the -sound survived in the East Nordic tongues almost a millennium longer than in the West Norse counterparts, and does still subsist at the present.

Monophthongization of &gt; and &gt; started in mid-10th-century Denmark. Compare runic OEN: , , , , ; with Post-runic OEN: , , , , ; OWN: &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, , ; from PN , , , + &#x27;maidendom; virginity&#x27;, &#x27;(wild) animal&#x27;.

Feminine o-stems often preserve the plural ending , while in OWN they more often merge with the feminine i-stems: (runic OEN) , , , versus OWN , and (modern Swedish , , (&quot;suns, havens, scales&quot;); Danish has mainly lost the distinction between the two stems, with both endings now being rendered as or alternatively for the o-stems).

Vice versa, masculine i-stems with the root ending in either or tended to shift the plural ending to that of the ja-stems while OEN kept the original: , and versus OWN &quot;&quot;, (&quot;elks&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (modern Danish &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, modern Swedish &quot;&quot;, , ).

The plural ending of ja-stems were mostly preserved while those of OWN often acquired that of the i-stems: , , versus OWN (&quot;beds&quot;), &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; (modern Swedish , , ).

==== Old Danish ====

Until the early 12th century, Old East Norse was very much a uniform dialect. It was in Denmark that the first innovations appeared that would differentiate Old Danish from Old Swedish () as these innovations spread north unevenly (unlike the earlier changes that spread more evenly over the East Norse area), creating a series of isoglosses going from Zealand to Svealand.

In Old Danish, merged with during the 9th century. From the 11th to 14th centuries, the unstressed vowels -&quot;a&quot;, -&quot;o&quot; and -&quot;e&quot; (standard normalization -&quot;a&quot;, -&quot;u&quot; and -&quot;i&quot;) started to merge into -&quot;ə&quot;, represented with the letter . This vowel came to be epenthetic, particularly before &quot;-ʀ&quot; endings. At the same time, the voiceless stop consonants &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot; became voiced plosives and even fricative consonants. Resulting from these innovations, Danish has (cake), (tongues) and (guests) whereas (Standard) Swedish has retained older forms, , and (OEN , , ).

Moreover, the Danish pitch accent shared with Norwegian and Swedish changed into &quot;stød&quot; around this time.

==== Old Swedish ====

At the end of the 10th and early 11th century initial &quot;h-&quot; before &quot;l&quot;, &quot;n&quot; and &quot;r&quot; was still preserved in the middle and northern parts of Sweden, and is sporadically still preserved in some northern dialects as &quot;g-&quot;, e.g. (lukewarm), from . The Dalecarlian dialects developed independently from Old Swedish and as such can be considered separate languages from Swedish.

==== Text example ====
This is an extract from , the Westrogothic law. It is the oldest text written as a manuscript found in Sweden and from the 13th century. It is contemporaneous with most of the Icelandic literature. The text marks the beginning of Old Swedish as a distinct dialect.
=== Old Gutnish ===

Due to Gotland&#x27;s early isolation from the mainland, many features of Old Norse did not spread from or to the island, and Old Gutnish developed as an entirely separate branch from Old East and West Norse. For example, the diphthong in , and was not subject to anticipatory assimilation to as in e.g. Old Icelandic , and . Gutnish also shows dropping of in initial , which it shares with the Old West Norse dialects (except Old East Norwegian), but which is otherwise abnormal. Breaking was also particularly active in Old Gutnish, leading to e.g. versus mainland .

==== Text example ====
The is the longest text surviving from Old Gutnish. Appended to it is a short texting dealing with the history of the Gotlanders. This part relates to the agreement that the Gotlanders had with the Swedish king sometime before the 9th century:

== Relationship to other languages ==
=== Relationship to English ===
Old English and Old Norse were related languages. It is therefore not surprising that many words in Old Norse look familiar to English speakers; e.g., (arm), (foot), (land), (full), (to hang), (to stand). This is because both English and Old Norse stem from a Proto-Germanic mother language. In addition, numerous common, everyday Old Norse words were adopted into the Old English language during the Viking Age. A few examples of Old Norse loanwords in modern English are (English/Viking Age Old East Norse), in some cases even displacing their Old English cognates:
* Nouns – &quot;anger&quot; (), &quot;bag&quot; (), &quot;bait&quot; (, , ), &quot;band&quot; (), &quot;bark&quot; (, stem ), &quot;birth&quot; (), &quot;dirt&quot; (), &quot;dregs&quot; (), &quot;egg&quot; (, related to OE. cognate which became Middle English /), &quot;fellow&quot; (), &quot;gap&quot; (), &quot;husband&quot; (), &quot;cake&quot; (), &quot;keel&quot; (, stem also , ), &quot;kid&quot; (), &quot;knife&quot; (), &quot;law&quot; (, stem ), &quot;leg&quot; (), &quot;link&quot; (), &quot;loan&quot; (, related to OE. cognate , cf. lend), &quot;race&quot; (, stem ), &quot;root&quot; (, related to OE. cognate , cf. wort), &quot;sale&quot; (), &quot;scrap&quot; (), &quot;seat&quot; (), &quot;sister&quot; (, related to OE. cognate ), &quot;skill&quot; (/), &quot;skin&quot; (), &quot;skirt&quot; ( vs. the native English &quot;shirt&quot; of the same root), &quot;sky&quot; (), &quot;slaughter&quot; (), &quot;snare&quot; (), &quot;steak&quot; (), &quot;thrift&quot; (), &quot;tidings&quot; (), &quot;trust&quot; (), &quot;window&quot; (), &quot;wing&quot; ()
* Verbs – &quot;are&quot; (, displacing OE ), &quot;blend&quot; (), &quot;call&quot; (), &quot;cast&quot; (), &quot;clip&quot; (), &quot;crawl&quot; (), &quot;cut&quot; (possibly from ON ), &quot;die&quot; (), &quot;gasp&quot; (), &quot;get&quot; (), &quot;give&quot; (/, related to OE. cognate ), &quot;glitter&quot; (), &quot;hit&quot; (), &quot;lift&quot; (), &quot;raise&quot; (), &quot;ransack&quot; (), &quot;rid&quot; (), &quot;run&quot; (, stem , related to OE. cognate ), &quot;scare&quot; (), &quot;scrape&quot; (), &quot;seem&quot; (), &quot;sprint&quot; (), &quot;take&quot; (), &quot;thrive&quot; (), &quot;thrust&quot; (), &quot;want&quot; ()
* Adjectives – &quot;flat&quot; (), &quot;happy&quot; (), &quot;ill&quot; (), &quot;likely&quot; (), &quot;loose&quot; (), &quot;low&quot; (), &quot;meek&quot; (), &quot;odd&quot; (), &quot;rotten&quot; (/), &quot;scant&quot; (), &quot;sly&quot; (), &quot;weak&quot; (), &quot;wrong&quot; ()
* Adverbs – &quot;thwart/athwart&quot; ()
* Prepositions – &quot;till&quot; (), &quot;fro&quot; ()
* Conjunction – though/tho ()
* Interjection – &quot;hail&quot; (), &quot;wassail&quot; ()
* Personal pronoun – &quot;they&quot; (), &quot;their&quot; (), &quot;them&quot; () (for which the Anglo-Saxons said , , )
* Prenominal adjectives – &quot;same&quot; ()

In a simple sentence like &quot;They are both weak&quot;, the extent of the Old Norse loanwords becomes quite clear (Old East Norse with archaic pronunciation: while Old English ). The words &quot;they&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; are both borrowed from Old Norse, and the word &quot;both&quot; might also be a borrowing, though this is disputed (cf. German ). While the number of loanwords adopted from the Norse was not as numerous as that of Norman French or Latin, their depth and everyday nature make them a substantial and very important part of everyday English speech as they are part of the very core of the modern English vocabulary.

Tracing the origins of words like &quot;bull&quot; and &quot;Thursday&quot; is more difficult. &quot;Bull&quot; may derive from either Old English or Old Norse , while &quot;Thursday&quot; may be a borrowing or simply derive from the Old English , which could have been influenced by the Old Norse cognate. The word &quot;are&quot; is from Old English /, which stems back to Proto-Germanic as well as the Old Norse cognates.

<text>Old English ( or , or ), or Anglo-Saxon, was the earliest recorded form of the English language, spoken in England and southern and eastern Scotland in the Early Middle Ages. It developed from the languages brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the mid-5th century, and the first Old English literature dates from the mid-7th century. After the Norman Conquest of 1066, English was replaced for several centuries by Anglo-Norman (a type of French) as the language of the upper classes. This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era, since during the subsequent period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into what is now known as Middle English in England and Early Scots in Scotland.

Old English developed from a set of Anglo-Frisian or Ingvaeonic dialects originally spoken by Germanic tribes traditionally known as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes. As the Germanic settlers became dominant in England, their language replaced the languages of Roman Britain: Common Brittonic, a Celtic language; and Latin, brought to Britain by the Roman conquest. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: Kentish, Mercian, Northumbrian, and West Saxon. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period, although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian, and Scots from Northumbrian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong Old Norse influence due to Scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century.

Old English is one of the West Germanic languages, with its closest relatives being Old Frisian and Old Saxon. Like other old Germanic languages, it is very different from Modern English and Modern Scots, and largely incomprehensible for Modern English or Modern Scots speakers without study. Within Old English grammar nouns, adjectives, pronouns and verbs have many inflectional endings and forms, and word order is much freer. The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a runic system, but from about the 8th century this was replaced by a version of the Latin alphabet.

== Etymology ==
, from which the word &quot;English&quot; is derived, means &#x27;pertaining to the Angles&#x27;. The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes who settled in many parts of Britain in the 5th century. By the 9th century, all speakers of Old English, including those who claimed Saxon or Jutish ancestry, could be referred to as .

This name probably either derives from Proto-Germanic , which referred to narrowness, constriction or anxiety, perhaps referring to shallow waters near the coast, or else it may derive from a related word which could refer to curve or hook shapes including fishing hooks. Concerning the second option, it has been hypothesised that the Angles acquired their name either because they lived on a curved promontory of land shaped like a fishhook, or else because they were fishermen (anglers).

== History ==


Old English was not static, and its usage covered a period of 700 years, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain in the 5th century to the late 11th century, some time after the Norman Conquest. While indicating that the establishment of dates is an arbitrary process, Albert Baugh dates Old English from 450 to 1150, a period of full inflections, a synthetic language. Perhaps around 85% of Old English words are no longer in use, but those that survived are the basic elements of Modern English vocabulary.

Old English is a West Germanic language, and developed out of North Sea Germanic dialects from the 5th century. It came to be spoken over most of the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which became the Kingdom of England. This included most of present-day England, as well as part of what is now southeastern Scotland, which for several centuries belonged to the kingdom of Northumbria. Other parts of the island continued to use Celtic languages (Gaelicand perhaps some Pictishin most of Scotland, Medieval Cornish all over Cornwall and in adjacent parts of Devon, Cumbric perhaps to the 12th century in parts of Cumbria, and Welsh in Wales and possibly also on the English side of the Anglo-Welsh border); except in the areas of Scandinavian settlements, where Old Norse was spoken and Danish law applied.

Old English literacy developed after the Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England in the late 7th century. The oldest surviving work of Old English literature is &quot;Cædmon&#x27;s Hymn&quot;, which was composed between 658 and 680 but not written down until the early 8th century. There is a limited corpus of runic inscriptions from the 5th to 7th centuries, but the oldest coherent runic texts (notably the inscriptions on the Franks Casket) date to the early 8th century. The Old English Latin alphabet was introduced around the 8th century.
With the unification of several of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (outside the Danelaw) by Alfred the Great in the later 9th century, the language of government and literature became standardised around the West Saxon dialect (Early West Saxon). Alfred advocated education in English alongside Latin, and had many works translated into the English language; some of them, such as Pope Gregory I&#x27;s treatise &quot;Pastoral Care&quot;, appear to have been translated by Alfred himself. In Old English, typical of the development of literature, poetry arose before prose, but Alfred chiefly inspired the growth of prose.

A later literary standard, dating from the late 10th century, arose under the influence of Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester, and was followed by such writers as the prolific Ælfric of Eynsham (&quot;the Grammarian&quot;). This form of the language is known as the &quot;Winchester standard&quot;, or more commonly as Late West Saxon. It is considered to represent the &quot;classical&quot; form of Old English. It retained its position of prestige until the time of the Norman Conquest, after which English ceased for a time to be of importance as a literary language.

The history of Old English can be subdivided into:
* Prehistoric Old English (); for this period, Old English is mostly a reconstructed language as no literary witnesses survive (with the exception of limited epigraphic evidence). This language, or closely related group of dialects, spoken by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, and pre-dating documented Old English or Anglo-Saxon, has also been called Primitive Old English.
*Early Old English (), the period of the oldest manuscript traditions, with authors such as Cædmon, Bede, Cynewulf and Aldhelm.
*Late Old English (), the final stage of the language leading up to the Norman conquest of England and the subsequent transition to Early Middle English.

The Old English period is followed by Middle English (1150–1500), Early Modern English (1500–1650) and finally Modern English (after 1650), and in Scotland Early Scots (before 1450), Middle Scots () and Modern Scots (after 1700).

== Dialects ==

Just as Modern English is not monolithic, Old English varied according to place. Despite the diversity of language of the Germanic-speaking migrants who established Old English in England and southeastern Scotland, it is possible to reconstruct proto-Old English as a fairly unitary language. For the most part, the differences between the attested regional dialects of Old English developed within England and southeastern Scotland, rather than on the Mainland of Europe. Although from the tenth century Old English writing from all regions tended to conform to a written standard based on Late West Saxon, in speech Old English continued to exhibit much local and regional variation, which remained in Middle English and to some extent Modern English dialects.

The four main dialectal forms of Old English were Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish, and West Saxon. Mercian and Northumbrian are together referred to as &quot;Anglian&quot;. In terms of geography the Northumbrian region lay north of the Humber River; the Mercian lay north of the Thames and south of the Humber River; West Saxon lay south and southwest of the Thames; and the smallest, Kentish region lay southeast of the Thames, a small corner of England. The Kentish region, settled by the Jutes from Jutland, has the scantest literary remains. The term &quot;West Saxon&quot; actually is represented by two different dialects: Early West Saxon and Late West Saxon. Hogg has suggested that these two dialects would be more appropriately named &quot;Alfredian Saxon&quot; and &quot;Æthelwoldian Saxon&quot;, respectively, so that the naive reader would not assume that they are chronologically related.

Each of these four dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the islands. Of these, Northumbria south of the Tyne, and most of Mercia, were overrun by the Vikings during the 9th century. The portion of Mercia that was successfully defended, and all of Kent, were then integrated into Wessex under Alfred the Great.
From that time on, the West Saxon dialect (then in the form now known as Early West Saxon) became standardised as the language of government, and as the basis for the many works of literature and religious materials produced or translated from Latin in that period.

The later literary standard known as Late West Saxon (see ), although centred in the same region of the country, appears not to have been directly descended from Alfred&#x27;s Early West Saxon. For example, the former diphthong tended to become monophthongised to in EWS, but to in LWS.

Due to the centralisation of power and the destruction wrought by Viking invasions, there is relatively little written record of the non-West Saxon dialects after Alfred&#x27;s unification. Some Mercian texts continued to be written, however, and the influence of Mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under Alfred&#x27;s programme, many of which were produced by Mercian scholars. Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken, as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in Middle and Modern English. In fact, what would become the standard forms of Middle English and of Modern English are descended from Mercian rather than West Saxon, while Scots developed from the Northumbrian dialect. It was once claimed that, owing to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the dialect of Somerset.

== Influence of other languages ==
The language of the Anglo-Saxon settlers appears not to have been significantly affected by the native British Celtic languages which it largely displaced. The number of Celtic loanwords introduced into the language is very small, although dialect and toponymic terms are more often retained in western language contact zones (Cumbria, Devon, Welsh Marches and Borders and so on) than in the east. However, various suggestions have been made concerning possible influence that Celtic may have had on developments in English syntax in the post–Old English period, such as the regular progressive construction and analytic word order, as well as the eventual development of the periphrastic auxiliary verb &quot;do&quot;. These ideas have generally not received widespread support from linguists, particularly as many of the theorised Brittonicisms do not become widespread until the late Middle English and Early Modern English periods, in addition to the fact that similar forms exist in other modern Germanic languages.

Old English contained a certain number of loanwords from Latin, which was the scholarly and diplomatic &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Western Europe. It is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the borrowing of individual Latin words based on which patterns of sound change they have undergone. Some Latin words had already been borrowed into the Germanic languages before the ancestral Angles and Saxons left continental Europe for Britain. More entered the language when the Anglo-Saxons were converted to Christianity and Latin-speaking priests became influential. It was also through Irish Christian missionaries that the Latin alphabet was introduced and adapted for the writing of Old English, replacing the earlier runic system. Nonetheless, the largest transfer of Latin-based (mainly Old French) words into English occurred in the Middle English period.

Another source of loanwords was Old Norse, which came into contact with Old English via the Scandinavian rulers and settlers in the Danelaw from the late 9th century, and during the rule of Cnut and other Danish kings in the early 11th century. Many place names in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the West Saxon dialect, away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. Certainly in Middle English texts, which are more often based on eastern dialects, a strong Norse influence becomes apparent. Modern English contains many, often everyday, words that were borrowed from Old Norse, and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the Old English period is also often attributed to Norse influence.

The influence of Old Norse certainly helped move English from a synthetic language along the continuum to a more analytic word order, and Old Norse most likely made a greater impact on the English language than any other language. The eagerness of Vikings in the Danelaw to communicate with their Anglo-Saxon neighbours produced a friction that led to the erosion of the complicated inflectional word endings. Simeon Potter notes:
The strength of the Viking influence on Old English appears from the fact that the indispensable elements of the languagepronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal adverbs (like &quot;hence&quot; and &quot;together&quot;), conjunctions and prepositionsshow the most marked Danish influence; the best evidence of Scandinavian influence appears in the extensive word borrowings because, as Jespersen indicates, no texts exist in either Scandinavia or Northern England from this time to give certain evidence of an influence on syntax. The effect of Old Norse on Old English was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character. Old Norse and Old English resembled each other closely like cousins, and with some words in common, speakers roughly understood each other; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged. It is most important to recognise that in many words the English and Scandinavian languages differed chiefly in their inflectional elements. The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw, these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost. This blending of peoples and languages resulted in &quot;simplifying English grammar&quot;.

== Phonology ==

The inventory of Early West Saxon surface phones is as follows:
The sounds enclosed in parentheses in the chart above are not considered to be phonemes:
* is an allophone of occurring after and when geminated (doubled).
* is an allophone of occurring before [k] and [ɡ].
* are voiced allophones of respectively, occurring between vowels or voiced consonants when the preceding sound was stressed.
* are allophones of occurring at the beginning of a word or after a front vowel, respectively.
* is an allophone of occurring after or when doubled. At some point before the Middle English period, also became the pronunciation word-initially.
*the voiceless sonorants occur after [h] in the sequences .

The above system is largely similar to that of Modern English, except that (and for most speakers) have generally been lost, while the voiced affricate and fricatives (now also including ) have become independent phonemes, as has .
The open back rounded vowel was an allophone of short /ɑ/ which occurred in stressed syllables before nasal consonants (/m/ and /n/). It was variously spelt either ⟨a⟩ or ⟨o⟩.

The Anglian dialects also had the mid front rounded vowel , spelled ⟨oe⟩, which had emerged from i-umlaut of . In West Saxon and Kentish, it had already merged with before the first written prose.

Other dialects had different systems of diphthongs. For example, the Northumbrian dialect retained , which had merged with in West Saxon.

=== Sound changes ===

Some of the principal sound changes occurring in the pre-history and history of Old English were the following:
*Fronting of to except when nasalised or followed by a nasal consonant (&quot;Anglo-Frisian brightening&quot;), partly reversed in certain positions by later &quot;a-restoration&quot; or retraction.
*Monophthongisation of the diphthong , and modification of remaining diphthongs to the height-harmonic type.
*Diphthongisation of long and short front vowels in certain positions (&quot;breaking&quot;).
*Palatalisation of velars to in certain front-vowel environments.
*The process known as i-mutation (which for example led to modern &quot;mice&quot; as the plural of &quot;mouse&quot;).
*Loss of certain weak vowels in word-final and medial positions; reduction of remaining unstressed vowels.
*Diphthongisation of certain vowels before certain consonants when preceding a back vowel (&quot;back mutation&quot;).
*Loss of between vowels or between a voiced consonant and a vowel, with lengthening of the preceding vowel.
*Collapse of two consecutive vowels into a single vowel.
*&quot;Palatal umlaut&quot;, which has given forms such as &quot;six&quot; (compare German ).

== Grammar ==
=== Morphology ===
Nouns decline for five cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental; three genders: masculine, feminine, neuter; and two numbers: singular, and plural; and are strong or weak. The instrumental is vestigial and only used with the masculine and neuter singular and often replaced by the dative. Only pronouns and strong adjectives retain separate instrumental forms. There is also sparse early Northumbrian evidence of a sixth case: the locative. The evidence comes from Northumbrian Runic texts (e.g. &#x27;on the Cross&#x27;).

Adjectives agree with nouns in case, gender, and number, and can be either strong or weak. Pronouns and sometimes participles agree in case, gender, and number. First-person and second-person pronouns occasionally distinguish dual-number forms. The definite article and its inflections serve as a definite article (&quot;the&quot;), a demonstrative adjective (&quot;that&quot;), and demonstrative pronoun. Other demonstratives are (&quot;this&quot;), and (&quot;that over there&quot;). These words inflect for case, gender, and number. Adjectives have both strong and weak sets of endings, weak ones being used when a definite or possessive determiner is also present.

Verbs conjugate for three persons: first, second, and third; two numbers: singular, plural; two tenses: present, and past; three moods: indicative, subjunctive, and imperative; and are strong (exhibiting ablaut) or weak (exhibiting a dental suffix). Verbs have two infinitive forms: bare and bound; and two participles: present and past. The subjunctive has past and present forms. Finite verbs agree with subjects in person and number. The future tense, passive voice, and other aspects are formed with compounds. Adpositions are mostly before but are often after their object. If the object of an adposition is marked in the dative case, an adposition may conceivably be located anywhere in the sentence.

Remnants of the Old English case system in Modern English are in the forms of a few pronouns (such as &quot;I/me/mine&quot;, &quot;she/her&quot;, &quot;who/whom/whose&quot;) and in the possessive ending &quot;-&#x27;s&quot;, which derives from the masculine and neuter genitive ending &quot;-es&quot;. The modern English plural ending &quot;-(e)s&quot; derives from the Old English &quot;-as&quot;, but the latter applied only to &quot;strong&quot; masculine nouns in the nominative and accusative cases; different plural endings were used in other instances. Old English nouns had grammatical gender, while modern English has only natural gender. Pronoun usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender when those conflicted, as in the case of the grammatically neuter (but naturally feminine) noun (), which meant &quot;woman&quot; (from , ) and became Modern English &quot;wife&quot;.

In Old English&#x27;s verbal compound constructions are the beginnings of the compound tenses of Modern English. Old English verbs include strong verbs, which form the past tense by altering the root vowel, and weak verbs, which use a suffix such as . As in Modern English, and peculiar to the Germanic languages, the verbs formed two great classes: weak (regular), and strong (irregular). Like today, Old English had fewer strong verbs, and many of these have over time decayed into weak forms. Then, as now, dental suffixes indicated the past tense of the weak verbs, as in &quot;work&quot; and &quot;worked&quot;.

=== Syntax ===
Old English syntax is similar to that of modern English. Some differences are consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection, allowing freer word order.
*Default word order is verb-second in main clauses, and verb-final in subordinate clauses
*No &quot;do&quot;-support in questions and negatives. Questions were usually formed by inverting subject and finite verb, and negatives by placing &quot;ne&quot; before the finite verb, regardless of which verb.
*Multiple negatives can stack up in a sentence intensifying each other (negative concord).
*Sentences with subordinate clauses of the type &quot;when X, Y&quot; (e.g. &quot;When I got home, I ate dinner&quot;) do not use a &quot;wh-&quot;type conjunction, but rather a &quot;th-&quot;type correlative conjunction such as , otherwise meaning &quot;then&quot; (e.g. in place of &quot;when X, Y&quot;). The &quot;wh-&quot;words (or &quot;hw-words&quot; in Old English&#x27;s case) are used only as interrogatives and as indefinite pronouns.
*Similarly, &quot;wh-&quot;forms were not used as relative pronouns; instead, the indeclinable word is used, often preceded by (or replaced by) the appropriate form of the article/demonstrative .

== Orthography ==


Old English was first written in runes, using the futhorca rune set derived from the Germanic 24-character elder futhark, extended by five more runes used to represent Anglo-Saxon vowel sounds and sometimes by several more additional characters. From around the 8th century, the runic system came to be supplanted by a (minuscule) half-uncial script of the Latin alphabet introduced by Irish Christian missionaries. This was replaced by Insular script, a cursive and pointed version of the half-uncial script. This was used until the end of the 12th century when continental Carolingian minuscule (also known as &quot;Caroline&quot;) replaced the insular.

The Latin alphabet of the time still lacked the letters and , and there was no as distinct from ; moreover native Old English spellings did not use , or . The remaining 20 Latin letters were supplemented by 4 more: (, modern &quot;ash&quot;) and (, now called eth or edh), which were modified Latin letters, and thorn and wynn , which are borrowings from the futhorc. A few letter pairs were used as digraphs, representing a single sound. Also used was the Tironian note (a character similar to the digit ) for the conjunction &quot;and&quot;. A common scribal abbreviation was a thorn with a stroke , which was used for the pronoun (&quot;that&quot;). Macrons over vowels were originally used not to mark long vowels (as in modern editions), but to indicate stress, or as abbreviations for a following or .

Modern editions of Old English manuscripts generally introduce some additional conventions. The modern forms of Latin letters are used, including instead of insular &quot;G&quot;, instead of insular &quot;S&quot; and long &quot;S&quot;, and others which may differ considerably from the insular script, notably , and . Macrons are used to indicate long vowels, where usually no distinction was made between long and short vowels in the originals. (In some older editions an acute accent mark was used for consistency with Old Norse conventions.) Additionally, modern editions often distinguish between velar and palatal and by placing dots above the palatals: , . The letter wynn is usually replaced with , but , and are normally retainedexcept when is replaced by .

In contrast with modern English orthography, Old English spelling was reasonably regular, with a mostly predictable correspondence between letters and phonemes. There were not usually any silent lettersin the word , for example, both the and were pronounced () unlike the and in the modern &quot;knight&quot; ().

Doubled consonants are geminated; the geminate fricatives , and /// are always voiceless , , .

== Literature ==

The corpus of Old English literature is small but still significant, with some 400 surviving manuscripts. The pagan and Christian streams mingle in Old English, one of the richest and most significant bodies of literature preserved among the early Germanic peoples. In his supplementary article to the 1935 posthumous edition of Bright&#x27;s &quot;Anglo-Saxon Reader&quot;, James Hulbert writes:

Some of the most important surviving works of Old English literature are &quot;Beowulf&quot;, an epic poem; the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a record of early English history; the Franks Casket, an inscribed early whalebone artefact; and Cædmon&#x27;s Hymn, a Christian religious poem. There are also a number of extant prose works, such as sermons and saints&#x27; lives, biblical translations, and translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers, legal documents, such as laws and wills, and practical works on grammar, medicine, and geography. Still, poetry is considered the heart of Old English literature. Nearly all Anglo-Saxon authors are anonymous, with a few exceptions, such as Bede and Cædmon. Cædmon, the earliest English poet known by name, served as a lay brother in the monastery at Whitby.

=== &quot;Beowulf&quot; ===

The first example is taken from the opening lines of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, a work with around 3,000 lines. This passage describes how Hrothgar&#x27;s legendary ancestor Scyld was found as a baby, washed ashore, and adopted by a noble family. The translation is literal and represents the original poetic word order. As such, it is not typical of Old English prose. The modern cognates of original words have been used whenever practical to give a close approximation of the feel of the original poem.

The words in brackets are implied in the Old English by noun case and the bold words in brackets are explanations of words that have slightly different meanings in a modern context. &quot;What&quot; is used by the poet where a word like &quot;lo&quot; or &quot;behold&quot; would be expected. This usage is similar to &quot;what-ho!&quot;, both an expression of surprise and a call to attention.

English poetry is based on stress and alliteration. In alliteration, the first consonant in a word alliterates with the same consonant at the beginning of another word, as with and . Vowels alliterate with any other vowel, as with and . In the text below, the letters that alliterate are bolded.

Here is a natural enough Modern English translation, although the phrasing of the Old English passage has often been stylistically preserved, even though it is not usual in Modern English:

=== The Lord&#x27;s Prayer ===

This text of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer is presented in the standardised Early West Saxon dialect.

=== Charter of Cnut ===
This is a proclamation from Cnut to his earl Thorkell the Tall and the English people written in AD 1019. Unlike the previous two examples, this text is prose rather than poetry. For ease of reading, the passage has been divided into sentences while the pilcrows represent the original division.

The following is a natural Modern English translation, with the overall structure of the Old English passage preserved. Even though &quot;earl&quot; is used to translate its Old English cognate &quot;eorl&quot;, &quot;eorl&quot; in Old English does not correspond exactly to &quot;earl&quot; of the later medieval period:

== Dictionaries ==
=== Early history ===
The earliest history of Old English lexicography lies in the Anglo-Saxon period itself, when English-speaking scholars created English glosses on Latin texts. At first, these were often marginal or interlinear glosses; however, they soon came to be gathered into word-lists such as the Épinal-Erfurt, Leiden and Corpus Glossaries. Over time, these word-lists were consolidated and alphabetised to create extensive Latin–Old English glossaries with some of the character of dictionaries, such as the Cleopatra Glossaries, the Harley Glossary and the Brussels Glossary. In some cases, the material in these glossaries continued to be circulated and updated in Middle English glossaries, such as the Durham Plant-Name Glossary and the Laud Herbal Glossary.

Old English lexicography was revived in the early modern period, drawing heavily on Anglo-Saxons&#x27; own glossaries. The major publication at this time was William Somner&#x27;s &quot;Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum&quot;. The next substantial Old English dictionary was Joseph Bosworth&#x27;s &quot;Anglo-Saxon Dictionary&quot; of 1838.

=== Modern ===
In modern scholarship, the following dictionaries remain current:
* Cameron, Angus, et al. (ed.) (1983–). &quot;Dictionary of Old English&quot;. Toronto: Published for the Dictionary of Old English Project, Centre for Medieval Studies, University of Toronto by the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies. Initially issued on microfiche and subsequently as a CD-ROM, the dictionary is now primarily published online at https://www.doe.utoronto.ca. This generally supersedes previous dictionaries where available. As of September 2018, the dictionary covered A-I.
* Bosworth, Joseph and T. Northcote Toller. (1898). &quot;An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary&quot;. Oxford: Clarendon. The main research dictionary for Old English, unless superseded by the &quot;Dictionary of Old English&quot;. Various digitisations are available open-access, including at http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/. Due to errors and omissions in the 1898 publication, this needs to be read in conjunction with:
** T. Northcote Toller. (1921). &quot;An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary: Supplement&quot;. Oxford: Clarendon.
** Alistair Campbell (1972). &quot;An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary: Enlarged addenda and corrigenda&quot;. Oxford: Clarendon.
* Clark Hall, J. R. (1969). &quot;A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary&quot;. 4th rev. edn by Herbet D. Meritt. Cambridge University Press. Occasionally more accurate than Bosworth-Toller, and widely used as a reading dictionary. Various digitisations are available, including here.
* Roberts, Jane and Christian Kay, with Lynne Grundy, &quot;A Thesaurus of Old English in Two Volumes&quot;, Costerus New Series, 131–32, 2nd rev. impression, 2 vols (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2000), also available online. A thesaurus based on the definitions in Bosworth-Toller and the structure of &quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot;.

Though focused on later periods, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Middle English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue&quot;, and &quot;Historical Thesaurus of English&quot; all also include material relevant to Old English.

== Modern legacy ==
Like other historical languages, Old English has been used by scholars and enthusiasts of later periods to create texts either imitating Old English literature or deliberately transferring it to a different cultural context. Examples include Alistair Campbell and J. R. R. Tolkien. Ransom Riggs uses several Old English words, such as syndrigast (singular, peculiar), ymbryne (period, cycle), etc., dubbed as &quot;Old Peculiar&quot; ones. Advocates of linguistic purism in English often look to older forms of English, including Old English, as a means of either reviving old words or coining new ones.

A number of websites devoted to Modern Paganism and historical reenactment offer reference material and forums promoting the active use of Old English. There is also an Old English version of Wikipedia. However, one investigation found that many Neo-Old English texts published online bear little resemblance to the historical language and have many basic grammatical mistakes.

<text>An open cluster is a type of star cluster made of tens to a few thousand stars that were formed from the same giant molecular cloud and have roughly the same age. More than 1,100 open clusters have been discovered within the Milky Way galaxy, and many more are thought to exist. Each one is loosely bound by mutual gravitational attraction and becomes disrupted by close encounters with other clusters and clouds of gas as they orbit the Galactic Center. This can result in a loss of cluster members through internal close encounters and a dispersion into the main body of the galaxy. Open clusters generally survive for a few hundred million years, with the most massive ones surviving for a few billion years. In contrast, the more massive globular clusters of stars exert a stronger gravitational attraction on their members, and can survive for longer. Open clusters have been found only in spiral and irregular galaxies, in which active star formation is occurring.

Young open clusters may be contained within the molecular cloud from which they formed, illuminating it to create an H II region. Over time, radiation pressure from the cluster will disperse the molecular cloud. Typically, about 10% of the mass of a gas cloud will coalesce into stars before radiation pressure drives the rest of the gas away.

Open clusters are key objects in the study of stellar evolution. Because the cluster members are of similar age and chemical composition, their properties (such as distance, age, metallicity, extinction, and velocity) are more easily determined than they are for isolated stars. A number of open clusters, such as the Pleiades, the Hyades and the Alpha Persei Cluster, are visible with the naked eye. Some others, such as the Double Cluster, are barely perceptible without instruments, while many more can be seen using binoculars or telescopes. The Wild Duck Cluster, M11, is an example.

==Historical observations==
The prominent open cluster the Pleiades, in the constellation Taurus, has been recognized as a group of stars since antiquity, while the Hyades (which also form part of Taurus) is one of the oldest open clusters. Other open clusters were noted by early astronomers as unresolved fuzzy patches of light. In his &quot;Almagest&quot;, the Roman astronomer Ptolemy mentions the Praesepe cluster, the Double Cluster in Perseus, the Coma Star Cluster and the Ptolemy Cluster, while the Persian astronomer Al-Sufi wrote of the Omicron Velorum cluster. However, it would require the invention of the telescope to resolve these &quot;nebulae&quot; into their constituent stars. Indeed, in 1603 Johann Bayer gave three of these clusters designations as if they were single stars.

The first person to use a telescope to observe the night sky and record his observations was the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1609. When he turned the telescope toward some of the nebulous patches recorded by Ptolemy, he found they were not a single star, but groupings of many stars. For Praesepe, he found more than 40 stars. Where previously observers had noted only 6–7 stars in the Pleiades, he found almost 50. In his 1610 treatise &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot;, Galileo Galilei wrote, &quot;the galaxy is nothing else but a mass of innumerable stars planted together in clusters.&quot; Influenced by Galileo&#x27;s work, the Sicilian astronomer Giovanni Hodierna became possibly the first astronomer to use a telescope to find previously undiscovered open clusters. In 1654, he identified the objects now designated Messier 41, Messier 47, NGC 2362 and NGC 2451.

It was realized as early as 1767 that the stars in a cluster were physically related, when the English naturalist the Reverend John Michell calculated that the probability of even just one group of stars like the Pleiades being the result of a chance alignment as seen from Earth was just 1 in 496,000. Between 1774 and 1781, French astronomer Charles Messier published a catalogue of celestial objects that had a nebulous appearance similar to comets. This catalogue included 26 open clusters. In the 1790s, English astronomer William Herschel began an extensive study of nebulous celestial objects. He discovered that many of these features could be resolved into groupings of individual stars. Herschel conceived the idea that stars were initially scattered across space, but later became clustered together as star systems because of gravitational attraction. He divided the nebulae into eight classes, with classes VI through VIII being used to classify clusters of stars.

The number of clusters known continued to increase under the efforts of astronomers. Hundreds of open clusters were listed in the &quot;New General Catalogue&quot;, first published in 1888 by the Danish–Irish astronomer J. L. E. Dreyer, and the two supplemental Index Catalogues, published in 1896 and 1905. Telescopic observations revealed two distinct types of clusters, one of which contained thousands of stars in a regular spherical distribution and was found all across the sky but preferentially towards the center of the Milky Way. The other type consisted of a generally sparser population of stars in a more irregular shape. These were generally found in or near the galactic plane of the Milky Way. Astronomers dubbed the former globular clusters, and the latter open clusters. Because of their location, open clusters are occasionally referred to as &quot;galactic clusters&quot;, a term that was introduced in 1925 by the Swiss-American astronomer Robert Julius Trumpler.

Micrometer measurements of the positions of stars in clusters were made as early as 1877 by the German astronomer E. Schönfeld and further pursued by the American astronomer E. E. Barnard prior to his death in 1923. No indication of stellar motion was detected by these efforts. However, in 1918 the Dutch–American astronomer Adriaan van Maanen was able to measure the proper motion of stars in part of the Pleiades cluster by comparing photographic plates taken at different times. As astrometry became more accurate, cluster stars were found to share a common proper motion through space. By comparing the photographic plates of the Pleiades cluster taken in 1918 with images taken in 1943, van Maanen was able to identify those stars that had a proper motion similar to the mean motion of the cluster, and were therefore more likely to be members. Spectroscopic measurements revealed common radial velocities, thus showing that the clusters consist of stars bound together as a group.

The first color–magnitude diagrams of open clusters were published by Ejnar Hertzsprung in 1911, giving the plot for the Pleiades and Hyades star clusters. He continued this work on open clusters for the next twenty years. From spectroscopic data, he was able to determine the upper limit of internal motions for open clusters, and could estimate that the total mass of these objects did not exceed several hundred times the mass of the Sun. He demonstrated a relationship between the star colors and their magnitudes, and in 1929 noticed that the Hyades and Praesepe clusters had different stellar populations than the Pleiades. This would subsequently be interpreted as a difference in ages of the three clusters.

==Formation==
The formation of an open cluster begins with the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud, a cold dense cloud of gas and dust containing up to many thousands of times the mass of the Sun. These clouds have densities that vary from 102 to 106 molecules of neutral hydrogen per cm3, with star formation occurring in regions with densities above 104 molecules per cm3. Typically, only 1–10% of the cloud by volume is above the latter density. Prior to collapse, these clouds maintain their mechanical equilibrium through magnetic fields, turbulence and rotation.

Many factors may disrupt the equilibrium of a giant molecular cloud, triggering a collapse and initiating the burst of star formation that can result in an open cluster. These include shock waves from a nearby supernova, collisions with other clouds and gravitational interactions. Even without external triggers, regions of the cloud can reach conditions where they become unstable against collapse. The collapsing cloud region will undergo hierarchical fragmentation into ever smaller clumps, including a particularly dense form known as infrared dark clouds, eventually leading to the formation of up to several thousand stars. This star formation begins enshrouded in the collapsing cloud, blocking the protostars from sight but allowing infrared observation. In the Milky Way galaxy, the formation rate of open clusters is estimated to be one every few thousand years.
The hottest and most massive of the newly formed stars (known as OB stars) will emit intense ultraviolet radiation, which steadily ionizes the surrounding gas of the giant molecular cloud, forming an H II region. Stellar winds and radiation pressure from the massive stars begins to drive away the hot ionized gas at a velocity matching the speed of sound in the gas. After a few million years the cluster will experience its first core-collapse supernovae, which will also expel gas from the vicinity. In most cases these processes will strip the cluster of gas within ten million years, and no further star formation will take place. Still, about half of the resulting protostellar objects will be left surrounded by circumstellar disks, many of which form accretion disks.

As only 30 to 40 percent of the gas in the cloud core forms stars, the process of residual gas expulsion is highly damaging to the star formation process. All clusters thus suffer significant infant weight loss, while a large fraction undergo infant mortality. At this point, the formation of an open cluster will depend on whether the newly formed stars are gravitationally bound to each other; otherwise an unbound stellar association will result. Even when a cluster such as the Pleiades does form, it may hold on to only a third of the original stars, with the remainder becoming unbound once the gas is expelled. The young stars so released from their natal cluster become part of the Galactic field population.

Because most if not all stars form in clusters, star clusters are to be viewed as the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The violent gas-expulsion events that shape and destroy many star clusters at birth leave their imprint in the morphological and kinematical structures of galaxies. Most open clusters form with at least 100 stars and a mass of 50 or more solar masses. The largest clusters can have over 104 solar masses, with the massive cluster Westerlund 1 being estimated at 5 × 104 solar masses and R136 at almost 5 x 105, typical of globular clusters. While open clusters and globular clusters form two fairly distinct groups, there may not be a great deal of intrinsic difference between a very sparse globular cluster such as Palomar 12 and a very rich open cluster. Some astronomers believe the two types of star clusters form via the same basic mechanism, with the difference being that the conditions that allowed the formation of the very rich globular clusters containing hundreds of thousands of stars no longer prevail in the Milky Way.

It is common for two or more separate open clusters to form out of the same molecular cloud. In the Large Magellanic Cloud, both Hodge 301 and R136 have formed from the gases of the Tarantula Nebula, while in our own galaxy, tracing back the motion through space of the Hyades and Praesepe, two prominent nearby open clusters, suggests that they formed in the same cloud about 600 million years ago. Sometimes, two clusters born at the same time will form a binary cluster. The best known example in the Milky Way is the Double Cluster of NGC 869 and NGC 884 (also known as h and χ Persei), but at least 10 more double clusters are known to exist. New research indicates the Cepheid-hosting M25 may constitute a ternary star cluster together with NGC 6716 and Collinder 394. Many more binary clusters are known in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds—they are easier to detect in external systems than in our own galaxy because projection effects can cause unrelated clusters within the Milky Way to appear close to each other.

==Morphology and classification==

Open clusters range from very sparse clusters with only a few members to large s containing thousands of stars. They usually consist of quite a distinct dense core, surrounded by a more diffuse &#x27;corona&#x27; of cluster members. The core is typically about 3–4 light years across, with the corona extending to about 20 light years from the cluster center. Typical star densities in the center of a cluster are about 1.5 stars per cubic light year; the stellar density near the Sun is about 0.003 stars per cubic light year.

Open clusters are often classified according to a scheme developed by Robert Trumpler in 1930. The Trumpler scheme gives a cluster a three-part designation, with a Roman numeral from I-IV for little to very disparate, an Arabic numeral from 1 to 3 for the range in brightness of members (from small to large range), and &quot;p&quot;, &quot;m&quot; or &quot;r&quot; to indication whether the cluster is poor, medium or rich in stars. An &#x27;n&#x27; is appended if the cluster lies within nebulosity.

Under the Trumpler scheme, the Pleiades are classified as I3rn, and the nearby Hyades are classified as II3m.

==Numbers and distribution==
There are over 1,100 known open clusters in our galaxy, but the true total may be up to ten times higher than that. In spiral galaxies, open clusters are largely found in the spiral arms where gas densities are highest and so most star formation occurs, and clusters usually disperse before they have had time to travel beyond their spiral arm. Open clusters are strongly concentrated close to the galactic plane, with a scale height in our galaxy of about 180 light years, compared with a galactic radius of approximately 50,000 light years.

In irregular galaxies, open clusters may be found throughout the galaxy, although their concentration is highest where the gas density is highest. Open clusters are not seen in elliptical galaxies: Star formation ceased many millions of years ago in ellipticals, and so the open clusters which were originally present have long since dispersed.

In the Milky Way Galaxy, the distribution of clusters depends on age, with older clusters being preferentially found at greater distances from the Galactic Center, generally at substantial distances above or below the galactic plane. Tidal forces are stronger nearer the center of the galaxy, increasing the rate of disruption of clusters, and also the giant molecular clouds which cause the disruption of clusters are concentrated towards the inner regions of the galaxy, so clusters in the inner regions of the galaxy tend to get dispersed at a younger age than their counterparts in the outer regions.

==Stellar composition==
Because open clusters tend to be dispersed before most of their stars reach the end of their lives, the light from them tends to be dominated by the young, hot blue stars. These stars are the most massive, and have the shortest lives, a few tens of millions of years. The older open clusters tend to contain more yellow stars.

The frequency of binary star systems has been observed to be higher within open clusters than outside open clusters. This is seen as evidence that single stars get ejected from open clusters due to dynamical interactions.

Some open clusters contain hot blue stars which seem to be much younger than the rest of the cluster. These blue stragglers are also observed in globular clusters, and in the very dense cores of globulars they are believed to arise when stars collide, forming a much hotter, more massive star. However, the stellar density in open clusters is much lower than that in globular clusters, and stellar collisions cannot explain the numbers of blue stragglers observed. Instead, it is thought that most of them probably originate when dynamical interactions with other stars cause a binary system to coalesce into one star.

Once they have exhausted their supply of hydrogen through nuclear fusion, medium- to low-mass stars shed their outer layers to form a planetary nebula and evolve into white dwarfs. While most clusters become dispersed before a large proportion of their members have reached the white dwarf stage, the number of white dwarfs in open clusters is still generally much lower than would be expected, given the age of the cluster and the expected initial mass distribution of the stars. One possible explanation for the lack of white dwarfs is that when a red giant expels its outer layers to become a planetary nebula, a slight asymmetry in the loss of material could give the star a &#x27;kick&#x27; of a few kilometres per second, enough to eject it from the cluster.

Because of their high density, close encounters between stars in an open cluster are common. For a typical cluster with 1,000 stars with a 0.5 parsec half-mass radius, on average a star will have an encounter with another member every 10 million years. The rate is even higher in denser clusters. These encounters can have a significant impact on the extended circumstellar disks of material that surround many young stars. Tidal perturbations of large disks may result in the formation of massive planets and brown dwarfs, producing companions at distances of 100 AU or more from the host star.

==Eventual fate==
Many open clusters are inherently unstable, with a small enough mass that the escape velocity of the system is lower than the average velocity of the constituent stars. These clusters will rapidly disperse within a few million years. In many cases, the stripping away of the gas from which the cluster formed by the radiation pressure of the hot young stars reduces the cluster mass enough to allow rapid dispersal.

Clusters that have enough mass to be gravitationally bound once the surrounding nebula has evaporated can remain distinct for many tens of millions of years, but, over time, internal and external processes tend also to disperse them. Internally, close encounters between stars can increase the velocity of a member beyond the escape velocity of the cluster. This results in the gradual &#x27;evaporation&#x27; of cluster members.

Externally, about every half-billion years or so an open cluster tends to be disturbed by external factors such as passing close to or through a molecular cloud. The gravitational tidal forces generated by such an encounter tend to disrupt the cluster. Eventually, the cluster becomes a stream of stars, not close enough to be a cluster but all related and moving in similar directions at similar speeds. The timescale over which a cluster disrupts depends on its initial stellar density, with more tightly packed clusters persisting longer. Estimated cluster half lives, after which half the original cluster members will have been lost, range from 150–800 million years, depending on the original density.

After a cluster has become gravitationally unbound, many of its constituent stars will still be moving through space on similar trajectories, in what is known as a stellar association, moving cluster, or moving group. Several of the brightest stars in the &#x27;Plough&#x27; of Ursa Major are former members of an open cluster which now form such an association, in this case the Ursa Major Moving Group. Eventually their slightly different relative velocities will see them scattered throughout the galaxy. A larger cluster is then known as a stream, if we discover the similar velocities and ages of otherwise well-separated stars.

==Studying stellar evolution==
When a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram is plotted for an open cluster, most stars lie on the main sequence. The most massive stars have begun to evolve away from the main sequence and are becoming red giants; the position of the turn-off from the main sequence can be used to estimate the age of the cluster.

Because the stars in an open cluster are all at roughly the same distance from Earth, and were born at roughly the same time from the same raw material, the differences in apparent brightness among cluster members are due only to their mass. This makes open clusters very useful in the study of stellar evolution, because when comparing one star with another, many of the variable parameters are fixed.

The study of the abundances of lithium and beryllium in open-cluster stars can give important clues about the evolution of stars and their interior structures. While hydrogen nuclei cannot fuse to form helium until the temperature reaches about 10 million K, lithium and beryllium are destroyed at temperatures of 2.5 million K and 3.5 million K respectively. This means that their abundances depend strongly on how much mixing occurs in stellar interiors. Through study of their abundances in open-cluster stars, variables such as age and chemical composition can be fixed.

Studies have shown that the abundances of these light elements are much lower than models of stellar evolution predict. While the reason for this underabundance is not yet fully understood, one possibility is that convection in stellar interiors can &#x27;overshoot&#x27; into regions where radiation is normally the dominant mode of energy transport.

==Astronomical distance scale==
Determining the distances to astronomical objects is crucial to understanding them, but the vast majority of objects are too far away for their distances to be directly determined. Calibration of the astronomical distance scale relies on a sequence of indirect and sometimes uncertain measurements relating the closest objects, for which distances can be directly measured, to increasingly distant objects. Open clusters are a crucial step in this sequence.

The closest open clusters can have their distance measured directly by one of two methods. First, the parallax (the small change in apparent position over the course of a year caused by the Earth moving from one side of its orbit around the Sun to the other) of stars in close open clusters can be measured, like other individual stars. Clusters such as the Pleiades, Hyades and a few others within about 500 light years are close enough for this method to be viable, and results from the Hipparcos position-measuring satellite yielded accurate distances for several clusters.

The other direct method is the so-called moving cluster method. This relies on the fact that the stars of a cluster share a common motion through space. Measuring the proper motions of cluster members and plotting their apparent motions across the sky will reveal that they converge on a vanishing point. The radial velocity of cluster members can be determined from Doppler shift measurements of their spectra, and once the radial velocity, proper motion and angular distance from the cluster to its vanishing point are known, simple trigonometry will reveal the distance to the cluster. The Hyades are the best-known application of this method, which reveals their distance to be 46.3 parsecs.

Once the distances to nearby clusters have been established, further techniques can extend the distance scale to more distant clusters. By matching the main sequence on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram for a cluster at a known distance with that of a more distant cluster, the distance to the more distant cluster can be estimated. The nearest open cluster is the Hyades: The stellar association consisting of most of the Plough stars is at about half the distance of the Hyades, but is a stellar association rather than an open cluster as the stars are not gravitationally bound to each other. The most distant known open cluster in our galaxy is Berkeley 29, at a distance of about 15,000 parsecs. Open clusters, especially super star clusters, are also easily detected in many of the galaxies of the Local Group and nearby: e.g., NGC 346 and the SSCs R136 and NGC 1569 A and B.

Accurate knowledge of open cluster distances is vital for calibrating the period–luminosity relationship shown by variable stars such as Cepheid stars, which allows them to be used as standard candles. These luminous stars can be detected at great distances, and are then used to extend the distance scale to nearby galaxies in the Local Group. Indeed, the open cluster designated NGC 7790 hosts three classical Cepheids. RR Lyrae variables are too old to be associated with open clusters, and are instead found in globular clusters.

==Planets==
The stars in open clusters can host exoplanets, just like stars outside open clusters. For example, the open cluster NGC 6811 contains two known planetary systems, Kepler-66 and Kepler-67. Additionally, several hot Jupiters are known to exist in the Beehive Cluster.

<doc id="22673" wikidata="Q846527" url="?curid=22673" title="Orimulsion">
<text>Orimulsion is a registered trademark name for a bitumen-based fuel that was developed for industrial use by Intevep, the Research and Development Affiliate of Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), following earlier collaboration on oil emulsions with BP.

==Source of the bitumen==
Like coal and oil, bitumen occurs naturally and is obtained from the world&#x27;s largest deposit in the Orinoco Belt in Venezuela. The deposit is estimated to be more than 1,300 billion barrels (190 billion m3) of bitumen, an amount approximately equivalent to the world&#x27;s estimated proven oil reserves.

==Preparation==
Raw bitumen has an extremely high viscosity and specific gravity between 8 and 10 API gravity at ambient temperatures, making it unsuitable for direct use in conventional power stations. Orimulsion is produced by mixing the bitumen with approximately 30% fresh water and a small amount of surfactant. The resulting mixture behaves similarly to fuel oil. Recently, an alcohol-based surfactant has replaced the original phenol-based version, improving the transport properties of the fuel and eliminating the health concerns associated with the phenol group of surfactants.

==Advantages==
As a fuel for electricity generation, Orimulsion has a number of attractive characteristics:
* the known reserves of bitumen are very large;
* it is currently priced to be competitive with internationally traded coal;
* it is relatively easy and safe to produce, transport, handle and store;
* it is easy to ignite and has good combustion characteristics;
* it can be used in power stations designed to run on coal or heavy fuel oil, with suitable modification.

==Disadvantages==
While Orimulsion is little different to fuel oil in relation to environmental impacts when burnt, being similarly susceptible to pollution mitigation techniques, it is more problematic in spill situations. 
If a spill occurs during shipping over water, the Orimulsion mixture de-emulsifies, causing the bitumen to separate and no longer remain in suspension.

Orimulsion is classified as a non-Newtonian fluid, and if its temperature drops below 30 °C, it undergoes a process referred to as &#x27;setting&#x27;. Once set, it becomes extremely difficult to pump, and restarting operations or restoring the flow through the pipeline becomes impossible.

==Decreasing usage==
Orimulsion is currently used as a commercial boiler fuel in power plants worldwide, including countries such as Japan, Italy and China. Its usage was previously more widespread, and there was an increasing demand for it. However, following the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03, many engineers from PDVSA were dismissed. Since Orimulsion had been highly regarded by these engineers, it lost favor among key political leaders. Consequently, the Venezuelan government has been attempting to gradually phase out the Orimulsion program, except for its sales to China. The Venezuelan government maintains close ties with China, similar to its relationship with Cuba. As a result, China continues to receive supplies of Orimulsion, while the rest of the world either had their supply terminated or is still in the process of winding down. Despite these developments, Orimulsion still holds great potential for domestic consumption.

Another reason given by current PDVSA management is that with rising crude oil prices, it has been found that mixing or diluting Orinoco bitumen (extra-heavy oil) with a lighter crude oil can make this blend more profitable as a crude oil on the world market than by selling it as Orimulsion. An example of this is the popular Merey blend (Orinoco bitumen and Mesa crude oil). ConocoPhillips along with PDVSA operate the Merey Sweeny (bpd) delayed coker, vacuum tower and related facilities at ConocoPhillips&#x27; refinery in Sweeny, Texas, U.S.A. for processing and upgrading heavy sour Merey crude oil.

Air pollutant control technology that is commonly available can limit emissions from Orimulsion to levels considered &quot;Best Available Control Technology&quot;, as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

<text>The Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship contends that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, wrote the plays and poems of William Shakespeare. While historians and literary scholars overwhelmingly reject alternative authorship candidates, including Oxford, public interest in the Oxfordian theory continues. After the 1920s, the Oxfordian theory became the most popular alternative Shakespeare authorship theory.

The convergence of documentary evidence of the type used by academics for authorial attribution – title pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and official records – sufficiently establishes Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship for the overwhelming majority of Shakespeare scholars and literary historians, and no such documentary evidence links Oxford to Shakespeare&#x27;s works. Oxfordians, however, reject the historical record and claim that circumstantial evidence supports Oxford’s authorship, proposing that the contradictory historical evidence is part of a conspiracy that falsified the record to protect the identity of the real author. Scholarly literary specialists consider the Oxfordian method of interpreting the plays and poems as grounded in an autobiographical fallacy, and argue that using his works to infer and construct a hypothetical author&#x27;s biography is both unreliable and logically unsound.

Oxfordian arguments rely heavily on biographical allusions; adherents find correspondences between incidents and circumstances in Oxford&#x27;s life and events in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, sonnets, and longer poems. The case also relies on perceived parallels of language, idiom, and thought between Shakespeare&#x27;s works and Oxford&#x27;s own poetry and letters. Oxfordians claim that marked passages in Oxford&#x27;s Bible can be linked to Biblical allusions in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. That no plays survive under Oxford&#x27;s name is also important to the Oxfordian theory. Oxfordians interpret certain 16th- and 17th-century literary allusions as indicating that Oxford was one of the more prominent suppressed anonymous and/or pseudonymous writers of the day. Under this scenario, Shakespeare was either a &quot;front man&quot; or &quot;play-broker&quot; who published the plays under his own name or was merely an actor with a similar name, misidentified as the playwright since the first Shakespeare biographies of the early 1700s.

The most compelling evidence against the Oxfordian theory is de Vere&#x27;s death in 1604, since the generally accepted chronology of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays places the composition of approximately twelve of the plays after that date. Oxfordians respond that the annual publication of &quot;new&quot; or &quot;corrected&quot; Shakespeare plays stopped in 1604, and that the dedication to &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; implies that the author was dead prior to their publication in 1609. Oxfordians believe the reason so many of the &quot;late plays&quot; show evidence of revision and collaboration is because they were completed by other playwrights after Oxford&#x27;s death.

==History of the Oxfordian theory==
The theory that the works of Shakespeare were in fact written by someone other than William Shakespeare dates back to the mid-nineteenth century. In 1857, the first book on the topic, &quot;The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded&quot;, by Delia Bacon, was published. Bacon proposed the first &quot;group theory&quot; of Shakespearian authorship, attributing the works to a committee headed by Francis Bacon and including Walter Raleigh. De Vere is mentioned once in the book, in a list of &quot;high-born wits and poets&quot;, who were associated with Raleigh. Some commentators have interpreted this to imply that he was part of the group of authors. Throughout the 19th century Bacon was the preferred hidden author. Oxford is not known to have been mentioned again in this context.
By the beginning of the twentieth century other candidates, typically aristocrats, were put forward, most notably Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland, and William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby. Oxford&#x27;s candidacy as sole author was first proposed by J. Thomas Looney in his 1920 book &quot;Shakespeare Identified in Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford&quot;. Following earlier anti-Stratfordians, Looney argued that the known facts of Shakespeare&#x27;s life did not fit the personality he ascribed to the author of the plays. Like other anti-Stratfordians before him, Looney referred to the absence of records concerning Shakespeare&#x27;s education, his limited experience of the world, his allegedly poor handwriting skills (evidenced in his signatures), and the &quot;dirt and ignorance&quot; of Stratford at the time. Shakespeare had a petty &quot;acquisitive disposition&quot;, he said, while the plays made heroes of free-spending figures. They also portrayed middle and lower-class people negatively, while Shakespearian heroes were typically aristocratic. Looney referred to scholars who found in the plays evidence that their author was an expert in law, widely read in ancient Latin literature, and could speak French and Italian. Looney believed that even very early works such as &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; implied that he was already a person of &quot;matured powers&quot;, in his forties or fifties, with wide experience of the world. Looney considered that Oxford&#x27;s personality fitted the one he deduced from the plays, and he also identified characters in the plays as detailed portraits of Oxford&#x27;s family and personal contacts. Several characters, including Hamlet and Bertram (in &quot;All&#x27;s Well that Ends Well&quot;), were, he believed, self-portraits. Adapting arguments earlier used for Rutland and Derby, Looney fitted events in the plays to episodes in Oxford&#x27;s life, including his travels to France and Italy, the settings for many plays. Oxford&#x27;s death in 1604 was linked to a drop-off in the publication of Shakespeare plays. Looney declared that the late play &quot;The Tempest&quot; was not written by Oxford, and that others performed or published after Oxford&#x27;s death were most probably left incomplete and finished by other writers, thus explaining the apparent idiosyncrasies of style found in the late Shakespeare plays. Looney also introduced the argument that the reference to the &quot;ever-living poet&quot; in the 1609 dedication to Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets implied that the author was dead at the time of publication.

Sigmund Freud, the novelist Marjorie Bowen, and several 20th-century celebrities found the thesis persuasive, and Oxford soon overtook Bacon as the favoured alternative candidate to Shakespeare, though academic Shakespearians mostly ignored the subject. Looney&#x27;s theory attracted a number of activist followers who published books supplementing his own and added new arguments, most notably Percy Allen, Bernard M. Ward, Louis P. Bénézet and Charles Wisner Barrell. Mainstream scholar Steven W. May has noted that Oxfordians of this period made genuine contributions to knowledge of Elizabethan history, citing &quot;Ward&#x27;s quite competent biography of the Earl&quot; and &quot;Charles Wisner Barrell&#x27;s identification of Edward Vere, Oxford&#x27;s illegitimate son by Anne Vavasour&quot; as examples. In 1921, Sir George Greenwood, Looney, and others founded The Shakespeare Fellowship, an organization originally dedicated to the discussion and promotion of ecumenical anti-Stratfordian views, but which later became devoted to promoting Oxford as the true Shakespeare.

===Decline and revival===
After a period of decline of the Oxfordian theory beginning with World War II, in 1952 Dorothy and Charlton Greenwood Ogburn published the 1,300-page &quot;This Star of England&quot;, which briefly revived Oxfordism. A series of critical academic books and articles, however, held in check any appreciable growth of anti-Stratfordism and Oxfordism, most notably &quot;The Shakespeare Ciphers Examined&quot; (1957), by William and Elizebeth Friedman, &quot;The Poacher from Stratford&quot; (1958), by Frank Wadsworth, &quot;Shakespeare and His Betters&quot; (1958), by Reginald Churchill, &quot;The Shakespeare Claimants&quot; (1962), by H. N. Gibson, and &quot;Shakespeare and his Rivals: A Casebook on the Authorship Controversy&quot; (1962), by George L. McMichael and Edgar M. Glenn. By 1968 the newsletter of The Shakespeare Oxford Society reported that &quot;the missionary or evangelical spirit of most of our members seems to be at a low ebb, dormant, or non-existent&quot;. In 1974, membership in the society stood at 80. In 1979, the publication of an analysis of the Ashbourne portrait dealt a further blow to the movement. The painting, long claimed to be one of the portraits of Shakespeare, but considered by Barrell to be an overpaint of a portrait of the Earl of Oxford, turned out to represent neither, but rather depicted Hugh Hamersley.

Charlton Ogburn Jr., was elected president of The Shakespeare Oxford Society in 1976 and kick-started the modern revival of the Oxfordian movement by seeking publicity through moot court trials, media debates, television and later the Internet, including Wikipedia, methods which became standard for Oxfordian and anti-Stratfordian promoters because of their success in recruiting members of the lay public. He portrayed academic scholars as self-interested members of an &quot;entrenched authority&quot; that aimed to &quot;outlaw and silence dissent in a supposedly free society&quot;, and proposed to counter their influence by portraying Oxford as a candidate on equal footing with Shakespeare.

In 1985 Ogburn published his 900-page &quot;The Mysterious William Shakespeare: the Myth and the Reality&quot;, with a Foreword by Pulitzer prize-winning historian David McCullough who wrote: &quot;[T]his brilliant, powerful book is a major event for everyone who cares about Shakespeare. The scholarship is surpassing—brave, original, full of surprise... The strange, difficult, contradictory man who emerges as the real Shakespeare, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, is not just plausible but fascinating and wholly believable.&quot;

By framing the issue as one of fairness in the atmosphere of conspiracy that permeated America after Watergate, he used the media to circumnavigate academia and appeal directly to the public. Ogburn&#x27;s efforts secured Oxford the place as the most popular alternative candidate.

Although Shakespearian experts disparaged Ogburn&#x27;s methodology and his conclusions, one reviewer, Richmond Crinkley, the Folger Shakespeare Library&#x27;s former director of educational programs, acknowledged the appeal of Ogburn&#x27;s approach, writing that the doubts over Shakespeare, &quot;arising early and growing rapidly&quot;, have a &quot;simple, direct plausibility&quot;, and the dismissive attitude of established scholars only worked to encourage such doubts. Though Crinkley rejected Ogburn&#x27;s thesis, calling it &quot;less satisfactory than the unsatisfactory orthodoxy it challenges&quot;, he believed that one merit of the book lay in how it forces orthodox scholars to reexamine their concept of Shakespeare as author. Spurred by Ogburn&#x27;s book, &quot;[i]n the last decade of the twentieth century members of the Oxfordian camp gathered strength and made a fresh assault on the Shakespearean citadel, hoping finally to unseat the man from Stratford and install de Vere in his place.&quot;

The Oxfordian theory returned to public attention in anticipation of the late October 2011 release of Roland Emmerich&#x27;s drama film &quot;Anonymous&quot;. Its distributor, Sony Pictures, advertised that the film &quot;presents a compelling portrait of Edward de Vere as the true author of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays&quot;, and commissioned high school and college-level lesson plans to promote the authorship question to history and literature teachers across the United States. According to Sony Pictures, &quot;the objective for our Anonymous program, as stated in the classroom literature, is &#x27;to encourage critical thinking by challenging students to examine the theories about the authorship of Shakespeare&#x27;s works and to formulate their own opinions.&#x27; The study guide does not state that Edward de Vere is the writer of Shakespeare&#x27;s work, but it does pose the authorship question which has been debated by scholars for decades&quot;.

==Variant Oxfordian theories==

Although most Oxfordians agree on the main arguments for Oxford, the theory has spawned schismatic variants that have not met with wide acceptance by all Oxfordians, although they have gained much attention.

===Prince Tudor theory===
In a letter written by Looney in 1933, he mentions that Allen and Ward were &quot;advancing certain views respecting Oxford and Queen Eliz. which appear to me extravagant &amp; improbable, in no way strengthen Oxford’s Shakespeare claims, and are likely to bring the whole cause into ridicule.&quot; Allen and Ward believed that they had discovered that Elizabeth and Oxford were lovers and had conceived a child. Allen developed the theory in his 1934 book &quot;Anne Cecil, Elizabeth &amp; Oxford&quot;. He argued that the child was given the name William Hughes, who became an actor under the stage-name &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;. He adopted the name because his father, Oxford, was already using it as a pen-name for his plays. Oxford had borrowed the name from a third Shakespeare, the man of that name from Stratford-upon-Avon, who was a law student at the time, but who was never an actor &quot;or&quot; a writer. Allen later changed his mind about Hughes and decided that the concealed child was the Earl of Southampton, the dedicatee of Shakespeare&#x27;s narrative poems. This secret history, which has become known as the Prince Tudor theory, was covertly represented in Oxford&#x27;s plays and poems and remained hidden until Allen and Ward&#x27;s discoveries. The narrative poems and sonnets had been written by Oxford for his son. &quot;This Star of England&quot; (1952) by Charlton and Dorothy Ogburn included arguments in support of this version of the theory. Their son, Charlton Ogburn Jr, agreed with Looney that the theory was an impediment to the Oxfordian movement and omitted all discussion about it in his own Oxfordian works.

However, the theory was revived and expanded by Elisabeth Sears in &quot;Shakespeare and the Tudor Rose&quot; (2002), and Hank Whittemore in &quot;The Monument&quot; (2005), an analysis of Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets which interprets the poems as a poetic history of Queen Elizabeth, Oxford, and Southampton. Paul Streitz&#x27;s &quot;Oxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth I&quot; (2001) advances a variation on the theory: that Oxford himself was the illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth by her stepfather, Thomas Seymour. Oxford was thus the half-brother of his own son by the queen. Streitz also believes that the queen had children by the Earl of Leicester. These were Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, Mary Sidney and Elizabeth Leighton.

===Attribution of other works to Oxford===

As with other candidates for authorship of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, Oxford&#x27;s advocates have attributed numerous non-Shakespearian works to him. Looney began the process in his 1921 edition of de Vere&#x27;s poetry. He suggested that de Vere was also responsible for some of the literary works credited to Arthur Golding, Anthony Munday and John Lyly. Streitz credits Oxford with the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. Two professors of linguistics have claimed that de Vere wrote not only the works of Shakespeare, but most of what is memorable in English literature during his lifetime, with such names as Edmund Spenser, Christopher Marlowe, Philip Sidney, John Lyly, George Peele, George Gascoigne, Raphael Holinshed, Robert Greene, Thomas Phaer, and Arthur Golding being among dozens of further pseudonyms of de Vere. Ramon Jiménez has credited Oxford with such plays as &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard III&quot; and &quot;Edmund Ironside&quot;.

===Group theories===
Group theories in which Oxford played the principal role as writer, but collaborated with others to create the Shakespeare canon, were adopted by a number of early Oxfordians. Looney himself was willing to concede that Oxford may have been assisted by his son-in-law William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, who perhaps wrote &quot;The Tempest&quot;. B. M. Ward also suggested that Oxford and Derby worked together. In his later writings Percy Allen argued that Oxford led a group of writers, among whom was William Shakespeare. Group theories with Oxford as the principal author or creative &quot;master mind&quot; were also proposed by Gilbert Standen in &quot;Shakespeare Authorship&quot; (1930), Gilbert Slater in &quot;Seven Shakespeares&quot; (1931) and Montagu William Douglas in &quot;Lord Oxford and the Shakespeare Group&quot; (1952).

==Case against Oxfordian theory==

===Methodology of Oxfordian argument===

Specialists in Elizabethan literary history object to the methodology of Oxfordian arguments. In lieu of any evidence of the type commonly used for authorship attribution, Oxfordians discard the methods used by historians and employ other types of arguments to make their case, the most common being supposed parallels between Oxford&#x27;s life and Shakespeare&#x27;s works.

Another is finding cryptic allusions to Oxford&#x27;s supposed play writing in other literary works of the era that to them suggest that his authorship was obvious to those &quot;in the know&quot;. David Kathman writes that their methods are subjective and devoid of any evidential value, because they use a &quot;double standard&quot;. Their arguments are &quot;not taken seriously by Shakespeare scholars because they consistently distort and misrepresent the historical record&quot;, &quot;neglect to provide necessary context&quot; and are in some cases &quot;outright fabrication[s]&quot;. One major evidential objection to the Oxfordian theory is Edward de Vere&#x27;s 1604 death, after which a number of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays are generally believed to have been written. In &quot;The Shakespeare Claimants&quot;, a 1962 examination of the authorship question, H. N. Gibson concluded that &quot;... on analysis the Oxfordian case appears to me a very weak one&quot;.

=== Mainstream objections ===
Mainstream academics have often argued that the Oxford theory is based on snobbery: that anti-Stratfordians reject the idea that the son of a mere tradesman could write the plays and poems of Shakespeare. The Shakespeare Oxford Society has responded that this claim is &quot;a substitute for reasoned responses to Oxfordian evidence and logic&quot; and is merely an &quot;ad hominem&quot; attack.

Mainstream critics further say that, if William Shakespeare were a fraud instead of the true author, the number of people involved in suppressing this information would have made it highly unlikely to succeed. And citing the &quot;testimony of contemporary writers, court records and much else&quot; supporting Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship, Columbia University professor James S. Shapiro says any theory claiming that &quot;there must have been a conspiracy to suppress the truth of de Vere&#x27;s authorship&quot; based on the idea that &quot;the very absence of surviving evidence proves the case&quot; is a logically fatal tautology.

==Circumstantial evidence==

While no documentary evidence connects Oxford (or any alternative author) to the plays of Shakespeare, Oxfordian writers, including Mark Anderson and Charlton Ogburn, say that connection is made by considerable circumstantial evidence inferred from Oxford&#x27;s connections to the Elizabethan theatre and poetry scene; the participation of his family in the printing and publication of the First Folio; his relationship with the Earl of Southampton (believed by most Shakespeare scholars to have been Shakespeare&#x27;s patron); as well as a number of specific incidents and circumstances of Oxford&#x27;s life that Oxfordians say are depicted in the plays themselves.

===Theatre connections===
Oxford was noted for his literary and theatrical patronage, garnering dedications from a wide range of authors. For much of his adult life, Oxford patronised both adult and boy acting companies, as well as performances by musicians, acrobats and performing animals, and in 1583, he was a leaseholder of the first Blackfriars Theatre in London.

===Family connections===
Oxford was related to several literary figures. His mother, Margory Golding, was the sister of the Ovid translator Arthur Golding, and his uncle, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, was the inventor of the English or Shakespearian sonnet form.

The three dedicatees of Shakespeare&#x27;s works (the earls of Southampton, Montgomery and Pembroke) were each proposed as husbands for the three daughters of Edward de Vere. &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; were dedicated to Southampton (whom many scholars have argued was the Fair Youth of the &quot;Sonnets&quot;), and the &quot;First Folio&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays was dedicated to Montgomery (who married Susan de Vere) and Pembroke (who was once engaged to Bridget de Vere).

===Oxford&#x27;s Bible===
In the late 1990s, Roger A. Stritmatter conducted a study of the marked passages found in Edward de Vere&#x27;s Geneva Bible, which is now owned by the Folger Shakespeare Library. The Bible contains 1,028 instances of underlined words or passages and a few hand-written annotations, most of which consist of a single word or fragment. Stritmatter believes about a quarter of the marked passages appear in Shakespeare&#x27;s works as either a theme, allusion, or quotation. Stritmatter grouped the marked passages into eight themes. Arguing that the themes fitted de Vere&#x27;s known interests, he proceeded to link specific themes to passages in Shakespeare. Critics have doubted that any of the underlinings or annotations in the Bible can be reliably attributed to de Vere and not the book&#x27;s other owners prior to its acquisition by the Folger Shakespeare Library in 1925, as well as challenging the looseness of Stritmatter&#x27;s standards for a Biblical allusion in Shakespeare&#x27;s works and arguing that there is no statistical significance to the overlap.

===Stratford connections===

Shakespeare&#x27;s native Avon and Stratford are referred to in two prefatory poems in the 1623 First Folio, one of which refers to Shakespeare as &quot;Swan of Avon&quot; and another to the author&#x27;s &quot;Stratford monument&quot;. Oxfordians say the first of these phrases could refer to one of Edward de Vere&#x27;s manors, Bilton Hall, near the Forest of Arden, in Rugby, on the River Avon. This view was first expressed by Charles Wisner Barrell, who argued that De Vere &quot;kept the place as a literary hideaway where he could carry on his creative work without the interference of his father-in-law, Burghley, and other distractions of Court and city life.&quot; Oxfordians also consider it significant that the nearest town to the parish of Hackney, where de Vere later lived and was buried, was also named Stratford. Mainstream scholar Irvin Matus demonstrated that Oxford sold the Bilton house in 1580, having previously rented it out, making it unlikely that Ben Jonson&#x27;s 1623 poem would identify Oxford by referring to a property he once owned, but never lived in, and sold 43 years earlier. Nor is there any evidence of a monument to Oxford in Stratford, London, or anywhere else; his widow provided for the creation of one at Hackney in her 1613 will, but there is no evidence that it was ever erected.

===Oxford&#x27;s annuity===

Oxfordians also believe that Rev. Dr. John Ward&#x27;s 1662 diary entry stating that Shakespeare wrote two plays a year &quot;and for that had an allowance so large that he spent at the rate of £1,000 a year&quot; as a critical piece of evidence, since Queen Elizabeth I gave Oxford an annuity of exactly £1,000 beginning in 1586 that was continued until his death. Ogburn wrote that the annuity was granted &quot;under mysterious circumstances&quot;, and Anderson suggests it was granted because of Oxford&#x27;s writing patriotic plays for government propaganda. However, the documentary evidence indicates that the allowance was meant to relieve Oxford&#x27;s embarrassed financial situation caused by the ruination of his estate.

===Oxford&#x27;s travels and the settings of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays===
Almost half of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays are set in Italy, many of them containing details of Italian laws, customs, and culture which Oxfordians believe could only have been obtained by personal experiences in Italy, and especially in Venice. The author of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Looney believed, &quot;knew Italy first hand and was touched with the life and spirit of the country&quot;. This argument had earlier been used by supporters of the Earl of Rutland and the Earl of Derby as authorship candidates, both of whom had also travelled on the continent of Europe. Oxfordian William Farina refers to Shakespeare&#x27;s apparent knowledge of the Jewish ghetto, Venetian architecture and laws in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, especially the city&#x27;s &quot;notorious Alien Statute&quot;. Historical documents confirm that Oxford lived in Venice, and travelled for over a year through Italy. He disliked the country, writing in a letter to Lord Burghley dated 24 September 1575, &quot;I am glad I have seen it, and I care not ever to see it any more&quot;. Still, he remained in Italy for another six months, leaving Venice in March 1576. According to Anderson, Oxford definitely visited Venice, Padua, Milan, Genoa, Palermo, Florence, Siena and Naples, and probably passed through Messina, Mantua and Verona, all cities used as settings by Shakespeare. In testimony before the Venetian Inquisition, Edward de Vere was said to be fluent in Italian.

However, some Shakespeare scholars say that Shakespeare gets many details of Italian life wrong, including the laws and urban geography of Venice. Kenneth Gross writes that &quot;the play itself knows nothing about the Venetian ghetto; we get no sense of a legally separate region of Venice where Shylock must dwell.&quot; Scott McCrea describes the setting as &quot;a nonrealistic Venice&quot; and the laws invoked by Portia as part of the &quot;imaginary world of the play&quot;, inconsistent with actual legal practice. Charles Ross points out that Shakespeare&#x27;s Alien Statute bears little resemblance to any Italian law. For later plays such as &quot;Othello&quot;, Shakespeare probably used Lewes Lewknor&#x27;s 1599 English translation of Gasparo Contarini&#x27;s &quot;The Commonwealth and Government of Venice&quot; for some details about Venice&#x27;s laws and customs.

Shakespeare derived much of this material from John Florio, an Italian scholar living in England who was later thanked by Ben Jonson for helping him get Italian details right for his play &quot;Volpone&quot;. Keir Elam has traced Shakespeare&#x27;s Italian idioms in &quot;Shrew&quot; and some of the dialogue to Florio&#x27;s &quot;Second Fruits&quot;, a bilingual introduction to Italian language and culture published in 1591. Jason Lawrence believes that Shakespeare’s Italian dialogue in the play derives &quot;almost entirely&quot; from Florio’s &quot;First Fruits&quot; (1578). He also believes that Shakespeare became more proficient in reading the language as set out in Florio’s manuals, as evidenced by his increasing use of Florio and other Italian sources for writing the plays.

===Oxford&#x27;s education and knowledge of court life===
In 1567 Oxford was admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn, one of the Inns of Court which Justice Shallow reminisces about in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;. Sobran observes that the Sonnets &quot;abound not only in legal terms – more than 200 – but also in elaborate legal conceits.&quot; These terms include: &quot;allege, auditor, defects, exchequer, forfeit, heirs, impeach, lease, moiety, recompense, render, sureties,&quot; and &quot;usage&quot;. Shakespeare also uses the legal term &quot;quietus&quot; (final settlement) in Sonnet 134, the last Fair Youth sonnet.

Regarding Oxford&#x27;s knowledge of court life, which Oxfordians believe is reflected throughout the plays, mainstream scholars say that any special knowledge of the aristocracy appearing in the plays can be more easily explained by Shakespeare&#x27;s life-time of performances before nobility and royalty, and possibly, as Gibson theorises, &quot;by visits to his patron&#x27;s house, as Marlowe visited Walsingham.&quot;

==Oxford&#x27;s literary reputation==

===Oxford&#x27;s lyric poetry===
Some of Oxford&#x27;s lyric works have survived. Steven W. May, an authority on Oxford&#x27;s poetry, attributes sixteen poems definitely, and four possibly, to Oxford noting that these are probably &quot;only a good sampling&quot; as &quot;both Webbe (1586) and Puttenham (1589) rank him first among the courtier poets, an eminence he probably would not have been granted, despite his reputation as a patron, by virtue of a mere handful of lyrics&quot;.

May describes Oxford as a &quot;competent, fairly experimental poet working in the established modes of mid-century lyric verse&quot; and his poetry as &quot;examples of the standard varieties of mid-Elizabethan amorous lyric&quot;. In 2004, May wrote that Oxford&#x27;s poetry was &quot;one man&#x27;s contribution to the rhetorical mainstream of an evolving Elizabethan poetic&quot; and challenged readers to distinguish any of it from &quot;the output of his mediocre mid-century contemporaries&quot;. C. S. Lewis wrote that de Vere&#x27;s poetry shows &quot;a faint talent&quot;, but is &quot;for the most part undistinguished and verbose.&quot;

====Comparisons to Shakespeare&#x27;s work====

In the opinion of J. Thomas Looney, as &quot;far as forms of versification are concerned De Vere presents just that rich variety which is so noticeable in Shakespeare; and almost all the forms he employs we find reproduced in the Shakespeare work.&quot; Oxfordian Louis P. Bénézet created the &quot;Bénézet test&quot;, a collage of lines from Shakespeare and lines he thought were representative of Oxford, challenging non-specialists to tell the difference between the two authors. May notes that Looney compared various motifs, rhetorical devices and phrases with certain Shakespeare works to find similarities he said were &quot;the most crucial in the piecing together of the case&quot;, but that for some of those &quot;crucial&quot; examples Looney used six poems mistakenly attributed to Oxford that were actually written by Greene, Campion, and Greville. Bénézet also used two lines from Greene that he thought were Oxford&#x27;s, while succeeding Oxfordians, including Charles Wisner Barrell, have also misattributed poems to Oxford. &quot;This on-going confusion of Oxford&#x27;s genuine verse with that of at least three other poets&quot;, writes May, &quot;illustrates the wholesale failure of the basic Oxfordian methodology.&quot;

According to a computerised textual comparison developed by the Claremont Shakespeare Clinic, the styles of Shakespeare and Oxford were found to be &quot;light years apart&quot;, and the odds of Oxford having written Shakespeare were reported as &quot;lower than the odds of getting hit by lightning&quot;. Furthermore, while the First Folio shows traces of a dialect identical to Shakespeare&#x27;s, the Earl of Oxford, raised in Essex, spoke an East Anglian dialect. John Shahan and Richard Whalen condemned the Claremont study, calling it &quot;apples to oranges&quot;, and noting that the study did not compare Oxford&#x27;s songs to Shakespeare&#x27;s songs, did not compare a clean unconfounded sample of Oxford&#x27;s poems with Shakespeare&#x27;s poems, and charged that the students under Elliott and Valenza&#x27;s supervision incorrectly assumed that Oxford&#x27;s youthful verse was representative of his mature poetry.

Joseph Sobran&#x27;s book, &quot;Alias Shakespeare&quot;, includes Oxford&#x27;s known poetry in an appendix with what he considers extensive verbal parallels with the work of Shakespeare, and he argues that Oxford&#x27;s poetry is comparable in quality to some of Shakespeare&#x27;s early work, such as &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;. Other Oxfordians say that de Vere&#x27;s extant work is that of a young man and should be considered juvenilia, while May believes that all the evidence dates his surviving work to his early 20s and later.

===Contemporary reception===
Four contemporary critics praise Oxford as a poet and a playwright, three of them within his lifetime:

# William Webbe&#x27;s &quot;Discourse of English Poetrie&quot; (1586) surveys and criticises the early Elizabethan poets and their works. He parenthetically mentions those of Elizabeth&#x27;s court, and names Oxford as &quot;the most excellent&quot; among them.
# The &quot;Arte of English Poesie&quot; (1589), attributed to George Puttenham, includes Oxford on a list of courtier poets and prints some of his verses as exemplars of &quot;his excellencie and wit.&quot; He also praises Oxford and Richard Edwardes as playwrights, saying that they &quot;deserve the hyest price&quot; for the works of &quot;Comedy and Enterlude&quot; that he has seen.
# Francis Meres&#x27; 1598 &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; mentions both Oxford and Shakespeare as among several playwrights who are &quot;the best for comedy amongst us&quot;.
# Henry Peacham&#x27;s 1622 &quot;The Compleat Gentleman&quot; includes Oxford on a list of courtier and would-be courtier Elizabethan poets.

Mainstream scholarship characterises the extravagant praise for de Vere&#x27;s poetry more as a convention of flattery than honest appreciation of literary merit. Alan Nelson, de Vere&#x27;s documentary biographer, writes that &quot;[c]ontemporary observers such as Harvey, Webbe, Puttenham and Meres clearly exaggerated Oxford&#x27;s talent in deference to his rank.&quot;

===Perceived allusions to Oxford as a concealed writer===
Before the advent of copyright, anonymous and pseudonymous publication was a common practice in the sixteenth century publishing world, and a passage in the &quot;Arte of English Poesie&quot; (1589), an anonymously published work itself, mentions in passing that literary figures in the court who wrote &quot;commendably well&quot; circulated their poetry only among their friends, &quot;as if it were a discredit for a gentleman to seem learned&quot; (Book 1, Chapter 8). In another passage 23 chapters later, the author (probably George Puttenham) speaks of aristocratic writers who, if their writings were made public, would appear to be excellent. It is in this passage that Oxford appears on a list of poets.

According to Daniel Wright, these combined passages confirm that Oxford was one of the concealed writers in the Elizabethan court. Critics of this view argue that neither Oxford nor any other writer is here identified as a concealed writer, but as the first in a list of &quot;known&quot; modern writers whose works have already been &quot;made public&quot;, &quot;of which number is first&quot; Oxford, adding to the publicly acknowledged literary tradition dating back to Geoffrey Chaucer. Other critics interpret the passage to mean that the courtly writers and their works are known within courtly circles, but not to the general public. In either case, neither Oxford nor anyone else is identified as a hidden writer or one that used a pseudonym.

Oxfordians argue that at the time of the passage&#x27;s composition (pre-1589), the writers referenced were not in print, and interpret Puttenham&#x27;s passage (that the noblemen preferred to &#x27;suppress&#x27; their work to avoid the discredit of appearing learned) to mean that they were &#x27;concealed&#x27;. They cite Sir Philip Sidney, none of whose poetry was published until after his premature death, as an example. Similarly, up to 1589 nothing by Greville was in print, and only one of Walter Raleigh&#x27;s works had been published.

Critics point out that six of the nine poets listed had appeared in print under their own names long before 1589, including a number of Oxford&#x27;s poems in printed miscellanies, and the first poem published under Oxford&#x27;s name was printed in 1572, 17 years before Puttenham&#x27;s book was published. Several other contemporary authors name Oxford as a poet, and Puttenham himself quotes one of Oxford&#x27;s verses elsewhere in the book, referring to him by name as the author, so Oxfordians misread Puttenham.

Oxfordians also believe other texts refer to the Edward de Vere as a concealed writer. They argue that satirist John Marston&#x27;s &quot;Scourge of Villanie&quot; (1598) contains further cryptic allusions to Oxford, named as &quot;Mutius&quot;. Marston expert Arnold Davenport believes that Mutius is the bishop-poet Joseph Hall and that Marston is criticising Hall&#x27;s satires.

There is a description of the figure of Oxford in &quot;The Revenge of Bussy D&#x27;Ambois&quot;, a 1613 play by George Chapman, who has been suggested as the Rival Poet of Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets. Chapman describes Oxford as &quot;Rare and most absolute&quot; in form and says he was &quot;of spirit passing great / Valiant and learn’d, and liberal as the sun&quot;. He adds that he &quot;spoke and writ sweetly&quot; of both learned subjects and matters of state (&quot;public weal&quot;).

==Chronology of the plays and Oxford&#x27;s 1604 death==
For mainstream Shakespearian scholars, the most compelling evidence against Oxford (besides the historical evidence for William Shakespeare) is his death in 1604, since the generally accepted chronology of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays places the composition of approximately twelve of the plays after that date. Critics often cite &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;, for example, as having been written after 1604.

The exact dates of the composition of most of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays are uncertain, although David Bevington says it is a &#x27;virtually unanimous&#x27; opinion among teachers and scholars of Shakespeare that the canon of late plays depicts an artistic journey that extends well beyond 1604. Evidence for this includes allusions to historical events and literary sources which postdate 1604, as well as Shakespeare&#x27;s adaptation of his style to accommodate Jacobean literary tastes and the changing membership of the King&#x27;s Men and their different venues.

Oxfordians say that the conventional composition dates for the plays were developed by mainstream scholars to fit within Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime and that no evidence exists that any plays were written after 1604. Anderson argues that all of the Jacobean plays were written before 1604, selectively citing non-Oxfordian scholars like Alfred Harbage, Karl Elze, and Andrew Cairncross to bolster his case. Anderson notes that from 1593 through 1603, the publication of new plays appeared at the rate of two per year, and whenever an inferior or pirated text was published, it was typically followed by a genuine text described on the title page as &quot;newly augmented&quot; or &quot;corrected&quot;. After the publication of the Q1 and Q2 &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 1603, no new plays were published until 1608. Anderson observes that, &quot;After 1604, the &#x27;newly correct[ing]&#x27; and &#x27;augment[ing]&#x27; stops. Once again, the Shake-speare [&quot;sic&quot;] enterprise appears to have shut down&quot;.

===Notable silences===

Because Shakespeare lived until 1616, Oxfordians question why, if he were the author, did he not eulogise Queen Elizabeth at her death in 1603 or Henry, Prince of Wales, at his in 1612. They believe Oxford&#x27;s 1604 death provides the explanation. In an age when such actions were expected, Shakespeare also failed to memorialise the coronation of James I in 1604, the marriage of Princess Elizabeth in 1612, and the investiture of Prince Charles as the new Prince of Wales in 1613.

Anderson contends that Shakespeare refers to the latest scientific discoveries and events through the end of the 16th century, but &quot;is mute about science after de Vere’s [Oxford’s] death in 1604&quot;. He believes that the absence of any mention of the spectacular supernova of October 1604 or Kepler’s revolutionary 1609 study of planetary orbits are especially noteworthy.

===The move to the Blackfriars===

Professor Jonathan Bate writes that Oxfordians cannot &quot;provide any explanation for ... technical changes attendant on the King&#x27;s Men&#x27;s move to the Blackfriars theatre four years after their candidate&#x27;s death ... Unlike the Globe, the Blackfriars was an indoor playhouse&quot; and so required plays with frequent breaks in order to replace the candles it used for lighting. &quot;The plays written after Shakespeare&#x27;s company began using the Blackfriars in 1608, &quot;Cymbeline&quot; and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; for instance, have what most ... of the earlier plays do not have: a carefully planned five-act structure&quot;. If new Shakespearian plays were being written especially for presentation at the Blackfriars&#x27; theatre after 1608, they could not have been written by Edward de Vere.

Oxfordians argue that Oxford was well acquainted with the Blackfriars Theatre, having been a leaseholder of the venue, and note that the &quot;assumption&quot; that Shakespeare wrote plays for the Blackfriars is not universally accepted, citing Shakespearian scholars such as A. Nicoll who said that &quot;all available evidence is either completely negative or else runs directly counter to such a supposition&quot; and Harley Granville-Barker, who stated &quot;Shakespeare did not write (except for Henry V) five-act plays at any stage of his career. The five-act structure was formalized in the First Folio, and is inauthentic&quot;.

===Shakespeare&#x27;s late collaborations===

Further, attribution studies have shown that certain plays in the canon were written by two or three hands, which Oxfordians believe is explained by these plays being either drafted earlier than conventionally believed, or simply revised/completed by others after Oxford&#x27;s death. Shapiro calls this a &#x27;nightmare&#x27; for Oxfordians, implying a &#x27;jumble sale scenario&#x27; for his literary remains long after his death.

===Identification of earlier works with Shakespeare plays===

Some Oxfordians have identified titles or descriptions of lost works from Oxford&#x27;s lifetime that suggest a thematic similarity to a particular Shakespearian play and asserted that they were earlier versions. For example, in 1732, the antiquarian Francis Peck published in &quot;Desiderata Curiosa&quot; a list of documents in his possession that he intended to print someday. They included &quot;a pleasant conceit of Vere, earl of Oxford, discontented at the rising of a mean gentleman in the English court, circa 1580.&quot; Peck never published his archives, which are now lost. To Anderson, Peck&#x27;s description suggests that this conceit is &quot;arguably an early draft of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.&quot;

=== Contemporary references to Shakespeare as alive or dead ===
Oxfordian writers say some literary allusions imply that the playwright and poet died prior to 1609, when &quot;Shake-Speares Sonnets&quot; appeared with the epithet &quot;our ever-living poet&quot; in its dedication. They claim that the phrase &quot;ever-living&quot; rarely, if ever, referred to a living person, but instead was used to refer to the eternal soul of the deceased. Bacon, Derby, Neville, and William Shakespeare all lived well past the 1609 publication of the Sonnets.

However, Don Foster, in his study of Early Modern uses of the phrase &quot;ever-living&quot;, argues that the phrase most frequently refers to God or other supernatural beings, suggesting that the dedication calls upon God to bless the living begetter (writer) of the sonnets. He states that the initials &quot;W. H.&quot; were a misprint for &quot;W. S.&quot; or &quot;W. SH&quot;. Bate thinks it a misprint as well, but he thinks it &quot;improbable&quot; that the phrase refers to God and suggests that the &quot;ever-living poet&quot; might be &quot;a great dead English poet who had written on the great theme of poetic immortality&quot;, such as Sir Philip Sidney or Edmund Spenser.

Joseph Sobran, in &quot;Alias Shakespeare,&quot; argued that in 1607 William Barksted, a minor poet and playwright, implies in his poem &quot;Mirrha the Mother of Adonis&quot; that Shakespeare was already deceased. Shakespeare scholars explain that Sobran has simply misread Barksted’s poem, the last stanza of which is a comparison of Barksted’s poem to Shakespeare’s &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, and has mistaken the grammar also, which makes it clear that Barksted is referring to Shakespeare’s &quot;song&quot; in the past tense, not Shakespeare himself. This context is obvious when the rest of the stanza is included.

Against the Oxford theory are several references to Shakespeare, later than 1604, which imply that the author was then still alive. Scholars point to a poem written circa 1620 by a student at Oxford, William Basse, that mentioned the author Shakespeare died in 1616, which is the year Shakespeare deceased and not Edward de Vere.

===Dates of composition===

====&quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;====

Tom Veal has noted that the early play &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; reveals no familiarity on the playwright&#x27;s part with Italy other than &quot;a few place names and the scarcely recondite fact that the inhabitants were Roman Catholics.&quot; For example, the play&#x27;s Verona is situated on a tidal river and has a duke, and none of the characters have distinctly Italian names like in the later plays. Therefore, if the play was written by Oxford, it must have been before he visited Italy in 1575. However, the play&#x27;s principal source, the Spanish &quot;Diana Enamorada&quot;, would not be translated into French or English until 1578, meaning that someone basing a play on it that early could only have read it in the original Spanish, and there is no evidence that Oxford spoke this language. Furthermore, Veal argues, the only explanation for the verbal parallels with the English translation of 1582 would be that the translator saw the play performed and echoed it in his translation, which he describes as &quot;not an impossible theory but far from a plausible one.&quot;

====&quot;Hamlet&quot;====
The composition date of &quot;Hamlet&quot; has been frequently disputed. Several surviving references indicate that a Hamlet-like play was well-known throughout the 1590s, well before the traditional period of composition (1599–1601). Most scholars refer to this lost early play as the Ur-Hamlet; the earliest reference is in 1589. A 1594 performance record of &quot;Hamlet&quot; appears in Philip Henslowe&#x27;s diary, and Thomas Lodge wrote of it in 1596.

Oxfordian researchers believe that the play is an early version of Shakespeare&#x27;s own play, and point to the fact that Shakespeare&#x27;s version survives in three quite different early texts, Q1 (1603), Q2 (1604) and F (1623), suggesting the possibility that it was revised by the author over a period of many years.

====&quot;Macbeth&quot;====

Scholars contend that the composition date of &quot;Macbeth&quot; is one of the most overwhelming pieces of evidence against the Oxfordian position; the vast majority of critics believe the play was written in the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot. This plot was brought to light on 5 November 1605, a year after Oxford died. In particular, scholars identify the porter&#x27;s lines about &quot;equivocation&quot; and treason as an allusion to the trial of Henry Garnet in 1606. Oxfordians respond that the concept of &quot;equivocation&quot; was the subject of a 1583 tract by Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s chief councillor (and Oxford&#x27;s father-in-law) Lord Burghley, as well as of the 1584 &quot;Doctrine of Equivocation&quot; by the Spanish prelate Martín de Azpilcueta, which was disseminated across Europe and into England in the 1590s.

====&quot;Coriolanus&quot;====

Shakespearian scholar David Haley asserts that if Edward de Vere had written &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, he &quot;must have foreseen the Midland Revolt grain riots [of 1607] reported in Coriolanus&quot;, possible topical allusions in the play that most Shakespearians accept.

====&quot;The Tempest&quot;====

The play that can be dated within a fourteen-month period is &quot;The Tempest&quot;. This play has long been believed to have been inspired by the 1609 wreck at Bermuda, then feared by mariners as the &quot;Isle of the Devils&quot;, of the flagship of the Virginia Company, the Sea Venture, while leading the Third Supply to relieve Jamestown in the Colony of Virginia. The Sea Venture was captained by Christopher Newport, and carried the Admiral of the company&#x27;s fleet, Sir George Somers (for whom the archipelago would subsequently be named &quot;The Somers Isles&quot;). The survivors spent nine months in Bermuda before most completed the journey to Jamestown on 23 May 1610 aboard two new ships built from scratch. One of the survivors was the newly-appointed Governor, Sir Thomas Gates. Jamestown, then little more than a rudimentary fort, was found in such a poor condition, with the majority of the previous settlers dead or dying, that Gates and Somers decided to abandon the settlement and the continent, returning everyone to England. However, with the company believing all aboard the Sea Venture dead, a new governor, Baron De La Warr, had been sent with the Fourth Supply fleet, which arrived on 10 June 1610 as Jamestown was being abandoned.

De la Warr remained in Jamestown as Governor, while Gates returned to England (and Somers to Bermuda), arriving in September, 1610. The news of the survival of the Sea Venture&#x27;s passengers and crew caused a great sensation in England. Two accounts were published: Sylvester Jordain&#x27;s &quot;A Discovery of the Barmvdas, Otherwise Called the Ile of Divels&quot;, in October, 1610, and &quot;A True Declaration of the Estate of the Colonie in Virginia&quot; a month later. The &quot;True Reportory of the Wrack, and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates Knight&quot;, an account by William Strachey dated 15 July 1610, returned to England with Gates in the form of a letter which was circulated privately until its eventual publication in 1625. Shakespeare had multiple contacts to the circle of people amongst whom the letter circulated, including to Strachey. &quot;The Tempest&quot; shows clear evidence that he had read and relied on Jordain and especially Strachey. The play shares premise, basic plot, and many details of the Sea Venture&#x27;s wrecking and the adventures of the survivors, as well as specific details and linguistics. A detailed comparative analysis shows the &quot;Declaration&quot; to have been the primary source from which the play was drawn. This firmly dates the writing of the play to the months between Gates&#x27; return to England and 1 November 1611 (when the first recorded performance occurred).

Oxfordians have dealt with this problem in several ways. Looney expelled the play from the canon, arguing that its style and the &quot;dreary negativism&quot; it promoted were inconsistent with Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;essentially positivist&quot; soul, and so could not have been written by Oxford. Later Oxfordians have generally abandoned this argument; this has made severing the connection of the play with the wreck of the Sea Venture a priority amongst Oxfordians. A variety of attacks have been directed on the links. These include attempting to cast doubt on whether the &quot;Declaration&quot; travelled back to England with Gates, whether Gates travelled back to England early enough, whether the lowly Shakespeare would have had access to the lofty circles in which the &quot;Declaration&quot; was circulated, to understating the points of similarity between the Sea Venture wreck and the accounts of it, on the one hand, and the play on the other. Oxfordians have even claimed that the writers of the first-hand accounts of the real wreck based them on &quot;The Tempest&quot;, or, at least, the same antiquated sources that Shakespeare, or rather Oxford, is imagined to have used exclusively, including Richard Eden&#x27;s &quot;The Decades of the New Worlde Or West India&quot; (1555) and Desiderius Erasmus&#x27;s &quot;Naufragium&quot;/&quot;The Shipwreck&quot; (1523). Alden Vaughan commented in 2008 that &quot;[t]he argument that Shakespeare could have gotten every thematic thread, every detail of the storm, and every similarity of word and phrase from other sources stretches credulity to the limits.&quot;

====&quot;Henry VIII&quot;====

Oxfordians note that while the conventional dating for &quot;Henry VIII&quot; is 1610–13, the majority of 18th and 19th century scholars, including notables such as Samuel Johnson, Lewis Theobald, George Steevens, Edmond Malone, and James Halliwell-Phillipps, placed the composition of &quot;Henry VIII&quot; prior to 1604, as they believed Elizabeth&#x27;s execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (the then king James I&#x27;s mother) made any vigorous defence of the Tudors politically inappropriate in the England of James I. Though it is described as a new play by two witnesses in 1613, Oxfordians argue that this refers to the fact it was new on stage, having its first production in that year.

== Oxfordian cryptology ==

Although searching Shakespeare&#x27;s works for encrypted clues supposedly left by the true author is associated mainly with the Baconian theory, such arguments are often made by Oxfordians as well. Early Oxfordians found many references to Oxford&#x27;s family name &quot;Vere&quot; in the plays and poems, in supposed puns on words such as &quot;ever&quot; (E. Vere). In &quot;The De Vere Code&quot;, a book by English actor Jonathan Bond, the author believes that Thomas Thorpe&#x27;s 30-word dedication to the original publication of Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets contains six simple encryptions which conclusively establish de Vere as the author of the poems. He also writes that the alleged encryptions settle the question of the identity of &quot;the Fair Youth&quot; as Henry Wriothesley and contain striking references to the sonnets themselves and de Vere&#x27;s relationship to Sir Philip Sidney and Ben Jonson.

Similarly, a 2009 article in the Oxfordian journal &quot;Brief Chronicles&quot; noted that Francis Meres in &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; compares 17 named English poets to 16 named classical poets. Writing that Meres was obsessed with numerology, the authors propose that the numbers should be symmetrical, and that careful readers are meant to infer that Meres knew two of the English poets (viz., Oxford and Shakespeare) to actually be one and the same.

== Parallels with the plays ==
Literary scholars say that the idea that an author&#x27;s work must reflect his or her life is a Modernist assumption not held by Elizabethan writers, and that biographical interpretations of literature are unreliable in attributing authorship. Further, such lists of similarities between incidents in the plays and the life of an aristocrat are flawed arguments because similar lists have been drawn up for many competing candidates, such as Francis Bacon and William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby. Harold Love writes that &quot;The very fact that their application has produced so many rival claimants demonstrates their unreliability,&quot; and Jonathan Bate writes that the Oxfordian biographical method &quot;is in essence no different from the cryptogram, since Shakespeare&#x27;s range of characters and plots, both familial and political, is so vast that it would be possible to find in the plays &#x27;self-portraits&#x27; of ... anybody one cares to think of.&quot;

Despite this, Oxfordians list numerous incidents in Oxford&#x27;s life that they say parallel those in many of the Shakespeare plays. Most notable among these, they say, are certain similar incidents found in Oxford&#x27;s biography and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, which includes a well-known robbery scene with uncanny parallels to a real-life incident involving Oxford.

===&quot;Hamlet&quot;===

Most Oxfordians consider &quot;Hamlet&quot; the play most easily seen as portraying Oxford&#x27;s life story, though mainstream scholars say that incidents from the lives of other contemporary figures such as King James or the Earl of Essex, fit the play just as closely, if not more so.

Hamlet&#x27;s father was murdered and his mother made an &quot;o&#x27;er-hasty marriage&quot; less than two months later. Oxfordians see a parallel with Oxford&#x27;s life, as Oxford&#x27;s father died at the age of 46 on 3 August 1562, although not before making a will six days earlier, and his stepmother remarried within 15 months, although exactly when is unknown.

Another frequently-cited parallel involves Hamlet&#x27;s revelation in Act IV that he was earlier taken captive by pirates. On Oxford&#x27;s return from Europe in 1576, he encountered a cavalry division outside of Paris that was being led by a German duke, and his ship was hijacked by pirates who robbed him and left him stripped to his shirt, and who might have murdered him had not one of them recognised him. Anderson notes that &quot;[n]either the encounter with Fortinbras&#x27; army nor Hamlet&#x27;s brush with buccaneers appears in any of the play&#x27;s sources – to the puzzlement of numerous literary critics.&quot;

====Polonius====
Such speculation often identifies the character of Polonius as a caricature of Lord Burghley, Oxford&#x27;s guardian from the age of 12.

In the First Quarto the character was not named Polonius, but Corambis. Ogburn writes that &quot;Cor ambis&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;two-hearted&quot; (a view not independently supported by Latinists). He says the name is a swipe &quot;at Burghley&#x27;s motto, &quot;Cor unum, via una&quot;, or &#x27;one heart, one way.&#x27;&quot; Scholars suggest that it derives from the Latin phrase &quot;crambe repetita&quot; meaning &quot;reheated cabbage&quot;, which was expanded in Elizabethan usage to &quot;&quot;Crambe bis&quot; posita mors est&quot; (&quot;twice served cabbage is deadly&quot;), which implies &quot;a boring old man&quot; who spouts trite rehashed ideas. Similar variants such as &quot;Crambo&quot; and &quot;Corabme&quot; appear in Latin-English dictionaries at the time.

===Bed trick===

In his &quot;Memoires&quot; (1658), Francis Osborne writes of &quot;the last great &quot;Earle of Oxford&quot;, whose &quot;Lady&quot; was brought to his bed under the notion of his &quot;Mistris&quot;, and from such a virtuous deceit she (Oxford&#x27;s youngest daughter) is said to proceed&quot; (p. 79).

Such a bed trick has been a dramatic convention since antiquity and was used more than 40 times by every major playwright in the Early Modern theatre era except for Ben Jonson. Thomas Middleton used it five times and Shakespeare and James Shirley used it four times. Shakespeare&#x27;s use of it in &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; followed his sources for the plays (stories by Boccaccio and Cinthio); nevertheless Oxfordians say that de Vere was drawn to these stories because they &quot;paralleled his own&quot;, based on Osborne&#x27;s anecdote.

===Earls of Oxford in the histories===

Oxfordians claim that flattering treatment of Oxford&#x27;s ancestors in Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays is evidence of his authorship. Shakespeare omitted the character of the traitorous Robert de Vere, 3rd Earl of Oxford in &quot;The Life and Death of King John&quot;, and the character of the 12th Earl of Oxford is given a much more prominent role in &quot;Henry V&quot; than his limited involvement in the actual history of the times would allow. The 12th Earl is given an even more prominent role in the non-Shakespearian play &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry the fifth&quot;. Some Oxfordians argue that this was another play written by Oxford, based on the exaggerated role it gave to the 11th Earl of Oxford.

J. Thomas Looney found John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford is &quot;hardly mentioned except to be praised&quot; in &quot;Henry VI, Part Three&quot;; the play ahistorically depicts him participating in the Battle of Tewkesbury and being captured. Oxfordians, such as Dorothy and Charlton Ogburn, believe Shakespeare created such a role for the 13th Earl because it was the easiest way Edward de Vere could have &quot;advertised his loyalty to the Tudor Queen&quot; and remind her of &quot;the historic part borne by the Earls of Oxford in defeating the usurpers and restoring the Lancastrians to power&quot;. Looney also notes that in &quot;Richard III&quot;, when the future Henry VII appears, the same Earl of Oxford is &quot;by his side; and it is Oxford who, as premier nobleman, replies first to the king&#x27;s address to his followers&quot;.

Non-Oxfordian writers do not see any evidence of partiality for the de Vere family in the plays. Richard de Vere, 11th Earl of Oxford, who plays a prominent role in the anonymous &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry V&quot;, does not appear in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;, nor is he even mentioned. In &quot;Richard III&quot;, Oxford&#x27;s reply to the king noted by Looney is a mere two lines, the only lines he speaks in the play. He has a much more prominent role in the non-Shakespearian play &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard III&quot;. On these grounds the scholar Benjamin Griffin argues that the non-Shakespearian plays, the &quot;Famous Victories&quot; and &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, are the ones connected to Oxford, possibly written for Oxford&#x27;s Men. Oxfordian Charlton Ogburn Jr. argues that the role of the Earls of Oxford was played down in &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot; to maintain Oxford&#x27;s nominal anonymity. This is because &quot;It would not do to have a performance of one of his plays at Court greeted with ill-suppressed knowing chuckles.&quot;

===Oxford&#x27;s finances===

In 1577 the Company of Cathay was formed to support Martin Frobisher&#x27;s hunt for the Northwest Passage, although Frobisher and his investors quickly became distracted by reports of gold at Hall’s Island. With thoughts of an impending Canadian gold-rush and trusting in the financial advice of Michael Lok, the treasurer of the company, de Vere signed a bond for £3,000 in order to invest £1,000 and to assume £2,000 worth – about half – of Lok&#x27;s personal investment in the enterprise. Oxfordians say this is similar to Antonio in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, who was indebted to Shylock for 3,000 ducats against the successful return of his vessels.

Oxfordians also note that when de Vere travelled through Venice, he borrowed 500 crowns from a Baptista Nigrone. In Padua, he borrowed from a man named Pasquino Spinola. In &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Kate&#x27;s father is described as a man &quot;rich in crowns.&quot; He, too, is from Padua, and his name is Baptista Minola, which Oxfordians take to be a conflation of Baptista Nigrone and Pasquino Spinola.

When the character of Antipholus of Ephesus in &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; tells his servant to go out and buy some rope, the servant (Dromio) replies, &quot;I buy a thousand pounds a year! I buy a rope!&quot; (Act 4, scene 1). The meaning of Dromio’s line has not been satisfactorily explained by critics, but Oxfordians say the line is somehow connected to the fact that de Vere was given a £1,000 annuity by the Queen, later continued by King James.

===Marriage and affairs===
Oxfordians see Oxford&#x27;s marriage to Anne Cecil, Lord Burghley&#x27;s daughter, paralleled in such plays as &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

Oxford&#x27;s illicit congress with Anne Vavasour resulted in an intermittent series of street battles between the Knyvet clan, led by Anne&#x27;s uncle, Sir Thomas Knyvet, and Oxford’s men. As in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, this imbroglio produced three deaths and several other injuries. The feud was finally put to an end only by the intervention of the Queen.

===Oxford&#x27;s criminal associations===

In May 1573, in a letter to Lord Burghley, two of Oxford&#x27;s former employees accused three of Oxford&#x27;s friends of attacking them on &quot;the highway from Gravesend to Rochester.&quot; In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, Falstaff and three roguish friends of Prince Hal also waylay unwary travellers at Gad&#x27;s Hill, which is on the highway from Gravesend to Rochester. Scott McCrea says that there is little similarity between the two events, since the crime described in the letter is unlikely to have occurred near Gad&#x27;s Hill and was not a robbery, but rather an attempted shooting. Mainstream writers also say that this episode derives from an earlier anonymous play, &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry V&quot;, which was Shakespeare&#x27;s source. Some Oxfordians argue that &quot;The Famous Victories&quot; was written by Oxford, based on the exaggerated role it gave to the 11th Earl of Oxford.

==Parallels with the sonnets and poems==
In 1609, a volume of 154 linked poems was published under the title &quot;SHAKE-SPEARES SONNETS&quot;. Oxfordians believe the title (&quot;Shake-Speares Sonnets&quot;) suggests a finality indicating that it was a completed body of work with no further sonnets expected, and consider the differences of opinion among Shakespearian scholars as to whether the Sonnets are fictional or autobiographical to be a serious problem facing orthodox scholars. Joseph Sobran questions why Shakespeare (who lived until 1616) failed to publish a corrected and authorised edition if they are fiction, as well as why they fail to match Shakespeare&#x27;s life story if they are autobiographic. According to Sobran and other researchers, the themes and personal circumstances expounded by the author of the Sonnets are remarkably similar to Oxford&#x27;s biography.

===The Fair Youth, the Dark Lady, and the Rival Poet===
The focus of the 154 sonnet series appears to narrate the author&#x27;s relationships with three characters: the Fair Youth, the Dark Lady or Mistress, and the Rival Poet. Beginning with Looney, most Oxfordians (exceptions are Percy Allen and Louis Bénézet) believe that the &quot;Fair Youth&quot; referred to in the early sonnets refers to Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, Oxford&#x27;s peer and prospective son-in-law. The Dark Lady is believed by some Oxfordians to be Anne Vavasour, Oxford&#x27;s mistress who bore him a son out of wedlock. A case was made by the Oxfordian Peter R. Moore that the Rival Poet was Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex.

Sobran suggests that the so-called procreation sonnets were part of a campaign by Burghley to persuade Southampton to marry his granddaughter, Oxford&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth de Vere, and says that it was more likely that Oxford would have participated in such a campaign than that Shakespeare would know the parties involved or presume to give advice to the nobility.

Oxfordians also assert that the tone of the poems is that of a nobleman addressing an equal rather than that of a poet addressing his patron. According to them, Sonnet 91 (which compares the Fair Youth&#x27;s love to such treasures as high birth, wealth, and horses) implies that the author is in a position to make such comparisons, and the &#x27;high birth&#x27; he refers to is his own.

===Age and lameness===
Oxford was born in 1550, and was between 40 and 53 years old when he presumably would have written the sonnets. Shakespeare was born in 1564. Even though the average life expectancy of Elizabethans was short, being between 26 and 39 was not considered old. In spite of this, age and growing older are recurring themes in the Sonnets, for example, in Sonnets 138 and 37. In his later years, Oxford described himself as &quot;lame&quot;. On several occasions, the author of the sonnets also described himself as lame, such as in Sonnets 37 and 89.

===Public disgrace===
Sobran also believes &quot;scholars have largely ignored one of the chief themes of the Sonnets: the poet&#x27;s sense of disgrace ... [T]here can be no doubt that the poet is referring to something real that he expects his friends to know about; in fact, he makes clear that a wide public knows about it ... Once again the poet&#x27;s situation matches Oxford&#x27;s ... He has been a topic of scandal on several occasions. And his contemporaries saw the course of his life as one of decline from great wealth, honor, and promise to disgrace and ruin. This perception was underlined by enemies who accused him of every imaginable offense and perversion, charges he was apparently unable to rebut.&quot; Examples include Sonnets 29 and 112.

As early as 1576, Edward de Vere was writing about this subject in his poem &quot;Loss of Good Name&quot;, which Steven W. May described as &quot;a defiant lyric without precedent in English Renaissance verse.&quot;

===Lost fame===
The poems &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and &quot;Lucrece&quot;, first published in 1593 and 1594 under the name &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;, proved highly popular for several decades – with &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; published six more times before 1616, while &quot;Lucrece&quot; required four additional printings during this same period. By 1598, they were so famous, London poet and sonneteer Richard Barnefield wrote:

&lt;poem&gt;Shakespeare...
Whose &quot;Venus&quot; and whose &quot;Lucrece&quot; (sweet and chaste)
Thy name in fame&#x27;s immortal Book have plac&#x27;t
Live ever you, at least in Fame live ever:
Well may the Body die, but Fame dies never.&lt;/poem&gt;

Despite such publicity, Sobran observed, &quot;[t]he author of the Sonnets expects and hopes to be forgotten. While he is confident that his poetry will outlast marble and monument, it will immortalize his young friend, not himself. He says that his style is so distinctive and unchanging that &#x27;every word doth almost tell my name,&#x27; implying that his name is otherwise concealed – at a time when he is publishing long poems under the name William Shakespeare. This seems to mean that he is not writing these Sonnets under that (hidden) name.&quot; Oxfordians have interpreted the phrase &quot;every word&quot; as a pun on the word &quot;every&quot;, standing for &quot;e vere&quot; – thus telling his name. Mainstream writers respond that several sonnets literally do tell his name, containing numerous puns on the name Will[iam]; in sonnet 136 the poet directly says &quot;thou lov&#x27;st me for my name is Will.&quot;

Based on Sonnets 81, 72, and others, Oxfordians assert that if the author expected his &quot;name&quot; to be &quot;forgotten&quot; and &quot;buried&quot;, it would not have been the name that permanently adorned the published works themselves.

<text>An oxymoron (plurals: oxymorons and oxymora) is a figure of speech that juxtaposes concepts with opposite meanings within a word or in a phrase that is a self-contradiction. As a rhetorical device, an oxymoron illustrates a point to communicate and reveal a paradox. A general meaning of &quot;contradiction in terms&quot; is recorded by the 1902 edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary.

The term &quot;oxymoron&quot; is first recorded as Latinized Greek &#x27;, in [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] (c. AD 400); it is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word&#x27; &quot;sharp, keen, pointed&quot; and &quot;dull, stupid, foolish&quot;; as it were, &quot;sharp-dull&quot;, &quot;keenly stupid&quot;, or &quot;pointedly foolish&quot;. The word &quot;oxymoron&quot; is autological, i.e., it is itself an example of an oxymoron. The Greek compound word &quot;&quot;, which would correspond to the Latin formation, does not appear in any Ancient Greek works prior to the formation of the Latin term.

==Types and examples==
Oxymorons in the narrow sense are a rhetorical device used deliberately by the speaker and intended to be understood as such by the listener. In a more extended sense, the term &quot;oxymoron&quot; has also been applied to inadvertent or incidental contradictions, as in the case of &quot;dead metaphors&quot; (&quot;barely clothed&quot; or &quot;terribly good&quot;). Lederer (1990), in the spirit of &quot;recreational linguistics&quot;, goes as far as to construct &quot;logological oxymorons&quot; such as reading the word &quot;nook&quot; composed of &quot;no&quot; and &quot;ok&quot; or the surname &quot;Noyes&quot; as composed of &quot;no&quot; plus &quot;yes&quot;, or refers to some oxymoronic candidates as puns through the conversion of nouns into verbs, as in &quot;divorce court&quot;, or &quot;press release&quot;. He refers to potential oxymora such as &quot;war games&quot;, &quot;peacekeeping missile&quot;, &quot;United Nations&quot;, and &quot;airline food&quot; as opinion-based, because some may disagree that they contain an internal contradiction.

There are a number of single-word oxymorons built from &quot;dependent morphemes&quot; (i.e. no longer a productive compound in English, but loaned as a compound from a different language), as with &quot;&quot; (lit. &quot;with the hinder part before&quot;, compare &quot;hysteron proteron&quot;, &quot;upside-down&quot;, &quot;head over heels&quot;, &quot;&quot; etc.) or &quot;sopho-more&quot; (an artificial Greek compound, lit. &quot;wise-foolish&quot;).

The most common form of oxymoron involves an adjective–noun combination of two words, but they can also be devised in the meaning of sentences or phrases. One classic example of the use of oxymorons in English literature can be found in this example from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, where Romeo strings together thirteen in a row:
Other examples from English-language literature include: &quot;hateful good&quot; (Chaucer, translating &quot;odibile bonum&quot;) &quot;proud humility&quot; (Spenser), &quot;darkness visible&quot; (Milton), &quot;beggarly riches&quot; (John Donne), &quot;&quot; (Pope), &quot;expressive silence&quot; (Thomson, echoing Cicero&#x27;s ), 
&quot;melancholy merriment&quot; (Byron), &quot;faith unfaithful&quot;, &quot;falsely true&quot; (Tennyson), &quot;conventionally unconventional&quot;, &quot;tortuous spontaneity&quot; (Henry James) &quot;delighted sorrow&quot;, &quot;loyal treachery&quot;, and &quot;scalding coolness&quot; (Hemingway).

In literary contexts, the author does not usually signal the use of an oxymoron, but in rhetorical usage, it has become common practice to advertise the use of an oxymoron explicitly to clarify the argument, as in:
:&quot;Voltaire [...] we might call, by an oxymoron which has plenty of truth in it, an &#x27;Epicurean pessimist.&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Quarterly Review&quot; vol. 170 (1890), p. 289)
In this example, &quot;Epicurean pessimist&quot; would be recognized as an oxymoron in any case, as the core tenet of Epicureanism is equanimity (which would preclude any sort of pessimist outlook). However, the explicit advertisement of the use of oxymorons opened up a sliding scale of less than obvious construction, ending in the &quot;opinion oxymorons&quot; such as &quot;business ethics&quot;.

J. R. R. Tolkien interpreted his own surname as derived from the Low German equivalent of &quot;dull-keen&quot; (High German &quot;&quot;) which would be a literal equivalent of Greek &quot;oxy-moron&quot;.

==&quot;Comical oxymoron&quot;==
&quot;Comical oxymoron&quot; is a humorous claim that something is an oxymoron. This is called an &quot;opinion oxymoron&quot; by Lederer (1990). The humor derives from implying that an assumption (which might otherwise be expected to be controversial or at least non-evident) is so obvious as to be part of the lexicon. An example of such a &quot;comical oxymoron&quot; is &quot;educational television&quot;: the humor derives entirely from the claim that it is an oxymoron by the implication that &quot;television&quot; is so trivial as to be inherently incompatible with &quot;education&quot;. In a 2009 article called &quot;Daredevil&quot;, Garry Wills accused William F. Buckley of popularizing this trend, based on the success of the latter&#x27;s claim that &quot;an intelligent liberal is an oxymoron&quot;.

Examples popularized by comedian George Carlin in 1975 include &quot;military intelligence&quot; (a play on the lexical meanings of the term &quot;intelligence&quot;, implying that &quot;military&quot; inherently excludes the presence of &quot;intelligence&quot;) and &quot;business ethics&quot; (similarly implying that the mutual exclusion of the two terms is evident or commonly understood rather than the partisan anti-corporate position).

Similarly, the term &quot;civil war&quot; is sometimes jokingly referred to as an &quot;oxymoron&quot; (punning on the lexical meanings of the word &quot;civil&quot;).

Other examples include &quot;honest politician&quot;, &quot;affordable caviar&quot; (1993), &quot;happily married&quot; and &quot;Microsoft Works&quot; (2000).

== Antonym pairs ==

Listing of antonyms, such as &quot;good and evil&quot;, &quot;great and small&quot;, etc., does not create oxymorons, as it is not implied that any given object has the two opposing properties simultaneously. In some languages, it is not necessary to place a conjunction like &quot;and&quot; between the two antonyms; such compounds (not necessarily of antonyms) are known as dvandvas (a term taken from Sanskrit grammar). For example, in Chinese, compounds like 男女 (man and woman, male and female, gender), 陰陽 (yin and yang), 善惡 (good and evil, morality) are used to indicate couples, ranges, or the trait that these are extremes of. The Italian &quot;pianoforte&quot; or &quot;fortepiano&quot; is an example from a Western language; the term is short for &quot;gravicembalo col piano e forte&quot;, as it were &quot;harpsichord with a range of different volumes&quot;, implying that it is possible to play both soft and loud (as well as intermediate) notes, not that the sound produced is somehow simultaneously &quot;soft and loud&quot;.

<text>The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was an intelligence agency of the United States during World War II. The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning.

The OSS was dissolved a month after the end of the war. Intelligence tasks were shortly later resumed and carried over by its successors, the Strategic Services Unit (SSU), the Department of State&#x27;s Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR), and the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), the intermediary precursor to the independent Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

On December 14, 2016, the organization was collectively honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.

== Origin ==

Prior to the formation of the OSS, the various departments of the executive branch, including the State, Treasury, Navy, and War Departments, conducted American intelligence activities on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis, with no overall direction, coordination, or control. The US Army and US Navy had separate code-breaking departments: Signal Intelligence Service and OP-20-G. (A previous code-breaking operation of the State Department, the MI-8, run by Herbert Yardley, had been shut down in 1929 by Secretary of State Henry Stimson, deeming it an inappropriate function for the diplomatic arm, because &quot;gentlemen don&#x27;t read each other&#x27;s mail.&quot;) The FBI was responsible for domestic security and anti-espionage operations.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt was concerned about American intelligence deficiencies. On the suggestion of William Stephenson, the senior British intelligence officer in the western hemisphere, Roosevelt requested that William J. Donovan draft a plan for an intelligence service based on the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and Special Operations Executive (SOE). Donovan envisioned a single agency responsible for foreign intelligence and special operations involving commandos, disinformation, partisan and guerrilla activities. Donovan worked closely with Australian-born British intelligence officer Charles Howard &#x27;Dick&#x27; Ellis, who has been credited with writing the blueprint.

Said Ellis:

I was soon requested to draft a blueprint for an American intelligence agency, the equivalent of BSC [British Security Co-ordination] and based on these British wartime improvisations... detailed tables of organisation were disclosed to Washington... among these were the organisational tables that led to the birth of General William Donovan&#x27;s OSS.

After submitting his (and Ellis&#x27;s) work, &quot;Memorandum of Establishment of Service of Strategic Information&quot;, Donovan was appointed &quot;Coordinator of Information&quot; on July 11, 1941, heading the new organization known as the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI).

Ellis, described as Donovan&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man&quot;, &quot;effectively ran the organization&quot;.

Writes Fink:

Ellis was sent from New York by William Stephenson &quot;to Washington to open a sub-station to facilitate daily liaison with Donovan, who reciprocated by sending [future Director of Central Intelligence, DCI] Allen Welsh Dulles to liaise with BSC in the Rockefeller Center&quot;. According to Thomas F. Troy, paraphrasing Stephenson, Ellis &#x27;was the tradecraft expert, the organization man, the one who furnished Bill Donovan with charts and memoranda on running an intelligence organization&quot;.

Donovan had responsibilities but no actual powers and the existing US agencies were skeptical if not hostile to the British. Until some months after Pearl Harbor, the bulk of OSS intelligence came from the UK. British Security Co-ordination (BSC), under the direction of Ellis, trained the first OSS agents in Canada, until training stations were set up in the US with guidance from BSC instructors, who also provided information on how the SOE was arranged and managed. The British immediately made available their short-wave broadcasting capabilities to Europe, Africa, and the Far East and provided equipment for agents until American production was established.

Writes Fink:

William Casey, who headed up OSS&#x27;s Europe-based human-intelligence operations, the Secret Intelligence Branch, and went on to become director of the CIA, wrote in his autobiography, &quot;The Secret War Against Hitler&quot;, that Ellis was not only writing blueprints but involved in on-the-ground, logistical programs: &quot;Dick Ellis, [an] experienced British pro, helped establish training centres, mostly around Washington.&quot; United States Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle commented: &quot;The really active head of the intelligence section in [William] Donovan&#x27;s [OSS] group is [Ellis] ... in other words, [Stephenson&#x27;s] assistant in the British intelligence [sic] is running Donovan&#x27;s intelligence service.&quot;

The Office of Strategic Services was established by a Presidential military order issued by President Roosevelt on June 13, 1942, to collect and analyze strategic information required by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and to conduct special operations not assigned to other agencies. During the war, the OSS supplied policymakers with facts and estimates, but the OSS never had jurisdiction over all foreign intelligence activities. The FBI was left responsible for intelligence work in Latin America, and the Army and Navy continued to develop and rely on their own sources of intelligence.

== Activities ==

OSS proved especially useful in providing a worldwide overview of the German war effort, its strengths and weaknesses. In direct operations it was successful in supporting Operation Torch in French North Africa in 1942, where it identified pro-Allied potential supporters and located landing sites. OSS operations in neutral countries, especially Stockholm, Sweden, provided in-depth information on German advanced technology. The Madrid station set up agent networks in France that supported the Allied invasion of southern France in 1944. Most famous were the operations in Switzerland run by Allen Dulles that provided extensive information on German strength, air defenses, submarine production, and the V-1 and V-2 weapons. It revealed some of the secret German efforts in chemical and biological warfare. Switzerland&#x27;s station also supported resistance fighters in France, Austria and Italy, and helped with the surrender of German forces in Italy in 1945.

For the duration of World War II, the Office of Strategic Services was conducting multiple activities and missions, including collecting intelligence by spying, performing acts of sabotage, waging propaganda war, organizing and coordinating anti-Nazi resistance groups in Europe, and providing military training for anti-Japanese guerrilla movements in Asia, among other things. At the height of its influence during World War II, the OSS employed almost 24,000 people.

From 1943 to 1945, the OSS played a major role in training Kuomintang troops in China and Burma, and recruited Kachin and other indigenous irregular forces for sabotage as well as guides for Allied forces in Burma fighting the Japanese Army. Among other activities, the OSS helped arm, train, and supply resistance movements in areas occupied by the Axis powers during World War II, including Mao Zedong&#x27;s Red Army in China (known as the Dixie Mission) and the Viet Minh in French Indochina. OSS officer Archimedes Patti played a central role in OSS operations in French Indochina and met frequently with Ho Chi Minh in 1945.

One of the greatest accomplishments of the OSS during World War II was its penetration of Nazi Germany by OSS operatives. The OSS was responsible for training German and Austrian individuals for missions inside Germany. Some of these agents included exiled communists and Socialist party members, labor activists, anti-Nazi prisoners-of-war, and German and Jewish refugees. The OSS also recruited and ran one of the war&#x27;s most important spies, the German diplomat Fritz Kolbe.

From 1943 the OSS was in contact with the Austrian resistance group around Kaplan Heinrich Maier. As a result, plans and production facilities for V-2 rockets, Tiger tanks and aircraft (Messerschmitt Bf 109, Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet, etc.) were passed on to Allied general staffs in order to enable Allied bombers to get accurate air strikes. The Maier group informed very early about the mass murder of Jews through its contacts with the Semperit factory near Auschwitz. The group was gradually dismantled by the German authorities because of a double agent who worked for both the OSS and the Gestapo. This uncovered a transfer of money from the Americans to Vienna via Istanbul and Budapest, and most of the members were executed after a People&#x27;s Court hearing.

In 1943, the Office of Strategic Services set up operations in Istanbul. Turkey, as a neutral country during the Second World War, was a place where both the Axis and Allied powers had spy networks. The railroads connecting central Asia with Europe, as well as Turkey&#x27;s close proximity to the Balkan states, placed it at a crossroads of intelligence gathering. The goal of the OSS Istanbul operation called Project Net-1 was to infiltrate and extenuate subversive action in the old Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires.

The head of operations at OSS Istanbul was a banker from Chicago named Lanning &quot;Packy&quot; Macfarland, who maintained a cover story as a banker for the American lend-lease program. Macfarland hired Alfred Schwarz, an Austrian businessman (* 25. April 1904 in Prostějov, Austria-Hungary; † 13. August 1988 in Lucerne, Switzerland) who came to be known as &quot;Dogwood&quot; and ended up establishing the Dogwood information chain. Dogwood in turn hired a personal assistant named Walter Arndt and established himself as an employee of the Istanbul Western Electrik Kompani. Through Schwarz and Arndt the OSS was able to infiltrate anti-fascist groups in Austria, Hungary, and Germany. Schwarz was able to convince Romanian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, and Swiss diplomatic couriers to smuggle American intelligence information into these territories and establish contact with elements antagonistic to the Nazis and their collaborators. Couriers and agents memorized information and produced analytical reports; when they were not able to memorize effectively they recorded information on microfilm and hid it in their shoes or hollowed pencils. Through this process information about the Nazi regime made its way to Macfarland and the OSS in Istanbul and eventually to Washington.

While the OSS &quot;Dogwood-chain&quot; produced a lot of information, its reliability was increasingly questioned by British intelligence. By May 1944, through collaboration between the OSS, British intelligence, Cairo, and Washington, the entire Dogwood-chain was found to be unreliable and dangerous. Planting phony information into the OSS was intended to misdirect the resources of the Allies. Schwarz&#x27;s Dogwood-chain, which was the largest American intelligence gathering tool in occupied territory, was shortly thereafter shut down.

The OSS purchased Soviet code and cipher material (or Finnish information on them) from émigré Finnish army officers in late 1944. Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, Jr., protested that this violated an agreement President Roosevelt made with the Soviet Union not to interfere with Soviet cipher traffic from the United States. General Donovan might have copied the papers before returning them the following January, but there is no record of Arlington Hall receiving them, and CIA and NSA archives have no surviving copies. This codebook was in fact used as part of the Venona decryption effort, which helped uncover large-scale Soviet espionage in North America.

RYPE was the codename of the airborne unit who was dropped in the Norwegian mountains of Snåsa on March 24, 1945 to carry out sabotage actions behind enemy lines. From the base at the Gjefsjøen mountain farm, the group conducted successful railroad sabotages, with the intention of preventing the withdrawal of German forces from northern Norway. Operasjon Rype was the only U.S. operation on German-occupied Norwegian soil during WW2. The group consisted mainly of Norwegian Americans recruited from the 99th Infantry Battalion. Operasjon Rype was led by William Colby.

The OSS sent four teams of two under Captain Stephen Vinciguerra (codename &quot;Algonquin&quot;, teams Alsace, Poissy, S&amp;S and Student), with Operation Varsity in March 1945 to infiltrate and report from behind enemy lines, but none succeeded. Team S&amp;S had two agents in Wehrmacht uniforms and a captured Kϋbelwagon; to report by radio. But the Kϋbelwagon was put out of action while in the glider; three tires and the long-range radio were shot up (German gunners were told to attack the gliders not the tow planes).

== Weapons and gadgets ==
The OSS espionage and sabotage operations produced a steady demand for highly specialized equipment. General Donovan invited experts, organized workshops, and funded labs that later formed the core of the Research &amp; Development Branch. Boston chemist Stanley P. Lovell became its first head, and Donovan humorously called him his &quot;Professor Moriarty&quot;. Throughout the war years, the OSS Research &amp; Development successfully adapted Allied weapons and espionage equipment, and produced its own line of novel spy tools and gadgets, including silenced pistols, lightweight sub-machine guns, &quot;Beano&quot; grenades that exploded upon impact, explosives disguised as lumps of coal (&quot;Black Joe&quot;) or bags of Chinese flour (&quot;Aunt Jemima&quot;), acetone time delay fuses for limpet mines, compasses hidden in uniform buttons, playing cards that concealed maps, a 16mm Kodak camera in the shape of a matchbox, tasteless poison tablets (&quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; pills), and cigarettes laced with tetrahydrocannabinol acetate (an extract of Indian hemp) to induce uncontrollable chattiness.

The OSS also developed innovative communication equipment such as wiretap gadgets, electronic beacons for locating agents, and the &quot;Joan-Eleanor&quot; portable radio system that made it possible for operatives on the ground to establish secure contact with a plane that was preparing to land or drop cargo. The OSS Research &amp; Development also printed fake German and Japanese-issued identification cards, and various passes, ration cards, and counterfeit money.

On August 28, 1943, Stanley Lovell was asked to make a presentation in front of a hostile Joint Chiefs of Staff, who were skeptical of OSS plans beyond collecting military intelligence and were ready to split the OSS between the Army and the Navy. While explaining the purpose and mission of his department and introducing various gadgets and tools, he reportedly casually dropped into a waste basket a Hedy, a panic-inducing explosive device in the shape of a firecracker, which shortly produced a loud shrieking sound followed by a deafening boom. The presentation was interrupted and did not resume since everyone in the room fled. In reality, the Hedy, jokingly named after Hollywood movie star Hedy Lamarr for her ability to distract men, later saved the lives of some trapped OSS operatives.

Not all projects worked. Some ideas were odd, such as a failed attempt to use insects to spread anthrax in Spain. Stanley Lovell was later quoted saying, &quot;It was my policy to consider any method whatever that might aid the war, however unorthodox or untried&quot;.

In 1939, a young physician named Christian J. Lambertsen developed an oxygen rebreather set (the Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit) and demonstrated it to the OSS—after already being rejected by the U.S. Navy—in a pool at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington D.C., in 1942. The OSS not only bought into the concept, they hired Lambertsen to lead the program and build up the dive element for the organization. His responsibilities included training and developing methods of combining self-contained diving and swimmer delivery including the Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit for the OSS &quot;Operational Swimmer Group&quot;. Growing involvement of the OSS with coastal infiltration and water-based sabotage eventually led to creation of the OSS Maritime Unit.

== Headquarters and field offices ==

The bulk of the OSS, after the expansion out of and away from COI, eventually found itself headquartered at a complex near 23rd Street and E Street in Washington, D.C. This complex was unassuming, appearing to be a mix of normal government offices and apartment buildings to nearby residents and office workers. It is known as the &quot;Navy Hill Complex,&quot; &quot;Potomac Hill Complex,&quot; and the &quot;E Street Complex.&quot; The OSS Society and State Department have engaged in efforts with the National Park Service to add the Headquarters complex to the National Register of Historic Places.

==Training facilities==
At Camp X, near Whitby, Ontario, an &quot;assassination and elimination&quot; training program was operated by the British Special Operations Executive, assigning exceptional masters in the art of knife-wielding combat, such as William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes, to instruct trainees. Many members of the Office of Strategic Services also were trained there. It was dubbed &quot;the school of mayhem and murder&quot; by George Hunter White who trained at the facility in the 1940&#x27;s.

Beginning in January 1941, Colonel Millard Preston Goodfellow, creator and Director of the Special Operations Branch (at this time still known as SA/G within the COI), negotiated with the National Park Service to obtain three tracts of land to be dedicated as training camps for both SA/G and SA/B. In March, he assigned Garland H. Williams to be the Training Director of these facilities.

Commander N.G.A Woolley was loaned to COI by the British Navy and helped Donovan and Goodfellow to organize underwater training and craft landing.

From these incipient beginnings, the Office of Strategic Services opened camps in the United States, and finally abroad. Prince William Forest Park (then known as Chopawamsic Recreational Demonstration Area) was the site of an OSS training camp that operated from 1942 to 1945. Area &quot;C&quot;, consisting of approximately , was used extensively for communications training, whereas Area &quot;A&quot; was used for training some of the OGs (Operational Groups). Catoctin Mountain Park, now the location of Camp David, was the site of OSS training Area &quot;B&quot; where the first Special Operations, or SO, were trained. Special Operations was modeled after Great Britain&#x27;s Special Operations Executive, which included parachute, sabotage, self-defense, weapons, and leadership training to support guerrilla or partisan resistance. Considered most mysterious of all was the &quot;cloak and dagger&quot; Secret Intelligence, or SI branch. Secret Intelligence employed &quot;country estates as schools for introducing recruits into the murky world of espionage. Thus, it established Training Areas E and RTU-11 (&quot;the Farm&quot;) in spacious manor houses with surrounding horse farms.&quot; Morale Operations training included psychological warfare and propaganda. The Congressional Country Club (Area F) in Bethesda, Maryland, was the primary OSS training facility. The Facilities of the Catalina Island Marine Institute at Toyon Bay on Santa Catalina Island, Calif., are composed (in part) of a former OSS survival training camp. The National Park Service commissioned a study of OSS National Park training facilities by Professor John Chambers of Rutgers University.

The main OSS training camps abroad were located initially in Great Britain, French Algeria, and Egypt; later as the Allies advanced, a school was established in southern Italy. In the Far East, OSS training facilities were established in India, Ceylon, and then China. The London branch of the OSS, its first overseas facility, was at 70 Grosvenor Street, W1. In addition to training local agents, the overseas OSS schools also provided advanced training and field exercises for graduates of the training camps in the United States and for Americans who enlisted in the OSS in the war zones. The most famous of the latter was Virginia Hall in France.

The OSS&#x27;s Mediterranean training center in Cairo, Egypt, known to many as the &quot;Spy School&quot;, was a lavish palace belonging to King Farouk&#x27;s brother-in-law, called &quot;Ras el Kanayas&quot;. It was modeled after the SOE&#x27;s training facility STS 102 in Haifa, Palestine. Americans whose heritage stemmed from Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece were trained at the &quot;Spy School&quot; and also sent for parachute, weapons, and commando training, and Morse code and encryption lessons at STS 102. After completion of their spy training, these agents were sent back on missions to the Balkans and Italy where their accents would not pose a problem for their assimilation.

==Personnel==
The names of all 13,000 OSS personnel and documents of their OSS service, previously a closely guarded secret, were released by the US National Archives on August 14, 2008. Among the 24,000 names were those of Sterling Hayden, Milton Wolff, Carl C. Cable, Julia Child, Ralph Bunche, Arthur Goldberg, Saul K. Padover, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Bruce Sundlun, William Colby, René Joyeuse, and John Ford. The 750,000 pages in the 35,000 personnel files include applications of people who were not recruited or hired, as well as the service records of those who served.

OSS soldiers were primarily inducted from the United States Armed Forces. Other members included foreign nationals including displaced individuals from the former czarist Russia, an example being Prince Serge Obolensky.

Donovan sought independent thinkers, and in order to bring together those many intelligent, quick-witted individuals who could think out-of-the box, he chose them from all walks of life, backgrounds, without distinction to culture or religion. Donovan was quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;d rather have a young lieutenant with enough guts to disobey a direct order than a colonel too regimented to think for himself.&quot; In a matter of a few short months, he formed an organization which equalled and then rivalled Great Britain&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service and its Special Operations Executive. Donovan, inspired by Britain&#x27;s SOE, assembled an outstanding group of clinical psychologists to carry out evaluations of potential OSS candidates at a variety of sites, primary among these was Station S in Northern Virginia near where Dulles International Airport now stands. Recent research from remaining records from the OSS Station S program describes how those characteristics (independent thought, effective intelligence, interpersonal skills) were found among OSS candidates 
 One such agent was Ivy League polyglot and Jewish American baseball catcher Moe Berg, who played 15 seasons in the major leagues. As a Secret Intelligence agent, he was dispatched to seek information on German physicist Werner Heisenberg and his knowledge on the atomic bomb. One of the most highly decorated and flamboyant OSS soldiers was US Marine Colonel Peter Ortiz. Enlisting early in the war, as a French Foreign Legionnaire, he went on to join the OSS and to be the most highly decorated US Marine in the OSS during World War II. Julia Child, who later authored cookbooks, worked directly under Donovan.
René Joyeuse M.D., MS, FACS was a Swiss, French and American soldier, physician and researcher, who distinguished himself as an agent of Allied intelligence in German-occupied France during World War II. He received the US Army Distinguished Service Cross for his actions with the OSS, after the war he became a Physician, Researcher and was a co-founder of The American Trauma Society.

&quot;Jumping Joe&quot; Savoldi (code name Sampson) was recruited by the OSS in 1942 because of his hand-to-hand combat and language skills as well as his deep knowledge of the Italian geography and Benito Mussolini&#x27;s compound. He was assigned to the Special Operations Branch and took part in missions in North Africa, Italy, and France during 1943–1945. 
 One of the forefathers of today&#x27;s commandos was Navy Lieutenant Jack Taylor. He was sequestered by the OSS early in the war and had a long career behind enemy lines.

Taro and Mitsu Yashima, both Japanese political dissidents who were imprisoned in Japan for protesting its militarist regime, worked for the OSS in psychological warfare against the Japanese Empire.

Nisei linguists

In late 1943, a representative from OSS visited the 442nd Infantry Regiment looking to recruit volunteers willing to undertake &quot;extremely hazardous assignment.&quot; All selected were Nisei. The recruits were assigned to OSS Detachments 101 and 202, in the China-Burma-India Theater. &quot;Once deployed, they were to interrogate prisoners, translate documents, monitor radio communications, and conduct covert operations... Detachment 101 and 102&#x27;s clandestine operations were extremely successful.&quot;

==Dissolution into other agencies==
On September 20, 1945, President Truman signed Executive Order 9621, terminating the OSS. Due to administrative error, the order only allowed the agency ten days to close. The State Department took over the Research and Analysis Branch (R&amp;A); it became the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, The War Department took over the Secret Intelligence (SI) and Counter-Espionage (X-2) Branches, which were then housed in the new Strategic Services Unit (SSU). Brigadier General John Magruder (formerly Donovan&#x27;s Deputy Director for Intelligence in OSS) became the new SSU director. He oversaw the liquidation of the OSS and managed the institutional preservation of its clandestine intelligence capability.

In January 1946, President Truman created the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), which was the direct precursor to the CIA. SSU assets, which now constituted a streamlined &quot;nucleus&quot; of clandestine intelligence, were transferred to the CIG in mid-1946 and reconstituted as the Office of Special Operations (OSO). The National Security Act of 1947 established the Central Intelligence Agency, which then took up some OSS functions. The direct descendant of the paramilitary component of the OSS is the CIA Special Activities Division.

Today, the joint-branch United States Special Operations Command, founded in 1987, uses the same spearhead design on its insignia, as homage to its indirect lineage. The Defense Intelligence Agency currently manages the OSS&#x27; mandate to provide strategic military intelligence to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense and to coordinate human espionage activities across the United States Armed Forces (through the Defense Clandestine Service) and was awarded status as an OSS Heritage organization by the OSS Society.

<doc id="22680" wikidata="Q171411" url="?curid=22680" title="Oda Nobunaga">
<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; and one of the leading figures of the Sengoku and Azuchi-Momoyama periods. He was the and regarded as the first &quot;Great Unifier&quot; of Japan. He is sometimes referred as the &quot;Demon Daimyō&quot; and &quot;Demon King of the Sixth Heaven&quot;.

Nobunaga was an influential figure in Japanese history and is regarded as one of the three great unifiers of Japan, along with his retainers, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Nobunaga paved the foundations for the successful reigns of Hideyoshi and Ieyasu. The period when Nobunaga and Hideyoshi were in power is called the Azuchi–Momoyama period. The name &quot;Azuchi–Momoyama&quot; comes from the fact that Nobunaga&#x27;s castle, Azuchi Castle, was located in Azuchi, Shiga; while Fushimi Castle, where Hideyoshi lived after his retirement, was located in Momoyama.

Nobunaga was head of the very powerful Oda clan and launched a war against other &quot;daimyō&quot; to unify Japan in the 1560s. Nobunaga emerged as the most powerful &quot;daimyō&quot;, overthrowing the nominally ruling shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki and dissolving the Ashikaga Shogunate in 1573. He conquered most of Honshu by 1580, and defeated the Ikkō-ikki in the 1580s. Nobunaga&#x27;s rule was noted for innovative military tactics, fostering of free trade, reforms of Japan&#x27;s civil government, and the start of the Momoyama historical art period, but also for the brutal suppression of those who refused to cooperate or yield to his demands. Nobunaga committed during the Honnō-ji Incident in 1582, when his retainer Akechi Mitsuhide ambushed and trapped him in a temple in Kyoto. Nobunaga was succeeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who along with Tokugawa Ieyasu completed his war of unification shortly afterward.

==Early life (1534–1551)==

Oda Nobunaga was born on 23 June 1534 in Nagoya, Owari Province, and was the heir of Oda Nobuhide, the head of the powerful Oda clan and a deputy (military governor), and his lawful wife Dota Gozen.
Nobunaga was previously considered to have been born in Nagoya Castle, but in recent years the theory that he was born in Shobata Castle has become more promising.
Nobunaga was given the childhood name of , and through his childhood and early teenage years became well known for his bizarre behavior.
Nobunaga was given Nagoya Castle by his father at the age of 8 and lived there for 13 years until he took Kiyosu Castle at the age of 21. He had one or two older brothers, but they were illegitimate sons. As the first legitimate son, Nobunaga was intended to succeed Nobuhide as leader of the Oda clan, and so he was separated from his mother and given special education. Four karō (chief retainers), Hayashi Hidesada, Hirate Masahide, Aoyama Nobumasa, and Naitō Shōsuke (or Katsusuke), were assigned to train and educate him for his future role.

Nobunaga came to manhood and took the name Oda Saburō Nobunaga in 1546. He then led the forces of the Oda clan against rival Kira and Ohama in Mikawa for his first campaign in 1547.

In 1548 or 1549, Nobuhide made peace with Saitō Dōsan, lord of Mino Province (which had previously been hostile to Owari) through a political marriage between his son Nobunaga and Dōsan&#x27;s daughter, Nōhime. Nobunaga took Nōhime as his lawful wife, and Dōsan became Nobunaga&#x27;s father-in-law.
Nobunaga also became involved in government affairs at this time, gaining valuable political experience and insight.

==Unification of Owari (1551–1560)==
===Succession crisis===

In 1551, Oda Nobuhide died unexpectedly. It has been said that Nobunaga acted outrageously during his funeral, throwing ceremonial incense at the altar. Although Nobunaga was Nobuhide&#x27;s legitimate heir, a succession crisis occurred when some of the Oda clan opposed him. Nobunaga assembled a force of 1,000 men and used them to intimidate and dissuade his enemies, thus preventing a serious disruption in the transfer of power.

Sensing weakness, the &quot;daimyō&quot; Imagawa Yoshimoto sent an army under the command of Imagawa Sessai to lay siege to the castle at Anjō, where Oda Nobuhiro, Nobunaga&#x27;s older brother, was living. To save his life, Nobunaga was compelled to turn over a hostage held by his clan at Honshōji temple, nine-year-old Matsudaira Takechiyo – later known as Tokugawa Ieyasu – an exchange that helped solidify an alliance between other rival clans. Nobuhiro, frustrated by his low standing in the Oda clan, later plotted against Nobunaga with the assistance of another rival, Saitō Yoshitatsu; Nobunaga learned of the plot but chose to forgive his brother&#x27;s problem.

In early 1552, barely several months after his father&#x27;s death, one of Oda&#x27;s senior retainers, and his son defected to the Imagawa clan. In response, Nobunaga attacked Noritsugu, but was defeated by Noriyoshi&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Akatsuka; he retreated and left contested lands in eastern Owari under Imagawa control.

===Consolidation of clan leadership===
In spring 1552, Nobunaga faced a new challenge when his uncle, Oda Nobutomo, attacked Nobunaga domain with the support of Shiba Yoshimune, governor of Owari province. Nobunaga repelled the attack and burned the outskirts of his uncle&#x27;s castle at Kiyosu to discourage further attempts. However, Nobutomo was spared any serious punishment.

In 1553, Hirate Masahide, who had been one of Nobunaga&#x27;s closest advisors and mentors, committed &quot;seppuku&quot;. It is generally believed that he did so to admonish Nobunaga, but the actual motive is unclear. Yoshimune tipped off Nobunaga that Nobutomo planned to assassinate him; he was subsequently captured and put to death on the latter&#x27;s orders. Nobunaga mobilized his forces to blockade Kiyosu castle and set up a lengthy siege.

In 1554, Nobunaga finally achieved victory over the Imagawa clan at the Battle of Muraki Castle, reclaiming the lands he had lost to them. After securing eastern Owari, Nobunaga then turned his attention back to the siege at Kiyosu, where he eventually defeated Nobutomo and forced him to die by &quot;seppuku&quot;.

In 1556, Saitō Yoshitatsu raised an army against his father, Saitō Dōsan, who was slain in combat at the Battle of Nagara-gawa. Nobunaga set out to Oura in Mino with troops to rescue his father-in-law, but immediately withdrew upon hearing of Dōsan&#x27;s death. Thereafter, Yoshitatsu usurped his father&#x27;s title and became lord of Mino.

The loss of the Saitō clan&#x27;s support further undermined faith in Nobunaga&#x27;s leadership; key retainers such as Hayashi Hidesada, Hayashi Michitomo, and Shibata Katsuie soon turned on him. They raised an army to support his brother Nobuyuki (Nobukatsu), who was highly regarded within the Oda clan. Nobunaga defeated the rebels at the Battle of Ino, but at the plea of his birth mother, Dota Gozen, pardoned them. Despite his brother Michitomo&#x27;s death in battle, Hidesada pledged his loyalty to Nobunaga and resumed serving him, while Katsuie chose to remain in Nobuyuki&#x27;s service.

In 1557, however, Nobuyuki conspired with Oda Nobuyasu, lord of Iwakura Castle, to plot another rebellion. Shibata, disgusted by Nobuyuki&#x27;s treachery and disloyalty, secretly warned Nobunaga. Nobunaga falsely claimed to have fallen ill and had Nobuyuki and his entourage assassinated when they came to visit him. It is said that either Kawajiri Hidetaka or Ikeda Tsuneoki carried out Nobuyuki&#x27;s murder.

In 1558, Nobunaga sent an army to successfully protect Suzuki Shigeteru, lord of Terabe Castle, during the Siege of Terabe. Shigeteru had defected to Nobunaga&#x27;s side from Imagawa Yoshimoto, a &quot;daimyō&quot; from Suruga Province and one of the most powerful men in the Tōkaidō region.

By 1559, Nobunaga had captured and destroyed Iwakura Castle, eliminated all opposition within the Oda clan, and established his uncontested rule in Owari Province.

==Rise to power (1560–1568)==
===Conflict with Imagawa===

Imagawa Yoshimoto was a long-time opponent of Nobunaga&#x27;s father, and had sought to expand his domain into Oda territory in Owari. In 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto gathered an army of 25,000 men, and marched toward the capital city of Kyoto, with the pretext of aiding the frail Ashikaga Shogunate. The Matsudaira clan also joined Yoshimoto&#x27;s forces. The Imagawa forces quickly overran the border fortresses of Washizu, and Matsudaira forces led by Matsudaira Motoyasu took Marune Fortress from the Oda clan. Against this, the Oda clan could rally an army of only 2,000 to 3,000 men. Some of his advisors suggested that he take refuge at Kiyosu Castle and wait out a siege by the Imagawa, but Nobunaga refused, stating that &quot;only a strong offensive policy could make up for the superior numbers of the enemy&quot;, and calmly ordered a counterattack against Yoshimoto.

====Battle of Okehazama====

In June 1560, Nobunaga&#x27;s scouts reported that Yoshimoto was resting at the narrow gorge of Dengaku-Kazama, ideal for a surprise attack and that the Imagawa army was celebrating their victories over the Washizu and Marune fortresses. While Yoshimoto viewed victory ahead, Nobunaga&#x27;s forces marched to the Atsuta Shrine, a fortified temple overlooking the Imagawa camp. Later, Nobunaga moved to , set up a decoy army there, marched rapidly behind Yoshimoto&#x27;s camp, and attacked after a terrific thunderstorm. Yoshimoto was killed by two Oda samurai. With his victory in this battle, Oda Nobunaga gained greatly in prestige, and many samurai and warlords pledged fealty to him.

Kinoshita Tōkichirō, who would eventually become Toyotomi Hideyoshi, probably participated in the battle, but nothing is recorded from that time. His exploits were first recorded in the Mino Campaign.

===Alliance with Matsudaira (later Tokugawa) and Takeda===
Rapidly weakening in the wake of this battle, the Imagawa clan no longer exerted control over the Matsudaira clan. In 1561, an alliance was forged between Oda Nobunaga and Matsudaira Motoyasu (who would become Tokugawa Ieyasu), despite the decades-old hostility between the two clans. Nobunaga also formed an alliance with Takeda Shingen through the marriage of his daughter to Shingen&#x27;s son.

===Mino campaign===
In 1561, Saitō Yoshitatsu, Nobunaga&#x27;s brother-in-law, died suddenly of illness and was succeeded by his son, Nobunaga&#x27;s nephew, Saitō Tatsuoki. Yoshitatsu murdered his father and brothers to become daimyō, and Nobunaga had attempted to avenge the murder of his father-in-law numerous times. Nobunaga&#x27;s nephew Tatsuoki was young and much less effective as a ruler and military strategist than his father and grandfather. Taking advantage of this situation, Nobunaga moved his base to Komaki Castle and started his campaign in Mino Province, defeating Tatsuoki in both the Battle of Moribeand the Battle of Jushijo in June that same year.

By convincing Saitō retainers to abandon their incompetent and foolish master, Nobunaga significantly weakened the Saitō clan. In 1564, Oda Nobunaga dispatched his retainer, Kinoshita Tōkichirō, to bribe many of the warlords in the Mino area to support the Oda clan. In 1566, Nobunaga charged Kinoshita with building Sunomata Castle on the bank of the Sai River opposite Saitō territory, to serve as a staging point for the Oda forces, and to intimidate, surprise, and demoralize the enemy.

In 1567, the Mino Triumvirate (西美濃三人衆, Nishi-Mino Sanninshū) was commanded by three samurai generals serving the Saitō clan: Inaba Ittetsu, Andō Michitari, and Ujiie Bokuzen. The triumvirate agreed to change sides and join the forces of Oda Nobunaga. Their combined forces mounted a victorious final attack at the Siege of Inabayama Castle. After taking possession of the castle, Nobunaga changed the name of both Inabayama Castle and the surrounding town to Gifu. Nobunaga derived the term &quot;Gifu&quot; from the legendary Mount Qi (岐山 &quot;Qi&quot; in Standard Chinese) in China, on which the Zhou dynasty is fabled to have started. Nobunaga revealed his ambition to conquer the whole of Japan, and also started using a new personal seal that read Tenka Fubu (天下布武), literally &quot;All under heaven, spreading military force&quot;, or more idiomatically, &quot;All the world by force of arms&quot;. Remains of Nobunaga&#x27;s residence in Gifu can be found today in Gifu Park.

===Ise campaign, Omi campaign, and march to Kyoto===

Following Nobunaga&#x27;s conquest of Mino Province in 1567, Nobunaga sent Takigawa Kazumasu on a campaign comprising two invasions of Ise Province in 1567 and 1568 that defeated numerous families of Ise (Ise was ruled nominally by the Kitabatake clan). Later in 1569, head of Kitabatake clan, Kitabatake Tomonori, adopted Nobunaga&#x27;s second son Oda Nobukatsu.

Nobunaga also in an effort to cement an alliance between Nobunaga and rival warlord Azai Nagamasa from Omi Province, Nobunaga arranged for Oichi, his sister, to marry Nagamasa. Nobunaga desired peaceful relations with the Azai clan because of their strategic position between the Oda clan&#x27;s land and the capital, Kyoto.

In 1568, Ashikaga Yoshiaki and Akechi Mitsuhide, as Yoshiaki&#x27;s bodyguard, went to Gifu to ask Nobunaga to start a campaign toward Kyoto. Yoshiaki was the brother of the murdered 13th shogun of the Ashikaga Shogunate, Yoshiteru, who had been killed by the Miyoshi &quot;tannins&quot; (three chiefs of the Miyoshi clan, Miyoshi Nagayuki, Miyoshi Masayasu and Iwanari Tomomichi). Yoshiaki wanted revenge against the killers who had already set up a puppet shogun, Ashikaga Yoshihide. Nobunaga agreed to install Yoshiaki as the new shogun, and grasping the opportunity to enter Kyoto, started his campaign. An obstacle in southern Ōmi Province was the Rokkaku clan, led by Rokkaku Yoshikata, who refused to recognize Yoshiaki as shogun and was ready to go to war to defend Yoshihide. In response, Nobunaga launched a rapid attack on Chōkō-ji Castle, driving the Rokkaku clan out of their castles. Other forces led by Niwa Nagahide defeated the Rokkaku on the battlefield and entered Kannonji Castle, before resuming Nobunaga&#x27;s march to Kyoto. Later in 1570, the Rokkaku tried to retake the castle, but they were driven back by Oda forces led by Shibata Katsuie. The approaching Oda army influenced the Matsunaga clan to submit to the future shogun. The &quot;daimyō&quot; Matsunaga Hisahide kept his title by making this decision to ally his clan with the shogun.

On 9 November 1568, Nobunaga entered Kyoto, drove out the Miyoshi clan, who had supported the 14th shogun and who fled to Settsu, and installed Yoshiaki as the 15th shogun of the Ashikaga Shogunate. However, Nobunaga refused the title of shogun&#x27;s deputy (Kanrei), or any appointment from Yoshiaki, even though Nobunaga had great respect for the Emperor Ōgimachi.

==Unification of Japan (1568–1582)==
===Conflict with Asakura, Ashikaga and Azai===

After installing Yoshiaki as shogun, Nobunaga forced Yoshiaki to call all &quot;daimyō&quot; to come to Kyoto and attend court banquet. Asakura Yoshikage, head of the Asakura clan and regent of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, refused, which prompted Nobunaga to declare Yoshikage as rebel, Nobunaga raised an army and marched on Echizen. In early 1570, Nobunaga launched a campaign into the Asakura clan&#x27;s domain and besieged Kanagasaki Castle. This action made a conflict between Nobunaga and shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, as their relationship grew difficult, Yoshiaki secretly started an &quot;anti-Nobunaga alliance&quot;, conspiring with other &quot;daimyō&quot; to get rid of Nobunaga. Azai Nagamasa, to whom Nobunaga&#x27;s sister Oichi was married, broke the alliance with the Oda clan to honor the Azai-Asakura alliance, which had lasted for three generations. With the help of the Rokkaku clan, Miyoshi clan, and the Ikkō-ikki, the anti-Nobunaga alliance sprang into full force, taking a heavy toll on the Oda clan. After Nobunaga found himself facing both the Asakura and Azai forces and when defeat looked certain, Nobunaga decided to retreat from Kanagasaki, which he did successfully.

====Battle of Anegawa====

In July 1570, the Oda-Tokugawa allies laid siege to Yokoyama Castle and Odani Castle. Later, the combined Azai-Asakura force marched out to confront Nobunaga. Nobunaga advanced to the southern bank of the Anegawa River. The following morning, on 30 July 1570, the battle between the Oda and the Azai-Asakura forces began. Tokugawa Ieyasu joined his forces with Nobunaga, with the Oda and Azai clashing on the right while Tokugawa and Asakura grappled on the left. The battle turned into a melee fought in the middle of the shallow Anegawa River. For a time, Nobunaga&#x27;s forces fought the Azai upstream, while the Tokugawa warriors fought the Asakura downstream. After the Tokugawa forces finished off the Asakura, they turned and hit the Azai&#x27;s right flank. The troops of the Mino Triumvirate, who had been held in reserve, then came forward and hit the Azai left flank. Soon both the Oda and Tokugawa forces defeated the combined forces of the Asakura and Azai clans.

1573 is the end of Azai and Asakura clans, Nobunaga marched leading 30,000 troops which mainly consisted of the troops of Owari, Mino, and Ise Provinces. He launched the Siege of Ichijōdani Castle and Siege of Odani Castle. Nobunaga successfully destroyed the Azai and Asakura clans by driving them both to the point that the clan leaders committed suicide.

===Ikkō-ikki Campaigns===

Nobunaga faced a significant threat from the Ikkō-ikki, a resistance movement centered around the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism. The Ikkō-ikki began as a cult association for self-defense, but popular antipathy against the samurai from the constant violence of the Sengoku period caused their numbers to swell. By the time of Nobunaga&#x27;s rise to power, the Ikkō-ikki was a major organized armed force opposed to samurai rule in Japan. In August 1570, Nobunaga launched the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War against the Ikkō-ikki, while simultaneously fighting against his samurai rivals. In May 1571, Nobunaga besieged Nagashima, a series of Ikkō-ikki fortifications in Owari Province, beginning the Sieges of Nagashima. However, Nobunaga&#x27;s first siege of Nagashima ended in failure, as his trusted general Shibata Katsuie was severely wounded and many of his samurai were lost before retreating. Despite this defeat, Nobunaga was inspired to launch another siege, the Siege of Mount Hiei.

====Siege of Mount Hiei====

The Enryaku-ji temple on Mount Hiei was an issue for Nobunaga. The monastery&#x27;s (warrior monks) of the Tendai school were aiding his opponents in the Azai-Asakura alliance and the temple was close to his base of power. In September 1571, Nobunaga preemptively attacked the Enryaku-ji temple, then besieged Mount Hiei and razed it. In the process of making their way to the Enryaku-ji temple, Nobunaga&#x27;s forces destroyed and burnt all buildings, killing monks, laymen, women, and children and eliminating anyone who had previously escaped their attack. It is said that &quot;The whole mountainside was a great slaughterhouse and the sight was one of unbearable horror.&quot; 
====Siege of Nagashima====

After the success of the Siege of Mount Hiei. 
In July 1573, Nobunaga besieged Nagashima for a second time, personally leading a sizable force with many arquebusiers. However, a rainstorm rendered his arquebuses inoperable while the Ikkō-ikki&#x27;s own arquebusiers could fire from covered positions. Nobunaga himself was almost killed and forced to retreat, with the second siege being considered his greatest defeat.

In 1574, Nobunaga launched a third siege of Nagashima as his general Kuki Yoshitaka began a naval blockade and bombardment of Nagashima, allowing him to capture the outer forts of Nakae and Yanagashima as well as part of the Nagashima complex. The sieges of Nagashima finally ended when Nobunaga&#x27;s men completely surrounded the complex and set fire to it, killing the remaining tens of thousands of defenders and inflicting tremendous losses to the Ikkō-ikki.

====Ishiyama Hongan-ji War====

Simultaneously, Nobunaga had been besieging the Ikkō-ikki&#x27;s main stronghold at Ishiyama Hongan-ji in present-day Osaka. Nobunaga&#x27;s Siege of Ishiyama Hongan-ji began to slowly make some progress, but the Mōri clan of the Chūgoku region broke his naval blockade and started sending supplies into the strongly fortified complex by sea. As a result, in 1577, Nobunaga ordered Takigawa Kazumasu to suppress Ikko-ikki at Kii Province, Hashiba Hideyoshi to conquer the Chūgoku region from the Mori clan, before advancing upon the Mori clan in Nagato Province, Akechi Mitsuhide to pacify Tanba Province, Kuki Yoshitaka to support attack from the sea, and Nobunaga eventually blocked the Mōri&#x27;s supply lines.

In 1580, ten years after the siege of Ishiyama Hongan-ji began, the son of Chief Abbot Kōsa surrendered the fortress to Nobunaga after their supplies were exhausted, and they received an official request from the Emperor to do so. Nobunaga spared the lives of Ishiyama Hongan-ji&#x27;s defenders but expelled them from Osaka and burnt the fortress to the ground. Although the Ikkō-ikki continued to make a last stand in Kaga Province, Nobunaga&#x27;s capture of Ishiyama Hongan-ji crippled them as a major military force.

===Conflict with Takeda===

One of the strongest rulers in the anti-Nobunaga alliance was Takeda Shingen, who used to be an ally of the Oda clan. At the apex of the anti-Nobunaga coalition, in 1572, Takeda Shingen ordered Akiyama Nobutomo, one of the &quot;Twenty-Four Generals&quot; of Shingen, to attack Iwamura castle. Nobunaga&#x27;s aunt, Lady Otsuya, conspired against the Oda clan, surrendered the castle to the Takeda, and married Nobutomo. From there, the Takeda-Oda relationship declined and Nobunaga started a war against the Takeda clan.

In the same year, Shingen decided to make a drive for Kyoto at the urgings of the shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, starting with invading Tokugawa territory. Nobunaga, tied down on the western front, sent lackluster aid to Tokugawa Ieyasu who suffered defeat at the Battle of Mikatagahara in early 1573. However, after the battle, Tokugawa&#x27;s forces launched night raids and convinced Takeda of an imminent counter-attack, thus saving the vulnerable Tokugawa with the bluff. This would play a pivotal role in Tokugawa&#x27;s philosophy of strategic patience in his campaigns with Nobunaga. Shortly thereafter, the Takeda forces were neutralized after Shingen died in April 1573.

====Battle of Nagashino====

In 1575, Takeda Katsuyori, son of Takeda Shingen, moved to Tokugawa territory, attacked Yoshida castle and later besieged Nagashino Castle. Katsuyori, angered when Okudaira Sadamasa rejoined the Tokugawa, had originally conspired with Oga Yashiro to take the Tokugawa-controlled Okazaki Castle, the capital of Mikawa Province. This plot failed. Tokugawa Ieyasu appealed to Nobunaga for help and Nobunaga personally led an army of about 30,000 men to the relief of Nagashino Castle. The combined force of 38,000 men under Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu defeated and devastated the Takeda clan at the Battle of Nagashino. This battle was the greatest defeat of the Takeda clan.

Conventionally, the &quot;Battle of Nagashino&quot; was regarded as a historic defeat in which Takeda Katsuyori ordered his cavalry to charge recklessly into a horse guard fence where arquebusiers were waiting for them, losing many Takeda officers and soldiers. Moreover, it has been said that Nobunaga developed a new battle strategy called &quot;three-stage shooting&quot;, in which arquebusiers were arranged in several rows with the front row firing a volley, and then making way for the second row to fire. Once the second row had fired and made way for the third row, the first row had reloaded and were ready to fire again. This way the Oda could keep a relatively steady rate of musket fire.
However, this was a theory developed by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff based on Oze Hoan&#x27;s Shinchō Ki and Tōyama Nobuharu&#x27;s Sōken Ki, which are war chronicles. Later, as research based on documents, letters, and Ota Gyūichi&#x27;s &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot; progressed, many errors were pointed out. It is now believed that it was mainly the logistics in Nobunaga&#x27;s hands that determined the winner.

The end of the Takeda clan came in 1582 when Oda Nobutada and Tokugawa Ieyasu forces conquered Shinano and Kai Province. Takeda Katsuyori was defeated at the Battle of Tenmokuzan and then committed suicide.

===End of the Ashikaga Shogunate===

In early 1573, Yoshiaki initiated a siege against Nobunaga under the directive of the monk Kennyo. Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage tried to subdue Yoshiaki. Azai Nagamasa, Matsunaga Hisahide, Sanninshu Miyoshi, Miyoshi Yoshitsugu, and others also participated in the siege against Nobunaga. Although the siege initially cornered Nobunaga&#x27;s forces, it failed, as it was interrupted by the death of Takeda Shingen.

In mid 1573, Yoshiaki began a revolt in Kyoto, he requested the help of the Matsunaga clan and allied with them. Yoshiaki and the Matsunaga clan gathered an army in Makishima castle in April and again in July which is when the revolt started. This angered Nobunaga who took his armies and invaded Kyoto. However, when Matsunaga Hisahide saw the hope for success was not achieved he returned to Nobunaga to fight the Miyoshi.

Nobunaga&#x27;s entry into Kyoto presented him with a situation very different from that from which he had come. Nobunaga reportedly set fire to Kyoto which forced Yoshiaki to retreat. He focused on Ashikaga Yoshiaki, who had openly declared hostility more than once, despite the Imperial Court&#x27;s intervention. Nobunaga was able to defeat Yoshiaki&#x27;s forces, and the power of the Ashikaga was effectively destroyed on 27 August 1573, when Nobunaga drove Yoshiaki out of Kyoto and sent him into exile. Yoshiaki became a Buddhist monk, shaving his head and taking the name &quot;Sho-san&quot;, which he later changed to &quot;Rei-o In&quot;, bringing the Ashikaga Shogunate to an end.

===Imperial Court appointments===

After the Ashikaga Shogunate came to end, the authority of the Imperial Court of Emperor Ōgimachi also began to fall. This trend reversed after Oda Nobunaga entered Kyoto in a show of allegiance that indicated that the Emperor had the Oda clan&#x27;s support.

In 1574, Nobunaga appointed a rank of Lower Third Rank () of the Imperial Court and made a Court Advisor (). Court appointments would continue to be lavished on a nearly annual basis, possibly in hope of placating him. Nobunaga acquired many official titles, including Major Counselor (), General of the Right of the Imperial Army (), and Minister of the Right () in 1576.

===Construction of Azuchi Castle===


Azuchi Castle was built from 1576 to 1579 on Mount Azuchi on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa in Ōmi Province. Nobunaga intentionally built Azuchi Castle close enough to Kyoto that he could watch over and guard the approaches to the capital. Azuchi Castle&#x27;s location was also strategically advantageous in managing the communications and transportation routes between Nobunaga&#x27;s greatest foes - Uesugi to the north, the Takeda in the east, and the Mōri to the west. The castle and its nearby town were depicted on the so-called Azuchi Screens, which Oda Nobunaga gifted to Pope Gregory XIII, who displayed them in the Vatican collections.

===Conflict with Mori===
The fundamental policy of the Mōri clan was &quot;to avoid conflict with Nobunaga,&quot; and in the early 1570s, even when some issues arose, they continued a cautious diplomacy to prevent any decisive confrontations. However, when Terumoto placed Ashikaga Yoshiaki under his protection, war between the two families became inevitable. It happened in 1576 at Battle of Kizugawaguchi, that the Môri were to be drawn into the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War, Nobunaga&#x27;s siege of a religious stronghold in Settsu, which he had begun in 1570.

====Battle of Kizugawaguchi====

Terumoto turned to the vaunted Môri navy. In 1576, First Battle of Kizugawaguchi Nobunaga&#x27;s &#x27;admiral&#x27;, Kuki Yoshitaka, had cut the Honganji&#x27;s sea-lanes and sat in blockade off the coast. Terumoto ordered his fleet, commanded by Murakami Takeyoshi, to make for the waters off Settsu and, once there, the navy inflicted an embarrassing defeat on Kuki and opened the Honganji&#x27;s supply lines.

Later in 1578, at Second Battle of Kizugawaguchi, Kûki Yoshitaka defeated Takeyoshi and drove the Môri away. A further attempt by the Môri to break the blockade the following year was turned back, and in 1580 the Honganji surrendered.

===Conflict with Uesugi===

The conflict between Oda and Uesugi precipitated by Uesugi intervention in the domain of the Hatakeyama clan in Noto Province, an Oda client state. This event provoked the Uesugi incursion, a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; led by the pro-Oda general Chō Tsugutsura, who killed Hatakeyama Yoshinori, the lord of Noto and replaced him with Hatakeyama Yoshitaka as a puppet ruler. As a result, Uesugi Kenshin, the head of the Uesugi clan, mobilized an army and led it into Noto against Tsugutsura. Consequently, Nobunaga sent an army led by Shibata Katsuie and some of his most experienced generals to attack Kenshin. They clashed at the Battle of Tedorigawa in Kaga Province in 1577.

====Battle of Tedorigawa====

In November 1577, The Battle of Tedorigawa took place near the Tedori River in Kaga Province. Kenshin tricked Nobunaga&#x27;s forces into launching a frontal attack across the Tedorigawa and defeated him. Having suffered the loss of 1,000 men, the Oda withdrew south. The result was a decisive Uesugi victory, and Nobunaga considered ceding the northern provinces to Kenshin, but Kenshin&#x27;s sudden death in early 1578 caused a succession crisis that ended the Uesugi&#x27;s movement to the south.

===Tenshō Iga War===
The was two invasions of Iga province by the Oda clan during the Sengoku period. The province was conquered by Oda Nobunaga in 1581 after an unsuccessful attempt in 1579 by his son Oda Nobukatsu. The name of the war is derived from the Tenshō era name (1573–92) in which it occurred. Other names for the campaign include or . Oda Nobunaga himself toured the conquered province in early November 1581, and then withdrew his troops, placing control in Nobukatsu&#x27;s hands.

By 1580s, Nobunaga was the most powerful lord in Japan, controlling 20 provinces in central Japan: Owari, Mino, Omi, Iga, Ise, Yamato, Yamashiro, Kawachi, Wakasa, Settsu, Echizen, Hida, Kaga, Noto, Tango, Tanba, Harima, Inaba, Tajima, and Hōki.

==Death==

By 1582, Nobunaga was at the height of his power and, as the most powerful warlord, the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Japan. Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu finally occupied Shinano and Kai Provinces, defeated the Takeda at the Battle of Tenmokuzan, destroying the clan and resulting in Takeda Katsuyori fleeing from the battle before committing suicide with his wife while being pursued by Oda forces. By this point, Nobunaga was preparing to launch invasions into Etchu Province, Shikoku and Mori clan domain. Nobunaga&#x27;s former sandal-bearer, Hashiba Hideyoshi, invaded Bitchū Province and laid siege to Takamatsu Castle. The castle was vital to the Mori clan, and losing it would have left Mori&#x27;s home domain vulnerable. More reinforcements led by Mōri Terumoto arrived to relieve the siege, prompting Hideyoshi to ask in turn for reinforcements from Nobunaga. Nobunaga immediately ordered his leading generals and also Akechi Mitsuhide to prepare their armies, with the overall expedition to be led by Nobunaga. Nobunaga left Azuchi Castle for Honnō-ji, a temple in Kyoto he frequented when visiting the city, where he was to hold a tea ceremony. Hence, Nobunaga only had 30 pages with him, while his son Oda Nobutada had brought 2,000 of his cavalrymen.

===Honnō-ji incident===
Akechi Mitsuhide, stationed in Tanba province, led his army toward Kyoto under the pretense of following the order of Nobunaga, but as they were crossing Katsura River, he decided to assassinate Nobunaga for unknown reasons. The exact cause of his betrayal remains controversial.

Mitsuhide, aware that Nobunaga was nearby and unprotected for his tea ceremony, saw an opportunity to act. At that time, Mitsuhide is said to have announced to his troops that &quot;The enemy awaits at Honnō-ji!&quot; (敵は本能寺にあり, Teki wa Honnō-ji ni ari). But this is a later creation. In reality, Mitsuhide kept the target of the attack secret from his troops so that information would not leak out.

On 21 June 1582, before dawn, the Akechi army surrounded the Honnō-ji temple with Nobunaga present, while another unit of Akechi troops was sent to Myōkaku-ji in a coup. Although Nobunaga and his servants resisted the unexpected intrusion, they were soon overwhelmed. Nobunaga also fought back for a while before retreating, and after letting the court ladies escape, he committed in one of the inner rooms.

After capturing Honnō-ji, Mitsuhide attacked Nobutada, the eldest son and heir of Nobunaga, who also died by suicide.

Mitsuhide searched for Nobunaga&#x27;s body but could not find it. As a result, he was unable to prove Nobunaga&#x27;s death, thus neither providing justification for his rebellion nor gaining support from those who doubted Nobunaga&#x27;s death.
Later, when Nobunaga&#x27;s retainer Toyotomi Hideyoshi learnt of his lord&#x27;s death, he intercepted Mitsuhide&#x27;s messenger trying to deliver a letter to the Mōri clan, informing them of Nobunaga&#x27;s death and requesting an alliance, and withheld information. Hideyoshi managed to pacify the Mōri by demanding the suicide of Shimizu Muneharu in exchange for ending his siege of Takamatsu Castle, which the Mōri accepted. He then turned back to Kyoto with his forces in a swift forced march known as the &quot;Chūgoku Ōgaeshi&quot;.

Mitsuhide failed to establish his position after Nobunaga&#x27;s death, and Oda forces under Hideyoshi defeated his army at the Battle of Yamazaki in July 1582. During a losing battle, Mitsuhide was killed in an instance of &quot; ochimusha-gari &quot; (落ち武者狩り), a medieval Japanese custom in which local samurai, farmers and bandits hunt fleeing samurai for bounty and the valuables on their person.

Hideyoshi continued and completed Nobunaga&#x27;s conquest of Japan within the following decade.

== Post-death events ==
=== Death and succession ===
The goal of national unification and a return to the comparative political stability of the earlier Muromachi period was widely shared by the multitude of autonomous &quot;daimyō&quot; during the Sengoku period. Oda Nobunaga was the first for whom this goal seemed attainable. He controlled most of Honshu shortly before his death in the Honnō-ji Incident of 1582.

The motive for the rebellion of Akechi Mitsuhide, the vassal who betrayed Nobunaga, remains unclear, partly because Mitsuhide himself did not say anything, and various theories are still being discussed.
After the incident, Mitsuhide declared to the world that he would rule over Nobunaga&#x27;s territory, but was soon defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The loss of his position and power so quickly gave rise to the idiom .

Later, Hideyoshi succeeded in regaining Oda&#x27;s territory and wrested control of it from the Oda clan, further expanding his dominion greatly. And when he was appointed to the highest rank of kuge, Kanpaku, despite being a common-born samurai, and in 1590, eight years after the incident, he achieved the unification of Japan.

After the death of Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu completed the goal of national unification by subjugating local &quot;daimyō&quot; under a hereditary shogunate, which was ultimately accomplished in 1603 when Ieyasu was granted the title of Shogun by Emperor Go-Yōzei following the successful Sekigahara Campaign of 1600.

The nature of the succession of power through the three &quot;daimyō&quot; is reflected in a well-known Japanese idiom:

The changing character of power through Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu is reflected in another well-known idiom:

All three were born within eight years of each other (1534 to 1542), started their careers as samurai, and finished them as statesmen. Nobunaga inherited his father&#x27;s domain at the age of 17, and quickly gained control of Owari Province through . Hideyoshi started his career in Nobunaga&#x27;s army as an but quickly rose up through the ranks as a samurai. Ieyasu initially fought against Nobunaga as the heir of a rival &quot;daimyō&quot;, but later expanded his own inheritance through a profitable alliance with Nobunaga.

=== Later plans ===
In 1579, Nobunaga&#x27;s resignation from his posts as Udaijin (Minister of the Right) and Ukonoe no daisho (Right general of the Imperial Guard) baffled the Imperial Court. This was because Nobunaga, who was on the verge of unifying the country, did not hold an official position that could shake the authority of the Imperial Court.
Therefore, in May 1582, the Imperial Court sent a message to Nobunaga, offering him a government position of his choice among Sei-i Taishōgun, Kanpaku and Dajō-daijin. However, Nobunaga did not give a clear reply and the &#x27;Honnoji Incident&#x27; took place, so it remains unclear what kind of government scheme Nobunaga had in mind. In 1582, Nobunaga was posthumously promoted and given the title of Dajō-daijin and the court rank of ; more than 300 years later, in 1917, he was further promoted and given the rank of .

In the addendum to Luís Fróis&#x27;s 1582 &quot;Annals of Japan&quot; (on Nobunaga&#x27;s death), it is stated that Nobunaga intended to conquer China. According to Fróis, Nobunaga intended to organise a large fleet to conquer China after the unification of Japan and to have his sons divide and rule the territory. However, there is no such statement in Japanese sources, and many researchers doubt its authenticity.

According to Luís Fróis&#x27;s &quot;History of Japan&quot;, Nobunaga attempted to deify himself in his later years by building Sōken-ji in part of Azuchi Castle and installing a stone called Bonsan as a deity to replace him. Frois, a Christian, attributes this to Nobunaga&#x27;s arrogance which drove him to the madness of wanting to be worshipped on earth, and the Honnō-ji Incident was his punishment. Many researchers doubt the authenticity of Frois&#x27;s description, as there is no mention of this in the Japanese sources. However, the existence of Bonsan itself is mentioned in &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot;. As for the reason for his self-deification, it is thought that it was to give legitimacy to those with Oda family blood to rule the country, with a view to after the unification of the country. Later, after their deaths, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu willed themselves to be worshipped as deities, with Hideyoshi being deified as Toyokuni daimyōjin and Ieyasu as Tōshō Daigongen. In Japan, there have been no small number of persons who have become gods since ancient times. However, they were deified by others after they died as human beings, whereas these three are very unique in that they willingly tried to become gods before they died.

== The Imperial Court and the Ashikaga Shogunate ==
Nobunaga led a large army to Kyoto in honour of Ashikaga Shogun Yoshiaki and re-established the Muromachi Shogunate, under which he extended his power into the Kinai region. The conventional theory is that Nobunaga aimed from the outset to overthrow the Muromachi shogunate and clan system and, with Yoshiaki at the top, to seize real power himself, that is to establish a puppet government. In recent years, however, a theory has emerged that Nobunaga and Yoshiaki were good partners and that the final breakdown was due to Yoshiaki&#x27;s betrayal of Nobunaga, and that Nobunaga did not originally intend to overthrow the Muromachi shogunate.

As for the Imperial Court, it was conventionally believed that Nobunaga tried to put pressure on the Imperial Court and destroy the existing order. In recent years, however, it has begun to be thought that Nobunaga may have consistently valued the Emperor and the Imperial Court. For the emperors and court nobles, who had lost their territories to the samurais and were forced to live in poverty without access to financial resources, Nobunaga was a reliable daimyō who made huge donations, and for Nobunaga, his links with the imperial court helped to improve the Oda clan&#x27;s brand image.

==Policies==
After conquering Owari and Mino, Nobunaga used the seal of to promote his vision with a view to unifying the country. &quot;Tenkafubu&quot; means &quot;spreading military power throughout the world&quot;, and it is the idea of ruling the country peacefully, in other words, ending the Warring States period and restoring peace and order. He then put into action a plan for the economic development of the areas he controlled.

Starting with the matchlock gun, Nobunaga paved the way for unifying the country through a chain of innovations, from the development of military technology and new weapons, to the international supply chain for importing raw materials for ammunition, to the development of domestic distribution networks, to the way the territory was governed.
Those innovations were supported by the financial resources obtained through his economic plans.

Oda Nobunaga is known for his implementation of a series of innovative policies, such as and the abolition of the barrier system.
Nobunaga knew that his grandfather and father had gained wealth from the water transportation of Ise Bay by taking control of Tsushima and Atsuta ports. He himself also promoted the commercialization of his territory by increasing the circulation of goods and money through the above policies.
The funds to procure and operate the soldiers, guns, and other weapons that supported the unification of the country were also obtained through this.

Rakuichi Rakuza is an economic policy that aims to revitalize commerce by making it possible for anyone to do business anywhere.
Rakuichi was to allow people to do business anywhere in the castle town, whereas previously they could only do business in designated areas. Rakuza does not recognize the privileges of a monopoly trade association called Za, and guarantees free business.
At that time, samurai families controlled the farmlands and farmers, while temples, shrines, and court nobles controlled the commerce and distribution industry by controlling the Ichi (market) and Za (union). Nobunaga&#x27;s promotion of raku-ichi raku-za was intended to deprive temples, shrines and court nobles of their privileges and allow the warrior class to dominate the territory in all areas.

Nobunaga abolished the barrier posts within his domain and allowed the free passage of goods. He also ordered the construction and improvement of roads and bridges of the Kinai region. He built bridges across inlets and rivers, chiseled out rocks to make steep roads more gradual, widened roads to three and a half meters, and planted pine trees and willows on both sides of them. Nobunaga developed not only land transportation, but also maritime transportation, including the waterways of Lake Biwa and the sea routes of Ise Bay and the Seto Inland Sea. These measures enabled not only the free passage of people but also the free transportation of goods, thus facilitating distribution. The development of logistics has brought benefits not only economically but also militarily, allowing soldiers and munitions to be delivered to the battlefield quickly and reliably.
In general, Nobunaga thought in terms of &quot;unifying factors&quot;, in the words of George Sansom.

The Sengoku Daimyō of the time did not change their strongholds, and had to return to their home after each battle, making it difficult for the Takeda, Uesugi, and other clans far from Kyoto to go to Kyoto. However, Nobunaga continued to move his stronghold as his territory expanded in order to control Kyoto, which was essential for unifying the country.
He moved from one base to another, from Shobata, Kiyosu, Komakiyama, Gifu, and Azuchi, and his castle in Osaka, the diplomatic and economic center of East Asia, was under construction shortly before his death. He always based in the nodes of regional distribution and ensured the maintenance of public peace in the area, thereby promoting the development of the local economy and the concentration of capital in the cities.

Backed by his enormous economic power, Nobunaga overwhelmed his opponents by building stone-wall castles such as Komakiyama Castle and Azuchi Castle, which consumed more labor and financial resources than conventional castles, and by constructing economic cities (castle towns) connected to them. In other words, Nobunaga politically appealed his power throughout the country through civil engineering projects such as the construction of castles. Toyotomi Hideyoshi followed suit and built Ishigakiyama Castle and Osaka Castle.

Nobunaga implemented financial reforms that introduced a new monetary system. In 1569, the &quot;Oda Nobunaga Eiroku 12 Law&quot; was enacted, which is regarded by some as &quot;the beginning of early modern monetary policy in Japan&quot;. It was an epoch-making attempt to &quot;increase the volume of money in circulation&quot; and &quot;prevent the inflow of bad money&quot; at the same time. A fixed exchange rate system was introduced, and coins, which had been mixed in disorderly fashion, were clearly defined as standard coins and deteriorated coins. The Oda Clan&#x27;s guarantee has given value to coins that were considered degraded coins in other regions, revived many coins that had been excluded from trade, and stabilised commercial transactions. At the same time, by differentiating the value of coins according to their exchange rate, the government prevented an excessive influx of deteriorated coins. Nobunaga also used gold and silver as currency to trade in high-value commodities. Nobunaga himself played a role in expanding the circulation of gold and silver by using gold and silver for purchases in .

One of the attainments of Nobunaga&#x27;s government, which aimed to unify the country, was , which began in earnest in 1580, starting with the Kinai region. It is an administrative measure that requires the daimyō under his command to submit their harvest in the form of kokudaka figures. This was succeeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s .

When asked by the Emperor and the Muromachi Shogun to assume the post of Vice Shogun, and offered the post of kanrei, which was effectively the highest rank in samurai society, Nobunaga declined and instead requested permission to rule directly over three of Japan&#x27;s largest distribution centres, Sakai (Izumi province), Kusatsu and Ōtsu (Ōmi Province).
Sakai, an autonomous city, was enjoying its golden days as an international trading port, overflowing with goods, the latest science and technology, and information from East Asia and the West, despite the territorial expansion wars of the Sengoku Daimyōs.
What Nobunaga sought from the merchants of Sakai was their enormous wealth, as well as their expertise in the Nanban trade and their own trade routes to obtain raw materials for guns and gunpowder. Nobunaga took Imai Sōkyū, an upstart merchant from Sakai, under his control. Imai established Japan&#x27;s first comprehensive military industry and supported Nobunaga&#x27;s unification of Japan by mass-producing guns and securing an exclusive trading route for the import of potassium nitrate, a raw material for gunpowder that was not produced in Japan. Tsuda Sōgyū, a key figure in Sakai&#x27;s self-governing organization, also severed ties with Hongan-ji and submitted to Nobunaga. Nobunaga demanded a large amount of war funds from Sakai. Sakai merchants initially refused, but were persuaded by Sōkyū and Sōgyū to accept it. Thus, Nobunaga obtained Sakai without fighting. Imai Sōkyū, Tsuda Sōgyū, and Sen Sōeki (later Sen no Rikyu) were appointed as Nobunaga&#x27;s tea masters and secured their positions as political merchants.

Nobunaga made personnel decisions based on ability and results, not titles. Until then, the family culture of warlords had been one of respecting family lineage and passing down positions from generation to generation, but Nobunaga made a major shift to a personnel system based on merit. It is known that Hashiba Hideyoshi came from a poor peasant background in Owari, while Akechi Mitsuhide came from a samurai background in Mino, but had spent a long time as a poor ronin. These two men caught up with and eventually overtook Nobunaga&#x27;s old vassals, including Shibata Katsuie, Niwa Nagahide, Sakuma Nobumori, and others. Among the Oda vassals, Mitsuhide was the first to become &quot;the lord of one province and one castle&quot;, and the second was Hideyoshi. This was unthinkable for other Sengoku Daimyō.

==Military==
Militarily, Nobunaga changed the way war was fought in Japan.

An unprecedented military revolution was taking place in Japan at the time.
Through a military revolution using the new technology of matchlock guns, he ended the Sengoku period of decentralization and moved Japan into the early modern era of centralization.
Nobunaga was the first of the other sengoku daimyo to own and utilise a large number of firearms from an early date.
He changed the perception that matchlock guns, commonly known as , were unsuitable for actual combat due to their short range and inability to fire continuously, to the perception that they were invincible weapons by deploying in large numbers firing them all at once.
Local historiography &quot;Kunitomo Teppoki&quot; states that Nobunaga had already recognised the potential of guns in 1549, six years after they were introduced to Japan, and put Hashimoto Ippa in charge of gun production, and that 500 guns were completed in 1550. &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot; also mentions that he learnt marksmanship from Hashimoto Ippa around 1550.
Four years later, in 1554, he fielded guns for the first time at the Battle of Muraki Castle, where Nobunaga replaced his guns one after the other and fired them himself, taking the fort in a single day. The Battle of Nagashino in 1575 is famous for the continuous firing of guns, but Nobunaga had already carried it out 21 years earlier.
Documents left behind in Sakai, which was under the direct control of Nobunaga, describing the manufacture of guns reveal that Japan had already become the world&#x27;s leading gun power, with mass production based on a division of labour for each part. Radiological analysis also revealed that Japanese-made guns using the Japanese sword forging technique were more stable in strength and more powerful because they contained fewer impurities.
Although a mass production system for guns had been established, there was still no daimyō capable of providing a stable supply of ammunition. Nobunaga was the first to make this possible. He had established an international supply chain to import raw materials for ammunition from China and Southeast Asia through Portuguese merchants by putting international port cities such as Sakai under his direct control and protecting the Jesuits.
Later, during the Tokugawa period, Japan exported large quantities of no longer needed firearms to the Netherlands, along with swords and other weapons.

Nobunaga had the previously disparate spear lengths aligned to 3 ken (about ) or 3 and a half ken (about ). The spear lengths used in the Sengoku period were generally 2 ken (). However, when Nobunaga was a teenager, he saw his comrades beating each other with spears in a mock battle and had his army replace their own spears with longer ones, as short spears were useless.
The way spears were used in those days was for miscellaneous soldiers under Ashigaru with long spears to form a line and advance, swinging their spears down from above as if they were striking rather than stabbing. This alone was powerful enough, and if the long spearmen formed a with their spearheads facing forward, they could sufficiently counter cavalry units, so the effect was enormous.

Nobunaga introduced civil engineering not only in the political field but also in the military field. He turned the battle into a large-scale civil engineering project. This was clearly beyond the scope of preparations for a favorable outcome of the war. He invaded enemy territory in force, mobilizing construction workers, carpenters, blacksmiths, founders, miners, and others to construct roads and build tsunagi-jiro (linking castle). In attacking castles, he adopted the tsukejiro (attaching castle) strategy of which building numerous fortifications around enemy castles and narrowing the siege while moving. Toyotomi Hideyoshi took charge of the works as a field supervisor under Nobunaga and later took over his methods.

Nobunaga is thought to have favored gambling tactics such as surprise attacks because of the Battle of Okehazama, but in reality, he preferred to use overwhelming military power to overpower his opponents.

Nobunaga tried to create a standing army by implementing the separation of soldiers and farmers. Samurais at that time were half-farmers and half-soldiers who spent most of their time as farmers, and only fought at the behest of their lords, who were also the owners of the farmland, in times of war. Therefore, they could not fight much during the busy farming season from summer to autumn.
Nobunaga, on the other hand, attempted to separate soldiers from farmers, although not as thoroughly as Toyotomi Hideyoshi later did. Each time Nobunaga moved his base of operations, he promoted the concentration of his vassals under his castles. As a result, the separation of troops and agriculture was promoted, allowing for planned group training and the formation of army units of different types , such as firearms units and cavalry units.

Daimyo&#x27;s bodyguards and messengers were called , and Nobunaga divided them into two groups. One group had a red Horo (cloak) on their backs, so they were called , and the other had a black Horo (cloak) on their backs, so they were called . The leader of Akahoro-shū was Maeda Toshiie and the leader of Kurohoro-shū was Sassa Narimasa.

Nobunaga placed great importance on intelligence warfare. After the Battle of Okehazama, he most highly valued Yanada Masatsuna, who reported every movement of the Imagawa forces that day, rather than the samurais who actually defeated Yoshimoto.

Nobunaga adopted a system of area armies, which enabled him to react in multiple regions simultaneously, and operated it in a large scale.
*Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s sphere of influence and the departments of each area armies.
**Chugoku Front: Hashiba Hideyoshi
**Kinai Front: Akechi Mitsuhide
**Shikoku Front: Niwa Nagahide
**Hokuriku Front: Shibata Katsuie
**Kanto Front: Takigawa Kazumasu

Nobunaga&#x27;s army had an unthinkable military rule, known as the , whereby all vassals, including ashigaru and lower-ranking ones, were to be put to death if they stole even a single penny. In those days, it was common practice for sengoku daimyo such as Takeda and Uesugi to allow their vassals to raid nearby villages, pillage and assault them if they won a battle. They rather entered the war for the profits to be gained from the looting. After the battle was over, it was also common for traffickers to set up markets to sell the captured people. However, Nobunaga denied this and forbade the soldiers under his command from looting and violence against the people. On the contrary, food and other supplies were bought for a price. Furthermore, he took a tough attitude towards roadside bandits who stood in the way of trade. As a result, after Nobunaga united Owari, security improved to the extent that merchants could take naps on the roadside. These actions enabled Nobunaga to gain the support of the people and move towards unifying the country. Strict military discipline was inherited by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu, who recognized it as an important factor in gaining public support.

Nobunaga is said to have used six armored ships in the Second Battle of Kizugawaguchi in 1578.
Nobunaga, who suffered a heavy blow at the First Battle of the Kizugawaguchi from hōraku-hiya of the Murakami Suigun, the core of the Mori Suigun, ordered Kuki Yoshitaka to build iron-armoured ships to repel the Mori Suigun attempting to bring provisions and other supplies to the Osaka Hongan-ji.

They are thought to have been large wooden ships, Atakebune, covered with iron plates, with cannons on the front and arrows and guns on the sides, with two or three tiers of turrets on the upper deck. However, as no actual ships have survived and historical documents are inadequately described, there are many theories about the appearance and structure of iron-armoured ships. Some believe that they were not actually iron-armoured ships, but simply European-style black ships, or that they may not have been completely covered with iron plates, but only important parts were covered with iron. It is also said that iron-armoured ships were intended to intimidate rather than attack, and could not move much themselves, and were more like fortress-like ships floating on the sea.

In Tamon&#x27;in Eishun&#x27;s &quot;Tamon&#x27;in Diary&quot;, there are passages which state that the ship was &quot;a ship of iron&quot; and &quot;prepared to prevent guns (bullets) from going through&quot;, and this is the only historical document that provides evidence that the ship was armoured with iron plates. Some argue that since &quot;Tamon&#x27;in Diary&quot; is a primary historical source, its account should be trusted, but it is only hearsay and was not witnessed by Eishun himself. On the other hand, the Jesuit missionary Organtino, who actually observed the ships, wrote in his report that it resembled a Portuguese ship and was surprised that such a ship had been built in Japan. If they were similar to the Portuguese ships of the time (galleons), it is assumed that they would have been very different from Atakebune, a keelless riverboat. The ships were also said to be equipped with three cannons and numerous elaborate and large long guns. &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot; (manuscript) mentions that &quot;big guns&quot; were powerful in naval battles, but does not say whether they were actually iron-armoured.

==Culture==
Nobunaga initiated a period in Japanese art history known as Fushimi, or the Azuchi-Momoyama period, in reference to the area south of Kyoto. He built extensive gardens and castles which were themselves great works of art. Azuchi Castle included a seven-story Tenshukaku, which included a treasury filled with gold and precious objects. Works of art included paintings on movable screens (&quot;byōbu&quot;), sliding doors (&quot;fusuma&quot;), and walls by Kanō Eitoku.

Nobunaga promoted the tea ceremony. Not only that, he is said to have built trust with his subordinates by successfully utilizing the system for political use of the tea ceremony, which Toyotomi Hideyoshi later named .
He actively promoted the value of the tea ceremony in samurai society, giving it a value equal to the fiefdom and rank he received from his lord. He transformed the values of the samurai through the following three actions.
# Collecting: He collected and monopolised famous tea utensils. In other words, .
# Presentation: He presented his own specialty tea utensils that he had acquired at a tea ceremony.
# Bestowal: He gifted of specialty tea utensils were given to vassals who had made meritorious achievements.
Nobunaga held tea ceremonies with limited participants and showed his authority by displaying his tea utensils, making it known that the tea ceremony was a samurai ritual. He forbade his vassals to hold tea ceremonies, but allowed those who made special achievements to hold tea ceremonies by giving them tea utensils. The vassals then began to take pleasure in Nobunaga&#x27;s bestowal of specialties and to feel great honor in being allowed to hold tea ceremonies. Thus, among the warriors, the specialty tea utensils and the holding of tea ceremonies became of special value, and they began to covet tea utensils more than the territory given to them by their lord.

Nobunaga was famous for his great love of sumo, and frequently held sumo tournaments at Jōraku-ji in Azuchi between 1570 and 1581, the year before his death.
In the beginning, the tournament attracted braggarts from all over Ōmi Province, but gradually it began to draw from Kyoto and other regions. The largest tournament was held in 1578 at Mount Azuchi, with 1,500 participants.
The main reason for organising the tournament was, of course, that Nobunaga was a great lover of sumo. But there was also the practical advantage of selecting young men of good physique and martial prowess, and the aim was to demonstrate Nobunaga&#x27;s authority by putting on a big show, while at the same time relieving popular discontent by making it fun for everyone.
Regarding the relationship between Nobunaga and sumo, there is a theory that the Yumitorishiki (bow-twirling ceremony) and the format in which sumo wrestlers are divided into East and West and judged by a gyōji (sumo referee) were born out of the sumo tournament organised by Nobunaga.
As for the theory that Nobunaga is the origin of the &#x27;East-West&#x27; sumo ranking system, there are actually historical documents in Omi Hachiman City that support this relationship.
In 1581, Nobunaga, who was enjoying a fire festival with his vassals dressed up in Nanban costumes, had them perform take-zumō (bamboo wrestling) using bamboos of firecracker.
He praised the two boasts of strength had fought to a draw, and as a reward, he gave the surnames to Denzo, who entered the ring from the east, and to Umejiro, who entered the ring from the west.

It is said that razor blades became popular in Japan when Nobunaga Oda used them to create a samurai hair style, sakayaki. The razor blade is said to have arrived in Japan around 538. This was the year that Buddhism was introduced to Japan, and razor blades were also introduced as a Buddhist implement for monks to shave their heads.
Razor blades were expensive and also sacred Buddhist implements, so even afterwards it remained common to use wooden tweezers for grooming hair and beards. Samurai warriors also used tweezers to remove hair, but it was painful, time-consuming, and caused the pores to become fester. It is said that the rationalist Nobunaga therefore shaved sakayaki with a razor blade, which led to the use of razor blades among samurai. Shaving the sakayaki was a fashionable hairstyle that townspeople began to imitate, and became established in the Edo period. It is said that this has made the use of razor blades commonplace for the general public.

The first known African person in Japan came with a Jesuit delegation in 1579 and was then employed by Oda Nobunaga for 15 months (1581–1582) as a retainer. His African name and birthplace are unknown; he was given the name Yasuke.

== Religion ==
Nobunaga did not actively believe in any particular god or Buddha himself, according to Jesuit scholar Luís Fróis he told people there was no afterlife but he did not deny that he was an adherent of Hokke-shū, and it was common for him to pray for victory and to visit temples and shrines. He never denied or suppressed the beliefs of others for any reason, and was even willing to help and shelter them if they asked for help. Nobunaga rather respected them as long as they did not associate with the various daimyōs or meddle in politics like fixers, but rather devoted themselves to their main task as religious people. In fact, for temples and shrines that do not go beyond their main religious duties, he has made donations, paid for repairs to facilities and relieved them of their territories.

It is sometimes said that Nobunaga hated Buddhism because of his wars with Hongan-ji, his suppression of Ikkō-ikki, his fire attack against Mt. Hiei and his attacks on Mt. Kōya, but this is a great misconception. It is true that he showed no mercy, even to monks, but this was not because he hated Buddhism. There is a saying that if you kill a monk, you will be cursed for seven generations, but unlike most daimyōs of the time, Nobunaga simply did not have such a taboo. Nobunaga only fought Buddhist forces as thoroughly as he had fought other Sengoku Daimyōs, and while it is true that he killed thousands of monks and tens of thousands of believers, he never forbade their faith itself. Nobunaga would forgive them if they complied with his advice to surrender, but if they did not, he would send a large army to massacre them and try to suppress them through fear.

The Ikkō-shū (Jodo Shinshu Honganji Order) was very powerful at the time. The Osaka Hongan-ji (later Ishiyama Hongan-ji) was an armed group comparable to the Sengoku Daimyō, controlling territory and employing as mercenaries the Saika-shū of Kii Province, who were skilled in the use of guns. The Ishiyama Hongan-ji War was a war that began when Nobunaga, who considered Osaka his future base, ordered the Osaka Honganji to withdraw from Osaka. Kennyo issued a proclamation to his followers to overthrow Nobunaga, and they rose up in anti-Nobunaga ranks. Honganji then laid siege to Nobunaga with Takeda, Asakura, Azai, Mōri and others. Ikkō-ikki were a nationwide trans-religious resistance movement against lords and rulers of the secular realm, organized by the Hongan-ji Order. Nobunaga attempted to isolate the Osaka Hongan-ji by exterminating the Ikkō-ikki in various parts of the country. Nobunaga&#x27;s massacre is generally criticized, but there is also the view that Nobunaga had no choice but to massacre them as a result of Hongan-ji Temple&#x27;s request for thorough resistance from its followers. In the case of Mount Hiei and Mount Koya, they were attacked because they had joined the daimyōs who were hostile to Nobunaga or sheltered defeated soldiers.

Nobunaga allowed the Jesuits to proselytise Christianity and sheltered their activities in Japan. This was because the use of matchlocks, which were absolutely necessary for warfare, was impossible without the Nanban trade, and because the Nanban trade required Jesuit mediation and diplomacy with Portugal. Although domestic production of guns themselves had already begun, nitre for the gunpowder and lead for the bullets were rarely produced in Japan at the time, so the only way to secure large quantities was to seize routes brought in from overseas by Portuguese merchant ships. The Jesuits also actively backed Nobunaga because they considered him to be the closest person to unifying the country. Above all, it was best to borrow Nobunaga&#x27;s help to destroy the Buddhist power, which was their greatest enemy.

== Personality and reputation ==
=== Personality ===
Luís Fróis described Nobunaga in his &quot;History of Japan&quot; as &quot;of medium height and lean build, with a thin moustache and a very clear voice&quot;. Regarding his height, in &quot;Jesuit Japan Correspondence – Luís Fróis Letter&quot; of 1 June 1568, he also describes him as &quot;tall and lean, with a very high voice&quot;.
His height is estimated to be 5 shaku 5 or 6 sun () tall based on a life-size seated wooden statue of him left at Daitoku-ji and the armour he is said to have used.

According to Fróis, he had great understanding and clear judgment, disdained gods, Buddha and other idols, and did not believe in any pagan divination. His sect was the Lotus sect, but he preached in high spirits that there is no creator of the universe, that the spirit is not immortal, and that nothing exists after death, and there are no awards or punishments in the afterlife.

He was extremely fond of warfare, devoted to the practice of martial arts, and was coarse. He was arrogant but honourable, strict in righteousness and enjoyed the deeds of justice and mercy. When others insulted him, he did not hesitate to punish them, but in certain matters he showed amiability and mercy.

He was also temperamental, though not greedy, and could be prone to temper tantrums. He was secretive in his decisions and extremely cunning in his strategies. He was magnanimous and patient, even when the fortunes of war seemed to be against him. He had a somewhat melancholy shadow, but when it came to difficult schemes, he was fearless, and people followed his orders in everything.

He was seldom disciplined, rarely swayed by the advice of his vassals, and was extremely feared and respected by all. He despised all the daimyō of Japan and spoke to them condescendingly, as if they were his subordinate retainers, and the people obeyed him as if he were an absolute monarch. On the other hand, he also spoke cordially with a very lowly and despised servant.

He did not drink, ate sparingly, did not sleep much and was an early riser. He liked his house to be clean and was meticulous in his instructions on various matters. When talking to people, he disliked long conversations and lengthy preliminaries. He particularly liked the famous vessels of the tea ceremony, good horses, swords and falconry. He also loved watching people perform sumo naked in front of him, regardless of status.

Nobunaga&#x27;s many great achievements were also thanks to the education of his father, Nobuhide. Originally, Nobuhide was only one of the three magistrates of Kiyosu, rather than the whole of Owari, but he gained so much power that he overpowered the Shugodai who ruled Owari. Nobuhide was not only a brilliant military man, but was also a well-known cultural figure in Kyoto. However, he believed that doing the same thing as himself at the turn of the age would no longer work, did not give Nobunaga the same education as himself at all. Nobuhide let Nobunaga do only what he wanted to do and what he was good at. As a result, he had no complexes about anything or anyone.

A letter left by Luis Frois states that in response to a letter from Takeda Shingen signed , Nobunaga signed back . Takeda Shingen cited Nobunaga&#x27;s Fire Attack against Mount Hiei, the head temple of the Tendai sect, as the reason for his hostility to Nobunaga, and to emphasise this and gain support from Buddhist forces, he took the name of Tendai Zasu, indicating that he was the head of Enryaku-ji. In reality, however, Shingen was not a Tendai Zasu or even a believer in the Tendai sect, and it is said that Nobunaga may have referred to himself as the Demon King to mock Shingen&#x27;s own choice of title.

=== Reputation in youth ===
The young Nobunaga was famous for his bizarre outfit and eccentric behaviour, and people called him . At that time, he was dressed in his yukatabira sleeves removed, half hakama with a flint pouch and others hanging from it, his hair tied into a chasen-mage with crimson or light green threads, a sword in a vermilion sheath, and all his attendants carried vermilion arms. He also devoured fruits and mochi standing up without caring about the public gaze in the streets, or walked in a dishevelled manner, leaning on others or hanging on their shoulders.

Nobunaga had no particular pastimes, but practised horsemanship in the morning and evening, and from spring to summer he would go into the river to practice water drills. He also learnt archery from Ichikawa Daisuke, marksmanship from Hashimoto Ippa and military tactics from Hirata Sanmi. Also at that time, he watched a mock battle using bamboo spears and said that spears could not be used if they were too short, so he had all his spears replaced with longer ones of 3 ken () or 3 and a half ken ().
At the funeral of his father Nobuhide, his younger brother Nobuyuki (Nobukatsu) wore a formal kataginu and long hakama and burnt incense according to etiquette, while Nobunaga came without long hakama, with his hair tied in a chasen-mage, a tachi sword and a wakizashi with a long handle wrapped in straw rope. He then grabbed some powdered incense, threw it at the tablets and walked away.

At a meeting between Nobunaga and his father-in-law, Saito Dōsan, Dōsan sneaked a peek to determine what kind of man his son-in-law was before they actually met. Then Nobunaga appeared with his hair tied up in a chasen-mage with a light green flat cord, wearing a yukatabira with one sleeve off, a tachi sword and wakizashi with gold and silver flakes pasted on the sheath and the long handle wrapped in straw rope, a thick taro stem rope as an arm band, seven or eight flint pouches and gourds hanging around his waist like monkey trainers, and a half hakama made of four pieces of tiger and leopard leather. According to &quot;&quot;, a compilation of stories by local elders, he also had a large picture of a penis dyed on the back of his yukatabira. On the other hand, he was accompanied by a large contingent of a peculiarly organized force of 500 long spearmen and 500 archers and matchlock troops. Dōsan went to the meeting place in his regular clothes, thinking that he would not need formal attire if he were to meet such a fool, but Nobunaga changed back into his haori and long hakama, and for the first time in his life, he appeared in formal attire with his hair neatly folded in futatsu-ori. On the way home, Dōsan&#x27;s retainers laughed at him, saying, &quot;Nobunaga was a fool after all&quot;, but Dōsan replied, &quot;That is why I am frustrated. My children will be under the command of that fool in the future&quot;, he said with a bitter look on his face.

=== Changes in public opinion ===
Nowadays Oda Nobunaga is one of Japan&#x27;s most popular historical figures. Despite his brutal image, Nobunaga is widely recognised for his appeal as an innovator who more than compensated for his shortcomings. However, the image of Nobunaga has changed significantly during the Edo period, from the Meiji to the early Shōwa era, and since World War II.

Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s reputation in the Edo period was rather negative overall. The biggest hero of the time was Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Edo Shogunate, but he had a surprisingly low public profile, as he was deified and could not be easily treated in popular culture. The most popular figure among the common people was Hideyoshi, who rose from peasant to ruler of the country.

In the late Edo period, he finally received high praise in Rai San&#x27;yō&#x27;s &quot;Nihon Gaishi&quot; (1827). However, San&#x27;yō evaluated Nobunaga from the perspective of imperial ideology more than he evaluated his military strategies. San&#x27;yō interpreted Nobunaga&#x27;s project to unify the whole country as being in the interests of the Emperor.

In the Meiji era, Nobunaga was still not highly regarded. This changed in the Taishō era when the journalist Tokutomi Sohō took up Nobunaga&#x27;s innovations and gave him high praise for his continuous firing of guns and the abolition of customs checkpoints. However, what Sohō considered most important was still Nobunaga as a kinnoka (imperialist) who ended the shogunate government that lasted from Kamakura to Muromachi and emphasized the imperial court. With militarism on the rise, academism also encouraged the image of Nobunaga as an innovator and loyalist.
On the other hand, the General Staff of the former Imperial Japanese Army studied the battles of Okehazama and Nagashino, and highly evaluated Nobunaga as a tactician.

However, after the Second World War, as a result of the elimination of the imperialist view of history, it came to be thought that Nobunaga should be seen simply as a military commander and a politician. This is because the research style had changed from one based on war tales, such as &quot;Hoan Shinchō Ki&quot;, to one based on ancient documents. Gradually, Nobunaga&#x27;s progressive nature began to be discussed and his image as the &quot;favourite of the times&quot; took root. As a result, the pre-war image of Nobunaga as an imperialist disappeared and a new image of Nobunaga as a revolutionary who destroyed the old order and challenged established authority emerged. However, the latest research, perhaps as a reaction to this, has shown a marked tendency to believe that Nobunaga did not uproot the existing system but came to terms with vested interests and promoted gradual reforms, and some assess that he was in fact a conservative daimyō.

=== In popular culture ===

In recent years, Nobunaga appears frequently in fiction and continues to be portrayed in many different anime, manga, video games, and cinematic films, very often wearing a Western-style mustache and a red European cape allegedly gifted to him.

However, it was after World War II that Oda Nobunaga became popular.
Nobunaga had previously appeared as Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s lord in various &quot;Taikōki&quot; in which Hideyoshi played a leading role, such as &quot;Ehon Taikōki&quot; published in the Edo period and Yoshikawa Eiji&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Shinsho Taikōki&quot;, written during World War II, but in short he was a supporting character.
Nobunaga was often portrayed as a tyrant in variations of the &quot;Taikōki&quot;, where his lack of virtue and narrow-mindedness were often emphasised, although his abilities were appreciated.
An exception is Eiji Yoshikawa&#x27;s &quot;Taikōki&quot;, in which he was a firm but benevolent lord.

The post-War image of Nobunaga began with writer Sakaguchi Ango&#x27;s &quot;Oda Nobunaga&quot;. He described Nobunaga as a rationalist to the bone.

Nobunaga first gained popularity in Japan with the hit film &quot;Fū-unji: Oda Nobunaga&quot; (1959), an adaptation of the novel &quot;Oda Nobunaga&quot; (1955–60) by historical novelist Yamaoka Sōhachi.

The popularity of Nobunaga was determined by the success of Shiba Ryōtarō&#x27;s novel &quot;Kunitori Monogatari&quot; (1963–1966).
Shiba positioned Nobunaga as a revolutionary with a clear will, a rarity in Japanese history, and established an image of Nobunaga in which light and shadow coexisted, not only evaluating his innovativeness but also criticising his brutality.
However, he was not yet absolutely popular at the start of the serialisation and was a double starring with Akechi Mitsuhide.
On the contrary, the original protagonist was his father-in-law, Saito Dōsan, and Nobunaga was not planned to appear. However, due to its popularity, Shiba was not allowed to finish the series and had no choice but to bring out Nobunaga and make it a two-part series.
In 1973, Taiga drama based on this story was made.
After that, many Taiga dramas were made with him as the main character.

Tsuji Kunio&#x27;s novel &quot;The Signore: Shogun of the Warring States&quot; (安土往還記, 1968), in the form of a letter by the crew of a ship carrying missionaries to Japan, won the Ministry of Education&#x27;s Art Encouragement Prize for New Artists.

Nobunaga in Kurosawa Akira&#x27;s film &quot;Kagemusha&quot; (1980) is not the protagonist, but he is the originator of the image of him in current fictional works, wearing a mustache, a cloak and western armour and drinking red wine.

Mayumura Taku&#x27;s SF novel &quot;Toki no Tabibito: Time Stranger&quot; (1977–1978) is the originator of the plot in which a modern man travels back in time to the Sengoku period and meets Oda Nobunaga, and was made into an anime in 1986.

His rise is chronicled in the Netflix docufiction series &quot;The Age of the Samurai, the Bloody Origins of Japan&quot; released in 2021 and then in Keishi Ōtomo&#x27;s film &quot;The Legend and Butterfly&quot; released in 2023.

The anime &quot;Yōtōden&quot; (1987–1988) was the forerunner of the type of work in which the &#x27;Demon King&#x27; Nobunaga stands in the way of the protagonists.
From this anime onwards, more and more films portrayed him not just as a villain or a brutal figure, but literally as a demonic being.
He is portrayed as evil or megalomaniacal in some anime and manga series including &quot;Samurai Deeper Kyo&quot; and &quot;Flame of Recca&quot;.
Yamada Masaki&#x27;s novel &quot;Ōka Ninpōchō: Basilisk Shinshō&quot; (2015) and its anime and manga &quot;Basilisk: Ōka Ninpōchō&quot;, based on Yamada Futaro&#x27;s novel &quot;The Kouga Ninja Scrolls&quot; and its anime and manga &quot;Basilisk&quot;, portray Nobunaga as a literal demon in addition to a power-mad warlord.

In video games, the branding of Nobunaga began in the 1980s with Koei&#x27;s &quot;Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition&quot; series.
And it was not until the 21st century that Nobunaga played the role of the Demon King in the video game world, starting with Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Onimusha&quot; (2001) and &quot;Sengoku Basara&quot; (2005) and Koei&#x27;s &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; (2004). The &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; design for Nobunaga is also seen in Pokémon Conquest (2012), known in Japan as &quot;Pokémon + Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition&quot;

While many works portray Nobunaga&#x27;s character as a cruel monarch or demonic in nature, there are just as many works that portray him in a positive or neutral light.
This is particularly true of Japanese live-action films and TV dramas.

Nobunaga has been portrayed numerous times in a more neutral or historical framework, particularly in the &quot;taiga&quot; drama series produced and broadcast by NHK in Japan.

The film &quot;Goemon&quot; portrays him as a saintly mentor of Ishikawa Goemon.

Nobunaga is also portrayed in a heroic light in some video games such as &quot;Kessen III&quot;, &quot;Ninja Gaiden II&quot;, and the &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; series, while in the anime series &quot;Nobunaga no Shinobi&quot; Nobunaga is portrayed as a kind person as well as having a major sweet tooth.

By contrast, in the novel &quot;The Samurai&#x27;s Tale&quot; by Erik Christian Haugaard, he is portrayed as an antagonist &quot;known for his merciless cruelty&quot;.

Nobunaga is portrayed as evil, villainous, bloodthirsty, and/or demonic in many video games, such as the &quot;Onimusha&quot; series, &quot;Ninja Master&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Maplestory&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Atlantica Online&quot;, the &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; series, the &quot;Sengoku BASARA series&quot; (and its anime adaptation), and the &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; series.

Oda Nobunaga appears in the manga series &quot;Tail of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Kacchū no Senshi Gamu&quot;.

Historical representations in video games (mostly Western-made strategy or action titles) include &quot;&quot;, &quot;Total War: Shogun 2&quot;, &quot;Throne of Darkness&quot;, the eponymous &quot;Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition&quot; series, as well as &quot;Civilization V&quot;, &quot;Age of Empires II: The Conquerors&quot;, &quot;Nioh&quot;, and &quot;Nioh 2&quot;.
Kamenashi Kazuya of the Japanese pop group KAT-TUN wrote and performed a song titled &quot;1582&quot; which is written from the perspective of Mori Ranmaru during the coup at Honnō temple.

Nobunaga has also been portrayed in fiction, such as when the figure of Nobunaga influences a story or inspires a characterization. In James Clavell&#x27;s novel &quot;Shōgun&quot;, the character Goroda is a pastiche of Nobunaga. In the film &quot;Sengoku Jieitai 1549&quot;, Nobunaga is killed by time-travelers.
Nobunaga also appears as a major character in the eroge &quot;Sengoku Rance&quot; and is a playable character in &quot;Pokémon Conquest&quot;, with his partner Pokémon being Hydreigon, Rayquaza and Zekrom.

Nobunaga Oda exists also in the lore of the mobile game Fate/Grand Order and the manga series KOHA-ACE, as a playable character under various depictions and oftentimes shown with a very brash and carefree personality.

== Portraits and statues ==

The most famous portrait of Oda Nobunaga is (Kamishimo style) by Kanō Motohide, a National Important Cultural Property, owned by Chōkō-ji in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture. Another important cultural property is (Sokutai style) in the collection of the Kobe City Museum.

There are also two other portraits, one in kamishimo and the other in sokutai, painted by Kanō Eitoku, one of the leading painters of the Azuchi–Momoyama period. A 2011 survey revealed that the kamishimo used for the memorial service had been redrawn from the original painting. The picture on the front is sober, but the first picture on the back remained in coloring is a gorgeous design with different colors on the left and right of the kosode, and an extra sword. Both ends of the mustache, which were sloppily lowered in the front painting, were raised on the reverse side, giving the face a dignified appearance. It is speculated that Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who came to power after Nobunaga&#x27;s death, ordered the redrawing to make Nobunaga look weak.

The wooden statue of Lord Oda Nobunaga, owned by Sōken-in of Daitoku-ji, is a seated statue of Nobunaga wearing ceremonial clothes and a sword, approximately 115 cm tall. It is said that this is one of the two wooden statues carved out of fragrant wood (agarwood) for the first anniversary of Nobunaga&#x27;s death, and the other was placed in the coffin in place of Nobunaga&#x27;s body, which could not be found. The ashes of the burned wooden statue were buried in place of Nobunaga&#x27;s body in the Bodaiji built at Daitoku-ji.

==Family==
Nobunaga first claimed that the Oda clan was descended from the Fujiwara clan, and later claimed descent from Taira no Sukemori of the Taira clan. According to the official genealogy of the Oda clan, after Taira no Sukemori was killed in the Battle of Dannoura in 1185, Taira no Chikazane, the son of Sukemori and a concubine, was entrusted to a Shinto priest at a Shinto Shrine in Otanosho in the Echizen province. This Chikazane became the founder of the Oda clan.

According to modern theories, there is no evidence that the Oda clan was descended from the Taira clan, and it is doubtful that they were really descended from the Taira clan, and there is a theory that they were actually descended from the Inbe clan, who were Shinto priests in Otanosho. One theory as to why Nobunaga came to claim descent from the Taira clan is that he justified his own seizure of power by exploiting . In other words, the idea was that the Minamoto clan, the shogun of the Kamakura shogunate, the Hōjō clan, descended from the Taira clan (&quot;Shikken&quot; of the Kamakura shogunate), the Ashikaga clan, descended from the Minamoto clan (shogun of the Ashikaga shogunate), and the Oda clan, descended from the Taira clan, were destined to seize power in that order.

However, there are theories that question whether the people of that time really believed in this idea, and whether the Hojo clan was really descended from the Taira clan.

===Immediate family===

===Other relatives===
One of Nobunaga&#x27;s younger sisters, Oichi, gave birth to three daughters. These three nieces of Nobunaga became involved with important historical figures. Chacha (also known as Lady Yodo), the eldest, became the mistress of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. O-Hatsu married Kyōgoku Takatsugu. The youngest, O-go, married the son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, Tokugawa Hidetada (the second shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate). O-go&#x27;s daughter Senhime married her cousin Toyotomi Hideyori, Lady Yodo&#x27;s son.

Nobunaga&#x27;s nephew was Tsuda Nobuzumi, the son of Nobuyuki. Nobuzumi married Akechi Mitsuhide&#x27;s daughter and was killed after the Honnō-ji coup by Nobunaga&#x27;s third son, Nobutaka, who suspected him of being involved in the plot.

===Later descendants===
Nobunaga&#x27;s granddaughter Oyu no Kata, by his son Oda Nobuyoshi, married Tokugawa Tadanaga.

Nobunari Oda, a retired figure skater, claims to be a 17th-generation direct descendant of Nobunaga, and the ex-monk celebrity Mudō Oda also claims descent from the Sengoku period warlord, but their claims have not been verified.

===Sword===
; Heshikiri Hasebe
: Famous sword by sword smith &#x27;Kunishige&#x27;. A Japanese national treasure. &#x27;Heshikiri&#x27; means press and cut and is said to derive from an anecdote about Nobunaga pressing and cutting a chabozu who had been rude to him, including the entire cupboard in which he hid.
; Yoshimoto Samonji
: A trophy from the Battle of Okehazama, which belonged to Imagawa Yoshimoto when he was killed. This sword was owned by Nobunaga, then passed to Hideyoshi and Ieyasu, and was called &#x27;the famous sword that ruled the whole country&#x27;.
; Yagen Tōshirō
: Matsunaga Hisahide donated it to Oda Nobunaga. It is said that it was burned down in the Honnō-ji Incident.
; Dōjigiri Yasutsuna sword
: Dōjigiri is one of the Five Swords under Heaven (天下五剣) made by Hōki Yasutsuna, this was the legendary sword with which Minamoto no Yorimitsu killed the boy-faced oni Shuten-dōji (酒呑童子) living near Mount Oe. It was presented to Oda Nobunaga by the Ashikaga family and was subsequently in the possession of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.
; Kotegiri Masamune sword
: means &quot; cutter&quot;. In this case is a contraction of (弓籠手), the arm guard used by a samurai archer. This name comes from an episode in which Asakura Ujikage cut an opposing samurai&#x27;s in the Battle of Toji in Kyoto. Oda Nobunaga gained possession of this sword and had it shortened to its present length.

<text>Otto Wilhelm Hermann Abich (11 December 18061 July 1886) was a German mineralogist and geologist who was among the first to conduct scientific studies in the Caucasus region and has been called the &quot;Father of Caucasian Geology&quot;. He worked briefly at the University of Dorpat and then travelled as part of the Corps of Mining Engineers of the Russian Empire. He collected minerals and fossils across the regions in which he travelled including Armenia, Persia, Italy and Daghestan.

==Biography==
Abich was the son of mining officer Heinrich Carl Wilhelm and his wife Johanna Wilhemine, daughter of the chemist Martin Klaproth. He was born in Berlin and initially went to study law at Heidelberg University but gave it up after two years and transferred to the natural sciences at Berlin university where his teachers included Alexander von Humboldt, Christian Leopold von Buch and Carl Ritter. He also studied philosophy under Georg Hegel and history under Leopold Ranke. His doctoral thesis in 1831 was in Latin. His earliest scientific work is related to spinels and other minerals. Following a recommendation by von Buch, he made special studies of fumaroles, of the mineral deposits around volcanic vents, and of the structure of volcanoes, travelling to Vesuvius, Aetna, Stromboli and Lipari around 1833-34. In 1842 he was appointed professor of mineralogy in the University of Dorpat (Tartu). He worked for the Russian Empire and became a member of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1853. His absence from Dorpat led to his being removed from the university add being placed in the Corps of Mining Engineers under M. S. Vorontsov. He travelled to the Caucasus, Daghestan, Armenia and northern Persia. Residing for some time at Tiflis, he investigated the geology of the Armenian Highland (this term was introduced by Abich) and Caucasus. In 1844 and 1845 he ascended Ararat volcano several times, studied the geological event of 1840 that was centered on Ararat (Akori village). He discovered some Miocene mammal fossils in Maragha. At the age of 50 he married Adelaide (Adele) daughter of chemist Hermann Heinrich Hess. In 1877 he retired to Vienna, where he published two volumes on his geological explorations in the Caucasus. He received the Constantine gold medal of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society for this, and a third volume was published posthumously, edited by Eduard Suess, with a biography. He died in Vienna from appendicitis and according to his wishes, he was cremated and the ashes buried in his mother&#x27;s grave in Koblenz. The mineral Abichite was named after him.

==Publications==
Abich published more than 190 papers. The following are some of the major writings, both book and papers in journals, of Abich:
* &quot;Vues illustratives de quelques phenomenes geologiques, prises sur le Vesuve et l&#x27;Etna, pendant les annees 1833 et 1834&quot; (Berlin, 1836);

<doc id="22685" wikidata="Q11315556" url="?curid=22685" title="Organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union">
<text>The organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was based on the principles of democratic centralism.

The governing body of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was the Party Congress, which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under Joseph Stalin (dominant from the late 1920s to 1953). Party Congresses would elect a Central Committee which, in turn, would elect a Politburo and a Secretariat. Under Stalin, the most powerful position in the party became the General Secretary, who was elected by the Politburo and Secretariat. In 1952 the &quot;Politburo&quot; became the &quot;Presidium&quot;.

In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin in January 1924, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary.

==Higher levels==
In the late Soviet Union the CPSU incorporated the communist parties of the 15 constituent republics (the communist branch of the Russian SFSR was established in 1990). Before 1990 the communist party organization in Russian oblasts, autonomous republics and some other major administrative units were subordinated directly to the CPSU Central Committee.

==Lower levels==
At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or partkoms (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected &quot;partkom bureau secretary&quot; (&quot;partkom secretary&quot;, секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, kolkhozes, etc., they were called as such, i.e., &quot;partkoms&quot;. At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: obkoms (обком) at oblast (zone) levels (known earlier as gubkoms (губком) for guberniyas), raikoms (райком) at raion (district) levels (known earlier as ukoms (уком) for uyezds), gorkom (горком) at city levels, etc.

The same terminology (&quot;raikom&quot;, etc.) was used in the organizational structure of Komsomol.

The bottom level of the Party was the primary party organization (первичная партийная организация) or party cell (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called party bureau/partbureau (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected bureau secretary (секретарь партбюро).

At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an exempt secretary, who drew his salary from the Party money.

==Main offices==

* General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union – became synonymous with leader of the Party under Joseph Stalin (General Secretary from 1922 to 1952)

<doc id="22686" wikidata="Q318674" url="?curid=22686" title="Oromo people">
<text>The Oromo people (, ; ) are a Cushitic ethnic group native to the Oromia region of Ethiopia and parts of Northern Kenya. They speak the Oromo language (also called &quot;Afaan Oromoo&quot;), which is part of the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. They are one of the largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia. According to the last Ethiopian census of 2007, the Oromo numbered 25,488,344 people or 34.5% of the Ethiopian population. Recent estimates have the Oromo comprising 45,000,000 people, or 35.8% of the total Ethiopian population estimated at 116,000,000.

The Oromo were originally nomadic, semi-pastoralist people who later would conquer large swaths of land during their expansions. After the settlement, they would establish kingdoms in the Gibe regions and dynasties in Abyssinia. The Oromo people traditionally used the &quot;gadaa&quot; system as the primary form of governance. A leader is elected by the &quot;gadaa&quot; system and their term lasts eight years, with an election taking place at the end of those eight years. Although most modern Oromos are Muslims or Christians, about 3% practice Waaqeffanna, the native ancient Cushitic monotheistic religion of Oromos.

==Origins and nomenclature==
Historical linguistics and comparative ethnology studies suggest that the Oromo people probably originated around the lakes Lake Chew Bahir and Lake Chamo. They are a Cushitic people and prior to their expansions, they inhabited only the region of what is now modern-day north Kenya and southern Ethiopia. The aftermath of the sixteenth century Ethiopian–Adal war led Oromos to move to the north. While Oromo people have lived in the region for a long time, the ethnic mixture of peoples who have lived here is unclear. The Oromos increased their numbers through assimilation (&quot;Meedhicca&quot;, &quot;Mogasa&quot; and &quot;Gudifacha&quot;), as well as the inclusion of mixed peoples (&quot;Gabbaro&quot;). The native names of the territories were replaced by the name of the Oromo clans who settled on it while the indigenous people were assimilated.

According to Herbert S. Lewis, both the Oromo and the Somali people originated in southern Ethiopia but the Somali expanded to the east and north much earlier than the Oromo, and the Oromo lived only in southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya until the Oromo expansion began about 1530. Historical evidence suggests that the Oromo people were already established in the southern highlands in or before the 15th century and that at least some Oromo people were interacting with other Ethiopian ethnic groups. According to Alessandro Triulzi, the interactions and encounters between Oromos and Nilo-Saharan groups likely began very early.

Subsequent colonial era documents mention and refer to the Oromo people as &quot;Galla&quot;, which has now developed derogatory connotations, but these documents were generally written by members of other ethnic groups. The term Galla was in use for Oromo people by the Abyssinians, Arabs, and Nilotic people. The original meaning of the term is heavily disputed. An outdated but popular theory among European historians during the 19th century regarding the origin of the term was the belief that it derives from the Hebrew (חלב) and Greek (Gála), &quot;milk&quot;, due to the outdated belief that the Oromos were lost white men. This name theory was especially popular among German historians who once believed that the Oromo were related to the ancient Gallic tribe in France. Another outdated theory of its origin comes from the belief that the Oromos rejected the offer to convert to Islam by Muhammad as their official religion, thus the prophet giving them the name Qal la or هو قال لا meaning &quot;he said no&quot;. Some sources claim it was a term for a river and a forest, as well as for the pastoral people established in the highlands of southern Ethiopia. This historical information, according to Mohammed Hassen, is consistent with the written and oral traditions of the Somalis. Others, such as the International African Institute, suggests that it is an Oromo word (adopted by neighbors), for there is a word, , meaning &#x27;wandering&#x27; or &#x27;to go home&#x27; in their language. Canadian philosophical professor, Claude Sumner, stated that the French explorer and Ethiopian traveler, Antoine Thomson d&#x27;Abbadie, claimed that the term had derived from an Oromo war cry whilst the Oromos were fighting on battlefields. The word Oromo is derived from meaning &#x27;[The] Children of Orma&#x27;, or &#x27;Sons of Men&#x27;. According to an alternative interpretation provided by Hugh Chisholm, &#x27;Ilm Orma&#x27; translates to &quot;son of a stranger.&quot; Both interpretations are noted in the Encyclopaedia Britannica Company.

==History==
The earliest recorded mention of the Oromos comes from the Italian (Venetian) cartographer Fra Mauro, who notes a &quot;Galla&quot; River south of the Awash River, in his famous &quot;Mappomondo&quot;, or map of the world, completed in 1460. This reference indicates that the Oromos inhabited this area of southern Ethiopia for at least a century and a half before their expansion north. As early as the 12th century, all aspects of Oromo life was governed by the &quot;Gadaa&quot; system, a political and ritual system based on an egalitarian ethos, age grade social organization and highly structured institutions. Under Gadaa, every eight years, the Oromo would choose by consensus nine leaders known as (the nine Borana assemblies). A leader elected by the gadaa system remains in power only for 8 years, with an election taking place at the end of those 8 years. Whenever an dies while exercising his functions, (the symbol of power) passes to his wife and she keeps the bokkuu and proclaims the laws.

The first detailed history of the Oromo people comes from the Ethiopian monk Bahrey who wrote &quot;Zenahu la Galla&quot;, or &quot;History of the Galla&quot; in 1593. They are also mentioned in the records left by Abba Paulos, Joao Bermudes, Jerónimo Lobo, Galawdewos, Sarsa Dengel and others. These records suggest that the Oromo were a pastoralist people who began to move in large numbers into the central highlands of Ethiopia from their cradleland in the plains of southern Ethiopia during the 16th century. This large scale expansion is referred to as the &quot;Great Oromo Migrations&quot;. Prior to this movement, the Oromos were divided into two major confederations, the &quot;Boorana&quot; and the &quot;Barento&quot;, who lived in the west and east of the Rift Valley respectively. The Barento moved in an eastern direction, eventually settling in today&#x27;s Arsi, Bale, Hararghe and Wollo regions. Whereas the Boorana trekked northwest, settling in the regions of Shewa, Illubabor and Welega.

According to Richard Pankhurst, a British-born Ethiopian historian, this expansion is linked to the attempted conquest of the Ethiopian Empire by Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim, which created a political and military vacuum that allowed the Oromo to move relatively unhindered into both the Ethiopian Empire and the Adal Sultanate. Further, they acquired horses and their system helped coordinate Oromo cavalry warriors which enabled them to fight very effectively. Bahrey argues the success of the Oromos in battle was because all Oromo men were trained as warriors, while in Ethiopia only a small section of the population were warriors, the rest uninvolved in the defense of their country. The military discipline of the Oromos was noted by the Portuguese chronicler Joao Bermudes, who observed that during the invasion of Dawaro, the Oromos &quot;did not come on without order like barbarians, but advanced collected in bodies, like squadrons.&quot;

The early 16th and 17th century witnessed the gradual integration of the Oromo into the Ethiopian Empire. Emperor Susenyos I, who came to power with Oromo support, did much to integrate them into the political establishment of the Christian state. Having grown up among the Oromo, he was fluent in their language and admired their way of life. He employed Oromo warriors, military tactics and combat formations against his rivals for the throne. Once in power, he filled high level offices with his Oromo supporters and settled various Oromo groups throughout much of Gojjam and Begemder. Under Susenyos&#x27;s successors, many Oromos would continue to rise to positions of prominence in imperial service, and for a period even change the official language of the empire from Amharic to Oromiffa during the rule of the half-Oromo emperor Iyoas I. They would establish dynasties such as the Yejju dynasty that would be de facto rulers of Ethiopian Empire from 1784 to 1853 during the Zemene Mesafint, they would particularly have control over the provinces of Begemder and Gojjam. Another Oromo dynasty that would rise in the northern Ethiopian highlands was the Islamic Warra Himano (1580–1916), which transformed Wollo into a veritable Islamic state in the heartland of Christian Ethiopia. The Warra Himano would convert many Amhara Christians to Islam during its rule, and at the zenith of its power, the Warra Himano had their hegemony accepted in the various parts of Wollo: Ambasel, Qallu, Borena, Wore-Illu and Amhara Sayint. Notable rulers such as Ras Mikael of Wollo and the uncrowned emperor of Ethiopia, Lij Iyasu (1913–1916), descend from this ruling family.

In the late 16th century the Oromos had settled in the territories south of the Abay river in western Ethiopia. Within 60 years of their arrival, five Oromo states would emerge in the Gibe region, such as Gera, Gomma, Gumma, Jimma and Limmu-Ennarea. These states arose through the transformation of pastoralism to agriculture due to the fertile and adequately watered land of the region. This increased the importance of agriculture and led to the subsequent rise of a land owning class. The rich natural environment produced commodities that were in high demand and lead to the rise of a strong merchant class. These changes allowed the gadaa officials to acquire more authority and convert their elective offices into permeant monarchical institutions. In the eastern part of the country, especially in Arsi, Bale and Hararghe, the Oromo had remained predominantly pastoralists until the late 19th century. Only the Oromo who lived within the immediate periphery of the city of Harar adopted agriculture as their primary occupation, mostly to engage in trade with the inhabitants of the walled city. According to oral and literary evidence, certain Somali and Oromo clans fought each other throughout the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly near their eastern borders.

The French traveler, Charles-Xavier Rochet d&#x27;Héricourt, visited Ethiopia in 1863, and was greeted by Sahle Selassie, the ruler of Shewa. During his time there, he observed the different ethnicities within Ethiopia, one of which were the Oromo people. He described them as such:
In the last quarter of the 19th century, the Oromo tribes and kingdoms fell under the rule of Menelik II of Shewa. Beginning in the 1870s, the Kingdom of Shewa annexed one Oromo territory after the other with unpreceded speed owing to the modern weapons acquired from the international arms trade and the disunity among various Oromo groups. The manner this conquest was carried out determined the form of administrations that was subsequently set up in the newly conquered areas. In areas where the Shewans encountered resistance, such as Arsi, the conquering generals were installed as governors and the Amhara soldiers or &quot;neftenya&quot; settled the region in military garrisons known as &quot;katamas&quot; which later become the administrative centers for Shewan rule. These officials and soldier-settlers lived off the land of the locals, who soon became serfs to the Shewan aristocrats. In the areas were the Oromos submitted peacefully, such as the Kingdom of Jimma, the indigenous rulers were made tributaries to the crown but were allowed to self-govern themselves with minimal interference from the central government. During Haile Selassie&#x27;s rule, many Oromos lost their autonomous status granted to them by Menelik, Haile Selassie abolished the semi-independent status of many Oromo states and began to undergo a period of centralization. Pastoralists were evicted to make way for mechanized farming and the few members of the educated Oromo class were prevented from holding powerful positions, instead being held by assimilated or Amharized Oromo notables. Despite the great contribution of the Oromo regions to the Ethiopian economy, Oromos areas were left out of the modernization projects during the reign of Haile Selassie.

This discontent emanating from the political marginalization, economic exploitation and the cultural domination of the Oromo led to the rise of the Mecha and Tulama Self-Help Association in 1963, ostensibly for organizing Oromo self-help, but in fact to promote Oromo identity and fight the marginalization of the Oromo. The Mecha and Tulama Association was soon disbanded by the government, but its impact was significant. The movement raised the consciousness of the Oromo regarding the significance of their own cultural and historical contributions and their status as a people within the Ethiopian state.

==Demographics==
The Oromos are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia (35.8% of the population), numbering about 40 million. They are predominantly concentrated in the Oromia Region in central Ethiopia, the largest region in the country by both population and area. They speak Afaan Oromoo, the official language of Oromia. Oromos constitute the third most populous ethnic group among Africans as a whole and the most populous among Horners specifically.

Oromo also have a notable presence in northern Kenya in the Marsabit County, Isiolo County and Tana River County totaling to about 656,636: 276,236 Borana, 141,200 Gabra, 158,000 Orma, 45,200 Sakuye, 20,000 Waata, and 16,000 Munyo Yaya. There are also Oromo in the former Wollo and Tigray provinces of Ethiopia.

===Subgroups===
The Oromo consist of two major branches that break down into an assortment of clan families. From west to east: the Borana Oromo, also called the &quot;Booranaa&quot;, are a semi-pastoralist group living in southern Oromia and northern Kenya. The Borana inhabit the Borena Zone of the Oromia Region of Ethiopia and the former Northern Frontier District (now northern Kenya) of Northern Kenya. They speak a dialect of Afaan Oromo, the Oromo language.
Barentu/Barentoo or (older) &quot;Baraytuma&quot; is the other moiety of the Oromo people. The Barentu Oromo inhabit the eastern parts of the Oromia Region in the Zones of West Hararghe, Arsi Zone, Bale Zone, Dire Dawa city, the Jijiga Zone of the Somali Region, Administrative Zone 3 of the Afar Region, Oromia Zone of the Amhara Region, and are also found in the Raya Azebo Aanaas in the Tigray Region.

==Language==
Oromo is written with Latin characters known as &quot;Qubee&quot;. The Sapalo script was invented by the Oromo scholar Sheikh Bakri Sapalo (also known by his birth name, Abubaker Usman Odaa) during the 1950s. Oromo serves as one of the official languages of Ethiopia and is also the working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system including Oromia, Harari and Dire Dawa regional states and of the Oromia Zone in the Amhara Region. It is a language of primary education in Oromia, Harari, Dire Dawa, Benishangul-Gumuz and of the Oromia Zone in the Amhara Region. It is used as an internet language for federal websites along with Tigrinya.

More than 35% of Ethiopia&#x27;s population are Oromo mother-tongue speakers, which makes it the most widely spoken primary language in Ethiopia. It is also the most widely spoken Cushitic language and the fourth-most widely spoken language of Africa, after Arabic, Hausa and Swahili. Oromo is spoken as a first language by more than 40 million Oromo people in Ethiopia and by an additional half-million in parts of northern and eastern Kenya. It is also spoken by smaller numbers of emigrants in other African countries, such as South Africa, Libya, Egypt and Sudan.
Besides first language speakers, a number of members of other ethnicities who are in contact with the Oromo speak it as a second language, such as the Omotic-speaking Bambassi and the Nilo-Saharan-speaking Kwama in western Ethiopia.

== Religion ==

The Oromo followed their traditional religion, Waaqeffanna, and were resistant to religious conversion before assimilation in sultanates and Christian kingdoms. The influential 30-year war from 1529 to 1559 between the three parties – the Oromo who followed Waaqeffanna, the Christians and the Muslims – dissipated the political strengths of all three. The religious beliefs of the Oromo people evolved in this socio-political environment. In the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, Protestant or Catholic missionaries&#x27; efforts spread Christianity among the Oromo. Organizations included the Sudan Interior Mission, the Bible Churchmen&#x27;s Missionary Society, the Seventh-Day Adventists, the United Presbyterian Mission of the US, the Church Mission to the Jews, Evangeliska Fosterlands-Stiftelsen, Bibeltrogna Vänner, and the Hermannsburg Mission.

In the mid and late 19th century, the Ethiopian emperors were faced with widespread rifts and disputes in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and crippling ethnic and religious divisions that plagued the empire and exposed it to the intervention and meddling of neighboring Muslims (especially Egypt and the Ottoman Empire) and European powers. The emperors that ruled in that period, Tewodros II, Yohannes IV, and Menelik II, thus strove to suppress disunion and schism both within and without the Ethiopian Church and were often intolerant towards other religions. The Wollo Oromo, the Arsi Oromo, and the Tulama Oromo were among those who violently clashed with the Ethiopian expansion in the region in the 19th century and the empire&#x27;s attempts at enforcing unity through the propagation of Orthodox Christianity, as the majority of these groups were not Christian but Muslims.

In the 2007 Ethiopian census for Oromia region, which included Oromo and some non-Oromo residents, there was a total of 13,107,963 followers of Christianity (8,204,908 Orthodox, 4,780,917 Protestant, 122,138 Catholic), 12,835,410 followers of Islam, 887,773 followers of traditional religions, and 162,787 followers of other religions. Accordingly, the Oromia region is approximately 40% to 45% Christian (8,204,908 or 30.4% Orthodox, 4,780,917 or 17.7% Protestant, 122,138 Catholic), 55% to 60% Muslim and 3.3% followers of traditional religions.

According to a 2016 estimate by James Minahan, about half of the Oromo people are Sunni Muslim, a third are Ethiopian Orthodox, and the rest are mostly Protestants or follow their traditional religious beliefs. The traditional religion is more common in southern Oromo populations and Christianity more common in and near the urban centers, while Islam is more common near the Somali border and in the north.

==Cuisine==
===Oromo dishes===
The Oromo cuisine consists of various vegetable and meat side dishes and entrées. Pork is typically not in Oromo cuisine, as it is considered taboo for Orthodox Oromos and Muslim Oromos who make up over 90% of the population combined, unlike with Catholics among others. Oromo people are believed to be one of the first to have cultivated coffee in Ethiopia and recognise its energizing effect.

==Culture==
=== Gadaa ===
Oromo people have governed themselves in accordance with the Gadaa system long before the 16th century. The system regulates the political, economic, social and religious activities of the community. Oromo were traditionally a culturally homogeneous society with genealogical ties. A male born in the Oromo clan went through five stages of eight years, where his life established his role and status for consideration to a &quot;Gadaa&quot; office. Every eight years, the Oromo would choose by consensus nine leaders for the office. A leader elected by the &quot;Gadaa&quot; system remains in power only for eight years, with an election taking place at the end of those eight years.

There are three &quot;Gadaa&quot; organs of governance: Gadaa Council, Gadaa General Assembly (), and the Qallu Assembly. The Gadaa Council is considered the collective achievement of the members of the Gadaa class. It is responsible for coordinating irreecha. The Gadaa General Assembly is the legislative body of the Gadaa government, while the Qallu Assembly is the religious institution.

===Calendar===

The Oromo people developed a lunisolar calendar; different geographically and religiously distinct Oromo communities use the same calendar. This calendar is sophisticated and similar to ones found among the Chinese, the Hindus and the Mayans. It was tied to the traditional religion of the Oromos, and used to schedule the &quot;Gadaa&quot; system of elections and power transfer.

The Borana Oromo calendar system was once thought to be based upon an earlier Cushitic calendar developed around 300 BC found at Namoratunga. Reconsideration of the Namoratunga site led astronomer and archaeologist Clive Ruggles to conclude that there is no relationship. The new year of the Oromo people, according to this calendar, falls in the month of October. The calendar has no weeks but a name for each day of the month. It is a lunar-stellar calendar system.

===Oromumma===
Some modern authors such as Gemetchu Megerssa have proposed the concept of , or &#x27;Oromoness&#x27; as a cultural common between Oromo people. The word is derived by combining &quot;Oromo&quot; with the Arabic term &quot;ummah&quot; (community). However, according to Terje Østebø and other scholars, this term is a neologism from the late 1990s and its link Oromo ethno-nationalism and Salafi Islamic discourse has been questioned, in their disagreement with Christian Amhara and other ethnic groups.

The Oromo people, depending on their geographical location and historical events, have variously converted to Islam, to Christianity, or remained with their traditional religion (Waaqeffanna). According to Gemetchu Megerssa, the subjective reality is that &quot;neither traditional Oromo rituals nor traditional Oromo beliefs function any longer as a cohesive and integral symbol system&quot; for the Oromo people, not just regionally but even locally. The cultural and ideological divergence within the Oromo people, in part from their religious differences, is apparent from the constant impetus for negotiations between broader Oromo spokespersons and those Oromo who are Ahl al-Sunna followers, states Terje Østebø. The internally evolving cultural differences within the Oromos have led some scholars such as Mario Aguilar and Abdullahi Shongolo to conclude that &quot;a common identity acknowledged by all Oromo in general does not exist&quot;.

===Social stratification===
Like other ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa and East Africa, Oromo people regionally developed social stratification consisting of four hierarchical strata. The highest strata were the nobles called the ; below them were the (some 17th- to 19th-century Ethiopian texts refer them as the ). Below these two upper castes were the despised castes of artisans, and at the lowest level were the slaves.

In the Islamic Kingdom of Jimma, the Oromo society&#x27;s caste strata predominantly consisted of endogamous, inherited artisanal occupations. Each caste group has specialized in a particular occupation such as iron working, carpentry, weapon making, pottery, weaving, leather-working and hunting.

Each caste in the Oromo society had a designated name. For example, were smiths, were potters, were tanners and leatherworkers, were weavers, were beekeepers and honey-makers, and were hunters and foragers. While slaves were a stratum within the society, many Oromos, regardless of caste, were sold into slavery elsewhere. By the 19th century, Oromo slaves were sought after and a major part of slaves sold in Gondar and Gallabat slave markets at Ethiopia-Sudan border, as well as the Massawa and Tajura markets on the Red Sea. There was also a large slave market at al Hudaydah on the coast of Yemen.

== Livelihood ==

The Oromo people are engaged in many occupations. The southern Oromo (specifically the Borana Oromo) are largely pastoralists who raise goats and cattle. Other Oromo groups have a more diverse economy which includes agriculture and work in urban centers. Some Oromo also sell many products and food items like coffee beans (coffee being a favorite beverage among the Oromo) at local markets.

==Contemporary era==
===Human rights issues===
In December 2009, a 96-page report titled &quot;Human Rights in Ethiopia: Through the Eyes of the Oromo Diaspora&quot;, compiled by the Advocates for Human Rights, documented human rights violations against the Oromo in Ethiopia under three successive regimes: the Ethiopian Empire under Haile Selassie, Marxist Derg and the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), dominated by members of the Tigrayan People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF) and which was accused to have arrested approximately 20,000 suspected OLF members, to have driven most OLF leadership into exile, and to have effectively neutralized the OLF as a political force in Ethiopia.

According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Oromia Support Group (OSG) recorded 594 extrajudicial killings of Oromos by Ethiopian government security forces and 43 disappearances in custody between 2005 and August 2008.

Starting in November 2015, during a wave of mass protests, mainly by Oromos, over the expansion of the municipal boundary of the city of Addis Ababa into Oromia, over 500 people have been killed and many more have been injured, according to human-rights advocates and independent monitors. The protests have since spread to other ethnic groups and encompass wider social grievances. Ethiopia declared a state of emergency in response to Oromo and Amhara protests in October 2016.

With the rising political unrest, there was ethnic violence involving the Oromo such as the Oromo–Somali clashes between the Oromo and the ethnic Somalis, leading to up to 400,000 displaced in 2017. Gedeo–Oromo clashes between the Oromo and the Gedeo people in the south of the country and continued violence in the Oromia-Somali border region led to Ethiopia having the largest number of people in the world fleeing their homes in 2018, with 1.4 million newly displaced people. In September 2018, in the minority protest that took place in Oromia near Addis Ababa, 23 people were killed following the deaths of 43 Oromos in the Addis Ababa neighborhood of Saris Abo. Some have blamed the rise in ethnic violence in the Oromia Special Zone Surrounding Finfinne on the Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for giving space to groups formerly banned by previous Tigrayan-led governments, such as the Oromo Liberation Front and Ginbot 7.

Protests broke out across Ethiopia, chiefly in the Oromia region, following the assassination of musician Hachalu Hundessa on 29 June 2020, leading to the deaths of at least 200 people. On 30 June 2020, a statue of former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie in London was destroyed by Oromo protestors in response to the killing of popular singer Hachalu Hundessa and grievances of the Oromo language being banned from education, and the use in administration under the Haile Selassie regime.

===Political organizations===
The Oromo have played a major role in the internal dynamics of Ethiopia. Accordingly, Oromos played major roles in all three main political movements in Ethiopia (centralist, federalist and secessionist) during the 19th and 20th century. In addition to holding high powers during the centralist government and the monarchy, the Raya Oromos in the Tigray regional state played a major role in the Weyane revolt, challenging Emperor Haile Selassie I &#x27;s rule in the 1940s. Simultaneously, both federalist and secessionist political forces developed inside the Oromo community.

At present a number of ethnic-based political organizations have been formed to promote the interests of the Oromo. The first was the Mecha and Tulama Self-Help Association was founded in January 1963, but was disbanded by the government after several increasingly tense confrontations in November 1966. Later groups include the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), Oromo Federalist Democratic Movement (OFDM), the United Liberation Forces of Oromia (ULFO), the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Oromia (IFLO), the Oromia Liberation Council (OLC), the Oromo National Congress (ONC, recently changed to OPC) and others. Another group, the Oromo People&#x27;s Democratic Organization (OPDO), is one of the four parties that form the ruling Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition. The ONC, for example, was part of the United Ethiopian Democratic Forces coalition that challenged the EPRDF in the Ethiopian general elections of 2005.

Several of these groups seek to create an independent Oromo nation, some using armed force. Meanwhile, the ruling OPDO and several opposition political parties in the Ethiopian parliament believe in ethnic federalism. However, most Oromo opposition parties in Ethiopia condemn the economic and political inequalities in the country. Progress toward independence started in the 1960s and 70s, but progress has been slow aside from the creation of Oromo-focused banks, notably the Oromo-owned Awash International Bank in 1994 and the Oromia Bank (formerly Oromia National Bank) established in 2008.

Radio broadcasts began in the Oromo language in Somalia in 1960 on Radio Mogadishu. Within Kenya there has been radio broadcasting in Oromo (in the Borana dialect) on the Voice of Kenya since at least the 1980s. Broadcasting in Oromo began in Ethiopia during the 1974 revolution, in which Radio Harar began broadcasting. The first private Afaan Oromoo newspaper in Ethiopia, &quot;Jimma Times&quot;, also known as , was recently established, but it has faced a lot of harassment and persecution from the Ethiopian government since its beginning. Abuse of Oromo media is widespread in Ethiopia and reflective of the general oppression Oromos face in the country.

Various human rights organizations have publicized the government persecution of Oromos in Ethiopia for decades. In 2008, the OFDM opposition party condemned the government&#x27;s indirect role in the death of hundreds of Oromos in western Ethiopia. According to Amnesty International, &quot;between 2011 and 2014, at least 5000 Oromos have been arrested based on their actual or suspected peaceful opposition to the government. These include thousands of peaceful protestors and hundreds of opposition political party members. The government anticipates a high level of opposition in Oromia, and signs of dissent are sought out and regularly, sometimes pre-emptively, suppressed. In numerous cases, actual or suspected dissenters have been detained without charge or trial, killed by security services during protests, arrests and in detention.&quot;

According to Amnesty International, there is a sweeping repression in the Oromo region of Ethiopia. On 12 December 2015, the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported violent protests in the Oromo region of Ethiopia in which more than 20 students were killed. According to the report, the students were protesting against the government&#x27;s re-zoning plan named &#x27;Addis Ababa Master Plan&#x27;.

On 2 October 2016, between 55 and 300 festival-goers were massacred at the most sacred and largest event among the Oromo, the Irreechaa cultural thanksgiving festival. In one day, dozens were killed and many injured. Every year, millions of Oromos gather in Bishoftu for this annual celebration. That year Ethiopian security forces responded to peaceful protests by firing tear gas and live bullets at over two million people surrounded by a lake and cliffs. In the week that followed, angry youth attacked government buildings and private businesses. On 8 October, the government responded with an abusive and far-reaching state of emergency, which was lifted in August 2017. During the state of emergency, security forces arbitrarily detained over 21,000 people.

<text>Oral history is the collection and study of historical information from
people, families, important events, or everyday life using audiotapes, videotapes, or transcriptions of planned interviews. These interviews are conducted with people who participated in or observed past events and whose memories and perceptions of these are to be preserved as an aural record for future generations. Oral history strives to obtain information from different perspectives and most of these cannot be found in written sources. &quot;Oral history&quot; also refers to information gathered in this manner and to a written work (published or unpublished) based on such data, often preserved in archives and large libraries. Knowledge presented by oral history is unique in that it shares the tacit perspective, thoughts, opinions and understanding of the interviewee in its primary form.

The term is sometimes used in a more general sense to refer to the study of information about past events that witnesses told anybody else, but professional historians usually consider this to be the study of oral tradition or &quot;traditional oral history&quot; due to the source receiving the information aurally.

== Overview ==
It is believed that the term &quot;oral history&quot; originates with Joe Gould, a homeless man living in New York City who solicited donations by claiming that he was working on a massive manuscript called &quot;An Oral History of Our Time&quot;, which he said consisted of thousands of recorded conversations on various topics. Although he was known to have a history of mental illness and violence, Gould was beloved by some writers in Greenwich Village, including Ezra Pound and E. E. Cummings. His writing, supposedly excerpts from this &quot;Oral History&quot;, was published in elite literary magazines, and he was eventually profiled in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Oral history has become an international movement in historical research. This is partly attributed to the development of information technology, which allowed a method rooted in orality to contribute to research, particularly the use of personal testimonies made in a wide variety of public settings. For instance, oral historians have discovered the endless possibilities of posting data and information on the Internet, making them readily available to scholars, teachers, and ordinary people. This reinforced the viability of oral history since the new modes of transmission allowed history to get off archival shelves and reach the larger community.

Oral historians in different countries have approached the collection, analysis, and dissemination of oral history in different modes. There are many ways of creating and studying oral histories even within individual national contexts.

According to the &quot;Columbia Encyclopedia&quot;:, the accessibility of tape recorders in the 1960s and 1970s led to oral documentation of the era&#x27;s movements and protests. Following this, oral history has increasingly become a respected record type. Some oral historians now also account for the subjective memories of interviewees due to the research of Italian historian Alessandro Portelli and his associates.

Oral histories are also used in many communities to document the experiences of survivors of tragedies. Following the Holocaust, there has emerged a rich tradition of oral history, particularly of Jewish survivors. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has an extensive archive of over 70,000 oral history interviews. There are also several organizations dedicated specifically to collecting and preserving oral histories of survivors. Oral history as a discipline has fairly low barriers to entry, so it is an act in which laypeople can readily participate. In his book Doing Oral History, Donald Ritchie wrote that &quot;oral history has room for both the academic and the layperson. With reasonable training... anyone can conduct a useable oral history.&quot; This is especially meaningful in cases like the Holocaust, where survivors may be less comfortable telling their story to a journalist than they would be to a historian or family member.

In the United States, there are several organizations dedicated to doing oral history which are not affiliated with universities or specific locations. StoryCorps is one of the most well-known of these: following the model of the Federal Writers’ Project created as part of the Works Progress Administration, StoryCorps’ mission is to record the stories of Americans from all walks of life. On contrast to the scholarly tradition of oral history, StoryCorps subjects are interviewed by people they know. There are a number of StoryCorps initiatives that have targeted specific populations or problems, following in the tradition of using oral history as a method to amplify voices that might otherwise be marginalized.

The development of digital databases with their text-search tools is one of the important aspects to the technology-based oral historiography. These made it easier to collect and disseminate oral history since access to millions of documents on national and international levels can be instantaneous.

== Growth and development ==

=== In Europe ===

==== Great Britain and Ireland ====
Since the early 1970s, oral history in Britain has grown from being a method in folklore studies (see for example the work of the School of Scottish Studies in the 1950s) to becoming a key component in community histories. Oral history continues to be an important means by which non-academics can actively participate in the compilation and study of history. Practitioners in a wide range of academic disciplines have also developed the method into a way of recording, understanding, and archiving narrated memories. Influences have included women&#x27;s history and labour history.

In Britain, the Oral History Society has played a key role in facilitating and developing the use of oral history.

A more complete account of the history of oral history in Britain and Northern Ireland can be found at &quot;Making Oral History&quot; on the Institute of Historical Research&#x27;s website.

The Bureau of Military History conducted over 1700 interviews with veterans of the First World War and Irish revolutionary period in Ireland. The documentation was released for research in 2003.

During 1998 and 1999, 40 BBC local radio stations recorded personal oral histories from a broad cross-section of the population for &quot;The Century Speaks&quot; series. The result was 640 half-hour radio documentaries, broadcast in the final weeks of the millennium, and one of the largest single oral history collections in Europe, the Millennium Memory Bank (MMB). The interview based recordings are held by the British Library Sound Archive in the oral history collection.

In one of the largest memory project anywhere, The BBC in 2003-6 invited its audiences to send in recollections of the homefront in the Second World War. It put 47,000 of the recollections online, along with 15,000 photographs.

=== In Italy ===
Alessandro Portelli is an Italian oral historian. He is known for his work which compared workers&#x27; experiences in Harlan County, Kentucky and Terni, Italy. Other oral historians have drawn on Portelli&#x27;s analysis of memory, identity, and the construction of history.

=== In post-Soviet/Eastern bloc states ===

==== Belarus ====
, since the government-run historiography in modern Belarus almost fully excludes repression during the epoch when Belarus was part of the Soviet Union, only private initiatives cover the oral memories of the Belarusians. Citizens&#x27; groups in Belarus use the methods of oral history and record narrative interviews on video; the Virtual Museum of Soviet Repression in Belarus presents a full virtual museum with intense use of oral history.

==== Czech Republic ====
Czech oral history began to develop beginning in the 1980s with a focus on social movements and political activism. The practice of oral history and any attempts to document stories prior to this is fairly unknown. The practice of oral history began to take shape in the 1990s. In 2000, The Oral History Center (COH) at the Institute of Contemporary History, Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic (AV ČR) was established with the aim of &quot;systematically support the development of oral history methodology and its application in historical research&quot;.

In 2001, Post Bellum, a nonprofit organization, was established to &quot;documents the memories of witnesses of the important historical phenomenons of the 20th century&quot; within the Czech Republic and surrounding European countries. Post Bellum works in partnership with Czech Radio and Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes. Their oral history project &quot;Memory of Nation&quot; was created in 2008 and interviews are archived online for user access. As of January 2015, the project has more than 2100 published witness accounts in several languages, with more than 24,000 pictures.

Other projects, including articles and books have been funded by the Czech Science Foundation (AV ČR) including:
* &quot;Students in the Period of the Fall of Communism – Life Stories&quot; published as the book &quot;One Hundred Student Revolutions&quot; (1999) by M. Vaněk and M. Otáhal;
* &quot;Political Elites and Dissidents during the Period of So-called Normalization – Historical Interviews&quot; which resulted in &quot;Victors? Vanquished&quot; (2005), a two-volume collection of 50 interviews;
* A compilation of original interpretive essays entitled &quot;The Powerful?! or Helpless?!&quot;
* &quot;An Investigation into Czech Society during the &#x27;Normalization&#x27; Era: Biographic Narratives of Workers and the Intelligentsia&quot; and
* A book of interpretations called &quot;Ordinary People...?!&quot; (2009).
These publications aim to demonstrate that oral history contributes to the understanding of human lives and history itself, such as the motives behind the dissidents&#x27; activities, the formation of opposition groups, communication between dissidents and state representatives and the emergence of ex-communist elites and their decision-making processes.

Oral history centers in the Czech Republic emphasize educational activities (seminars, lectures, conferences), archiving and maintaining interview collections, and providing consultations to those interested in the method.

=== In Spain ===
Because of repression in Francoist Spain (1939–75), the development of oral history in Spain was quite limited until the 1970s. It became well-developed in the early 1980s, and often had a focus on the Civil War years (1936–39), especially regarding the ones who lost the war and whose stories had been suppressed. At the University of Barcelona, Professor Mercedes Vilanova was a leading scholar, who combined oral history with her interest in quantification and social history. Barcelona scholars sought to integrate oral sources with traditional written sources to create mainstream, not ghettoized, historical interpretations. They sought to give a public voice to neglected groups, such as women, illiterates, political leftists, and ethnic minorities. In 1987, at Universidade De Santiago de Compostela, Marc Wouters and Isaura Varela started an oral history project focused on the Spanish Civil War, exile, and migration. The project explored victims of the war and the Francoist Dictatorship and includes 2100 interviews and 800 hours of audio.

=== In the United States ===
Oral history began with a focus on national leaders in the United States, but has expanded to include groups representing the entire population. In Britain, the influence of &#x27;history from below&#x27; and interviewing people who had been &#x27;hidden from history&#x27; was more influential. In both countries, elite oral history has emerged as an important strand. Scientists, for example, have been covered in numerous oral history projects. Doel (2003) discusses the use of oral interviews by scholars as primary sources, He lists major oral history projects in the history of science begun after 1950. Oral histories, he concludes, can augment the biographies of scientists and help spotlight how their social origins influenced their research. Doel acknowledges the common concerns historians have regarding the validity of oral history accounts. He identifies studies that used oral histories successfully to provide critical and unique insight into otherwise obscure subjects, such as the role scientists played in shaping US policy after World War II. Interviews furthermore can provide road maps for researching archives, and can even serve as a fail-safe resource when written documents have been lost or destroyed. Roger D. Launius (2003) shows the huge size and complexity of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) oral history program since 1959. NASA systematically documented its operations through oral histories. They can help to explore broader issues regarding the evolution of a major federal agency. The collection consists primarily of oral histories conducted by scholars working on books about the agency. Since 1996, it has included oral histories of senior NASA administrators and officials, astronauts, and project managers, part of a broader project to document the lives of key agents. Launius emphasizes efforts to include such less-well-known groups within the agency as the Astrobiology Program, and to collect the oral histories of women in NASA.

==== Folklore roots and ordinary people ====
Contemporary oral history involves recording or transcribing eyewitness accounts of historical events. Some anthropologists started collecting recordings (at first especially of Native American folklore) on phonograph cylinders in the late 19th century. In the 1930s, the Federal Writers&#x27; Project—part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA)—sent out interviewers to collect accounts from various groups, including surviving witnesses of the Civil War, slavery, and other major historical events. The Library of Congress also began recording traditional American music and folklore onto acetate discs. With the development of audio tape recordings after World War II, the task of oral historians became easier.

In 1946, David P. Boder, a professor of psychology at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, traveled to Europe to record long interviews with &quot;displaced persons&quot;—most of them Holocaust survivors. Using the first device capable of capturing hours of audio—the wire recorder—Boder came back with the first recorded Holocaust testimonials and in all likelihood the first recorded oral histories of significant length.

Over some forty years, Fran Leeper Buss interviewed marginalized women such as Jesusita Aragon, a traditionally trained midwife, and Maria Elena Lucas a migrant farm worker activist, using transcripts of the interviews to write their life stories.

Many state and local historical societies have oral history programs. Sinclair Kopp (2002) reported on the Oregon Historical Society&#x27;s program. It began in 1976 with the hiring of Charles Digregorio, who had studied at Columbia with Nevins. Thousands of sound recordings, reel-to-reel tapes, transcriptions, and radio broadcasts have made it one of the largest collections of oral history on the Pacific Coast. In addition to political figures and prominent businessmen, the Oregon Historical Society has done interviews with minorities, women, farmers, and other ordinary citizens, who have contributed extraordinary stories reflecting the state&#x27;s cultural and social heritage. Hill (2004) encourages oral history projects in high school courses. She demonstrates a lesson plan that encourages the study of local community history through interviews. By studying grassroots activism and the lived experiences of its participants, her high school students came to appreciate how African Americans worked to end Jim Crow laws in the 1950s.

Mark D. Naison (2005) describes the Bronx African American History Project (BAAHP), an oral community history project developed by the Bronx County Historical Society. Its goal was to document the histories of black working- and middle-class residents of the South Bronx neighborhood of Morrisania in New York City since the 1940s.

=== In Asia ===

==== Syria ====
Katharina Lange studied the tribal histories of Syria. The oral histories in this area could not be transposed into tangible, written form due to their positionalities, which Lange describes as &quot;taking sides&quot;. The positionality of oral history could lead to conflict and tension. The tribal histories are typically narrated by men. While histories are also told by women, they are not accepted locally as &quot;real history&quot;. Oral histories often detail the lives and feats of ancestors.

Genealogy is a prominent subject in the area. According to Lange, the oral historians often tell their own personalized genealogies to demonstrate their credibility, both in their social standing and their expertise in the field.

==== Palestine ====
Oral sources have established themselves as a vital, diverse, and adaptable source of information for the study of Palestinian history. Researchers benefited from the material contributions of oral studies to studies examining a wide range of topics, including folktales, food and clothing, linguistics and toponymy, genealogy, agricultural activities, and religious cult. Furthermore, due to the dearth of extant indigenous documentation, oral histories continue to play a crucial role in Palestinian academics&#x27; continuous efforts to narrate significant moments in Palestine&#x27;s history. Researchers engaged in a flurry of methodological discussions as Palestinian oral history research reached its zenith in the latter quarter of the 20th century. Some of these researchers published their recommendations in manuals specifically designed to standardize and inform oral history research within the Palestinian context.

Notable Palestinian oral history projects include the American University of Beirut&#x27;s Palestinian Oral History Archive (POHA), and the Palestinian Oral History Map, Columbia University&#x27;s Oral History Project in New York, Duke University&#x27;s Palestinian Oral History Project, the Palestinian Rural History Project (PRHP), Palestine Remembered, and Zochrot.

==== China ====
The rise of oral history is a new trend in historical studies in China that began in the late twentieth century. Some oral historians, stress the collection of eyewitness accounts of the words and deeds of important historical figures and what really happened during those important historical events, which is similar to common practice in the west, while the others focus more on important people and event, asking important figures to describe the decision making and details of important historical events. In December 2004, the Chinese Association of Oral History Studies was established. The establishment of this institution is thought to signal that the field of oral history studies in China has finally moved into a new phase of organized development.

==== Uzbekistan ====
From 2003 to 2004, Professors Marianne Kamp and Russell Zanca researched agricultural collectivization in Uzbekistan in part by using oral history methodology to fill in gaps in information missing from the Central State Archive of Uzbekistan. The goal of the project was to learn more about life in the 1920s and 1930s to study the impact of the Soviet Union&#x27;s conquest. 20 interviews each were conducted in the Fergana valley, Tashkent, Bukhara, Khorezm, and Kashkadarya regions. Their interviews uncovered stories of famine and death that had not been widely known outside of local memory in the region.

==== Southeast Asia ====
While oral tradition is an integral part of ancient Southeast Asian history, oral history is a relatively recent development. Since the 1960s, oral history has been accorded increasing attention on institutional and individual levels, representing &quot;history from above&quot; and &quot;history from below&quot;.

In Oral History and Public Memories, Blackburn writes about oral history as a tool that was used &quot;by political elites and state-run institutions to contribute to the goal of national building&quot; in postcolonial Southeast Asian countries. Blackburn draws most of his examples of oral history as a vehicle for &quot;history from above&quot; from Malaysia and Singapore.

In terms of &quot;history from below&quot;, various oral history initiatives are being undertaken in Cambodia in an effort to record lived experiences from the rule of the Khmer Rouge regime while survivors are still living. These initiative take advantage of crowdsourced history to uncover the silences imposed on the oppressed.

==== South Asia ====
Two prominent and ongoing oral history projects out of South Asia stem from time periods of ethnic violence that were decades apart: 1947 and 1984.

The 1947 Partition Archive was founded in 2010 by Guneeta Singe Bhalla, a physicist in Berkeley, California, who began conducting and recording interviews &quot;to collect and preserve the stories of those who lived through this tumultuous time, to make sure this great human tragedy isn&#x27;t forgotten&quot;. 

The Sikh Diaspora Project was founded in 2014 by Brajesh Samarth, senior lecturer in Hindi-Urdu at Emory University in Atlanta, when he was a lecturer at Stanford University in California. The project focuses on interviews with members of the Sikh diaspora in the U.S. and Canada, including the many who migrated after the 1984 massacre of Sikhs in India.

=== In Oceania ===

==== Australia ====
Hazel de Berg began recording Australian writers, artists, musicians and others in the Arts community in 1957. She conducted nearly 1300 interviews. Together with the National Library of Australia, she was a pioneer in the field in Australia, working together for twenty-seven years.

In December 1997, in response to the first recommendation of the &quot;Bringing Them Home: Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families&quot; report, the Australian Government announced funding for the National Library to develop and manage an oral history project. The Bringing Them Home Oral History Project (1998–2002) collected and preserved the stories of Indigenous Australians and others involved in or affected by the child removals resulting in the Stolen Generations. Other contributors included missionaries, police and government administrators.

There are now many organisations and projects all over Australia involved in recording oral histories from Australians of all ethnicities and in all walks of life.

In 1948, Allan Nevins, a Columbia University historian, established the Columbia Oral History Research Office, now known as the Columbia Center for Oral History Research, with a mission of recording, transcribing, and preserving oral history interviews. The Regional Oral History Office was founded in 1954 as a division of the University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Bancroft Library. In 1967, American oral historians founded the Oral History Association, and British oral historians founded the Oral History Society in 1969. In 1981, Mansel G. Blackford, a business historian at Ohio State University, argued that oral history was a useful tool to write the history of corporate mergers. More recently, Harvard Business School launched the Creating Emerging Markets project, which &quot;explores the evolution of business leadership in Africa, Asia, and Latin America throughout recent decades&quot; through oral history. &quot;At its core are interviews, many on video, by the School&#x27;s faculty with leaders or former leaders of firms and NGOs who have had a major impact on their societies and enterprises across three continents.&quot; There are now numerous national organizations and an International Oral History Association, which hold workshops and conferences and publish newsletters and journals devoted to oral history theory and practices. Specialized collections of oral history sometimes have archives of widespread global interest; an example is the Lewis Walpole Library in Farmington, Connecticut, a department of the University Library of Yale.

== Methods ==

Historians, folklorists, anthropologists, human geographers, sociologists, journalists, linguists, and many others employ some form of interviewing in their research. Although multi-disciplinary, oral historians have promoted common ethics and standards of practice, most importantly the attaining of the &quot;informed consent&quot; of those being interviewed. Usually this is achieved through a deed of gift, which also establishes copyright ownership that is critical for publication and archival preservation.

Oral historians generally prefer to ask open-ended questions and avoid leading questions that encourage people to say what they think the interviewer wants them to say. Some interviews are &quot;life reviews&quot;, conducted with people at the end of their careers. Other interviews focus on a specific period or a specific event in people&#x27;s lives, such as in the case of war veterans or survivors of a hurricane.

Feldstein (2004) considers oral history to be akin to journalism, Both are committed to uncovering truths and compiling narratives about people, places, and events. Felstein says each could benefit from adopting techniques from the other. Journalism could benefit by emulating the exhaustive and nuanced research methodologies used by oral historians. The practice of oral historians could be enhanced by utilizing the more sophisticated interviewing techniques employed by journalists, in particular, the use of adversarial encounters as a tactic for obtaining information from a respondent.

The first oral history archives focused on interviews with prominent politicians, diplomats, military officers, and business leaders. By the 1960s and &#x27;70s, influenced by the rise of new social history, interviewing began to be employed more often when historians investigated history from below. Whatever the field or focus of a project, oral historians attempt to record the memories of many different people when researching a given event. Interviewing a single person provides a single perspective. People misremember events or distort their accounts for various reasons. By interviewing widely, oral historians seek points of agreement among many different sources, and also record the complexity of the issues. The nature of memories is as much a part of the practice of oral history as are the stories collected.

== Archaeology ==
Archaeologists sometimes conduct oral history interviews to learn more about unknown artifacts. Oral interviews can provide narratives, social meaning, and contexts for objects. When describing the use of oral histories in archaeological work, Paul Mullins emphasizes the importance of using these interviews to replace &quot;it-narratives&quot;. It-narratives are the voices from objects themselves rather than people; according to Mullins, these lead to narratives that are often &quot;sober, pessimistic, or even dystopian&quot;.

Oral history interviews were used to provide context and social meaning in the Overstone excavation project in Northumberland. Overstone consists of a row of four cottages. The excavation team, consisting of Jane Webster, Louise Tolson, Richard Carlton, and volunteers, found the discovered artifacts difficult to identify. The team first took the artifacts to an archaeology group, but the only person with knowledge about a found fragment recognized the fragment from a type of pot her mother had. This inspired the team to conduct group interviews volunteers who grew up in households using such objects. The team took their reference collection of artifacts to the interviews in order to trigger the memories of volunteers, revealing a &quot;shared cultural identity&quot;.

== Legal interpretations ==
In 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada, in the &quot;Delgamuukw v. British Columbia&quot; trial, ruled that, in the context of &quot;Aboriginal title&quot; claims, oral histories were just as important as written testimony.

Writers who use oral history have often discussed its relationship to historical truth. Gilda O&#x27;Neill writes in &quot;Lost Voices&quot;, an oral history of East End hop-pickers: &quot;I began to worry. Were the women&#x27;s, and my, memories true or were they just stories? I realised that I had no &#x27;innocent&#x27; sources of evidence – facts. I had, instead, the stories and their tellers&#x27; reasons for remembering in their own particular ways.&#x27; Duncan Barrett, one of the co-authors of &quot;The Sugar Girls&quot; describes some of the perils of relying on oral history accounts: &quot;On two occasions, it became clear that a subject was trying to mislead us about what happened – telling a self-deprecating story in one interview, and then presenting a different, and more flattering, version of events when we tried to follow it up. ... often our interviewees were keen to persuade us of a certain interpretation of the past, supporting broad, sweeping comments about historical change with specific stories from their lives.&quot; Alessandro Portelli argues that oral history is valuable nevertheless: &quot;it tells us less about events as such than about their meaning [...] the unique and precious element which oral sources force upon the historian ... is the speaker&#x27;s subjectivity.&quot;

Regarding the accuracy of oral history, Jean-Loup Gassend concludes in the book &quot;Autopsy of a Battle&quot;, &quot;I found that each witness account can be broken down into two parts: 1) descriptions of events that the witness participated in directly, and 2) descriptions of events that the witness did not actually participate in, but that he heard about from other sources. The distinction between these two parts of a witness account is of the highest importance. I noted that concerning events that the witnesses participated in, the information provided was surprisingly reliable, as was confirmed by comparison with other sources. The imprecision or mistakes usually concerned numbers, ranks, and dates, the first two tending to become inflated with time. Concerning events that the witness had not participated in personally, the information was only as reliable as whatever the source of information had been (various rumors); that is to say, it was often very unreliable and I usually discarded such information.&quot;

In 2006, American historian Caroline Elkins published &quot;Imperial Reckoning: The Untold Story of Britain&#x27;s Gulag in Kenya&quot;, detailing the Mau Mau Uprising against British rule and its suppression by the colonial government. The work received both praise and criticism over its usage of oral testimony from Kenyans. Three years later in 2009, a group of Kenyans who had been interned in concentration camps during the rebellion by the colonial authorities filed a lawsuit against the British government. The case, known as &quot;Mutua and Five Others versus the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&quot;, was heard at the High Court of Justice in London with the Honourable Justice McCombe presiding. Oral testimony detailing abuses by colonial officials, recorded by Elkins in &quot;Imperial Reckoning&quot;, was cited as evidence by the prosecution during the case, British lawyer Martyn Day and the Kenya Human Rights Commission. During the trial, over the course of discovery the FCO discovered some 300 boxes of previously undisclosed files that validated Elkins&#x27; claims in &quot;Imperial Reckoning&quot; and provided new evidence supporting the claimants&#x27; case. McCombe eventually ruled in the Kenyan claimants&#x27; favor, stressing the &quot;substantial documentation supporting accusations of systematic abuses&quot;.

== Pros and cons ==
When using oral history as a source material, several caveats exist. The person being interviewed may not accurately recall factual information such as names or dates, and they may exaggerate. To avoid this, interviewers can do thorough research prior to the interview and formulate questions for the purpose of clarification. There also exists a pre-conceived notion that oral history is less reliable than written records. Written source materials are different in the execution of information, and that they may have additional sources. Oral sources identify intangibles such as atmosphere, insights into character, and clarifications to points made briefly in print. Oral history can also indicate lifestyle, dialect and terminology, and customs that may no longer be prominent. Oral history can be used academically to trigger independent contextualisation and independent research regarding views expressed by interviewees. Successful oral history enhances its written counterpart.

Other concerns that scholars point to include the fact that the data collected in the form of oral histories is difficult to quantify, can reflect the researchers’ biases towards their object of study, and are open to many interpretations.

In addition, older male speakers from rural communities who have spent their whole life there and who usually did not continue education past age 14 are proportionally overrepresented in some oral history material.

== Transcription ==
Transcribing the data obtained is obviously beneficial and the intentions for future use of transcripts largely determine the way in which the interview will be transcribed. As oral history projects as a rule do not involve the employment of a professional transcriber, &quot;aberrant&quot; characteristics such as dialectal features and superfluous repetitions may be neutralized and eliminated so as to make transcripts more accessible to average readers who are not accustomed to such &quot;aberrations&quot;; that is to say, transcripts may be not completely reflective of the original, actual utterances of the interviewees.

== Controversies ==
In Guatemalan literature, &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchú&quot; (1983), brings oral history into the written form through the &quot;testimonio&quot; genre. &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchú&quot; is compiled by Venezuelan anthropologist Burgos-Debray, based on a series of interviews she conducted with Menchú. The Menchú-controversy arose when historian David Stoll took issue with Menchú&#x27;s claim that &quot;this is a story of all poor Guatemalans&quot;. In &quot;Rigoberta Menchú and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans&quot; (1999), Stoll argues that the details in Menchú&#x27;s &quot;testimonio&quot; are inconsistent with his own fieldwork and interviews he conducted with other Mayas. According to Guatemalan novelist and critic Arturo Arias, this controversy highlights a tension in oral history. On one hand, it presents an opportunity to convert the subaltern subject into a &quot;speaking subject&quot;. On the other hand, it challenges the historical profession in certifying the &quot;factuality of her mediated discourse&quot; as &quot;subaltern subjects are forced to [translate across epistemological and linguistic frameworks and] use the discourse of the colonizer to express their subjectivity&quot;.

<text>An oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. In tumor cells, these genes are often mutated, or expressed at high levels.

Most normal cells undergo a preprogrammed rapid cell death (apoptosis) if critical functions are altered and then malfunction. Activated oncogenes can cause those cells designated for apoptosis to survive and proliferate instead. Most oncogenes began as proto-oncogenes: normal genes involved in cell growth and proliferation or inhibition of apoptosis. If, through mutation, normal genes promoting cellular growth are up-regulated (gain-of-function mutation), they predispose the cell to cancer and are termed &quot;oncogenes&quot;. Usually, multiple oncogenes, along with mutated apoptotic or tumor suppressor genes, act in concert to cause cancer. Since the 1970s, dozens of oncogenes have been identified in human cancer. Many cancer drugs target the proteins encoded by oncogenes. Oncogenes are a physically and functionally diverse set of genes, and as a result, their protein products have pleiotropic effects on a variety of intricate regulatory cascades within the cell.

Genes known as proto-oncogenes are those that normally encourage cell growth and division in order to generate new cells or sustain the viability of pre-existing cells. When overexpressed, proto-oncogenes can be inadvertently activated (turned on), which changes them to oncogenes.

There are numerous ways to activate (turn on) oncogenes in cells:

Gene changes or mutations: A person&#x27;s genetic &quot;coding&quot; may differ in a way that causes an oncogene to always be activated. These types of gene changes can develop spontaneously throughout the course of a person&#x27;s life or they might be inherited from a parent when a transcription error occurs during cell division.

Cells can frequently switch genes on or off via epigenetic mechanisms rather than actual genetic alterations. Alternately, different chemical compounds that can be linked to genetic material (DNA or RNA) may have an impact on which genes are active. An oncogene may sporadically become activated due to these epigenetic modifications. Visit Gene Alterations and Cancer to learn more about epigenetic alterations.

Chromosomal rearrangement: Every living creature has chromosomes, which are substantial strands of DNA that contain the genes for a cell. A chromosome&#x27;s DNA sequence may alter each time a cell divides. This could cause a gene to be located near to a proto-oncogene that acts as an &quot;on&quot; switch, keeping it active even when it shouldn&#x27;t. The cell can develop irregularly with the aid of this new oncogene.

Gene duplication: If one cell has more copies of a gene than another, that cell may produce too much of a certain protein.

The first human oncogene (HRAS), a crucial finding in the field of cancer research, was discovered more than 40 years ago, and since then, the number of novel pathogenic oncogenes has increased steadily. The discovery of specific small-molecule inhibitors that specifically target the different oncogenic proteins and a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of the ways in which oncogenes dysregulate physiological signaling to cause different cancer types and developmental syndromes are potential future advances in the field of cancer research. Investigating the quickly expanding field of oncogene molecular research, the goal of this special issue was to generate practical translational indicators that could be able to meet clinical needs.

Genes that are considered crucial for cancer can be divided into two categories based on whether the harmful mutations in them result in function loss or gain. Gain-of-function mutations of proto-oncogenes drive cells to proliferate when they shouldn&#x27;t, while loss-of-function mutations of tumor suppressor genes free cells from inhibitions that typically serve to control their numbers. The ability of the mutant genes, known as oncogenes, to steer a specific line of test cells toward malignant proliferation can occasionally be used to identify these later mutations, which have a dominating effect.

Many of them were initially found to induce cancer in animals when they are introduced through viral vector infection, which carries genetic information from a prior host cell. Another method for identifying oncogenes is to look for genes that are activated by mutations in human cancer cells or by chromosomal translocations that may indicate the presence of a gene that is crucial for cancer.

Cancer patients are generally categorized according to clinical parameters in order to tailor their cancer therapy. For example, the separation of patients with acute leukemia into those with lymphocytic leukemia and those with myelocytic leukemia is important, because the optimal treatment for each form is different. Even in a particular disease, the identification of patients with good and poor prognostic potential is helpful, since more aggressive therapy may be needed to achieve a cure in the poor prognostic group. Oncogenes are prognostic markers in certain human cancers. N-myc amplification is an independent determinant in predicting a poor outcome in childhood neuroblastoma. Those children with amplification of N-myc, regardless of stage, will have shortened survival. Thus, therapeutic efforts are concentrated on intensifying treatment in this poor prognostic group.

==History==
The theory of oncogenes was foreshadowed by the German biologist Theodor Boveri in his 1914 book &quot;Zur Frage der Entstehung Maligner Tumoren&quot; (Concerning the Origin of Malignant Tumors) in which he predicted the existence of oncogenes &quot;(Teilungsfoerdernde Chromosomen)&quot; that become amplified &quot;(im permanenten Übergewicht)&quot; during tumor development.

Later on, the term &quot;oncogene&quot; was rediscovered in 1969 by National Cancer Institute scientists George Todaro and Robert Huebner.

The first confirmed oncogene was discovered in 1970 and was termed SRC (pronounced &quot;sarc&quot; as it is short for sarcoma). SRC was first discovered as an oncogene in a chicken retrovirus. Experiments performed by Dr. G. Steve Martin of the University of California, Berkeley demonstrated that SRC was indeed the gene of the virus that acted as an oncogene upon infection. The first nucleotide sequence of v-Src was sequenced in 1980 by A.P. Czernilofsky et al.

In 1976, Drs. , J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus of the University of California, San Francisco demonstrated that oncogenes were activated proto-oncogenes as is found in many organisms, including humans. Bishop and Varmus were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1989 for their discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes.

Dr. Robert Weinberg is credited with discovering the first identified human oncogene in a human bladder cancer cell line. The molecular nature of the mutation leading to oncogenesis was subsequently isolated and characterized by the Spanish biochemist Mariano Barbacid and published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1982. Dr. Barbacid spent the following months extending his research, eventually discovering that the oncogene was a mutated allele of HRAS and characterizing its activation mechanism.

The resultant protein encoded by an oncogene is termed oncoprotein. Oncogenes play an important role in the regulation or synthesis of proteins linked to tumorigenic cell growth. Some oncoproteins are accepted and used as tumor markers.

== Proto-oncogene ==
A proto-oncogene is a normal gene that could become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate the cell growth and differentiation. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals, usually through their protein products. Upon acquiring an activating mutation, a proto-oncogene becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene. Examples of proto-oncogenes include RAS, WNT, MYC, ERK, and TRK. The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma, which starts when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence within the vicinity of the MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors. When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr-Abl gene found on the Philadelphia chromosome, a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22. Bcr-Abl codes for a tyrosine kinase, which is constitutively active, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. (More information about the Philadelphia Chromosome below)

=== Activation ===

The proto-oncogene can become an oncogene by a relatively small modification of its original function. There are three basic methods of activation:
#A mutation within a proto-oncogene, or within a regulatory region (for example the promoter region), can cause a change in the protein structure, causing
#* an increase in protein (enzyme) activity
#* a loss of regulation
# An increase in the amount of a certain protein (protein concentration), caused by
#* an increase of protein expression (through misregulation)
#* an increase of protein (mRNA) stability, prolonging its existence and thus its activity in the cell
#* gene duplication (one type of chromosome abnormality), resulting in an increased amount of protein in the cell
# A chromosomal translocation (another type of chromosome abnormality)
#*There are 2 different types of chromosomal translocations that can occur:
##translocation events which relocate a proto-oncogene to a new chromosomal site that leads to higher expression
##translocation events that lead to a fusion between a proto-oncogene and a 2nd gene (this creates a fusion protein with increased cancerous/oncogenic activity)
##* the expression of a constitutively active &quot;hybrid protein&quot;. This type of mutation in a dividing stem cell in the bone marrow leads to adult leukemia
##*Philadelphia Chromosome is an example of this type of translocation event. This chromosome was discovered in 1960 by Peter Nowell and David Hungerford, and it is a fusion of parts of DNA from chromosome 22 and chromosome 9. The broken end of chromosome 22 contains the &quot;BCR&quot; gene, which fuses with a fragment of chromosome 9 that contains the &quot;ABL1&quot; gene. When these two chromosome fragments fuse the genes also fuse creating a new gene: &quot;BCR-ABL&quot;. This fused gene encodes for a protein that displays high protein tyrosine kinase activity (this activity is due to the &quot;ABL1&quot; half of the protein). The unregulated expression of this protein activates other proteins that are involved in cell cycle and cell division which can cause a cell to grow and divide uncontrollably (the cell becomes cancerous). As a result, the Philadelphia Chromosome is associated with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (as mentioned before) as well as other forms of Leukemia.

The expression of oncogenes can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs 21-25 nucleotides in length that control gene expression by downregulating them. Mutations in such microRNAs (known as oncomirs) can lead to activation of oncogenes. Antisense messenger RNAs could theoretically be used to block the effects of oncogenes.

==Classification==
There are several systems for classifying oncogenes, but there is not yet a widely accepted standard. They are sometimes grouped both spatially (moving from outside the cell inwards) and chronologically (parallelling the &quot;normal&quot; process of signal transduction). There are several categories that are commonly used:

Additional oncogenetic regulator properties include:
::*Growth factors are usually secreted by either specialized or non-specialized cells to induce cell proliferation in themselves, nearby cells, or distant cells. An oncogene may cause a cell to secrete growth factors even though it does not normally do so. It will thereby induce its own uncontrolled proliferation (&quot;autocrine loop&quot;), and proliferation of neighboring cells, possibly leading to tumor formation. It may also cause production of growth hormones in other parts of the body.
::*Receptor tyrosine kinases add phosphate groups to other proteins in order to turn them on or off. Receptor kinases add phosphate groups to receptor proteins at the surface of the cell (which receives protein signals from outside the cell and transmits them to the inside of the cell). Tyrosine kinases add phosphate groups to the amino acid tyrosine in the target protein. They can cause cancer by turning the receptor permanently on (constitutively), even without signals from outside the cell.
::*Ras is a small GTPase that hydrolyses GTP into GDP and phosphate. Ras is activated by growth factor signaling (i.e., EGF, TGFbeta) and acting as a binary switch (on/off) in growth signaling pathways. Downstream effectors of Ras include three mitogen-activated protein kinases Raf a MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase (MAPKKK), MEK a MAP Kinase Kinase (MAPKK), and ERK a MAP Kinase(MAPK), which in turn regulate genes that mediate cell proliferation.

<text>In telecommunications, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a type of digital transmission used in digital modulation for encoding digital (binary) data on multiple carrier frequencies. OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for wideband digital communication, used in applications such as digital television and audio broadcasting, DSL internet access, wireless networks, power line networks, and 4G/5G mobile communications.

OFDM is a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme that was introduced by Robert W. Chang of Bell Labs in 1966. In OFDM, the incoming bitstream representing the data to be sent is divided into multiple streams. Multiple closely spaced orthogonal subcarrier signals with overlapping spectra are transmitted, with each carrier modulated with bits from the incoming stream so multiple bits are being transmitted in parallel. Demodulation is based on fast Fourier transform algorithms. OFDM was improved by Weinstein and Ebert in 1971 with the introduction of a guard interval, providing better orthogonality in transmission channels affected by multipath propagation. Each subcarrier (signal) is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme (such as quadrature amplitude modulation or phase-shift keying) at a low symbol rate. This maintains total data rates similar to conventional single-carrier modulation schemes in the same bandwidth.

The main advantage of OFDM over single-carrier schemes is its ability to cope with severe channel conditions (for example, attenuation of high frequencies in a long copper wire, narrowband interference and frequency-selective fading due to multipath) without the need for complex equalization filters. Channel equalization is simplified because OFDM may be viewed as using many slowly modulated narrowband signals rather than one rapidly modulated wideband signal. The low symbol rate makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable, making it possible to eliminate intersymbol interference (ISI) and use echoes and time-spreading (in analog television visible as ghosting and blurring, respectively) to achieve a diversity gain, i.e. a signal-to-noise ratio improvement. This mechanism also facilitates the design of single frequency networks (SFNs) where several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency, as the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be re-combined constructively, sparing interference of a traditional single-carrier system.

In coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (COFDM), forward error correction (convolutional coding) and time/frequency interleaving are applied to the signal being transmitted. This is done to overcome errors in mobile communication channels affected by multipath propagation and Doppler effects. COFDM was introduced by Alard in 1986 for Digital Audio Broadcasting for Eureka Project 147. In practice, OFDM has become used in combination with such coding and interleaving, so that the terms COFDM and OFDM co-apply to common applications.

== Characteristics and principles of operation ==

=== Orthogonality ===
Conceptually, OFDM is a specialized frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) method, with the additional constraint that all subcarrier signals within a communication channel are orthogonal to one another.

In OFDM, the subcarrier frequencies are chosen so that the subcarriers are orthogonal to each other, meaning that crosstalk between the sub-channels is eliminated and inter-carrier guard bands are not required. This greatly simplifies the design of both the transmitter and the receiver; unlike conventional FDM, a separate filter for each sub-channel is not required.

The orthogonality requires that the subcarrier spacing is formula_1 Hertz, where &quot;T&quot;U seconds is the useful symbol duration (the receiver-side window size), and &quot;k&quot; is a positive integer, typically equal to 1. This stipulates that each carrier frequency undergoes &quot;k&quot; more complete cycles per symbol period than the previous carrier. Therefore, with &quot;N&quot; subcarriers, the total passband bandwidth will be &quot;B&quot; ≈ &quot;N&quot;·Δ&quot;f&quot; (Hz).

The orthogonality also allows high spectral efficiency, with a total symbol rate near the Nyquist rate for the equivalent baseband signal (i.e., near half the Nyquist rate for the double-side band physical passband signal). Almost the whole available frequency band can be used. OFDM generally has a nearly &#x27;white&#x27; spectrum, giving it benign electromagnetic interference properties with respect to other co-channel users.

:A simple example: A useful symbol duration &quot;T&quot;U = 1 ms would require a subcarrier spacing of formula_2 (or an integer multiple of that) for orthogonality. &quot;N&quot; = 1,000 subcarriers would result in a total passband bandwidth of &quot;N&quot;Δf = 1 MHz. For this symbol time, the required bandwidth in theory according to Nyquist is formula_3 (half of the achieved bandwidth required by our scheme), where &quot;R&quot; is the bit rate and where &quot;N&quot; = 1,000 samples per symbol by FFT. If a guard interval is applied (see below), Nyquist bandwidth requirement would be even lower. The FFT would result in &quot;N&quot; = 1,000 samples per symbol. If no guard interval was applied, this would result in a base band complex valued signal with a sample rate of 1 MHz, which would require a baseband bandwidth of 0.5 MHz according to Nyquist. However, the passband RF signal is produced by multiplying the baseband signal with a carrier waveform (i.e., double-sideband quadrature amplitude-modulation) resulting in a passband bandwidth of 1 MHz. A single-side band (SSB) or vestigial sideband (VSB) modulation scheme would achieve almost half that bandwidth for the same symbol rate (i.e., twice as high spectral efficiency for the same symbol alphabet length). It is however more sensitive to multipath interference.

OFDM requires very accurate frequency synchronization between the receiver and the transmitter; with frequency deviation the subcarriers will no longer be orthogonal, causing &quot;inter-carrier interference&quot; (ICI) (i.e., cross-talk between the subcarriers). Frequency offsets are typically caused by mismatched transmitter and receiver oscillators, or by Doppler shift due to movement. While Doppler shift alone may be compensated for by the receiver, the situation is worsened when combined with multipath, as reflections will appear at various frequency offsets, which is much harder to correct. This effect typically worsens as speed increases, and is an important factor limiting the use of OFDM in high-speed vehicles. In order to mitigate ICI in such scenarios, one can shape each subcarrier in order to minimize the interference resulting in a non-orthogonal subcarriers overlapping. For example, a low-complexity scheme referred to as WCP-OFDM (&quot;Weighted Cyclic Prefix Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing&quot;) consists of using short filters at the transmitter output in order to perform a potentially non-rectangular pulse shaping and a near perfect reconstruction using a single-tap per subcarrier equalization. Other ICI suppression techniques usually drastically increase the receiver complexity.

===Implementation using the FFT algorithm===
The orthogonality allows for efficient modulator and demodulator implementation using the FFT algorithm on the receiver side, and inverse FFT on the sender side. Although the principles and some of the benefits have been known since the 1960s, OFDM is popular for wideband communications today by way of low-cost digital signal processing components that can efficiently calculate the FFT.

The time to compute the inverse-FFT or FFT has to take less than the time for each symbol, which for example for DVB-T means the computation has to be done in or less.

For an -point FFT this may be approximated to:

:formula_4
* MIPS: Million instructions per second

The computational demand approximately scales linearly with FFT size so a double size FFT needs double the amount of time and vice versa. As a comparison an Intel Pentium III CPU at 1.266 GHz is able to calculate a FFT in using FFTW. Intel Pentium M at 1.6 GHz does it in Intel Core Duo at 3.0 GHz does it in .

=== Guard interval for elimination of intersymbol interference ===
One key principle of OFDM is that since low symbol rate modulation schemes (i.e., where the symbols are relatively long compared to the channel time characteristics) suffer less from intersymbol interference caused by multipath propagation, it is advantageous to transmit a number of low-rate streams in parallel instead of a single high-rate stream. Since the duration of each symbol is long, it is feasible to insert a guard interval between the OFDM symbols, thus eliminating the intersymbol interference.

The guard interval also eliminates the need for a pulse-shaping filter, and it reduces the sensitivity to time synchronization problems.

:A simple example: If one sends a million symbols per second using conventional single-carrier modulation over a wireless channel, then the duration of each symbol would be one microsecond or less. This imposes severe constraints on synchronization and necessitates the removal of multipath interference. If the same million symbols per second are spread among one thousand sub-channels, the duration of each symbol can be longer by a factor of a thousand (i.e., one millisecond) for orthogonality with approximately the same bandwidth. Assume that a guard interval of 1/8 of the symbol length is inserted between each symbol. Intersymbol interference can be avoided if the multipath time-spreading (the time between the reception of the first and the last echo) is shorter than the guard interval (i.e., 125 microseconds). This corresponds to a maximum difference of 37.5 kilometers between the lengths of the paths.

The cyclic prefix, which is transmitted during the guard interval, consists of the end of the OFDM symbol copied into the guard interval, and the guard interval is transmitted followed by the OFDM symbol. The reason that the guard interval consists of a copy of the end of the OFDM symbol is so that the receiver will integrate over an integer number of sinusoid cycles for each of the multipaths when it performs OFDM demodulation with the FFT.
In some standards such as Ultrawideband, in the interest of transmitted power, cyclic prefix is skipped and nothing is sent during the guard interval. The receiver will then have to mimic the cyclic prefix functionality by copying the end part of the OFDM symbol and adding it to the beginning portion.

=== Simplified equalization ===
The effects of frequency-selective channel conditions, for example fading caused by multipath propagation, can be considered as constant (flat) over an OFDM sub-channel if the sub-channel is sufficiently narrow-banded (i.e., if the number of sub-channels is sufficiently large). This makes frequency domain equalization possible at the receiver, which is far simpler than the time-domain equalization used in conventional single-carrier modulation. In OFDM, the equalizer only has to multiply each detected subcarrier (each Fourier coefficient) in each OFDM symbol by a constant complex number, or a rarely changed value. On a fundamental level, simpler digital equalizers are better because they require fewer operations, which translates to fewer round-off errors in the equalizer. Those round-off errors can be viewed as numerical noise and are inevitable.

:Our example: The OFDM equalization in the above numerical example would require one complex valued multiplication per subcarrier and symbol (i.e., formula_5 complex multiplications per OFDM symbol; i.e., one million multiplications per second, at the receiver). The FFT algorithm requires formula_6 [this is imprecise: over half of these complex multiplications are trivial, i.e. = to 1 and are not implemented in software or HW]. complex-valued multiplications per OFDM symbol (i.e., 10 million multiplications per second), at both the receiver and transmitter side. This should be compared with the corresponding one million symbols/second single-carrier modulation case mentioned in the example, where the equalization of 125 microseconds time-spreading using a FIR filter would require, in a naive implementation, 125 multiplications per symbol (i.e., 125 million multiplications per second). FFT techniques can be used to reduce the number of multiplications for an FIR filter-based time-domain equalizer to a number comparable with OFDM, at the cost of delay between reception and decoding which also becomes comparable with OFDM.

If differential modulation such as DPSK or DQPSK is applied to each subcarrier, equalization can be completely omitted, since these non-coherent schemes are insensitive to slowly changing amplitude and phase distortion.

In a sense, improvements in FIR equalization using FFTs or partial FFTs leads mathematically closer to OFDM, but the OFDM technique is easier to understand and implement, and the sub-channels can be independently adapted in other ways than varying equalization coefficients, such as switching between different QAM constellation patterns and error-correction schemes to match individual sub-channel noise and interference characteristics.

Some of the subcarriers in some of the OFDM symbols may carry pilot signals for measurement of the channel conditions (i.e., the equalizer gain and phase shift for each subcarrier). Pilot signals and training symbols (preambles) may also be used for time synchronization (to avoid intersymbol interference, ISI) and frequency synchronization (to avoid inter-carrier interference, ICI, caused by Doppler shift).

OFDM was initially used for wired and stationary wireless communications. However, with an increasing number of applications operating in highly mobile environments, the effect of dispersive fading caused by a combination of multi-path propagation and doppler shift is more significant. Over the last decade, research has been done on how to equalize OFDM transmission over doubly selective channels.

=== Channel coding and interleaving ===
OFDM is invariably used in conjunction with channel coding (forward error correction), and almost always uses frequency and/or time interleaving.

Frequency (subcarrier) interleaving increases resistance to frequency-selective channel conditions such as fading. For example, when a part of the channel bandwidth fades, frequency interleaving ensures that the bit errors that would result from those subcarriers in the faded part of the bandwidth are spread out in the bit-stream rather than being concentrated. Similarly, time interleaving ensures that bits that are originally close together in the bit-stream are transmitted far apart in time, thus mitigating against severe fading as would happen when travelling at high speed.

However, time interleaving is of little benefit in slowly fading channels, such as for stationary reception, and frequency interleaving offers little to no benefit for narrowband channels that suffer from flat-fading (where the whole channel bandwidth fades at the same time).

The reason why interleaving is used on OFDM is to attempt to spread the errors out in the bit-stream that is presented to the error correction decoder, because when such decoders are presented with a high concentration of errors the decoder is unable to correct all the bit errors, and a burst of uncorrected errors occurs. A similar design of audio data encoding makes compact disc (CD) playback robust.

A classical type of error correction coding used with OFDM-based systems is convolutional coding, often concatenated with Reed-Solomon coding. Usually, additional interleaving (on top of the time and frequency interleaving mentioned above) in between the two layers of coding is implemented. The choice for Reed-Solomon coding as the outer error correction code is based on the observation that the Viterbi decoder used for inner convolutional decoding produces short error bursts when there is a high concentration of errors, and Reed-Solomon codes are inherently well suited to correcting bursts of errors.

Newer systems, however, usually now adopt near-optimal types of error correction codes that use the turbo decoding principle, where the decoder iterates towards the desired solution. Examples of such error correction coding types include turbo codes and LDPC codes, which perform close to the Shannon limit for the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Some systems that have implemented these codes have concatenated them with either Reed-Solomon (for example on the MediaFLO system) or BCH codes (on the DVB-S2 system) to improve upon an error floor inherent to these codes at high signal-to-noise ratios.

The resilience to severe channel conditions can be further enhanced if information about the channel is sent over a return-channel. Based on this feedback information, adaptive modulation, channel coding and power allocation may be applied across all subcarriers, or individually to each subcarrier. In the latter case, if a particular range of frequencies suffers from interference or attenuation, the carriers within that range can be disabled or made to run slower by applying more robust modulation or error coding to those subcarriers.

The term (DMT) denotes OFDM-based communication systems that adapt the transmission to the channel conditions individually for each subcarrier, by means of so-called &quot;bit-loading&quot;. Examples are ADSL and VDSL.

The upstream and downstream speeds can be varied by allocating either more or fewer carriers for each purpose. Some forms of rate-adaptive DSL use this feature in real time, so that the bitrate is adapted to the co-channel interference and bandwidth is allocated to whichever subscriber needs it most.

=== OFDM extended with multiple access ===

OFDM in its primary form is considered as a digital modulation technique, and not a multi-user channel access method, since it is used for transferring one bit stream over one communication channel using one sequence of OFDM symbols. However, OFDM can be combined with multiple access using time, frequency or coding separation of the users.

In orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), frequency-division multiple access is achieved by assigning different OFDM sub-channels to different users. OFDMA supports differentiated quality of service by assigning different number of subcarriers to different users in a similar fashion as in CDMA, and thus complex packet scheduling or medium access control schemes can be avoided. OFDMA is used in:
* the mobility mode of the IEEE 802.16 Wireless MAN standard, commonly referred to as WiMAX,
* the IEEE 802.20 mobile Wireless MAN standard, commonly referred to as MBWA,
* the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) fourth generation mobile broadband standard downlink. The radio interface was formerly named High Speed OFDM Packet Access (HSOPA), now named Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA).
* the 3GPP 5G NR (New Radio) fifth generation mobile network standard downlink and uplink. 5G NR is the successor to LTE. 
* the now defunct Qualcomm/3GPP2 Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB) project, intended as a successor of CDMA2000, but replaced by LTE.
OFDMA is also a candidate access method for the IEEE 802.22 &quot;Wireless Regional Area Networks&quot; (WRAN). The project aims at designing the first cognitive radio-based standard operating in the VHF-low UHF spectrum (TV spectrum).
* the most recent amendment of 802.11 standard, namely 802.11ax, includes OFDMA for high efficiency and simultaneous communication.

In multi-carrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA), also known as OFDM-CDMA, OFDM is combined with CDMA spread spectrum communication for coding separation of the users. Co-channel interference can be mitigated, meaning that manual fixed channel allocation (FCA) frequency planning is simplified, or complex dynamic channel allocation (DCA) schemes are avoided.

=== Space diversity ===
In OFDM-based wide-area broadcasting, receivers can benefit from receiving signals from several spatially dispersed transmitters simultaneously, since transmitters will only destructively interfere with each other on a limited number of subcarriers, whereas in general they will actually reinforce coverage over a wide area. This is very beneficial in many countries, as it permits the operation of national single-frequency networks (SFN), where many transmitters send the same signal simultaneously over the same channel frequency. SFNs use the available spectrum more effectively than conventional multi-frequency broadcast networks (MFN), where program content is replicated on different carrier frequencies. SFNs also result in a diversity gain in receivers situated midway between the transmitters. The coverage area is increased and the outage probability decreased in comparison to an MFN, due to increased received signal strength averaged over all subcarriers.

Although the guard interval only contains redundant data, which means that it reduces the capacity, some OFDM-based systems, such as some of the broadcasting systems, deliberately use a long guard interval in order to allow the transmitters to be spaced farther apart in an SFN, and longer guard intervals allow larger SFN cell-sizes. A rule of thumb for the maximum distance between transmitters in an SFN is equal to the distance a signal travels during the guard interval — for instance, a guard interval of 200 microseconds would allow transmitters to be spaced 60 km apart.

A &quot;single frequency network&quot; is a form of transmitter macrodiversity. The concept can be further used in &quot;dynamic single-frequency networks&quot; (DSFN), where the SFN grouping is changed from timeslot to timeslot.

OFDM may be combined with other forms of space diversity, for example antenna arrays and MIMO channels. This is done in the IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN standards.

=== Linear transmitter power amplifier ===
An OFDM signal exhibits a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) because the independent phases of the subcarriers mean that they will often combine constructively. Handling this high PAPR requires:
* A high-resolution digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in the transmitter
* A high-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in the receiver
* A linear signal chain

Any non-linearity in the signal chain will cause intermodulation distortion that
* Raises the noise floor
* May cause inter-carrier interference
* Generates out-of-band spurious radiation

The linearity requirement is demanding, especially for transmitter RF output circuitry where amplifiers are often designed to be non-linear in order to minimise power consumption. In practical OFDM systems a small amount of peak clipping is allowed to limit the PAPR in a judicious trade-off against the above consequences. However, the transmitter output filter which is required to reduce out-of-band spurs to legal levels has the effect of restoring peak levels that were clipped, so clipping is not an effective way to reduce PAPR.

Although the spectral efficiency of OFDM is attractive for both terrestrial and space communications, the high PAPR requirements have so far limited OFDM applications to terrestrial systems.

The crest factor CF (in dB) for an OFDM system with &quot;n&quot; uncorrelated subcarriers is

:formula_7

where CFc is the crest factor (in dB) for each subcarrier.
(CFc is 3.01 dB for the sine waves used for BPSK and QPSK modulation).

For example, the DVB-T signal in 2K mode is composed of 1705 subcarriers that are each QPSK-modulated, giving a crest factor of 35.32 dB.

Many PAPR (or crest factor) reduction techniques have been developed, for instance, based on iterative clipping.
Over the years, numerous model-driven approaches have been proposed to reduce the PAPR in communication systems. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring data-driven models for PAPR reduction as part of ongoing research in end-to-end communication networks. These data-driven models offer innovative solutions and new avenues of exploration to address the challenges posed by high PAPR effectively. By leveraging data-driven techniques, researchers aim to enhance the performance and efficiency of communication networks by optimizing power utilization.

The dynamic range required for an FM receiver is while DAB only require about As a comparison, each extra bit per sample increases the dynamic range by 

== Efficiency comparison between single carrier and multicarrier ==
The performance of any communication system can be measured in terms of its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency. The power efficiency describes the ability of communication system to preserve bit error rate (BER) of the transmitted signal at low power levels. Bandwidth efficiency reflects how efficiently the allocated bandwidth is used and is defined as the throughput data rate per hertz in a given bandwidth. If the large number of subcarriers are used, the bandwidth efficiency of multicarrier system such as OFDM with using optical fiber channel is defined as
: formula_8

where formula_9 is the symbol rate in giga-symbols per second (Gsps), formula_10 is the bandwidth of OFDM signal, and the factor of 2 is due to the two polarization states in the fiber.

There is saving of bandwidth by using multicarrier modulation with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing. So the bandwidth for multicarrier system is less in comparison with single carrier system and hence bandwidth efficiency of multicarrier system is larger than single carrier system.
There is only 1dB increase in receiver power, but we get 76.7% improvement in bandwidth efficiency with using multicarrier transmission technique.

== Idealized system model ==
This section describes a simple idealized OFDM system model suitable for a time-invariant AWGN channel.

=== Transmitter ===
An OFDM carrier signal is the sum of a number of orthogonal subcarriers, with baseband data on each subcarrier being independently modulated commonly using some type of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or phase-shift keying (PSK). This composite baseband signal is typically used to modulate a main RF carrier.

formula_11 is a serial stream of binary digits. By inverse multiplexing, these are first demultiplexed into formula_12 parallel streams, and each one mapped to a (possibly complex) symbol stream using some modulation constellation (QAM, PSK, etc.). Note that the constellations may be different, so some streams may carry a higher bit-rate than others.

An inverse FFT is computed on each set of symbols, giving a set of complex time-domain samples. These samples are then quadrature-mixed to passband in the standard way. The real and imaginary components are first converted to the analogue domain using digital-to-analogue converters (DACs); the analogue signals are then used to modulate cosine and sine waves at the carrier frequency, formula_13, respectively. These signals are then summed to give the transmission signal, formula_14.

=== Receiver ===
The receiver picks up the signal formula_15, which is then quadrature-mixed down to baseband using cosine and sine waves at the carrier frequency. This also creates signals centered on formula_16, so low-pass filters are used to reject these. The baseband signals are then sampled and digitised using analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and a forward FFT is used to convert back to the frequency domain.

This returns formula_12 parallel streams, each of which is converted to a binary stream using an appropriate symbol detector. These streams are then re-combined into a serial stream, formula_18, which is an estimate of the original binary stream at the transmitter.

==Mathematical description==

If formula_12 subcarriers are used, and each subcarrier is modulated using formula_20 alternative symbols, the OFDM symbol alphabet consists of formula_21 combined symbols.

The low-pass equivalent OFDM filter is expressed as:
:formula_22
where formula_23 are the data symbols, formula_12 is the number of subcarriers, and formula_25 is the OFDM symbol time. The subcarrier spacing of formula_26 makes them orthogonal over each symbol period; this property is expressed as:
:formula_27

where formula_28 denotes the complex conjugate operator and formula_29 is the Kronecker delta.

To avoid intersymbol interference in multipath fading channels, a guard interval of length formula_30 is inserted prior to the OFDM block. During this interval, a &quot;cyclic prefix&quot; is transmitted such that the signal in the interval formula_31 equals the signal in the interval formula_32. The OFDM signal with cyclic prefix is thus:
:formula_33

The low-pass signal filter above can be either real or complex-valued. Real-valued low-pass equivalent signals are typically transmitted at baseband—wireline applications such as DSL use this approach. For wireless applications, the low-pass signal is typically complex-valued; in which case, the transmitted signal is up-converted to a carrier frequency formula_13. In general, the transmitted signal can be represented as:
:formula_35

===OFDM system comparison table===
Key features of some common OFDM-based systems are presented in the following table.
===ADSL===
OFDM is used in ADSL connections that follow the ANSI T1.413 and G.dmt (ITU G.992.1) standards, where it is called &quot;discrete multitone modulation&quot; (DMT). DSL achieves high-speed data connections on existing copper wires. OFDM is also used in the successor standards ADSL2, ADSL2+, VDSL, VDSL2, and G.fast. ADSL2 uses variable subcarrier modulation, ranging from BPSK to 32768QAM (in ADSL terminology this is referred to as bit-loading, or bit per tone, 1 to 15 bits per subcarrier).

Long copper wires suffer from attenuation at high frequencies. The fact that OFDM can cope with this frequency selective attenuation and with narrow-band interference are the main reasons it is frequently used in applications such as ADSL modems.

===Powerline Technology===
OFDM is used by many powerline devices to extend digital connections through power wiring. Adaptive modulation is particularly important with such a noisy channel as electrical wiring. Some medium speed smart metering modems, &quot;Prime&quot; and &quot;G3&quot; use OFDM at modest frequencies (30–100 kHz) with modest numbers of channels (several hundred) in order to overcome the intersymbol interference in the power line environment.
The IEEE 1901 standards include two incompatible physical layers that both use OFDM. The ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables) is based on a PHY layer that specifies OFDM with adaptive modulation and a Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) FEC code.

===Wireless local area networks (LAN) and metropolitan area networks (MAN)===
OFDM is extensively used in wireless LAN and MAN applications, including IEEE 802.11a/g/n and WiMAX.

IEEE 802.11a/g/n, operating in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, specifies per-stream airside data rates ranging from 6 to 54 Mbit/s. If both devices can use &quot;HT mode&quot; (added with 802.11n), the top 20 MHz per-stream rate is increased to 72.2 Mbit/s, with the option of data rates between 13.5 and 150 Mbit/s using a 40 MHz channel. Four different modulation schemes are used: BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM, along with a set of error correcting rates (1/2–5/6). The multitude of choices allows the system to adapt the optimum data rate for the current signal conditions.

===Wireless personal area networks (PAN)===
OFDM is also now being used in the WiMedia/Ecma-368 standard for high-speed wireless personal area networks in the 3.1–10.6 GHz ultrawideband spectrum (see MultiBand-OFDM).

=== Terrestrial digital radio and television broadcasting ===
Much of Europe and Asia has adopted OFDM for terrestrial broadcasting of digital television (DVB-T, DVB-H and T-DMB) and radio (EUREKA 147 DAB, Digital Radio Mondiale, HD Radio and T-DMB).

==== DVB-T ====
By Directive of the European Commission, all television services transmitted to viewers in the European Community must use a transmission system that has been standardized by a recognized European standardization body, and such a standard has been developed and codified by the DVB Project, &quot;Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Framing structure, channel coding and modulation for digital terrestrial television&quot;. Customarily referred to as DVB-T, the standard calls for the exclusive use of COFDM for modulation. DVB-T is now widely used in Europe and elsewhere for terrestrial digital TV.

==== SDARS ====
The ground segments of the Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS) systems used by XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio are transmitted using Coded OFDM (COFDM). The word &quot;coded&quot; comes from the use of forward error correction (FEC).

==== COFDM vs VSB ====

The question of the relative technical merits of COFDM versus 8VSB for terrestrial digital television has been a subject of some controversy, especially between European and North American technologists and regulators. The United States has rejected several proposals to adopt the COFDM-based DVB-T system for its digital television services, and for many years has opted to use 8VSB (vestigial sideband modulation) exclusively for terrestrial digital television. However, in November 2017, the FCC approved a voluntary transition to ATSC 3.0, a new broadcast standard which is based on COFDM. Unlike the first digital television transition in America, TV stations will not be assigned separate frequencies to transmit ATSC 3.0 and are not required to switch to ATSC 3.0 by any deadline. Televisions sold in the U.S. are also not required to include ATSC 3.0 tuning capabilities. Full-powered television stations are permitted to make the switch to ATSC 3.0, as long as they continue to make their main channel available through a simulcast agreement with another in-market station (with a similar coverage area) through at least November 2022.

One of the major benefits provided by COFDM is in rendering radio broadcasts relatively immune to multipath distortion and signal fading due to atmospheric conditions or passing aircraft. Proponents of COFDM argue it resists multipath far better than 8VSB. Early 8VSB DTV (digital television) receivers often had difficulty receiving a signal. Also, COFDM allows single-frequency networks, which is not possible with 8VSB.

However, newer 8VSB receivers are far better at dealing with multipath, hence the difference in performance may diminish with advances in equalizer design.

====Digital radio====

COFDM is also used for other radio standards, for Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), the standard for digital audio broadcasting at VHF frequencies, for Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), the standard for digital broadcasting at shortwave and medium wave frequencies (below 30 MHz) and for DRM+ a more recently introduced standard for digital audio broadcasting at VHF frequencies. (30 to 174 MHz)

The United States again uses an alternate standard, a proprietary system developed by iBiquity dubbed &quot;HD Radio&quot;. However, it uses COFDM as the underlying broadcast technology to add digital audio to AM (medium wave) and FM broadcasts.

Both Digital Radio Mondiale and HD Radio are classified as in-band on-channel systems, unlike Eureka 147 (DAB: Digital Audio Broadcasting) which uses separate VHF or UHF frequency bands instead.

====BST-OFDM used in ISDB====
The &quot;band-segmented transmission orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing&quot; (&quot;BST-OFDM&quot;) system proposed for Japan (in the ISDB-T, ISDB-TSB, and ISDB-C broadcasting systems) improves upon COFDM by exploiting the fact that some OFDM carriers may be modulated differently from others within the same multiplex. Some forms of COFDM already offer this kind of hierarchical modulation, though BST-OFDM is intended to make it more flexible. The 6 MHz television channel may therefore be &quot;segmented&quot;, with different segments being modulated differently and used for different services.

It is possible, for example, to send an audio service on a segment that includes a segment composed of a number of carriers, a data service on another segment and a television service on yet another segment—all within the same 6 MHz television channel. Furthermore, these may be modulated with different parameters so that, for example, the audio and data services could be optimized for mobile reception, while the television service is optimized for stationary reception in a high-multipath environment.

===Ultra-wideband===
Ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless personal area network technology may also use OFDM, such as in Multiband OFDM (MB-OFDM). This UWB specification is advocated by the WiMedia Alliance (formerly by both the Multiband OFDM Alliance [MBOA] and the WiMedia Alliance, but the two have now merged), and is one of the competing UWB radio interfaces.

===Flash-OFDM===
&quot;Fast low-latency access with seamless handoff orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing&quot; (Flash-OFDM), also referred to as F-OFDM, was based on OFDM and also specified higher protocol layers. It was developed by Flarion, and purchased by Qualcomm in January 2006. Flash-OFDM was marketed as a packet-switched cellular bearer, to compete with GSM and 3G networks. As an example, 450 MHz frequency bands previously used by NMT-450 and C-Net C450 (both 1G analogue networks, now mostly decommissioned) in Europe are being licensed to Flash-OFDM operators.

In Finland, the license holder Digita began deployment of a nationwide &quot;@450&quot; wireless network in parts of the country since April 2007. It was purchased by Datame in 2011. In February 2012 Datame announced they would upgrade the 450 MHz network to competing CDMA2000 technology.

Slovak Telekom in Slovakia offers Flash-OFDM connections with a maximum downstream speed of 5.3 Mbit/s, and a maximum upstream speed of 1.8 Mbit/s, with a coverage of over 70 percent of Slovak population. The Flash-OFDM network was switched off in the majority of Slovakia on 30 September 2015.

T-Mobile Germany used Flash-OFDM to backhaul Wi-Fi HotSpots on the Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s ICE high speed trains between 2005 and 2015, until switching over to UMTS and LTE.

American wireless carrier Nextel Communications field tested wireless broadband network technologies including Flash-OFDM in 2005. Sprint purchased the carrier in 2006 and decided to deploy the mobile version of WiMAX, which is based on Scalable Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (SOFDMA) technology.

Citizens Telephone Cooperative launched a mobile broadband service based on Flash-OFDM technology to subscribers in parts of Virginia in March 2006. The maximum speed available was 1.5 Mbit/s. The service was discontinued on April 30, 2009.

== Vector OFDM (VOFDM) ==
VOFDM was proposed by Xiang-Gen Xia in 2000 (&quot;Proceedings of ICC 2000&quot;, New Orleans, and &quot;IEEE Trans. on Communications&quot;, Aug. 2001) for single transmit antenna systems. VOFDM replaces each scalar value in the conventional OFDM by a vector value and is a bridge between OFDM and the single carrier frequency domain equalizer (SC-FDE). When the vector size is formula_36, it is OFDM and when the vector size is at least the channel length and the FFT size is formula_36, it is SC-FDE.

In VOFDM, assume formula_38 is the vector size, and each scalar-valued signal formula_39 in OFDM is replaced by a vector-valued signal formula_40of vector size formula_38, formula_42. One takes the formula_43-point IFFT of formula_44, component-wisely and gets another vector sequence of the same vector size formula_38, formula_46. Then, one adds a vector CP of length formula_47 to this vector sequence as

: formula_48.

This vector sequence is converted to a scalar sequence by sequentializing all the vectors of size formula_38, which is transmitted at a transmit antenna sequentially.

At the receiver, the received scalar sequence is first converted to the vector sequence of vector size formula_38. When the CP length satisfies formula_51, then, after the vector CP is removed from the vector sequence and the formula_43-point FFT is implemented component-wisely to the vector sequence of length formula_43, one obtains

: formula_54

where formula_55 are additive white noise and formula_56 and formula_57 is the following formula_58 polyphase matrix of the ISI channel formula_59:

: formula_60,

where formula_61 is the formula_62th polyphase component of the channel formula_63. From (1), one can see that the original ISI channel is converted to formula_43 many vector subchannels of vector size formula_38. There is no ISI across these vector subchannels but there is ISI inside each vector subchannel. In each vector subchannel, at most formula_38 many symbols are interfered each other. Clearly, when the vector size formula_67, the above VOFDM returns to OFDM and when formula_68 and formula_69, it becomes the SC-FDE. The vector size formula_38 is a parameter that one can choose freely and properly in practice and controls the ISI level. There may be a trade-off between vector size formula_38, demodulation complexity at the receiver, and FFT size, for a given channel bandwidth. Equation (1) is mathematically new for an ISI channel, when the vector size formula_72. 

Note that the length of the CP part in the sequential form does not have to be an integer multiple of the vector size, formula_73. One can truncate the above vectorized CP to a sequential CP of length not less than the ISI channel length, which will not affect the above demodulation.

Also note that there exist many other different generalizations/forms of OFDM, to see their essential differences, it is critical to see their corresponding received signal equations to demodulate. The above VOFDM is the earliest and the only one that achieves the received signal equation (1) and/or its equivalent form, although it may have different implementations at transmitter vs. different IFFT algorithms. 

It has been shown (Yabo Li et al., &quot;IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing&quot;, Oct. 2012) that applying the MMSE linear receiver to each vector subchannel (1), it achieves multipath diversity and/or signal space diversity. This is because the vectorized channel matrices in (1) are pseudo-circulant and can be diagonalized by the formula_20-point DFT/IDFT matrix with some diagonal phase shift matrices. Then, the right hand side DFT/IDFT matrix and the formula_75th diagonal phase shift matrix in the diagonalization can be thought of the precoding to the input information symbol vector formula_76 in the formula_75th sub vector channel, and all the vectorized subchannels become diagonal channels of formula_20 discrete frequency components from the formula_79-point DFT of the original ISI channel. It may collect the multipath diversity and/or signal space diversity similar to the precoding to collect the signal space diversity for single antenna systems to combat wireless fading or the diagonal space-time block coding to collect the spatial diversity for multiple antenna systems. The details are referred to the IEEE TCOM and IEEE TSP papers mentioned above.

==Wavelet-OFDM==

OFDM has become an interesting technique for power line communications (PLC). In this area of research, a wavelet transform is introduced to replace the DFT as the method of creating orthogonal frequencies. This is due to the advantages wavelets offer, which are particularly useful on noisy power lines.

Instead of using an IDFT to create the sender signal, the wavelet OFDM uses a synthesis bank consisting of a formula_12-band transmultiplexer followed by the transform function

:formula_81

On the receiver side, an analysis bank is used to demodulate the signal again. This bank contains an inverse transform

:formula_82

followed by another formula_12-band transmultiplexer. The relationship between both transform functions is

:formula_84

An example of W-OFDM uses the Perfect Reconstruction Cosine Modulated Filter Bank (PR-CMFB) and Extended Lapped Transform (ELT) is used for the wavelet TF. Thus, formula_85 and formula_86 are given as

:formula_87

These two functions are their respective inverses, and can be used to modulate and demodulate a given input sequence. Just as in the case of DFT, the wavelet transform creates orthogonal waves with formula_88, formula_89, ..., formula_90. The orthogonality ensures that they do not interfere with each other and can be sent simultaneously. At the receiver, formula_91, formula_92, ..., formula_93 are used to reconstruct the data sequence once more.

===Advantages over standard OFDM===

W-OFDM is an evolution of the standard OFDM, with certain advantages.

Mainly, the sidelobe levels of W-OFDM are lower. This results in less ICI, as well as greater robustness to narrowband interference. These two properties are especially useful in PLC, where most of the lines aren&#x27;t shielded against EM-noise, which creates noisy channels and noise spikes.

A comparison between the two modulation techniques also reveals that the complexity of both algorithms remains approximately the same.

== Other orthogonal transforms ==

The vast majority of implementations of OFDM use the fast Fourier transform (FFT).
However, there exist other orthogonal transforms that can be used.
For example, OFDM systems based on
the discrete Hartley transform (DHT) 
and the wavelet transform
have been investigated.

<doc id="22693" wikidata="Q332629" url="?curid=22693" title="Operator overloading">
<text>In computer programming, operator overloading, sometimes termed &quot;operator ad hoc polymorphism&quot;, is a specific case of polymorphism, where different operators have different implementations depending on their arguments. Operator overloading is generally defined by a programming language, a programmer, or both.

==Rationale ==
Operator overloading is syntactic sugar, and is used because it allows programming using notation nearer to the target domain and allows user-defined types a similar level of syntactic support as types built into a language. It is common, for example, in scientific computing, where it allows computing representations of mathematical objects to be manipulated with the same syntax as on paper.

Operator overloading does not change the expressive power of a language (with functions), as it can be emulated using function calls. For example, consider variables , and of some user-defined type, such as matrices:

In a language that supports operator overloading, and with the usual assumption that the operator has higher precedence than the operator, this is a concise way of writing:

However, the former syntax reflects common mathematical usage.

==Examples==
In this case, the addition operator is overloaded to allow addition on a user-defined type in C++:
Time operator+(const Time&amp; lhs, const Time&amp; rhs) {
 Time temp = lhs;
 temp.seconds += rhs.seconds;
 temp.minutes += temp.seconds / 60;
 temp.seconds %= 60;
 temp.minutes += rhs.minutes;
 temp.hours += temp.minutes / 60;
 temp.minutes %= 60;
 temp.hours += rhs.hours;
 return temp;


Addition is a binary operation, which means it has two operands. In C++, the arguments being passed are the operands, and the object is the returned value.

The operation could also be defined as a class method, replacing by the hidden argument; However, this forces the left operand to be of type :
// The &quot;const&quot; right before the opening curly brace means that |this| is not modified.
Time Time::operator+(const Time&amp; rhs) const {
 Time temp = *this; // |this| should not be modified, so make a copy.
 temp.seconds += rhs.seconds;
 temp.minutes += temp.seconds / 60;
 temp.seconds %= 60;
 temp.minutes += rhs.minutes;
 temp.hours += temp.minutes / 60;
 temp.minutes %= 60;
 temp.hours += rhs.hours;
 return temp;


Note that a unary operator defined as a class method would receive no apparent argument (it only works from ):
bool Time::operator!() const {
 return hours == 0 &amp;&amp; minutes == 0 &amp;&amp; seconds == 0;


The less-than (&lt;) operator is often overloaded to sort a structure or class:
class Pair {
 public:
 bool operator&lt;(const Pair&amp; p) const {
 if (x_ == p.x_) {
 return y_ &lt; p.y_;
 return x_ &lt; p.x_;

 private:
 int x_;
 int y_;


Like with the previous examples, in the last example operator overloading is done within the class. In C++, after overloading the less-than operator (&lt;), standard sorting functions can be used to sort some classes.

==Criticisms==
Operator overloading has often been criticized because it allows programmers to reassign the semantics of operators depending on the types of their operands. For example, the use of the operator in C++ a « b shifts the bits in the variable left by bits if and are of an integer type, but if is an output stream then the above code will attempt to write a to the stream. Because operator overloading allows the original programmer to change the usual semantics of an operator and to catch any subsequent programmers by surprise, it is considered good practice to use operator overloading with care (the creators of Java decided not to use this feature, although not necessarily for this reason).

Another, more subtle, issue with operators is that certain rules from mathematics can be wrongly expected or unintentionally assumed. For example, the commutativity of + (i.e. that ) does not always apply; an example of this occurs when the operands are strings, since + is commonly overloaded to perform a concatenation of strings (i.e. yields , while yields ). A typical counter to this argument comes directly from mathematics: While + is commutative on integers (and more generally any complex number), it is not commutative for other &quot;types&quot; of variables. In practice, + is not even always associative, for example with floating-point values due to rounding errors. Another example: In mathematics, multiplication is commutative for real and complex numbers but not commutative in matrix multiplication.

==Catalog==
A classification of some common programming languages is made according to whether their operators are overloadable by the programmer and whether the operators are limited to a predefined set.

==Timeline of operator overloading==
===1960s===
The ALGOL 68 specification allowed operator overloading.

Extract from the ALGOL 68 language specification (page 177) where the overloaded operators ¬, =, ≠, and abs are defined:

 10.2.2. Operations on Boolean Operands
 a) op ∨ = (bool a, b) bool:( a | true | b );
 b) op ∧ = (bool a, b) bool: ( a | b | false );
 c) op ¬ = (bool a) bool: ( a | false | true );
 d) op = = (bool a, b) bool:( a∧b ) ∨ ( ¬b∧¬a );
 e) op ≠ = (bool a, b) bool: ¬(a=b);
 f) op abs = (bool a)int: ( a | 1 | 0 );

Note that no special declaration is needed to &quot;overload&quot; an operator, and the programmer is free to create new operators. For dyadic operators their priority compared to other operators can be set:

 prio max = 9;
 op max = (int a, b) int: ( a&gt;b | a | b );
 op ++ = ( ref int a ) int: ( a +:= 1 );

===1980s===
Ada supports overloading of operators from its inception, with the publication of the Ada 83 language standard. However, the language designers chose to preclude the definition of new operators. Only extant operators in the language may be overloaded, by defining new functions with identifiers such as &quot;+&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot; etc. Subsequent revisions of the language (in 1995 and 2005) maintain the restriction to overloading of extant operators.

In C++, operator overloading is more refined than in ALGOL 68.

===1990s===
Java language designers at Sun Microsystems chose to omit overloading.

Python allows operator overloading through the implementation of methods with special names. For example, the addition (+) operator can be overloaded by implementing the method .

Ruby allows operator overloading as syntactic sugar for simple method calls.

Lua allows operator overloading as syntactic sugar for method calls with the added feature that if the first operand doesn&#x27;t define that operator, the method for the second operand will be used.

===2000s===
Microsoft added operator overloading to C# in 2001 and to Visual Basic .NET in 2003.

Scala treats all operators as methods and thus allows operator overloading by proxy.

In Raku, the definition of all operators is delegated to lexical functions, and so, using function definitions, operators can be overloaded or new operators added. For example, the function defined in the Rakudo source for incrementing a Date object with &quot;+&quot; is:
multi infix:&lt;+&gt;(Date:D $d, Int:D $x) {
 Date.new-from-daycount($d.daycount + $x)


Since &quot;multi&quot; was used, the function gets added to the list of multidispatch candidates, and &quot;+&quot; is only overloaded for the case where the type constraints in the function signature are met.
While the capacity for overloading includes +, *, &gt;=, the postfix and term i, and so on, it also allows for overloading various brace operators: &quot;[x, y]&quot;, &quot;x[y]&quot;, &quot;x{&quot;y&quot;}&quot;, and &quot;x(y)&quot;.

Kotlin has supported operator overloading since its creation.

<doc id="22700" wikidata="Q500333" url="?curid=22700" title="Omphalos hypothesis">
<text>The Omphalos hypothesis is one attempt to reconcile the scientific evidence that the Earth is billions of years old with a literal interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative, which implies that the Earth is only a few thousand years old. It is based on the religious belief that the universe was created by a divine being, within the past six to ten thousand years (in keeping with flood geology), and that the presence of objective, verifiable evidence that the universe is older than approximately ten millennia is due to the creator introducing false evidence that makes the universe appear significantly older.

The idea was named after the title of an 1857 book, &quot;Omphalos&quot; by Philip Henry Gosse, in which Gosse argued that for the world to be &quot;functional&quot;, God must have created the Earth with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with fully grown hair, fingernails, and navels (ὀμφαλός &quot;omphalos&quot; is Greek for &quot;navel&quot;), and all living creatures with fully formed evolutionary features, etc., and that, therefore, &quot;no&quot; empirical evidence about the age of the Earth or universe can be taken as reliable.

Various supporters of Young Earth creationism have given different explanations for their belief that the universe is filled with false evidence of the universe&#x27;s age, including a belief that some things needed to be created at a certain age for the ecosystems to function, or their belief that the creator was deliberately planting deceptive evidence.

The idea was widely rejected in the 19th century, when Gosse published his aforementioned book. It saw some revival in the 20th century by some Young Earth creationists, who extended the argument to include visible light that appears to originate from far-off stars and galaxies (addressing the &quot;starlight problem&quot;).

==Development of the idea ==
=== Pre-scientific sources ===
Stories of the beginning of human life based on the creation story in Genesis have been published for centuries. The 4th-century theologian Ephrem the Syrian described a world in which divine creation instantly produced fully grown organisms:

=== 19th-century thinkers ===
By the 19th century, scientific evidence of the Earth&#x27;s age had been collected, and it disagreed with a literal reading of the biblical accounts. This evidence was rejected by some writers at the time, such as François-René de Chateaubriand. Chateaubriand wrote in his 1802 book, &quot;Génie du christianisme&quot; (Part I Book IV Chapter V), that &quot;God might have created, and doubtless did create, the world with all the marks of antiquity and completeness which it now exhibits.&quot; In modern times, Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb supported a similar position, saying that the objective scientific evidence for an old universe is strong, but wrong, and that the traditional Jewish calendar is correct.

In the middle of the 19th century, the disagreement between scientific evidence about the age of the Earth and the Western religious traditions was a significant debate among intellectuals. Gosse published &quot;Omphalos&quot; in 1857 to explain his answer to this question. He concluded that the religious tradition was correct. Gosse began with the earlier idea that the Earth contained mature organisms at the instant they were created, and that these organisms had false signs of their development, such as hair on mammals, which grows over time. He extended this idea of creating a single mature organism to creating mature systems, and concluded that fossils were an artifact of the creation process and merely part of what was necessary to make creation work. Therefore, he reasoned, fossils and other signs of the Earth&#x27;s age could not be used to prove its age.

Other contemporary proposals for reconciling the stories of creation in Genesis with the scientific evidence included the &quot;interval theory&quot; or gap theory of creation, in which a large interval of time passed in between the initial creation of the universe and the beginning of the Six Days of Creation. This idea was put forward by Archbishop John Bird Sumner of Canterbury in &quot;Treatise on the Records of Creation&quot;. Another popular idea, promoted by the English theologian John Pye Smith, was that the Garden of Eden described the events of only one small location. A third proposal, by French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, held that the six &quot;days&quot; of the creation story were arbitrary and large ages rather than 24-hour periods.

Theologians rejected Gosse&#x27;s proposal on the grounds that it seemed to make the divine creator tell lies—either lying in the scriptures, or lying in nature. Scientists rejected it on the grounds that it disagreed with uniformitarianism, an explanation of geology that was widely supported at the time, and the impossibility of testing or falsifying the idea.

=== Modern creationists ===
Some modern creationists still argue against scientific evidence in the same way. For instance, John D. Morris, president of the Institute for Creation Research wrote in 1990 about the &quot;appearance of age&quot;, saying that: &quot;...what [God] created was functionally complete right from the start—able to fulfill the purpose for which it was created&quot;.

He does not extend this idea to the geological record, preferring to believe that it was all created in the Flood, but others such as Gerald E. Aardsma go further, with his idea of &quot;virtual history&quot;. This appears to suggest that events after the creation have changed the &quot;virtual history&quot; we now see, including the fossils:

==Criticisms==
===Beginning of false creation===
Although Gosse&#x27;s original Omphalos hypothesis specifies a popular creation story, others have proposed that the idea does not preclude creation as recently as five minutes ago, including memories of times before this created &quot;in situ&quot;. This idea is sometimes called Last Thursdayism by its opponents, as in &quot;the world might as well have been created last Thursday.&quot;

Scientifically, the concept is both unverifiable and unfalsifiable through any conceivable scientific study—in other words, it is impossible to conclude the truth of the hypothesis, since it requires the empirical data itself to have been arbitrarily created to look the way it does at every observable level of detail.

===Deceptive creator===
From a religious viewpoint, it can be interpreted as God having created a &quot;fake&quot; universe, such as illusions of light emitted from supernovae that never really happened, or volcanic mountains that were never really volcanoes in the first place and that never actually experienced erosion.

In a rebuttal of the claim that God might have implanted a false history of the age of the universe to test our faith in the truth of the Torah, Rabbi Natan Slifkin, an author whose works have been banned by several Haredi rabbis for going against the tenets of the Talmud, writes:

==Similar formulations==

===Five-minute hypothesis===
The five-minute hypothesis is a skeptical hypothesis put forth by the philosopher Bertrand Russell, that proposes that the universe sprang into existence five minutes ago from nothing, with human memory and all other signs of history included. It is a commonly used example of how one may maintain extreme philosophical skepticism with regard to memory and trust in evidentially derived historical chronology.

===Borges&#x27;s &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;===
Jorge Luis Borges, in his 1940 work, &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;, describes a fictional world in which some essentially follow as a religious belief a philosophy much like Russell&#x27;s discussion on the logical extreme of Gosse&#x27;s theory:

Borges had earlier written a short essay, &quot;The Creation and P. H. Gosse&quot; that explored the rejection of Gosse&#x27;s &quot;Omphalos&quot;. Borges argued that its unpopularity stemmed from Gosse&#x27;s explicit (if inadvertent) outlining of what Borges characterized as absurdities in the Genesis story.
