<doc id="19891" wikidata="Q627627" url="?curid=19891" title="Macron (diacritic)">
<text>A macron ( ) is a diacritical mark: it is a straight bar placed above a letter, usually a vowel. Its name derives from Ancient Greek (&quot;makrón&quot;) &#x27;long&#x27; because it was originally used to mark long or heavy syllables in Greco-Roman metrics. It now more often marks a long vowel. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the macron is used to indicate a mid-tone; the sign for a long vowel is instead a modified triangular colon .

The opposite is the breve , which marks a short or light syllable or a short vowel.

==Uses==
===Syllable weight===
In Greco-Roman metrics and in the description of the metrics of other literatures, the macron was introduced and is still widely used in dictionaries and educational materials to mark a long (heavy) syllable. Even relatively recent classical Greek and Latin dictionaries are still concerned with indicating only the length (weight) of syllables; that is why most still do not indicate the length of vowels in syllables that are otherwise metrically determined. Many textbooks about Ancient Rome and Greece use the macron, even if it was not actually used at that time (an apex was used if vowel length was marked in Latin).

===Vowel length===
The following languages or transliteration systems use the macron to mark long vowels:

* Slavicists use the macron to indicate a non-tonic long vowel, or a non-tonic syllabic liquid, such as on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, or &quot;u&quot;. Languages with this feature include standard and dialect varieties of Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, and Bulgarian.
* Transcriptions of Arabic typically use macrons to indicate long vowels – (alif when pronounced ), (waw, when pronounced or ), and (ya&#x27;, when pronounced or ). Thus the Arabic word (three) is transliterated &quot;thalāthah&quot;.
*Transcriptions of Sanskrit typically use a macron over ā, ī, ū, ṝ, and ḹ in order to mark a long vowel (e and o are always long and consequently do not need any macron).
* In Latin, many of the more recent dictionaries and learning materials use the macron as the modern equivalent of the ancient Roman apex to mark long vowels. Any of the six vowel letters &quot;(ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, ȳ)&quot; can bear it. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the breve, especially to distinguish the short vowels and from their semi-vowel counterparts and , originally, and often to this day, spelt with the same letters. However, the older of these editions are not always explicit on whether they mark long vowels or heavy syllables – a confusion that is even found in some modern learning materials. In addition, most of the newest academic publications use both the macron and the breve sparingly, mainly when vowel length is relevant to the discussion.
*In romanization of classical Greek, the letters η (&quot;eta&quot;) and ω (&quot;omega&quot;) are transliterated, respectively, as &quot;ē&quot; and &quot;ō&quot;, representing the long vowels of classical Greek, whereas the short vowels ε (&quot;epsilon&quot;) and ο (&quot;omicron&quot;) are always transliterated as plain &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o.&quot; The other long vowel phonemes do not have dedicated letters in the Greek alphabet, being indicated by digraphs (transliterated likewise as digraphs) or by the letters α, ι, υ – represented as &quot;ā, ī, ū&quot;. The same three letters are transliterated as plain &quot;a, i, u&quot; when representing short vowels.
* The Hepburn romanization system of Japanese, for example, &quot;tā&quot; () as opposed to &quot;ta&quot; ().
* The Syriac language uses macrons to indicate long vowels in its romanized transliteration: &quot;ā&quot; for , &quot;ē&quot; for , &quot;ū&quot; for and &quot;ō&quot; for .
* Baltic languages and Baltic-Finnic languages:
** Latvian. &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;ē&quot;, &quot;ī&quot;, &quot;ū&quot; are separate letters but are given the same position in collation as &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot; respectively. &quot;Ō&quot; was also used in Latvian, but it was discarded as of 1946. Some usage remains in Latgalian.
** Lithuanian. &quot;ū&quot; is a separate letter but is given the same position in collation as the unaccented &quot;u&quot;. It marks a long vowel; other long vowels are indicated with an ogonek (which used to indicate nasalization, but it no longer does): &quot;ą&quot;, &quot;ę&quot;, &quot;į&quot;, &quot;ų&quot; and &quot;o&quot; being always long in Lithuanian except for some recent loanwords. For the long counterpart of &quot;i&quot;, &quot;y&quot; is used.
** Livonian. &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;ǟ&quot;, &quot;ē&quot;, &quot;ī&quot;, &quot;ō&quot;, &quot;ȱ&quot;, &quot;ȭ&quot; and &quot;ū&quot; are separate letters that sort in alphabetical order immediately after &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;ȯ&quot;, &quot;õ&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;, respectively.
** Samogitian. &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;ē&quot;, &quot;ė̄&quot;, &quot;ī&quot;, &quot;ū&quot; and &quot;ō&quot; are separate letters that sort in alphabetical order immediately after &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ė&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot; and &quot;o&quot; respectively.
* Transcriptions of Nahuatl, the Aztecs&#x27; language, spoken in Mexico. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived, they wrote the language in their own alphabet without distinguishing long vowels. Over a century later, in 1645, Horacio Carochi defined macrons to mark long vowels &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;ē&quot;, &quot;ī&quot; and &quot;ō&quot;, and short vowels with grave (`) accents. This is rare nowadays since many people write Nahuatl without any orthographic sign and with the letters &quot;k&quot;, &quot;s&quot; and &quot;w&quot;, not present in the original alphabet.
* Modern transcriptions of Old English, for long vowels.
* Latin transliteration of Pali and Sanskrit, and in the IAST and ISO 15919 transcriptions of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages.
*Polynesian languages:
**Cook Islands Māori. In Cook Islands Māori, the macron or &quot;mākarōna&quot; is not commonly used in writing, but is used in references and teaching materials for those learning the language.
**Hawaiian. The macron is called &quot;kahakō&quot;, and it indicates vowel length, which changes meaning and the placement of stress.
**Māori. In modern written Māori, the macron is used to designate long vowels, with the trema mark sometimes used if the macron is unavailable (e.g. &quot;wähine&quot;). The Māori word for macron is &quot;tohutō.&quot; The term &quot;pōtae&quot; (&quot;hat&quot;) is also used. In the past, writing in Māori either did not distinguish vowel length, or doubled long vowels (e.g. &quot;waahine&quot;), as some iwi dialects still do.
**Niuean. In Niuean, &quot;popular spelling&quot; does not worry too much about vowel quantity (length), so the macron is primarily used in scholarly study of the language.
** Tahitian. The use of the macron is comparatively recent in Tahitian. The &quot;Fare Vānaa&quot; or &quot;Académie Tahitienne&quot; (Tahitian Academy) recommends using the macron, called the &quot;tārava,&quot; to represent long vowels in written text, especially for scientific or teaching texts and it has widespread acceptance. (In the past, written Tahitian either did not distinguish vowel length, or used multiple other ways).
** Tongan and Samoan. The macron is called the &quot;toloi/fakamamafa&quot; or &quot;fa&#x27;amamafa&quot;, respectively. Its usage is similar to that in Māori, including its substitution by a trema. Its usage is not universal in Samoan, but recent academic publications and advanced study textbooks promote its use.
* The macron is used in Fijian language dictionaries, in instructional materials for non-Fijian speakers, and in books and papers on Fijian linguistics. It is not typically used in Fijian publications intended for fluent speakers, where context is usually sufficient for a reader to distinguish between heteronyms.
* Both Cyrillic and Latin transcriptions of Udege.
* The Latin and Cyrillic alphabet transcriptions of the Tsebari dialect of Tsez.
* In western Cree, Sauk, and Saulteaux, the Algonquianist Standard Roman Orthography (SRO) indicates long vowels either with a circumflex ⟨&quot;â ê î ô&quot;⟩ or with a macron ⟨&quot;ā ē ī ō&quot;⟩.

===Tone===
The following languages or alphabets use the macron to mark tones:

* In the International Phonetic Alphabet, a macron over a vowel indicates a mid-level tone.
* In Yoruba an optional macron can be used to indicate mid-level tone if it would otherwise be ambiguous.
* In Pinyin, the official Romanization of Mandarin Chinese, macrons over a, e, i, o, u, ü (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, ǖ) indicate the high level tone of Mandarin Chinese. The alternative to the macron is the number 1 after the syllable (for example, tā = ta1).
* Similarly in the Yale romanization of Cantonese, macrons over a, e, i, o, u, m, n (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, m̄, n̄) indicate the high level tone of Cantonese. Like Mandarin, the alternative to the macron is the number 1 after the syllable (for example, tā = ta1).
* In Pe̍h-ōe-jī romanization of Hokkien, macrons over a, e, i, m, n, o, o͘, u, (ā, ē, ī, m̄, n̄, ō, ō͘, ū) indicate the mid level tone (&quot;light departing&quot; or 7th tone) of Hokkien.

===Omission===
Sometimes the macron marks an omitted &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot;, like the tilde, in which context it is referred to as a &quot;nasal suspension&quot;:
* In Old English texts a macron above a letter indicates the omission of an &quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot; that would normally follow that letter.
* In older handwriting such as the German Kurrentschrift, the macron over an a-e-i-o-u or ä-ö-ü stood for an &quot;n&quot;, or over an &quot;m&quot; or an &quot;n&quot; meant that the letter was doubled. This continued into print in English in the sixteenth century, and to some extent in German. Over a &quot;u&quot; at the end of a word, the macron indicated &quot;um&quot; as a form of scribal abbreviation.

===Letter extension===
In romanizations of Hebrew, the macron below is typically used to mark the begadkefat consonant lenition. However, for typographical reasons a regular macron is used on &quot;p&quot; and &quot;g&quot; instead: &quot;p̄, ḡ&quot;.

The macron is used in the orthography of a number of vernacular languages of the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, particularly those first transcribed by Anglican missionaries. The macron has no unique value, and is simply used to distinguish between two different phonemes.

Thus, in several languages of the Banks Islands, including Mwotlap, the simple &quot;m&quot; stands for , but an &quot;m&quot; with a macron (m̄) is a rounded labial-velar nasal ; while the simple &quot;n&quot; stands for the common alveolar nasal , an &quot;n&quot; with macron (n̄) represents the velar nasal ; the vowel ē stands for a (short) higher by contrast with plain &quot;e&quot; ; likewise ō contrasts with plain &quot;o&quot; .

In Hiw orthography, the consonant &quot;r̄&quot; stands for the prestopped velar lateral approximant .
In Araki, the same symbol &quot;r̄&quot; encodes the alveolar trill – by contrast with &quot;r&quot;, which encodes the alveolar flap .

In Bislama (orthography before 1995), Lamenu and Lewo, a macron is used on two letters &quot;&quot;. &quot;m̄&quot; represents , and &quot;p̄&quot; represents . The orthography after 1995 (which has no diacritics) has these written as &quot;mw&quot; and &quot;pw&quot;.

In Kokota, &quot;ḡ&quot; is used for the velar stop , but &quot;g&quot; without macron is the voiced velar fricative .

In Marshallese, a macron is used on four letters – &#x27; – whose pronunciations differ from the unmarked &#x27;. Marshallese uses a vertical vowel system with three to four vowel phonemes, but traditionally their allophones have been written out, so vowel letters with macron are used for some of these allophones. Though the standard diacritic involved is a macron, there are no other diacritics used &quot;above&quot; letters, so in practice other diacritics can and have been used in less polished writing or print, yielding nonstandard letters like &quot;, depending on displayability of letters in computer fonts.
* The letter &quot; is pronounced , the palatalized allophone of the phoneme .
* The letter &#x27; represents the velar nasal phoneme and the labialized velar nasal phoneme , depending on context. The standard letter does not exist as a precombined glyph in Unicode, so the nonstandard variant &#x27; is often used in its place.
* The letter &quot; is pronounced or , which are the unrounded velarized allophones of the phonemes and respectively.
* The letter &quot; is pronounced , the unrounded velarized allophone of the phoneme .

In Obolo, the simple n stands for the common alveolar nasal , while an &quot;n&quot; with macron (n̄) represents the velar nasal .

===Other uses===
* In older German and in the German Kurrent handwriting, as well as older Danish, a macron is used on some consonants, especially n and m, as a short form for a double consonant (for example, &quot;n̄&quot; instead of &quot;nn&quot;).
* In Russian cursive, as well as in some others based on the Cyrillic script (for example, Bulgarian), a lowercase &quot;Т&quot; looks like a lowercase &quot;m&quot;, and a macron is often used to distinguish it from &quot;Ш&quot;, which looks like a lowercase &quot;w&quot; (see &quot;Т&quot;). Some writers also underline the letter &quot;ш&quot; to reduce ambiguity further.

Also, in some instances, a diacritic will be written like a macron, although it represents another diacritic whose standard form is different:

* In some Finnish, Estonian and Swedish comic books that are hand-lettered, or in handwriting, a macron-style umlaut is used for &quot;ä&quot; or &quot;ö&quot; (also &quot;õ&quot; and &quot;ü&quot; in Estonian), sometimes known colloquially as a &quot;lazy man&#x27;s umlaut&quot;. This can also be seen in some modern handwritten German.
* In Norwegian &quot;ū&quot;, &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;ī&quot;, &quot;ē&quot; and &quot;ō&quot; can be used for decorative purposes both in handwritten and computed Bokmål and Nynorsk or to denote vowel length such as in &quot;dū&quot; (you), &quot;lā&quot; (infinitive form of to let), lēser (present form of &quot;to read&quot;) and &quot;lūft&quot; (air). The diacritic is entirely optional, carries no IPA value and is seldom used in modern Norwegian outside of handwriting.
* In informal Hungarian handwriting, a macron is often a substitute for either a double acute accent or an umlaut (e.g., &quot;ö&quot; or &quot;ő&quot;). Because of this ambiguity, using it is often regarded as bad practice.
* In informal handwriting, the Spanish &quot;ñ&quot; is sometimes written with a macron-shaped tilde: (&quot;n̄&quot;).

===Medicine===

Continuing previous Latin scribal abbreviations, letters with combining macron can be used in various European languages to represent the overlines indicating various medical abbreviations, particularly including:

* ā for (&quot;before&quot;)
* c̄ for (&quot;with&quot;)
* p̄ for (&quot;after&quot;)
* q̄ for and its inflections (&quot;every&quot;, &quot;each&quot;)
* s̄ for (&quot;without&quot;)
* x̄ for and its inflections (&quot;except&quot;)

Note, however, that abbreviations involving the letter h take their macron halfway up the ascending line rather than at the normal height for unicode macrons and overlines: ħ. This is separately encoded in Unicode with the symbols using bar diacritics and appears shorter than other macrons in many fonts.

===Mathematics and science===
The overline is a typographical symbol similar to the macron, used in a number of ways in mathematics and science. For example, it is used to represent complex conjugation:

formula_1

and to represent a line segment in geometry (e.g., formula_2), sample means in statistics (e.g., formula_3) and negations in logic. It is also used in Hermann–Mauguin notation.

===Music===
In music, the tenuto marking resembles the macron.

The macron is also used in German lute tablature to distinguish repeating alphabetic characters.

In TeX a macron is created with the command &quot;\=&quot;, for example: M\=aori for Māori.
In OpenOffice, if the extension Compose Special Characters is installed, a macron may be added by following the letter with a hyphen and pressing the user&#x27;s predefined shortcut key for composing special characters. A macron may also be added by following the letter with the character&#x27;s four-digit hex-code, and pressing the user&#x27;s predefined shortcut key for adding unicode characters.

<doc id="19894" wikidata="Q32815" url="?curid=19894" title="Mosque">
<text>A mosque ( ), also called a masjid ( ), is a place of worship for Muslims. The term usually refers to a covered building, but can be any place where Islamic prayers are performed, such as an outdoor courtyard.

Originally, mosques were simple places of prayer for the early Muslims, and may have been open spaces rather than elaborate buildings. In the first stage of Islamic architecture (650–750 CE), early mosques comprised open and closed covered spaces enclosed by walls, often with minarets, from which the Islamic call to prayer was issued on a daily basis. It is typical of mosque buildings to have a special ornamental niche (a &quot;mihrab&quot;) set into the wall in the direction of the city of Mecca (the &quot;qibla&quot;), which Muslims must face during prayer, as well as a facility for ritual cleansing (&quot;wudu&quot;). The pulpit (&quot;minbar&quot;), from which public sermons (&quot;khutbah&quot;) are delivered on the event of Friday prayer, was, in earlier times, characteristic of the central city mosque, but has since become common in smaller mosques. To varying degrees, mosque buildings are designed so that there are segregated spaces for men and women. This basic pattern of organization has assumed different forms depending on the region, period, and Islamic denomination.

In addition to being places of worship in Islam, mosques also serve as locations for funeral services and funeral prayers, marriages (nikah), vigils during Ramadan, business agreements, collection and distribution of alms, and homeless shelters. To this end, mosques have historically been multi-purpose buildings functioning as community centres, courts of law, and religious schools. In modern times, they have also preserved their role as places of religious instruction and debate. Special importance is accorded to, in descending order of importance: al-Masjid al-Haram in the city of Mecca, where Hajj and Umrah are performed; the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in the city of Medina, where Muhammad is buried; and al-Aqsa Mosque in the city of Jerusalem, where Muslims believe that Muhammad ascended to heaven to meet God around 621 CE. There&#x27;s a growing realization among scholars that the present-day perception of mosques doesn&#x27;t fully align with their original concept. Early Islamic texts and practices highlight mosques as vibrant centers integral to Muslim communities, supporting religious, social, economic, and political affairs.

During and after the early Muslim conquests, mosques were established outside of Arabia in the hundreds; many synagogues, churches, and temples were converted into mosques and thus influenced Islamic architectural styles over the centuries. While most pre-modern mosques were funded by charitable endowments (&quot;waqf&quot;), the modern-day trend of government regulation of large mosques has been countered by the rise of privately funded mosques, many of which serve as bases for different streams of Islamic revivalism and social activism.

==Etymology==
The word &#x27;mosque&#x27; entered the English language from the French word &quot;mosquée&quot;, probably derived from Italian &quot;moschea&quot; (a variant of Italian &quot;moscheta&quot;), from either Middle Armenian (&quot;mzkit&quot;), Medieval (&quot;masgídion&quot;), or Spanish &quot;mezquita&quot;, from (meaning &quot;site of prostration (in prayer)&quot; and hence a place of worship), either from Nabataean &quot;masgĕdhā́&quot; or from Arabic (meaning &quot;to prostrate&quot;), probably ultimately from Nabataean Arabic &quot;masgĕdhā́&quot; or Aramaic &quot;sĕghēdh&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
Islam was established in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad in the 7th century CE. The first mosque in history could be either the sanctuary built around the &quot;Ka&#x27;bah&quot; in Mecca, known today as &quot;Al-Masjid al-Haram&quot; (&#x27;The Sacred Mosque&#x27;), or the Quba Mosque in Medina, the first structure built by Muhammad upon his emigration from Mecca in 622 CE, both located in the Hejaz region in present-day Saudi Arabia.

Other scholars reference Islamic tradition and passages of the Quran, according to which Islam as a religion precedes Muhammad, and includes previous prophets such as Abraham. In Islamic tradition, Abraham is credited with having built the &quot;Ka&#x27;bah&quot; in Mecca, and consequently its sanctuary, &quot;Al-Masjid al-Haram&quot;, which is seen by Muslims as the first mosque that existed. A hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari states that the sanctuary of the &quot;Ka&#x27;bah&quot; was the first mosque on Earth, with the second mosque being Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem, which is also associated with Abraham. Since as early as 638 CE, the Sacred Mosque of Mecca has been expanded on several occasions to accommodate the increasing number of Muslims who either live in the area or make the annual pilgrimage known as &quot;Hajj&quot; to the city.

Either way, after the Quba Mosque, Muhammad went on to establish another mosque in Medina, which is now known as &quot;Al-Masjid an-Nabawi&quot; (&#x27;The Prophet&#x27;s Mosque&#x27;). Built on the site of his home, Muhammad participated in the construction of the mosque himself and helped pioneer the concept of the mosque as the focal point of the Islamic city. The Prophet&#x27;s Mosque is considered by some scholars of Islamic architecture to be the first mosque. The mosque had a roof supported by columns made of palm tree trunks and it included a large courtyard, a motif common among mosques built since then. Rebuilt and expanded over time, it soon became a larger hypostyle structure. It probably served as a model for the construction of early mosques elsewhere. It introduced some of the features still common in today&#x27;s mosques, including the niche at the front of the prayer space known as the &quot;mihrab&quot; (first added in the Umayyad period) and the tiered pulpit called the &quot;minbar&quot;.

===Diffusion and evolution===

The Umayyad Caliphate was particularly instrumental in spreading Islam and establishing mosques within the Levant, as the Umayyads constructed among the most revered mosques in the region — Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, and the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. The designs of the Dome of the Rock and the Umayyad Mosque were influenced by Byzantine architecture, a trend that continued much later with the rise of the Ottoman Empire.

The Great Mosque of Kairouan in present-day Tunisia was the first mosque built in the Maghreb (northwest Africa), with its present form (dating from the ninth century) serving as a model for other Islamic places of worship in the Maghreb. It was the first in the region to incorporate a square minaret, which was characteristic of later Maghrebi mosques, and includes naves akin to a basilica. Those features can also be found in Andalusi mosques, including the Great Mosque of Cordoba, as they tended to reflect the architecture of the Moors instead of their Visigoth predecessors. Still, some elements of Visigothic architecture, like horseshoe arches, were infused into the mosque architecture of Spain and the Maghreb.

Muslim empires were instrumental in the evolution and spread of mosques. Although mosques were first established in India during the seventh century, they were not commonplace across the subcontinent until the arrival of the Mughals in the 16th and 17th centuries. Reflecting their Timurid origins, Mughal-style mosques included onion domes, pointed arches, and elaborate circular minarets, features common in the Persian and Central Asian styles. The Jama Masjid in Delhi and the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore, built in a similar manner in the mid-17th century, remain two of the largest mosques on the Indian subcontinent.

The first mosque in East Asia was established in the eighth century in Xi&#x27;an. The Great Mosque of Xi&#x27;an, whose current building dates from the 18th century, does not replicate the features often associated with mosques elsewhere. Minarets were initially prohibited by the state. Following traditional Chinese architecture, the Great Mosque of Xi&#x27;an, like many other mosques in eastern China, resembles a pagoda, with a green roof instead of the yellow roof common on imperial structures in China. Mosques in western China were more likely to incorporate elements, like domes and minarets, traditionally seen in mosques elsewhere.A similar integration of foreign and local influences could be seen on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java, where mosques, including the Demak Great Mosque, were first established in the 15th century. Early Javanese mosques took design cues from Hindu, Buddhist, and Chinese architectural influences, with tall timber, multi-level roofs similar to the pagodas of Balinese Hindu temples; the ubiquitous Islamic dome did not appear in Indonesia until the 19th century. In turn, the Javanese style influenced the styles of mosques in Indonesia&#x27;s Austronesian neighbors—Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines.

Several of the early mosques in the Ottoman Empire were originally churches or cathedrals from the Byzantine Empire, with the Hagia Sophia (one of those converted cathedrals) informing the architecture of mosques from after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople. The Ottomans developed their own architectural style characterized by large central domes (sometimes surrounded by multiple smaller domes), pencil-shaped minarets, and open façades.
Mosques from the Ottoman period are still scattered across Eastern Europe, but the most rapid growth in the number of mosques in Europe has occurred within the past century as more Muslims have migrated to the continent. Many major European cities are home to mosques, like the Grand Mosque of Paris, that incorporate domes, minarets, and other features often found with mosques in Muslim-majority countries. The first mosque in North America was founded by Albanian Americans in 1915, but the continent&#x27;s oldest surviving mosque, the Mother Mosque of America, was built in 1934. As in Europe, the number of American mosques has rapidly increased in recent decades as Muslim immigrants, particularly from South Asia, have come in the United States. Greater than forty percent of mosques in the United States were constructed after 2000.

===Inter-religious conversion===

According to early Muslim historians, towns that surrendered without resistance and made treaties with the Muslims were allowed to retain their churches and the towns captured by Muslims had many of their churches converted to mosques. One of the earliest examples of these kinds of conversions was in Damascus, Syria, where in 705 Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I bought the church of St. John from the Christians and had it rebuilt as a mosque in exchange for building a number of new churches for the Christians in Damascus. Overall, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (Al-Waleed&#x27;s father) is said to have transformed 10 churches in Damascus into mosques.

The process of turning churches into mosques were especially intensive in the villages where most of the inhabitants converted to Islam. The Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun turned many churches into mosques. Ottoman Turks converted nearly all churches, monasteries, and chapels in Constantinople, including the famous Hagia Sophia, into mosques immediately after capturing the city in 1453. In some instances mosques have been established on the places of Jewish or Christian sanctuaries associated with Biblical personalities who were also recognized by Islam.

Mosques have also been converted for use by other religions, notably in southern Spain, following the conquest of the Moors in 1492. The most prominent of them is the Great Mosque of Cordoba, itself constructed on the site of a church demolished during the period of Muslim rule. Outside of the Iberian Peninsula, such instances also occurred in southeastern Europe once regions were no longer under Muslim rule.

==Religious functions==
===Prayers===

There are two holidays (&quot;Eids&quot;) in the Islamic calendar: &quot;ʿĪd al-Fiṭr&quot; and &quot;ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā&quot;, during which there are special prayers held at mosques in the morning. These Eid prayers are supposed to be offered in large groups, and so, in the absence of an outdoor &quot;Eidgah&quot;, a large mosque will normally host them for their congregants as well as the congregants of smaller local mosques. Some mosques will even rent convention centers or other large public buildings to hold the large number of Muslims who attend. Mosques, especially those in countries where Muslims are the majority, will also host Eid prayers outside in courtyards, town squares or on the outskirts of town in an &quot;Eidgah&quot;.

===Ramadan===

Islam&#x27;s holiest month, &quot;Ramaḍān&quot;, is observed through many events. As Muslims must fast during the day during Ramadan, mosques will host &quot;Ifṭār&quot; dinners after sunset and the fourth required prayer of the day, that is &quot;Maghrib&quot;. Food is provided, at least in part, by members of the community, thereby creating daily potluck dinners. Because of the community contribution necessary to serve &quot;iftar&quot; dinners, mosques with smaller congregations may not be able to host the &quot;iftar&quot; dinners daily. Some mosques will also hold &quot;Suḥūr&quot; meals before dawn to congregants attending the first required prayer of the day, &quot;Fajr&quot;. As with iftar dinners, congregants usually provide the food for suhoor, although able mosques may provide food instead. Mosques will often invite poorer members of the Muslim community to share in beginning and breaking the fasts, as providing charity during Ramadan is regarded in Islam as especially honorable.

Following the last obligatory daily prayer (&quot;ʿIshāʾ&quot;) special, optional &quot;Tarāwīḥ&quot; prayers are offered in larger mosques. During each night of prayers, which can last for up to two hours each night, usually one member of the community who has memorized the entire Quran (a Hafiz) will recite a segment of the book. Sometimes, several such people (not necessarily of the local community) take turns to do this. During the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques will host all-night programs to observe &quot;Laylat al-Qadr&quot;, the night Muslims believe that Muhammad first received Quranic revelations. On that night, between sunset and sunrise, mosques employ speakers to educate congregants in attendance about Islam. Mosques or the community usually provide meals periodically throughout the night
During the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques within the Muslim community will host &quot;Iʿtikāf&quot;, a practice in which at least one Muslim man from the community must participate. Muslims performing itikaf are required to stay within the mosque for ten consecutive days, often in worship or learning about Islam. As a result, the rest of the Muslim community is responsible for providing the participants with food, drinks, and whatever else they need during their stay.

===Charity===

The third of the Five Pillars of Islam states that Muslims are required to give approximately one-fortieth of their wealth to charity as &quot;Zakat&quot;. Since mosques form the center of Muslim communities, they are where Muslims go to both give &quot;zakat&quot; and, if necessary, collect it. Before the holiday of &quot;Eid ul-Fitr&quot;, mosques also collect a special &quot;zakat&quot; that is supposed to assist in helping poor Muslims attend the prayers and celebrations associated with the holiday.

===Frequency of attendance===

The frequency by which Muslims attend mosque services vary greatly around the world. In some countries, weekly attendance at religious services is common among Muslims while in others, attendance is rare. A study of American Muslims did not find differences in mosque attendance by gender or age.
==Architecture==
===Styles===
&quot;Arab-plan&quot; or hypostyle mosques are the earliest type of mosques, pioneered under the Umayyad Dynasty. These mosques have square or rectangular plans with an enclosed courtyard (&quot;sahn&quot;) and covered prayer hall. Historically, in the warm Middle Eastern and Mediterranean climates, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat roofs on prayer halls, which required the use of numerous columns and supports. One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, the building being supported by over 850 columns. Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer arcades (&quot;riwaq&quot;) so that visitors can enjoy the shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties. The simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, the mosques consequently losing popularity.

The first departure within mosque design started in Persia (Iran). The Persians had inherited a rich architectural legacy from the earlier Persian dynasties, and they began incorporating elements from earlier Parthian and Sassanid designs into their mosques, influenced by buildings such as the Palace of Ardashir and the Sarvestan Palace. Thus, Islamic architecture witnessed the introduction of such structures as domes and large, arched entrances, referred to as &quot;iwans&quot;. During Seljuq rule, as Islamic mysticism was on the rise, the four-iwan arrangement took form. The four-iwan format, finalized by the Seljuqs, and later inherited by the Safavids, firmly established the courtyard façade of such mosques, with the towering gateways at every side, as more important than the actual buildings themselves. They typically took the form of a square-shaped central courtyard with large entrances at each side, giving the impression of gateways to the spiritual world. The Persians also introduced Persian gardens into mosque designs. Soon, a distinctly Persian style of mosques started appearing that would significantly influence the designs of later Timurid, and also Mughal, mosque designs.

The Ottomans introduced central dome mosques in the 15th century. These mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having a large central dome, a common feature is smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed. This style was heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture with its use of large central domes.

Islam forbids figurative art, on the grounds that the artist must not imitate God&#x27;s creation. Mosques are, therefore, decorated with abstract patterns and beautiful inscriptions. Decoration is often concentrated around doorways and the &quot;miḥrāb&quot;. Tiles are used widely in mosques. They lend themselves to pattern-making, can be made with beautiful subtle colors, and can create a cool atmosphere, an advantage in the hot Arab countries. Quotations from the Quran often adorn mosque interiors. These texts are meant to inspire people by their beauty, while also reminding them of the words of Allah.

===Prayer hall===
The prayer hall, also known as the &quot;muṣallá&quot; (), rarely has furniture; chairs and pews are generally absent from the prayer hall so as to allow as many worshipers as possible to line the room. Some mosques have Islamic calligraphy and Quranic verses on the walls to create a more religious atmosphere for worshippers.

Often, a limited part of the prayer hall is sanctified formally as a &quot;masjid&quot; in the &quot;sharīʿah&quot; sense (although the term &quot;masjid&quot; is also used for the larger mosque complex as well). Once designated, there are onerous limitations on the use of this formally designated &quot;masjid&quot;, and it may not be used for any purpose other than worship; restrictions that do not necessarily apply to the rest of the prayer area, and to the rest of the mosque complex (although such uses may be restricted by the conditions of the &quot;waqf&quot; that owns the mosque).

In many mosques, especially the early congregational mosques, the prayer hall is built in the hypostyle form (the roof held up by a multitude of columns). One of the finest examples of the hypostyle-plan mosques is the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia.

Usually opposite the entrance to the prayer hall is the &quot;qibla&quot; wall (the direction of Mecca, and thus the direction towards which Muslims should face for prayer), the visually emphasized area inside the prayer hall. The &quot;qibla&quot; wall should, in a properly oriented mosque, be set perpendicular to a line leading to Mecca, where the Kaaba is located. Congregants pray in rows parallel to the qiblah wall and thus arrange themselves so they face Mecca. In the &quot;qibla&quot; wall, usually at its center, is the &quot;miḥrāb&quot;, a niche or depression indicating the direction of Mecca. Usually the &quot;mihrab&quot; is not occupied by furniture either. A raised &quot;minbar&quot; (pulpit) is located to the right side of the &quot;mihrab&quot; for a &quot;khaṭīb&quot; (preacher), or some other speaker, to offer a &quot;khuṭbah&quot; (sermon) during the ritual Friday prayers.

The &quot;mihrab&quot; serves as the location where the imam or mullah leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis. Left to the &quot;mihrab&quot;, in the front left corner of the mosque, sometimes there is a &quot;kursu&quot; (Turkish: , Bosnian: &quot;&quot;), a small elevated plateau (rarely with a chair or other type of seat) used for less formal preaching and speeches.

====Women&#x27;s prayer hall====
Women who pray in mosques are separated from men. Their part for prayer is called &quot;maqfil&quot; (Bosnian: &quot;&quot;). It is located above the main prayer hall, elevated in the background as stairs-separated gallery or plateau (surface-shortened to the back relative to the bottom main part). It usually has a perforated fence at the front, through which the imam or mullah and the other male worshippers in the main hall can be partially seen.

===Mihrab===
A &quot;miḥrāb&quot;, also spelled as &quot;mehrab&quot; is a semicircular niche in the wall of a mosque that faces the &quot;qiblah&quot; (i.e. the &quot;front&quot; of the mosque); the imam stands in this niche and leads prayer. Given that the imam typically stands alone in the frontmost row, this niche&#x27;s practical effect is to save unused space. The &quot;minbar&quot; is a pulpit from which the Friday sermon is delivered. While the &quot;minbar&quot; of Muhammad was a simple chair, later it became larger and attracted artistic attention. Some remained made of wood, albeit exquisitely carved, while others were made of marble and featured friezes.

===Minarets===

A common feature in mosques is the minaret, the tall, slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure. The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area. The origin of the minaret and its initial functions are not clearly known and have long been a topic of scholarly discussion. The earliest mosques lacked minarets, and the call to prayer was often performed from smaller structures or elevated platforms. The early Muslim community of Medina gave the call to prayer from the doorway or the roof of the house of Muhammad, which doubled as a place for prayer. The first confirmed minarets in the form of towers date from the early 9th century under Abbasid rule and they did not become a standard feature of mosques until the 11th century. These first minaret towers were placed in the middle of the wall opposite the qibla wall. Among them, the minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia, dating from 836, is well-preserved and is one of the oldest surviving minarets in the world today.

Before the five required daily prayers, a &quot;Mu&#x27;adhdhin&quot; () calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims are not the majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the &quot;Adhān&quot; (, Call to Prayer), although it is supposed to be said loudly to the surrounding community. The &quot;adhan&quot; is required before every prayer. Nearly every mosque assigns a &quot;muezzin&quot; for each prayer to say the &quot;adhan&quot; as it is a recommended practice or &quot;Sunnah&quot; () of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the &quot;adhan&quot; is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground. The &quot;Iqâmah&quot; (), which is similar to the &quot;adhan&quot; and proclaimed right before the commencement of prayers, is usually not proclaimed from the minaret even if a mosque has one.

===Domes===
Domes have been a prominent feature in mosque architecture for centuries, evolving both in form and function. Traditionally placed above the main prayer hall, they symbolize the connection between the earthly and divine, often representing the vaults of heaven and sky. Initially, domes were small structures above the mihrab, but over time, they expanded to cover the entire roof of the prayer hall. The shape of the dome evolved from simple hemispherical forms to more complex designs, with the Mughals in India popularizing the onion-shaped dome, which became a hallmark of South Asian and Arabic mosque architecture. The design and function of domes have been influenced by various cultures, including Persian, Byzantine, and Central Asian traditions, each contributing to the techniques and aesthetics used in their construction. Today, domes continue to serve both structural and spiritual purposes, with modern innovations further enhancing their functionality and sustainability.

Structural and functional roles

Domes not only serve as architectural focal points but also enhance mosque acoustics, amplifying the sound of the prayer and the sermon. Structurally, they allow vast interior spaces with minimal internal supports and they make the mosque appear bigger on the inside. Their placement above the prayer hall symbolizes the connection between the earthly and the divine, reinforcing the mosque&#x27;s spiritual purpose.

Origin of mosque domes

The origin of domes in mosque architecture can be traced back to the early Islamic period, particularly under the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750 AD). The Umayyads, played a key role in incorporating domes into mosque architecture, drawing heavily from pre-Islamic Byzantine and Sassanian traditions. One of the earliest and most significant examples is the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, constructed in 691 AD by the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik. This structure was not a mosque but a shrine, yet it set a precedent for the use of domes in Islamic architecture, symbolizing the vault of heaven and the connection between the divine and earthly realms.

Initially, domes in mosques were modest in size and positioned above the mihrab, emphasizing their symbolic function as markers of spiritual focus.  As the Islamic empire expanded, architects incorporated techniques from different regions.

Persian and Byzantine influences

Whilst squinches and pendentives were not first used in mosques, they were later incorporated in dome design and were essential in transitioning from square rooms to circular domes. Squinches, which originated in Persian and Roman architecture, fill the corners of a square space to support a dome, while pendentives, a Byzantine innovation, allowed smooth transitions from a square base to a circular dome. These techniques are exemplified by the Dome of Soltaniyeh.

Domes in South Asian mosque architecture

Domes became a defining feature of South Asian mosque architecture during the Delhi Sultanate and reached their peak under the Mughal Empire. Influenced by Persian and Central Asian traditions, the Mughals introduced the iconic onion-shaped domes, seen in landmarks like the Jama Masjid in Delhi and the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore. These domes were not only visually striking but also represented remarkable engineering, using techniques such as iron dowels for strength and timber centering for precision. The Mughal architectural style still influences mosque design today.

Modern innovations

One prime example of modern innovation is the Masjid Raja Haji Fi Sabilillah in Malaysia, which features a Low-E (low emissivity) glass dome. The use of Low-E glass allows for significant energy efficiency by reducing heat gain while still allowing natural light to illuminate the interior space. This technique helps to maintain a comfortable temperature inside the mosque, minimizing reliance on air conditioning, and promoting sustainability.

===Ablution facilities===
As ritual purification precedes all prayers, mosques often have ablution fountains or other facilities for washing in their entryways or courtyards. Worshippers at much smaller mosques often have to use restrooms to perform their ablutions. In traditional mosques, this function is often elaborated into a freestanding building in the center of a courtyard. This desire for cleanliness extends to the prayer halls where shoes are disallowed to be worn anywhere other than the cloakroom. Thus, foyers with shelves to put shoes and racks to hold coats are commonplace among mosques.

===Contemporary features===
Modern mosques have a variety of amenities available to their congregants. As mosques are supposed to appeal to the community, they may also have additional facilities, from health clinics and clubs (gyms) to libraries to gymnasiums, to serve the community.

===Symbols===
Certain symbols are represented in a mosque&#x27;s architecture to allude to different aspects of the Islamic religion. One of these feature symbols is the spiral. The &quot;cosmic spiral&quot; found in designs and on minarets is a references to heaven as it has &quot;no beginning and no end&quot;. Mosques also often have floral patterns or images of fruit and vegetables. These are allusions to the paradise after death.

==Rules and etiquette==

===Prayer leading===
Appointment of a prayer leader is considered desirable, but not always obligatory. The permanent prayer leader (imam) must be a free honest individual and is authoritative in religious matters. In mosques constructed and maintained by the government, the prayer leader is appointed by the ruler; in private mosques, appointment is made by members of the congregation through majority voting. According to the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, the individual who built the mosque has a stronger claim to the title of imam, but this view is not shared by the other schools.

Leadership at prayer falls into three categories, depending on the type of prayer: five daily prayers, Friday prayer, or optional prayers. According to the Hanafi and Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, appointment of a prayer leader for Friday service is mandatory because otherwise the prayer is invalid. The Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali schools argue that the appointment is not necessary and the prayer is valid as long as it is performed in a congregation. A slave may lead a Friday prayer, but Muslim authorities disagree over whether the job can be done by a minor. An imam appointed to lead Friday prayers may also lead at the five daily prayers; Muslim scholars agree to the leader appointed for five daily services may lead the Friday service as well.

All Muslim authorities hold the consensus opinion that only men may lead prayer for men. Nevertheless, women prayer leaders are allowed to lead prayer in front of all-female congregations.

===Cleanliness===

All mosques have rules regarding cleanliness, as it is an essential part of the worshippers&#x27; experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as &quot;wudu&quot;. Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to be clean themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.

===Dress===
Islam requires that its adherents wear clothes that portray modesty. Men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not reveal the shape of the body. Likewise, it is recommended that women at a mosque wear loose clothing that covers to the wrists and ankles, and cover their heads with a &quot;Ḥijāb&quot; (), or other covering. Many Muslims, regardless of their ethnic background, wear Middle Eastern clothing associated with Arabic Islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques.

===Concentration===
As mosques are places of worship, those within the mosque are required to remain respectful to those in prayer. Loud talking within the mosque, as well as discussion of topics deemed disrespectful, is forbidden in areas where people are praying. In addition, it is disrespectful to walk in front of or otherwise disturb Muslims in prayer. The walls within the mosque have few items, except for possibly Islamic calligraphy, so Muslims in prayer are not distracted. Muslims are also discouraged from wearing clothing with distracting images and symbols so as not to divert the attention of those standing behind them during prayer. In many mosques, even the carpeted prayer area has no designs, its plainness helping worshippers to focus.

===Gender separation===

There is nothing written in the Qur&#x27;an about the issue of space in mosques and gender separation. Traditional rules have segregated women and men. By traditional rules, women are most often told to occupy the rows behind the men. In part, this was a practical matter as the traditional posture for prayerkneeling on the floor, head to the groundmade mixed-gender prayer uncomfortably revealing for many women and distracting for some men. Traditionalists try to argue that Muhammad preferred women to pray at home rather than at a mosque, and they cite a &quot;ḥadīth&quot; in which Muhammad supposedly said: &quot;The best mosques for women are the inner parts of their houses,&quot; although women were active participants in the mosque started by Muhammad. Muhammad told Muslims not to forbid women from entering mosques. They are allowed to go in. The second Sunni caliph &#x27;Umar at one time prohibited women from attending mosques especially at night because he feared they might be sexually harassed or assaulted by men, so he required them to pray at home. Sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women; for example, the governor of Mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women.

Many mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room. Mosques in South and Southeast Asia put men and women in separate rooms, as the divisions were built into them centuries ago. In nearly two-thirds of American mosques, women pray behind partitions or in separate areas, not in the main prayer hall; some mosques do not admit women at all due to the lack of space and the fact that some prayers, such as the Friday Jumuʻah, are mandatory for men but optional for women. Although there are sections exclusively for women and children, the Grand Mosque in Mecca is desegregated.

===Non-Muslim inclusion===
Under most interpretations of &quot;sharia&quot;, non-Muslims are permitted to enter mosques provided that they respect the place and the people inside it. A dissenting opinion and minority view is presented by followers of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, who argue that non-Muslims may not be allowed into mosques under any circumstances.

The Quran addresses the subject of non-Muslims, and particularly polytheists, in mosques in two verses in its ninth chapter, Sura At-Tawba. The seventeenth verse of the chapter prohibits those who &quot;join gods with Allah&quot;—polytheists—from maintaining mosques:
The twenty-eighth verse of the same chapter is more specific as it only considers polytheists in the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca:
According to Ahmad ibn Hanbal, these verses were followed to the letter at the times of Muhammad, when Jews and Christians, considered monotheists, were still allowed to &quot;Al-Masjid Al-Haram&quot;. The Umayyad caliph Umar II later forbade non-Muslims from entering mosques, and his ruling remains in practice in present-day Saudi Arabia. Today, the decision on whether non-Muslims should be allowed to enter mosques varies. With few exceptions, mosques in the Arabian Peninsula as well as Morocco do not allow entry to non-Muslims. For example, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca is one of only two mosques in Morocco currently open to non-Muslims.

There are many other mosques in the West and Islamic world which non-Muslims are welcome to enter. Most mosques in the United States, for example, report receiving non-Muslim visitors every month. Many mosques throughout the United States welcome non-Muslims as a sign of openness to the rest of the community as well as to encourage conversions to Islam.

In modern-day Saudi Arabia, the Grand Mosque and all of Mecca are open only to Muslims. Likewise, Al-Masjid Al-Nabawi and the city of Medina that surrounds it are also off-limits to those who do not practice Islam. For mosques in other areas, it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims, and if they have a legitimate reason. All entrants regardless of religious affiliation are expected to respect the rules and decorum for mosques.

In modern Turkey, non-Muslim tourists are allowed to enter any mosque, but there are some strict rules. Visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers; visitors are required to wear long trousers and not to wear shoes, women must cover their heads; visitors are not allowed to interrupt praying Muslims, especially by taking photos of them; no loud talk is allowed; and no references to other religions are allowed (no crosses on necklaces, no cross gestures, etc.) Similar rules apply to mosques in Malaysia, where larger mosques that are also tourist attractions (such as the Masjid Negara) provide robes and headscarves for visitors who are deemed inappropriately attired.

In certain times and places, non-Muslims were expected to behave a certain way in the vicinity of a mosque: in some Moroccan cities, Jews were required to remove their shoes when passing by a mosque; in 18th-century Egypt, Jews and Christians had to dismount before several mosques in veneration of their sanctity.

The association of the mosque with education remained one of its main characteristics throughout history, and the school became an indispensable appendage to the mosque. From the earliest days of Islam, the mosque was the center of the Muslim community, a place for prayer, meditation, religious instruction, political discussion, and a school. Anywhere Islam took hold, mosques were established, and basic religious and educational instruction began.

==Role in contemporary society==

===Political mobilization===

The late 20th century saw an increase in the number of mosques used for political purposes. While some governments in the Muslim world have attempted to limit the content of Friday sermons to strictly religious topics, there are also independent preachers who deliver &quot;khutbas&quot; that address social and political issues, often in emotionally charged terms. Common themes include social inequalities, necessity of jihad in the face of injustice, and the universal struggle between good and evil. In Islamic countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, political subjects are preached by imams at Friday congregations on a regular basis. Mosques often serve as meeting points for political opposition in times of crisis.

Countries with a minority Muslim population are more likely than Muslim-majority countries of the Greater Middle East to use mosques as a way to promote civic participation. Studies of US Muslims have consistently shown a positive correlation between mosque attendance and political involvement. Some of the research connects civic engagement specifically with mosque attendance for social and religious activities other than prayer. American mosques host voter registration and civic participation drives that promote involving Muslims, who are often first- or second-generation immigrants, in the political process. As a result of these efforts as well as attempts at mosques to keep Muslims informed about the issues facing the Muslim community, regular mosque attendants are more likely to participate in protests, sign petitions, and otherwise be involved in politics. Research on Muslim civic engagement in other Western countries &quot;is less conclusive but seems to indicate similar trends&quot;.

=== Political controversy ===

In the western world, and in the United States in particular, anti-Muslim sentiment and targeted domestic policy has created challenges for mosques and those looking to build them. There has been government and police surveillance of mosques in the US and local attempts to ban mosques and block constructions, despite data showing that in fact, most Americans oppose banning the building of mosques (79%) and the surveillance of U.S. mosques (63%) as shown in a 2018 study done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding.

Since 2017, Chinese authorities have destroyed or damaged two-thirds of the mosques in China&#x27;s Xinjiang province. Ningxia officials were notified on 3 August 2018 that the Weizhou Grand Mosque would be forcibly demolished because it had not received the proper permits before construction. Officials in the town said that the mosque had not been given proper building permits, because it is built in a Middle Eastern style and includes numerous domes and minarets. The residents of Weizhou alarmed each other through social media and finally stopped the mosque destruction by public demonstrations.

===Role in violent conflicts===
As they are considered important to the Muslim community, mosques, like other places of worship, can be at the heart of social conflicts. The Babri Mosque in India was the subject of such a conflict up until the early 1990s when it was demolished. Before a mutual solution could be devised, the mosque was destroyed on December 6, 1992, as the mosque was built by Babur allegedly on the site of a previous Hindu temple marking the birthplace of Rama. The controversy surrounded the mosque was directly linked to rioting in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) as well as bombings in 1993 that killed 257 people.

Bombings in February 2006 and June 2007 seriously damaged Iraq&#x27;s al-Askari Mosque and exacerbated existing tensions. Other mosque bombings in Iraq, both before and after the February 2006 bombing, have been part of the conflict between the country&#x27;s groups of Muslims. In June 2005, a suicide bombing killed at least 19 people at an Afghan Shia mosque near Jade Maivand. In April 2006, two explosions occurred at India&#x27;s Jama Masjid. Following the al-Askari Mosque bombing in Iraq, imams and other Islamic leaders used mosques and Friday prayers as vehicles to call for calm and peace in the midst of widespread violence.

A study 2005 indicated that while support for suicide bombings is not correlated with personal devotion to Islam among Palestinian Muslims, it is correlated with mosque attendance because &quot;participating in communal religious rituals of any kind likely encourages support for self-sacrificing behaviors that are done for the collective good.&quot;

Following the September 11 attacks, several American mosques were targeted in attacks ranging from simple vandalism to arson. Furthermore, the Jewish Defense League was suspected of plotting to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California. Similar attacks occurred throughout the United Kingdom following the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Outside the Western world, in June 2001, the Hassan Bek Mosque was the target of vandalism and attacks by hundreds of Israelis after a suicide bomber killed 19 people in a night club in Tel Aviv. Although mosquegoing is highly encouraged for men, it is permitted to stay at home when one feels at risk from Islamophobic persecution.

===Saudi influence===
Although the Saudi involvement in Sunni mosques around the world can be traced back to the 1960s, it was not until later in the 20th century that the government of Saudi Arabia became a large influence in foreign Sunni mosques. Beginning in the 1980s, the Saudi Arabian government began to finance the construction of Sunni mosques in countries around the world. An estimated US$45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government financing mosques and Sunni Islamic schools in foreign countries. &quot;Ain al-Yaqeen&quot;, a Saudi newspaper, reported in 2002 that Saudi funds may have contributed to building as many as 1,500 mosques and 2,000 other Islamic centers.

Saudi citizens have also contributed significantly to mosques in the Islamic world, especially in countries where they see Muslims as poor and oppressed. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, in 1992, mosques in war-torn Afghanistan saw many contributions from Saudi citizens. The King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California and the Islamic Cultural Center of Italy in Rome represent two of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s largest investments in foreign mosques as former Saudi king Fahd bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud contributed US$8 million and US$50 million to the two mosques, respectively.

<text>A molecular cloud—sometimes called a stellar nursery if star formation is occurring within—is a type of interstellar cloud of which the density and size permit absorption nebulae, the formation of molecules (most commonly molecular hydrogen, H2), and the formation of H II regions. This is in contrast to other areas of the interstellar medium that contain predominantly ionized gas.

Molecular hydrogen is difficult to detect by infrared and radio observations, so the molecule most often used to determine the presence of H2 is carbon monoxide (CO). The ratio between CO luminosity and H2 mass is thought to be constant, although there are reasons to doubt this assumption in observations of some other galaxies.

Within molecular clouds are regions with higher density, where much dust and many gas cores reside, called clumps. These clumps are the beginning of star formation if gravitational forces are sufficient to cause the dust and gas to collapse.

==Research and discovery==

The history pertaining to the discovery of molecular clouds is closely related to the development of radio astronomy and astrochemistry. During World War II, at a small gathering of scientists, Henk van de Hulst first reported he had calculated the neutral hydrogen atom should transmit a detectable radio signal. This discovery was an important step towards the research that would eventually lead to the detection of molecular clouds.

Once the war ended, and aware of the pioneering radio astronomical observations performed by Jansky and Reber in the US, the Dutch astronomers repurposed the dish-shaped antennas running along the Dutch coastline that were once used by the Germans as a warning radar system and modified into radio telescopes, initiating the search for the hydrogen signature in the depths of space.

The neutral hydrogen atom consists of a proton with an electron in its orbit. Both the proton and the electron have a spin property. When the spin state flips from a parallel condition to antiparallel, which contains less energy, the atom gets rid of the excess energy by radiating a spectral line at a frequency of 1420.405 MHz.

This frequency is generally known as the 21 cm line, referring to its wavelength in the radio band. The 21 cm line is the signature of HI and makes the gas detectable to astronomers back on earth. The discovery of the 21 cm line was the first step towards the technology that would allow astronomers to detect compounds and molecules in interstellar space.

In 1951, two research groups nearly simultaneously discovered radio emission from interstellar neutral hydrogen. Ewen and Purcell reported the detection of the 21-cm line in March, 1951. Using the radio telescope at the Kootwijk Observatory, Muller and Oort reported the detection of the hydrogen emission line in May of that same year. 
Once the 21-cm emission line was detected, radio astronomers began mapping the neutral hydrogen distribution of the Milky Way Galaxy. Van de Hulst, Muller, and Oort, aided by a team of astronomers from Australia, published the Leiden-Sydney map of neutral hydrogen in the galactic disk in 1958 on the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. This was the first neutral hydrogen map of the galactic disc and also the first map showing the spiral arm structure within it.

Following the work on atomic hydrogen detection by van de Hulst, Oort and others, astronomers began to regularly use radio telescopes, this time looking for interstellar molecules. In 1963 Alan Barrett and Sander Weinred at MIT found the emission line of OH in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. This was the first radio detection of an interstellar molecule at radio wavelengths. More interstellar OH detections quickly followed and in 1965, Harold Weaver and his team of radio astronomers at Berkeley, identified OH emissions lines coming from the direction of the Orion Nebula and in the constellation of Cassiopeia.

In 1968, Cheung, Rank, Townes, Thornton and Welch detected NH₃ inversion line radiation in interstellar space. A year later, Lewis Snyder and his colleagues found interstellar formaldehyde. Also in the same year George Carruthers managed to identify molecular hydrogen. The numerous detections of molecules in interstellar space would help pave the way to the discovery of molecular clouds in 1970. 

Hydrogen is the most abundant species of atom in molecular clouds, and under the right conditions it will form the H2 molecule. Despite its abundance, the detection of H2 proved difficult. Due to its symmetrical molecule, H2 molecules have a weak rotational and vibrational modes, making it virtually invisible to direct observation.

The solution to this problem came when Arno Penzias, Keith Jefferts, and Robert Wilson identified CO in the star-forming region in the Omega Nebula. Carbon monoxide is a lot easier to detect than H2 because of its rotational energy and asymmetrical structure. CO soon became the primary tracer of the clouds where star-formation occurs.

In 1970, Penzias and his team quickly detected CO in other locations close to the galactic center, including the giant molecular cloud identified as Sagittarius B2, 390 light years from the galactic center, making it the first detection of a molecular cloud in history. This team later would receive the Nobel prize of physics for their discovery of microwave emission from the Big Bang.

Due to their pivotal role, research about these structures have only increased over time. A paper published in 2022 reports over 10,000 molecular clouds detected since the discovery of Sagittarius B2.

==Occurrence==
Within the Milky Way, molecular gas clouds account for less than one percent of the volume of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet it is also the densest part of it. The bulk of the molecular gas is contained in a ring between from the center of the Milky Way (the Sun is about 8.5 kiloparsecs from the center). Large scale CO maps of the galaxy show that the position of this gas correlates with the spiral arms of the galaxy. That molecular gas occurs predominantly in the spiral arms suggests that molecular clouds must form and dissociate on a timescale shorter than 10 million years—the time it takes for material to pass through the arm region.
Perpendicularly to the plane of the galaxy, the molecular gas inhabits the narrow midplane of the galactic disc with a characteristic scale height, &quot;Z&quot;, of approximately 50 to 75 parsecs, much thinner than the warm atomic (&quot;Z &quot;from 130 to 400 parsecs) and warm ionized (&quot;Z &quot;around 1000 parsecs) gaseous components of the ISM. The exceptions to the ionized-gas distribution are H II regions, which are bubbles of hot ionized gas created in molecular clouds by the intense radiation given off by young massive stars; and as such they have approximately the same vertical distribution as the molecular gas.

This distribution of molecular gas is averaged out over large distances; however, the small scale distribution of the gas is highly irregular, with most of it concentrated in discrete clouds and cloud complexes.

== General structure and chemistry of molecular clouds ==
Molecular clouds typically have interstellar medium densities of 10 to 30 , and constitute approximately 50% of the total interstellar gas in a galaxy. Most of the gas is found in a molecular state. The visual boundaries of a molecular cloud is not where the cloud effectively ends, but where molecular gas changes to atomic gas in a fast transition, forming &quot;envelopes&quot; of mass, giving the impression of an edge to the cloud structure. The structure itself is generally irregular and filamentary.

Cosmic dust and ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars are key factors that determine not only gas and column density, but also the molecular composition of a cloud. The dust provides shielding to the molecular gas inside, preventing dissociation by the ultraviolet radiation. The dissociation caused by UV photons is the main mechanism for transforming molecular material back to the atomic state inside the cloud. Molecular content in a region of a molecular cloud can change rapidly due to variation in the radiation field and dust movement and disturbance. 

Most of the gas constituting a molecular cloud is molecular hydrogen, with carbon monoxide being the second most common compound. Molecular clouds also usually contain other elements and compounds. Astronomers have observed the presence of long chain compounds such as methanol, ethanol and benzene rings and their several hydrides. Large molecules known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have also been detected.

The density across a molecular cloud is fragmented and its regions can be generally categorized in clumps and cores. Clumps form the larger substructure of the cloud, having the average size of 1 pc. Clumps are the precursors of star clusters, though not every clump will eventually form stars. Cores are much smaller (by a factor of 10) and have higher densities. Cores are gravitationally bound and go through a collapse during star formation.

In astronomical terms, molecular clouds are short-lived structures that are either destroyed or go through major structural and chemical changes approximately 10 million years into their existence. Their short life span can be inferred from the range in age of young stars associated with them, of 10 to 20 million years, matching molecular clouds’ internal timescales.

Direct observation of T Tauri stars inside dark clouds and OB stars in star-forming regions match this predicted age span. The fact OB stars older than 10 million years don’t have a significant amount of cloud material about them, seems to suggest most of the cloud is dispersed after this time. The lack of large amounts of frozen molecules inside the clouds also suggest a short-lived structure. Some astronomers propose the molecules never froze in very large quantities due to turbulence and the fast transition between atomic and molecular gas.

== Cloud formation and destruction ==
Due to their short lifespan, it follows that molecular clouds are constantly being assembled and destroyed. By calculating the rate at which stars are forming in our galaxy, astronomers are able to suggest the amount of interstellar gas being collected into star-forming molecular clouds in our galaxy. The rate of mass being assembled into stars is approximately 3 &quot;M&quot;☉ per year. Only 2% of the mass of a molecular cloud is assembled into stars, giving the number of 150 &quot;M&quot;☉ of gas being assembled in molecular clouds in the Milky Way per year.

Two possible mechanisms for molecular cloud formation have been suggested by astronomers. Cloud growth by collision and gravitational instability in the gas layer spread throughout the galaxy. Models for the collision theory have shown it cannot be the main mechanism for cloud formation due to the very long timescale it would take to form a molecular cloud, beyond the average lifespan of such structures.

Gravitational instability is likely to be the main mechanism. Those regions with more gas will exert a greater gravitational force on their neighboring regions, and draw surrounding material. This extra material increases the density, increasing their gravitational attraction. Mathematical models of gravitational instability in the gas layer predict a formation time within the timescale for the estimated cloud formation time.

Once a molecular cloud assembles enough mass, the densest regions of the structure will start to collapse under gravity, creating star-forming clusters. This process is highly destructive to the cloud itself. Once stars are formed, they begin to ionize portions of the cloud around it due to their heat. The ionized gas then evaporates and is dispersed in formations called ‘champagne flows’. This process begins when approximately 2% of the mass of the cloud has been converted into stars. Stellar winds are also known to contribute to cloud dispersal. The cycle of cloud formation and destruction is closed when the gas dispersed by stars cools again and is pulled into new clouds by gravitational instability.

== Star formation ==
Star formation involves the collapse of the densest part of the molecular cloud, fragmenting the collapsed region in smaller clumps. These clumps aggregate more interstellar material, increasing in density by gravitational contraction. This process continues until the temperature reaches a point where the fusion of hydrogen can occur. The burning of hydrogen then generates enough heat to push against gravity, creating hydrostatic equilibrium. At this stage, a protostar is formed and it will continue to aggregate gas and dust from the cloud around it.

One of the most studied star formation regions is the Taurus molecular cloud due to its close proximity to earth (140 pc or 430 ly away), making it an excellent object to collect data about the relationship between molecular clouds and star formation. Embedded in the Taurus molecular cloud there are T Tauri stars. These are a class of variable stars in an early stage of stellar development and still gathering gas and dust from the cloud around them. Observation of star forming regions have helped astronomers develop theories about stellar evolution. Many O and B type stars have been observed in or very near molecular clouds. Since these star types belong to population I (some are less than 1 million years old), they cannot have moved far from their birth place. Many of these young stars are found embedded in cloud clusters, suggesting stars are formed inside it.

==Types of molecular cloud==

===Giant molecular clouds===


A vast assemblage of molecular gas that has more than 10 thousand times the mass of the Sun is called a giant molecular cloud (GMC). GMCs are around 15 to 600 light-years (5 to 200 parsecs) in diameter, with typical masses of 10 thousand to 10 million solar masses. Whereas the average density in the solar vicinity is one particle per cubic centimetre, the average volume density of a GMC is about ten to a thousand times higher. Although the Sun is much denser than a GMC, the volume of a GMC is so great that it contains much more mass than the Sun. The substructure of a GMC is a complex pattern of filaments, sheets, bubbles, and irregular clumps.

Filaments are truly ubiquitous in the molecular cloud. Dense molecular filaments will fragment into gravitationally bound cores, most of which will evolve into stars. Continuous accretion of gas, geometrical bending, and magnetic fields may control the detailed fragmentation manner of the filaments. In supercritical filaments, observations have revealed quasi-periodic chains of dense cores with spacing of 0.15 parsec comparable to the filament inner width. A substantial fraction of filaments contained prestellar and protostellar cores, supporting the important role of filaments in gravitationally bound core formation. Recent studies have suggested that filamentary structures in molecular clouds play a crucial role in the initial conditions of star formation and the origin of the stellar IMF.

The densest parts of the filaments and clumps are called molecular cores, while the densest molecular cores are called dense molecular cores and have densities in excess of 104 to 106 particles per cubic centimeter. Typical molecular cores are traced with CO and dense molecular cores are traced with ammonia. The concentration of dust within molecular cores is normally sufficient to block light from background stars so that they appear in silhouette as dark nebulae.

GMCs are so large that local ones can cover a significant fraction of a constellation; thus they are often referred to by the name of that constellation, e.g. the Orion molecular cloud (OMC) or the Taurus molecular cloud (TMC). These local GMCs are arrayed in a ring in the neighborhood of the Sun coinciding with the Gould Belt. The most massive collection of molecular clouds in the galaxy forms an asymmetrical ring about the galactic center at a radius of 120 parsecs; the largest component of this ring is the Sagittarius B2 complex. The Sagittarius region is chemically rich and is often used as an exemplar by astronomers searching for new molecules in interstellar space.

===Small molecular clouds===

Isolated gravitationally-bound small molecular clouds with masses less than a few hundred times that of the Sun are called Bok globules. The densest parts of small molecular clouds are equivalent to the molecular cores found in GMCs and are often included in the same studies.

===High-latitude diffuse molecular clouds===
In 1984 IRAS identified a new type of diffuse molecular cloud. These were diffuse filamentary clouds that are visible at high galactic latitudes. These clouds have a typical density of 30 particles per cubic centimetre.

<doc id="19897" wikidata="Q347215" url="?curid=19897" title="Minoru Yamasaki">
<text>was a Japanese-American architect, best known for designing the original World Trade Center in New York City and several other large-scale projects. Yamasaki was one of the most prominent architects of the 20th century. He and fellow architect Edward Durell Stone are generally considered to be the two master practitioners of &quot;New Formalism&quot;.

During his three-decade career, he and his firm designed over 250 buildings. His firm, Yamasaki &amp; Associates, closed on December 31, 2009.

==Early life and education==
Yamasaki was born on December 1, 1912, in Seattle, Washington, the son of John Tsunejiro Yamasaki and Hana Yamasaki, &quot;issei&quot; Japanese immigrants. The family later moved to Auburn, Washington, and he graduated from Garfield Senior High School in Seattle. He enrolled in the University of Washington program in architecture in 1929, and graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) in 1934. During his college years, he was strongly encouraged by faculty member Lionel Pries. He earned money to pay for his tuition by working at a salmon cannery in Alaska, working five summers and earning $50 a month, plus 25 cents an hour in overtime pay.

In part to escape anti-Japanese prejudice, he moved to Manhattan in 1934, with $40 and no job prospects. He wrapped dishes for an importing company until he found work as a draftsman and engineer. He enrolled at New York University for a master&#x27;s degree in architecture and got a job with the architecture firm Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon, designers of the Empire State Building. The firm helped Yamasaki avoid internment as a Japanese-American during World War II, and he himself sheltered his parents in New York City. Yamasaki was politically active during his early years, particularly in efforts to relocate Japanese Americans affected by the internment program in the United States during World War II.

After leaving Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon, Yamasaki worked briefly for Harrison &amp; Abramovitz and Raymond Loewy. During his time with Harrison &amp; Abramovitz, Yamasaki, a gifted watercolorist, also taught drawing at Columbia University.

In 1945, Yamasaki moved to Detroit, where he secured a position with Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls (SHG) as the chief designer. At the time, SHG was the oldest as well as one of the largest and most prestigious architectural firms in Detroit and the United States, with recently completed projects including Detroit landmarks such as the Penobscot and Guardian Buildings. Yamasaki left the firm in 1949, and started his own partnership. He worked from Birmingham and Troy, Michigan. One of the first projects he designed at his own firm was Ruhl&#x27;s Bakery at 7 Mile Road and Monica Street in Detroit.

== Career ==
=== Pruitt–Igoe and other early commissions ===

Yamasaki&#x27;s first major project was the Pruitt–Igoe public housing project in St. Louis in 1955. Despite his love of traditional Japanese design and ornamentation, the buildings of Pruitt–Igoe were stark, modernist concrete structures, severely constricted by a tight budget. The housing project soon experienced so many problems that it was demolished starting in 1972, less than twenty years after its completion. Its destruction would be considered by architectural historian Charles Jencks to be the symbolic end of modernist architecture.

In the 1950s, Yamasaki was commissioned by the Reynolds Company to design an aluminum-wrapped building in Southfield, Michigan, which would &quot;symbolize the auto industry&#x27;s past and future progress with aluminum.&quot; The three-story glass building wrapped in aluminum, known as the Reynolds Metals Company&#x27;s Great Lakes Sales Headquarters Building, was also supposed to reinforce the company&#x27;s main product and showcase its admirable characteristics of strength and beauty.

In 1955, he designed the &quot;sleek&quot; terminal at Lambert–St. Louis International Airport, which led to his 1959 commission to design the Dhahran International Airport in Saudi Arabia. The Dhahran International Airport terminal building was especially well received in Saudi Arabia and was featured on the one riyal bank note.

Yamasaki&#x27;s first widely-acclaimed design was the Pacific Science Center, with its iconic lacy and airy decorative arches. It was constructed by the City of Seattle for the 1962 Seattle World&#x27;s Fair. The building raised his public profile so much that he was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Yamasaki was a member of the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission, created in 1961 to restore the grand avenue in Washington, D.C., but he resigned after disagreements and disillusionment with the design by committee approach.

The campus for the University of Regina was designed in tandem with Yamasaki&#x27;s plan for Wascana Centre, a park built around Wascana Lake in Regina, Saskatchewan. The original campus design was approved in 1962. Yamasaki was awarded contracts to design the first three buildings: the Classroom Building, the Laboratory Building, and the Dr. John Archer Library, which were built between 1963 and 1967.

Yamasaki designed two notable synagogues, North Shore Congregation Israel in Glencoe, Illinois (1964), and Temple Beth El, in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (1973).

He designed a number of buildings on college campuses, including designs for Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, and a building in Waikiki, in Honolulu, Hawaii, between 1958 and 1968 as well as being commissioned to design buildings on the campus of Wayne State University in the 1950s and 1960s, including the McGregor Memorial Conference Center, the College of Education building and the Prentis Building and DeRoy Auditorium Complex. The buildings at Wayne State University incorporated many architectural motifs that would become characteristic elements in Yamasaki&#x27;s designs.

With regards to the McGregor Memorial Conference Center, this included placing the building on an elevated base or pedestal to emphasize its presence, repeated geometric patterns on the exterior facade of the building (many times these exterior design features were functional as well, providing structural support to the building). He also used exotic materials such as white marble tiles and columns, incorporated a skylight traversing the length of the building and made extensive use of the secondary space outside the building including constructing a plaza with reflecting pools, seating areas, greenery and sculptures. The College of Education building featured repeating gothic arches throughout the exterior of the building which were both ornamental but also provided structural support for the building.

=== World Trade Center ===

In 1962 Yamasaki and his firm were commissioned to design his most well-known project: the World Trade Center, with Emery Roth &amp; Sons serving as associate architects. The World Trade Center towers featured many innovative design elements to address many unique challenges at the site.

One particular design challenge related to the efficacy of the elevator system, which became unique in the world when it was first opened for service. Yamasaki employed the fastest elevators at the time, running at per minute. Instead of placing a traditional large cluster of full-height elevator shafts in the core of each tower, Yamasaki created the Twin Towers&#x27; &quot;Skylobby&quot; system. The Skylobby design created three separate, connected elevator systems which would serve different zones of the building, depending on which floor was chosen, saving approximately 70% of the space which would have been required for traditional shafts. The space saved was then used for additional office space. Internally, each office floor was a vast open space unimpeded by support columns, ready to be subdivided as the tenants might choose.

Other design challenges included anchoring the massively tall towers to the bedrock located about below lower Manhattan&#x27;s soft soil. Digging a large trench to the bedrock risked flooding from nearby New York Harbor. The solution employed by Yamasaki and his team of engineers was to use a slurry wall; digging very narrow trenches about wide and then filling these with a slurry (a mixture of clay and water) that was dense enough to keep the surrounding water out. Pipes were then lowered into the slurry trench and concrete was pumped in. The concrete, being more dense than the slurry, sank to the bottom of the trenches all the way down to the bedrock displacing the slurry to the surface, where it was drained away. This process was repeated around the entire perimeter of the site and reinforced with steel cables to create a watertight concrete bathtub surrounding the excavation site. This slurry wall system had only been employed a few times prior in the United States and never on such a large project.

A further design challenge was developing a wind-bracing system to keep the ultra tall but relatively lightweight steel and glass structures from swaying at their upper levels. Other contemporary modern skyscrapers had used centrally located cross-bracing systems located in the core of the interiors at the upper levels, but Yamasaki and structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan employed an exterior truss system; a network of vertical and horizontal structural elements on the exterior of the towers giving them structural support. This external structural support system also decreased the need for large internal pillars. The external truss support system and the unique elevator configuration created more rentable space in the World Trade Centers to satisfy the owner&#x27;s (The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey) massive demand for of office space.

The first of the towers was finished in 1970. Many of his buildings feature superficial details inspired by the pointed arches of Gothic architecture, and make use of extremely narrow vertical windows. This narrow-windowed style arose from his own personal fear of heights. After partnering with Emery Roth and Sons on the design of the World Trade Center, the collaboration continued with other projects including new buildings at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C.

Yamasaki designed the BOK Tower in Tulsa, Oklahoma with a similar design to the World Trade Center. It was completed in 1976 and was the tallest building in Oklahoma at the time.

=== Later years ===
After criticism of his dramatically cantilevered Rainier Tower (1977) in Seattle, Yamasaki became less adventurous in his designs during the last decade of his career.

In 1978, Yamasaki designed the Federal Reserve Bank tower in Richmond, Virginia. The work was designed with a similar external appearance as the World Trade Center complex, with its narrow fenestration, and stands at .

==Legacy==
Despite the many buildings he completed, Yamasaki&#x27;s reputation faded along with the overall decline of modernism towards the end of the 20th century. Two of his major projects, the Pruitt-Igoe public housing complex, and the original World Trade Center, shared the dubious symbolic distinction of being destroyed while recorded by live TV broadcasts. The World Trade Center towers were not well received by some commentators at the time of their debut, with noted &quot;New York Times&quot; architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable criticizing the towers as being &quot;pure technology, the lobbies are pure schmaltz and the impact on New York of 110-story buildings...is pure speculation&quot; with criticizing the gothic exterior branches at the lower levels as &quot;General Motors gothic&quot;. In many ways, these best-known works ran counter to Yamasaki&#x27;s own design principles, and he later regretted his reluctant acceptance of architectural compromises dictated by the clients of these projects. Several others of his buildings have also been demolished.

Yamasaki collaborated closely with structural engineers, including John Skilling, Leslie Robertson, Fazlur Rahman Khan, and Jack V. Christiansen, to produce some of his innovative architectural designs. He strived to achieve &quot;serenity, surprise, and delight&quot; in his humanistic modernist buildings and their surrounds.

Decades after his death, Yamasaki&#x27;s buildings and legacy would be re-assessed more sympathetically by some architectural critics. Several of his buildings have now been restored in accordance with his original designs, and his McGregor Memorial Conference Center was awarded National Historic Landmark status in 2015.

==Personal life==
Yamasaki was first married in 1941 to Teruko &quot;Teri&quot; Hirashiki. They had three children together: Carol, Taro, and Kim. They divorced in 1961 and Yamasaki married Peggy Watty. He and Watty divorced two years later, and Yamasaki married a third time briefly before remarrying Teruko in 1969. In a 1969 article in &quot;The Detroit News&quot; about the remarriage, Yamasaki said &quot;I&#x27;m just going to be nicer to her&quot;.

Yamasaki suffered from health problems for at least three decades, and ulcers caused surgical removal of much of his stomach in 1953. Over time, he endured several more operations on his stomach. His health was not improved by increasingly heavy drinking towards the end of his life. Yamasaki died of stomach cancer on February 6, 1986, at the age of 73.

Yamasaki was affectionately known as &quot;Yama&quot; among his friends and associates.

<doc id="19898" wikidata="Q26253" url="?curid=19898" title="Madeira">
<text>Madeira ( ; ), officially the Autonomous Region of Madeira (), is an autonomous region of Portugal. It is an archipelago situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, in the region of Macaronesia, just under north of the Canary Islands —Spain—, west of the Kingdom of Morocco and southwest of mainland Portugal. Madeira sits on the African Tectonic Plate, but is culturally, politically and ethnically associated with Europe, with its population predominantly descended from Portuguese settlers. Its population was 251,060 in 2021. The capital of Madeira is Funchal, on the main island&#x27;s south coast.

The archipelago includes the islands of Madeira, Porto Santo, and the Desertas, administered together with the separate archipelago of the Savage Islands. Roughly half of the population lives in Funchal. The region has political and administrative autonomy through the Administrative Political Statute of the Autonomous Region of Madeira provided for in the Portuguese Constitution. The region is an integral part of the European Union as an outermost region. Madeira generally has a mild/moderate subtropical climate with mediterranean summer droughts and winter rain. Many microclimates are found at different elevations.

Madeira, uninhabited at the time, was claimed by Portuguese sailors in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator in 1419 and settled after 1420. The archipelago is the first territorial discovery of the exploratory period of the Age of Discovery.

Madeira is a year-round resort, particularly for Portuguese, but also British (148,000 visits in 2021), and Germans (113,000). It is by far the most populous and densely populated Portuguese island. The region is noted for its Madeira wine, flora, and fauna, with its pre-historic laurel forest, classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The destination is certified by EarthCheck. The main harbour in Funchal has long been the leading Portuguese port in cruise ship dockings, an important stopover for Atlantic passenger cruises between Europe, the Caribbean and North Africa. In addition, the International Business Centre of Madeira, also known as the Madeira Free Trade Zone, was established in the 1980s. It includes (mainly tax-related) incentives.
==History==
===Ancient===
Plutarch in his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; (&quot;Sertorius&quot;, 75 AD) referring to the military commander Quintus Sertorius (d. 72 BC), relates that after his return to Cádiz, he met sailors who spoke of idyllic Atlantic islands: &quot;The islands are said to be two in number separated by a very narrow strait and lie from Africa. They are called the Isles of the Blessed.&quot;

Archaeological evidence suggests that the islands may have been visited by the Vikings sometime between 900 and 1030.

Accounts by Muhammad al-Idrisi state that the Mugharrarin (&quot;the adventurers&quot; – seafarers from Lisbon) came across an island where they found &quot;a huge quantity of sheep, the meat of which was bitter and inedible&quot; before going to the more inhabited Canary Islands, in Spain. This island, possibly Madeira or Hierro, must have been inhabited or previously visited by people for livestock to be present.

===Legend===
During the reign of King Edward III of England, lovers Robert Machim and Anna d&#x27;Arfet were said to have fled from England to France in 1346. Driven off course by a violent storm, their ship ran aground along the coast of an island that may have been Madeira. Later, this legend was the basis of the naming of the city of Machico on the island, in memory of the young lovers.

===European exploration===
Madeira appears in several medieval manuscripts, including the &quot;Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms&quot; from the early 14th century, the Medici-Laurentian Atlas from 1351, the &quot;Soleri Portolani&quot; from 1380 and 1385 and Corbitis Atlas from the late 14th century. These texts refer to Madeira as &quot;Lecmane&quot;, &quot;Lolegname,&quot; &quot;Legnami&quot; (the isle of wood), &quot;Puerto&quot; or Porto Santo, &quot;deserte&quot; or deserta, and &quot;desierta&quot;. It is widely accepted that knowledge of these Atlantic islands existed before their better-documented discovery and successful settlement by the Kingdom of Portugal.
In 1418, two captains, João Gonçalves Zarco and Tristão Vaz Teixeira, while exploring the African coast in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator, were driven off course by a storm to an island which they named (English: &quot;holy harbour&quot;) in gratitude for divine deliverance from a shipwreck.

The following year, Zarco and Vaz organised an expedition with Bartolomeu Perestrello. The trio travelled to the island of Porto Santo, claimed it on behalf of the Portuguese Crown, and established a settlement. The new settlers observed &quot;a heavy black cloud suspended to the southwest&quot; and upon investigation discovered the larger island they called ().

===Settlement===

The first Portuguese settlers began colonizing the islands around 1420 or 1425.

The three governors, knights of the Order of Christ and navigators: João Gonçalves Zarco, Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo, along with their respective families, became the first settlers of the archipelago divided by three captaincies (respectively and Funchal, Machico and Porto Santo). This colonization process began in 1425, by order of King João I, with people of modest means, some former prisoners of the Kingdom and a group of people from the lower nobility, including fishermen and peasant farmers who willingly left Portugal for a new life on the islands, a better one, they hoped, than was possible in a Portugal which had been ravaged by the Black Death, and where the best farmlands were strictly controlled by the nobility.

Initially, the settlers produced wheat for their own sustenance but later began to export wheat to mainland Portugal. In earlier times, fish and vegetables were the settlers&#x27; main means of subsistence.

Grain production began to fall and the ensuing crisis forced Henry the Navigator to order other commercial crops to be planted so that the islands could be profitable. These specialised plants, and their associated industrial technology, created one of the major revolutions on the islands and fuelled Portuguese industry. Following the introduction of the first water-driven sugar mill on Madeira, sugar production increased to over 6,000 &quot;arrobas&quot; (an &quot;arroba&quot; was equal to ) by 1455, using advisers from Sicily and financed by Genoese capital (Genoa acted as an integral part of the island economy until the 17th century). The accessibility of Madeira attracted Genoese and Flemish traders, who were keen to bypass Venetian monopolies.
Sugarcane production was the primary engine of the island&#x27;s economy, which quickly afforded the Funchal metropolis economic prosperity. The production of sugar cane attracted adventurers and merchants from all parts of Europe, especially Italians, Basques, Catalans, and Flemish. This meant that, in the second half of the fifteenth century, the city of Funchal became a mandatory port of call for European trade routes.

Slaves were used during the island&#x27;s period of sugar trade to cultivate sugar cane alongside paid workers, though slave owners were only a small minority of the Madeiran population, and those who did own slaves owned only a few. Slaves consisted of Guanches from the nearby Canary islands. Barbary corsairs from North Africa, who enslaved Europeans from ships and coastal communities throughout the Mediterranean region, captured 1,200 people in Porto Santo in 1617.

Until the first half of the sixteenth century, Madeira was one of the major sugar markets of the Atlantic. Apparently, it is in Madeira that, in the context of sugar production, slave labour was applied for the first time. The colonial system of sugar production was put into practice on the island of Madeira, on a much smaller scale, and later transferred, on a large scale, to other overseas production areas.

Sugar mills were gradually abandoned, with few remaining, which gave way to other markets in Madeira.

In the 17th century, as Portuguese sugar production was shifted to Brazil, São Tomé and Príncipe and elsewhere, Madeira&#x27;s most important commodity product became its wine. Sugar plantations were replaced by vineyards, originating in the so-called ‘Wine Culture’, which acquired international fame and provided the rise of a new social class, the Bourgeoisie.

With the increase of commercial treaties with England, important English merchants settled on the Island and, ultimately, controlled the increasingly important island wine trade. The English traders settled in the Funchal as of the seventeenth century, consolidating the markets from North America, the West Indies and England itself. The Madeira wine became very popular in the markets and it is also said to have been used in a toast during the Declaration of Independence by the Founding Fathers of the United States.

As a result of a high demand for the season, there was a need to prepare guides for visitors. The first tourist guide of Madeira appeared in 1850 and focused on elements of history, geology, flora, fauna and customs of the island. Regarding hotel infrastructures, the British and the Germans were the first to launch the Madeiran hotel chain. The historic Belmond Reid&#x27;s Palace opened in 1891 as the &quot;Reid&#x27;s New Hotel&quot; and is still open to this day.

The British first amicably occupied the island in 1801 whereafter Colonel William Henry Clinton became governor. A detachment of the 85th Regiment of Foot under Lieutenant-colonel James Willoughby Gordon garrisoned the island.
After the Peace of Amiens, British troops withdrew in 1802, only to reoccupy Madeira in 1807 until the end of the Peninsular War in 1814. In 1846 James Julius Wood wrote a series of seven sketches of the island. In 1856, British troops recovering from cholera, and widows and orphans of soldiers fallen in the Crimean War, were stationed in Funchal, Madeira.

===World War I===
During the Great War on 3 December 1916, a German U-boat, , captained by Max Valentiner, entered Funchal harbour on Madeira. &quot;U-38&quot; torpedoed and sank three ships, bringing the war to Portugal by extension. The ships sunk were:
* CS &quot;Dacia&quot; (), a British cable-laying vessel. &quot;Dacia&quot; had previously undertaken war work off the coast of Casablanca and Dakar. It was in the process of diverting the German South American cable into Brest, France.
* SS &quot;Kanguroo&quot; (), a French specialized &quot;heavy-lift&quot; transport.
* &quot;Surprise&quot; (), a French gunboat. Her commander and 34 crewmen (including 7 Portuguese) were killed.

After attacking the ships, &quot;U-38&quot; bombarded Funchal for two hours from a range of about . Batteries on Madeira returned fire and eventually forced &quot;U-38&quot; to withdraw.

On 12 December 1917, two German U-boats, &quot;SM U-156&quot; and &quot;SM U-157&quot; (captained by Max Valentiner), again bombarded Funchal. This time the attack lasted around 30 minutes. The U-boats fired 40 shells. There were three fatalities and 17 wounded; a number of houses and Santa Clara church were hit.

The last Austrian Emperor, Charles I, was exiled to Madeira after the war. Determined to prevent an attempt to restore Charles to the throne, the Council of Allied Powers agreed he could go into exile on Madeira because it was isolated in the Atlantic and easily guarded. He died there on 1 April 1922 and his coffin lies in a chapel of the Church of Our Lady of Monte.

==Geography==

The Madeira archipelago is located from the African coast, from the closest point in the European coast (the Portuguese town of Sagres, in Algarve) and from the capital of Portugal, Lisbon (approximately a one-and-a-half-hour flight). Madeira inhabits the extreme south of the Tore-Madeira Ridge, a bathymetric structure oriented along a north-northeast to south-southwest axis that extends for . This structure consists of long geomorphological relief that extends from the abyssal plain to ; its highest submersed point reaches a depth of about (around latitude 36°N). The origins of the Tore-Madeira Ridge are not clearly established, but may have resulted from a buckling of the lithosphere.

===Islands and islets===
* Madeira (), including Ilhéu de Agostinho, Ilhéu de São Lourenço, Ilhéu Mole (northwest); Total population: 262,456 (2011 Census).
* Porto Santo (), including Ilhéu de Baixo ou da Cal, Ilhéu de Ferro, Ilhéu das Cenouras, Ilhéu de Fora, Ilhéu de Cima; Total population: 5,483 (2011 Census).
* Desertas Islands (), including the three uninhabited islands: Deserta Grande Island, Bugio Island and Ilhéu de Chão.
* Savage Islands (), archipelago 280 km south-southeast of Madeira Island including three main uninhabited islands and 16 islets in two groups: the Northwest Group (Selvagem Grande Island, Ilhéu de Palheiro da Terra, Ilhéu de Palheiro do Mar) and the Southeast Group (Selvagem Pequena Island, Ilhéu Grande, Ilhéu Sul, Ilhéu Pequeno, Ilhéu Fora, Ilhéu Alto, Ilhéu Comprido, Ilhéu Redondo, Ilhéu Norte).
=== Peaks ===

The ten tallest peaks in Madeira exemplify the island&#x27;s diverse topography. Pico Ruivo is the highest at 1,862 metres. Madeira&#x27;s mountaintops offer panoramic vistas of rugged terrain and the Atlantic Ocean, attracting hikers and nature enthusiasts seeking stunning views and challenging trails.
====Madeira Island====


Madeira island is at the top of a massive shield volcano that rises about from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, on the Tore underwater mountain range. The volcano formed atop an east–west rift in the oceanic crust along the African Plate, beginning during the Miocene epoch (5 million years ago), continuing into the Pleistocene (700,000 years ago). This was followed by extensive erosion, producing two large amphitheatres opening southward in the central part of the island. Volcanic activity later resumed, producing scoria cones and lava flows atop the eroded shield. The most recent volcanic eruptions were on the west-central part of the island 6,500 years ago, creating more cinder cones and lava flows.

It is the largest island of the group with an area of , a length of (from Ponte de São Lourenço to Ponta do Pargo). It is approximately at its widest point (from Ponta da Cruz to Ponta de São Jorge), with a coastline of . It has a mountain ridge that extends along the centre of the island, reaching at its highest point (Pico Ruivo), staying below 200 metres along its eastern extent. The primitive volcanic foci responsible for the central mountainous area, consisted of the peaks: Ruivo (1,862 m), Torres (1,851 m), Arieiro (1,818 m), Cidrão (1,802 m), Cedro (1,759 m), Casado (1,725 m), Grande (1,657 m), Ferreiro (1,582 m). At the end of this eruptive phase, reefs encircled the island, its marine vestiges evident in a calcareous layer in the area of Lameiros, in São Vicente. Sea cliffs, such as Cabo Girão, valleys and ravines extend from this central spine, leaving the interior generally inaccessible. Daily life is concentrated in the many villages at the mouths of the ravines, through which the heavy autumn and winter rains travel to the sea.

===Climate===
Madeira has many different bioclimates. Based on differences in sun exposure, humidity, and annual mean temperature, clear variations distinguish north- and south-facing regions, as well as some islands. The islands are strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream and Canary Current, giving it mild to warm year-round temperatures. According to the Instituto de Meteorologia (IPMA), the average annual temperature at Funchal weather station is for the 1981–2010 period. Relief is a determinant factor on precipitation levels; areas such as the Madeira Natural Park can get as much as of precipitation a year. Madeira hosts lush laurel forests, while Porto Santo, a much flatter island, has a semiarid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;). In most winters snowfall occurs in the mountains.
==Flora and fauna==
===Endemic plant and animal species===

In the south, little is left of the indigenous subtropical rainforest that once covered the island (the original settlers set fires to clear the land for farming) and named it (&quot;madeira&quot; means &quot;wood&quot; in Portuguese). However, in the north, the valleys harbor native trees. These &quot;laurissilva&quot; forests, notably those on the northern slopes, are designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Madeira&#x27;s paleobotanical record reveals that &quot;laurissilva&quot; forest has existed for at least 1.8 million years. Critically endangered species such as the vine &quot;Jasminum azoricum&quot; and the rowan &quot;Sorbus maderensis&quot; are endemic. The Madeiran large white butterfly was an endemic subspecies of the large white that inhabited the &quot;laurissilva&quot; forests but has not been seen since 1977.
===Madeiran wall lizard===
=== Madeiran wolf spider ===
&quot;Hogna ingens&quot;, the Deserta Grande wolf spider, is endemic to the Madeira archipelago, specifically Deserta Grande Island. It is critically endangered. It is considered the largest member of its family. Restoration efforts are underway.

===Birds===
Three species of birds are endemic to Madeira: the Trocaz pigeon, the Madeira Chaffinch and the Madeira firecrest. In addition extinct species include the Madeiran scops owl, two rail species, &quot;Rallus adolfocaesaris&quot; and &quot;R. lowei&quot;, and two quail species, &quot;Coturnix lignorum&quot; and &quot;C. alabrevis&quot;, and the Madeiran wood pigeon, a subspecies of the common wood pigeon and which was last seen in the early 20th century.

A Great Auk bone is known from the Selvagens, suggesting this seabird visited at least sporadically.

===Mice===
Madeira is home to six species of brown mice, believed to be descendants of common European brown mice brought to the island by Vikings in the 9th century (or conceivably by 15th century Portuguese settlers), but diversified to the point where they cannot interbreed with their ancestral species or with one another. They have essentially the same genes, but rearranged to give different chromosome numbers: the ancestral species has 40 chromosomes, whereas the Madeira species have from 22 to 30. The deep valleys of Madeira are separated by high ground, and the different species of mice do not encounter each other.

==&quot;Levadas&quot;==
==Politics==
=== Political autonomy ===
Due to its distinct geography, economy, social and cultural situation, as well as the historical autonomic aspirations of the population, the Autonomous Regions of Madeira was established in 1976. Although it is a politico-administrative autonomous region, the Portuguese constitution specifies both a regional and national connection, obliging their administrations to maintain democratic principles and promote regional interests, while reinforcing national unity.

As defined by the Portuguese constitution and other laws, Madeira possesses its own political and administrative statute and has its own government. The branches of Government are the Regional Government and the Legislative Assembly, the latter elected by universal suffrage, using the D&#x27;Hondt method of proportional representation.

The president of the Regional Government is appointed by the Representative of the Republic according to the results of the election to the legislative assemblies.

The sovereignty of the Portuguese Republic is represented in Madeira by the Representative of the Republic, appointed by the President of the Republic on the advice of the Government of the Republic. The tasks of the Representative of the Republic are to sign and order the publication of regional legislative decrees and regional regulatory decrees or to exercise the right of veto over regional laws, should these laws be unconstitutional. Before the sixth amendment to the Portuguese Constitution passed in 2006, this responsibility was held by a more-powerful Minister of the Republic, who was proposed by the Government and appointed by the President.

=== Status within the European Union ===
Madeira is an Outermost Region (OMR) of the European Union, meaning that due to its geographical situation, it is entitled to derogation from some EU policies.

According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, both primary and secondary European Union law applies to Madeira, with possible derogations to take account of its &quot;structural social and economic situation (...) which is compounded by their remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development&quot;. An example of such derogation is seen in the approval of the International Business Centre of Madeira and other state aid policies to help the rum industry.

It forms part of the European Union customs area, the Schengen Area and the European Union Value Added Tax Area.

=== Foreign relations and defence ===

Foreign affairs and defence are the responsibility of the national government. The Madeira Military Zone is the Portuguese Army&#x27;s command for ground forces stationed in the islands, centering on the 3rd Garrison Regiment based at Funchal. The Navy tasks the patrol vessels &quot;Tejo&quot; and &quot;Mondego&quot; specifically to Madeira, as well as other vessels as required, in order to patrol Portugal&#x27;s large economic zone. To support search and rescue, the Portuguese Air Force maintains a staging base on Porto Santo Island incorporating detachments of C-295 aircraft and Merlin helicopters.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Administratively, Madeira is divided into fifty four parishes and eleven municipalities:

===Funchal===
==Population==
===Demographics===
===Diaspora===

Madeirans migrated to the United States, Venezuela, Brazil, Guyana, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa and Trinidad and Tobago. Madeiran immigrants in North America mostly clustered in New England and mid-Atlantic states, Toronto, Northern California, and Hawaii. The city of New Bedford is especially rich in Madeirans, hosting the Museum of Madeira Heritage. The annual Madeiran and Luso-American celebration, the Feast of the Blessed Sacrament, the world&#x27;s largest celebration of Madeiran heritage, regularly draws crowds of tens of thousands to the city&#x27;s Madeira Field.

In the 1846 famine, over 6,000 inhabitants migrated to British Guiana. In 1891 they numbered 4.3% of the population. In 1902 5,000 Portuguese people, mostly Madeirans, lived in Honolulu, Hawaii. By 1910 this grew to 21,000.

1849 saw an emigration of Protestant religious exiles from Madeira to the United States, by way of Trinidad and elsewhere in the West Indies. Most of them settled in Illinois with financial and physical aid of the American Protestant Society, headquartered in New York City. In the late 1830s physician and Presbyterian minister Reverend Robert Reid Kalley, from Scotland made a stop at Funchal, Madeira on his way to a mission in China, with his wife, so that she could recover from an illness. Kalley and his wife stayed on Madeira where he began preaching the Protestant gospel and converting islanders from Catholicism. Eventually, he was arrested and imprisoned for his religious conversion activities. Another Scottish missionary, William Hepburn Hewitson, took on Protestant ministerial activities in Madeira. By 1846, about 1,000 Protestant Madeirenses, who were discriminated against and the subjects of mob violence because of their religious conversions, chose to immigrate to Trinidad and elsewhere in the West Indies in answer a call for sugar plantation workers. The exiles did not fare well there. The tropical climate was unfamiliar and they found themselves in serious economic difficulties. By 1848, the American Protestant Society raised money and sent Rev. Manuel J. Gonsalves, a Baptist minister and a naturalized U.S. citizen from Madeira, to work with Rev. Arsénio da Silva, who had emigrated with the exiles from Madeira, to arrange to resettle those who wanted to come to the United States. Rev. da Silva died in early 1849. Later in 1849, Rev. Gonsalves was then charged with escorting the exiles from Trinidad to settle in Sangamon and Morgan counties in Illinois on land purchased with funds raised by the American Protestant Society. Accounts state that anywhere from 700 to 1,000 exiles came to the United States at this time.

Several large Madeiran communities continue around the world, including in the UK and Jersey. The Portuguese British community, made up mostly of Madeirans, celebrate Madeira Day.

In Venezuela the Madeiran Portuguese settled in cities such as Caracas and rural areas of the interior. According to figures from the 1990s, around 70% of the Portuguese diaspora in that country was made up of Madeirans and their descendants, initially dedicated to activities such as agriculture, but later, due to the lack of government support, the emigrants concentrated on commerce in the large Venezuelan cities. Among the companies founded by Madeirans are the supermarkets Central Madeirense, Excelsior Gama, Supermercados Unicasa and Automercados Plaza, and many renowned bakeries. A state in Venezuela called Portuguesa was named after its large Portuguese population.

===Immigration===
Madeira is part of the Schengen Area.

Due to its growing popularity, Madeira’s population has grown, reaching 253,259 in 2022, of whom the majority are locals. But Madeira has, for many years, witnessed a rising foreign population. As of 31 December 2022, immigrants in the region totaled 11,793 people, representing an increase of 13.3% compared to 2021. “Nationals from Venezuela (19.7%), the United Kingdom (11.8%), Germany (9.4%) and Brazil (9.2%) continue to represent the main foreign communities in the region”, according to the DREM (Madeira Statistics Department).

==Economy==
The gross domestic product (GDP) reached nearly 7 billion euros in 2023, accounting for 2.6% of Portugal&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita was of 27,370 euros or 73% of the EU27 average. The GDP per employee was 71% of the EU average.

Madeira embraced Bitcoin by implementing policies that exempt Bitcoin investors from paying personal income taxes in the region. Madeira Regional Government President Miguel Albuquerque confirmed the inauguration of a business hub focused solely on Bitcoin and related innovations. Speaking in a dialogue with Prince Filip Karađorđević of Serbia at Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023, he framed the move as a significant step toward technological advancements and international partnerships.

===Madeira International Business Center===

The Madeira International Business Center (MIBC) free trade zone has led to additional infrastructure, production shops and essential services for small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. MIBC comprises three sectors of investment: the Industrial Free Trade Zone, the International Shipping Register – MAR and International Services. Madeira&#x27;s tax regime has been approved by the European Commission as legal State Aid and its deadline was extended through 2027. MIBC was created formally in the 1980s as a tool of regional economic policy. It consists of (mainly tax) incentives, granted with the objective of attracting investment into Madeira.

Favorable operational and fiscal conditions were approved by the European Commission under Article 299 of the Treaty on European Union. The MIBC is integrated in the Portuguese and EU legal systems and is regulated and supervised by Portuguese and EU authorities in a transparent and stable business environment, clearly distinguished from so-called &quot;tax havens&quot; and &quot;offshore jurisdictions&quot;. In 2015, the EC authorized a state aid regime for companies incorporated between 2015 and 2020 and extended the regime of tax reductions through 2027. The tax regime is outlined in Article 36°-A of the Portuguese Tax Incentives Statute. Available data demonstrates that this programme aided the local labor market, through the creation of qualified jobs and for professionals who have returned to Madeira; increased productivity; expanded business tourism from the visits of investors and their clients and suppliers, and other sectors such as real estate. Telecommunications and other services benefit from a larger client base. Companies attracted by MIBC represent over 40% of revenue in terms of corporate income tax for the Government of Madeira and nearly 3.000 jobs. Salaries there are above average in comparison with the wages paid in other sectors.

=== Regional government ===

Madeira has been a significant recipient of European Union funding, totaling €2 billion. In 2012, it was reported that despite a population of just 250,000, the local administration owed some €6 billion. The Portuguese treasury (IGCP) assumed Madeira&#x27;s debt management between 2012 and 2015. The region works with the central government on a long-term plan to reduce debt levels and commercial debt stock. Moody&#x27;s noted that the region made significant fiscal consolidation efforts and that its tax revenue collection has improved. Tax revenues increased by 41% between 2012 and 2016, helping the region to reduce its deficit to operating revenue ratio to 10% in 2016 from 77% in 2013.

===Tourism===

Tourism is an important sector in the region&#x27;s economy, contributing 20% to the region&#x27;s GDP, providing support throughout the year for commercial, transport and other activities and constituting a significant market for local products. The share in Gross Value Added of hotels and restaurants (9%) also highlights this phenomenon. The island of Porto Santo, with its beach and its climate, is entirely devoted to tourism.

Visitors are mainly from Europe, with Portuguese, British, German and French tourists providing the main contingents (2021). The average annual occupancy rate was 60.3% in 2008, reaching its maximum in March and April, when it exceeds 70%.

==== Whale watching ====
Whale watching has become very popular in recent years. Many species of dolphins, such as common dolphin, spotted dolphin, striped dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, short-finned pilot whale, and whales such as Bryde&#x27;s whale, Sei whale, fin whale, sperm whale, beaked whales can be spotted near the coast or offshore.

==Sustainable development==
Electricity on Madeira is provided solely through EEM (Empresa de Electricidade da Madeira, SA, which holds a monopoly for the provision of electrical supply on the autonomous region) and consists largely of fossil fuels, but with a significant supply of seasonal hydroelectricity from the levada system, wind power and a small amount of solar. Energy production comes from conventional thermal and hydropower, as well as wind and solar energy. The Ribeira dos Soccoridos hydropower plant, rated at 15MW, utilises a pumped hydropower reservoir to recycle mountain water during the dry summer.

Battery technologies are being tested to minimise Madeira&#x27;s reliance on fossil fuel imports. Renault SA and EEM piloted the Sustainable Porto Santo—Smart Fossil Free Island project on Porto Santo to demonstrate how fossil fuels can be entirely replaced with renewable energy, using a 3.3 MWh battery. Madeira operates a 15 MW 1-hour lithium iron phosphate battery with black start capability.

In the first half of 2022, 33% of the electricity consumed on the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira was sourced from renewable energy, a milestone achieved through a collaborative initiative co-funded by the European Union (EU).

Central to this accomplishment are the centuries-old stone pipes known as levadas, spanning thousands of kilometers and dating back to the fifteenth century. These levadas efficiently transport rainwater from northern regions to the south, serving various purposes such as human consumption, agriculture, and electricity production.

The Socorridos hydroelectric power station, fueled by water conveyed through the levadas, stands as the island&#x27;s principal hydraulic system, providing power consistently throughout the year. A significant aspect of the EU-funded multi-million euro project involved enhancing water storage capacity, including the construction of a 5.4-kilometer tunnel and additional mountain tunnels, presenting formidable engineering challenges.

Wind power complements the system, facilitating the movement of stored water uphill during peak demand periods. The treated water serves dual purposes—human consumption and agriculture—while also functioning as a renewable energy source. Nuno Jorge Pereira, Water Production Director for Wood, Water, and Waste (ARM), elucidates the strategic use of water volumes to adapt to energy production levels.

This €34.7 million project, with €17.3 million co-financed by the European Cohesion Policy, not only mitigates concerns about drought but also earned acclaim as one of the best EU co-funded projects in the EGIOSTAR Awards.

The optimized Socorridos plant has notably alleviated water-related challenges for local farmers.

==Transport==
The islands have two airports, Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport and Porto Santo Airport, on the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo respectively. From Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport the most frequent flights are to Lisbon. There are also direct flights to over 30 other airports in Europe and nearby islands.

Transport between the two main islands is by plane, or ferries from the Porto Santo Line, the latter also carrying vehicles. Visiting the interior of the islands is now easy thanks to construction of the &quot;Vias Rápidas&quot;, major roads that cross the island. Modern roads reach all points of interest on the islands.

Funchal has an extensive public transportation system. Bus companies, including Horários do Funchal, which has been operating for over a hundred years, have regularly scheduled routes to all points of interest on the island.

==Culture==
===Music===
Folklore music in Madeira is widespread and mainly uses local musical instruments such as the machete, rajão, brinquinho and cavaquinho, which are used in traditional folkloric dances like the .

Emigrants from Madeira also influenced the creation of new musical instruments. In the 1880s, the ukulele was created, based on two small guitar-like instruments of Madeiran origin, the cavaquinho and the rajão. The ukulele was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and Cape Verde. Three immigrants in particular, Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, José do Espírito Santo, and Augusto Dias, are generally credited as the first ukulele makers. Two weeks after they disembarked from the &quot;SS Ravenscrag&quot; in late August 1879, the &quot;Hawaiian Gazette&quot; reported that &quot;Madeira Islanders recently arrived here, have been delighting the people with nightly street concerts.&quot;

===Cuisine===

Because of the geographic situation of Madeira in the Atlantic Ocean, the island has an abundance of fish of various kinds. The species that are consumed the most are espada (black scabbardfish), blue fin tuna, swordfish, white marlin, blue marlin, albacore, bigeye tuna, wahoo, spearfish, skipjack tuna and many others are found in the local dishes as they are found along the coast of Madeira. Espada is usually fried in a batter and accompanied by fried banana (Espada com banana) and sometimes a passionfruit sauce. Bacalhau is also popular, as it is in Mainland Portugal.

There are many different meat dishes on Madeira, one of the most popular being espetada. Espetada is traditionally made of large chunks of beef rubbed in garlic, salt and bay leaf and marinated for 4 to 6 hours in Madeira wine, red wine vinegar and olive oil then skewered onto a bay laurel stick and left to grill over smouldering wood chips. These are so integral a part of traditional eating habits that a special iron stand is available with a T-shaped end, each branch of the &quot;T&quot; having a slot in the middle to hold a brochette (espeto in Portuguese); a small plate is then placed underneath to collect the juices. The brochettes are very long and have a V-shaped blade in order to pierce the meat more easily. It is usually accompanied with the local bread called bolo do caco. A traditional holiday dish is &quot;Carne de Vinho e Alhos&quot;, which is most closely associated with the pig slaughter that was held a few weeks before Christmas. A big event, traditionally it was attended by everyone in the village. The dish is made of pork which marinates for three days in white wine, vinegar, salt, and pepper and is then cooked with small potatoes, sliced carrots, and turnip. Another common meat dish is “Picado&quot; – cubed beef cooked in a mushroom sauce and accompanied by fries.

Other popular dishes in Madeira include açorda, feijoada and carne de vinha d&#x27;alhos.

Traditional pastries in Madeira usually contain local ingredients, one of the most common being &quot;mel de cana&quot;, literally &quot;sugarcane honey&quot; (molasses). The traditional cake of Madeira is called &quot;Bolo de Mel&quot;, which translates as (Sugarcane) &quot;Honey Cake&quot; and according to custom, is never cut with a knife, but broken into pieces by hand. It is a rich and heavy cake. The cake commonly known as &quot;Madeira cake&quot; in England is named after Madeira wine.

Malasadas are a local confection which are mainly consumed during the Carnival of Madeira. Pastéis de nata, as in the rest of Portugal, are also very popular.

Milho frito is a popular dish in Madeira that is similar to the Italian dish polenta fritta. Açorda Madeirense is another popular local dish.

Madeira is known for the high quality of its cherimoya fruits. The Annona Festival is traditional and held annually in the parish of Faial. This event encourages the consumption of this fruit and its derivatives, such as liqueurs, puddings, ice cream and smoothies.

=== Beverages ===
Madeira wine is a fortified wine produced in the Madeira Islands; varieties may be sweet or dry. It has a history dating back to the Age of Exploration when Madeira was a standard port of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral grape spirits were added. However, wine producers of Madeira discovered, when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip, that the flavour of the wine had been transformed by exposure to heat and movement. Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process that involves heating the wine and deliberately exposing the wine to some levels of oxidation. Most countries limit the use of the term &quot;Madeira&quot; to those wines that come from the Madeira Islands, to which the European Union grants Protected designation of origin (PDO) status.
A local beer called Coral is produced by the Madeira Brewery, which dates from 1872. It has achieved 2 Monde Selection Grand Gold Medals, 24 Monde Selection Gold Medals and 2 Monde Selection Silver Medals. Other alcoholic drinks are also popular in Madeira, such as the locally created Poncha, Niquita, Pé de Cabra, Aniz, as well as Portuguese drinks such as Macieira Brandy, Licor Beirão.

Laranjada is a type of carbonated soft drink with an orange flavour, its name being derived from the Portuguese word &quot;laranja&quot; (&quot;orange&quot;). Launched in 1872 it was the first soft drink to be produced in Portugal, and remains very popular to the present day. Brisa drinks, a brand name, are also very popular and come in a range of flavours.

==Sports==


Football is the most popular sport in Madeira and the island was indeed the first place in Portugal to host a match, organised by British residents in 1875. The island is the birthplace of international star Cristiano Ronaldo and is home to two prominent teams, C.S. Marítimo and C.D. Nacional, the later of which he played youth football for before leaving to join Sporting CP.

As well as football, the island is also home to professional sports teams in basketball (CAB Madeira) and handball (Madeira Andebol SAD, who were runners up in the 2019 European Challenge Cup). Madeira was also the host of the 2003 World Handball Championship.

The Rally Vinho da Madeira is a rally race held annually since 1959, considered one of the biggest sporting events on the island It was part of the European Rally Championship from 1979 to 2012 and the Intercontinental Rally Challenge from 2006 to 2010.

Other popular sporting activities include golf at one of the island&#x27;s two courses (plus one on Porto Santo), surfing, scuba diving, and hiking.

==Sister Jurisdictions==
Madeira Island has the following sister jurisdictions:
: Aosta Valley, Italy (1987)

<text>The M16 rifle (officially designated Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16) is a family of assault rifles adapted from the ArmaLite AR-15 rifle for the United States military. The original M16 rifle was a 5.56×45mm automatic rifle with a 20-round magazine.

In 1964, the XM16E1 entered US military service as the M16 and in the following year was deployed for jungle warfare operations during the Vietnam War. In 1969, the M16A1 replaced the M14 rifle to become the US military&#x27;s standard service rifle. The M16A1 incorporated numerous modifications including a bolt-assist (&quot;forward-assist&quot;), chrome-plated bore, protective reinforcement around the magazine release, and revised flash hider.

In 1983, the US Marine Corps adopted the M16A2 rifle, and the US Army adopted it in 1986. The M16A2 fires the improved 5.56×45mm (M855/SS109) cartridge and has a newer adjustable rear sight, case deflector, heavy barrel, improved handguard, pistol grip, and buttstock, as well as a semi-auto and three-round burst fire selector. Adopted in July 1997, the M16A4 is the fourth generation of the M16 series. It is equipped with a removable carrying handle and quad Picatinny rail for mounting optics and other ancillary devices.

The M16 has also been widely adopted by other armed forces around the world. Total worldwide production of M16s is approximately 8 million, making it the most-produced firearm of its 5.56 mm caliber. The US military has largely replaced the M16 in frontline combat units with a shorter and lighter version, the M4 carbine. In April 2022, the U.S. Army selected the SIG MCX SPEAR as the winner of the Next Generation Squad Weapon Program to replace the M16/M4. The new rifle is designated XM7.

==History==
===Background===
In 1928, a U.S. Army &#x27;Caliber Board&#x27; conducted firing tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground and recommended transitioning to smaller caliber rounds, mentioning, in particular caliber. Largely in deference to tradition, this recommendation was ignored and the Army referred to the caliber as &quot;full-sized&quot; for the next 35 years. After World War II, the United States military started looking for a single automatic rifle to replace the M1 Garand, M1/M2 carbines, M1918 Browning automatic rifle, M3 &quot;Grease Gun&quot; and Thompson submachine gun. However, early experiments with select-fire versions of the M1 Garand proved disappointing. During the Korean War, the select-fire M2 carbine largely replaced the submachine gun in US service and became the most widely used carbine variant. However, combat experience suggested that the .30 carbine round was underpowered. American weapons designers concluded that an intermediate round was necessary, and recommended a small-caliber, high-velocity cartridge.

However, senior American commanders, having faced fanatical enemies and experienced major logistical problems during World War II and the Korean War, insisted that a single, powerful .30 caliber cartridge be developed, that could not only be used by the new automatic rifle but by the new general-purpose machine gun (GPMG) in concurrent development. This culminated in the development of the 7.62×51 mm NATO cartridge.

The U.S. Army then began testing several rifles to replace the obsolete M1. Springfield Armory&#x27;s T44E4 and heavier T44E5 were essentially updated versions of the M1 chambered for the new 7.62 mm round, while Fabrique Nationale submitted their FN FAL as the T48. ArmaLite entered the competition late, hurriedly submitting several AR-10 prototype rifles in the fall of 1956 to the U.S. Army&#x27;s Springfield Armory for testing. The AR-10 featured an innovative straight-line barrel/stock design, forged aluminum alloy receivers, and with phenolic composite stocks. It had rugged elevated sights, an oversized aluminum flash suppressor and recoil compensator, and an adjustable gas system. The final prototype featured an upper and lower receiver with the now-familiar hinge and takedown pins, and the charging handle was on top of the receiver placed inside of the carry handle. For a 7.62 mm NATO rifle, the AR-10 was incredibly lightweight at only empty. Initial comments by Springfield Armory test staff were favorable, and some testers commented that the AR-10 was the best lightweight automatic rifle ever tested by the Armory. In the end, the U.S. Army chose the T44, now named the M14 rifle, which was an improved M1 Garand with a 20-round magazine and automatic fire capability. The U.S. also adopted the M60 general-purpose machine gun (GPMG). Its NATO partners adopted the FN FAL and HK G3 rifles, as well as the FN MAG and Rheinmetall MG3 GPMGs.

The first confrontations between the AK-47 and the M14 came in the early part of the Vietnam War. Battlefield reports indicated that the M14 was uncontrollable in full-auto and that soldiers could not carry enough ammunition to maintain fire superiority over the AK-47. And, while the M2 carbine offered a high rate of fire, it was under-powered and ultimately outclassed by the AK-47. A replacement was needed: a medium between the traditional preference for high-powered rifles such as the M14, and the lightweight firepower of the M2 carbine.

As a result, the Army was forced to reconsider a 1957 request by General Willard G. Wyman, commander of the U.S. Continental Army Command (CONARC) to develop a .223-inch caliber (5.56 mm) select-fire rifle weighing when loaded with a 20-round magazine. The 5.56 mm round had to penetrate a standard U.S. helmet at and retain a velocity over the speed of sound while matching or exceeding the wounding ability of the .30 carbine cartridge.

This request ultimately resulted in the development of a scaled-down version of the Armalite AR-10, named the ArmaLite AR-15. The AR-15 was first revealed by Eugene Stoner at Fort Benning in May 1957. The AR-15 used .22-caliber bullets, which destabilized when they hit a human body, as opposed to the .30 round, which typically passed through in a straight line. The smaller caliber meant that it could be controlled in autofire due to the reduced bolt thrust and free recoil impulse. Being almost one-third the weight of the .30 meant that the soldier could sustain fire for longer with the same load. Due to design innovations, the AR-15 could fire 600 to 700 rounds a minute with an extremely low jamming rate. Parts were stamped out, not hand-machined, so they could be mass-produced, and the stock was plastic to reduce weight.

In 1958, the Army&#x27;s Combat Developments Experimentation Command ran experiments with small squads in combat situations using the M14, AR-15, and Winchester&#x27;s Light Weight Military Rifle (WLWMR). The resulting study recommended adopting a lightweight rifle like the AR-15. In response, the Army declared that all rifles and machine guns should use the same ammunition and ordered full production of the M14. However, advocates for the AR-15 gained the attention of Air Force Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay. After testing the AR-15 with the ammunition manufactured by Remington that Armalite and Colt recommended, the Air Force declared that the AR-15 was its &#x27;standard model&#x27; and ordered 8,500 rifles and 8.5 million rounds. Advocates for the AR-15 in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency acquired 1,000 Air Force AR-15s and shipped them to be tested by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). The South Vietnam soldiers issued glowing reports of the weapon&#x27;s reliability, recording zero broken parts while firing 80,000 rounds in one stage of testing, and requiring only two replacement parts for the 1,000 weapons over the entire course of testing. The report of the experiment recommended that the U.S. provide the AR-15 as the standard rifle of the ARVN, but Admiral Harry Felt, then Commander in Chief of Pacific Forces, rejected the recommendations on the advice of the U.S. Army.

Throughout 1962 and 1963, the U.S. military extensively tested the AR-15. Positive evaluations emphasized its lightness, &quot;lethality&quot;, and reliability. However, the Army Materiel Command criticized its inaccuracy at longer ranges and lack of penetrating power at higher ranges. In early 1963, the U.S. Special Forces asked and was given permission, to make the AR-15 its standard weapon. Other users included Army Airborne units in Vietnam and some units affiliated with the Central Intelligence Agency. As more units adopted the AR-15, Secretary of the Army Cyrus Vance ordered an investigation into why the weapon had been rejected by the Army. The resulting report found that Army Materiel Command had rigged the previous tests, selecting tests that would favor the M14 and choosing match grade M14s to compete against AR-15s out of the box. At this point, the bureaucratic battle lines were well-defined, with the Army ordnance agencies opposed to the AR-15 and the Air Force and civilian leadership of the Defense Department in favor.

In January 1963, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara concluded that the AR-15 was the superior weapon system and ordered a halt to M14 production. In late 1963, the Defense Department began mass procurement of rifles for the Air Force and special Army units. Secretary McNamara designated the Army as the procurer for the weapon with the Department, which allowed the Army ordnance establishment to modify the weapon as they wished. The first modification was the addition of a &quot;manual bolt closure&quot;, allowing a soldier to ram in a round if it failed to seat properly. The Air Force, which was buying the rifle, and the Marine Corps, which had tested it both objected to this addition, with the Air Force noting, &quot;During three years of testing and operation of the AR-15 rifle under all types of conditions the Air Force has no record of malfunctions that could have been corrected by a manual bolt closing device.&quot; They also noted that the closure added weight and complexity, reducing the reliability of the weapon. Colonel Harold Yount, who managed the Army procurement, would later state the bolt closure was added after direction from senior leadership, rather than as a result of any complaint or test result, and testified about the reasons: &quot;the M-1, the M-14, and the carbine had always had something for the soldier to push on; that maybe this would be a comforting feeling to him or something.&quot;

After modifications, the new redesigned rifle was subsequently adopted as the M16 Rifle:
Despite its early failures the M16 proved to be a revolutionary design and stands as the longest continuously serving rifle in US military history. It has been adopted by many US allies and the 5.56×45 mm NATO cartridge has become not only the NATO standard but &quot;the standard assault-rifle cartridge in much of the world.&quot; It also led to the development of small-caliber high-velocity service rifles by every major army in the world. It is a benchmark against which other assault rifles are judged.

===Adoption===

In July 1960, General Curtis LeMay was impressed by a demonstration of the ArmaLite AR-15. In the summer of 1961, General LeMay was promoted to U.S. Air Force chief of staff and requested 80,000 AR-15s. However, General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advised President John F. Kennedy that having two different calibers within the military system at the same time would be problematic and the request was rejected. In October 1961, William Godel, a senior man at the Advanced Research Projects Agency, sent 10 AR-15s to South Vietnam. The reception was enthusiastic, and in 1962 another 1,000 AR-15s were sent. United States Army Special Forces personnel filed battlefield reports lavishly praising the AR-15 and the stopping power of the 5.56 mm cartridge, and pressed for its adoption.

The damage caused by the 5.56 mm bullet was originally believed to be caused by &quot;tumbling&quot; due to the slow 1 turn in rifling twist rate. However, any pointed lead core bullet will &quot;tumble&quot; after penetration into flesh, because the center of gravity is towards the rear of the bullet. The large wounds observed by soldiers in Vietnam were caused by bullet fragmentation created by a combination of the bullet&#x27;s velocity and construction. These wounds were so devastating that the photographs remained classified into the 1980s.

However, despite overwhelming evidence that the AR-15 could bring more firepower to bear than the M14, the Army opposed the adoption of the new rifle. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara now had two conflicting views: the ARPA report favoring the AR-15 and the Army&#x27;s position favoring the M14. Even President Kennedy expressed concern, so McNamara ordered Secretary of the Army, Cyrus Vance, to test the M14, the AR-15, and the AK-47. The Army reported that only the M14 was suitable for service, but Vance wondered about the impartiality of those conducting the tests. He ordered the Army Inspector General to investigate the testing methods used; the inspector general confirmed that the testers were biased toward the M14.

In January 1963, Secretary McNamara received reports that M14 production was insufficient to meet the needs of the armed forces and ordered a halt to M14 production. At the time, the AR-15 was the only rifle that could fulfill a requirement of a &quot;universal&quot; infantry weapon for issue to all services. McNamara ordered its adoption, despite receiving reports of several deficiencies, most notably the lack of a chrome-plated chamber.

After modifications (most notably, the charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle like the AR-10, to the rear of the receiver), the newly redesigned rifle was renamed the &quot;Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16&quot;. Inexplicably, the modification to the new M16 did not include a chrome-plated barrel. Meanwhile, the Army relented and recommended the adoption of the M16 for jungle warfare operations. However, the Army insisted on the inclusion of a forward assist to help push the bolt into battery if a cartridge failed to seat into the chamber. The Air Force, Colt, and Eugene Stoner believed that the addition of a forward assist was an unjustified expense. As a result, the design was split into two variants: the Air Force&#x27;s M16 without the forward assist, and the XM16E1 with the forward assist for the other service branches.

In November 1963, McNamara approved the U.S. Army&#x27;s order of 85,000 XM16E1s; and to appease General LeMay, the Air Force was granted an order for another 19,000 M16s. In March 1964, the M16 rifle went into production and the Army accepted delivery of the first batch of 2,129 rifles later that year, and an additional 57,240 rifles the following year.

In 1964, the Army was informed that DuPont could not mass-produce the IMR 4475 stick powder to the specifications demanded by the M16. Therefore, Olin Mathieson Company provided a high-performance ball propellant. While the Olin WC 846 powder achieved the desired per second muzzle velocity, it produced much more fouling, which quickly jammed the M16&#x27;s action (unless the rifle was cleaned well and often).

In March 1965, the Army began to issue the XM16E1 to infantry units. However, the rifle was initially delivered without adequate cleaning kits or instructions because advertising from Colt asserted that the M16&#x27;s materials made the weapon require little maintenance, leading to a misconception that it was capable of self-cleaning. Furthermore, cleaning was often conducted with improper equipment, such as insect repellent, water, and aircraft fuel, which induced further wear on the weapon. As a result, reports of stoppages in combat began to surface. The most severe problem was known as &quot;failure to extract&quot;—the spent cartridge case remained lodged in the chamber after the rifle was fired. Documented accounts of dead U.S. troops found next to disassembled rifles eventually led to a Congressional investigation:

In February 1967, the improved XM16E1 was standardized as the M16A1. The new rifle had a chrome-plated chamber and bore to eliminate corrosion and stuck cartridges, and other minor modifications. New cleaning kits, powder solvents, and lubricants were also issued. Intensive training programs in weapons cleaning were instituted including a comic book-style operations manual. As a result, reliability problems were largely resolved and the M16A1 rifle achieved widespread acceptance by U.S. troops in Vietnam.

In 1969, the M16A1 officially replaced the M14 rifle to become the U.S. military&#x27;s standard service rifle. In 1970, the new WC 844 powder was introduced to reduce fouling.

Colt, H&amp;R, and GM Hydramatic Division manufactured M16A1 rifles during the Vietnam War. M16s were produced by Colt until the late 1980s when FN Herstal (FN USA) began to manufacture them.

==Reliability==

During the early part of its service, the M16 had a reputation for poor reliability and a malfunction rate of two per 1000 rounds fired. The M16&#x27;s action works by passing high-pressure propellant gasses, tapped from the barrel, down a tube and into the carrier group within the upper receiver. The gas goes from the gas tube, through the bolt carrier key, and into the inside of the carrier where it expands in a donut-shaped gas-piston cylinder. Because the bolt is prevented from moving forward by the barrel, the carrier is driven to the rear by the expanding gases and thus converts the energy of the gas to the movement of the rifle&#x27;s parts. The back part of the bolt forms a piston head and the cavity in the bolt carrier is the piston sleeve. While the M16 is commonly said to use a direct impingement system, this is wrong, and it is instead correct to say it uses an &quot;internal piston&quot; system. This system is however ammunition specific, since it does not have an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the weapon to various propellant and projectile or barrel length specific pressure behavior.

The M16 operating system designed by Stoner is lighter and more compact than a gas-piston design. However, this design requires that combustion byproducts from the discharged cartridge be blown into the receiver as well. This accumulating carbon and vaporized metal build-up within the receiver and bolt carrier negatively affects reliability and necessitates more intensive maintenance on the part of the individual soldier. The channeling of gasses into the bolt carrier during operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing the M16 and causes the essential lubricant to be &quot;burned off&quot;. This requires frequent and generous applications of appropriate lubricant. Lack of proper lubrication is the most common source of weapon stoppages or jams.

The original M16 fared poorly in the jungles of Vietnam and was infamous for reliability problems in harsh environments. Max Hastings was very critical of the M16&#x27;s general field issue in Vietnam just as grievous design flaws were becoming apparent. He further states that the &quot;Shooting Times&quot; experienced repeated malfunctions with a test M16 and assumed these would be corrected before military use, but they were not. Many marines and soldiers were so angry with the reliability problems they began writing home and on 26 March 1967, the &quot;Washington Daily News&quot; broke the story. Eventually, the M16 became the target of a congressional investigation.

The investigation found that:
* The M16 was issued to troops without cleaning kits or instructions on how to clean the rifle.
* The M16 and 5.56×45mm cartridge was tested and approved with the use of a DuPont IMR8208M extruded powder, which was switched to Olin Mathieson WC846 ball powder which produced much more fouling, which quickly jammed the action of the M16 (unless the gun was cleaned well and often).
* The M16 lacked a forward assist (rendering the rifle inoperable when it failed to go fully forward).
* The M16 lacked a chrome-plated chamber, which allowed corrosion problems and contributed to case-extraction failures (which was considered the most severe problem and required extreme measures to clear, such as inserting the cleaning rod down the barrel and knocking the spent cartridge out).
When these issues were addressed and corrected by the M16A1, the reliability problems decreased greatly. According to a 1968 Department of Army report, the M16A1 rifle achieved widespread acceptance by U.S. troops in Vietnam. &quot;Most men armed with the M16 in Vietnam rated this rifle&#x27;s performance high, however, many men entertained some misgivings about the M16&#x27;s reliability. When asked what weapon they preferred to carry in combat, 85 percent indicated that they wanted either the M16 or its [smaller] carbine-length version, the XM177E2.&quot; Also, &quot;the M14 was preferred by 15 percent, while less than one percent wished to carry either the Stoner rifle, the AK-47, the [M1] carbine or a pistol.&quot; In March 1970, the &quot;President&#x27;s Blue Ribbon Defense Panel&quot; concluded that the issuance of the M16 saved the lives of 20,000 U.S. servicemen during the Vietnam War, who would have otherwise died had the M14 remained in service. However, the M16 rifle&#x27;s reputation has suffered as of 2011.

Another underlying cause of the M16&#x27;s jamming problem was identified by ordnance staff that discovered that Stoner and ammunition manufacturers had initially tested the AR-15 using DuPont IMR8208M extruded (stick) powder. Later ammunition manufacturers adopted the more readily available Olin Mathieson WC846 ball powder. The ball powder produced a longer peak chamber pressure with undesired timing effects. Upon firing, the cartridge case expands and seals the chamber (obturation). When the peak pressure starts to drop the cartridge case contracts and then can be extracted. With ball powder, the cartridge case was not contracted enough during extraction due to the longer peak pressure period. The ejector would then fail to extract the cartridge case, tearing through the case rim, and leaving an obturated case behind.

After the introduction of the M4 carbine, it was found that the shorter barrel length of 14.5 inches also harms the reliability, as the gas port is located closer to the chamber than the gas port of the standard length M16 rifle: 7.5 inches instead of 13 inches. This affects the M4&#x27;s timing and increases the amount of stress and heat on the critical components, thereby reducing reliability. In a 2002 assessment, the USMC found that the M4 malfunctioned three times more often than the M16A4 (the M4 failed 186 times for 69,000 rounds fired, while the M16A4 failed 61 times). Thereafter, the Army and Colt worked to make modifications to the M4s and M16A4s to address the problems found. In tests conducted in 2005 and 2006 the Army found that on average, the new M4s and M16s fired approximately 5,000 rounds between stoppages.

In December 2006, the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) released a report on U.S. small arms in combat. The CNA conducted surveys on 2,608 troops returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 12 months. Only troops who had fired their weapons at enemy targets were allowed to participate. 1,188 troops were armed with M16A2 or A4 rifles, making up 46 percent of the survey. 75 percent of M16 users (891 troops) reported they were satisfied with the weapon. 60 percent (713 troops) were satisfied with handling qualities such as handguards, size, and weight. Of the 40 percent dissatisfied, most were with its size. Only 19 percent of M16 users (226 troops) reported a stoppage, while 80 percent of those that experienced a stoppage said it had little impact on their ability to clear the stoppage and re-engage their target. Half of the M16 users experienced failures in their magazines to feed. 83 percent (986 troops) did not need their rifles repaired while in the theater. 71 percent (843 troops) were confident in the M16&#x27;s reliability, defined as a level of soldier confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction, and 72 percent (855 troops) were confident in its durability, defined as a level of soldier confidence their weapon will not break or need repair. Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their maintenance. 60 percent of M16 users offered recommendations for improvements. Requests included greater bullet lethality, newly built instead of rebuilt rifles, better-quality magazines, decreased weight, and a collapsible stock. Some users recommended shorter and lighter weapons such as the M4 carbine. Some issues have been addressed with the issuing of the Improved STANAG magazine in March 2009, and the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round in June 2010.

In early 2010, two journalists from &quot;The New York Times&quot; spent three months with soldiers and Marines in Afghanistan. While there, they questioned around 100 infantry troops about the reliability of their M16 rifles, as well as the M4 carbine. The troops did not report reliability problems with their rifles. While only 100 troops were asked, they engaged in daily fighting in Marja, including at least a dozen intense engagements in Helmand Province, where the ground is covered in fine powdered sand (called &quot;moon dust&quot; by troops) that can stick to firearms. Weapons were often dusty, wet, and covered in mud. Intense firefights lasted hours with several magazines being expended. Only one soldier reported a jam when his M16 was covered in mud after climbing out of a canal. The weapon was cleared and resumed firing with the next chambered round. Furthermore, the Marine Chief Warrant Officer responsible for weapons training and performance of the Third Battalion, Sixth Marines, reported that &quot;We&#x27;ve had nil in the way of problems; we&#x27;ve had no issues&quot;, with his battalion&#x27;s 350 M16s and 700 M4s.

==Design==

The M16 is a lightweight, 5.56 mm, air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed assault rifle, with a rotating bolt. The M16&#x27;s receivers are made of 7075 aluminum alloy, its barrel, bolt, and bolt carrier of steel, and its handguards, pistol grip, and buttstock of plastics.

The M16 internal piston action was derived from the original ArmaLite AR-10 and ArmaLite AR-15 actions. This internal piston action system designed by Eugene Stoner is commonly called a direct impingement system, but it does not use a conventional direct impingement system. In , the designer states: ″This invention is a true expanding gas system instead of the conventional impinging gas system.″ The gas system, bolt carrier, and bolt-locking design is ammunition specific, since it does not have an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the weapon to various propellant and projectile or barrel length specific pressure behavior.

The M16A1 was especially lightweight at with a loaded 30-round magazine. This was significantly less than the M14 that it replaced at with a loaded 20-round magazine. It is also lighter when compared to the AKM&#x27;s with a loaded 30-round magazine.

The M16A2 weighs loaded with a 30-round magazine, because of the adoption of a thicker barrel profile. The thicker barrel is more resistant to damage when handled roughly and is also slower to overheat during sustained fire. Unlike a traditional &quot;bull&quot; barrel that is thick its entire length, the M16A2&#x27;s barrel is only thick forward of the handguards. The barrel profile under the handguards remained the same as the M16A1 for compatibility with the M203 grenade launcher.

===Barrel===
Early model M16 barrels had a rifling twist of four grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 14 inches (1:355.6 mm or 64 calibers) bore—as it was the same rifling as used by the .222 Remington sporting cartridge. After finding out that under unfavorable conditions, military bullets could yaw in flight at long ranges, the rifling was soon altered. Later M16 models and the M16A1 had an improved rifling with six grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 12 inches (1:304.8 mm or 54.8 calibers) for increased accuracy and was optimized to adequately stabilize the M193 ball and M196 tracer bullets. M16A2 and current models are optimized for firing the heavier NATO SS109 ball and long L110 tracer bullets and have six grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 7 in (1:177.8 mm or 32 calibers).

M193 ball and M196 tracer bullets may be fired in a rifle with a one turn in 7 in (1:177.8 mm or 32 calibers) twist barrel. NATO SS109 ball and L110 tracer bullets should only be used in emergency situations at ranges under with a one turn in 12 inches (1:304.8 mm or 54.8 calibers) twist, as this twist is insufficient to stabilize these projectiles.
Weapons designed to adequately stabilize both the M193 or SS109 projectiles (like civilian market clones) usually have a six-groove, right-hand twist, one turn in 9 inches (1:228.6 mm or 41.1 calibers) or one turn in 8 inches (1:203.2 mm or 36.5 calibers) bore, although other and 1:7 inches twist rates are available as well.

===Recoil===

The M16 uses a &quot;straight-line&quot; recoil design, where the recoil spring is located in the stock directly behind the action, and serves the dual function of operating spring and recoil buffer. The stock being in line with the bore also reduces muzzle rise, especially during automatic fire. Because recoil does not significantly shift the point of aim, faster follow-up shots are possible and user fatigue is reduced. In addition, current model M16 flash-suppressors also act as compensators to reduce recoil further.
Notes: Free recoil is calculated by using the rifle weight, bullet weight, muzzle velocity, and charge weight. It is that which would be measured if the rifle were fired suspended from strings, free to recoil. A rifle&#x27;s perceived recoil is also dependent on many other factors which are not readily quantified.

===Sights===


The M16&#x27;s most distinctive ergonomic feature is the carrying handle and rear sight assembly on top of the receiver. This is a by-product of the original AR-10 design, where the carrying handle contained a rear sight that could be set for specific range settings and also served to protect the charging handle.
The M16 carry handle also provided mounting groove interfaces and a hole at the bottom of the handle groove for mounting a Colt 3×20 telescopic sight featuring a Bullet Drop Compensation elevation adjustment knob for ranges from . This concurs with the pre-M16A2 maximum effective range of . The Colt 3×20 telescopic sight was factory adjusted to be parallax-free at . In Delft, the Netherlands Artillerie-Inrichtingen produced a roughly similar 3×25 telescopic sight for the carrying handle mounting interfaces.

The M16 elevated iron sight line has a sight radius. As the M16 series rear sight, front sight and sighting in targets designs were modified over time and non-iron sight (optical) aiming devices and new service ammunition were introduced zeroing procedures changed.

The standard pre-M16A2 &quot;Daylight Sight System&quot; uses an AR-15-style L-type flip, two aperture rear sight featuring two combat settings: short-range and long-range , marked &#x27;L&#x27;. The pre-M16A2 &quot;Daylight Sight System&quot; short-range and long-range zeros are with M193 ammunition. The rear sight features a windage drum that can be adjusted during zeroing with about 1 MOA increments. The front sight is a tapered round post of approximately diameter adjustable during zeroing in about 1 MOA increments. A cartridge or tool is required to (re)zero the sight line.

An alternative pre-M16A2 &quot;Low Light Level Sight System&quot;, includes a front sight post with a weak light source provided by tritium radioluminescence in an embedded small glass vial and a two aperture rear sight consisting of a diameter aperture marked &#x27;L&#x27; intended for normal use out to and a diameter large aperture for night firing. Regulation stipulates the radioluminescent front sight post must be replaced if more than 144 months (12 years) elapsed after manufacture. The &quot;Low Light Level Sight System&quot; elevation and windage adjustment increments are somewhat coarser compared to the &quot;Daylight Sight System&quot;.

With the advent of the M16A2, a less simple fully adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in with an elevation wheel for specific range settings between in 100 m increments and to allow windage adjustments with a windage knob without the need of a cartridge or tool. The unmarked approximately diameter aperture rear sight is for normal firing situations, zeroing and with the elevation knob for target distances up to 800 meters. The downsides of relatively small rear sight apertures are less light transmission through the aperture and a reduced field of view. A new larger approximately diameter aperture, marked &#x27;0-2&#x27; and featuring a windage setting index mark, offers a larger field of view during battle conditions and is used as a ghost ring for quick target engagement and during limited visibility. When flipped down, the engraved windage mark on top of the &#x27;0-2&#x27; aperture ring shows the dialed in windage setting on a windage scale at the rear of the rear sight assembly. When the normal use rear aperture sight is zeroed at 300 m with SS109/M855 ammunition, first used in the M16A2, the &#x27;0-2&#x27; rear sight will be zeroed for 200 m. The front sight post was widened to approximately diameter and became square and became adjustable during zeroing in about 1.2 MOA increments.

The M16A4 omitted the carrying handle and rear sight assembly on top of the receiver. Instead, it features a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny railed flat-top upper receiver for mounting various optical sighting devices or a new detachable carrying handle and M16A2-style rear sight assembly. The current U.S. Army and Air Force issue M4A1 carbine comes with the M68 close combat optic and back-up iron sight. The U.S. Marine Corps uses the ACOG Rifle Combat Optic and the U.S. Navy uses the EOTech holographic weapon sight.

===Range and accuracy===
The M16 rifle is considered to be very accurate for a service rifle. Its light recoil, high-velocity and flat trajectory allow shooters to take headshots out to 300 meters. Newer M16s use the newer M855 cartridge increasing their effective range to 600 meters. They are more accurate than their predecessors and are capable of shooting 1–3-inch groups at 100 yards. &quot;In Fallujah, Iraq Marines with ACOG-equipped M16A4s created a stir by taking so many headshots that until the wounds were closely examined, some observers thought the insurgents had been executed.&quot; The newest M855A1 EPR cartridge is even more accurate and during testing &quot;...has shown that, on average, 95 percent of the rounds will hit within an 8 × 8-inch (20.3 × 20.3 cm) target at 600 meters.&quot;


===Terminal ballistics===
The 5.56×45mm cartridge had several advantages over the 7.62×51mm NATO round used in the M14 rifle. It enabled each soldier to carry more ammunition and was easier to control during automatic or burst fire. The 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge can also produce massive wounding effects when the bullet impacts at high speed and yaws (&quot;tumbles&quot;) in tissue leading to fragmentation and rapid transfer of energy.


The original ammunition for the M16 was the 55-grain M193 cartridge. When fired from a barrel at ranges of up to , the thin-jacketed lead-cored round traveled fast enough (above ) that the force of striking a human body would cause the round to yaw (or tumble) and fragment into about a dozen pieces of various sizes thus created wounds that were out of proportion to its caliber. These wounds were so devastating that many considered the M16 to be an inhumane weapon. As the 5.56 mm round&#x27;s velocity decreases, so does the number of fragments that it produces. The 5.56 mm round does not normally fragment at distances beyond 200 meters or at velocities below 2500 ft/s, and its lethality becomes largely dependent on shot placement.

With the development of the M16A2, the new 62-grain M855 cartridge was adopted in 1983. The heavier bullet had more energy and was made with a steel core to penetrate Soviet body armor. However, this caused less fragmentation on impact and reduced effects against targets without armor, both of which lessened kinetic energy transfer and wounding ability. Some soldiers and Marines coped with this through training, with requirements to shoot vital areas three times to guarantee killing the target.

However, there have been repeated and consistent reports of the M855&#x27;s inability to wound effectively (i.e., fragment) when fired from the short barreled M4 carbine (even at close ranges). The M4&#x27;s 14.5-in. barrel length reduces muzzle velocity to about 2900 ft/s. This reduced wounding ability is one reason that, despite the Army&#x27;s transition to short-barrel M4s, the Marine Corps has decided to continue using the M16A4 with its 20-inch barrel as the 5.56×45mm M855 is largely dependent upon high velocity in order to wound effectively.

In 2003, the U.S. Army contended that the lack of lethality of the 5.56×45mm was more a matter of perception than fact. With good shot placement to the head and chest, the target was usually defeated without issue. The majority of failures were the result of hitting the target in non-vital areas such as extremities. However, a minority of failures occurred in spite of multiple hits to the chest. In 2006, a study found that 20% of soldiers using the M4 carbine wanted more lethality or stopping power. In June 2010, the U.S. Army announced it began shipping its new 5.56 mm, lead-free, M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round to active combat zones. This upgrade is designed to maximize performance of the 5.56×45mm round, to extend range, improve accuracy, increase penetration and to consistently fragment in soft-tissue when fired from not only standard length M16s, but also the short-barreled M4 carbines. The U.S. Army has been impressed with the new M855A1 EPR round. A 7.62 NATO M80A1 EPR variant was also developed.

===Magazines===

The M16&#x27;s magazine was meant to be a lightweight, disposable item. As such, it is made of pressed/stamped aluminum and was not designed to be durable. The M16 originally used a 20-round magazine which was later replaced by a bent 30-round design. As a result, the magazine follower tends to rock or tilt, causing malfunctions. Many non-U.S. and commercial magazines have been developed to effectively mitigate these shortcomings, e.g., H&amp;K&#x27;s all-stainless-steel magazine, Magpul&#x27;s polymer P-MAG, etc.

Production of the 30-round magazine started late 1967 but did not fully replace the 20-round magazine until the mid-1970s. Standard USGI aluminum 30-round M16 magazines weigh empty and are long. The newer plastic magazines are about a half-inch longer. The newer steel magazines are about 0.5-inch longer and four ounces heavier. The M16&#x27;s magazine has become the unofficial NATO STANAG magazine and is currently used by many Western nations, in numerous weapon systems.

In 2009, the U.S. military began fielding an &quot;improved magazine&quot; identified by a tan-colored follower. &quot;The new follower incorporates an extended rear leg and modified bullet protrusion for improved round stacking and orientation. The self-leveling/anti-tilt follower minimizes jamming while a wider spring coil profile creates even force distribution. The performance gains have not added weight or cost to the magazines.&quot;

In July 2016, the U.S. Army introduced another improvement, the new Enhanced Performance Magazine, which it says will result in a 300% increase in reliability in the M4 carbine. Developed by the United States Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center and the Army Research Laboratory in 2013, it is tan colored with blue follower to distinguish it from earlier, incompatible magazines.

===Muzzle devices===
Most M16 rifles have a barrel threaded in 1⁄2-28&quot; threads to incorporate the use of a muzzle device such as a flash suppressor or sound suppressor. The initial flash suppressor design had three tines or prongs and was designed to preserve the shooter&#x27;s night vision by disrupting the flash. Unfortunately it was prone to breakage and getting entangled in vegetation. The design was later changed to close the end to avoid this and became known as the &quot;A1&quot; or &quot;bird cage&quot; flash suppressor on the M16A1. Eventually on the M16A2 version of the rifle, the bottom port was closed to reduce muzzle climb and prevent dust from rising when the rifle was fired in the prone position. For these reasons, the U.S. military declared the A2 flash suppressor as a compensator or a muzzle brake; but it is more commonly known as the &quot;GI&quot; or &quot;A2&quot; flash suppressor.

The M16&#x27;s Vortex Flash Hider weighs 3 ounces, is 2.25 inches long, and does not require a lock washer to attach to the barrel. It was developed in 1984 and is one of the earliest privately designed muzzle devices. The U.S. military uses the Vortex Flash Hider on M4 carbines and M16 rifles. A version of the Vortex has been adopted by the Canadian Military for the Colt Canada C8 CQB rifle. Other flash suppressors developed for the M16 include the Phantom Flash Suppressor by Yankee Hill Machine (YHM) and the KX-3 by Noveske Rifleworks.

The threaded barrel allows sound suppressors with the same thread pattern to be installed directly to the barrel; however this can result in complications such as being unable to remove the suppressor from the barrel due to repeated firing on full auto or three-round burst. A number of suppressor manufacturers have designed &quot;direct-connect&quot; sound suppressors which can be installed over an existing M16&#x27;s flash suppressor as opposed to using the barrel&#x27;s threads.

===Grenade launchers and shotguns===
All current M16-type rifles can mount under-barrel 40 mm grenade launchers, such as the M203 and M320. Both use the same 40×46mm LV grenades as the older, stand-alone M79 grenade launcher. The M16 can also mount under-barrel 12 gauge shotguns such as KAC Masterkey or the M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System.

===M234 launcher===

The M234 riot control launcher is an M16-series rifle attachment firing an M755 blank round. The M234 mounts on the muzzle, bayonet lug, and front sight post of the M16. It fires either the M734 64 mm kinetic riot control or the M742 64 mm CSI riot control ring airfoil projectiles. The latter produces a 4 to 5-foot tear gas cloud on impact. The main advantage to using ring airfoil projectiles is that their design does not allow them to be thrown back by rioters with any real effect. The M234 is no longer used by U.S. forces. It has been replaced by the M203 grenade launcher and nonlethal ammunition.

===Bayonet===
The M16 is long with an M7 bayonet attached. The M7 bayonet is based on earlier designs such as the M4, M5, &amp; M6 bayonets, all of which are direct descendants of the M3 fighting knife and have spear-point blade with a half sharpened secondary edge. The newer M9 bayonet has a clip-point blade with saw teeth along the spine and can be used as a multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. The current USMC OKC-3S bayonet bears a resemblance to the Marines&#x27; iconic Ka-Bar fighting knife with serrations near the handle.

===Bipod===
For use as an ad-hoc automatic rifle, the M16 and M16A1 could be equipped with the XM3 bipod, later standardized as the &quot;Bipod, M3&quot; (1966) and &quot;Rifle Bipod M3&quot; (1983). Weighing only 0.6 lb, the simple and non-adjustable bipod clamps to the barrel of the rifle to allow for supported fire.

==NATO standards==
In March 1970, the U.S. recommended that all NATO forces adopt the 5.56×45mm cartridge. This shift represented a change in the philosophy of the military&#x27;s long-held position about caliber size. By the mid 1970s, other armies were looking at M16-style weapons. A NATO standardization effort soon started and tests of various rounds were carried out starting in 1977. The U.S. offered the 5.56×45mm M193 round, but there were concerns about its penetration in the face of the wider introduction of body armor. In the end, the Belgian 5.56×45mm SS109 round was chosen (STANAG 4172) in October 1980. The SS109 round was based on the U.S. cartridge but included a new stronger, heavier, 62-grain bullet design, with better long-range performance and improved penetration (specifically, to consistently penetrate the side of a steel helmet at 600 meters). Due to its design and lower muzzle velocity (about 3110 ft/s) the Belgian SS109 round is considered more humane because it is less likely to fragment than the U.S. M193 round. The NATO 5.56×45mm standard ammunition produced for U.S. forces is designated M855.

In October 1980, shortly after NATO accepted the 5.56×45mm NATO rifle cartridge. Draft Standardization Agreement 4179 (STANAG 4179) was proposed to allow NATO members to easily share rifle ammunition and magazines down to the individual soldier level. The magazine chosen to become the &quot;STANAG magazine&quot; was originally designed for the U.S. M16 rifle. Many NATO member nations, but not all, subsequently developed or purchased rifles with the ability to accept this type of magazine. However, the standard was never ratified and remains a &#x27;Draft STANAG&#x27;.

All current M16 type rifles are designed to fire STANAG 22 mm rifle grenades from their integral flash hiders without the use of an adapter. These 22 mm grenade types range from anti-tank rounds to simple finned tubes with a fragmentation hand grenade attached to the end. They come in the &quot;standard&quot; type which are propelled by a blank cartridge inserted into the chamber of the rifle. They also come in the &quot;bullet trap&quot; and &quot;shoot through&quot; types, as their names imply, they use live ammunition. The U.S. military does not generally use rifle grenades; however, they are used by other nations.

The NATO Accessory Rail STANAG 4694, or Picatinny rail STANAG 2324, or a &quot;Tactical Rail&quot; is a bracket used on M16 type rifles to provide a standardized mounting platform. The rail comprises a series of ridges with a T-shaped cross-section interspersed with flat &quot;spacing slots&quot;. Scopes are mounted either by sliding them on from one end or the other; by means of a &quot;rail-grabber&quot; which is clamped to the rail with bolts, thumbscrews or levers; or onto the slots between the raised sections. The rail was originally for scopes. However, once established, the use of the system was expanded to other accessories, such as tactical lights, laser aiming modules, night vision devices, reflex sights, foregrips, bipods, and bayonets.

Currently, the M16 is in use by 15 NATO countries and more than 80 countries worldwide.

==Variants==
===M16===
This was the first M16 variant adopted operationally, originally by the U.S. Air Force. It was equipped with triangular handguards, buttstocks without a compartment for the storage of a cleaning kit, a three-pronged &quot;duckbill&quot; flash suppressor designed to preserve the shooter&#x27;s night vision by disrupting the flash, full auto, and no forward assist. The M16 has a safe/semi/auto selective fire trigger group. Bolt carriers were originally chrome plated and slick-sided, lacking forward assist notches. Later, the chrome-plated carriers were dropped in favor of Army-issued notched and parkerized carriers, though the interior portion of the bolt carrier is still chrome-lined. The barrel rifling had a 1:12 (305 mm) twist rate to adequately stabilize the M193 ball and M196 tracer ammunition. The Air Force continued to operate these weapons until around 2001, at which time the Air Force converted all of its M16s to the M16A2 configuration.

The M16 was also adopted by the British SAS, who used it during the Falklands War.

===XM16E1 and M16A1 (Colt Model 603)===


The U.S. Army XM16E1 was essentially the same weapon as the M16 with the addition of a forward assist and corresponding notches in the chrome bolt carrier. A rib was built into the side of the receiver to help prevent accidentally pressing the magazine release button while closing the ejection port cover.

The M16A1 was the finalized production model and was produced from February 1967 until 1982. To address issues with the XM16E1, for the M16A1 a closed, birdcage symmetric flash suppressor with open side slots to the top, bottom, left and right replaced the XM16E1&#x27;s three-pronged flash suppressor, which caught on twigs and leaves, from 1967 onwards. Various other changes were made after numerous problems in the field. Cleaning kits were developed and issued, while barrels with chrome-plated chambers and later fully lined bores were introduced. A small storage compartment inside the stock was introduced. The buttstock storage compartment is often used for storing a basic cleaning kit. To promote reliability and durability, the mechanical behavior of the operating system was revised to make it compatible for using US military issued ammunition loaded with WC846 ball powder (which reaches peak pressure significantly quicker than the extruded IMR8208M powder and increases the cyclic rate of fire for which the operating system was originally designed). Revisions like reducing the diameter of the gas port to mitigate the higher port pressure caused by the ball powder to properly gas the operating system again, updating the buffer assembly, changing the bolt carrier surface finish to manganese phosphate and the gas tube material to stainless steel contributed to improved mechanical behavior.

The rib was extended on production M16A1s to help in preventing the magazine release from inadvertently being pressed. The hole in the bolt that accepts the cam pin was crimped inward on one side, in such a way that the cam pin may not be inserted with the bolt installed backwards, which would cause failures to eject until corrected. With these and other changes, the malfunction rate slowly declined, and new soldiers were generally unfamiliar with early problems.

The M16A1 saw limited use in training capacities until the early 2000s, but is no longer in active service with the U.S., although is still standard issue in many world armies.

===M16A2===

The development of the M16A2 rifle was originally requested by the United States Marine Corps in 1979 as a result of combat experience in Vietnam with the M16A1. It was officially adopted by the Department of Defense as the &quot;Rifle, 5.56 mm, M16A2&quot; in 1983. The Marines were the first branch of the U.S. Armed Forces to adopt it, in the early/mid-1980s, with the United States Army following suit in 1986.

Modifications to the M16A2 were extensive. In addition to the then new STANAG 4172 5.56×45mm NATO chambering and its accompanying rifling, the barrel was made with a greater thickness in front of the front sight post, to resist bending in the field and increase rigidity under sustained fire. The rest of the barrel was maintained at the original thickness to enable the M203 grenade launcher to be attached. The barrel rifling was revised to a faster 1:7 (178 mm) twist rate to adequately stabilize the new 5.56×45mm NATO SS109/M855 ball and L110/M856 tracer ammunition. The heavier longer SS109/M855 bullet reduced muzzle velocity from , to about 

A new adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters to take full advantage of the ballistic characteristics of the SS109/M855 rounds and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge The flash suppressor was again modified, this time to be closed on the bottom, so the new birdcage-type muzzle device would not kick up dirt or snow when being fired from the prone position, and additionally act as an asymmetric recoil compensator to reduce muzzle climb.

A spent case deflector was incorporated into the upper receiver immediately behind the ejection port to prevent (hot) cartridge cases from striking left-handed users. The action was also modified, replacing the fully automatic setting with a three-round burst setting. When using a fully automatic weapon, inexperienced troops often hold down the trigger and &quot;spray&quot; when under fire. The U.S. Army concluded that three-shot groups provide an optimum combination of ammunition conservation, accuracy, and firepower. The number of rounds fired in a burst is determined by a cam mechanism that trips the trigger mechanism for each shot in the burst. For the burst the trigger must be held down for the full duration of the burst. The M16 series will terminate the burst if the trigger is released before the burst is complete but keep the cam in position. Thus, the next time the trigger is pulled, the weapon will only fire one or two rounds. The USMC has retired the M16A2 in favor of the newer M16A4; a few M16A2s remain in service with the U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard.

The handguard was modified from the original triangular shape to a round one, which better fit smaller hands and could be fitted to older models of the M16. The new handguards were also symmetrical, so armories need not separate left- and right-hand spares. The handguard retention ring was tapered to make it easier to install and uninstall the handguards.

The new buttstock became ten times stronger than the original due to advances in polymer technology since the early 1960s. Original M16 stocks were made from cellulose-impregnated phenolic resin; the newer M16A2 stocks were engineered from DuPont Zytel glass-filled thermoset polymers and became a replacement part for the preceding M16A1. The new buttstock was lengthened by and included a fully textured polymer buttplate for better grip on the shoulder and retained a panel for accessing a small compartment inside the stock, often used for storing a basic cleaning kit.

The A2 barrel profile has a greater thickness from the front sight post to the muzzle, after bending in this area was reported in the field. Tests by the M16A2 team showed that this increased the resistance to intentional bending in this area by a factor 9. As to not further increase weight beyond acceptable levels, and to maintain commonality with the M203 grenade launcher, the rear half under the handguard maintained its original thin profile. After the new technical data was submitted, the team discovered that they had made an error in assessing the problem - the replaced bent barrels were not actually bent. When inspecting some using a borescope, they discovered that a burr left from drilling/reaming the gas port was causing copper fouling to build up at the front sight block, interfering with the gauge used. Cleaning this fouling caused the &quot;bent&quot; barrels to re-pass inspection. However this discovery came too late in the process to revert the change in profile.

A notch for the middle finger was added to the pistol grip as well as more texture to enhance the grip. The new pistol grips were engineered from Zytel glass-filled thermoset polymers. The M16A2 pistol grip became a replacement part for the preceding M16A1. The standard Model 645 M16A2 has a safe/semi/three-round burst selective fire trigger group. It became standard issue for the U.S. Marine Corps and Army.

There is also a safe/semi/three-round burst/automatic selective fire trigger group Model 708 version of M16A2 rifle named &quot;M16A2 Enhanced&quot;, used by some militaries around the world.

===M16A3===
The M16A3 is a modified version of the M16A2 adopted in small numbers by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Seabees, US security units, and Philippine National Police. It features the M16A1 selective fire trigger group providing &quot;safe&quot;, &quot;semi-automatic&quot; and &quot;fully automatic&quot; modes. Otherwise, it is externally similar to the M16A2.

===M16A4===

Adopted in July 1997, the M16A4 is the fourth generation of the M16 series. It is equipped with a removable carrying handle and Picatinny rail for mounting optics and other ancillary devices. The M16A4 rear aperture sights are adjustable from up to , where the further similar M16A2 iron sights line can reach up to . The introduction of the Picatinny rail required the use of a higher F-marked front sight base to raise the post. The FN M16A4, using safe/semi/three-round burst selective fire, became standard issue for the U.S. Marine Corps.

Colt also produces M16A4 models for international purchases:
* R0901 / RO901/ NSN 1005-01-383-2872 (Safe/Semi/Auto)
* R0905 / RO905 (Safe/Semi/Burst)

A study of significant changes to Marine M16A4 rifles released in February 2015 outlined several new features that could be added from inexpensive and available components. Those features included: a muzzle compensator in place of the flash suppressor to manage recoil and allow for faster follow-on shots, though at the cost of noise and flash signature and potential overpressure in close quarters; a heavier and/or free-floating barrel to increase accuracy from 4.5 MOA (Minute(s) Of Angle) to potentially 2 MOA; changing the reticle on the Rifle Combat Optic from chevron-shaped to a semi-circular reticle with a dot at the center used in the M27 IAR&#x27;s Squad Day Optic so as not to obscure the target at long distance; using a trigger group with a more consistent pull force, even a reconsideration of the burst capability; and the addition of ambidextrous charging handles and bolt catch releases for easier use with left-handed shooters.

In 2014, Marine units were provided with a limited number of adjustable stocks in place of the traditional fixed stock for their M16A4s to issue to smaller Marines who would have trouble comfortably reaching the trigger when wearing body armor. The adjustable stocks were added as a standard authorized accessory, meaning units can use operations and maintenance funds to purchase more if needed.

The Marine Corps had long maintained the full-length M16 as their standard infantry rifle, but in October 2015 the switch to the M4 carbine was approved as the standard-issue weapon, giving Marine infantry a smaller and more compact weapon. Enough M4s were already in the inventory to re-equip all necessary units by September 2016, and M16A4s were moved to support and non-infantry Marines.

===Summary of differences===
==Derivatives==
===Colt Commando (XM177 &amp; GAU-5)===

In Vietnam, some soldiers were issued a carbine version of the M16 named XM177. The XM177 had a shorter barrel and a telescoping stock, which made it substantially more compact. It also possessed a combination flash hider/sound moderator to reduce problems with muzzle flash and loud report. The Air Force&#x27;s GAU-5/A (XM177) and the Army&#x27;s XM177E1 variants differed over the latter&#x27;s inclusion of a forward assist, although some GAU-5s do have the forward assist. The final Air Force GAU-5/A and Army XM177E2 had an barrel with a longer flash/sound suppressor. The lengthening of the barrel was to support the attachment of Colt&#x27;s own XM148 40 mm grenade launcher. These versions were also known as the Colt Commando model commonly referenced and marketed as the CAR-15. The variants were issued in limited numbers to special forces, helicopter crews, Air Force pilots, Air Force Security Police Military Working Dog (MWD) handlers, officers, radio operators, artillerymen, and troops other than front line riflemen. Some USAF GAU-5A/As were later equipped with even longer 1/12 rifled barrels as the two shorter versions were worn out. The barrel allowed the use of MILES gear and for bayonets to be used with the sub-machine guns (as the Air Force described them). By 1989, the Air Force started to replace the earlier barrels with 1/7 rifled models for use with the M855-round. The weapons were given the redesignation of GUU-5/P.

These were used by the British Special Air Service during the Falklands War.

===M4 carbine===

The M4 carbine was developed from various outgrowths of these designs, including a number of -barreled A1 style carbines. The XM4 (Colt Model 720) started its trials in 1984, with a barrel of . The weapon became the M4 in 1991. Officially adopted as a replacement for the M3 &quot;Grease Gun&quot; (and the Beretta M9 and M16A2 for select troops) in 1994, it was used with great success in the Balkans and in more recent conflicts, including the Afghanistan and Iraq theaters. The M4 carbine has a three-round burst firing mode, while the M4A1 carbine has a fully automatic firing mode. Both have a Picatinny rail on the upper receiver, allowing the carry handle/rear sight assembly to be replaced with other sighting devices.

====M4 Commando====

Colt also returned to the original &quot;Commando&quot; idea, with its Model 733, essentially a modernized XM177E2 with many of the features introduced on the M16A2.

===M5 carbine===

The M5 carbine system was developed by Colt as an improvement on the M4 carbine. It incorporates a fully ambidextrous lower receiver, free-floating barrel and lengthened upper rail. The M5 carbine has four possible barrel lengths: 10.3, 11.5, 14.5 and 16.1 inches. Other M5 variants and calibers are the: M5 SCW (Sub-compact weapon) (5.56×45mm); M5 300 (.300 AAC Blackout); M5 SMG (9×19mm); CMK (7.62×39mm); M7 Battle Rifle (7.62×51mm) and Designated Marksman and Semi-Automatic Sniper System (both 5.56×45mm).

===Diemaco C7 and C8===

The Diemaco C7 and C8 are a family of rifles developed concurrently with the M16A2. They are the standard issued rifle for the Canadian Armed Forces, manufactured by Diemaco (currently Colt Canada). The C7 is a branch developed from the experimental M16A1E1. Like earlier M16s, it can be fired in either semi-automatic or automatic mode, instead of the burst function selected for the M16A2. The C7 also features the structural strengthening, improved handguards, and longer stock developed for the M16A2. Diemaco changed the trapdoor in the buttstock to make it easier to access and a spacer of is available to adjust stock length to user preference, along with the addition of hammer-forged barrels. Unlike the American M16A2s, the Diemaco C7s utilize A1 style rear sights. The Canadians originally desired to use a heavy barrel profile instead.

The C7 has been developed to the C7A1, with a Weaver rail on the upper receiver for a C79 3.4×28 optical sight, and to the C7A2, with different furniture and internal improvements. The Diemaco produced Weaver rail on the original C7A1 variants does not meet the M1913 &quot;Picatinny&quot; standard, leading to some problems with mounting commercial sights. This is easily remedied with minor modification to the upper receiver or the sight itself. Since Diemaco&#x27;s acquisition by Colt to form Colt Canada, all Canadian produced flattop upper receivers are machined to the M1913 standard.

The C8 is the carbine version of the C7. The C7 and C8 are also used by &quot;Hærens Jegerkommando&quot;, &quot;Marinejegerkommandoen&quot; and FSK (Norway), Denmark&#x27;s Armed Forces (all branches), and the Netherlands Armed Forces as its main infantry weapon. Following trials, variants became the weapon of choice of the British SAS.

===Mk 4 Mod 0===
The Mk 4 Mod 0 was a variant of the M16A1 produced for the U.S. Navy SEALs during the Vietnam War and adopted in April 1970. It differed from the basic M16A1 primarily in being optimized for maritime operations and coming equipped with a sound suppressor. Most of the operating parts of the rifle were coated in Kal-Guard, a hole of was drilled through the stock and buffer tube for drainage, and an O-ring was added to the end of the buffer assembly. The weapon could reportedly be carried to the depth of in water without damage. The initial Mk 2 Mod 0 Blast Suppressor was based on the U.S. Army&#x27;s Human Engineering Lab&#x27;s (HEL) M4 noise suppressor. The HEL M4 vented gas directly from the action, requiring a modified bolt carrier. A gas deflector was added to the charging handle to prevent gas from contacting the user. Thus, the HEL M4 suppressor was permanently mounted though it allowed normal semi-automatic and automatic operation. If the HEL M4 suppressor were removed, the weapon would have to be manually loaded after each single shot. On the other hand, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was considered an integral part of the Mk 4 Mod 0 rifle, but it would function normally if the suppressor were removed. The Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor also drained water much more quickly and did not require any modification to the bolt carrier or to the charging handle. In the late 1970s, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was replaced by the Mk 2 blast suppressor made by Knight&#x27;s Armament Company (KAC). The KAC suppressor can be fully submerged and water will drain out in less than eight seconds. It will operate without degradation even if the rifle is fired at the maximum rate of fire. The U.S. Army replaced the HEL M4 with the much simpler Studies in Operational Negation of Insurgency and Counter-Subversion (SIONICS) MAW-A1 noise and flash suppressor.

===US Navy Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle===

Developed to increase the effective range of soldiers in the designated marksman role, the U.S. Navy developed the Mark 12 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR). Configurations in service vary, but the core of the Mark 12 SPR is an 18&quot; heavy barrel with muzzle brake and free float tube. This tube relieves pressure on the barrel caused by standard handguards and greatly increases the potential accuracy of the system. Also common are higher magnification optics ranging from the 6× power Trijicon ACOG to the Leupold Mark 4 Tactical rifle scopes. Firing Mark 262 Mod 0 ammunition with a 77gr Open tip Match bullet, the system has an official effective range of 600+ meters. However, published reports of confirmed kills beyond 800 m from Iraq and Afghanistan were not uncommon.

===M231 Firing Port Weapon (FPW)===
The M231 Firing Port Weapon (FPW) is an adapted version of the M16 assault rifle for firing from ports on the M2 Bradley. The infantry&#x27;s normal M16s are too long for use in a &quot;buttoned up&quot; fighting vehicle, so the FPW was developed to provide a suitable weapon for this role.

===Colt Model 655 and 656 &quot;Sniper&quot; variants===
With the expanding Vietnam War, Colt developed two rifles of the M16 pattern for evaluation as possible light sniper or designated marksman rifles. The Colt Model 655 M16A1 Special High Profile was essentially a standard A1 rifle with a heavier barrel and a scope bracket that attached to the rifle&#x27;s carry handle. The Colt Model 656 M16A1 Special Low Profile had a special upper receiver with no carrying handle. Instead, it had a low-profile iron sight adjustable for windage and a Weaver base for mounting a scope, a precursor to the Colt and Picatinny rails. It also had a hooded front iron sight in addition to the heavy barrel. Both rifles came standard with either a Leatherwood/Realist scope 3–9× Adjustable Ranging Telescope. Some of them were fitted with a Sionics noise and flash suppressor. Neither of these rifles were ever standardized.

These weapons can be seen in many ways to be predecessors of the U.S. Army&#x27;s SDM-R and the USMC&#x27;s SAM-R weapons.

===Mekut&#x27;zrar===
Israel was supplied with large numbers of M16A1 rifles by the US Government, many of which were shortened to make them more suitable for urban combat, storage in vehicles, and policing use by shortening them. The 20-inch M16A1 barrel was pruned back to just behind the gas port, while a new gas port was drilled to accommodate a carbine-length gas system as the front sight base was pinned in place. The barrel was also threaded for a standard M16A1 birdcage flash suppressor and the resulting barrel was just shy of 13-inch overall, and a CAR-15 type collapsible buttstock was fitted to replaced the fixed M16A1 fixed buttstock, thus they approximate the size of CAR-15 type carbines. The informal term &quot;Mekut&#x27;zrar&quot; translates to &quot;sawed-off&quot; or &quot;shorty&quot;.

==Production and users==
The M16 is the most commonly manufactured 5.56×45mm rifle in the world. Currently, the M16 is in use by 15 NATO countries and more than 80 countries worldwide. Together, numerous companies in the United States, Canada, and China have produced more than 8,000,000 rifles of all variants. Approximately 90% are still in operation. The M16 replaced both the M14 rifle and M2 carbine as standard infantry rifle of the U.S. armed forces. Although, the M14 continues to see limited service, mostly in sniper, designated marksman, and ceremonial roles.

<text>Marlon Brando Jr. (April 3, 1924 – July 1, 2004) was an American actor. Widely regarded as one of the greatest cinema actors of the 20th century, Brando received numerous accolades throughout his career, which spanned six decades, including two Academy Awards, three British Academy Film Awards, a Cannes Film Festival Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award. Brando is credited with being one of the first actors to bring the Stanislavski system of acting and method acting to mainstream audiences.

Brando came under the influence of Stella Adler and Stanislavski&#x27;s system in the 1940s. He began his career on stage, where he was lauded for adeptly interpreting his characters. He made his Broadway debut in the play &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1944) and won Theater World Awards for his roles in the plays &quot;Candida&quot; and &quot;Truckline Cafe&quot;, both in 1946. He returned to Broadway as Stanley Kowalski in the Tennessee Williams play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1947), a role he reprised in the 1951 film adaptation, directed by Elia Kazan.

He made his film debut playing a wounded G.I. in &quot;The Men&quot; (1950) and won two Academy Awards for Best Actor for his roles as a dockworker in the crime drama film &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954) and Vito Corleone in the gangster epic &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972). He was Oscar-nominated for playing Stanley Kowalski in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1951), Emiliano Zapata in &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; (1952), Mark Antony in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953), an air force pilot in &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1957), an American expatriate in &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; (1973), and a lawyer in &quot;A Dry White Season&quot; (1989).

Brando was known for playing characters who later became popular icons, such as the rebellious motorcycle-gang leader Johnny Strabler in &quot;The Wild One&quot; (1953), and he came to be seen as an emblem of the era&#x27;s so-called &quot;generation gap&quot;. He also played Sky Masterson in the musical film &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955), Fletcher Christian in the action film &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962), Jor-El in the superhero film &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), and as Colonel Kurtz in the Vietnam War drama &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979). He made his directorial film debut in the western drama &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; (1961), in which he also starred, which did poorly at the box office.

On television, Brando won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his role in the ABC miniseries &quot;&quot; (1979), after which he took a nine-year hiatus from acting. He later returned to film, with varying degrees of commercial and critical success. The last two decades of his life were marked by controversy, and his troubled private life received significant public attention. He struggled with mood disorders and legal issues. His last films include &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Score&quot; (2001).

==Early life and education==

Marlon Brando Jr. was born on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, as the only son of Marlon Brando Sr. and Dorothy Pennebaker. His father was a salesman who often travelled out-of-state and his mother was a stage actress, often away from home. His mother&#x27;s absence resulted in Brando becoming attached to the family&#x27;s housekeeper, who eventually left to get married, causing Brando to develop abandonment issues. His two elder sisters were Jocelyn and Frances.

Despite the spelling of his last name having Italian origin, and what some of his most notable film roles would suggest, Brando did not have Italian ancestry. Brando&#x27;s ancestry was mostly German, Dutch, English, and Irish. His patrilineal immigrant ancestor, Johann Wilhelm Brandau, arrived in New York City in the early 1700s from the Palatinate in Germany. He is also a descendant of Louis DuBois, a French Huguenot, who arrived in New York around 1660. His maternal great-grandfather, Myles Joseph Gahan, was an Irish immigrant who served as a medic in the American Civil War. In 1995, he gave an interview in Ireland in which he said, &quot;I have never been so happy in my life. When I got off the plane I had this rush of emotion. I have never felt at home in a place as I do here. I am seriously contemplating Irish citizenship.&quot;
In 1930, when Brando was only six years old, the family moved to Evanston, Illinois, where Brando mimicked other people, developed a reputation for pranking, and met Wally Cox, with whom he remained friends until Cox&#x27;s death in 1973. In 1936, his parents separated and he and his siblings moved with their mother to Santa Ana, California. Two years later, his parents reconciled, and his father purchased a farmhouse in Libertyville, Illinois. Brando attended Libertyville High School, excelling at sports and drama, but failing in every other subject. Consequently, he was held back for a year, and with his history of misbehaving, he was expelled in 1941.

Brando was sent by his father to Shattuck Military Academy, where his father had also studied. There, Brando continued to excel at acting until 1943, when he was put on probation for being insubordinate to an officer during maneuvers. He was confined to the campus, but sneaked into town and was caught. The faculty voted to expel him, although he was supported by the students who thought expulsion was too harsh. Brando was invited back for the following year, but decided instead to drop out of high school. He then worked as a ditch-digger at a summer job arranged by his father and tried to enlist in the Army, but his routine physical revealed that a football injury he had sustained at Shattuck had left him with a trick knee; he was classified physically unfit for military service.

Brando decided to follow his sisters to New York, studying at the American Theatre Wing Professional School, part of the Dramatic Workshop of the New School, with influential German director Erwin Piscator. In a 1988 documentary, &quot;Marlon Brando: The Wild One&quot;, Brando&#x27;s sister Jocelyn remembered, &quot;He was in a school play and enjoyed it ... So he decided he would go to New York and study acting because that was the only thing he had enjoyed. That was when he was 18.&quot; In the A&amp;E &quot;Biography&quot; episode on Brando, George Englund said Brando fell into acting in New York because &quot;he was accepted there. He wasn&#x27;t criticized. It was the first time in his life that he heard good things about himself.&quot; He spent his first few months in New York sleeping on friends&#x27; couches. For a time he lived with Roy Somlyo, who later became a four-time Emmy-winning Broadway producer.

Brando was an avid student and proponent of Stella Adler, from whom he learned the techniques of the Stanislavski system. This technique encouraged the actor to explore both internal and external aspects to fully realize the character being portrayed. Brando&#x27;s remarkable insight and sense of realism were evident early on. Adler used to recount that, when teaching Brando, she had instructed the class to act like chickens, and added that a nuclear bomb was about to fall on them. Most of the class clucked and ran around wildly, but Brando sat calmly and pretended to lay an egg. Asked by Adler why he had chosen to react this way, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m a chicken—what do I know about bombs?&quot; Despite being commonly regarded as a method actor, Brando disagreed. He claimed to have abhorred Lee Strasberg&#x27;s teachings:

Brando was the first to bring a natural approach to acting on film. According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to cameramen and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as naturally as that conversation, he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, &quot;Listen To Me Marlon&quot;, he said that prior to that, actors were like breakfast cereals, meaning they were predictable. Critics would later say that this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite him said it was just all part of his technique.

==Career==
=== 1944–1950: Early career ===
Brando used his Stanislavski System skills for his first summer stock roles in Sayville, New York, on Long Island. Brando established a pattern of erratic, insubordinate behavior in the few shows he had been in. His behavior had him kicked out of the cast of the New School&#x27;s production in Sayville, but he was soon afterwards discovered in a locally produced play there. Then, in 1944, he made it to Broadway in the bittersweet drama &quot;I Remember Mama&quot;, playing the son of Mady Christians. The Lunts wanted Brando to play the role of Alfred Lunt&#x27;s son in &quot;O Mistress Mine&quot;, and Lunt even coached him for the audition, but Brando made no attempt to even read his lines at the audition and was not hired. New York Drama Critics voted him &quot;Most Promising Young Actor&quot; for his role as an anguished veteran in &quot;Truckline Café&quot;, although the play was a commercial failure. In 1946, he appeared on Broadway as the young hero in the political drama &quot;A Flag is Born&quot;, refusing to accept wages above the Actors&#x27; Equity rate. In that same year, Brando played the role of Marchbanks alongside Katharine Cornell in her production&#x27;s revival of &quot;Candida&quot;, one of her signature roles. Cornell also cast him as the Messenger in her production of Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot; that same year. He was also offered the opportunity to portray one of the principal characters in the Broadway premiere of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;, but turned the part down after falling asleep while trying to read the massive script and pronouncing the play &quot;ineptly written and poorly constructed&quot;.

In 1945, Brando&#x27;s agent recommended he take a co-starring role in &quot;The Eagle Has Two Heads&quot; with Tallulah Bankhead, produced by Jack Wilson. Bankhead had turned down the role of Blanche Dubois in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946–1947 season. Bankhead recognized Brando&#x27;s potential, despite her disdain (which most Broadway veterans shared) for method acting, and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly. The two clashed greatly during the pre-Broadway tour, with Bankhead reminding Brando of his mother, being her age and also having a drinking problem. Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando&#x27;s behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening. &quot;I don&#x27;t care what your grandmother did,&quot; Wilson exclaimed, &quot;and that Method stuff, I want to know what you&#x27;re going to do!&quot; Brando in turn raised his voice, and acted with great power and passion. &quot;It was marvelous,&quot; a cast member recalled. &quot;Everybody hugged him and kissed him. He came ambling offstage and said to me, &#x27;They don&#x27;t think you can act unless you can yell.&#x27;&quot;

Critics were not as kind, however. A review of Brando&#x27;s performance in the opening assessed that Brando was &quot;still building his character, but at present fails to impress.&quot; One Boston critic remarked of Brando&#x27;s prolonged death scene, &quot;Brando looked like a car in midtown Manhattan searching for a parking space.&quot; He received better reviews at subsequent tour stops, but what his colleagues recalled was only occasional indications of the talent he would later demonstrate. &quot;There were a few times when he was really magnificent,&quot; Bankhead admitted to an interviewer in 1962. &quot;He was a great young actor when he wanted to be, but most of the time I couldn&#x27;t even hear him on the stage.&quot;
Brando displayed his apathy for the production by demonstrating some shocking onstage manners. He &quot;tried everything in the world to ruin it for her,&quot; Bankhead&#x27;s stage manager claimed. &quot;He nearly drove her crazy: scratching his crotch, picking his nose, doing anything.&quot; After several weeks on the road, they reached Boston, by which time Bankhead was ready to dismiss him. This proved to be one of the greatest blessings of his career, as it freed him up to play the role of Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams&#x27; 1947 play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, directed by Elia Kazan. Moreover, to that end, Bankhead herself, in her letter declining Williams&#x27; invitation to play the role of Blanche, gave Brando this ringing—albeit acid-tongued—endorsement stating &quot;I do have one suggestion for casting. I know of an actor who can appear as this brutish Stanley Kowalski character. I mean, a total pig of a man without sensitivity or grace of any kind. Marlon Brando would be perfect as Stanley. I have just fired the cad from my play, The Eagle Has Two Heads, and I know for a fact that he is looking for work&quot;.

Pierpont writes that John Garfield was first choice for the role, but &quot;made impossible demands.&quot; It was Kazan&#x27;s decision to fall back on the far less experienced (and technically too young for the role) Brando. In a letter dated August 29, 1947, Williams confided to his agent Audrey Wood: &quot;It had not occurred to me before what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in this part. It humanizes the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality and callousness of youth rather than a vicious old man ... A new value came out of Brando&#x27;s reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard.&quot; Brando based his portrayal of Kowalski on the boxer Rocky Graziano, whom he had studied at a local gymnasium. Graziano did not know who Brando was, but attended the production with tickets provided by the young man. He said, &quot;The curtain went up and on the stage is that son of a bitch from the gym, and he&#x27;s playing me.&quot;
In 1947, Brando performed a screen test for an early Warner Brothers script for the novel &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1944), which bore no relation to the film eventually produced in 1955. The screen test is included as an extra in the 2006 DVD release of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. Brando&#x27;s first screen role was a bitter paraplegic veteran in &quot;The Men&quot; (1950). He spent a month in bed at the Birmingham Army Hospital in Van Nuys to prepare for the role. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Bosley Crowther wrote that Brando as Ken &quot;is so vividly real, dynamic and sensitive that his illusion is complete&quot; and noted, &quot;Out of stiff and frozen silences he can lash into a passionate rage with the tearful and flailing frenzy of a taut cable suddenly cut.&quot;

By Brando&#x27;s own account, it may have been because of this film that his draft status was changed from 4-F to 1-A. He had had surgery on his trick knee, and it was no longer physically debilitating enough to incur exclusion from the draft. When Brando reported to the induction center, he answered a questionnaire by saying his race was &quot;human&quot;, his color was &quot;Seasonal-oyster white to beige&quot;, and he told an Army doctor that he was psychoneurotic. When the draft board referred him to a psychiatrist, Brando explained that he had been expelled from military school and had severe problems with authority. Coincidentally, the psychiatrist knew a doctor friend of Brando. Brando avoided military service during the Korean War.

Early in his career, Brando began using cue cards instead of memorizing his lines. Despite the objections of several of the film directors he worked with, Brando felt that this helped bring realism and spontaneity to his performances. He felt otherwise he would appear to be reciting a writer&#x27;s speech. In the TV documentary &quot;The Making of Superman: The Movie&quot;, Brando explained: &quot;If you don&#x27;t know what the words are but you have a general idea of what they are, then you look at the cue card and it gives you the feeling to the viewer, hopefully, that the person is really searching for what he is going to say—that he doesn&#x27;t know what to say&quot;. Some, however, thought Brando used the cards out of laziness or an inability to memorize his lines. Once, on the set of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, Brando was asked why he wanted his lines printed out. He responded: &quot;Because I can read them that way.&quot;

=== 1951–1954: Stardom and &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; ===
Brando brought his performance as Stanley Kowalski to the screen in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1951). It earned him his first Academy Award nomination in the Best Actor category. The role is regarded as one of Brando&#x27;s greatest.
He was also nominated the next year for &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; (1952), a fictionalized account of the life of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. The film recounted Zapata&#x27;s lower-class upbringing, his rise to power in the early 20th century, and death. The film was directed by Elia Kazan and co-starred Anthony Quinn. In the biopic &quot;Marlon Brando: The Wild One&quot;, Sam Shaw says: &quot;Secretly, before the picture started, he went to Mexico to the very town where Zapata lived and was born in and it was there that he studied the speech patterns of people, their behavior, movement.&quot; Most critics focused on the actor rather than the film, with &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; publishing rave reviews.

Years later, in his autobiography, Brando remarked: &quot;Tony Quinn, whom I admired professionally and liked personally, played my brother, but he was extremely cold to me while we shot that picture. During our scenes together, I sensed a bitterness toward me, and if I suggested a drink after work, he either turned me down or else was sullen and said little. Only years later did I learn why.&quot; Brando explained that, to create on-screen tension between the two, &quot;Gadg&quot; (Kazan) had told Quinn – who had taken over the role of Stanley Kowalski from Brando on Broadway – that Brando had been unimpressed with his work. After achieving the desired effect, Kazan never told Quinn that he had misled him. It was only many years later, after comparing notes, that Brando and Quinn realized the deception.

Brando&#x27;s next film, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953), received highly favorable reviews. Brando portrayed Mark Antony. While most acknowledged Brando&#x27;s talent, some critics felt Brando&#x27;s &quot;mumbling&quot; and other idiosyncrasies betrayed a lack of acting fundamentals and, when his casting was announced, many remained dubious about his prospects for success. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and co-starring British stage actor John Gielgud, Brando delivered an impressive performance, especially during Antony&#x27;s noted &quot;Friends, Romans, countrymen ...&quot; speech. Gielgud was so impressed that he offered Brando a full season at the Hammersmith Theatre, an offer he declined. In his biography on the actor, Stefan Kanfer writes, &quot;Marlon&#x27;s autobiography devotes one line to his work on that film: Among all those British professionals, &#x27;for me to walk onto a movie set and play Mark Anthony was asinine&#x27;—yet another example of his persistent self-denigration, and wholly incorrect.&quot;

Kanfer adds that after a screening of the film, director John Huston commented: &quot;Christ! It was like a furnace door opening—the heat came off the screen. I don&#x27;t know another actor who could do that.&quot; During the filming of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, Brando learned that Elia Kazan had cooperated with congressional investigators, naming a whole string of &quot;subversives&quot; to the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). By all accounts, Brando was upset by his mentor&#x27;s decision, but he worked with him again in &quot;On The Waterfront&quot;. &quot;None of us is perfect,&quot; he later wrote in his memoir, &quot;and I think that Gadg has done injury to others, but mostly to himself.&quot;

In 1953, Brando also starred in &quot;The Wild One&quot;, riding his own Triumph Thunderbird 6T motorcycle. Triumph&#x27;s importers were ambivalent at the exposure, as the subject matter was rowdy motorcycle gangs taking over a small town. The film was criticized for its perceived gratuitous violence at the time, with &quot;Time&quot; stating: &quot;The effect of the movie is not to throw light on the public problem, but to shoot adrenaline through the moviegoer&#x27;s veins.&quot; Brando allegedly did not see eye to eye with the Hungarian director László Benedek and did not get on with costar Lee Marvin.

To Brando&#x27;s expressed puzzlement, the movie inspired teen rebellion and made him a role model to the nascent rock-and-roll generation and future stars such as James Dean and Elvis Presley. After the movie&#x27;s release, the sales of leather jackets and motorcycles skyrocketed. Reflecting on the movie in his autobiography, Brando concluded that it had not aged very well but said &quot;More than most parts I&#x27;ve played in the movies or onstage, I related to Johnny, and because of this, I believe I played him as more sensitive and sympathetic than the script envisioned. There&#x27;s a line in the picture where he snarls, &#x27;Nobody tells me what to do.&#x27; That&#x27;s exactly how I&#x27;ve felt all my life.&quot;

Later that same year, Brando co-starred with fellow Studio member William Redfield in a summer stock production of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;.

In 1954, Brando starred in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, a crime drama film about union violence and corruption among longshoremen. The film was directed by Elia Kazan and written by Budd Schulberg; it also starred Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger and, in her film debut, Eva Marie Saint. When initially offered the role, Brando—still stung by Kazan&#x27;s testimony to HUAC—demurred and the part of Terry Malloy nearly went to Frank Sinatra. According to biographer Stefan Kanfer, the director believed that Sinatra, who grew up in Hoboken (where the film takes place and was shot), would work as Malloy, but eventually producer Sam Spiegel wooed Brando to the part, signing him for $100,000. &quot;Kazan made no protest because, he subsequently confessed, &#x27;I always preferred Brando to anybody.&#x27;&quot;
Brando won the Oscar for his role as Irish-American stevedore Terry Malloy in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. His performance, spurred on by his rapport with Eva Marie Saint and Kazan&#x27;s direction, was praised as a &quot;tour de force&quot;. For the scene in which Terry laments his failings, saying &quot;I coulda been a contender&quot;, he convinced Kazan that the scripted scene was unrealistic. Schulberg&#x27;s script had Brando acting the entire scene with his character being held at gunpoint by his brother Charlie, played by Rod Steiger. Brando insisted on gently pushing away the gun, saying that Terry would never believe that his brother would pull the trigger and doubting that he could continue his speech while fearing a gun on him. Kazan let Brando improvise and later expressed deep admiration for Brando&#x27;s instinctive understanding, saying:

Upon its release, &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; received glowing reviews from critics and was a commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1954. In his July 29, 1954, review, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic A. H. Weiler praised the film, calling it &quot;an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert lauded the film retrospectively, stating that Brando and Kazan changed acting in American films forever and adding it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list. In his autobiography, Brando was typically dismissive of his performance: &quot;On the day Gadg showed me the complete picture, I was so depressed by my performance I got up and left the screening room ... I thought I was a huge failure.&quot; After Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor, the statue was stolen. Much later, it turned up at a London auction house, which contacted the actor and informed him of its whereabouts.

=== 1954–1959: Box office success ===
Brando portrayed Napoleon in the 1954 film &quot;Désirée&quot;.

Brando was in the film adaptation of the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955). &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; would be Brando&#x27;s first and last musical role. &quot;Time&quot; found the picture &quot;false to the original in its feeling&quot;, remarking that Brando &quot;sings in a faraway tenor that sometimes tends to be flat&quot;. Appearing in Edward Murrow&#x27;s &quot;Person to Person&quot; interview in early 1955, he admitted to having problems with his singing voice, which he called &quot;pretty terrible&quot;. In the 1965 documentary &quot;Meet Marlon Brando&quot;, he revealed that the final product heard in the movie was a result of countless singing takes being cut into one and later joked, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t hit a note with a baseball bat; some notes I missed by extraordinary margins ... They sewed my words together on one song so tightly that when I mouthed it in front of the camera, I nearly asphyxiated myself&quot;. Relations between Brando and costar Frank Sinatra were also frosty, with Stefan Kanfer observing: &quot;The two men were diametrical opposites: Marlon required multiple takes; Frank detested repeating himself.&quot; Upon their first meeting Sinatra reportedly scoffed, &quot;Don&#x27;t give me any of that Actors Studio shit.&quot; Brando later quipped, &quot;Frank is the kind of guy, when he dies, he&#x27;s going to heaven and give God a hard time for making him bald.&quot; Frank Sinatra called Brando &quot;the world&#x27;s most overrated actor&quot;, and referred to him as &quot;mumbles&quot;. The film was commercially though not critically successful, costing $5.5 million to make and grossing $13 million.

Brando played Sakini, a Japanese interpreter for the U.S. Army in postwar Japan, in &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; (1956). Pauline Kael was not particularly impressed by the movie, but noted &quot;Marlon Brando starved himself to play the pixie interpreter Sakini, and he looks as if he&#x27;s enjoying the stunt—talking with a mad accent, grinning boyishly, bending forward, and doing tricky movements with his legs. He&#x27;s harmlessly genial (and he is certainly missed when he&#x27;s offscreen), though the fey, roguish role doesn&#x27;t allow him to do what he&#x27;s great at and it&#x27;s possible that he&#x27;s less effective in it than a lesser actor might have been.&quot;

In &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1957), Brando appeared as a United States Air Force officer. &quot;Newsweek&quot; found the film a &quot;dull tale of the meeting of the twain&quot;, but it was nevertheless a box-office success. According to Stefan Kanfer&#x27;s biography of the actor, Brando&#x27;s manager Jay Kanter negotiated a profitable contract with ten percent of the gross going to Brando, which put him in the millionaire category. The movie was controversial due to openly discussing interracial marriage, but proved a great success, earning 10 Academy Award nominations, with Brando being nominated for Best Actor. The film went on to win four Academy Awards. &quot;Teahouse&quot; and &quot;Sayonara&quot; were the first in a string of films Brando would strive to make over the next decade which contained socially relevant messages, and he formed a partnership with Paramount to establish his own production company called Pennebaker, its declared purpose to develop films that contained &quot;social value that would improve the world.&quot; The name was a tribute in honor of his mother, who had died in 1954. By all accounts, Brando was devastated by her death, with biographer Peter Manso telling A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot;, &quot;She was the one who could give him approval like no one else could and, after his mother died, it seems that Marlon stops caring.&quot; Brando appointed his father to run Pennebaker. In the same A&amp;E special, George Englund claims that Brando gave his father the job because &quot;it gave Marlon a chance to take shots at him, to demean and diminish him&quot;.

In 1958, Brando appeared in &quot;The Young Lions&quot;, dyeing his hair blonde and assuming a German accent for the role, which he later admitted was not convincing. The film is based on the novel by Irwin Shaw, and Brando&#x27;s portrayal of the character Christian Diestl was controversial for its time. He later wrote, &quot;The original script closely followed the book, in which Shaw painted all Germans as evil caricatures, especially Christian, whom he portrayed as a symbol of everything that was bad about Nazism; he was mean, nasty, vicious, a cliché of evil ... I thought the story should demonstrate that there are no inherently &#x27;bad&#x27; people in the world, but they can easily be misled.&quot; Shaw and Brando even appeared together for a televised interview with CBS correspondent David Schoenbrun and, during a bombastic exchange, Shaw charged that, like most actors, Brando was incapable of playing flat-out villainy; Brando responded by stating &quot;Nobody creates a character but an actor. I play the role; now he exists. He is my creation.&quot; &quot;The Young Lions&quot; also features Brando&#x27;s only appearance in a film with friend and rival Montgomery Clift (although they shared no scenes together). Brando closed out the decade by appearing in &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot; (1960) opposite Anna Magnani. The film was based on another play by Tennessee Williams but was hardly the success &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; had been, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; labeling Williams&#x27; personae &quot;psychologically sick or just plain ugly&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; calling it a &quot;cornpone melodrama&quot;.

=== 1961–1971: Established actor ===

In 1961, Brando made his directorial debut in the western &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot;. The picture was originally directed by Stanley Kubrick, but he was fired early in the production. Paramount then made Brando the director. Brando portrays the lead character Rio, and Karl Malden plays his partner &quot;Dad&quot; Longworth. The supporting cast features Katy Jurado, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens. Brando&#x27;s penchant for multiple retakes and character exploration as an actor carried over into his directing, however, and the film soon went over budget; Paramount expected the film to take three months to complete but shooting stretched to six and the cost doubled to more than six million dollars. Brando&#x27;s inexperience as an editor also delayed postproduction and Paramount eventually took control of the film. Brando later wrote, &quot;Paramount said it didn&#x27;t like my version of the story; I&#x27;d had everyone lie except Karl Malden. The studio cut the movie to pieces and made him a liar, too. By then, I was bored with the whole project and walked away from it&quot;. &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; was received with mixed reviews by critics.

Brando&#x27;s revulsion with the film industry reportedly boiled over on the set of his next film, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s remake of &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, which was filmed in Tahiti. The actor was accused of deliberately sabotaging nearly every aspect of the production. On June 16, 1962, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; ran an article by Bill Davidson with the headline &quot;Six million dollars down the drain: the mutiny of Marlon Brando&quot;. &quot;Mutiny&quot; director Lewis Milestone claimed that the executives &quot;deserve what they get when they give a ham actor, a petulant child, complete control over an expensive picture.&quot; &quot; Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; nearly capsized MGM and, while the project had indeed been hampered with delays other than Brando&#x27;s behavior, the accusations would dog the actor for years as studios began to fear Brando&#x27;s difficult reputation. Critics also began taking note of his fluctuating weight.

Distracted by his personal life and becoming disillusioned with his career, Brando began to view acting as a means to a financial end. Critics protested when he started accepting roles in films many perceived as being beneath his talent, or criticized him for failing to live up to the better roles. Previously only signing short-term deals with film studios, in 1961 Brando uncharacteristically signed a five-picture deal with Universal Studios that would haunt him for the rest of the decade. &quot;The Ugly American&quot; (1963) was the first of these films. Based on the 1958 novel of the same title that Pennebaker had optioned, the film, which featured Brando&#x27;s sister Jocelyn, was rated fairly positively but died at the box office. Brando was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. All of Brando&#x27;s other Universal films during this period, including &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; (1964), &quot;The Appaloosa&quot; (1966), &quot;A Countess from Hong Kong&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Night of the Following Day&quot; (1969), were also critical and commercial flops. &quot;Countess&quot; in particular was a disappointment for Brando, who had looked forward to working with one of his heroes, director Charlie Chaplin. The experience turned out to be an unhappy one; Brando was horrified at Chaplin&#x27;s didactic style of direction and his authoritarian approach. Brando had also appeared in the spy thriller &quot;Morituri&quot; in 1965; that, too, failed to attract an audience.

Brando acknowledged his professional decline, writing later, &quot;Some of the films I made during the sixties were successful; some weren&#x27;t. Some, like &quot;The Night of the Following Day&quot;, I made only for the money; others, like &quot;Candy&quot;, I did because a friend asked me to and I didn&#x27;t want to turn him down ... In some ways I think of my middle age as the Fuck You Years.&quot; &quot;Candy&quot; was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand and based on the 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the film satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando&#x27;s career. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; observed: &quot;Brando&#x27;s self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents.&quot; In the March 1966 issue of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando &quot;was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap&quot;, but now Brando and others like him had become &quot;buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations.&quot; In an earlier review of &quot;The Appaloosa&quot; in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was &quot;trapped in another dog of a movie ... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner.&quot; Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film &quot;Listen to Me Marlon&quot;, &quot;They can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot.&quot;

Brando portrayed a repressed gay army officer in &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot;, directed by John Huston and co-starring Elizabeth Taylor. The role turned out as one of his most acclaimed in years, with Stanley Crouch marveling, &quot;Brando&#x27;s main achievement was to portray the taciturn but stoic gloom of those pulverized by circumstances.&quot; The film overall received mixed reviews. Another notable film was &quot;The Chase&quot; (1966), which paired the actor with director Arthur Penn, Jane Fonda, Robert Redford and Robert Duvall. The film deals with themes of racism, sexual revolution, small-town corruption, and vigilantism. The film was received mostly positively.

Brando cited &quot;Burn!&quot; (1969) as his personal favorite of the films he had made, writing in his autobiography: &quot;I think I did some of the best acting I&#x27;ve ever done in that picture, but few people came to see it.&quot; Brando dedicated a full chapter to the film in his memoir, stating that the director, Gillo Pontecorvo, was the best director he had ever worked with next to Kazan and Bernardo Bertolucci. Brando also detailed his clashes with Pontecorvo on the set and how &quot;we nearly killed each other.&quot; Loosely based on events in the history of Guadeloupe, the film got a hostile reception from critics. In 1971, Michael Winner directed him in the British horror film &quot;The Nightcomers&quot; with Stephanie Beacham, Thora Hird, Harry Andrews and Anna Palk. It is a prequel to &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, which had previously been filmed as &quot;The Innocents&quot; (1961). Brando&#x27;s performance earned him a nomination for a Best Actor BAFTA, but the film bombed at the box office.

===1970–1979: Career resurgence and acclaim===
During the 1970s, Brando was considered &quot;unbankable&quot;. Critics were becoming increasingly dismissive of his work and he had not appeared in a box office hit since &quot;The Young Lions&quot; in 1958, the last year he had ranked as one of the Top Ten Box Office Stars and the year of his last Academy Award nomination, for &quot;Sayonara.&quot; Brando&#x27;s performance as Vito Corleone, the &quot;Don&quot;, in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s adaptation of Mario Puzo&#x27;s 1969 bestselling novel of the same name, was a career turning point, putting him back in the Top Ten and winning him his second Best Actor Oscar.
Paramount production chief Robert Evans, who had given Puzo an advance to write &quot;The Godfather&quot; so that Paramount would own the film rights, hired Coppola after many major directors had turned the film down. Evans wanted an Italian-American director who could provide the film with cultural authenticity. Coppola also came cheap. Evans was conscious of the fact that Paramount&#x27;s last Mafia film, &quot;The Brotherhood&quot; (1968) had been a box office bomb, and he believed it was partly due to the fact that the director, Martin Ritt, and the star, Kirk Douglas, were Jewish, and the film lacked an authentic Italian flavor. The studio originally intended the film to be a low-budget production set in contemporary times without any major actors, but the phenomenal success of the novel gave Evans the clout to turn &quot;The Godfather&quot; into a prestige picture.

Coppola had developed a list of actors for all the roles, and his list of potential Dons included the Oscar-winning Italian-American Ernest Borgnine, the Italian-American Frank de Kova (best known for playing Chief Wild Eagle on the TV sitcom &quot;F-Troop&quot;), John Marley (a Best Supporting Oscar-nominee for Paramount&#x27;s 1970 hit film &quot;Love Story&quot; who was cast as the film producer Jack Woltz in the picture), the Italian-American Richard Conte (who was cast as Don Corleone&#x27;s deadly rival Don Emilio Barzini), and Italian film producer Carlo Ponti. Coppola admitted in a 1975 interview, &quot;We finally figured we had to lure the &quot;best&quot; actor in the world. It was that simple. That boiled down to Laurence Olivier or Marlon Brando, who &quot;are&quot; the greatest actors in the world.&quot; Coppola&#x27;s hand-written cast list has Brando&#x27;s name underlined.

Evans told Coppola that he had been thinking of Brando for the part two years earlier, and Puzo had imagined Brando in the part when he wrote the novel and had actually written to him about the part, so Coppola and Evans narrowed it down to Brando. (Coincidentally, Olivier would compete with Brando for the Best Actor Oscar for his part in &quot;Sleuth.&quot; He bested Brando at the 1972 New York Film Critics Circle Awards.) Albert S. Ruddy, whom Paramount assigned to produce the film, agreed with the choice of Brando. However, Paramount studio executives were opposed to casting Brando, due to his reputation for difficulty and his long string of box office flops. Brando also had &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; working against him, a troubled production that lost money for Paramount when it was released in 1961. Paramount Pictures President Stanley Jaffe told an exasperated Coppola &quot;As long as I&#x27;m president of this studio, Marlon Brando will not be in this picture, and I will no longer allow you to discuss it.&quot;

Jaffe eventually set three conditions for the casting of Brando: That he would have to take a fee far below what he typically received; he would have to agree to accept financial responsibility for any production delays his behavior cost; and he had to submit to a screen test. Coppola convinced Brando to do a videotaped &quot;make-up&quot; test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the character&#x27;s puffed cheeks). Coppola had feared Brando might be too young to play the Don, but was electrified by the actor&#x27;s characterization as the head of a crime family. Even so, he had to fight the studio in order to cast the temperamental actor. Brando had doubts himself, stating in his autobiography, &quot;I had never played an Italian before, and I didn&#x27;t think I could do it successfully.&quot; Eventually, Charles Bluhdorn, the president of Paramount parent Gulf+Western, was won over to letting Brando have the role; when he saw the screen test, he asked in amazement, &quot;What are we watching? Who is this old guinea?&quot; Brando was signed for a low fee of $50,000, but in his contract, he was given a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale: 1% of the gross for each $10 million over a $10 million threshold, up to 5% if the picture exceeded $60 million. According to Evans, Brando sold back his points in the picture for $100,000, as he was in dire need of funds. &quot;That $100,000 cost him $11 million,&quot; Evans claimed.

Brando was on his best behavior during filming, buoyed by a cast that included rising stars Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton. As the most seasoned actor on set, he wielded his influence to support the creatives on the project, serving as the &quot;head of the family&quot; much like his role in the film. In a 1994 interview, Coppola insisted &quot;The Godfather&quot; was &quot;a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn&#x27;t like the cast. They didn&#x27;t like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired.&quot; When word of this executive interference reached Brando, he threatened to walk off the picture, writing in his memoir: &quot;I strongly believe that directors are entitled to independence and freedom to realize their vision.&quot; Similarly, in a 2010 interview, Al Pacino discussed how Brando&#x27;s support helped him keep the role of Michael Corleone in the movie, despite the fact Coppola wanted to fire him due to pressure from studio executives who were puzzled by Pacino&#x27;s performance. 

Brando&#x27;s performance was glowingly reviewed by critics. &quot;I thought it would be interesting to play a gangster, maybe for the first time in the movies, who wasn&#x27;t like those bad guys Edward G. Robinson played, but who is kind of a hero, a man to be respected,&quot; Brando recalled in his autobiography. &quot;Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I thought it would be an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike Al Capone, who beat up people with baseball bats.&quot; Duvall later marveled to A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot;, &quot;He minimized the sense of beginning. In other words he, like, deemphasized the word &quot;action&quot;. He would go in front of that camera just like he was before. &quot;Cut!&quot; It was all the same. There was really no beginning. I learned a lot from watching that.&quot; Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but he declined it, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (after George C. Scott for &quot;Patton&quot;). Brando did not attend the award ceremony; instead, he sent actress Sacheen Littlefeather (who appeared in Plains Indian-style regalia) to decline the Oscar on his behalf. After refusing to touch the statue at the podium, she announced to the crowd that Brando was rejecting the award in protest of &quot;the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry ... and on television and movie reruns and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee.&quot; The Wounded Knee Occupation of 1973 was occurring at the time of the ceremony. Brando had written a longer speech for her to read but, as she explained, this was not permitted due to time constraints. In the written speech Brando added that he hoped his declining the Oscar would be seen as &quot;an earnest effort to focus attention on an issue that might very well determine whether or not this country has the right to say from this point forward we believe in the inalienable rights of all people to remain free and independent on lands that have supported their life beyond living memory.&quot;

The actor followed &quot;The Godfather&quot; with Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, playing opposite Maria Schneider, but Brando&#x27;s highly noted performance threatened to be overshadowed by an uproar over the sexual content of the film. Brando portrays a recent American widower named Paul, who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young, betrothed Parisian woman named Jeanne. As with previous films, Brando refused to memorize his lines for many scenes; instead, he wrote his lines on cue cards and posted them around the set for easy reference, leaving Bertolucci with the problem of keeping them out of the picture frame. The film features several intense, graphic scenes involving Brando, including Paul anally raping Jeanne using butter as a lubricant, which it was alleged was not consensual. The actress confirmed that no actual sex occurred, but she complained that she was not told what the scene would include until shortly prior to filming.

Bertolucci also shot a scene which showed Brando&#x27;s genitals, but in 1973 explained, &quot;I had so identified myself with Brando that I cut it out of shame for myself. To show him naked would have been like showing me naked.&quot; Schneider declared in an interview that &quot;Marlon said he felt raped and manipulated by it and he was 48. And he was Marlon Brando!&quot;. Like Schneider, Brando confirmed that the sex was simulated. Bertolucci said about Brando that he was &quot;a monster as an actor and a darling as a human being&quot;. Brando refused to speak to Bertolucci for 15 years after the production was completed. Bertolucci said:

However; &quot;I called him one day in &#x27;93, I think, I was in LA and my wife was shooting a movie. First of all, he answered the phone, and he was talking to me like we had seen each other a day earlier. He said, &quot;Come here.&quot; I said, &quot;When?&quot; He said, &quot;Now.&quot; So I remember driving on Mulholland Drive to his home and thinking I think I won&#x27;t make it, I think I will crash before [I get there]. I was so emotional.&quot; The film also features Paul&#x27;s angry, emotionally charged final confrontation with the corpse of his dead wife. The controversial movie was a hit however, and Brando made the list of Top Ten Box Office Stars for the last time. His gross participation deal earned him $3 million. The voting membership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences again nominated Brando for Best Actor, his seventh nomination. Brando won the 1973 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.

Pauline Kael, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; review, wrote &quot;The movie breakthrough has finally come. Bertolucci and Brando have altered the face of an art form.&quot; Brando confessed in his autobiography, &quot;To this day I can&#x27;t say what &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; was about&quot;, and added the film &quot;required me to do a lot of emotional arm wrestling with myself, and when it was finished, I decided that I wasn&#x27;t ever again going to destroy myself emotionally to make a movie&quot;. In 1973, Brando was devastated by the death of his childhood best friend Wally Cox. Brando wrenched his ashes from his widow, who was going to sue for their return, but finally said, &quot;Marlon needed the ashes more than I did.&quot;

In 1976, Brando appeared in &quot;The Missouri Breaks&quot; with his friend Jack Nicholson. The movie also reunited the actor with director Arthur Penn. As biographer Stefan Kanfer describes, Penn had difficulty controlling Brando, who seemed intent on going over the top with his border-ruffian-turned-contract-killer Robert E. Lee Clayton: &quot;Marlon made him a cross-dressing psychopath. Absent for the first hour of the movie, Clayton enters on horseback, dangling upside down, caparisoned in white buckskin, Littlefeather-style. He speaks in an Irish accent for no apparent reason. Over the next hour, also for no apparent reason, Clayton assumes the intonation of a British upper-class twit and an elderly frontier woman, complete with a granny dress and matching bonnet. Penn, who believed in letting actors do their thing, indulged Marlon all the way.&quot; Critics were unkind, with &quot;The Observer&quot; calling Brando&#x27;s performance &quot;one of the most extravagant displays of &quot;grandedamerie&quot; since Sarah Bernhardt&quot;, while &quot;The Sun&quot; complained, &quot;Marlon Brando at fifty-two has the sloppy belly of a sixty-two-year-old, the white hair of a seventy-two-year-old, and the lack of discipline of a precocious twelve-year-old.&quot; However, Kanfer noted: &quot;Even though his late work was met with disapproval, a re-examination shows that often, in the middle of the most pedestrian scene, there would be a sudden, luminous occurrence, a flash of the old Marlon that showed how capable he remained.&quot;

In 1978, Brando narrated the English version of &quot;Raoni&quot;, a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the Indigenous tribes in north central Brazil. Brando portrayed Superman&#x27;s father Jor-El in the 1978 film &quot;Superman&quot;. He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and that his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. It was revealed in a documentary contained in the 2001 DVD release of &quot;Superman&quot; that he was paid $3.7 million for two weeks of work. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Superman II&quot;, but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage. &quot;I asked for my usual percentage,&quot; he recollected in his memoir, &quot;but they refused, and so did I.&quot; However, after Brando&#x27;s death, the footage was reincorporated into the 2006 recut of the film, &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot; and in the 2006 &quot;loose sequel&quot; &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, in which both used and unused archive footage of him as Jor-El from the first two &quot;Superman&quot; films was remastered for a scene in the Fortress of Solitude, and Brando&#x27;s voice-overs were used throughout the film. In 1979, he made a rare television appearance in the miniseries &quot;&quot;, portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance.

Brando starred as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s Vietnam epic &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979). He plays a highly decorated U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military as much as the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1 million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as Eleanor Coppola&#x27;s documentary &quot;Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot; details: Brando showed up on the set overweight, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film&#x27;s release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself, with Coppola commentating that &quot;He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised me that he was going to get in shape and I imagined that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was &quot;so&quot; fat, he was very, very shy about it ... He was very, very adamant about how he didn&#x27;t want to portray himself that way.&quot; Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor&#x27;s financial benefit, according to producer Fred Roos: &quot;The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we&#x27;d go into this very expensive overage ... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by. And this is at Marlon&#x27;s urging—and yet he&#x27;s getting paid for it.&quot;

Upon release, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; earned critical acclaim, as did Brando&#x27;s performance. His whispering of Kurtz&#x27;s final words &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot;, has become particularly famous. Roger Ebert, writing in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, defended the movie&#x27;s controversial denouement, opining that the ending, &quot;with Brando&#x27;s fuzzy, brooding monologues and the final violence, feels much more satisfactory than any conventional ending possibly could.&quot; Brando received a fee of $2 million plus 10% of the gross theatrical rental and 10% of the TV sale rights, earning him around $9 million.

===1980–2001: Later work and final roles===
After appearing as oil tycoon Adam Steiffel in 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Formula&quot;, which was poorly received critically, Brando announced his retirement from acting. However, he returned in 1989 in &quot;A Dry White Season&quot;, based on André Brink&#x27;s 1979 anti-apartheid novel. Brando agreed to do the film for free, but fell out with director Euzhan Palcy over how the film was edited; he even made a rare television appearance in an interview with Connie Chung to voice his disapproval. In his memoir, he maintained that Palcy &quot;had cut the picture so poorly, I thought, that the inherent drama of this conflict was vague at best.&quot; Brando received praise for his performance, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and winning the Best Actor Award at the Tokyo Film Festival.

Brando scored enthusiastic reviews for his caricature of his Vito Corleone role as Carmine Sabatini in 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Freshman.&quot; In his original review, Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;There have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts—but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in &quot;The Freshman&quot;?&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; also praised Brando&#x27;s performance as Sabatini and noted, &quot;Marlon Brando&#x27;s sublime comedy performance elevates &quot;The Freshman&quot; from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history.&quot; Brando starred alongside his friend Johnny Depp on the box office hit &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot; (1995), in which he also shared credits with singer Selena in her only filming appearance, and in Depp&#x27;s controversial &quot;The Brave&quot; (1997), which was never released in the United States.

Later performances, such as his appearance in &quot;Christopher Columbus: The Discovery&quot; (1992) (for which he was nominated for a Raspberry as &quot;Worst Supporting Actor&quot;), &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; (in which he won a &quot;Worst Supporting Actor&quot; Raspberry) (1996), and his barely recognizable appearance in &quot;Free Money&quot; (1998), resulted in some of the worst reviews of his career. &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; screenwriter Ron Hutchinson would later say in his memoir, &quot;Clinging to the Iceberg: Writing for a Living on the Stage and in Hollywood&quot; (2017), that Brando sabotaged the film&#x27;s production by feuding and refusing to cooperate with his colleagues and the film crew.

Unlike its immediate predecessors, Brando&#x27;s last completed film, &quot;The Score&quot; (2001), was received generally positively. In the film, in which he portrays a fence, he starred with Robert De Niro. After Brando&#x27;s death, the novel &quot;Fan-Tan&quot; was released. Brando conceived the novel with director Donald Cammell in 1979, but it was not released until 2005.

==Later life==
Brando&#x27;s notoriety, his troubled family life and his obesity attracted more attention than his later acting career. He gained a great deal of weight in the 1970s; by the early-to-mid-1990s, he weighed over and suffered from Type 2 diabetes. He had a history of weight fluctuation throughout his career that, by and large, he attributed to his years of stress-related overeating, followed by compensatory dieting. He also earned a reputation for being difficult on the set, often unwilling or unable to memorize his lines and less interested in taking direction than in confronting the film director with odd demands. He also dabbled with some innovation in his last years. He had several patents issued in his name from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, all of which involve a method of tensioning drumheads, between June 2002 and November 2004 (for example, see ). His assistant, Alice Marchak, resigned from her role due to his eccentric and unpredictable behavior. Brando also made sketches and art as hobby.

In 2004, Brando recorded voice tracks for the character Mrs. Sour in the unreleased animated film &quot;Big Bug Man&quot;. This was his last role and his only role as a female character. A longtime close friend of entertainer Michael Jackson, Brando paid regular visits to his Neverland Ranch, resting there for weeks at a time. Brando also participated in the singer&#x27;s two-day solo career 30th-anniversary celebration concerts in 2001 and starred in his 13-minute-long music video &quot;You Rock My World&quot;, in the same year.

Brando&#x27;s son Miko was Jackson&#x27;s bodyguard and assistant for several years and was a friend of the singer. &quot;The last time my father left his house to go anywhere, to spend any kind of time, it was with Michael Jackson&quot;, Miko stated. &quot;He loved it ... He had a 24-hour chef, 24-hour security, 24-hour help, 24-hour kitchen, 24-hour maid service. Just carte blanche.&quot; &quot;Michael was instrumental helping my father through the last few years of his life. For that I will always be indebted to him. Dad had a hard time breathing in his final days and he was on oxygen much of the time. He loved the outdoors, so Michael would invite him over to Neverland. Dad could name all the trees there and the flowers, but being on oxygen it was hard for him to get around and see them all, it&#x27;s such a big place. So Michael got Dad a golf cart with a portable oxygen tank so he could go around and enjoy Neverland. They&#x27;d just drive around—Michael Jackson, Marlon Brando, with an oxygen tank in a golf cart.&quot; In April 2001, Brando was hospitalized with pneumonia. In 2004, Brando signed with film director Ridha Behi and began preproduction on a project to be titled &quot;Brando and Brando&quot;. Up to a week before his death, he was working on the script in anticipation of a July/August 2004 start date. Production was suspended in July 2004 following Brando&#x27;s death, at which time Behi stated that he would continue the film as an homage to Brando, with a new title of &quot;Citizen Brando&quot;, which ultimately became &quot;Always Brando&quot;.

==Death==
On July 1, 2004, Brando died of respiratory failure from pulmonary fibrosis with congestive heart failure at the UCLA Medical Center. The cause of death was initially withheld, with his lawyer citing privacy concerns. He also suffered from diabetes and liver cancer. Shortly before his death and despite needing an oxygen mask to breathe, he recorded his voice to appear in &quot;The Godfather: The Game&quot;, once again as Don Vito Corleone. Brando recorded only one line due to his health and an impersonator was hired to finish his lines. His single recorded line was included within the final game as a tribute to the actor. Some additional lines from his character were directly lifted from the film. Karl Malden—Brando&#x27;s co-star in three films (&quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, and &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot;)—spoke in a documentary accompanying the DVD of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; about a phone call he received from Brando shortly before Brando&#x27;s death. A distressed Brando told Malden he kept falling over. Malden wanted to come over, but Brando put him off, telling him there was no point. Three weeks later, Brando was dead. Shortly before his death, he had apparently refused permission for tubes carrying oxygen to be inserted into his lungs, which, he was told, was the only way to prolong his life.

Brando was cremated and his ashes were put in with those of Wally Cox. They were then scattered partly in Tahiti and partly in Death Valley.

==Personal life==
Brando was known for his tumultuous personal life, his poor treatment of women, and his large number of partners and children. He was the father to at least 11 children, three of whom were adopted. In 1976, he told a French journalist, &quot;Homosexuality is so much in fashion, it no longer makes news. Like a large number of men, I, too, have had homosexual experiences, and I am not ashamed. I have never paid much attention to what people think about me. But if there is someone who is convinced that Jack Nicholson and I are lovers, may they continue to do so. I find it amusing.&quot;

During the 1947 production of &quot;A Streetcar Named&quot; Desire, Brando became enamored with fellow cast member Sandy Campbell, who played the minor role of the young collector. Brando had asked Campbell to have an affair with him and was often seen standing in the wings with Campbell and holding his hand. According to Truman Capote, both Campbell and Brando confessed to having been in a sexual relationship. &quot;I asked Marlon, and he admitted it. He said he went to bed with lots of other men, too, but that he didn&#x27;t consider himself a homosexual. He said they were all so attracted to him. &#x27;I just thought that I was doing them a favor,&#x27; he said.&quot; In his 1957 interview with Brando for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Capote claimed to have first encountered Brando at a rehearsal for &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; while Brando was sleeping on a table on the stage in an empty auditorium. However, the story was appropriated from Sandy Campbell, as confirmed by Campbell&#x27;s partner, Donald Windham.

In &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot;, Brando wrote that he met Marilyn Monroe at a party where she played piano, unnoticed by anybody else there, that they had an affair and maintained an intermittent relationship until her death in 1962, and that he received a telephone call from her two or three days before she died. He also claimed numerous other romances, although he did not discuss his marriages, his wives or his children in his autobiography.

He met nisei actress and dancer Reiko Sato in the early 1950s. Though their relationship cooled, they remained friends for the rest of Sato&#x27;s life, with Sato dividing her time between Los Angeles and Tetiʻaroa in her later years. 
Brando was smitten with the Mexican actress Katy Jurado after seeing her in &quot;High Noon&quot;. They met when Brando was filming &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; in Mexico. Brando told Joseph L. Mankiewicz that he was attracted to &quot;her enigmatic eyes, black as hell, pointing at you like fiery arrows&quot;. Their first date became the beginning of an extended affair that lasted many years and peaked at the time they worked together on &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; (1961), a film directed by Brando.

Brando met actress Rita Moreno in 1954, and they began a love affair. Moreno later revealed in her memoir that when she became pregnant by Brando, he arranged for an abortion. After the abortion was botched, and Brando fell in love with Tarita Teriipaia, Moreno attempted suicide by overdosing on Brando&#x27;s sleeping pills. Years after they broke up, Moreno played his love interest in the film &quot;The Night of the Following Day&quot;. After their relationship, she accused Brando of significant emotional abuse and of throwing a chair at her after she revealed she had dated Elvis Presley in the past.

Brando was briefly engaged to the 19-year-old French actress Josanne Mariani, whom he met in 1954. They broke their engagement when Brando discovered that his other girlfriend, Anna Kashfi, was pregnant, and went on to marry Kashfi instead in 1957. Brando and Kashfi had a son, Christian Brando, on May 11, 1958; they divorced in 1959.
In 1960, Brando married Movita Castaneda, a Mexican-American actress; the marriage was annulled in 1968, after it was discovered she was still legally married to her first husband Jack Doyle. Castaneda had appeared in the first &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; film in 1935, 27 years before the 1962 remake with Brando as Fletcher Christian. They had two children together: Miko Castaneda Brando (born 1961) and Rebecca Brando (born 1966).

French actress Tarita Teriipaia, who played Brando&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, became his third wife on August 10, 1962. She was twenty years old, 18 years younger than Brando, who was reportedly delighted by her naïveté. Because Teriipaia was a native French speaker, Brando became fluent in the language and gave numerous interviews in French. Brando and Teriipaia had two children together: Simon Teihotu Brando (born 1963) and Tarita Cheyenne Brando (1970–1995). Brando also adopted Teriipaia&#x27;s daughter, Maimiti Brando (born 1977) and niece, Raiatua Brando (born 1982). Brando and Teriipaia divorced in 1972.

After Brando&#x27;s death, the daughter of actress Cynthia Lynn claimed that Brando had a short-lived affair with her mother, who appeared with Brando in &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, and that this affair resulted in her birth in 1964. Throughout the late 1960s and into the early 1980s, he had a tempestuous, long-term relationship with actress Jill Banner.

Brando had a long-term relationship with his housekeeper Maria Cristina Ruiz, with whom he had three children: Ninna Priscilla Brando (born May 13, 1989), Myles Jonathan Brando (born January 16, 1992) and Timothy Gahan Brando (born January 6, 1994). Brando also adopted Petra Brando-Corval (born 1972), the daughter of his assistant Caroline Barrett and novelist James Clavell.

Brando&#x27;s close friendship with Wally Cox was the subject of rumors. Brando told a journalist: &quot;If Wally had been a woman, I would have married him and we would have lived happily ever after.&quot; Writer-editor Beauregard Houston-Montgomery said that while under the influence of marijuana, Brando told him that Cox had been the love of his life. Milagros Tirado &quot;Millie&quot; Beck, Cox&#x27;s second wife, and Patricia Cox Shapiro, Cox&#x27;s third wife, dismissed the suggestion that the love was more than platonic. After Cox died in 1973, Brando turned to Cox&#x27;s widow, Shapiro, and pleaded for permission to scatter Cox&#x27;s ashes in the hiking spots they had once frequented together, to which she agreed. However, 20 years later, to her dismay, she discovered that Brando had kept the ashes nearby instead of scattering them. Following Brando&#x27;s death, in accordance with his wishes, his family scattered both men&#x27;s ashes together in Death Valley, where they had often gone rock hunting.

In 2018, Quincy Jones claimed that Brando had had sexual relationships with James Baldwin, Richard Pryor and Marvin Gaye. Pryor&#x27;s widow, Jennifer Lee, confirmed Pryor&#x27;s relationship with Brando, but Pryor&#x27;s daughter, Rain Pryor, disputed that assertion. In February 2024, actor Billy Dee Williams said Brando had propositioned him, which he rejected, while the two were at Brando&#x27;s home during a party.

Brando&#x27;s grandson Tuki Brando (born 1990), son of Cheyenne Brando, is a fashion model. His numerous grandchildren also include Prudence Brando and Shane Brando, children of Miko C. Brando; the children of Rebecca Brando; and the three children of Teihotu Brando among others.

Stephen Blackehart has been reported to be the son of Brando, but Blackehart disputes this claim.

===Lifestyle===
Brando earned a reputation as a &quot;bad boy&quot; for his public outbursts and antics. According to &quot;Los Angeles&quot;: &quot;Brando was rock and roll before anybody knew what rock and roll was.&quot; His behavior during the filming of &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962) seemed to bolster his reputation as a difficult star. He was blamed for a change in director and a runaway budget, though he denied responsibility for both. On June 12, 1973, Brando broke paparazzo Ron Galella&#x27;s jaw. Galella had followed Brando, who was accompanied by talk show host Dick Cavett, after a taping of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in New York City. He paid a $40,000 out-of-court settlement and suffered an infected hand as a result. Galella wore a football helmet the next time he photographed Brando at a gala benefiting the American Indians Development Association in 1974.

The filming of &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; affected Brando&#x27;s life in a profound way, as he fell in love with Tahiti and its people. He bought a twelve-island atoll, Tetiaroa, and in 1970, hired a Los Angeles architect, Bernard Judge, to build his home and natural village there without despoiling the environment. An environmental laboratory protecting sea birds and turtles was established, and for many years student groups visited. The 1983 hurricane destroyed many of the structures, including his resort. A hotel using Brando&#x27;s name, The Brando Resort opened in 2014. Brando was an active ham radio operator, with the call signs KE6PZH and FO5GJ (the latter from his island). He was listed in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) records as Martin Brandeaux to preserve his privacy.

In the A&amp;E &quot;Biography&quot; episode on Brando, biographer Peter Manso comments: &quot;On the one hand, being a celebrity allowed Marlon to take his revenge on the world that had so deeply hurt him, so deeply scarred him. On the other hand he hated it because he knew it was false and ephemeral.&quot; In the same program another biographer, David Thomson, says: Many, many people who worked with him, and came to work with him with the best intentions, went away in despair saying he&#x27;s a spoiled kid. It has to be done his way or he goes away with some vast story about how he was wronged, he was offended, and I think that fits with the psychological pattern that he was a wronged kid.

===Activism===
In 1946, Brando performed in Ben Hecht&#x27;s Zionist play &quot;A Flag Is Born&quot;. He attended some fundraisers for John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election. In August 1963, he participated in the March on Washington along with fellow celebrities Harry Belafonte, James Garner, Charlton Heston, Burt Lancaster and Sidney Poitier. Along with Paul Newman, Brando also participated in the Freedom Rides. Brando supported Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.
In autumn of 1967, Brando visited Helsinki, Finland at a charity party organized by UNICEF at the Helsinki City Theatre. The gala was televised in thirteen countries. Brando&#x27;s visit was based on the famine he had seen in Bihar, India, and he presented the film he shot there to the press and invited guests. He spoke in favor of children&#x27;s rights and development aid in developing countries.

In the aftermath of the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Brando made one of the strongest commitments to furthering King&#x27;s work. Shortly after King&#x27;s death, he announced that he was bowing out of the lead role of a major film, &quot;The Arrangement&quot; (1969), which was about to begin production, to devote himself to the civil rights movement. &quot;I felt I&#x27;d better go find out where it is; what it is to be black in this country; what this rage is all about,&quot; Brando said on the late-night ABC-TV talk show &quot;Joey Bishop Show&quot;. In A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot; episode on Brando, actor and co-star Martin Sheen states: &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget the night that Reverend King was shot and I turned on the news and Marlon was walking through Harlem with Mayor Lindsay. And there were snipers and there was a lot of unrest and he kept walking and talking through those neighborhoods with Mayor Lindsay. It was one of the most incredible acts of courage I ever saw, and it meant a lot and did a lot.&quot;

Brando&#x27;s participation in the civil rights movement actually began well before King&#x27;s death. In the early 1960s, he contributed thousands of dollars to both the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (S.C.L.C.) and to a scholarship fund established for the children of slain Mississippi N.A.A.C.P. leader Medgar Evers. In 1964, Brando was arrested at a &quot;fish-in&quot; held to protest a broken treaty that had promised Native Americans fishing rights in Puget Sound. By this time, Brando was already involved in films that carried messages about human rights: &quot;Sayonara&quot;, which addressed interracial romance, and &quot;The Ugly American&quot;, depicting the conduct of U.S. officials abroad and the deleterious effect on the citizens of foreign countries. For a time, he was also donating money to the Black Panther Party and considered himself a friend of founder Bobby Seale. He also gave a eulogy after Bobby Hutton was shot by the police.
Brando was also a supporter of Native American rights and the American Indian Movement. The March 1964 fish-in protest near Tacoma, Washington, where he was arrested while protesting for fishing treaty rights, won him respect from members of the Puyallup tribe, who reportedly dubbed the spot where he was arrested &quot;Brando&#x27;s Landing.&quot; At the 1973 Academy Awards ceremony, Brando refused to accept the Oscar for his career-reviving performance in &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Sacheen Littlefeather represented him at the ceremony. She appeared in full Apache attire and stated that owing to the &quot;poor treatment of Native Americans in the film industry&quot;, Brando would not accept the award. This occurred while the standoff at Wounded Knee was ongoing. The event grabbed the attention of the US and the world media. This was considered a major event and victory for the movement by its supporters and participants.

Outside of his film work, Brando appeared before the California Assembly in support of a fair housing law, and personally joined picket lines in demonstrations protesting discrimination in housing developments in 1963.

He was also an activist against apartheid. In 1964, he favored a boycott of his films in South Africa to prevent them from being shown to a segregated audience. He took part at a 1975 protest rally against American investments in South Africa and for the release of Nelson Mandela. In 1989, Brando also starred in the film &quot;A Dry White Season&quot;, based upon André Brink&#x27;s novel of the same name.

===Comments on Jews and Hollywood===
In an interview in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in January 1979, Brando said: &quot;You&#x27;ve seen every single race besmirched, but you never saw an image of the kike because the Jews were ever so watchful for that—and rightly so. They never allowed it to be shown on screen. The Jews have done so much for the world that, I suppose, you get extra disappointed because they didn&#x27;t pay attention to that.&quot;

Brando made a similar comment on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; in April 1996, saying: 

Larry King, who was Jewish, replied: &quot;When you say—when you say something like that, you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews are—&quot; Brando interrupted: &quot;No, no, because I will be the first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say &#x27;Thank God for the Jews&#x27;.&quot;

Jay Kanter, Brando&#x27;s agent, producer, and friend, defended him in &quot;Daily Variety&quot;: &quot;Marlon has spoken to me for hours about his fondness for the Jewish people, and he is a well-known supporter of Israel&quot;; Kanter himself was Jewish. Similarly, Louie Kemp, in his article for &quot;Jewish Journal&quot;, wrote: &quot;You might remember him as Don Vito Corleone, Stanley Kowalski or the eerie Col. Walter E. Kurtz in &#x27;Apocalypse Now&#x27;, but I remember Marlon Brando as a mensch and a personal friend of the Jewish people when they needed it most.&quot;

==Legacy==
Brando was one of the most respected actors of the post-war era. He is listed by the American Film Institute as the fourth greatest male star whose screen debut occurred before or during 1950 (it occurred in 1950). He earned respect among critics for his memorable performances and charismatic screen presence. He helped popularize &#x27;method acting&#x27;. He is regarded as one of the greatest cinema actors of the 20th century. Furthermore, he was one of only six actors named in 1999 by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in its list of the 100 Most Important People of the Century. In this list, &quot;Time&quot; also designated Brando as the &quot;Actor of the Century&quot;.

&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describes him as &quot;the most celebrated of the method actors, and his slurred, mumbling delivery marked his rejection of classical dramatic training. His true and passionate performances proved him one of the greatest actors of his generation.&quot; It also notes the apparent paradox of his talent: &quot;He is regarded as the most influential actor of his generation, yet his open disdain for the acting profession ... often manifested itself in the form of questionable choices and uninspired performances. Nevertheless, he remains a riveting screen presence with a vast emotional range and an endless array of compulsively watchable idiosyncrasies.&quot;

===Cultural influence===
Marlon Brando is a cultural icon with enduring popularity. His rise to national attention in the 1950s had a profound effect on American culture. According to film critic Pauline Kael, &quot;Brando represented a reaction against the post-war mania for security. As a protagonist, the Brando of the early fifties had no code, only his instincts. He was a development from the gangster leader and the outlaw. He was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap ... Brando represented a contemporary version of the free American ... Brando is still the most exciting American actor on the screen.&quot;

Sociologist Suzanne McDonald-Walker states: &quot;Marlon Brando, sporting leather jacket, jeans, and moody glare, became a cultural icon summing up &#x27;the road&#x27; in all its maverick glory.&quot; His portrayal of the gang leader Johnny Strabler in &quot;The Wild One&quot; has become an enduring image, used both as a symbol of rebelliousness and a fashion accessory that includes a Perfecto style motorcycle jacket, a tilted cap, jeans and sunglasses. Johnny&#x27;s haircut inspired a craze for sideburns, followed by James Dean and Elvis Presley, among others. Dean copied Brando&#x27;s acting style extensively and Presley used Brando&#x27;s image as a model for his role in &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;. The &quot;I coulda been a contender&quot; scene from &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, according to the author of&quot; Brooklyn Boomer&quot;, Martin H. Levinson, is &quot;one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history, and the line itself has become part of America&#x27;s cultural lexicon.&quot; An example of the endurance of Brando&#x27;s popular &quot;Wild One&quot; image was the 2009 release of replicas of the leather jacket worn by Brando&#x27;s Johnny Strabler character. The jackets were marketed by Triumph, the manufacturer of the Triumph Thunderbird motorcycles featured in &quot;The Wild One&quot;, and were officially licensed by Brando&#x27;s estate.

Brando was also considered a male sex symbol. Linda Williams writes: &quot;Marlon Brando [was] the quintessential American male sex symbol of the late fifties and early sixties&quot;. Brando was an early lesbian icon who, along with James Dean, influenced the butch look and self-image in the 1950s and after.

Brando has also been immortalized in music; most notably, he was mentioned in the lyrics of &quot;It&#x27;s Hard to Be a Saint in the City&quot; by Bruce Springsteen, in which one of the opening lines read &quot;I could walk like Brando right in to the sun&quot;, and in Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Pocahontas&quot; as a tribute to his lifetime support of Native Americans and in which Brando is depicted sitting by a fire with Young and Pocahontas. Brando was also mentioned in &quot;Vogue&quot; by Madonna, &quot;Is This What You Wanted&quot; by Leonard Cohen on the album New Skin for the Old Ceremony, &quot;Eyeless&quot; by Slipknot on their self-titled album, and most recently in the song simply titled &quot;Marlon Brando&quot; on the Australian singer Alex Cameron&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Forced Witness&quot;. Bob Dylan&#x27;s 2020 song &quot;My Own Version of You&quot; references one of his most famous performances in the line: &quot;I&#x27;ll take the &quot;Scarface&quot; Pacino and the &quot;Godfather&quot; Brando / Mix &#x27;em up in a tank and get a robot commando.&quot;

Brando is also visible on the cover of the Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, among a tableau of celebrities and historical figures.

Brando&#x27;s films, along with those of James Dean, caused Honda to come forward with its &quot;You Meet the Nicest People on a Honda&quot; ads, to curb the negative association motorcycles had gotten with rebels and outlaws.

===Views on acting===
In his autobiography &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot;, Brando observed:
He also confessed that, while having great admiration for the theater, he did not return to it after his initial success primarily because the work left him drained emotionally:

Brando repeatedly credited Stella Adler and her understanding of the Stanislavski acting technique for bringing realism to American cinema, but also added:

In the 2015 documentary &quot;Listen to Me Marlon&quot;, Brando shared his thoughts on playing a death scene, stating, &quot;That&#x27;s a tough scene to play. You have to make &#x27;em believe that you are dying ... Try to think of the most intimate moment you&#x27;ve ever had in your life.&quot; His favorite actors were Spencer Tracy, John Barrymore, Fredric March, James Cagney and Paul Muni. He also showed admiration for Sean Penn, Jack Nicholson, Johnny Depp and Daniel Day-Lewis.

==Acting credits and accolades==
Among the numerous accolades for his acting work, Brando has won two Academy Awards for Best Actor for his role as a longshoreman in the Elia Kazan directed drama &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954) and Vito Corleone in the Francis Ford Coppola directed crime film &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972).

<text>Meteorology is a branch of the atmospheric sciences (which include atmospheric chemistry and physics) with a major focus on weather forecasting. The study of meteorology dates back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not begin until the 18th century. The 19th century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions. Prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data. It was not until after the elucidation of the laws of physics, and more particularly in the latter half of the 20th century, the development of the computer (allowing for the automated solution of a great many modelling equations) that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved. An important branch of weather forecasting is marine weather forecasting as it relates to maritime and coastal safety, in which weather effects also include atmospheric interactions with large bodies of water.

Meteorological phenomena are observable weather events that are explained by the science of meteorology. Meteorological phenomena are described and quantified by the variables of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere: temperature, air pressure, water vapour, mass flow, and the variations and interactions of these variables, and how they change over time. Different spatial scales are used to describe and predict weather on local, regional, and global levels.
Meteorology, climatology, atmospheric physics, and atmospheric chemistry are sub-disciplines of the atmospheric sciences. Meteorology and hydrology compose the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology. The interactions between Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and its oceans are part of a coupled ocean-atmosphere system. Meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military, energy production, transport, agriculture, and construction.

The word &quot;&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;metéōros&quot; (&quot;meteor&quot;) and &quot;-logia&quot; (&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;the study of things high in the air&quot;.

==History==
===Ancient meteorology up to the time of Aristotle===
Early attempts at predicting weather were often related to prophecy and divining, and were sometimes based on astrological ideas. Ancient religions believed meteorological phenomena to be under the control of the gods. The ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier. Early approaches to predicting weather were based on astrology and were practiced by priests. The Egyptians had rain-making rituals as early as 3500 BC. 

Ancient Indian Upanishads contain mentions of clouds and seasons. The Samaveda mentions sacrifices to be performed when certain phenomena were noticed. Varāhamihira&#x27;s classical work &quot;Brihatsamhita&quot;, written about 500 AD, provides evidence of weather observation.

Cuneiform inscriptions on Babylonian tablets included associations between thunder and rain. The Chaldeans differentiated the 22° and 46° halos.

The ancient Greeks were the first to make theories about the weather. Many natural philosophers studied the weather. However, as meteorological instruments did not exist, the inquiry was largely qualitative, and could only be judged by more general theoretical speculations. Herodotus states that Thales predicted the solar eclipse of 585 BC. He studied Babylonian equinox tables. According to Seneca, he gave the explanation that the cause of the Nile&#x27;s annual floods was due to northerly winds hindering its descent by the sea. Anaximander and Anaximenes thought that thunder and lightning was caused by air smashing against the cloud, thus kindling the flame. Early meteorological theories generally considered that there was a fire-like substance in the atmosphere. Anaximander defined wind as a flowing of air, but this was not generally accepted for centuries. A theory to explain summer hail was first proposed by Anaxagoras. He observed that air temperature decreased with increasing height and that clouds contain moisture. He also noted that heat caused objects to rise, and therefore the heat on a summer day would drive clouds to an altitude where the moisture would freeze. Empedocles theorized on the change of the seasons. He believed that fire and water opposed each other in the atmosphere, and when fire gained the upper hand, the result was summer, and when water did, it was winter. Democritus also wrote about the flooding of the Nile. He said that during the summer solstice, snow in northern parts of the world melted. This would cause vapors to form clouds, which would cause storms when driven to the Nile by northerly winds, thus filling the lakes and the Nile. Hippocrates inquired into the effect of weather on health. Eudoxus claimed that bad weather followed four-year periods, according to Pliny.

=== Aristotelian meteorology ===
These early observations would form the basis for Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Meteorology&quot;, written in 350 BC. Aristotle is considered the founder of meteorology. One of the most impressive achievements described in the &quot;Meteorology&quot; is the description of what is now known as the hydrologic cycle. His work would remain an authority on meteorology for nearly 2,000 years.

The book De Mundo (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC) noted:
:If the flashing body is set on fire and rushes violently to the Earth it is called a thunderbolt; if it is only half of fire, but violent also and massive, it is called a &quot;meteor&quot;; if it is entirely free from fire, it is called a smoking bolt. They are all called &#x27;swooping bolts&#x27; because they swoop down upon the Earth. Lightning is sometimes smoky and is then called &#x27;smoldering lightning&quot;; sometimes it darts quickly along and is then said to be &quot;vivid&quot;. At other times, it travels in crooked lines, and is called &quot;forked lightning&quot;. When it swoops down upon some object it is called &#x27;swooping lightning&#x27;

After Aristotle, progress in meteorology stalled for a long time. Theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the &quot;Book of Signs&quot;, as well as &quot;On Winds&quot;. He gave hundreds of signs for weather phenomena for a period up to a year. His system was based on dividing the year by the setting and the rising of the Pleiad, halves into solstices and equinoxes, and the continuity of the weather for those periods. He also divided months into the new moon, fourth day, eighth day and full moon, in likelihood of a change in the weather occurring. The day was divided into sunrise, mid-morning, noon, mid-afternoon and sunset, with corresponding divisions of the night, with change being likely at one of these divisions. Applying the divisions and a principle of balance in the yearly weather, he came up with forecasts like that if a lot of rain falls in the winter, the spring is usually dry. Rules based on actions of animals are also present in his work, like that if a dog rolls on the ground, it is a sign of a storm. Shooting stars and the Moon were also considered significant. However, he made no attempt to explain these phenomena, referring only to the Aristotelian method. The work of Theophrastus remained a dominant influence in weather forecasting for nearly 2,000 years.

=== Meteorology after Aristotle ===
Meteorology continued to be studied and developed over the centuries, but it was not until the Renaissance in the 14th to 17th centuries that significant advancements were made in the field. Scientists such as Galileo and Descartes introduced new methods and ideas, leading to the scientific revolution in meteorology.

Speculation on the cause of the flooding of the Nile ended when Eratosthenes, according to Proclus, stated that it was known that man had gone to the sources of the Nile and observed the rains, although interest in its implications continued.

During the era of Roman Greece and Europe, scientific interest in meteorology waned. In the 1st century BC, most natural philosophers claimed that the clouds and winds extended up to 111 miles, but Posidonius thought that they reached up to five miles, after which the air is clear, liquid and luminous. He closely followed Aristotle&#x27;s theories. By the end of the second century BC, the center of science shifted from Athens to Alexandria, home to the ancient Library of Alexandria. In the 2nd century AD, Ptolemy&#x27;s Almagest dealt with meteorology, because it was considered a subset of astronomy. He gave several astrological weather predictions. He constructed a map of the world divided into climatic zones by their illumination, in which the length of the Summer solstice increased by half an hour per zone between the equator and the Arctic. Ptolemy wrote on the atmospheric refraction of light in the context of astronomical observations.

In 25 AD, Pomponius Mela, a Roman geographer, formalized the climatic zone system. In 63–64 AD, Seneca wrote &quot;Naturales quaestiones&quot;. It was a compilation and synthesis of ancient Greek theories. However, theology was of foremost importance to Seneca, and he believed that phenomena such as lightning were tied to fate. The second book(chapter) of Pliny&#x27;s Natural History covers meteorology. He states that more than twenty ancient Greek authors studied meteorology. He did not make any personal contributions, and the value of his work is in preserving earlier speculation, much like Seneca&#x27;s work.

From 400 to 1100, scientific learning in Europe was preserved by the clergy. Isidore of Seville devoted a considerable attention to meteorology in &quot;Etymologiae&quot;, &quot;De ordine creaturum&quot; and &quot;De natura rerum&quot;. Bede the Venerable was the first Englishman to write about the weather in &quot;De Natura Rerum&quot; in 703. The work was a summary of then extant classical sources. However, Aristotle&#x27;s works were largely lost until the twelfth century, including &quot;Meteorologica&quot;. Isidore and Bede were scientifically minded, but they adhered to the letter of Scripture.

Islamic civilization translated many ancient works into Arabic which were transmitted and translated in western Europe to Latin.

In the 9th century, Al-Dinawari wrote the &quot;Kitab al-Nabat&quot; (Book of Plants), in which he deals with the application of meteorology to agriculture during the Arab Agricultural Revolution. He describes the meteorological character of the sky, the planets and constellations, the sun and moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, the &quot;anwa&quot; (heavenly bodies of rain), and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes.

In 1021, Alhazen showed that atmospheric refraction is also responsible for twilight in &quot;Opticae thesaurus&quot;; he estimated that twilight begins when the sun is 19 degrees below the horizon, and also used a geometric determination based on this to estimate the maximum possible height of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere as 52,000 &quot;passim&quot; (about 49 miles, or 79 km).

Adelard of Bath was one of the early translators of the classics. He also discussed meteorological topics in his &quot;Quaestiones naturales&quot;. He thought dense air produced propulsion in the form of wind. He explained thunder by saying that it was due to ice colliding in clouds, and in Summer it melted. In the thirteenth century, Aristotelian theories reestablished dominance in meteorology. For the next four centuries, meteorological work by and large was mostly commentary. It has been estimated over 156 commentaries on the &quot;Meteorologica&quot; were written before 1650. 

Experimental evidence was less important than appeal to the classics and authority in medieval thought. In the thirteenth century, Roger Bacon advocated experimentation and the mathematical approach. In his &quot;Opus majus&quot;, he followed Aristotle&#x27;s theory on the atmosphere being composed of water, air, and fire, supplemented by optics and geometric proofs. He noted that Ptolemy&#x27;s climatic zones had to be adjusted for topography. 

St. Albert the Great was the first to propose that each drop of falling rain had the form of a small sphere, and that this form meant that the rainbow was produced by light interacting with each raindrop. Roger Bacon was the first to calculate the angular size of the rainbow. He stated that a rainbow summit cannot appear higher than 42 degrees above the horizon. 

In the late 13th century and early 14th century, Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī and Theodoric of Freiberg were the first to give the correct explanations for the primary rainbow phenomenon. Theoderic went further and also explained the secondary rainbow.

By the middle of the sixteenth century, meteorology had developed along two lines: theoretical science based on &quot;Meteorologica&quot;, and astrological weather forecasting. The pseudoscientific prediction by natural signs became popular and enjoyed protection of the church and princes. This was supported by scientists like Johannes Muller, Leonard Digges, and Johannes Kepler. However, there were skeptics. In the 14th century, Nicole Oresme believed that weather forecasting was possible, but that the rules for it were unknown at the time. Astrological influence in meteorology persisted until the eighteenth century.

Gerolamo Cardano&#x27;s &quot;De Subilitate&quot; (1550) was the first work to challenge fundamental aspects of Aristotelian theory. Cardano maintained that there were only three basic elements- earth, air, and water. He discounted fire because it needed material to spread and produced nothing. Cardano thought there were two kinds of air: free air and enclosed air. The former destroyed inanimate things and preserved animate things, while the latter had the opposite effect.

Rene Descartes&#x27;s Discourse on the Method (1637) typifies the beginning of the scientific revolution in meteorology. His scientific method had four principles: to never accept anything unless one clearly knew it to be true; to divide every difficult problem into small problems to tackle; to proceed from the simple to the complex, always seeking relationships; to be as complete and thorough as possible with no prejudice.

In the appendix &quot;Les Meteores&quot;, he applied these principles to meteorology. He discussed terrestrial bodies and vapors which arise from them, proceeding to explain the formation of clouds from drops of water, and winds, clouds then dissolving into rain, hail and snow. He also discussed the effects of light on the rainbow. Descartes hypothesized that all bodies were composed of small particles of different shapes and interwovenness. All of his theories were based on this hypothesis. He explained the rain as caused by clouds becoming too large for the air to hold, and that clouds became snow if the air was not warm enough to melt them, or hail if they met colder wind. Like his predecessors, Descartes&#x27;s method was deductive, as meteorological instruments were not developed and extensively used yet. He introduced the Cartesian coordinate system to meteorology and stressed the importance of mathematics in natural science. His work established meteorology as a legitimate branch of physics.

In the 18th century, the invention of the thermometer and barometer allowed for more accurate measurements of temperature and pressure, leading to a better understanding of atmospheric processes. This century also saw the birth of the first meteorological society, the Societas Meteorologica Palatina in 1780.

In the 19th century, advances in technology such as the telegraph and photography led to the creation of weather observing networks and the ability to track storms. Additionally, scientists began to use mathematical models to make predictions about the weather. The 20th century saw the development of radar and satellite technology, which greatly improved the ability to observe and track weather systems. In addition, meteorologists and atmospheric scientists started to create the first weather forecasts and temperature predictions.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, with the advent of computer models and big data, meteorology has become increasingly dependent on numerical methods and computer simulations. This has greatly improved weather forecasting and climate predictions. Additionally, meteorology has expanded to include other areas such as air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and climatology. The advancement in observational, theoretical and computational technologies has enabled ever more accurate weather predictions and understanding of weather pattern and air pollution. In current time, with the advancement in weather forecasting and satellite technology, meteorology has become an integral part of everyday life, and is used for many purposes such as aviation, agriculture, and disaster management.

=== Instruments and classification scales ===

In 1441, King Sejong&#x27;s son, Prince Munjong of Korea, invented the first standardized rain gauge. These were sent throughout the Joseon dynasty of Korea as an official tool to assess land taxes based upon a farmer&#x27;s potential harvest. In 1450, Leone Battista Alberti developed a swinging-plate anemometer, and was known as the first &quot;anemometer&quot;. In 1607, Galileo Galilei constructed a thermoscope. In 1611, Johannes Kepler wrote the first scientific treatise on snow crystals: &quot;Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year&#x27;s Gift of Hexagonal Snow).&quot; In 1643, Evangelista Torricelli invented the mercury barometer. In 1662, Sir Christopher Wren invented the mechanical, self-emptying, tipping bucket rain gauge. In 1714, Gabriel Fahrenheit created a reliable scale for measuring temperature with a mercury-type thermometer. In 1742, Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer, proposed the &quot;centigrade&quot; temperature scale, the predecessor of the current Celsius scale. In 1783, the first hair hygrometer was demonstrated by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure. In 1802–1803, Luke Howard wrote &quot;On the Modification of Clouds&quot;, in which he assigns cloud types Latin names. In 1806, Francis Beaufort introduced his system for classifying wind speeds. Near the end of the 19th century the first cloud atlases were published, including the &quot;International Cloud Atlas&quot;, which has remained in print ever since. The April 1960 launch of the first successful weather satellite, TIROS-1, marked the beginning of the age where weather information became available globally.

===Atmospheric composition research===
In 1648, Blaise Pascal rediscovered that atmospheric pressure decreases with height, and deduced that there is a vacuum above the atmosphere. In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli published &quot;Hydrodynamics&quot;, initiating the Kinetic theory of gases and established the basic laws for the theory of gases. In 1761, Joseph Black discovered that ice absorbs heat without changing its temperature when melting. In 1772, Black&#x27;s student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen, which he called &quot;phlogisticated air&quot;, and together they developed the phlogiston theory. In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier discovered oxygen and developed an explanation for combustion. In 1783, in Lavoisier&#x27;s essay &quot;Reflexions sur le phlogistique,&quot; he deprecates the phlogiston theory and proposes a caloric theory. In 1804, John Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of black-body radiation. In 1808, John Dalton defended caloric theory in &quot;A New System of Chemistry&quot; and described how it combines with matter, especially gases; he proposed that the heat capacity of gases varies inversely with atomic weight. In 1824, Sadi Carnot analyzed the efficiency of steam engines using caloric theory; he developed the notion of a reversible process and, in postulating that no such thing exists in nature, laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics. In 1716, Edmund Halley suggested that aurorae are caused by &quot;magnetic effluvia&quot; moving along the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field lines.

===Research into cyclones and air flow===

In 1494, Christopher Columbus experienced a tropical cyclone, which led to the first written European account of a hurricane. In 1686, Edmund Halley presented a systematic study of the trade winds and monsoons and identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions. In 1735, an &quot;ideal&quot; explanation of global circulation through study of the trade winds was written by George Hadley. In 1743, when Benjamin Franklin was prevented from seeing a lunar eclipse by a hurricane, he decided that cyclones move in a contrary manner to the winds at their periphery. Understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the Earth affects airflow was partial at first. Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis published a paper in 1835 on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts, such as waterwheels. In 1856, William Ferrel proposed the existence of a circulation cell in the mid-latitudes, and the air within deflected by the Coriolis force resulting in the prevailing westerly winds. Late in the 19th century, the motion of air masses along isobars was understood to be the result of the large-scale interaction of the pressure gradient force and the deflecting force. By 1912, this deflecting force was named the Coriolis effect. Just after World War I, a group of meteorologists in Norway led by Vilhelm Bjerknes developed the Norwegian cyclone model that explains the generation, intensification and ultimate decay (the life cycle) of mid-latitude cyclones, and introduced the idea of fronts, that is, sharply defined boundaries between air masses. The group included Carl-Gustaf Rossby (who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of fluid dynamics), Tor Bergeron (who first determined how rain forms) and Jacob Bjerknes.

===Observation networks and weather forecasting===

In the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century a range of meteorological instruments were invented – the thermometer, barometer, hydrometer, as well as wind and rain gauges. In the 1650s natural philosophers started using these instruments to systematically record weather observations. Scientific academies established weather diaries and organised observational networks. In 1654, Ferdinando II de Medici established the first &quot;weather observing&quot; network, that consisted of meteorological stations in Florence, Cutigliano, Vallombrosa, Bologna, Parma, Milan, Innsbruck, Osnabrück, Paris and Warsaw. The collected data were sent to Florence at regular time intervals. In the 1660s Robert Hooke of the Royal Society of London sponsored networks of weather observers. Hippocrates&#x27; treatise &quot;Airs, Waters, and Places&quot; had linked weather to disease. Thus early meteorologists attempted to correlate weather patterns with epidemic outbreaks, and the climate with public health.

During the Age of Enlightenment meteorology tried to rationalise traditional weather lore, including astrological meteorology. But there were also attempts to establish a theoretical understanding of weather phenomena. Edmond Halley and George Hadley tried to explain trade winds. They reasoned that the rising mass of heated equator air is replaced by an inflow of cooler air from high latitudes. A flow of warm air at high altitude from equator to poles in turn established an early picture of circulation. Frustration with the lack of discipline among weather observers, and the poor quality of the instruments, led the early modern nation states to organise large observation networks. Thus, by the end of the 18th century, meteorologists had access to large quantities of reliable weather data. In 1832, an electromagnetic telegraph was created by Baron Schilling. The arrival of the electrical telegraph in 1837 afforded, for the first time, a practical method for quickly gathering surface weather observations from a wide area.

This data could be used to produce maps of the state of the atmosphere for a region near the Earth&#x27;s surface and to study how these states evolved through time. To make frequent weather forecasts based on these data required a reliable network of observations, but it was not until 1849 that the Smithsonian Institution began to establish an observation network across the United States under the leadership of Joseph Henry. Similar observation networks were established in Europe at this time. The Reverend William Clement Ley was key in understanding of cirrus clouds and early understandings of Jet Streams. Charles Kenneth Mackinnon Douglas, known as &#x27;CKM&#x27; Douglas read Ley&#x27;s papers after his death and carried on the early study of weather systems.
Nineteenth century researchers in meteorology were drawn from military or medical backgrounds, rather than trained as dedicated scientists. In 1854, the United Kingdom government appointed Robert FitzRoy to the new office of &quot;Meteorological Statist to the Board of Trade&quot; with the task of gathering weather observations at sea. FitzRoy&#x27;s office became the United Kingdom Meteorological Office in 1854, the second oldest national meteorological service in the world (the Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) in Austria was founded in 1851 and is the oldest weather service in the world). The first daily weather forecasts made by FitzRoy&#x27;s Office were published in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in 1860. The following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at principal ports when a gale was expected.

FitzRoy coined the term &quot;weather forecast&quot; and tried to separate scientific approaches from prophetic ones.

Over the next 50 years, many countries established national meteorological services. The India Meteorological Department (1875) was established to follow tropical cyclone and monsoon. The Finnish Meteorological Central Office (1881) was formed from part of Magnetic Observatory of Helsinki University. Japan&#x27;s Tokyo Meteorological Observatory, the forerunner of the Japan Meteorological Agency, began constructing surface weather maps in 1883. The United States Weather Bureau (1890) was established under the United States Department of Agriculture. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (1906) was established by a Meteorology Act to unify existing state meteorological services.

===Numerical weather prediction===

In 1904, Norwegian scientist Vilhelm Bjerknes first argued in his paper &quot;Weather Forecasting as a Problem in Mechanics and Physics&quot; that it should be possible to forecast weather from calculations based upon natural laws.

It was not until later in the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction. In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson published &quot;Weather Prediction By Numerical Process,&quot; after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations that govern atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a numerical calculation scheme that could be devised to allow predictions. Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to complete without electronic computers, and the size of the grid and time steps used in the calculations led to unrealistic results. Though numerical analysis later found that this was due to numerical instability.

Starting in the 1950s, numerical forecasts with computers became feasible. The first weather forecasts derived this way used barotropic (single-vertical-level) models, and could successfully predict the large-scale movement of midlatitude Rossby waves, that is, the pattern of atmospheric lows and highs. In 1959, the UK Meteorological Office received its first computer, a Ferranti Mercury.

In the 1960s, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere was first observed and mathematically described by Edward Lorenz, founding the field of chaos theory. These advances have led to the current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers, to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the Earth (climate models), have been developed that have a resolution today that are as coarse as the older weather prediction models. These climate models are used to investigate long-term climate shifts, such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases.

==Meteorologists==
Meteorologists are scientists who study and work in the field of meteorology. The American Meteorological Society publishes and continually updates an authoritative electronic &quot;Meteorology Glossary&quot;. Meteorologists work in government agencies, private consulting and research services, industrial enterprises, utilities, radio and television stations, and in education. In the United States, meteorologists held about 10,000 jobs in 2018.

Although weather forecasts and warnings are the best known products of meteorologists for the public, weather presenters on radio and television are not necessarily professional meteorologists. They are most often reporters with little formal meteorological training, using unregulated titles such as &quot;weather specialist&quot; or &quot;weatherman&quot;. The American Meteorological Society and National Weather Association issue &quot;Seals of Approval&quot; to weather broadcasters who meet certain requirements but this is not mandatory to be hired by the media.

==Equipment==
Each science has its own unique sets of laboratory equipment. In the atmosphere, there are many things or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured. Rain, which can be observed, or seen anywhere and anytime was one of the first atmospheric qualities measured historically. Also, two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity. Neither of these can be seen but can be felt. The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the rain gauge, the anemometer, and the hygrometer. Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables. Many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable. Even Aristotle noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air.

Sets of surface measurements are important data to meteorologists. They give a snapshot of a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a weather station, a ship or a weather buoy. The measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables. Usually, temperature, pressure, wind measurements, and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer, barometer, anemometer, and hygrometer, respectively. Professional stations may also include air quality sensors (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, dust, and smoke), ceilometer (cloud ceiling), falling precipitation sensor, flood sensor, lightning sensor, microphone (explosions, sonic booms, thunder), pyranometer/pyrheliometer/spectroradiometer (IR/Vis/UV photodiodes), rain gauge/snow gauge, scintillation counter (background radiation, fallout, radon), seismometer (earthquakes and tremors), transmissometer (visibility), and a GPS clock for data logging. Upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting. The most widely used technique is launches of radiosondes. Supplementing the radiosondes a network of aircraft collection is organized by the World Meteorological Organization.

Remote sensing, as used in meteorology, is the concept of collecting data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information. The common types of remote sensing are Radar, Lidar, and satellites (or photogrammetry). Each collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and, usually, stores the data where the instrument is located. Radar and Lidar are not passive because both use EM radiation to illuminate a specific portion of the atmosphere. Weather satellites along with more general-purpose Earth-observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to El Niño.

==Spatial scales==
The study of the atmosphere can be divided into distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales. At one extreme of this scale is climatology. In the timescales of hours to days, meteorology separates into micro-, meso-, and synoptic scale meteorology. Respectively, the geospatial size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale.

Other subclassifications are used to describe the unique, local, or broad effects within those subclasses.
===Microscale===
Microscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena on a scale of about or less. Individual thunderstorms, clouds, and local turbulence caused by buildings and other obstacles (such as individual hills) are modeled on this scale. Misoscale meteorology is an informal subdivision.

===Mesoscale===
Mesoscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from 1 km to 1000 km and a vertical scale that starts at the Earth&#x27;s surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer, troposphere, tropopause, and the lower section of the stratosphere. The terms meso-alpha, meso-beta, and meso-gamma to classify the horizontal scales of atmospheric processes were introduced to the field of mesoscale meteorology by Isidoro Orlanski. Mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to multiple weeks. The events typically of interest are thunderstorms, squall lines, fronts, precipitation bands in tropical and extratropical cyclones, and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and sea and land breezes.

===Synoptic scale===

Synoptic scale meteorology predicts atmospheric changes at scales up to 1000 km and 105 sec (28 days), in time and space. At the synoptic scale, the Coriolis acceleration acting on moving air masses (outside of the tropics) plays a dominant role in predictions. The phenomena typically described by synoptic meteorology include events such as extratropical cyclones, baroclinic troughs and ridges, frontal zones, and to some extent jet streams. All of these are typically given on weather maps for a specific time. The minimum horizontal scale of synoptic phenomena is limited to the spacing between surface observation stations.

===Global scale===
Global scale meteorology is the study of weather patterns related to the transport of heat from the tropics to the poles. Very large scale oscillations are of importance at this scale. These oscillations have time periods typically on the order of months, such as the Madden–Julian oscillation, or years, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Pacific decadal oscillation. Global scale meteorology pushes into the range of climatology. The traditional definition of climate is pushed into larger timescales and with the understanding of the longer time scale global oscillations, their effect on climate and weather disturbances can be included in the synoptic and mesoscale timescales predictions.

Numerical Weather Prediction is a main focus in understanding air–sea interaction, tropical meteorology, atmospheric predictability, and tropospheric/stratospheric processes. The Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California, developed a global atmospheric model called Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS). NOGAPS is run operationally at Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center for the United States Military. Many other global atmospheric models are run by national meteorological agencies.

==Some meteorological principles==

===Boundary layer meteorology===
Boundary layer meteorology is the study of processes in the air layer directly above Earth&#x27;s surface, known as the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The effects of the surface – heating, cooling, and friction – cause turbulent mixing within the air layer. Significant movement of heat, matter, or momentum on time scales of less than a day are caused by turbulent motions. Boundary layer meteorology includes the study of all types of surface–atmosphere boundary, including ocean, lake, urban land and non-urban land for the study of meteorology.

===Dynamic meteorology===
Dynamic meteorology generally focuses on the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere. The idea of &quot;air parcel&quot; is used to define the smallest element of the atmosphere, while ignoring the discrete molecular and chemical nature of the atmosphere. An air parcel is defined as an infinitesimal region in the fluid continuum of the atmosphere. The fundamental laws of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and motion are used to study the atmosphere. The physical quantities that characterize the state of the atmosphere are temperature, density, pressure, etc. These variables have unique values in the continuum.

==Applications==

===Weather forecasting===

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere at a future time and given location. Humans have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since at least the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve.

Once an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, forecast models are now used to determine future conditions. Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the &quot;range&quot; of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.

There are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow, and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.

===Aviation meteorology===
Aviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on air traffic management. It is important for air crews to understand the implications of weather on their flight plan as well as their aircraft, as noted by the &quot;Aeronautical Information Manual&quot;:
The effects of ice on aircraft are cumulative—thrust is reduced, drag increases, lift lessens, and weight increases. The results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance. In extreme cases, 2 to 3 inches of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes. It takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage.

===Agricultural meteorology===
Meteorologists, soil scientists, agricultural hydrologists, and agronomists are people concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution, crop yield, water-use efficiency, phenology of plant and animal development, and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems. Conversely, they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and weather.

===Hydrometeorology===
Hydrometeorology is the branch of meteorology that deals with the hydrologic cycle, the water budget, and the rainfall statistics of storms. A hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating (quantitative) precipitation, heavy rain, heavy snow, and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding. Typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology, mesoscale and synoptic meteorology, and other geosciences.

The multidisciplinary nature of the branch can result in technical challenges, since tools and solutions from each of the individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently, be optimized for different hard- and software platforms and use different data formats. There are some initiatives – such as the DRIHM project – that are trying to address this issue.

===Nuclear meteorology===
Nuclear meteorology investigates the distribution of radioactive aerosols and gases in the atmosphere.

===Maritime meteorology===
Maritime meteorology deals with air and wave forecasts for ships operating at sea. Organizations such as the Ocean Prediction Center, Honolulu National Weather Service forecast office, United Kingdom Met Office, KNMI and JMA prepare high seas forecasts for the world&#x27;s oceans.

===Military meteorology===
Military meteorology is the research and application of meteorology for military purposes. In the United States, the United States Navy&#x27;s Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command oversees meteorological efforts for the Navy and Marine Corps while the United States Air Force&#x27;s Air Force Weather Agency is responsible for the Air Force and Army.

===Environmental meteorology===
Environmental meteorology mainly analyzes industrial pollution dispersion physically and chemically based on meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind, and various weather conditions.

===Renewable energy===
Meteorology applications in renewable energy includes basic research, &quot;exploration,&quot; and potential mapping of wind power and solar radiation for wind and solar energy.

<doc id="19916" wikidata="Q1258" url="?curid=19916" title="Meitnerium">
<text>Meitnerium is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Mt and atomic number 109. It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element (an element not found in nature, but can be created in a laboratory). The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a half-life of 4.5 seconds, although the unconfirmed meitnerium-282 may have a longer half-life of 67 seconds. The element was first synthesized in August 1982 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany, and it was named after Lise Meitner in 1997. 

In the periodic table, meitnerium is a d-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 9 elements, although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to iridium in group 9 as the seventh member of the 6d series of transition metals. Meitnerium is calculated to have properties similar to its lighter homologues, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.

==Introduction==
==History==
===Discovery===
Meitnerium was first synthesized on August 29, 1982, by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt. The team bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of iron-58 and detected a single atom of the isotope meitnerium-266:

This work was confirmed three years later at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna (then in the Soviet Union).

===Naming===

Using Mendeleev&#x27;s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, meitnerium should be known as &quot;eka-iridium&quot;. In 1979, during the Transfermium Wars (but before the synthesis of meitnerium), IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called &quot;unnilennium&quot; (with the corresponding symbol of &quot;Une&quot;), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it &quot;element 109&quot;, with the symbol of &quot;E109&quot;, &quot;(109)&quot; or even simply &quot;109&quot;, or used the proposed name &quot;meitnerium&quot;.

The naming of meitnerium was discussed in the element naming controversy regarding the names of elements 104 to 109, but &quot;meitnerium&quot; was the only proposal and thus was never disputed. The name &quot;meitnerium&quot; (Mt) was suggested by the GSI team in September 1992 in honor of the Austrian physicist Lise Meitner, a co-discoverer of protactinium (with Otto Hahn), and one of the discoverers of nuclear fission. In 1994 the name was recommended by IUPAC, and was officially adopted in 1997. It is thus the only element named specifically after a non-mythological woman (curium being named for both Pierre and Marie Curie).

==Isotopes==
Meitnerium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Eight different isotopes of meitnerium have been reported with mass numbers 266, 268, 270, and 274–278, two of which, meitnerium-268 and meitnerium-270, have unconfirmed metastable states. A ninth isotope with mass number 282 is unconfirmed. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, although some undergo spontaneous fission.

===Stability and half-lives===
All meitnerium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter. The most stable known meitnerium isotope, 278Mt, is also the heaviest known; it has a half-life of 4.5 seconds. The unconfirmed 282Mt is even heavier and appears to have a longer half-life of 67 seconds. With a half-life of 0.8 seconds, the next most stable known isotope is 270Mt. The isotopes 276Mt and 274Mt have half-lives of 0.62 and 0.64 seconds respectively.

The isotope 277Mt, created as the final decay product of 293Ts for the first time in 2012, was observed to undergo spontaneous fission with a half-life of 5 milliseconds. Preliminary data analysis considered the possibility of this fission event instead originating from 277Hs, for it also has a half-life of a few milliseconds, and could be populated following undetected electron capture somewhere along the decay chain. This possibility was later deemed very unlikely based on observed decay energies of 281Ds and 281Rg and the short half-life of 277Mt, although there is still some uncertainty of the assignment. Regardless, the rapid fission of 277Mt and 277Hs is strongly suggestive of a region of instability for superheavy nuclei with &quot;N&quot; = 168–170. The existence of this region, characterized by a decrease in fission barrier height between the deformed shell closure at &quot;N&quot; = 162 and spherical shell closure at &quot;N&quot; = 184, is consistent with theoretical models.

==Predicted properties==
Other than nuclear properties, no properties of meitnerium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that meitnerium and its parents decay very quickly. Properties of meitnerium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.

===Chemical===
Meitnerium is the seventh member of the 6d series of transition metals, and should be much like the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium, thus implying that meitnerium&#x27;s basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.

Prediction of the probable chemical properties of meitnerium has not received much attention recently. Meitnerium is expected to be a noble metal. The standard electrode potential for the Mt3+/Mt couple is expected to be 0.8 V. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium. The oxidation state +9, represented only by iridium in [IrO4]+, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF9) and the [MtO4]+ cation, although [IrO4]+ is expected to be more stable than these meitnerium compounds. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.

===Physical and atomic===
Meitnerium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure, similarly to its lighter congener iridium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 27–28 g/cm3, which would be among the highest of any of the 118 known elements. Meitnerium is also predicted to be paramagnetic.

Theoreticians have predicted the covalent radius of meitnerium to be 6 to 10 pm larger than that of iridium. The atomic radius of meitnerium is expected to be around 128 pm.

==Experimental chemistry==
Meitnerium is the first element on the periodic table whose chemistry has not yet been investigated. Unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of meitnerium has yet to have been established due to the short half-lives of meitnerium isotopes and a limited number of likely volatile compounds that could be studied on a very small scale. One of the few meitnerium compounds that are likely to be sufficiently volatile is meitnerium hexafluoride (), as its lighter homologue iridium hexafluoride () is volatile above 60 °C and therefore the analogous compound of meitnerium might also be sufficiently volatile; a volatile octafluoride () might also be possible. For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1 second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of 278Mt, the most stable confirmed meitnerium isotope, is 4.5 seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of meitnerium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the meitnerium isotopes and have automated systems experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of meitnerium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements; some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and hassium could be reused. However, the experimental chemistry of meitnerium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium.

The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory attempted to synthesize the isotope 271Mt in 2002–2003 for a possible chemical investigation of meitnerium, because it was expected that it might be more stable than nearby isotopes due to having 162 neutrons, a magic number for deformed nuclei; its half-life was predicted to be a few seconds, long enough for a chemical investigation. However, no atoms of 271Mt were detected; this isotope of meitnerium is currently unknown.

An experiment determining the chemical properties of a transactinide would need to compare a compound of that transactinide with analogous compounds of some of its lighter homologues: for example, in the chemical characterization of hassium, hassium tetroxide (HsO4) was compared with the analogous osmium compound, osmium tetroxide (OsO4). In a preliminary step towards determining the chemical properties of meitnerium, the GSI attempted sublimation of the rhodium compounds rhodium(III) oxide (Rh2O3) and rhodium(III) chloride (RhCl3). However, macroscopic amounts of the oxide would not sublimate until 1000 °C and the chloride would not until 780 °C, and then only in the presence of carbon aerosol particles: these temperatures are far too high for such procedures to be used on meitnerium, as most of the current methods used for the investigation of the chemistry of superheavy elements do not work above 500 °C.

Following the 2014 successful synthesis of seaborgium hexacarbonyl, Sg(CO)6, studies were conducted with the stable transition metals of groups 7 through 9, suggesting that carbonyl formation could be extended to further probe the chemistries of the early 6d transition metals from rutherfordium to meitnerium inclusive. Nevertheless, the challenges of low half-lives and difficult production reactions make meitnerium difficult to access for radiochemists, though the isotopes 278Mt and 276Mt are long-lived enough for chemical research and may be produced in the decay chains of 294Ts and 288Mc respectively. 276Mt is likely more suitable, since producing tennessine requires a rare and rather short-lived berkelium target. The isotope 270Mt, observed in the decay chain of 278Nh with a half-life of 0.69 seconds, may also be sufficiently long-lived for chemical investigations, though a direct synthesis route leading to this isotope and more precise measurements of its decay properties would be required.

<doc id="19918" wikidata="Q79735" url="?curid=19918" title="Megabyte">
<text>The megabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. Its recommended unit symbol is MB. The unit prefix &quot;mega&quot; is a multiplier of (106) in the International System of Units (SI). Therefore, one megabyte is one million bytes of information. This definition has been incorporated into the International System of Quantities.

In the computer and information technology fields, other definitions have been used that arose for historical reasons of convenience. A common usage has been to designate one megabyte as (220 B), a quantity that conveniently expresses the binary architecture of digital computer memory. Standards bodies have deprecated this binary usage of the mega- prefix in favor of a new set of binary prefixes, by means of which the quantity 220 B is named mebibyte (symbol MiB).

==Definitions==
The unit megabyte is commonly used for 10002 (one million) bytes or 10242 bytes. The interpretation of using base 1024 originated as technical jargon for the byte multiples that needed to be expressed by the powers of 2 but lacked a convenient name. As 1024 (210) approximates 1000 (103), roughly corresponding to the SI prefix kilo-, it was a convenient term to denote the binary multiple. In 1999, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published standards for binary prefixes requiring the use of &quot;megabyte&quot; to denote 10002 bytes, and &quot;mebibyte&quot; to denote 10242 bytes. By the end of 2009, the IEC Standard had been adopted by the IEEE, EU, ISO and NIST. Nevertheless, the term megabyte continues to be widely used with different meanings.

=== Base 10 ===
: 1 MB = bytes (= 10002 B = 106 B) is the definition following the rules of the International System of Units (SI), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This definition is used in computer networking contexts and most storage media, particularly hard drives, flash-based storage, and DVDs, and is also consistent with the other uses of the SI prefix in computing, such as CPU clock speeds or measures of performance. The Mac OS X 10.6 file manager is a notable example of this usage in software. Since Snow Leopard, file sizes are reported in decimal units.
In this convention, one thousand megabytes (1000 MB) is equal to one gigabyte (1 GB), where 1 GB is one billion bytes.

=== Base 2 ===

: 1 MB = bytes (= 10242 B = 220 B) is the definition used by Microsoft Windows in reference to computer memory, such as random-access memory (RAM). This definition is synonymous with the unambiguous binary unit mebibyte. In this convention, one thousand and twenty-four megabytes (1024 MB) is equal to one gigabyte (1 GB), where 1 GB is 10243 bytes (i.e., 1 GiB).

=== Mixed ===
: 1 MB = bytes (= 1000×1024 B) is the definition used to describe the formatted capacity of the 1.44 MB HD floppy disk, which actually has a capacity of .

Randomly addressable semiconductor memory doubles in size for each address lane added to an integrated circuit package, which favors counts that are powers of two. The capacity of a disk drive is the product of the sector size, number of sectors per track, number of tracks per side, and the number of disk platters in the drive. Changes in any of these factors would not usually double the size.

==Examples of use==

Depending on compression methods and file format, a megabyte of data can roughly be:
* a 1megapixel bitmap image (e.g. ~1152 × 864) with 256 colors (8 bits/pixel color depth) stored without any compression.
* 6seconds of 44.1 kHz/16 bit uncompressed CD audio.
* 1minute of 128kbit/s MP3 lossy compressed audio.
* a typical English book volume in plain text format (500 pages × 2000 characters per page).

The novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, by Oscar Wilde, hosted on Project Gutenberg as an uncompressed plain text file, is 0.429 MB. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is 0.994 MB, and &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is 1.192 MB. 
The human genome consists of DNA representing 800MB of data. The parts that differentiate one person from another can be compressed to 4MB.

<text>Monosaccharides (from Greek &quot;&quot;: single, &quot;&quot;: sugar), also called simple sugars, are the simplest forms of sugar and the most basic units (monomers) from which all carbohydrates are built. Chemically, monosaccharides are polyhydroxy aldehydes with the formula or polyhydroxy ketones with the formula with three or more carbon atoms.

They are usually colorless, water-soluble, and crystalline organic solids. Contrary to their name (sugars), only some monosaccharides have a sweet taste. Most monosaccharides have the formula (CH2O)&quot;x&quot; (though not all molecules with this formula are monosaccharides).

Examples of monosaccharides include glucose (dextrose), fructose (levulose), and galactose. Monosaccharides are the building blocks of disaccharides (such as sucrose, lactose and maltose) and polysaccharides (such as cellulose and starch). The table sugar used in everyday vernacular is itself a disaccharide sucrose comprising one molecule of each of the two monosaccharides -glucose and -fructose.

Each carbon atom that supports a hydroxyl group is chiral, except those at the end of the chain. This gives rise to a number of isomeric forms, all with the same chemical formula. For instance, galactose and glucose are both aldohexoses, but have different physical structures and chemical properties.

The monosaccharide glucose plays a pivotal role in metabolism, where the chemical energy is extracted through glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to provide energy to living organisms. Maltose is the dehydration condensate of two glucose molecules.

== Structure and nomenclature ==

With few exceptions (e.g., deoxyribose), monosaccharides have the chemical formula (CH2O)&quot;x&quot;, where conventionally &quot;x&quot; ≥ 3. Monosaccharides can be classified by the number &quot;x&quot; of carbon atoms they contain: triose (3), tetrose (4), pentose (5), hexose (6), heptose (7), and so on.

Glucose, used as an energy source and for the synthesis of starch, glycogen and cellulose, is a hexose. Ribose and deoxyribose (in RNA and DNA, respectively) are pentose sugars. Examples of heptoses include the ketoses mannoheptulose and sedoheptulose. Monosaccharides with eight or more carbons are rarely observed as they are quite unstable. In aqueous solutions monosaccharides exist as rings if they have more than four carbons.

===Linear-chain monosaccharides===
Simple monosaccharides have a linear and unbranched carbon skeleton with one carbonyl (C=O) functional group, and one hydroxyl (OH) group on each of the remaining carbon atoms. Therefore, the molecular structure of a simple monosaccharide can be written as H(CHOH)&quot;n&quot;(C=O)(CHOH)&quot;m&quot;H, where ; so that its elemental formula is C&quot;x&quot;H2&quot;x&quot;O&quot;x&quot;.

By convention, the carbon atoms are numbered from 1 to &quot;x&quot; along the backbone, starting from the end that is closest to the C=O group. Monosaccharides are the simplest units of carbohydrates and the simplest form of sugar.

If the carbonyl is at position 1 (that is, &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; is zero), the molecule begins with a formyl group H(C=O)− and is technically an aldehyde. In that case, the compound is termed an aldose. Otherwise, the molecule has a ketone group, a carbonyl −(C=O)− between two carbons; then it is formally a ketone, and is termed a ketose. Ketoses of biological interest usually have the carbonyl at position 2.

The various classifications above can be combined, resulting in names such as &quot;aldohexose&quot; and &quot;ketotriose&quot;.

A more general nomenclature for open-chain monosaccharides combines a Greek prefix to indicate the number of carbons (tri-, tetr-, pent-, hex-, etc.) with the suffixes &quot;-ose&quot; for aldoses and &quot;-ulose&quot; for ketoses. In the latter case, if the carbonyl is not at position 2, its position is then indicated by a numeric infix. So, for example, H(C=O)(CHOH)4H is pentose, H(CHOH)(C=O)(CHOH)3H is pentulose, and H(CHOH)2(C=O)(CHOH)2H is pent-3-ulose.

===Open-chain stereoisomers===
Two monosaccharides with equivalent molecular graphs (same chain length and same carbonyl position) may still be distinct stereoisomers, whose molecules differ in spatial orientation. This happens only if the molecule contains a stereogenic center, specifically a carbon atom that is chiral (connected to four distinct molecular sub-structures). Those four bonds can have any of two configurations in space distinguished by their handedness. In a simple open-chain monosaccharide, every carbon is chiral except the first and the last atoms of the chain, and (in ketoses) the carbon with the keto group.

For example, the triketose H(CHOH)(C=O)(CHOH)H (glycerone, dihydroxyacetone) has no stereogenic center, and therefore exists as a single stereoisomer. The other triose, the aldose H(C=O)(CHOH)2H (glyceraldehyde), has one chiral carbon—the central one, number 2—which is bonded to groups −H, −OH, −C(OH)H2, and −(C=O)H. Therefore, it exists as two stereoisomers whose molecules are mirror images of each other (like a left and a right glove). Monosaccharides with four or more carbons may contain multiple chiral carbons, so they typically have more than two stereoisomers. The number of distinct stereoisomers with the same diagram is bounded by 2&quot;c&quot;, where &quot;c&quot; is the total number of chiral carbons.

The Fischer projection is a systematic way of drawing the skeletal formula of an acyclic monosaccharide so that the handedness of each chiral carbon is well specified. Each stereoisomer of a simple open-chain monosaccharide can be identified by the positions (right or left) in the Fischer diagram of the chiral hydroxyls (the hydroxyls attached to the chiral carbons).

Most stereoisomers are themselves chiral (distinct from their mirror images). In the Fischer projection, two mirror-image isomers differ by having the positions of all chiral hydroxyls reversed right-to-left. Mirror-image isomers are chemically identical in non-chiral environments, but usually have very different biochemical properties and occurrences in nature.

While most stereoisomers can be arranged in pairs of mirror-image forms, there are some non-chiral stereoisomers that are identical to their mirror images, in spite of having chiral centers. This happens whenever the molecular graph is symmetrical, as in the 3-ketopentoses H(CHOH)2(CO)(CHOH)2H, and the two halves are mirror images of each other. In that case, mirroring is equivalent to a half-turn rotation. For this reason, there are only three distinct 3-ketopentose stereoisomers, even though the molecule has two chiral carbons.

Distinct stereoisomers that are not mirror-images of each other usually have different chemical properties, even in non-chiral environments. Therefore, each mirror pair and each non-chiral stereoisomer may be given a specific monosaccharide name. For example, there are 16 distinct aldohexose stereoisomers, but the name &quot;glucose&quot; means a specific pair of mirror-image aldohexoses. In the Fischer projection, one of the two glucose isomers has the hydroxyl at left on C3, and at right on C4 and C5; while the other isomer has the reversed pattern. These specific monosaccharide names have conventional three-letter abbreviations, like &quot;Glu&quot; for glucose and &quot;Thr&quot; for threose.

Generally, a monosaccharide with &quot;n&quot; asymmetrical carbons has 2&quot;n&quot; stereoisomers. The number of open chain stereoisomers for an aldose monosaccharide is larger by one than that of a ketose monosaccharide of the same length. Every ketose will have 2(&quot;n&quot;−3) stereoisomers where &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 is the number of carbons. Every aldose will have 2(&quot;n&quot;−2) stereoisomers where &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 is the number of carbons.
These are also referred to as epimers which have the different arrangement of −OH and −H groups at the asymmetric or chiral carbon atoms (this does not apply to those carbons having the carbonyl functional group).

===Configuration of monosaccharides===
Like many chiral molecules, the two stereoisomers of glyceraldehyde will gradually rotate the polarization direction of linearly polarized light as it passes through it, even in solution. The two stereoisomers are identified with the prefixes - and -, according to the sense of rotation: -glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory (rotates the polarization axis clockwise), while -glyceraldehyde is levorotatory (rotates it counterclockwise).
The - and - prefixes are also used with other monosaccharides, to distinguish two particular stereoisomers that are mirror-images of each other. For this purpose, one considers the chiral carbon that is furthest removed from the C=O group. Its four bonds must connect to −H, −OH, −CH2(OH), and the rest of the molecule. If the molecule can be rotated in space so that the directions of those four groups match those of the analog groups in -glyceraldehyde&#x27;s C2, then the isomer receives the - prefix. Otherwise, it receives the - prefix.

In the Fischer projection, the - and - prefixes specifies the configuration at the carbon atom that is second from bottom: - if the hydroxyl is on the right side, and - if it is on the left side.

Note that the - and - prefixes do not indicate the direction of rotation of polarized light, which is a combined effect of the arrangement at all chiral centers. However, the two enantiomers will always rotate the light in opposite directions, by the same amount. See also system.

=== of monosaccharides (hemiacetal formation) ===
A monosaccharide often switches from the acyclic (open-chain) form to a cyclic form, through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxyl groups of the same molecule. The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom. The resulting molecule has a hemiacetal or hemiketal group, depending on whether the linear form was an aldose or a ketose. The reaction is easily reversed, yielding the original open-chain form.

In these cyclic forms, the ring usually has five or six atoms. These forms are called furanoses and pyranoses, respectively—by analogy with furan and pyran, the simplest compounds with the same carbon-oxygen ring (although they lack the double bonds of these two molecules). For example, the aldohexose glucose may form a hemiacetal linkage between the aldehyde group on carbon 1 and the hydroxyl on carbon 4, yielding a molecule with a 5-membered ring, called glucofuranose. The same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a ring, called glucopyranose. Cyclic forms with a seven-atom ring (the same of oxepane), rarely encountered, are called heptoses.

For many monosaccharides (including glucose), the cyclic forms predominate, in the solid state and in solutions, and therefore the same name commonly is used for the open- and closed-chain isomers. Thus, for example, the term &quot;glucose&quot; may signify glucofuranose, glucopyranose, the open-chain form, or a mixture of the three.

Cyclization creates a new stereogenic center at the carbonyl-bearing carbon. The −OH group that replaces the carbonyl&#x27;s oxygen may end up in two distinct positions relative to the ring&#x27;s midplane. Thus each open-chain monosaccharide yields two cyclic isomers (anomers), denoted by the prefixes α- and β-. The molecule can change between these two forms by a process called mutarotation, that consists in a reversal of the ring-forming reaction followed by another ring formation.

====Haworth projection====
The stereochemical structure of a cyclic monosaccharide can be represented in a Haworth projection. In this diagram, the α-isomer for the pyranose form of a -aldohexose has the −OH of the anomeric carbon below the plane of the carbon atoms, while the β-isomer has the −OH of the anomeric carbon above the plane. Pyranoses typically adopt a chair conformation, similar to that of cyclohexane. In this conformation, the α-isomer has the −OH of the anomeric carbon in an axial position, whereas the β-isomer has the −OH of the anomeric carbon in equatorial position (considering -aldohexose sugars).

<text>Microscopium (&quot;the Microscope&quot;) is a minor constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere, one of twelve created in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille and one of several depicting scientific instruments. The name is a Latinised form of the Greek word for microscope. Its stars are faint and hardly visible from most of the non-tropical Northern Hemisphere.

The constellation&#x27;s brightest star is Gamma Microscopii of apparent magnitude 4.68, a yellow giant 2.5 times the Sun&#x27;s mass located 223 ± 8 light-years distant. It passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly disturbing the outer Solar System. Three star systems—WASP-7, AU Microscopii and HD 205739—have been determined to have planets, while other star —the Sun-like star HD 202628— has a debris disk. AU Microscopii and the binary red dwarf system AT Microscopii are probably a wide triple system and members of the Beta Pictoris moving group. Nicknamed &quot;Speedy Mic&quot;, BO Microscopii is a star with an extremely fast rotation period of 9 hours, 7 minutes.

==Characteristics==
Microscopium is a small constellation bordered by Capricornus to the north, Piscis Austrinus and Grus to the east, Sagittarius to the west, and Indus to the south, touching on Telescopium to the southwest. The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Mic&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of four segments (&quot;illustrated in infobox&quot;). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −27.45° and −45.09°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 45°N. Given that its brightest stars are of fifth magnitude, the constellation is invisible to the naked eye in areas with light polluted skies.

==Features==
===Stars===

French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille charted and designated ten stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Iota in 1756. A star in neighbouring Indus that Lacaille had labelled Nu Indi turned out to be in Microscopium, so Gould renamed it Nu Microscopii. Francis Baily considered Gamma and Epsilon Microscopii to belong to the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus, but subsequent cartographers did not follow this. In his 1725 &quot;Catalogus Britannicus&quot;, John Flamsteed labelled the stars 1, 2, 3 and 4 Piscis Austrini, which became Gamma Microscopii, HR 8076, HR 8110 and Epsilon Microscopii respectively. Within the constellation&#x27;s borders, there are 43 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5.

Depicting the eyepiece of the microscope is Gamma Microscopii, which—at magnitude of 4.68—is the brightest star in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 223 ± 8 light years from Earth. It likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, at around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it is possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 400 ± 30 light-years away from Earth, it has swollen to 17.5 times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5 cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. Epsilon Microscopii lies 166 ± 5 light-years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. Theta1 and Theta2 Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation&#x27;s specimen slide.

Many notable objects are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. AX Microscopii, better known as Lacaille 8760, is a red dwarf which lies only 12.9 light-years from the Solar System. At magnitude 6.68, it is the brightest red dwarf in the sky. BO Microscopii is a rapidly rotating star that has 80% the diameter of the Sun. Nicknamed &quot;Speedy Mic&quot;, it has a rotation period of 9 hours 7 minutes. An active star, it has prominent stellar flares that average 100 times stronger than those of the Sun, and are emitting energy mainly in the X-ray and ultraviolet bands of the spectrum. It lies 218 ± 4 light-years away from the Sun. AT Microscopii is a binary star system, both members of which are flare star red dwarfs. The system lies close to and may form a very wide triple system with AU Microscopii, a young star which has a planetary system in the making with a debris disk. The three stars are candidate members of the Beta Pictoris moving group, one of the nearest associations of stars that share a common motion through space.

The Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 2003 reported that observations of four of the Mira variables in Microscopium were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete. Two of them—R and S Microscopii—are challenging stars for novice amateur astronomers, and the other two, U and RY Microscopii, are more difficult still. Another red giant, T Microscopii, is a semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 7.7 and 9.6 over 344 days. Of apparent magnitude 11, DD Microscopii is a symbiotic star system composed of an orange giant of spectral type K2III and white dwarf in close orbit, with the smaller star ionizing the stellar wind of the larger star. The system has a low metallicity. Combined with its high galactic latitude, this indicates that the star system has its origin in the galactic halo of the Milky Way.

HD 205739 is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F7V that is around 1.22 times as massive and 2.3 times as luminous as the Sun. It has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of 280 days that was discovered by the radial velocity method. WASP-7 is a star of spectral type F5V with an apparent magnitude of 9.54, about 1.28 times as massive as the Sun. Its hot Jupiter planet—WASP-7b—was discovered by transit method and found to orbit the star every 4.95 days. HD 202628 is a sunlike star of spectral type G2V with a debris disk that ranges from 158 to 220 AU distant. Its inner edge is sharply defined, indicating a probable planet orbiting between 86 and 158 AU from the star.

===Deep sky objects===

Describing Microscopium as &quot;totally unremarkable&quot;, astronomer Patrick Moore concluded there was nothing of interest for amateur observers. NGC 6925 is a barred spiral galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.3 which is lens-shaped, as it lies almost edge-on to observers on Earth, 3.7 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Microscopii. SN 2011ei, a Type II Supernova in NGC 6925, was discovered by Stu Parker in New Zealand in July 2011. NGC 6923 lies nearby and is a magnitude fainter still. The Microscopium Void is a roughly rectangular region of relatively empty space, bounded by incomplete sheets of galaxies from other voids. The Microscopium Supercluster is an overdensity of galaxy clusters that was first noticed in the early 1990s. The component Abell clusters 3695 and 3696 are likely to be gravitationally bound, while the relations of Abell clusters 3693 and 3705 in the same field are unclear.

===Meteor showers===

The Microscopids are a minor meteor shower that appear from June to mid-July.

==History==
Microscopium lies in a region where Ptolemy had listed six &#x27;unformed&#x27; stars behind the tail of Piscis Austrinus. Al-Sufi did not include these stars in his revision of the &quot;Almagest&quot;, presumably because he could not identify them. Microscopium was introduced in 1751–52 by Lacaille with the French name &quot;le Microscope&quot;, after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Commemorating the compound microscope, the Microscope&#x27;s name had been Latinised by Lacaille to &quot;Microscopium&quot; by 1763.

<doc id="19925" wikidata="Q843331" url="?curid=19925" title="IC 342/Maffei Group">
<text>The IC 342/Maffei Group (also known as the IC 342 Group or the Maffei 1 Group) corresponds to one or two galaxy groups close to the Local Group. The member galaxies are mostly concentrated around either IC 342 or Maffei 1, which would be the brightest two galaxies in the group. The group is part of the Virgo Supercluster. However, recent studies have found that the two subgroups are unrelated; while the IC 342 group is the nearest galaxy group to the Milky Way, the Maffei 1 group is several times farther away, and is not gravitationally bound to the IC 342 group.

==Members==

The table below lists galaxies that have been identified as associated with the IC342/Maffei 1 Group by I. D. Karachentsev. Note that Karachentsev divides this group into two subgroups centered around IC 342 and Maffei 1.


Additionally, KKH 37 is listed as possibly being a member of the IC 342 Subgroup, and KKH 6 is listed as possibly being a member of the Maffei 1 Subgroup.

==Foreground dust obscuration==

As seen from Earth, the group lies near the plane of the Milky Way (a region sometimes called the Zone of Avoidance). Consequently, the light from many of the galaxies is severely affected by dust obscuration within the Milky Way. This complicates observational studies of the group, as uncertainties in the dust obscuration also affect measurements of the galaxies&#x27; luminosities and distances as well as other related quantities.

Moreover, the galaxies within the group have historically been difficult to identify. Many galaxies have only been discovered using late 20th century astronomical instrumentation. For example, Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 were only discovered in 1968 using infrared photographic images of the region. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine whether some objects near IC 342 or Maffei 1 are galaxies associated with the IC 342/Maffei Group or diffuse foreground objects within the Milky Way that merely look like galaxies. For example, the objects MB 2 and Camelopardalis C were once thought to be dwarf galaxies in the IC 342/Maffei Group but are now known to be objects within the Milky Way.

==Group formation and possible interactions with the Local Group==

Since the IC 342/Maffei Group and the Local Group are located physically close to each other, the two groups may have influenced each other&#x27;s evolution during the early stages of galaxy formation. An analysis of the velocities and distances to the IC 342/Maffei Group as measured by M. J. Valtonen and collaborators suggested that IC 342 and Maffei 1 were moving faster than what could be accounted for in the expansion of the universe. They therefore suggested that IC 342 and Maffei 1 were ejected from the Local Group after a violent gravitational interaction with the Andromeda Galaxy during the early stages of the formation of the two groups.

However, this interpretation is dependent on the distances measured to the galaxies in the group, which in turn is dependent on accurately measuring the degree to which interstellar dust in the Milky Way obscures the group. More recent observations have demonstrated that the dust obscuration may have been previously overestimated, so the distances may have been underestimated. If these new distance measurements are correct, then the galaxies in the IC 342/Maffei Group appear to be moving at the rate expected from the expansion of the universe, and the scenario of a collision between the IC 342/Maffei Group and the Local Group would be implausible.

<text>The M81 Group is a galaxy group in the constellations Ursa Major and Camelopardalis that includes the galaxies Messier 81 and Messier 82, as well as several other galaxies with high apparent brightnesses. The approximate center of the group is located at a distance of 3.6 Mpc, making it one of the nearest groups to the Local Group. The group is estimated to have a total mass of (1.03 ± 0.17).
The M81 Group, the Local Group, and other nearby groups all lie within the Virgo Supercluster (i.e. the Local Supercluster).

==Members==

The table below lists galaxies that have been identified as associated with the M81 Group by I. D. Karachentsev.

Note that the object names used in the above table differ from the names used by Karachentsev. NGC, IC, UGC, and PGC numbers have been used in many cases to allow for easier referencing.

==Interactions within the group==

Messier 81, Messier 82, and NGC 3077 are all strongly interacting with each other. Observations of the 21-centimeter hydrogen line indicate how the galaxies are connected. 
The gravitational interactions have stripped some hydrogen gas away from all three galaxies, leading to the formation of filamentary gas structures within the group. Bridges of neutral hydrogen have been shown to connect M81 with M82 and NGC 3077. Moreover, the interactions have also caused some interstellar gas to fall into the centers of Messier 82 and NGC 3077, which has led to strong starburst activity (or the formation of many stars) within the centers of these two galaxies. Computer simulations of tidal interactions have been used to show how the current structure of the group could have been created.

<text>In poetry, metre (Commonwealth spelling) or meter (American spelling; see spelling differences) is the basic rhythmic structure of a verse or lines in verse. Many traditional verse forms prescribe a specific verse metre, or a certain set of metres alternating in a particular order. The study and the actual use of metres and forms of versification are both known as prosody. (Within linguistics, &quot;prosody&quot; is used in a more general sense that includes not only poetic metre but also the rhythmic aspects of prose, whether formal or informal, that vary from language to language, and sometimes between poetic traditions.)

==Characteristics==
An assortment of features can be identified when classifying poetry and its metre.

===Qualitative versus quantitative metre===
The metre of most poetry of the Western world and elsewhere is based on patterns of syllables of particular types. The familiar type of metre in English-language poetry is called qualitative metre, with stressed syllables coming at regular intervals (e.g. in iambic pentameters, usually every even-numbered syllable). Many Romance languages use a scheme that is somewhat similar but where the position of only one particular stressed syllable (e.g. the last) needs to be fixed. The alliterative metre of the old Germanic poetry of languages such as Old Norse and Old English was radically different, but was still based on stress patterns.

Some classical languages, in contrast, used a different scheme known as quantitative metre, where patterns were based on syllable weight rather than stress. In the dactylic hexameters of Classical Latin and Classical Greek, for example, each of the six feet making up the line was either a dactyl (long-short-short) or a spondee (long-long): a &quot;long syllable&quot; was literally one that took longer to pronounce than a short syllable: specifically, a syllable consisting of a long vowel or diphthong or followed by two consonants. The stress pattern of the words made no difference to the metre. A number of other ancient languages also used quantitative metre, such as Sanskrit, Persian, Old Church Slavonic and Classical Arabic (but not Biblical Hebrew).

Finally, non-stressed languages that have little or no differentiation of syllable length, such as French or Chinese, base their verses on the number of syllables only. The most common form in French is the , with twelve syllables a verse, and in classical Chinese five characters, and thus five syllables. But since each Chinese character is pronounced using one syllable in a certain tone, classical Chinese poetry also had more strictly defined rules, such as thematic parallelism or tonal antithesis between lines.

===Feet===

In many Western classical poetic traditions, the metre of a verse can be described as a sequence of &quot;feet&quot;, each foot being a specific sequence of syllable types – such as relatively unstressed/stressed (the norm for English poetry) or long/short (as in most classical Latin and Greek poetry).

Iambic pentameter, a common metre in English poetry, is based on a sequence of five &quot;iambic feet&quot; or &quot;iambs&quot;, each consisting of a relatively unstressed syllable (here represented with &quot;˘&quot; above the syllable) followed by a relatively stressed one (here represented with &quot;/&quot; above the syllable) – 

This approach to analyzing and classifying metres originates from Ancient Greek tragedians and poets such as Homer, Pindar, Hesiod, and Sappho.

However some metres have an overall rhythmic pattern to the line that cannot easily be described using feet. This occurs in Sanskrit poetry; see Vedic metre and Sanskrit metre. It also occurs in some Western metres, such as the hendecasyllable favoured by Catullus and Martial, which can be described as:

x x — ∪ ∪ — ∪ — ∪ — —

(where &quot;—&quot; = long, &quot;∪&quot; = short, and &quot;x x&quot; can be realized as &quot;— ∪&quot; or &quot;— —&quot; or &quot;∪ —&quot;)

If the line has only one foot, it is called a &quot;monometer&quot;; two feet, &quot;dimeter&quot;; three is &quot;trimeter&quot;; four is &quot;tetrameter&quot;; five is &quot;pentameter&quot;; six is &quot;hexameter&quot;, seven is &quot;heptameter&quot; and eight is &quot;octameter&quot;. For example, if the feet are iambs, and if there are five feet to a line, then it is called an iambic pentameter. If the feet are primarily &quot;dactyls&quot; and there are six to a line, then it is a dactylic hexameter.

In classical Greek and Latin, however, the name &quot;iambic trimeter&quot; refers to a line with six iambic feet.

===Caesura===
Sometimes a natural pause occurs in the middle of a line rather than at a line-break. This is a caesura (cut). A good example is from &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; by William Shakespeare; the caesurae are indicated by &#x27;/&#x27;:
:It is for you we speak, / not for ourselves:
:You are abused / and by some putter-on
:That will be damn&#x27;d for&#x27;t; / would I knew the villain,
:I would land-damn him. / Be she honour-flaw&#x27;d,
:I have three daughters; / the eldest is eleven
In Latin and Greek poetry, a caesura is a break within a foot caused by the end of a word.

Each line of traditional Germanic alliterative verse is divided into two half-lines by a caesura. This can be seen in Piers Plowman:
:A fair feeld ful of folk / fond I ther bitwene—
:Of alle manere of men / the meene and the riche,
:Werchynge and wandrynge / as the world asketh.
:Somme putten hem to the plough / pleiden ful selde,
:In settynge and sowynge / swonken ful harde,
:And wonnen that thise wastours / with glotonye destruyeth.
===Enjambment===

By contrast with caesura, enjambment is incomplete syntax at the end of a line; the meaning runs over from one poetic line to the next, without terminal punctuation. Also from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;:
:I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
:Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
:Perchance shall dry your pities; but I have
:That honourable grief lodged here which burns
:Worse than tears drown.
===Metric variations===
Poems with a well-defined overall metric pattern often have a few lines that violate that pattern. A common variation is the &quot;inversion&quot; of a foot, which turns an iamb (&quot;da-DUM&quot;) into a trochee (&quot;DUM-da&quot;). A second variation is a &quot;headless&quot; verse, which lacks the first syllable of the first foot. A third variation is catalexis, where the end of a line is shortened by a foot, or two or part thereof – an example of this is at the end of each verse in Keats&#x27; &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot;:

:And on thy cheeks a fading rose (4 feet)
:Fast withereth too (2 feet)
==Modern English==
Most English metre is classified according to the same system as Classical metre with an important difference. English is an accentual language, and therefore beats and offbeats (stressed and unstressed syllables) take the place of the long and short syllables of classical systems. In most English verse, the metre can be considered as a sort of back beat, against which natural speech rhythms vary expressively. The most common characteristic feet of English verse are the iamb in two syllables and the anapest in three. (See Metrical foot for a complete list of the metrical feet and their names.)

===Metrical systems===
The number of metrical systems in English is not agreed upon. The four major types are: accentual verse, accentual-syllabic verse, syllabic verse and quantitative verse. The alliterative verse found in Old English, Middle English, and some modern English poems can be added to this list, as it operates on somewhat different principles than accentual verse. Alliterative verse pairs two phrases (half-lines) joined by alliteration; while there are usually two stresses per half-line, variations in the number of stresses do occur. Accentual verse focuses on the number of stresses in a line, while ignoring the number of offbeats and syllables; accentual-syllabic verse focuses on regulating both the number of stresses and the total number of syllables in a line; syllabic verse only counts the number of syllables in a line; quantitative verse regulates the patterns of long and short syllables (this sort of verse is often considered alien to English). The use of foreign metres in English is all but exceptional.

===Frequently used metres===
The most frequently encountered metre of English verse is the iambic pentameter, in which the metrical norm is five iambic feet per line, though metrical substitution is common and rhythmic variations are practically inexhaustible. John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, most sonnets, and much else besides in English are written in iambic pentameter. Lines of unrhymed iambic pentameter are commonly known as blank verse. Blank verse in the English language is most famously represented in the plays of William Shakespeare and the great works of Milton, though Tennyson (&quot;Ulysses&quot;, &quot;The Princess&quot;) and Wordsworth (&quot;The Prelude&quot;) also make notable use of it.

A rhymed pair of lines of iambic pentameter make a heroic couplet, a verse form which was used so often in the 18th century that it is now used mostly for humorous effect (although see &quot;Pale Fire&quot; for a non-trivial case). The most famous writers of heroic couplets are Dryden and Pope.

Another important metre in English is the common metre, also called the &quot;ballad metre&quot;, which is a four-line stanza, with two pairs of a line of iambic tetrameter followed by a line of iambic trimeter; the rhymes usually fall on the lines of trimeter, although in many instances the tetrameter also rhymes. This is the metre of most of the Border and Scots or English ballads. In hymnody it is called the &quot;common metre&quot;, as it is the most common of the named hymn metres used to pair many hymn lyrics with melodies, such as &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;:

:Amazing Grace! how sweet the sound
::That saved a wretch like me;
:I once was lost, but now am found;
::Was blind, but now I see.

Emily Dickinson is famous for her frequent use of ballad metre:

:Great streets of silence led away
:To neighborhoods of pause —
:Here was no notice — no dissent —
:No universe — no laws.
==Other languages==
===Sanskrit===

Versification in Classical Sanskrit poetry is of three kinds.

#Syllabic () metres depend on the number of syllables in a verse, with relative freedom in the distribution of light and heavy syllables. This style is derived from older Vedic forms. An example is the Anuṣṭubh metre found in the great epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, which has exactly eight syllables in each line, of which only some are specified as to length.
#Syllabo-quantitative () metres depend on syllable count, but the light-heavy patterns are fixed. An example is the Mandākrāntā metre, in which each line has 17 syllables in a fixed pattern.
#Quantitative () metres depend on duration, where each line has a fixed number of &quot;morae&quot;, grouped in feet with usually 4 &quot;morae&quot; in each foot. An example is the Arya metre, in which each verse has four lines of 12, 18, 12, and 15 &quot;morae&quot; respectively. In each 4-&quot;mora&quot; foot there can be two long syllables, four short syllables, or one long and two short in any order.

Standard traditional works on metre are Pingala&#x27;s and Kedāra&#x27;s . The most exhaustive compilations, such as the modern ones by Patwardhan and Velankar contain over 600 metres. This is a substantially larger repertoire than in any other metrical tradition.

===Greek and Latin===
The metrical &quot;feet&quot; in the classical languages were based on the length of time taken to pronounce each syllable, which were categorized according to their weight as either &quot;long&quot; syllables or &quot;short&quot; syllables (indicated as &quot;dum&quot; and &quot;di&quot; below). These are also called &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;light&quot; syllables, respectively, to distinguish from long and short vowels. The foot is often compared to a musical measure and the long and short syllables to whole notes and half notes. In English poetry, feet are determined by emphasis rather than length, with stressed and unstressed syllables serving the same function as long and short syllables in classical metre.

The basic unit in Greek and Latin prosody is a mora, which is defined as a single short syllable. A long syllable is equivalent to two morae. A long syllable contains either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a short vowel followed by two or more consonants. Various rules of elision sometimes prevent a grammatical syllable from making a full syllable, and certain other lengthening and shortening rules (such as correption) can create long or short syllables in contexts where one would expect the opposite.

The most important Classical metre is the dactylic hexameter, the metre of Homer and Virgil. This form uses verses of six feet. The word &quot;dactyl&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;daktylos&quot; meaning &quot;finger&quot;, since there is one long part followed by two short stretches. The first four feet are dactyls (&quot;daa-duh-duh&quot;), but can be spondees (&quot;daa-daa&quot;). The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl. The sixth foot is either a spondee or a trochee (&quot;daa-duh&quot;). The initial syllable of either foot is called the &quot;ictus&quot;, the basic &quot;beat&quot; of the verse. There is usually a caesura after the ictus of the third foot. The opening line of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; is a typical line of dactylic hexameter:

:Armă vĭ | rumquĕ că | nō, Troi | ae quī | prīmŭs ăb | ōrīs
:(&quot;I sing of arms and the man, who first from the shores of Troy...&quot;)

In this example, the first and second feet are dactyls; their first syllables, &quot;Ar&quot; and &quot;rum&quot; respectively, contain short vowels, but count as long because the vowels are both followed by two consonants. The third and fourth feet are spondees, the first of which is divided by the main caesura of the verse. The fifth foot is a dactyl, as is nearly always the case. The final foot is a spondee.

The dactylic hexameter was imitated in English by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his poem &quot;Evangeline&quot;:
:This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,
:Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,
:Stand like Druids of old, with voices sad and prophetic,
:Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.
Notice how the first line:
:&quot;This&quot; is the | &quot;for&quot;-est pri | &quot;me&quot;-val. The | &quot;mur&quot;-muring | &quot;pines&quot; and the | &quot;hem-locks&quot;

Follows this pattern:
:dum diddy | dum diddy | dum diddy | dum diddy | dum diddy | dum dum

Also important in Greek and Latin poetry is the dactylic pentameter. This was a line of verse, made up of two equal parts, each of which contains two dactyls followed by a long syllable, which counts as a half foot. In this way, the number of feet amounts to five in total. Spondees can take the place of the dactyls in the first half, but never in the second. The long syllable at the close of the first half of the verse always ends a word, giving rise to a caesura.

Dactylic pentameter is never used in isolation. Rather, a line of dactylic pentameter follows a line of dactylic hexameter in the elegiac distich or elegiac couplet, a form of verse that was used for the composition of elegies and other tragic and solemn verse in the Greek and Latin world, as well as love poetry that was sometimes light and cheerful. An example from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Tristia&quot;:

:Vergĭlĭ | um vī | dī tan | tum, nĕc ă | māră Tĭ | bullō
::Tempŭs ă | mīcĭtĭ | ae || fātă dĕ | dērĕ mĕ | ae.

:(&quot;Virgil I merely saw, and the harsh Fates gave Tibullus no time for my friendship.&quot;)

The Greeks and Romans also used a number of lyric metres, which were typically used for shorter poems than elegiacs or hexameter. In Aeolic verse, one important line was called the hendecasyllabic, a line of eleven syllables. This metre was used most often in the Sapphic stanza, named after the Greek poet Sappho, who wrote many of her poems in the form. A hendecasyllabic is a line with a never-varying structure: two trochees, followed by a dactyl, then two more trochees. In the Sapphic stanza, three hendecasyllabics are followed by an &quot;Adonic&quot; line, made up of a dactyl and a trochee. This is the form of Catullus 51 (itself an homage to Sappho 31):

:Illĕ mī pār essĕ dĕō vĭdētur;
:illĕ, sī fās est, sŭpĕrārĕ dīvōs,
:quī sĕdēns adversŭs ĭdentĭdem tē
::spectăt ĕt audit

:(&quot;He seems to me to be like a god; if it is permitted, he seems above the gods, who sitting across from you gazes at you and hears you again and again.&quot;)

The Sapphic stanza was imitated in English by Algernon Charles Swinburne in a poem he simply called &quot;Sapphics&quot;:

:Saw the white implacable Aphrodite,
:Saw the hair unbound and the feet unsandalled
:Shine as fire of sunset on western waters;
::Saw the reluctant...


===Classical Arabic===
The metrical system of Classical Arabic poetry, like those of classical Greek and Latin, is based on the weight of syllables classified as either &quot;long&quot; or &quot;short&quot;. The basic principles of Arabic poetic metre are called &quot;ʿarūḍ&quot; () or &quot;ʿilm al-shiʿr&quot; (), meaning “science of poetry.” It was put forth by Al-Farahidi (718 - 786 CE), who did so after noticing that poems consisted of repeated syllables in each verse. In his first book, &quot;al-Arḍ&quot; (), he described 15 types of verse. Al-Akhfash described one extra, the 16th.

A short syllable contains a short vowel with no following consonants. For example, the word &quot;kataba,&quot; which syllabifies as &quot;ka-ta-ba&quot;, contains three short vowels and is made up of three short syllables. A long syllable contains either a long vowel or a short vowel followed by a consonant as is the case in the word &quot;maktūbun&quot; which syllabifies as &quot;mak-tū-bun&quot;. These are the only syllable types possible in Classical Arabic phonology which, by and large, does not allow a syllable to end in more than one consonant or a consonant to occur in the same syllable after a long vowel. In other words, syllables of the type &quot;-āk-&quot; or &quot;-akr-&quot; are not found in classical Arabic.

Each verse consists of a certain number of metrical feet (&quot;tafāʿīl&quot; or &quot;ʾaǧzāʾ&quot;) and a certain combination of possible feet constitutes a metre (&quot;baḥr&quot;).

The traditional Arabic practice for writing out a poem&#x27;s metre is to use a concatenation of various derivations of the verbal root &quot;F-ʿ-L&quot; (فعل). Thus, the following hemistich

قفا نبك من ذكرى حبيبٍ ومنزلِ

Would be traditionally scanned as:

فعولن مفاعيلن فعولن مفاعلن

That is, Romanized and with traditional Western scansion:

 Western: ⏑ – – ⏑ – – – ⏑ – – ⏑ – ⏑ –
 Verse: &quot;Qifā nabki min ḏikrā ḥabībin wa-manzili&quot;
 Mnemonic: fa`ūlun mafā`īlun fa`ūlun mafā`ilun

Al-Khalīl b. Aḥmad al-Farāhīdī&#x27;s contribution to the study of Arabic prosody is undeniably significant: he was the first scholar to subject Arabic poetry to a meticulous, painstaking metrical analysis. Unfortunately, he fell short of producing a coherent theory; instead, he was content to merely gather, classify, and categorize the primary data—a first step which, though insufficient, represents no mean accomplishment. Therefore, al-Khalīl has left a formulation of utmost complexity and difficulty which requires immense effort to master; even the accomplished scholar cannot utilize and apply it with ease and total confidence. Dr. Ibrāhīm Anīs, one of the most distinguished and celebrated pillars of Arabic literature and the Arabic language in the 20th century, states the issue clearly in his book &quot;Mūsīqā al-Shiʿr&quot;:

“I am aware of no [other] branch of Arabic studies which embodies as many [technical] terms as does [al-Khalīl’s] prosody, few and distinct as the meters are: al-Khalīl’s disciples employed a large number of infrequent items, assigning to those items certain technical denotations which—invariably—require definition and explanation. … As to the rules of metric variation, they are numerous to the extent that they defy memory and impose a taxing course of study. … In learning them, a student faces severe hardship which obscures all connection with an artistic genre—indeed, the most artistic of all—namely, poetry. … It is in this fashion that [various] authors dealt with the subject under discussion over a period of eleven centuries: none of them attempted to introduce a new approach or to simplify the rules. … Is it not time for a new, simple presentation which avoids contrivance, displays close affinity to [the art of] poetry, and perhaps renders the science of prosody palatable as well as manageable?”

In the 20th and the 21st centuries, numerous scholars have endeavored to supplement al-Khalīl&#x27;s contribution.

====The Arabic metres====

Classical Arabic has sixteen established metres. Though each of them allows for a certain amount of variation, their basic patterns are as follows, using:
* &quot;–&quot; for 1 long syllable
* &quot;⏑&quot; for 1 short syllable
* &quot;x&quot; for a position that can contain 1 long or 1 short
* &quot;o&quot; for a position that can contain 1 long or 2 shorts
* &quot;S&quot; for a position that can contain 1 long, 2 shorts, or 1 long + 1 short

===Classical Persian===

The terminology for metrical system used in classical and classical-style Persian poetry is the same as that of Classical Arabic, even though these are quite different in both origin and structure. This has led to serious confusion among prosodists, both ancient and modern, as to the true source and nature of the Persian metres, the most obvious error being the assumption that they were copied from Arabic.

Persian poetry is quantitative, and the metrical patterns are made of long and short syllables, much as in Classical Greek, Latin and Arabic. &quot;Anceps&quot; positions in the line, however, that is places where either a long or short syllable can be used (marked &quot;x&quot; in the schemes below), are not found in Persian verse except in some metres at the beginning of a line.

Persian poetry is written in couplets, with each half-line (hemistich) being 10-14 syllables long. Except in the ruba&#x27;i (quatrain), where either of two very similar metres may be used, the same metre is used for every line in the poem. Rhyme is always used, sometimes with double rhyme or internal rhymes in addition. In some poems, known as masnavi, the two halves of each couplet rhyme, with a scheme AA BB CC. In lyric poetry, the same rhyme is used throughout the poem at the end of each couplet, but except in the opening couplet, the two halves of each couplet do not rhyme; hence the scheme is AA BA CA DA. A &quot;ruba&#x27;i&quot; (quatrain) also usually has the rhyme AA BA.

A particular feature of classical Persian prosody, not found in Latin, Greek or Arabic, is that instead of two lengths of syllables (long and short), there are three lengths (short, long, and overlong). Overlong syllables can be used anywhere in the line in place of a long + a short, or in the final position in a line or half line. When a metre has a pair of short syllables (⏑ ⏑), it is common for a long syllable to be substituted, especially at the end of a line or half-line.

About 30 different metres are commonly used in Persian. 70% of lyric poems are written in one of the following seven metres:
*– – ⏑ – ⏑ – ⏑ ⏑ – – ⏑ – ⏑ –
*x ⏑ – – ⏑ ⏑ – – ⏑ ⏑ – – ⏑ ⏑ –
*x ⏑ – – ⏑ – ⏑ – ⏑ ⏑ –
*– – ⏑ ⏑ – – ⏑ ⏑ – – ⏑ ⏑ – –

&quot;Masnavi&quot; poems (that is, long poems in rhyming couplets) are always written in one of the shorter 11 or 10-syllable metres (traditionally seven in number) such as the following:
*⏑ – – ⏑ – – ⏑ – – ⏑ – (e.g. Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shahnameh)
*⏑ – – – ⏑ – – – ⏑ – – (e.g. Gorgani&#x27;s Vis o Ramin)
*– ⏑ – – – ⏑ – – – ⏑ – (e.g. Rumi&#x27;s Masnavi-e Ma&#x27;navi)
*– – ⏑ ⏑ – ⏑ – ⏑ – – (e.g. Nezami&#x27;s Leyli o Majnun)

The two metres used for &quot;ruba&#x27;iyat&quot; (quatrains), which are only used for this, are the following, of which the second is a variant of the first:
*– – ⏑ ⏑ – ⏑ – ⏑ – – ⏑ ⏑ –

===Classical Chinese===

Classical Chinese poetic metric may be divided into fixed and variable length line types, although the actual scansion of the metre is complicated by various factors, including linguistic changes and variations encountered in dealing with a tradition extending over a geographically extensive regional area for a continuous time period of over some two-and-a-half millennia. Beginning with the earlier recorded forms: the Classic of Poetry tends toward couplets of four-character lines, grouped in rhymed quatrains; and, the Chuci follows this to some extent, but moves toward variations in line length. Han Dynasty poetry tended towards the variable line-length forms of the folk ballads and the Music Bureau yuefu. Jian&#x27;an poetry, Six Dynasties poetry, and Tang Dynasty poetry tend towards a poetic metre based on fixed-length lines of five, seven, (or, more rarely six) characters/verbal units tended to predominate, generally in couplet/quatrain-based forms, of various total verse lengths. The Song poetry is specially known for its use of the &quot;ci&quot;, using variable line lengths which follow the specific pattern of a certain musical song&#x27;s lyrics, thus &quot;ci&quot; are sometimes referred to as &quot;fixed-rhythm&quot; forms. Yuan poetry metres continued this practice with their &quot;qu&quot; forms, similarly fixed-rhythm forms based on now obscure or perhaps completely lost original examples (or, ur-types). Not that Classical Chinese poetry ever lost the use of the &quot;shi&quot; forms, with their metrical patterns found in the &quot;old style poetry&quot; (&quot;gushi&quot;) and the regulated verse forms of (&quot;lüshi&quot; or &quot;jintishi&quot;). The regulated verse forms also prescribed patterns based upon linguistic tonality. The use of caesura is important in regard to the metrical analysis of Classical Chinese poetry forms.

===Old English===
The metric system of Old English poetry was different from that of modern English, and related more to the verse forms of most of the older Germanic languages such as Old Norse. It used alliterative verse, a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number (usually four) of strong stresses in each line. The unstressed syllables were relatively unimportant, but the caesurae (breaks between the half-lines) played a major role in Old English poetry.

In place of using feet, alliterative verse divided each line into two half-lines. Each half-line had to follow one of five or so patterns, each of which defined a sequence of stressed and unstressed syllables, typically with two stressed syllables per half line. Unlike typical Western poetry, however, the number of unstressed syllables could vary somewhat. For example, the common pattern &quot;DUM-da-DUM-da&quot; could allow between one and five unstressed syllables between the two stresses.

The following is a famous example, taken from The Battle of Maldon, a poem written shortly after the date of that battle (AD 991):

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
&quot;Hige sceal þe heardra,&quot; || &quot;heorte þe cēnre,&quot;
&quot;mōd sceal þe māre,&quot; || &quot;swā ūre mægen lȳtlað&quot;

(&quot;Will must be the harder, courage the bolder,
spirit must be the more, as our might lessens.&quot;)
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the quoted section, the stressed syllables have been underlined. (Normally, the stressed syllable must be long if followed by another syllable in a word. However, by a rule known as &quot;syllable resolution&quot;, two short syllables in a single word are considered equal to a single long syllable. Hence, sometimes two syllables have been underlined, as in &quot;hige&quot; and &quot;mægen&quot;.) The German philologist Eduard Sievers (died 1932) identified five different patterns of half-line in Anglo-Saxon alliterative poetry. The first three half-lines have the type A pattern &quot;DUM-da-(da-)DUM-da&quot;, while the last one has the type C pattern &quot;da-(da-da-)DUM-DUM-da&quot;, with parentheses indicating optional unstressed syllables that have been inserted. Note also the pervasive pattern of alliteration, where the first and/or second stressed syllables alliterate with the third, but not with the fourth.

===French===
In French poetry, metre is determined solely by the number of syllables in a line. A silent &#x27;e&#x27; counts as a syllable before a consonant, but is elided before a vowel (where &quot;h aspiré&quot; counts as a consonant). At the end of a line, the &quot;e&quot; remains unelided but is hypermetrical (outside the count of syllables, like a feminine ending in English verse), in that case, the rhyme is also called &quot;feminine&quot;, whereas it is called &quot;masculine&quot; in the other cases.

The most frequently encountered metre in Classical French poetry is the alexandrine, composed of two hemistiches of six syllables each. Two famous alexandrines are

:&quot;La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaë&quot;
::(Jean Racine)

(the daughter of Minos and of Pasiphaë), and
:&quot;Waterloo ! Waterloo ! Waterloo ! Morne plaine!&quot;
::(Victor Hugo)

(Waterloo! Waterloo! Waterloo! Gloomy plain!)

Classical French poetry also had a complex set of rules for rhymes that goes beyond how words merely sound. These are usually taken into account when describing the metre of a poem.

===Spanish===
In Spanish poetry the metre is determined by the number of syllables the verse has. Still it is the phonetic accent in the last word of the verse that decides the final count of the line. If the accent of the final word is at the last syllable, then the poetic rule states that one syllable shall be added to the actual count of syllables in the said line, thus having a higher number of poetic syllables than the number of grammatical syllables. If the accent lies on the second to last syllable of the last word in the verse, then the final count of poetic syllables will be the same as the grammatical number of syllables. Furthermore, if the accent lies on the third to last syllable, then one syllable is subtracted from the actual count, having then less poetic syllables than grammatical syllables.

Spanish poetry uses poetic licenses, unique to Romance languages, to change the number of syllables by manipulating mainly the vowels in the line.

Regarding these poetic licenses one must consider three kinds of phenomena: (1) syneresis, (2) dieresis and (3) hiatus

There are many types of licenses, used either to add or subtract syllables, that may be applied when needed after taking in consideration the poetic rules of the last word. Yet all have in common that they only manipulate vowels that are close to each other and not interrupted by consonants.

Some common metres in Spanish verse are:
* Septenary: A line with seven poetic syllables
* Octosyllable: A line with eight poetic syllables. This metre is commonly used in &quot;romances&quot;, narrative poems similar to English ballads, and in most proverbs.
* Hendecasyllable: A line with eleven poetic syllables. This metre plays a similar role to pentameter in English verse. It is commonly used in sonnets, among other things.
* Alexandrine: A line consisting of fourteen syllables, commonly separated into two hemistichs of seven syllables each (In most languages, this term denotes a line of twelve or sometimes thirteen syllables, but not in Spanish).

===Italian===
In Italian poetry, metre is determined solely by the position of the last accent in a line, the position of the other accents being however important for verse equilibrium. Syllables are enumerated with respect to a verse which ends with a paroxytone, so that a Septenary (having seven syllables) is defined as a verse whose last accent falls on the sixth syllable: it may so contain eight syllables (&quot;Ei fu. Siccome immobile&quot;) or just six (&quot;la terra al nunzio sta&quot;). Moreover, when a word ends with a vowel and the next one starts with a vowel, they are considered to be in the same syllable (synalepha): so &quot;Gli anni e i giorni&quot; consists of only four syllables (&quot;Gli an&quot; &quot;ni e i&quot; &quot;gior&quot; &quot;ni&quot;). Even-syllabic verses have a fixed stress pattern. Because of the mostly trochaic nature of the Italian language, verses with an even number of syllables are far easier to compose, and the Novenary is usually regarded as the most difficult verse.

Some common metres in Italian verse are:
* Sexenary: A line whose last stressed syllable is on the fifth, with a fixed stress on the second one as well (&quot;Al Re Travicello / Piovuto ai ranocchi&quot;, Giusti)
* Septenary: A line whose last stressed syllable is the sixth one.
* Octosyllable: A line whose last accent falls on the seventh syllable. More often than not, the secondary accents fall on the first, third and fifth syllable, especially in nursery rhymes for which this metre is particularly well-suited.
* Hendecasyllable: A line whose last accent falls on the tenth syllable. It therefore usually consists of eleven syllables; there are various kinds of possible accentuations. It is used in sonnets, in &quot;ottava rima&quot;, and in many other types of poetry. The Divine Comedy, in particular, is composed entirely of hendecasyllables, whose main stress pattern is on the 4th and 10th syllable.

===Turkish===
Apart from Ottoman poetry, which was heavily influenced by Persian traditions and created a unique Ottoman style, traditional Turkish poetry features a system in which the number of syllables in each verse must be the same, most frequently 7, 8, 11, 14 syllables. These verses are then divided into syllable groups depending on the number of total syllables in a verse: 4+3 for 7 syllables, 4+4 or 5+3 for 8, 4+4+3 or 6+5 for 11 syllables. The end of each group in a verse is called a &quot;durak&quot; (stop), and must coincide with the last syllable of a word.

The following example is by Faruk Nafiz Çamlıbel (died 1973), one of the most devoted users of traditional Turkish metre:

In this poem the 6+5 metre is used, so that there is a word-break (&quot;durak&quot;=&quot;stop&quot;) after the sixth syllable of every line, as well as at the end of each line.

===Ottoman Turkish===
In the Ottoman Turkish language, the structures of the poetic foot (تفعل &quot;tef&#x27;ile&quot;) and of poetic metre (وزن &quot;vezin&quot;) were imitated from Persian poetry. About twelve of the most common Persian metres were used for writing Turkish poetry. As was the case with Persian, no use at all was made of the commonest metres of Arabic poetry (the &quot;tawīl&quot;, &quot;basīt&quot;, &quot;kāmil&quot;, and &quot;wāfir&quot;). However, the terminology used to describe the metres was indirectly borrowed from the Arabic poetic tradition through the medium of the Persian language.

As a result, Ottoman poetry, also known as Dîvân poetry, was generally written in quantitative, mora-timed metre. The moras, or syllables, are divided into three basic types:
* Open, or light, syllables (&quot;açık hece&quot;) consist of either a short vowel alone, or a consonant followed by a short vowel.
** Examples: a-&quot;dam&quot; (&quot;man&quot;); &quot;zir&quot;-ve (&quot;summit, peak&quot;)
* Closed, or heavy, syllables (&quot;kapalı hece&quot;) consist of either a long vowel alone, a consonant followed by a long vowel, or a short vowel followed by a consonant
** Examples: Â-&quot;dem&quot; (&quot;Adam&quot;); kâ-&quot;fir&quot; (&quot;non-Muslim&quot;); at (&quot;horse&quot;)
* Lengthened, or superheavy, syllables (&quot;meddli hece&quot;) count as one closed plus one open syllable and consist of a vowel followed by a consonant cluster, or a long vowel followed by a consonant
** Examples: kürk (&quot;fur&quot;); âb (&quot;water&quot;)

In writing out a poem&#x27;s poetic metre, open syllables are symbolized by &quot;.&quot; and closed syllables are symbolized by &quot;–&quot;. From the different syllable types, a total of sixteen different types of poetic foot—the majority of which are either three or four syllables in length—are constructed, which are named and scanned as follows:


These individual poetic feet are then combined in a number of different ways, most often with four feet per line, so as to give the poetic metre for a line of verse. Some of the most commonly used metres are the following:
* &quot;me fâ’ î lün&quot; / &quot;me fâ’ î lün&quot; / &quot;me fâ’ î lün&quot; / &quot;me fâ’ î lün&quot;. – – – / . – – – / . – – – / . – – –
::—Bâkî (1526–1600)
* &quot;me fâ i lün&quot; / &quot;fe i lâ tün&quot; / &quot;me fâ i lün&quot; / &quot;fe i lün&quot;. – . – / . . – – / . – . – / . . –
::—Şeyh Gâlib (1757–1799)
* &quot;fâ i lâ tün&quot; / &quot;fâ i lâ tün&quot; / &quot;fâ i lâ tün&quot; / &quot;fâ i lün&quot;– . – – / – . – – / – . – – / – . –
::—Nedîm (1681?–1730)
* &quot;fe i lâ tün&quot; / &quot;fe i lâ tün&quot; / &quot;fe i lâ tün&quot; / &quot;fe i lün&quot;. . – – / . . – – / . . – – / . . –
::—Fuzûlî (1483?–1556)
* &quot;mef’ û lü&quot; / &quot;me fâ î lü&quot; / &quot;me fâ î lü&quot; / &quot;fâ û lün&quot;– – . / . – – . / . – – . / – – .
::—Neşâtî (?–1674)

===Portuguese===
Portuguese poetry uses a syllabic metre in which the verse is classified according to the last stressed syllable. The Portuguese system is quite similar to those of Spanish and Italian, as they are closely related languages. The most commonly used verses are:
* &quot;Redondilha menor&quot;: composed of 5 syllables.
* &quot;Redondilha maior&quot;: composed of 7 syllables.
* Decasyllable (&quot;decassílabo&quot;): composed of 10 syllables. Mostly used in Parnassian sonnets. It is equivalent to the Italian hendecasyllable.
** Heroic (&quot;heróico&quot;): stresses on the sixth and tenth syllables.
** Sapphic (&quot;sáfico&quot;): stresses on the fourth, eighth and tenth syllables.
** &quot;Martelo&quot;: stresses on the third, sixth and tenth syllables.
** &quot;Gaita galega&quot; or &quot;moinheira&quot;: stresses on the fourth, seventh and tenth syllables.
* Dodecasyllable (&quot;dodecassílabo&quot;): composed of 12 syllables.
** Alexandrine (&quot;alexandrino&quot;): divided into two hemistiches, the sixth and the twelfth syllables are stressed.
* Barbarian (&quot;bárbaro&quot;): composed of 13 or more syllables.
** Lucasian (&quot;lucasiano&quot;): composed of 16 syllables, divided into two hemistiches of 8 syllables each.

===Welsh===

There is a continuing tradition of strict metre poetry in the Welsh language that can be traced back to at least the sixth century. At the annual National Eisteddfod of Wales the prize of a bardic chair is awarded to the composer who has submitted for adjudication the best (long poem), collection of poems or sequence of poems, that follow(s) the conventions of regarding the arrangement within the syllabically-regulated poetic line, and between lines, of stress, alliteration, rhyme and half-rhyme.

===Hungarian===
Metre has been applied in Hungarian since 1541 up to the 20th century, partly in hexameter, and partly in other forms, such as the Alcaic, the Asclepiadic, and the Sapphic stanza. Early 19th-century poet Dániel Berzsenyi&#x27;s poetry has been rendered into English faithfully to his original metre in some translations, namely by Peter Zollman, Adam Makkai, and others. 20th-century poets such as Mihály Babits, Árpád Tóth, Miklós Radnóti, Attila József, and Ágnes Nemes Nagy wrote poetry in metre. The Iliad, the Odyssey, the Aeneid and epic and lyric poetry by Horace, Ovid, and Catullus, have been translated into Hungarian in their original metre, most notably by Gábor Devecseri, as well as by other 20th-century translators.

==History==

Metrical texts are first attested in early Indo-European languages. The earliest known unambiguously metrical texts, and at the same time the only metrical texts with a claim of dating to the Late Bronze Age, are the hymns of the Rigveda. That the texts of the Ancient Near East (Sumerian, Egyptian or Semitic) should not exhibit metre is surprising, and may be partly due to the nature of Bronze Age writing. There were, in fact, attempts to reconstruct metrical qualities of the poetic portions of the Hebrew Bible, e.g. by Gustav Bickell or Julius Ley, but they remained inconclusive (see Biblical poetry). Early Iron Age metrical poetry is found in the Iranian Avesta and in the Greek works attributed to Homer and Hesiod.
Latin verse survives from the Old Latin period (), in the Saturnian metre. Persian poetry arises in the Sassanid era. Tamil poetry of the early centuries AD may be the earliest known non-Indo-European

Medieval poetry was metrical without exception, spanning traditions as diverse as European Minnesang, Trouvère or Bardic poetry, Classical Persian and Sanskrit poetry, Tang dynasty Chinese poetry or the Japanese Nara period &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;. Renaissance and Early Modern poetry in Europe is characterized by a return to templates of Classical Antiquity, a tradition begun by Petrarca&#x27;s generation and continued into the time of Shakespeare and Milton.

==Dissent==
Not all poets accept the idea that metre is a fundamental part of poetry. 20th-century American poets Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams and Robinson Jeffers believed that metre was an artificial construct imposed upon poetry rather than being innate to poetry. In an essay titled &quot;Robinson Jeffers, &amp; The Metric Fallacy&quot; Dan Schneider echoes Jeffers&#x27; sentiments: &quot;What if someone actually said to you that all music was composed of just 2 notes? Or if someone claimed that there were just 2 colors in creation? Now, ponder if such a thing were true. Imagine the clunkiness &amp; mechanicality of such music. Think of the visual arts devoid of not just color, but sepia tones, &amp; even shades of gray.&quot; Jeffers called his technique &quot;rolling stresses&quot;.

Moore went further than Jeffers, openly declaring her poetry was written in syllabic form, and wholly denying metre. These syllabic lines from her famous poem illustrate her contempt for metre and other poetic tools. Even the syllabic pattern of this poem does not remain perfectly consistent:

::::nor is it valid
::::::to discriminate against &quot;business documents and

::school-books&quot;: all these phenomena are important. One must make a distinction
:::::however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not poetry

Williams tried to form poetry whose subject matter was centered on the lives of common people. He came up with the concept of the variable foot. Williams spurned traditional metre in most of his poems, preferring what he called &quot;colloquial idioms.&quot; Another poet who turned his back on traditional concepts of metre was Britain&#x27;s Gerard Manley Hopkins. Hopkins&#x27; major innovation was what he called sprung rhythm. He claimed most poetry was written in this older rhythmic structure inherited from the Norman side of the English literary heritage, based on repeating groups of two or three syllables, with the stressed syllable falling in the same place on each repetition. Sprung rhythm is structured around feet with a variable number of syllables, generally between one and four syllables per foot, with the stress always falling on the first syllable in a foot.

<text>Majed Moqed (; 18 June 197711 September 2001) was a Saudi terrorist hijacker from al-Qaeda. He hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 and was one of five hijackers who crashed a Boeing 757 into The Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks.

Moqed studied law at a college in Saudi Arabia before joining al-Qaeda in 1999. He was personally selected by Ramzi bin al-Shibh to participate in the 9/11 attacks. Al-Shibh sent him to the United States in May 2001 to study how to carry out the attacks.

==Early life and activities==
Moqed was a law student from the small town of Al-Nakhil, Saudi Arabia (west of Medina), studying at King Fahd University&#x27;s Faculty of Administration and Economics. Before he dropped out, he was apparently recruited into al-Qaeda in 1999 along with friend Satam al-Suqami, a hijacker of American Airlines Flight 11, with whom he had earlier shared a college room.

The two trained at Khalden, a large training facility near Kabul that was run by Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi. A friend in Saudi Arabia claimed he was last seen there in 2000, before leaving to study English in the United States. In November 2000, Moqed and al-Suqami flew into Iran from Bahrain together.

Some time late in 2000, Moqed traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler&#x27;s cheques presumed to have been paid for by 9/11 financier Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including Wail al-Shehri, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami.

Known as &quot;al-Ahlaf&quot; during the preparations, Moqed then moved in with hijackers Salem al-Hazmi, Abdulaziz al-Omari and Khalid al-Mihdhar in an apartment in Paterson, New Jersey.

===2001===
Moqed first arrived to the United States on or about May 2, 2001 with Ahmed al-Ghamdi.

Later that year, Moqed, Hani Hanjour, Hazmi and Ahmed al-Ghamdi rented a minivan and travelled to Fairfield, Connecticut. There they met a contact in the parking lot of a local convenience store who provided them with false IDs. (This was possibly Eyad Alrababah, a Jordanian charged with document fraud).

Moqed was one of the five hijackers who asked for a state identity card on 2 August 2001. On 24 August, both Mihdhar and Moqed tried to purchase flight tickets from the American Airlines online ticket-merchant, but had technical difficulties resolving their address and gave up.

Employees at Advance Travel Service in Totowa, New Jersey, later claimed that Moqed and Hanjour had both purchased tickets there. They claimed that Hani Hanjour spoke very little English, and Moqed did most of the speaking. Hanjour requested a seat in the front row of the airplane. Their credit card failed to authorize, and after being told the agency did not accept personal cheques, the pair left to withdraw cash. They returned shortly afterwards and paid $1842.25 in cash. During this time, Moqed was staying in Room 343 of the &quot;Valencia Motel&quot;. On September 2, Moqed paid cash for a $30 weekly membership at Gold&#x27;s Gym in Greenbelt, Maryland.

Three days later he was seen on an ATM camera with Hani Hanjour. After the attacks, the manager at an adult video store, &quot;Adult Lingerie Center&quot;, in Beltsville claimed that Moqed had been in the store three times.

==Attacks==
On September 11 2001, Moqed arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport.

According to the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, Moqed set off the metal detector at the airport and was screened with a hand-wand. He passed the cursory inspection, and was able to board his flight at 7:50. He was seated in 12A, adjacent to Mihdhar who was in 12B. Moqed helped to hijack the plane and assisted Hani Hanjour in crashing the plane into the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., killing 189 people (64 on the plane and 125 on the ground).

The flight was scheduled to depart at 08:10, but ended up departing 10 minutes late from Gate D26 at Dulles. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. At 08:54, Flight 77 began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south, and then hijackers set the flight&#x27;s autopilot heading for Washington, D.C. Passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, and reported that the plane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives. At 09:37, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the west facade of the Pentagon, killing all 64 aboard (including the hijackers), along with 125 on the ground in the Pentagon. In the recovery process at the Pentagon, remains of all five Flight 77 hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, as not matching any DNA samples for the victims, and put into custody of the FBI.

After the attacks his family told &quot;Arab News&quot; that Moqed had been a fan of sports, and enjoyed travelling. Additionally, the U.S. announced it had found a &quot;Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Student Identity Card&quot; bearing Moqed&#x27;s name in the rubble surrounding the Pentagon. They also stated that it appeared to have been a forgery.

<text>A mimeograph machine (often abbreviated to mimeo, sometimes called a stencil duplicator or stencil machine) was a low-cost duplicating machine that worked by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper. The process was called mimeography, and a copy made by the process was a mimeograph.

Mimeographs, along with spirit duplicators and hectographs, were common technologies for printing small quantities of a document, as in office work, classroom materials, and church bulletins. For even smaller quantities, up to about five, a typist would use carbon paper. Early fanzines were printed by mimeograph because the machines and supplies were widely available and inexpensive. Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing into the 1970s, photocopying gradually displaced mimeographs, spirit duplicators, and hectographs.

==Origins==
Use of stencils is an ancient art, butthrough chemistry, papers, and pressestechniques advanced rapidly in the late nineteenth century:

===Papyrograph ===
A description of the Papyrograph method of duplication was published by David Owen: 

A major beneficiary of the invention of synthetic dyes was a document reproduction technique known as stencil duplicating. Its earliest form was invented in 1874 by Eugenio de Zuccato, a young Italian studying law in London, who called his device the Papyrograph. Zuccato&#x27;s system involved writing on a sheet of varnished paper with caustic ink, which ate through the varnish and paper fibers, leaving holes where the writing had been. This sheet – which had now become a stencil – was placed on a blank sheet of paper, and ink rolled over it so that the ink oozed through the holes, creating a duplicate on the second sheet.

The process was commercialized and Zuccato applied for a patent in 1895 having stencils prepared by typewriting.

===Electric pen===
Thomas Edison received US patent 180,857 for Autographic Printing on August 8, 1876. The patent covered the electric pen, used for making the stencil, and the flatbed duplicating press. In 1880, Edison obtained a further patent, US 224,665: &quot;Method of Preparing Autographic Stencils for Printing,&quot; which covered the making of stencils using a file plate, a grooved metal plate on which the stencil was placed which perforated the stencil when written on with a blunt metal stylus.

The word &quot;mimeograph&quot; was first used by Albert Blake Dick when he licensed Edison&#x27;s patents in 1887.

Dick received Trademark Registration no. 0356815 for the term &quot;mimeograph&quot; in the US Patent Office. It is currently listed as a dead entry, but shows the A.B. Dick Company of Chicago as the owner of the name.

Over time, the term became generic and is now an example of a genericized trademark. (&quot;Roneograph&quot;, also &quot;Roneo machine&quot;, was another trademark used for mimeograph machines, the name being a contraction of &quot;Rotary Neostyle&quot;.)

===Cyclostyle===
In 1891, David Gestetner patented his Automatic Cyclostyle. This was one of the first rotary machines that retained the flatbed, which passed back and forth under inked rollers. This invention provided for more automated, faster reproductions since the pages were produced and moved by rollers instead of pressing one single sheet at a time.

By 1900, two primary types of mimeographs had come into use: a single-drum machine and a dual-drum machine. The single-drum machine used a single drum for ink transfer to the stencil, and the dual-drum machine used two drums and silk-screens to transfer the ink to the stencils. The single drum (example Roneo) machine could be easily used for multi-color work by changing the drum – each of which contained ink of a different color. This was spot color for mastheads. Colors could not be mixed.

The mimeograph became popular because it was much cheaper than traditional print – there was neither typesetting nor skilled labor involved. One individual with a typewriter and the necessary equipment became their own printing factory, allowing for greater circulation of printed material.

==Mimeography process==
The image transfer medium was originally a stencil made from waxed mulberry paper. Later this became an immersion-coated long-fiber paper, with the coating being a plasticized nitrocellulose. This flexible waxed or coated sheet is backed by a sheet of stiff card stock, with the two sheets bound at the top.

Once prepared, the stencil is wrapped around the ink-filled drum of the rotary machine. When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper. Early flatbed machines used a kind of squeegee.

The ink originally had a lanolin base and later became an oil in water emulsion. This emulsion commonly uses turkey-red oil (sulfated castor oil) which gives it a distinctive and heavy scent.

===Preparing stencils===
One uses a regular typewriter, with a stencil setting, to create a stencil. The operator loads a stencil assemblage into the typewriter like paper and uses a switch on the typewriter to put it in stencil mode. In this mode, the part of the mechanism which lifts the ribbon between the type element and the paper is disabled so that the bare, sharp type element strikes the stencil directly. The impact of the type element displaces the coating, making the tissue paper permeable to the oil-based ink. This is called &quot;cutting a stencil&quot;.

A variety of specialized styluses were used on the stencil to render lettering, illustrations, or other artistic features by hand against a textured plastic backing plate.

Mistakes were corrected by brushing them out with a specially formulated correction fluid, and retyping once it has dried. (Obliterine was a popular brand of correction fluid in Australia and the United Kingdom.)

Stencils were also made with a thermal process, an infrared method similar to that used by early photocopiers. The common machine was a Thermofax.

Another device, called an electrostencil machine, sometimes was used to make mimeo stencils from a typed or printed original. It worked by scanning the original on a rotating drum with a moving optical head and burning through the blank stencil with an electric spark in the places where the optical head detected ink. It was slow and produced ozone. Text from electrostencils had lower resolution than that from typed stencils, although the process was good for reproducing illustrations. A skilled mimeo operator using an electrostencil and a very coarse halftone screen could make acceptable printed copies of a photograph.

During the declining years of the mimeograph, some people made stencils with early computers and dot-matrix impact printers.

===Limitations===
Unlike spirit duplicators (where the only ink available is depleted from the master image), mimeograph technology works by forcing a replenishable supply of ink through the stencil master. In theory, the mimeography process could be continued indefinitely, especially if a durable stencil master were used (e.g. a thin metal foil). In practice, most low-cost mimeo stencils gradually wear out over the course of producing several hundred copies. Typically the stencil deteriorates gradually, producing a characteristic degraded image quality until the stencil tears, abruptly ending the print run. If further copies are desired at this point, another stencil must be made.

Often, the stencil material covering the interiors of closed letterforms (e.g. &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, etc.) would fall away during continued printing, causing ink-filled letters in the copies. The stencil would gradually stretch, starting near the top where the mechanical forces were greatest, causing a characteristic &quot;mid-line sag&quot; in the textual lines of the copies, that would progress until the stencil failed completely. 

The Gestetner Company (and others) devised various methods to make mimeo stencils more durable.

Compared to spirit duplication, mimeography produced a darker, more legible image. Spirit duplicated images were usually tinted a light purple or lavender, which gradually became lighter over the course of some dozens of copies. Mimeography was often considered &quot;the next step up&quot; in quality, capable of producing hundreds of copies. Print runs beyond that level were usually produced by professional printers or, as the technology became available, xerographic copiers.

==Durability==
Mimeographed images generally have much better durability than spirit-duplicated images, since the inks are more resistant to ultraviolet light. The primary preservation challenge is the low-quality paper often used, which would yellow and degrade due to residual acid in the treated pulp from which the paper was made. In the worst case, old copies can crumble into small particles when handled. Mimeographed copies have moderate durability when acid-free paper is used.

==Contemporary use==

Gestetner, Risograph, and other companies still make and sell highly automated mimeograph-like machines that are externally similar to photocopiers. The modern version of a mimeograph, called a digital duplicator, or copyprinter, contains a scanner, a thermal head for stencil cutting, and a large roll of stencil material entirely inside the unit. The stencil material consists of a very thin polymer film laminated to a long-fiber non-woven tissue. It makes the stencils and mounts and unmounts them from the print drum automatically, making it almost as easy to operate as a photocopier. The Risograph is the best known of these machines.

Although mimeographs remain more economical and energy-efficient in mid-range quantities, easier-to-use photocopying and offset printing have replaced mimeography almost entirely in developed countries. Mimeography continues to be used in some developing countries because it is a simple, cheap, and robust technology. Many mimeographs can be hand-cranked, requiring no electricity.

==Uses and art==
Mimeographs and the closely related but distinctly different spirit duplicator process were both used extensively in schools to copy homework assignments and tests. They were also commonly used for low-budget amateur publishing, including club newsletters and church bulletins. They were especially popular with science fiction fans, who used them extensively in the production of fanzines in the middle 20th century, before photocopying became inexpensive.

Letters and typographical symbols were sometimes used to create illustrations, in a precursor to ASCII art. Because changing ink color in a mimeograph could be a laborious process, involving extensively cleaning the machine or, on newer models, replacing the drum or rollers, and then running the paper through the machine a second time, some fanzine publishers experimented with techniques for painting several colors on the pad.

In addition, mimeographs were used by many resistance groups during World War Two as a way to print illegal newspapers and publications in countries such as Belgium.

<doc id="19937" wikidata="Q60186" url="?curid=19937" title="Meteorite">
<text>A meteorite is a rock that originated in outer space and has fallen to the surface of a planet or moon. When the original object enters the atmosphere, various factors such as friction, pressure, and chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate energy. It then becomes a meteor and forms a fireball, also known as a shooting star; astronomers call the brightest examples &quot;bolides&quot;. Once it settles on the larger body&#x27;s surface, the meteor becomes a meteorite. Meteorites vary greatly in size. For geologists, a bolide is a meteorite large enough to create an impact crater.

Meteorites that are recovered after being observed as they transit the atmosphere and impact Earth are called meteorite falls. All others are known as meteorite finds. Meteorites have traditionally been divided into three broad categories: stony meteorites that are rocks, mainly composed of silicate minerals; iron meteorites that are largely composed of ferronickel; and stony-iron meteorites that contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material. Modern classification schemes divide meteorites into groups according to their structure, chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy. &quot;Meteorites&quot; less than ~1 mm in diameter are classified as micrometeorites, however micrometeorites differ from meteorites in that they typically melt completely in the atmosphere and fall to Earth as quenched droplets. Extraterrestrial meteorites have been found on the Moon and on Mars.

Most space rocks crashing into Earth come from a single source. The origin of most meteorites can be traced to just a handful of asteroid breakup events – and possibly even individual asteroids.

==Fall phenomena==
Most meteoroids disintegrate when entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Usually, five to ten a year are observed to fall and are subsequently recovered and made known to scientists. Few meteorites are large enough to create large impact craters. Instead, they typically arrive at the surface at their terminal velocity and, at most, create a small pit.


Large meteoroids may strike the earth with a significant fraction of their escape velocity (second cosmic velocity), leaving behind a hypervelocity impact crater. The kind of crater will depend on the size, composition, degree of fragmentation, and incoming angle of the impactor. The force of such collisions has the potential to cause widespread destruction. The most frequent hypervelocity cratering events on the Earth are caused by iron meteoroids, which are most easily able to transit the atmosphere intact. Examples of craters caused by iron meteoroids include Barringer Meteor Crater, Odessa Meteor Crater, Wabar craters, and Wolfe Creek crater; iron meteorites are found in association with all of these craters. In contrast, even relatively large stony or icy bodies such as small comets or asteroids, up to millions of tons, are disrupted in the atmosphere, and do not make impact craters. Although such disruption events are uncommon, they can cause a considerable concussion to occur; the famed Tunguska event probably resulted from such an incident. Very large stony objects, hundreds of meters in diameter or more, weighing tens of millions of tons or more, can reach the surface and cause large craters but are very rare. Such events are generally so energetic that the impactor is completely destroyed, leaving no meteorites. (The first example of a stony meteorite found in association with a large impact crater, the Morokweng impact structure in South Africa, was reported in May 2006.)

Several phenomena are well documented during witnessed meteorite falls too small to produce hypervelocity craters. The fireball that occurs as the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere can appear to be very bright, rivaling the sun in intensity, although most are far dimmer and may not even be noticed during the daytime. Various colors have been reported, including yellow, green, and red. Flashes and bursts of light can occur as the object breaks up. Explosions, detonations, and rumblings are often heard during meteorite falls, which can be caused by sonic booms as well as shock waves resulting from major fragmentation events. These sounds can be heard over wide areas, with a radius of a hundred or more kilometers. Whistling and hissing sounds are also sometimes heard but are poorly understood. Following the passage of the fireball, it is not unusual for a dust trail to linger in the atmosphere for several minutes.

As meteoroids are heated during atmospheric entry, their surfaces melt and experience ablation. They can be sculpted into various shapes during this process, sometimes resulting in shallow thumbprint-like indentations on their surfaces called s. If the meteoroid maintains a fixed orientation for some time, without tumbling, it may develop a conical &quot;nose cone&quot; or &quot;heat shield&quot; shape. As it decelerates, eventually the molten surface layer solidifies into a thin fusion crust, which on most meteorites is black (on some achondrites, the fusion crust may be very light-colored). On stony meteorites, the heat-affected zone is at most a few mm deep; in iron meteorites, which are more thermally conductive, the structure of the metal may be affected by heat up to below the surface. Reports vary; some meteorites are reported to be &quot;burning hot to the touch&quot; upon landing, while others are alleged to have been cold enough to condense water and form a frost.

Meteoroids that disintegrate in the atmosphere may fall as meteorite showers, which can range from only a few up to thousands of separate individuals. The area over which a meteorite shower falls is known as its strewn field. Strewn fields are commonly elliptical in shape, with the major axis parallel to the direction of flight. In most cases, the largest meteorites in a shower are found farthest down-range in the strewn field.

== Classification ==
Most meteorites are stony meteorites, classed as chondrites and achondrites. Only about 6% of meteorites are iron meteorites or a blend of rock and metal, the stony-iron meteorites. Modern classification of meteorites is complex. The review paper of Krot et al. (2007) summarizes modern meteorite taxonomy.

About 86% of the meteorites are chondrites, which are named for the small, round particles they contain. These particles, or chondrules, are composed mostly of silicate minerals that appear to have been melted while they were free-floating objects in space. Certain types of chondrites also contain small amounts of organic matter, including amino acids, and presolar grains. Chondrites are typically about 4.55 billion years old and are thought to represent material from the asteroid belt that never coalesced into large bodies. Like comets, chondritic asteroids are some of the oldest and most primitive materials in the Solar System. Chondrites are often considered to be &quot;the building blocks of the planets&quot;.

About 8% of the meteorites are achondrites (meaning they do not contain chondrules), some of which are similar to terrestrial igneous rocks. Most achondrites are also ancient rocks, and are thought to represent crustal material of differentiated planetesimals. One large family of achondrites (the HED meteorites) may have originated on the parent body of the Vesta Family, although this claim is disputed. Others derive from unidentified asteroids. Two small groups of achondrites are special, as they are younger and do not appear to come from the asteroid belt. One of these groups comes from the Moon, and includes rocks similar to those brought back to Earth by Apollo and Luna programs. The other group is almost certainly from Mars and constitutes the only materials from other planets ever recovered by humans.

About 5% of meteorites that have been seen to fall are iron meteorites composed of iron-nickel alloys, such as kamacite and/or taenite. Most iron meteorites are thought to come from the cores of planetesimals that were once molten. As with the Earth, the denser metal separated from silicate material and sank toward the center of the planetesimal, forming its core. After the planetesimal solidified, it broke up in a collision with another planetesimal. Due to the low abundance of iron meteorites in collection areas such as Antarctica, where most of the meteoric material that has fallen can be recovered, it is possible that the percentage of iron-meteorite falls is lower than 5%. This would be explained by a recovery bias; laypeople are more likely to notice and recover solid masses of metal than most other meteorite types. The abundance of iron meteorites relative to total Antarctic finds is 0.4%.

Stony-iron meteorites constitute the remaining 1%. They are a mixture of iron-nickel metal and silicate minerals. One type, called pallasites, is thought to have originated in the boundary zone above the core regions where iron meteorites originated. The other major type of stony-iron meteorites is the mesosiderites.

Tektites (from Greek &quot;tektos&quot;, molten) are not themselves meteorites, but are rather natural glass objects up to a few centimeters in size that were formed—according to most scientists—by the impacts of large meteorites on Earth&#x27;s surface. A few researchers have favored tektites originating from the Moon as volcanic ejecta, but this theory has lost much of its support over the last few decades.

== Frequency ==
The diameter of the largest impactor to hit Earth on any given day is likely to be about , in a given year about , and in a given century about . These statistics are obtained by the following:

Over at least the range from to roughly , the rate at which Earth receives meteors obeys a power-law distribution as follows:

:formula_1

where &quot;N&quot; (&gt;&quot;D&quot;) is the expected number of objects larger than a diameter of &quot;D&quot; meters to hit Earth in a year. This is based on observations of bright meteors seen from the ground and space, combined with surveys of near-Earth asteroids. Above in diameter, the predicted rate is somewhat higher, with a 2 km (1.2 mi) asteroid (one teraton TNT equivalent) every couple of million yearsabout 10 times as often as the power-law extrapolation would predict.

==Chemistry==
In 2015, NASA scientists reported that complex organic compounds found in DNA and RNA, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds, according to the scientists.

In 2018, researchers found that 4.5 billion-year-old meteorites found on Earth contained liquid water along with prebiotic complex organic substances that may be ingredients for life.

In 2019, scientists reported detecting sugar molecules in meteorites for the first time, including ribose, suggesting that chemical processes on asteroids can produce some organic compounds fundamental to life, and supporting the notion of an RNA world prior to a DNA-based origin of life on Earth.

In 2022, a Japanese group reported that they had found adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and uracil (U) inside carbon-rich meteorites. These compounds 
are building blocks of DNA and RNA, the genetic code of all life on Earth. These compounds have also occurred spontaneously in laboratory settings emulating conditions in outer space.

==Sources of meteorites found on Earth==
Until recently, the source of only about 6% of meteorites had been traced to their sources: the Moon, Mars, and asteroid Vesta. Approximately 70% of meteorites found on Earth now appear to originate from break-ups of three asteroids.

==Weathering==

Most meteorites date from the early Solar System and are by far the oldest extant material on Earth. Analysis of terrestrial weathering due to water, salt, oxygen, etc. is used to quantify the degree of alteration that a meteorite has experienced. Several qualitative weathering indices have been applied to Antarctic and desertic samples.

The most commonly employed weathering scale, used for ordinary chondrites, ranges from W0 (pristine state) to W6 (heavy alteration).

===Fossil meteorites===
&quot;Fossil&quot; meteorites are sometimes discovered by geologists. They represent the highly weathered remains of meteorites that fell to Earth in the remote past and were preserved in sedimentary deposits sufficiently well that they can be recognized through mineralogical and geochemical studies. The Thorsberg limestone quarry in Sweden has produced an anomalously large number – exceeding one hundred – fossil meteorites from the Ordovician, nearly all of which are highly weathered L-chondrites that still resemble the original meteorite under a petrographic microscope, but which have had their original material almost entirely replaced by terrestrial secondary mineralization. The extraterrestrial provenance was demonstrated in part through isotopic analysis of relict spinel grains, a mineral that is common in meteorites, is insoluble in water, and is able to persist chemically unchanged in the terrestrial weathering environment. Scientists believe that these meteorites, which have all also been found in Russia and China, all originated from the same source, a collision that occurred somewhere between Jupiter and Mars. One of these fossil meteorites, dubbed Österplana 065, appears to represent a distinct type of meteorite that is &quot;extinct&quot; in the sense that it is no longer falling to Earth, the parent body having already been completely depleted from the reservoir of near-Earth objects.

==Collection==

A &quot;meteorite fall&quot;, also called an &quot;observed fall&quot;, is a meteorite collected after its arrival was observed by people or automated devices. Any other meteorite is called a &quot;meteorite find&quot;. There are more than 1,100 documented falls listed in widely used databases, most of which have specimens in modern collections. , the &quot;Meteoritical Bulletin Database&quot; had 1,180 confirmed falls.

===Falls===
Most meteorite falls are collected on the basis of eyewitness accounts of the fireball or the impact of the object on the ground, or both. Therefore, despite the fact that meteorites fall with virtually equal probability everywhere on Earth, verified meteorite falls tend to be concentrated in areas with higher human population densities such as Europe, Japan, and northern India.

A small number of meteorite falls have been observed with automated cameras and recovered following calculation of the impact point. The first of these was the Příbram meteorite, which fell in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) in 1959. In this case, two cameras used to photograph meteors captured images of the fireball. The images were used both to determine the location of the stones on the ground and, more significantly, to calculate for the first time an accurate orbit for a recovered meteorite.

Following the Příbram fall, other nations established automated observing programs aimed at studying infalling meteorites. One of these was the &quot;Prairie Network&quot;, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory from 1963 to 1975 in the midwestern US. This program also observed a meteorite fall, the &quot;Lost City&quot; chondrite, allowing its recovery and a calculation of its orbit. Another program in Canada, the Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project, ran from 1971 to 1985. It too recovered a single meteorite, &quot;Innisfree&quot;, in 1977. Finally, observations by the European Fireball Network, a descendant of the original Czech program that recovered Příbram, led to the discovery and orbit calculations for the &quot;Neuschwanstein&quot; meteorite in 2002. NASA has an automated system that detects meteors and calculates the orbit, magnitude, ground track, and other parameters over the southeast USA, which often detects a number of events each night.

===Finds===

Until the twentieth century, only a few hundred meteorite finds had ever been discovered. More than 80% of these were iron and stony-iron meteorites, which are easily distinguished from local rocks. To this day, few stony meteorites are reported each year that can be considered to be &quot;accidental&quot; finds. The reason there are now more than 30,000 meteorite finds in the world&#x27;s collections started with the discovery by Harvey H. Nininger that meteorites are much more common on the surface of the Earth than was previously thought.

==== Canada ====
Meteorites that land in Canada are protected under the &quot;Cultural Property Export and Import Act&quot;. In July 2024, a meteorite was recorded by security footage crashing into a residential property in Marshfield, Prince Edward Island. It is believed to be the first time such an event has been captured on camera and the sound of the crash recorded. It was subsequently registered as the Charlottetown meteorite, named after the city near to where it landed.

====United States====
Nininger&#x27;s strategy was to search for meteorites in the Great Plains of the United States, where the land was largely cultivated and the soil contained few rocks. Between the late 1920s and the 1950s, he traveled across the region, educating local people about what meteorites looked like and what to do if they thought they had found one, for example, in the course of clearing a field. The result was the discovery of more than 200 new meteorites, mostly stony types.

In the late 1960s, Roosevelt County, New Mexico was found to be a particularly good place to find meteorites. After the discovery of a few meteorites in 1967, a public awareness campaign resulted in the finding of nearly 100 new specimens in the next few years, with many being by a single person, Ivan Wilson. In total, nearly 140 meteorites were found in the region since 1967. In the area of the finds, the ground was originally covered by a shallow, loose soil sitting atop a hardpan layer. During the dustbowl era, the loose soil was blown off, leaving any rocks and meteorites that were present stranded on the exposed surface.

Beginning in the mid-1960s, amateur meteorite hunters began scouring the arid areas of the southwestern United States. To date, thousands of meteorites have been recovered from the Mojave, Sonoran, Great Basin, and Chihuahuan Deserts, with many being recovered on dry lake beds. Significant finds include the three-tonne Old Woman meteorite, currently on display at the Desert Discovery Center in Barstow, California, and the Franconia and Gold Basin meteorite strewn fields; hundreds of kilograms of meteorites have been recovered from each. A number of finds from the American Southwest have been submitted with false find locations, as many finders think it is unwise to publicly share that information for fear of confiscation by the federal government and competition with other hunters at published find sites. Several of the meteorites found recently are currently on display in the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, and at UCLA&#x27;s Meteorite Gallery.

====Antarctica====
A few meteorites were found in Antarctica between 1912 and 1964. In 1969, the 10th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition found nine meteorites on a blue ice field near the Yamato Mountains. With this discovery, came the realization that movement of ice sheets might act to concentrate meteorites in certain areas. After a dozen other specimens were found in the same place in 1973, a Japanese expedition was launched in 1974 dedicated to the search for meteorites. This team recovered nearly 700 meteorites.

Shortly thereafter, the United States began its own program to search for Antarctic meteorites, operating along the Transantarctic Mountains on the other side of the continent: the Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET) program. European teams, starting with a consortium called &quot;EUROMET&quot; in the 1990/91 season, and continuing with a program by the Italian Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide have also conducted systematic searches for Antarctic meteorites.

The Antarctic Scientific Exploration of China has conducted successful meteorite searches since 2000. A Korean program (KOREAMET) was launched in 2007 and has collected a few meteorites. The combined efforts of all of these expeditions have produced more than 23,000 classified meteorite specimens since 1974, with thousands more that have not yet been classified. For more information see the article by Harvey (2003).

====Australia====
At about the same time as meteorite concentrations were being discovered in the cold desert of Antarctica, collectors discovered that many meteorites could also be found in the hot deserts of Australia. Several dozen meteorites had already been found in the Nullarbor region of Western and South Australia. Systematic searches between about 1971 and the present recovered more than 500 others, ~300 of which are currently well characterized. The meteorites can be found in this region because the land presents a flat, featureless, plain covered by limestone. In the extremely arid climate, there has been relatively little weathering or sedimentation on the surface for tens of thousands of years, allowing meteorites to accumulate without being buried or destroyed. The dark-colored meteorites can then be recognized among the very different looking limestone pebbles and rocks.

====The Sahara====

In 1986–87, a German team installing a network of seismic stations while prospecting for oil discovered about 65 meteorites on a flat, desert plain about southeast of Dirj (Daraj), Libya. A few years later, a desert enthusiast saw photographs of meteorites being recovered by scientists in Antarctica, and thought that he had seen similar occurrences in northern Africa. In 1989, he recovered about 100 meteorites from several distinct locations in Libya and Algeria. Over the next several years, he and others who followed found at least 400 more meteorites. The find locations were generally in regions known as regs or hamadas: flat, featureless areas covered only by small pebbles and minor amounts of sand. Dark-colored meteorites can be easily spotted in these places. In the case of several meteorite fields, such as Dar al Gani, Dhofar, and others, favorable light-colored geology consisting of basic rocks (clays, dolomites, and limestones) makes meteorites particularly easy to identify.

Although meteorites had been sold commercially and collected by hobbyists for many decades, up to the time of the Saharan finds of the late 1980s and early 1990s, most meteorites were deposited in or purchased by museums and similar institutions where they were exhibited and made available for scientific research. The sudden availability of large numbers of meteorites that could be found with relative ease in places that were readily accessible (especially compared to Antarctica), led to a rapid rise in commercial collection of meteorites. This process was accelerated when, in 1997, meteorites coming from both the Moon and Mars were found in Libya. By the late 1990s, private meteorite-collecting expeditions had been launched throughout the Sahara. Specimens of the meteorites recovered in this way are still deposited in research collections, but most of the material is sold to private collectors. These expeditions have now brought the total number of well-described meteorites found in Algeria and Libya to more than 500.

====Northwest Africa====

Meteorite markets came into existence in the late 1990s, especially in Morocco. This trade was driven by Western commercialization and an increasing number of collectors. The meteorites were supplied by nomads and local people who combed the deserts looking for specimens to sell. Many thousands of meteorites have been distributed in this way, most of which lack any information about how, when, or where they were discovered. These are the so-called &quot;Northwest Africa&quot; meteorites. When they get classified, they are named &quot;Northwest Africa&quot; (abbreviated NWA) followed by a number. It is generally accepted that NWA meteorites originate in Morocco, Algeria, Western Sahara, Mali, and possibly even further afield. Nearly all of these meteorites leave Africa through Morocco. Scores of important meteorites, including Lunar and Martian ones, have been discovered and made available to science via this route. A few of the more notable meteorites recovered include Tissint and Northwest Africa 7034. Tissint was the first witnessed Martian meteorite fall in more than fifty years; NWA 7034 is the oldest meteorite known to come from Mars, and is a unique water-bearing regolith breccia.

====Arabian Peninsula====

In 1999, meteorite hunters discovered that the desert in southern and central Oman were also favorable for the collection of many specimens. The gravel plains in the Dhofar and Al Wusta regions of Oman, south of the sandy deserts of the Rub&#x27; al Khali, had yielded about 5,000 meteorites as of mid-2009. Included among these are a large number of lunar and Martian meteorites, making Oman a particularly important area both for scientists and collectors. Early expeditions to Oman were mainly done by commercial meteorite dealers, however, international teams of Omani and European scientists have also now collected specimens.

The recovery of meteorites from Oman is currently prohibited by national law, but a number of international hunters continue to remove specimens now deemed national treasures. This new law provoked a small international incident, as its implementation preceded any public notification of such a law, resulting in the prolonged imprisonment of a large group of meteorite hunters, primarily from Russia, but whose party also consisted of members from the US as well as several other European countries.

==In human affairs==
Meteorites have figured into human culture since their earliest discovery as ceremonial or religious objects, as the subject of writing about events occurring in the sky and as a source of peril. The oldest known iron artifacts are nine small beads hammered from meteoritic iron. They were found in northern Egypt and have been securely dated to 3200 BC.

===Ceremonial or religious use===
Although the use of the metal found in meteorites is also recorded in myths of many countries and cultures where the celestial source was often acknowledged, scientific documentation only began in the last few centuries.

Meteorite falls may have been the source of cultish worship. The cult in the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, possibly originated with the observation and recovery of a meteorite that was understood by contemporaries to have fallen to the earth from Jupiter, the principal Roman deity. There are reports that a sacred stone was enshrined at the temple that may have been a meteorite.

The Black Stone set into the wall of the Kaaba has often been presumed to be a meteorite, but the little available evidence for this is inconclusive.

Some Native Americans treated meteorites as ceremonial objects. In 1915, a iron meteorite was found in a Sinagua (c. 1100–1200 AD) burial cyst near Camp Verde, Arizona, respectfully wrapped in a feather cloth. A small pallasite was found in a pottery jar in an old burial found at Pojoaque Pueblo, New Mexico. Nininger reports several other such instances, in the Southwest US and elsewhere, such as the discovery of Native American beads of meteoric iron found in Hopewell burial mounds, and the discovery of the Winona meteorite in a Native American stone-walled crypt.

===Historical writings===
In medieval China during the Song dynasty, a meteorite strike event was recorded by Shen Kuo in 1064 AD near Changzhou. He reported &quot;a loud noise that sounded like a thunder was heard in the sky; a giant star, almost like the moon, appeared in the southeast&quot; and later finding the crater and the still-hot meteorite within, nearby.

Two of the oldest recorded meteorite falls in Europe are the Elbogen (1400) and Ensisheim (1492) meteorites. The German physicist, Ernst Florens Chladni, was the first to publish (in 1794) the idea that meteorites might be rocks that originated not from Earth, but from space. His booklet was &quot;On the Origin of the Iron Masses Found by Pallas and Others Similar to it, and on Some Associated Natural Phenomena&quot;. In this he compiled all available data on several meteorite finds and falls concluded that they must have their origins in outer space. The scientific community of the time responded with resistance and mockery. It took nearly ten years before a general acceptance of the origin of meteorites was achieved through the work of the French scientist Jean-Baptiste Biot and the British chemist, Edward Howard. Biot&#x27;s study, initiated by the French Academy of Sciences, was compelled by a fall of thousands of meteorites on 26 April 1803 from the skies of L&#x27;Aigle, France.

=== Striking people or property ===

Throughout history, many first- and second-hand reports speak of meteorites killing humans and other animals. One example is from 1490 AD in China, which purportedly killed thousands of people. John Lewis has compiled some of these reports, and summarizes, &quot;No one in recorded history has ever been killed by a meteorite in the presence of a meteoriticist and a medical doctor&quot; and &quot;reviewers who make sweeping negative conclusions usually do not cite any of the primary publications in which the eyewitnesses describe their experiences, and give no evidence of having read them&quot;.

Modern reports of meteorite strikes include:
*In 1954 in Sylacauga, Alabama. A stone chondrite, the Hodges meteorite or Sylacauga meteorite, crashed through a roof and injured an occupant.
*An approximately fragment of the Mbale meteorite fall from Uganda struck a youth, causing no injury.
*In October 2021 a meteorite penetrated the roof of a house in Golden, British Columbia landing on an occupant&#x27;s bed.

==Notable examples==
===Naming===
Meteorites are always named for the places they were found, where practical, usually a nearby town or geographic feature. In cases where many meteorites were found in one place, the name may be followed by a number or letter (e.g., Allan Hills 84001 or Dimmitt (b)). The name designated by the Meteoritical Society is used by scientists, catalogers, and most collectors.

<text>Mega is a unit prefix in metric systems of units denoting a factor of one million (106 or ). It has the unit symbol M. It was confirmed for use in the International System of Units (SI) in 1960. &quot;Mega&quot; comes from .

==Common examples of usage==
* Megapixel: 1 million pixels in a digital camera
* One megatonne of TNT equivalent amounts to approx. 4 petajoules and is the approximate energy released on igniting one million tonnes of TNT. The unit is often used in measuring the explosive power of nuclear weapons. 
* Megahertz: frequency of electromagnetic radiation for radio and television broadcasting, GSM, etc. 1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz.
* Megabyte: unit of information equal to one million bytes (SI standard).
* Megawatt: equal to one million watts of power. It is commonly used to measure the output of power plants, as well as the power consumption of electric locomotives, data centers, and other entities that heavily consume electricity.
* Megadeath: (or megacorpse) is one million human deaths, usually used in reference to projected number of deaths from a nuclear explosion. The term was used by scientists and thinkers who strategized likely outcomes of all-out nuclear warfare.

==Exponentiation==
When units occur in exponentiation, such as in square and cubic forms, any multiples-prefix is considered part of the unit, and thus included in the exponentiation.
* 1 Mm2 means one square megametre or the size of a square of by or , and not (106 m2).
* 1 Mm3 means one cubic megametre or the size of a cube of by by or 1018 m3, and not (106 m3)

==Computing==
In some fields of computing, &quot;mega&quot; may sometimes denote (220) information units, for example, a megabyte, a megaword, but denotes (106) units of other quantities, for example, transfer rates: = . 
In the case of 3½-inch floppy disks, sizes were given in megabytes of 1000KB or bytes.
The prefix &quot;mebi-&quot; has been suggested as a prefix for 220 to avoid ambiguity.

<text>Mark Kendall Bingham (May 22, 1970 – September 11, 2001) was an American public relations executive who founded his own company, the Bingham Group. During the September 11 attacks in 2001, he was a passenger on board United Airlines Flight 93. Bingham was among the passengers who, along with Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett and Jeremy Glick, formed the plan to retake the plane from the hijackers, and led the effort that resulted in the crash of the plane into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, thwarting the hijackers&#x27; plan to crash the plane into a building in Washington, D.C., most likely either the U.S. Capitol Building or the White House.

Bingham&#x27;s efforts on United Flight 93, as well as his athletic physique, were noted for having prompted a reassessment of gay stereotypes.

==Early life==
Mark Bingham was born on May 22, 1970, the only child of Alice Hoagland and Gerald Bingham. When Mark was two years old, his parents divorced. Raised by his mother and her family, Mark grew up in Miami, Florida, and Southern California before moving to the San Jose area in 1983. Bingham was an aspiring filmmaker, and as a teenager, he began using a video camera as a personal diary to document his life and those of his family and friends. He graduated from Los Gatos High School as a two-year captain of his rugby team in 1988. As an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, Bingham played on two of Coach Jack Clark&#x27;s national-championship-winning rugby teams in the early 1990s. He also joined the Chi Psi fraternity, eventually becoming its president. Upon graduation at the age of 21, Bingham came out as gay to his family and friends.

==Rugby and business career==
A large athlete at and , Bingham also played for the gay-inclusive rugby union team San Francisco Fog RFC. Bingham played No. 8 in their first two friendly matches. He played in their first tournament, and taught his teammates his favorite rugby songs.

At the time of his death, Bingham had recently opened a satellite office of his public relations firm in New York City and was spending more time on the East Coast. He discussed plans with his friend Scott Glaessgen to form a New York City rugby team, the Gotham Knights.

==September 11, 2001==
On the morning of September 11, Bingham overslept and nearly missed his flight, on his way to San Francisco to be an usher in his fraternity brother Joseph Salama&#x27;s wedding. He arrived at Terminal A at Newark International Airport at 7:40 am, ran to Gate 17, and was the last passenger to board United Airlines Flight 93, taking seat 4D, next to passenger Tom Burnett.

United Airlines Flight 93 was scheduled to depart at 8:00 am, but the plane did not depart until 42 minutes later due to runway traffic delays. Four minutes later, American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center&#x27;s North Tower. At 9:03 am, as United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower, Flight 93 climbed to cruising altitude, heading west over New Jersey and into Pennsylvania. At 9:25 am, Flight 93 was above eastern Ohio, and pilots Jason Dahl and LeRoy Homer received an alert, &quot;Beware of cockpit intrusion,&quot; on the cockpit computer device ACARS (Aircraft Communications and Reporting System). Three minutes later, Cleveland controllers could hear screams over the cockpit&#x27;s open microphone. Moments later, the hijackers, led by the Lebanese Ziad Jarrah, took over the plane&#x27;s controls and told passengers, &quot;Keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on board&quot;. Bingham and the other passengers were herded into the back of the plane. Within six minutes, the plane changed course and headed for Washington, D.C. Several of the passengers made phone calls to loved ones, who informed them about the two planes that had crashed into the World Trade Center.

After the hijackers veered the plane sharply south, the passengers decided to act. Bingham, along with Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett, and Jeremy Glick, formed a plan to take the plane back from the hijackers. They relayed this plan to their loved ones and the authorities via telephone. Bingham got through to his aunt&#x27;s home in California. Bingham stated, &quot;This is Mark Bingham. I want to let you guys know that I love you, in case I don&#x27;t see you again...I&#x27;m on United Airlines, Flight 93. It&#x27;s being hijacked.&quot; According to &quot;The Week&quot;, Hoagland formed the impression that her son spoke &quot;confidentially&quot; with a fellow passenger, to form a plan to retake the plane. According to ABC News, the call cut off after about three minutes. Hoagland, after seeing news reports of the plane&#x27;s hijacking, called him back and left two messages for him, calmly saying, &quot;Mark, this is your mom. The news is that it&#x27;s been hijacked by terrorists. They are planning to probably use the plane as a target to hit some site on the ground. I would say go ahead and do everything you can to overpower them, because they are hellbent. Try to call me back if you can.&quot; Bingham, Burnett, and Glick were each more than tall, well-built and fit. As they made their decision to retake the plane, Glick related this over the phone to his wife, Lyz. Fellow passenger Todd Beamer, speaking to GTE-Verizon Lisa Jefferson and the FBI, related that he too was part of this group. They were joined by other passengers, including Lou Nacke, Rich Guadagno, Alan Beaven, Honor Elizabeth Wainio, Linda Gronlund, and William Cashman, along with flight attendants Sandra Bradshaw and Cee Cee Ross-Lyles, in discussing their options and voting on a course of action, ultimately deciding to storm the cockpit and take over the plane.

According to the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, after the plane&#x27;s voice data recorder was recovered, it revealed pounding and crashing sounds against the cockpit door and shouts and screams in English. &quot;Let&#x27;s get them!&quot; a passenger cries. A hijacker shouts, &quot;Allāhu ʾakbar!&quot; (&quot;God is great&quot;). Jarrah repeatedly pitched the plane to knock passengers off their feet, but the passengers apparently managed to invade the cockpit, where one was heard shouting, &quot;In the cockpit. If we don&#x27;t, we&#x27;ll die.&quot; At 10:02 am, a hijacker ordered, &quot;Pull it down! Pull it down!&quot; The 9/11 Commission later reported that the plane&#x27;s control wheel was turned hard to the right, causing it to roll on its back and plow into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at , killing everyone on board. The plane was 20 minutes of flying time away from its suspected target, the White House or the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. According to Vice President Dick Cheney, President George W. Bush gave the order to shoot the plane down.

==Legacy==

Bingham is survived by his parents and the Hoagland family members who played a part in his upbringing, by his stepmother and various stepsiblings, and by his partner of six years, Paul Holm. Holm described Bingham as a brave, competitive man, saying, &quot;He hated to lose—at anything.&quot; He was known to proudly display a scar he received after being gored at the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain. He is buried at Madronia Cemetery, Saratoga, California.
U.S. Senators John McCain and Barbara Boxer honored Bingham on September 17, 2001, in a ceremony for San Francisco Bay Area victims of the attacks, presenting a folded American flag to Paul Holm.

The Mark Kendall Bingham Memorial Tournament (referred to as the Bingham Cup), a biennial international rugby union competition predominantly for gay and bisexual men, was established in 2002 in his memory.

Bingham, along with the other passengers on Flight 93, was posthumously awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award in 2002.

The Eureka Valley Recreation Center&#x27;s Gymnasium in San Francisco was renamed the Mark Bingham Gymnasium in August 2002.

Singer Melissa Etheridge dedicated the song &quot;Tuesday Morning&quot; in 2004 to his memory.

Beginning in 2005, the UC Berkeley Foundation and the California Alumni Association named the Mark Bingham Award for Excellence in Achievement by Young Alumni in his honor. According to the university, the goal of the award is to honor &quot;a young alumnus/a who graduated within the last 10 years who has made a significant contribution to his/her community, country, or the world at large.&quot; The award is presented at the school&#x27;s annual Berkeley Charter Gala.

At the National 9/11 Memorial, Bingham and other passengers from Flight 93 are memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-67.

At the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania, Bingham&#x27;s name is located on one of the 40 panels of polished, granite that comprise the Memorial&#x27;s Wall of Names.

The 2013 feature-length documentary &quot;The Rugby Player&quot; focuses on Bingham and the bond he had with his mother, Alice Hoagland, a former United Airlines flight attendant who, following his death, became an authority on airline safety and a champion of LGBT rights. Described by ESPN as &quot;an insightful and stereotype-shattering exploration&quot; of Bingham&#x27;s life, the film, directed by Scott Gracheff, relies on the vast amount of video footage Bingham himself shot beginning in his teens until weeks before his death. The film&#x27;s alternate title, &quot;With You&quot;, is a popular rugby term, and one of Bingham&#x27;s favorite expressions. The film premiered on Australia&#x27;s ABC2 on August 20, 2014.

== In popular culture ==
*Television film &quot;The Flight That Fought Back&quot; (2005) portrays the passenger uprising inside the hijacked United Airlines 93, with actor Jason LeGrande portraying Mark Bingham.
*He has been portrayed by American actor Cheyenne Jackson in &quot;United 93&quot; and Canadian actor Ty Olsson in &quot;Flight 93&quot;.
* Mark was also referenced, although not by name, in the song Tuesday Morning by Melissa Etheridge on her Breakdown album.

<text>In articulatory phonetics, the manner of articulation is the configuration and interaction of the articulators (speech organs such as the tongue, lips, and palate) when making a speech sound. One parameter of manner is &quot;stricture,&quot; that is, how closely the speech organs approach one another. Others include those involved in the r-like sounds (taps and trills), and the sibilancy of fricatives.

The concept of manner is mainly used in the discussion of consonants, although the movement of the articulators will also greatly alter the resonant properties of the vocal tract, thereby changing the formant structure of speech sounds that is crucial for the identification of vowels. For consonants, the place of articulation and the degree of phonation or voicing are considered separately from manner, as being independent parameters. Homorganic consonants, which have the same place of articulation, may have different manners of articulation. Often nasality and laterality are included in manner, but some phoneticians, such as Peter Ladefoged, consider them to be independent.

==Broad classifications==

Manners of articulation with substantial obstruction of the airflow (stops, fricatives, affricates) are called obstruents. These are prototypically voiceless, but voiced obstruents are extremely common as well. Manners without such obstruction (nasals, liquids, approximants, and also vowels) are called sonorants because they are nearly always voiced. Voiceless sonorants are uncommon, but are found in Welsh and Classical Greek (the spelling &quot;rh&quot;), in Standard Tibetan (the &quot;lh&quot; of Lhasa), and the &quot;wh&quot; in those dialects of English that distinguish &quot;which&quot; from &quot;witch&quot;.

Sonorants may also be called resonants, and some linguists prefer that term, restricting the word &#x27;sonorant&#x27; to non-vocoid resonants (that is, nasals and liquids, but not vowels or semi-vowels). Another common distinction is between occlusives (stops, nasals and affricates) and continuants (all else).

==Stricture==

From greatest to least stricture, speech sounds may be classified along a as stop consonants (with &quot;occlusion&quot;, or blocked airflow), fricative consonants (with partially blocked and therefore strongly turbulent airflow), approximants (with only slight turbulence), tense vowels, and finally lax vowels (with full unimpeded airflow). Affricates often behave as if they were intermediate between stops and fricatives, but phonetically they are sequences of a stop and fricative.

Over time, sounds in a language may move along the cline toward less stricture in a process called lenition or towards more stricture in a process called fortition.

==Other parameters==

Sibilants are distinguished from other fricatives by the shape of the tongue and how the airflow is directed over the teeth. Fricatives at coronal places of articulation may be sibilant or non-sibilant, sibilants being the more common.

Flaps (also called taps) are similar to very brief stops. However, their articulation and behavior are distinct enough to be considered a separate manner, rather than just length. The main articulatory difference between flaps and stops is that, due to the greater length of stops compared to flaps, a build-up of air pressure occurs behind a stop which does not occur behind a flap. This means that when the stop is released, there is a burst of air as the pressure is relieved, while for flaps there is no such burst.

Trills involve the vibration of one of the speech organs. Since trilling is a separate parameter from stricture, the two may be combined. Increasing the stricture of a typical trill results in a trilled fricative. Trilled affricates are also known.

Nasal airflow may be added as an independent parameter to any speech sound. It is most commonly found in nasal occlusives and nasal vowels, but nasalized fricatives, taps, and approximants are also found. When a sound is not nasal, it is called &quot;oral.&quot;

Laterality is the release of airflow at the side of the tongue. This can be combined with other manners, resulting in lateral approximants (such as the pronunciation of the letter L in the English word &quot;let&quot;), lateral flaps, and lateral fricatives and affricates.

==Individual manners==

* Plosive, often called stop, is an oral occlusive, where there is &quot;occlusion&quot; (blocking) of the oral vocal tract, and no nasal air flow, so the air flow stops completely. Examples include English (voiceless) and (voiced). If the consonant is voiced, the voicing is the only sound made during occlusion; if it is voiceless, a stop is completely silent. What we hear as a /p/ or /k/ is the effect that the &quot;onset&quot; of the occlusion has on the preceding vowel, as well as the release burst and its effect on the following vowel. The shape and position of the tongue (the &quot;place&quot; of articulation) determine the resonant cavity that gives different stops their characteristic sounds. All languages have stops.
* Nasal, a nasal occlusive, where there is occlusion of the oral tract, but air passes through the nose. The shape and position of the tongue determine the resonant cavity that gives different nasals their characteristic sounds. Examples include English . Nearly all languages have nasals, the only exceptions being in the area of Puget Sound and a single language on Bougainville Island.
* Fricative, sometimes called spirant, where there is continuous &quot;frication&quot; (turbulent and noisy airflow) at the place of articulation. Examples include English (voiceless), (voiced), etc. Most languages have fricatives, though many have only an . However, the Indigenous Australian languages are almost completely devoid of fricatives of any kind.
** Sibilants are a type of fricative where the airflow is guided by a groove in the tongue toward the teeth, creating a high-pitched and very distinctive sound. These are by far the most common fricatives. Fricatives at coronal (front of tongue) places of articulation are usually, though not always, sibilants. English sibilants include and .
** Lateral fricatives are a rare type of fricative, where the frication occurs on one or both sides of the edge of the tongue. The &quot;ll&quot; of Welsh and the &quot;hl&quot; of Zulu are lateral fricatives.
* Affricate, which begins like a stop, but this releases into a fricative rather than having a separate release of its own. The English letters &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;j&quot; represent affricates. Affricates are quite common around the world, though less common than fricatives.
* Vibrant, where there are one or more brief occlusions, are a class of consonants that comprises trills and flaps.
** Flap, often called a tap, is a momentary closure of the oral cavity. The &quot;tt&quot; of &quot;utter&quot; and the &quot;dd&quot; of &quot;udder&quot; are pronounced as a flap in North American and Australian English. Many linguists distinguish &quot;taps&quot; from &quot;flaps&quot;, but there is no consensus on what the difference might be. No language relies on such a difference. There are also lateral flaps.
** Trill, in which the articulator (usually the tip of the tongue) is held in place, and the airstream causes it to vibrate. The double &quot;r&quot; of Spanish &quot;perro&quot; is a trill.
* Approximant, where there is very little obstruction. Examples include English and . In some languages, such as Spanish, there are sounds that seem to fall between &quot;fricative&quot; and &quot;approximant&quot;.
** One use of the word semivowel, sometimes called a glide, is a type of approximant, pronounced like a vowel but with the tongue closer to the roof of the mouth, so that there is slight turbulence. In English, is the semivowel equivalent of the vowel , and (spelled &quot;y&quot;) is the semivowel equivalent of the vowel in this usage. Other descriptions use &quot;semivowel&quot; for vowel-like sounds that are not syllabic, but do not have the increased stricture of approximants. These are found as elements in diphthongs. The word may also be used to cover both concepts. The term glide is newer than semivowel, being used to indicate an essential quality of sounds such as and , which is the movement (or glide) from their initial position ( and , respectively) to a following vowel.
** Lateral approximants, usually shortened to lateral, are a type of approximant pronounced with the side of the tongue. English is a lateral. Together with the &quot;rhotics&quot;, which have similar behavior in many languages, these form a class of consonant called liquids.

==Other airstream initiations==

All of these manners of articulation are pronounced with an airstream mechanism called pulmonic egressive, meaning that the air flows outward, and is powered by the lungs (actually the ribs and diaphragm). Other airstream mechanisms are possible. Sounds that rely on some of these include:

* Ejectives, which are &quot;glottalic egressive&quot;. That is, the airstream is powered by an upward movement of the glottis rather than by the lungs or diaphragm. Stops, affricates, and occasionally fricatives may occur as ejectives. All ejectives are voiceless, or at least transition from voiced to voiceless.
* Implosives, which are &quot;glottalic ingressive&quot;. Here the glottis moves downward, but the lungs may be used simultaneously (to provide voicing), and in some languages no air may actually flow into the mouth. Implosive stops are not uncommon, but implosive affricates and fricatives are rare. Voiceless implosives are also rare.
* Clicks, which are &quot;lingual ingressive&quot;. Here the back of the tongue is used to create a vacuum in the mouth, causing air to rush in when the forward occlusion (tongue or lips) is released. Clicks may be oral or nasal, stop or affricate, central or lateral, voiced or voiceless. They are extremely rare in normal words outside Southern Africa. However, English has a click in its &quot;tsk tsk&quot; (or &quot;tut tut&quot;) sound, and another is often used to say &quot;giddy up&quot; to a horse.
* Percussives are generated by striking one organ against another. No standalone percussive occurs in any language, but alveolar clicks may have a sublingual percussive release in Sandawe, where after the click is pronounced, the tongue strikes the floor of the mouth.
* Combinations of these, in some analyses, in a single consonant: &quot;linguo-pulmonic&quot; and &quot;linguo-glottalic (ejective)&quot; consonants, which are clicks released into either a pulmonic or ejective stop/fricative.

<text>Mostaganem () is a province (&quot;wilaya&quot;) of Algeria, with a population of 892165 inhabitants in 2019, with a density of 393/square kilometers. Its capital is Mostaganem.

==Geography==
The land relief in Mostaganem Province can be divided into four regions: the Dahra Range to the east, the Mostaganem Plateau to the south, the Chelif River valley which separates the two highland regions, and the plains on the province&#x27;s southern border which lie next to the marshes of the Macta.

The Mostaganem Plateau covers eleven municipalities in the southern part of the province: Mostaganem, Ain Tedles, Sour, Bouguirat, Sirat, Souaflia, Mesra, Ain Sidi Cherif, Mansourah, Touahria and Sayada. It is a semi-arid and sandy plateau, in the shape of a triangle and bounded to the north by the Chelif River. It receives 350 mm of rainfall per year.

During French colonization, viticulture was introduced on the plateau. After the country&#x27;s independence, it was replaced by irrigated market gardening and the culture of citrus fruits and cereals. However, in certain sectors east of Mostaganem, the replacement of the vineyards caused the appearance of small dunes as a consequence of the resumption of soil movement.

==History==
In 1984 Relizane Province was carved out of its territory.

==Administrative divisions==
The province is divided into 10 districts (&quot;daïras&quot;), which are further divided into 32 &quot;communes&quot; or municipalities.

<doc id="19945" wikidata="Q4321" url="?curid=19945" title="Motherboard">
<text>A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, MB, mobo, base board, system board, or, in Apple computers, logic board) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset&#x27;s input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.

&quot;Motherboard&quot; means specifically a PCB with expansion capabilities. As the name suggests, this board is often referred to as the &quot;mother&quot; of all components attached to it, which often include peripherals, interface cards, and daughterboards: sound cards, video cards, network cards, host bus adapters, TV tuner cards, IEEE 1394 cards, and a variety of other custom components.

Similarly, the term &quot;mainboard&quot; describes a device with a single board and no additional expansions or capability, such as controlling boards in laser printers, television sets, washing machines, mobile phones, and other embedded systems with limited expansion abilities.

==History==
Prior to the invention of the microprocessor, the CPU of a digital computer consisted of multiple circuit boards in a card-cage case with components connected by a backplane containing a set of interconnected sockets into which the circuit boards are plugged. In very old designs, copper wires were the discrete connections between card connector pins, but printed circuit boards soon became the standard practice. The central processing unit (CPU), memory, and peripherals were housed on individually printed circuit boards, which were plugged into the backplane.

In older microprocessor-based systems, the CPU and some support circuitry would fit on a single CPU board, with memory and peripherals on additional boards, all plugged into the backplane. The ubiquitous S-100 bus of the 1970s is an example of this type of backplane system.

The most popular computers of the 1980s such as the Apple II and IBM PC had published schematic diagrams and other documentation which permitted rapid reverse engineering and third-party replacement motherboards. Usually intended for building new computers compatible with the exemplars, many motherboards offered additional performance or other features and were used to upgrade the manufacturer&#x27;s original equipment.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, it became economical to move an increasing number of peripheral functions onto the motherboard. In the late 1980s, personal computer motherboards began to include single ICs (also called Super I/O chips) capable of supporting a set of low-speed peripherals: PS/2 keyboard and mouse, floppy disk drive, serial ports, and parallel ports. By the late 1990s, many personal computer motherboards included consumer-grade embedded audio, video, storage, and networking functions without the need for any expansion cards at all; higher-end systems for 3D gaming and computer graphics typically retained only the graphics card as a separate component. Business PCs, workstations, and servers were more likely to need expansion cards, either for more robust functions, or for higher speeds; those systems often had fewer embedded components.

Laptop and notebook computers that were developed in the 1990s integrated the most common peripherals. This even included motherboards with no upgradeable components, a trend that would continue as smaller systems were introduced after the turn of the century (like the tablet computer and the netbook). Memory, processors, network controllers, power source, and storage would be integrated into some systems.

==Design==

A motherboard provides the electrical connections by which the other components of the system communicate. Unlike a backplane, it also contains the central processing unit and hosts other subsystems and devices.

A typical desktop computer has its microprocessor, main memory, and other essential components connected to the motherboard. Other components such as external storage, controllers for video display and sound, and peripheral devices may be attached to the motherboard as plug-in cards or via cables; in modern microcomputers, it is increasingly common to integrate some of these peripherals into the motherboard itself.

An important component of a motherboard is the microprocessor&#x27;s supporting chipset, which provides the supporting interfaces between the CPU and the various buses and external components. This chipset determines, to an extent, the features and capabilities of the motherboard.

Modern motherboards include:
* CPU sockets (or CPU slots) in which one or more microprocessors may be installed. In the case of CPUs in ball grid array packages, such as the VIA Nano and the Goldmont Plus, the CPU is directly soldered to the motherboard.
* Memory slots into which the system&#x27;s main memory is to be installed, typically in the form of DIMM modules containing DRAM chips. Can be DDR3, DDR4, DDR5, or onboard LPDDRx.
* The chipset which forms an interface between the CPU, main memory, and peripheral buses
* Non-volatile memory chips (usually flash memory in modern motherboards) containing the system&#x27;s firmware or BIOS
* The clock generator which produces the system clock signal to synchronize the various components
* Slots for expansion cards (the interface to the system via the buses supported by the chipset)
* Power connectors, which receive electrical power from the computer power supply and distribute it to the CPU, chipset, main memory, and expansion cards. , some graphics cards (e.g. GeForce 8 and Radeon R600) require more power than the motherboard can provide, and thus dedicated connectors have been introduced to attach them directly to the power supply.
* Connectors for hard disk drives, optical disc drives, or solid-state drives, typically SATA and NVMe

Additionally, nearly all motherboards include logic and connectors to support commonly used input devices, such as USB for mouse devices and keyboards. Early personal computers such as the Apple II and IBM PC include only this minimal peripheral support on the motherboard. Occasionally video interface hardware was also integrated into the motherboard; for example, on the Apple II and rarely on IBM-compatible computers such as the IBM PCjr. Additional peripherals such as disk controllers and serial ports were provided as expansion cards.

Given the high thermal design power of high-speed computer CPUs and components, modern motherboards nearly always include heat sinks and mounting points for fans to dissipate excess heat.

===Form factor===

Motherboards are produced in a variety of sizes and shapes called form factors, some of which are specific to individual computer manufacturers. However, the motherboards used in IBM-compatible systems are designed to fit various case sizes. , most desktop computer motherboards use the ATX standard form factor — even those found in Macintosh and Sun computers, which have not been built from commodity components. A case&#x27;s motherboard and power supply unit (PSU) form factor must all match, though some smaller form factor motherboards of the same family will fit larger cases. For example, an ATX case will usually accommodate a microATX motherboard. Laptop computers generally use highly integrated, miniaturized, and customized motherboards. This is one of the reasons that laptop computers are difficult to upgrade and expensive to repair. Often the failure of one laptop component requires the replacement of the entire motherboard, which is usually more expensive than a desktop motherboard.

===CPU sockets===
A CPU socket (central processing unit) or slot is an electrical component that attaches to a printed circuit board (PCB) and is designed to house a CPU (also called a microprocessor). It is a special type of integrated circuit socket designed for very high pin counts. A CPU socket provides many functions, including a physical structure to support the CPU, support for a heat sink, facilitating replacement (as well as reducing cost), and most importantly, forming an electrical interface both with the CPU and the PCB. CPU sockets on the motherboard can most often be found in most desktop and server computers (laptops typically use surface mount CPUs), particularly those based on the Intel x86 architecture. A CPU socket type and motherboard chipset must support the CPU series and speed.

===Integrated peripherals===
With the steadily declining costs and size of integrated circuits, it is now possible to include support for many peripherals on the motherboard. By combining many functions on one PCB, the physical size and total cost of the system may be reduced; highly integrated motherboards are thus especially popular in small form factor and budget computers. The &quot;integrated peripherals&quot; may also be called &quot;onboard devices&quot;.
* Disk controllers for SATA drives, and historical PATA drives
* Historical floppy-disk controller
* Integrated graphics controller supporting 2D and 3D graphics, with VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, and TV output
* Integrated sound card supporting 8-channel (7.1) audio and S/PDIF output
* Ethernet network controller for connection to a LAN and to receive Internet
* USB controller
* Wireless network interface controller
* Bluetooth controller
* Temperature, voltage, and fan-speed sensors that allow software to monitor the health of computer components.
* Other onboard devices, such as PMIC

===Peripheral card slots===
A typical motherboard will have a different number of connections depending on its standard and form factor.

A standard, modern ATX motherboard will typically have two or three PCI-Express x16 connection for a graphics card, one or two legacy PCI slots for various expansion cards, and one or two PCI-E x1 (which has superseded PCI). A standard EATX motherboard will have two to four PCI-E x16 connection for graphics cards, and a varying number of PCI and PCI-E x1 slots. It can sometimes also have a PCI-E x4 slot (will vary between brands and models).

Some motherboards have two or more PCI-E x16 slots, to allow more than 2 monitors without special hardware, or use a special graphics technology called SLI (for Nvidia) and Crossfire (for AMD). These allow 2 to 4 graphics cards to be linked together, to allow better performance in intensive graphical computing tasks, such as gaming, video editing, etc.

In newer motherboards, the M.2 slots are for SSD and/or wireless network interface controller.

===Temperature and reliability===


Motherboards are generally air cooled with heat sinks often mounted on larger chips in modern motherboards. Insufficient or improper cooling can cause damage to the internal components of the computer, or cause it to crash. Passive cooling, or a single fan mounted on the power supply, was sufficient for many desktop computer CPU&#x27;s until the late 1990s; since then, most have required CPU fans mounted on heat sinks, due to rising clock speeds and power consumption. Most motherboards have connectors for additional computer fans and integrated temperature sensors to detect motherboard and CPU temperatures and controllable fan connectors which the BIOS or operating system can use to regulate fan speed. Alternatively computers can use a water cooling system instead of many fans.

Some small form factor computers and home theater PCs designed for quiet and energy-efficient operation boast fan-less designs. This typically requires the use of a low-power CPU, as well as a careful layout of the motherboard and other components to allow for heat sink placement.

A 2003 study found that some spurious computer crashes and general reliability issues, ranging from screen image distortions to I/O read/write errors, can be attributed not to software or peripheral hardware but to aging capacitors on PC motherboards. Ultimately this was shown to be the result of a faulty electrolyte formulation, an issue termed capacitor plague.

Modern motherboards use electrolytic capacitors to filter the DC power distributed around the board. These capacitors age at a temperature-dependent rate, as their water based electrolytes slowly evaporate. This can lead to loss of capacitance and subsequent motherboard malfunctions due to voltage instabilities. While most capacitors are rated for 2000 hours of operation at , their expected design life roughly doubles for every below this. At a lifetime of 3 to 4 years can be expected. However, many manufacturers deliver substandard capacitors, which significantly reduce life expectancy. Inadequate case cooling and elevated temperatures around the CPU socket exacerbate this problem. With top blowers, the motherboard components can be kept under , effectively doubling the motherboard lifetime.

Mid-range and high-end motherboards, on the other hand, use solid capacitors exclusively. For every 10 °C less, their average lifespan is multiplied approximately by three, resulting in a 6-times higher lifetime expectancy at . These capacitors may be rated for 5000, 10000 or 12000 hours of operation at , extending the projected lifetime in comparison with standard solid capacitors.

In desktop PCs and notebook computers, the motherboard cooling and monitoring solutions are usually based on a super I/O chip or an embedded controller.

==Bootstrapping==
Motherboards contain a ROM (and later EPROM, EEPROM, NOR flash) that stores firmware that initializes hardware devices and boots an operating system from a peripheral device. The terms &quot;bootstrapping&quot; and &quot;boot&quot; come from the phrase &quot;lifting yourself by your bootstraps&quot;.

Microcomputers such as the Apple II and IBM PC used ROM chips mounted in sockets on the motherboard. At power-up, the central processor unit would load its program counter with the address of the Boot ROM and start executing instructions from the Boot ROM. These instructions initialized and tested the system hardware, displayed system information on the screen, performed RAM checks, and then attempts to boot an operating system from a peripheral device. If no peripheral device containing an operating system was available, then the computer would perform tasks from other ROM stores or display an error message, depending on the model and design of the computer. For example, both the Apple II and the original IBM PC had Cassette BASIC (ROM BASIC) and would start that if no operating system could be loaded from the floppy disk or hard disk.

The boot firmware in modern IBM PC compatible motherboard designs contains either a BIOS, as did the boot ROM on the original IBM PC, or UEFI. UEFI is a successor to BIOS that became popular after Microsoft began requiring it for a system to be certified to run Windows 8.

When the computer is powered on, the boot firmware tests and configures memory, circuitry, and peripherals. This Power-On Self Test (POST) may include testing some of the following things:
* Video card
* Expansion cards inserted into slots, such as conventional PCI and PCI Express
* Historical floppy drive
* Temperatures, voltages, and fan speeds for hardware monitoring
* CMOS memory used to store BIOS configuration
* Keyboard and mouse
* Sound card
* Network adapter
* Optical drives: CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
* Hard disk drive and solid-state drive
* Security devices, such as a fingerprint reader
* USB devices, such as a USB mass storage device

<doc id="19947" wikidata="Q131808" url="?curid=19947" title="Mannerism">
<text>Mannerism is a style in European art that emerged in the later years of the Italian High Renaissance around 1520, spreading by about 1530 and lasting until about the end of the 16th century in Italy, when the Baroque style largely replaced it. Northern Mannerism continued into the early 17th century.

Mannerism encompasses a variety of approaches influenced by, and reacting to, the harmonious ideals associated with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Vasari, and early Michelangelo. Where High Renaissance art emphasizes proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant. Notable for its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities, this artistic style privileges compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity of earlier Renaissance painting. Mannerism in literature and music is notable for its highly florid style and intellectual sophistication.

The definition of Mannerism and the phases within it continue to be a subject of debate among art historians. For example, some scholars have applied the label to certain early modern forms of literature (especially poetry) and music of the 16th and 17th centuries. The term is also used to refer to some late Gothic painters working in northern Europe from about 1500 to 1530, especially the Antwerp Mannerists—a group unrelated to the Italian movement. Mannerism has also been applied by analogy to the Silver Age of Latin literature.

==Nomenclature==
The word &quot;Mannerism&quot; derives from the Italian &quot;maniera&quot;, meaning &quot;style&quot; or &quot;manner&quot;. Like the English word &quot;style&quot;, &quot;maniera&quot; can either indicate a specific type of style (a beautiful style, an abrasive style) or indicate an absolute that needs no qualification (someone &quot;has style&quot;). In the second edition of his &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot; (1568), Giorgio Vasari used &quot;maniera&quot; in three different contexts: to discuss an artist&#x27;s manner or method of working; to describe a personal or group style, such as the term &quot;maniera greca&quot; to refer to the medieval Italo-Byzantine style or simply to the &quot;maniera&quot; of Michelangelo; and to affirm a positive judgment of artistic quality. Vasari was also a Mannerist artist, and he described the period in which he worked as &quot;la maniera moderna&quot;, or the &quot;modern style&quot;. James V. Mirollo describes how &quot;Bella maniera&quot; poets attempted to surpass in virtuosity the sonnets of Petrarch. This notion of &quot;Bella maniera&quot; suggests that artists who were thus inspired looked to copying and bettering their predecessors, rather than confronting nature directly. In essence, &quot;Bella maniera&quot; utilized the best from several source materials, synthesizing it into something new.

As a stylistic label, &quot;Mannerism&quot; is not easily defined. It was used by Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt and popularized by German art historians in the early 20th century to categorize the seemingly uncategorizable art of the Italian 16th century—art that was no longer found to exhibit the harmonious and rational approaches associated with the High Renaissance. &quot;High Renaissance&quot; connoted a period distinguished by harmony, grandeur, and the revival of classical antiquity. The term &quot;Mannerist&quot; was redefined in 1967 by John Shearman following the exhibition of Mannerist paintings organised by Fritz Grossmann at Manchester City Art Gallery in 1965.

Yet historians differ as to whether Mannerism is a style, a movement, or a period. Some authors have called it the &quot;Late Renaissance&quot;. Although the term remains controversial, it is still commonly used to identify European art and culture in the 16th century.

==Origin and development==
By the end of the High Renaissance, young artists experienced a crisis: It seemed that everything that could be achieved was already achieved. No more difficulties, technical or otherwise, remained to be solved. The detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, physiognomy and how humans register emotion in expression and gesture, the innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, and the use of the subtle gradation of tone, all had reached near perfection. The young artists needed to find a new goal, and they sought new approaches. At this point Mannerism started to emerge. The new style developed between 1510 and 1520 either in Florence, or in Rome, or both cities simultaneously.
===Origins and models===
This period has been described as a &quot;natural extension&quot; of the art of Andrea del Sarto, Michelangelo, and Raphael. Michelangelo developed his style at an early age, a deeply original one that was greatly admired at first, then often copied and imitated by other artists of the era. One of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his &quot;terribilità&quot;, a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur, and subsequent artists attempted to imitate it. Other artists learned Michelangelo&#x27;s impassioned and highly personal style by copying the works of the master, a standard way that students learned to paint and sculpt. His Sistine Chapel ceiling provided examples for them to follow, in particular his representation of collected figures often called &quot;ignudi&quot; and of the Libyan Sibyl, his vestibule to the Laurentian Library, the figures on his Medici tombs, and above all his &quot;Last Judgment&quot;. The later Michelangelo was one of the great models of Mannerism. Young artists broke into his house and stole drawings from him. In his book &quot;Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;, Giorgio Vasari noted that Michelangelo stated once: &quot;Those who are followers can never pass by whom they follow&quot;.

====The competitive spirit====
The competitive spirit was cultivated by patrons who encouraged sponsored artists to emphasize virtuosic technique and to compete with one another for commissions. It drove artists to look for new approaches and dramatically illuminated scenes, elaborate clothes and compositions, elongated proportions, highly stylized poses, and a lack of clear perspective. Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were each given a commission by Gonfaloniere Piero Soderini to decorate a wall in the Hall of Five Hundred in Florence. These two artists were set to paint side by side and compete against each other, fueling the incentive to be as innovative as possible.
===Early mannerism===

The early Mannerists in Florence—especially the students of Andrea del Sarto such as Jacopo da Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino—are notable for elongated forms, precariously balanced poses, a collapsed perspective, irrational settings, and theatrical lighting. Parmigianino (a student of Correggio) and Giulio Romano (Raphael&#x27;s head assistant) were moving in similarly stylized aesthetic directions in Rome. These artists had matured under the influence of the High Renaissance, and their style has been characterized as a reaction to or exaggerated extension of it. Instead of studying nature directly, younger artists began studying Hellenistic sculpture and paintings of masters past. Therefore, this style is often identified as &quot;anti-classical&quot;, yet at the time it was considered a natural progression from the High Renaissance. The earliest experimental phase of Mannerism, known for its &quot;anti-classical&quot; forms, lasted until about 1540 or 1550. Marcia B. Hall, professor of art history at Temple University, notes in her book &quot;After Raphael&quot; that Raphael&#x27;s premature death marked the beginning of Mannerism in Rome.

In past analyses, it has been noted that mannerism arose in the early 16th century contemporaneously with a number of other social, scientific, religious and political movements such as the Copernican heliocentrism, the Sack of Rome in 1527, and the Protestant Reformation&#x27;s increasing challenge to the power of the Catholic Church. Because of this, the style&#x27;s elongated forms and distorted forms were once interpreted as a reaction to the idealized compositions prevalent in High Renaissance art. This explanation for the radical stylistic shift has fallen out of scholarly favor, though early Mannerist art is still sharply contrasted with High Renaissance conventions; the accessibility and balance achieved by Raphael&#x27;s &quot;School of Athens&quot; no longer seemed to interest young artists.

===High maniera===
The second period of Mannerism is commonly differentiated from the earlier, so-called &quot;anti-classical&quot; phase.
Subsequent mannerists stressed intellectual conceits and artistic virtuosity, features that have led later critics to accuse them of working in an unnatural and affected &quot;manner&quot; (&quot;maniera&quot;). Maniera artists looked to their older contemporary Michelangelo as their principal model; theirs was an art imitating art, rather than an art imitating nature. Art historian Sydney Joseph Freedberg argues that the intellectualizing aspect of maniera art involves expecting its audience to notice and appreciate this visual reference—a familiar figure in an unfamiliar setting enclosed between &quot;unseen, but felt, quotation marks&quot;. The height of artifice is the Maniera painter&#x27;s penchant for deliberately misappropriating a quotation. Agnolo Bronzino and Giorgio Vasari exemplify this strain of Maniera that lasted from about 1530 to 1580. Based largely at courts and in intellectual circles around Europe, Maniera art couples exaggerated elegance with exquisite attention to surface and detail: porcelain-skinned figures recline in an even, tempered light, acknowledging the viewer with a cool glance, if they make eye contact at all. The Maniera subject rarely displays much emotion, and for this reason works exemplifying this trend are often called &#x27;cold&#x27; or &#x27;aloof.&#x27; This is typical of the so-called &quot;stylish style&quot; or &quot;Maniera&quot; in its maturity.

==Spread ==
The cities Rome, Florence, and Mantua were Mannerist centers in Italy. Venetian painting pursued a different course, represented by Titian in his long career. A number of the earliest Mannerist artists who had been working in Rome during the 1520s fled the city after the Sack of Rome in 1527. As they spread out across the continent in search of employment, their style was disseminated throughout Italy and Northern Europe. The result was the first international artistic style since the Gothic. Other parts of Northern Europe did not have the advantage of such direct contact with Italian artists, but the Mannerist style made its presence felt through prints and illustrated books. European rulers, among others, purchased Italian works, while northern European artists continued to travel to Italy, helping to spread the Mannerist style. Individual Italian artists working in the North gave birth to a movement known as the Northern Mannerism. Francis I of France, for example, was presented with Bronzino&#x27;s &quot;Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time&quot;. The style waned in Italy after 1580, as a new generation of artists, including the Carracci brothers, Caravaggio and Cigoli, revived naturalism. Walter Friedlaender identified this period as &quot;anti-mannerism&quot;, just as the early Mannerists were &quot;anti-classical&quot; in their reaction away from the aesthetic values of the High Renaissance and today the Carracci brothers and Caravaggio are agreed to have begun the transition to Baroque-style painting which was dominant by 1600.

Outside of Italy, however, Mannerism continued into the 17th century. In France, where Rosso traveled to work for the court at Fontainebleau, it is known as the &quot;Henry II style&quot; and had a particular impact on architecture. Other important continental centers of Northern Mannerism include the court of Rudolf II in Prague, as well as Haarlem and Antwerp. Mannerism as a stylistic category is less frequently applied to English visual and decorative arts, where native labels such as &quot;Elizabethan&quot; and &quot;Jacobean&quot; are more commonly applied. Seventeenth-century Artisan Mannerism is one exception, applied to architecture that relies on pattern books rather than on existing precedents in Continental Europe.

Of particular note is the Flemish influence at Fontainebleau that combined the eroticism of the French style with an early version of the vanitas tradition that would dominate seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish painting. Prevalent at this time was the &quot;pittore vago&quot;, a description of painters from the north who entered the workshops in France and Italy to create a truly international style.

==Sculpture==
As in painting, early Italian Mannerist sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the High Renaissance, which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, next to Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;. Baccio Bandinelli took over the project of &quot;Hercules and Cacus&quot; from the master himself, but it was little more popular then than it is now, and maliciously compared by Benvenuto Cellini to &quot;a sack of melons&quot;, though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the pedestal of statues. Like other works of his and other Mannerists, it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done. Cellini&#x27;s bronze &quot;Perseus with the Head of Medusa&quot; is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, and artificially stylized in comparison with the &quot;David&quot;s of Michelangelo and Donatello. Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel Salt Cellar (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best.

Small bronze figures for collector&#x27;s cabinets, often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which Giambologna, originally Flemish but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century. He also created life-size sculptures, of which two entered the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the &quot;figura serpentinata&quot;, often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.

==Early theorists==
===Giorgio Vasari===
Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s opinions about the art of painting emerge in the praise he bestows on fellow artists in his multi-volume &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot;: he believed that excellence in painting demanded refinement, richness of invention (&quot;invenzione&quot;), expressed through virtuoso technique (&quot;maniera&quot;), and wit and study that appeared in the finished work, all criteria that emphasized the artist&#x27;s intellect and the patron&#x27;s sensibility. The artist was now no longer just a trained member of a local Guild of St Luke. Now he took his place at court alongside scholars, poets, and humanists, in a climate that fostered an appreciation for elegance and complexity. The coat-of-arms of Vasari&#x27;s Medici patrons appears at the top of his portrait, quite as if it were the artist&#x27;s own. The framing of the woodcut image of Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; would be called &quot;Jacobean&quot; in an English-speaking milieu. In it, Michelangelo&#x27;s Medici tombs inspire the anti-architectural &quot;architectural&quot; features at the top, the papery pierced frame, the satyr nudes at the base. As a mere frame it is extravagant: Mannerist, in short..

===Gian Paolo Lomazzo===
Another literary figure from the period is Gian Paolo Lomazzo, who produced two works—one practical and one metaphysical—that helped define the Mannerist artist&#x27;s self-conscious relation to his art. His &quot;Trattato dell&#x27;arte della pittura, scoltura et architettura&quot; (Milan, 1584) is in part a guide to contemporary concepts of decorum, which the Renaissance inherited in part from Antiquity but Mannerism elaborated upon. Lomazzo&#x27;s systematic codification of aesthetics, which typifies the more formalized and academic approaches typical of the later 16th century, emphasized a consonance between the functions of interiors and the kinds of painted and sculpted decors that would be suitable. Iconography, often convoluted and abstruse, is a more prominent element in the Mannerist styles. His less practical and more metaphysical &quot;Idea del tempio della pittura&quot; (&quot;The ideal temple of painting&quot;, Milan, 1590) offers a description along the lines of the &quot;four temperaments&quot; theory of human nature and personality, defining the role of individuality in judgment and artistic invention.

== Characteristics of artworks ==
Mannerism was an anti-classical movement which differed greatly from the aesthetic ideologies of the Renaissance. Though Mannerism was initially accepted with positivity based on the writings of Vasari, it was later regarded in a negative light because it solely view as &quot;an alteration of natural truth and a trite repetition of natural formulas.&quot; As an artistic moment, Mannerism involves many characteristics that are unique and specific to experimentation of how art is perceived. Below is a list of many specific characteristics that Mannerist artists would employ in their artworks.
* Elongation of figures: often Mannerist work featured the elongation of the human figure – occasionally this contributed to the bizarre imagery of some Mannerist art.
* Distortion of perspective: in paintings, the distortion of perspective explored the ideals for creating a perfect space. However, the idea of perfection sometimes alluded to the creation of unique imagery. One way in which distortion was explored was through the technique of foreshortening. At times, when extreme distortion was utilized, it would render the image nearly impossible to decipher.
* Black backgrounds: Mannerist artists often utilized flat black backgrounds to present a full contrast of contours in order to create dramatic scenes. Black backgrounds also contributed to a creating sense of fantasy within the subject matter.
* Use of darkness and light: many Mannerists were interested in capturing the essence of the night sky through the use of intentional illumination, often creating a sense of fantasy scenes. Notably, special attention was paid to torch and moonlight to create dramatic scenes.
* Sculptural forms: Mannerism was greatly influenced by sculpture, which gained popularity in the sixteenth century. As a result, Mannerist artists often based their depictions of human bodies in reference to sculptures and prints. This allowed Mannerist artists to focus on creating dimension.
* Clarity of line: the attention that was paid to clean outlines of figures was prominent within Mannerism and differed largely from the Baroque and High Renaissance.The outlines of figures often allowed for more attention to detail.
*Composition and space: Mannerist artists rejected the ideals of the Renaissance, notably the technique of one-point perspective. Instead, there was an emphasis on atmospheric effects and distortion of perspective. The use of space in Mannerist works instead privileged crowded compositions with various forms and figures or scant compositions with emphasis on black backgrounds.
* Mannerist movement: the interest in the study of human movement often lead to Mannerist artists rendering a unique type of movement linked to serpentine positions. These positions often anticipate the movements of future positions because of their often-unstable motions figures. In addition, this technique attributes to the artist&#x27;s experimentation of form.
* Painted frames: in some Mannerist works, painted frames were utilized to blend in with the background of paintings and at times, contribute to the overall composition of the artwork. This is at times prevalent when there is special attention paid to ornate detailing.
* Atmospheric effects: many Mannerists utilized the technique of sfumato, known as, &quot;the rendering of soft and hazy contours or surfaces&quot; in their paintings for rendering the streaming of light.
* Mannerist colour: a unique aspect of Mannerism was in addition to the experimentation of form, composition, and light, much of the same curiosity was applied to color. Many artworks toyed with pure and intense hues of blues, green, pinks, and yellows, which at times detract from the overall design of artworks, and at other times, complement it. When painting the figure, artists would often emphasize the lightness of complexions and utilize undertones of blue.

==Artists and examples of their work==
===Jacopo da Pontormo===
Jacopo da Pontormo&#x27;s work is one of the most important contributions to Mannerism. He often drew his subject matter from religious narratives; heavily influenced by the works of Michelangelo, he frequently alludes to or uses sculptural forms as models for his compositions. A well-known element of his work is the rendering of gazes by various figures which often pierce out at the viewer in various directions. Dedicated to his work, Pontormo often expressed anxiety about its quality and was known to work slowly and methodically. His legacy is highly regarded, as he influenced artists such as Agnolo Bronzino and the aesthetic ideals of late Mannerism.

Pontormo&#x27;s &quot;Joseph in Egypt&quot;, painted in 1517, portrays a running narrative of four Biblical scenes in which Joseph reconnects with his family. On the left side of the composition, Pontomoro depicts a scene of Joseph introducing his family to the Pharaoh of Egypt. On the right, Joseph is riding on a rolling bench, as cherubs fill the composition around him in addition to other figures and large rocks on a path in the distance. Above these scenes, is a spiral staircase which Joseph guides one his sons to their mother at the top. The final scene, on the right, is the final stage of Jacob&#x27;s death as his sons watch nearby.

Pontormo&#x27;s &quot;Joseph in Egypt&quot; features many Mannerist elements. One element is utilization of incongruous colors such as various shades of pinks and blues which make up a majority of the canvas. An additional element of Mannerism is the incoherent handling of time about the story of Joseph through various scenes and use of space. Through the inclusion of the four different narratives, Ponotormo creates a cluttered composition and overall sense of busyness.

===Rosso Fiorentino and the School of Fontainebleau===
Rosso Fiorentino, who had been a fellow pupil of Pontormo in the studio of Andrea del Sarto, in 1530 brought Florentine Mannerism to Fontainebleau, where he became one of the founders of French 16th-century Mannerism, popularly known as the School of Fontainebleau.

The examples of a rich and hectic decorative style at Fontainebleau further disseminated the Italian style through the medium of engravings to Antwerp, and from there throughout Northern Europe, from London to Poland. Mannerist design was extended to luxury goods like silver and carved furniture. A sense of tense, controlled emotion expressed in elaborate symbolism and allegory, and an ideal of female beauty characterized by elongated proportions are features of this style.

===Agnolo Bronzino===

Agnolo Bronzino was a pupil of Pontormo, whose style was very influential and often confusing in terms of figuring out the attribution of many artworks. During his career, Bronzino also collaborated with Vasari as a set designer for the production &quot;Comedy of Magicians&quot;, where he painted many portraits. Bronzino&#x27;s work was sought after, and he enjoyed great success when he became a court painter for the Medici family in 1539. A unique Mannerist characteristic of Bronzino&#x27;s work was the rendering of milky complexions.

In the painting, &quot;Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time&quot;, Bronzino portrays an erotic scene that leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. In the foreground, Cupid and Venus are nearly engaged in a kiss, but pause as if caught in the act. Above the pair are mythological figures, Father Time on the right, who pulls a curtain to reveal the pair and the representation of the goddess of the night on the left. The composition also involves a grouping of masks, a hybrid creature composed of features of a girl and a serpent, and a man depicted in agonizing pain. Many theories are available for the painting, such as it conveying the dangers of syphilis, or that the painting functioned as a court game.

Mannerist portraits by Bronzino are distinguished by a serene elegance and meticulous attention to detail. As a result, Bronzino&#x27;s sitters have been said to project an aloofness and marked emotional distance from the viewer. There is also a virtuosic concentration on capturing the precise pattern and sheen of rich textiles. Specifically, within the &quot;Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time&quot;, Bronzino utilizes the tactics of Mannerist movement, attention to detail, color, and sculptural forms. Evidence of Mannerist movement is apparent in the awkward movements of Cupid and Venus, as they contort their bodies to partly embrace. Particularly, Bronzino paints the complexion with the many forms as a perfect porcelain white with a smooth effacement of their muscles which provides a reference to the smoothness of sculpture.

===Alessandro Allori===
Alessandro Allori&#x27;s (1535–1607) &quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot; (&quot;below&quot;) is distinguished by latent eroticism and consciously brilliant still life detail, in a crowded, contorted composition.

===Jacopo Tintoretto===

Jacopo Tintoretto has been known for his vastly different contributions to Venetian painting after the legacy of Titian. His work, which differed greatly from his predecessors, had been criticized by Vasari for its, &quot;fantastical, extravagant, bizarre style.&quot; Within his work, Tintoretto adopted Mannerist elements that have distanced him from the classical notion of Venetian painting, as he often created artworks which contained elements of fantasy and retained naturalism. Other unique elements of Tintoretto&#x27;s work include his attention to color through the regular utilization of rough brushstrokes and experimentation with pigment to create illusion.

An artwork that is associated with Mannerist characteristics is the &quot;Last Supper&quot;; it was commissioned by Michele Alabardi for the San Giorgio Maggiore in 1591. In Tintoretto&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot;, the scene is portrayed from the angle of group of people along the right side of the composition. On the left side of the painting, Christ and the Apostles occupy one side of the table and single out Judas. Within the dark space, there are few sources of light; one source is emitted by Christ&#x27;s halo and hanging torch above the table.

In its distinct composition, the &quot;Last Supper&quot; portrays Mannerist characteristics. One characteristic that Tintoretto utilizes is a black background. Though the painting gives some indication of an interior space through the use of perspective, the edges of the composition are mostly shrouded in shadow which provides drama for the central scene of the &quot;Last Supper&quot;. Additionally, Tintoretto utilizes the spotlight effects with light, especially with the halo of Christ and the hanging torch above the table. A third Mannerist characteristic that Tintoretto employs are the atmospheric effects of figures shaped in smoke and float about the composition.

===El Greco===
El Greco attempted to express religious emotion with exaggerated traits. After the realistic depiction of the human form and the mastery of perspective achieved in High Renaissance, some artists started to deliberately distort proportions in disjointed, irrational space for emotional and artistic effect. El Greco still is a deeply original artist. He has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. Key aspects of Mannerism in El Greco include the jarring &quot;acid&quot; palette, elongated and tortured anatomy, irrational perspective and light, and obscure and troubling iconography. El Greco&#x27;s style was a culmination of unique developments based on his Greek heritage and travels to Spain and Italy.

El Greco&#x27;s work reflects a multitude of styles including Byzantine elements as well as the influence of Caravaggio and Parmigianino in addition to Venetian coloring. An important element is his attention to color as he regarded it to be one of the most important aspects of his painting. Over the course of his career, El Greco&#x27;s work remained in high demand as he completed important commissions in locations such as the Colegio de la Encarnación de Madrid.
El Greco&#x27;s unique painting style and connection to Mannerist characteristics is especially prevalent in the work &quot;Laocoön&quot;. Painted in 1610, it depicts the mythological tale of Laocoön, who warned the Trojans about the danger of the wooden horse which was presented by the Greeks as peace offering to the goddess Minerva. As a result, Minerva retaliated in revenge by summoning serpents to kill Laocoön and his two sons. Instead of being set against the backdrop of Troy, El Greco situated the scene near Toledo, Spain in order to &quot;universalize the story by drawing out its relevance for the contemporary world.&quot;

El Greco&#x27;s unique style in &quot;Laocoön&quot; exemplifies many Mannerist characteristics. Prevalent is the elongation of many of the human forms throughout the composition in conjunction with their serpentine movement, which provides a sense of elegance. An additional element of Mannerist style is the atmospheric effects in which El Greco creates a hazy sky and blurring of landscape in the background. 
===Benvenuto Cellini===
Benvenuto Cellini created the &quot;Cellini Salt Cellar&quot; of gold and enamel in 1540 featuring Poseidon and Amphitrite (water and earth) placed in uncomfortable positions and with elongated proportions. It is considered a masterpiece of Mannerist sculpture.
=== Lavinia Fontana ===
Lavinia Fontana (1552–1614) was a Mannerist portraitist often acknowledged to be the first female career artist in Western Europe. She was appointed to be the Portraitist in Ordinary at the Vatican. Her style is characterized as being influenced by the Carracci family of painters by the colors of the Venetian School. She is known for her portraits of noblewomen, and for her depiction of nude figures, which was unusual for a woman of her time.

===Taddeo Zuccaro (or Zuccari)===
Taddeo Zuccaro was born in Sant&#x27;Angelo in Vado, near Urbino, the son of Ottaviano Zuccari, an almost unknown painter. His brother Federico, born around 1540, was also a painter and architect.

===Federico Zuccaro (or Zuccari)===
Federico Zuccaro&#x27;s documented career as a painter began in 1550, when he moved to Rome to work under Taddeo, his elder brother. He went on to complete decorations for Pius IV, and help complete the fresco decorations at the Villa Farnese at Caprarola. Between 1563 and 1565, he was active in Venice with the Grimani family of Santa Maria Formosa. During his Venetian period, he traveled alongside Palladio in Friuli.

===Joachim Wtewael===
Joachim Wtewael (1566–1638) continued to paint in a Northern Mannerist style until the end of his life, ignoring the arrival of the Baroque art, and making him perhaps the last significant Mannerist artist still to be working. His subjects included large scenes with still life in the manner of Pieter Aertsen, and mythological scenes, many small cabinet paintings beautifully executed on copper, and most featuring nudity.

===Giuseppe Arcimboldo===
Giuseppe Arcimboldo is most readily known for his artworks that incorporate still life and portraiture. His style is viewed as Mannerist with the assemblage style of fruits and vegetables in which its composition can be depicted in various ways—right side up and upside down. Arcimboldo&#x27;s artworks have also applied to Mannerism in terms of humor that it conveys to viewers, because it does not hold the same degree of seriousness as Renaissance works. Stylistically, Arcimboldo&#x27;s paintings are known for their attention to nature and concept of a &quot;monstrous appearance&quot;.

One of Arcimboldo&#x27;s paintings which contains various Mannerist characteristics is, &quot;Vertumnus&quot;. Painted against a black background is a portrait of Rudolf II, whose body is composed of various vegetables, flowers, and fruits. The joke of the painting communicates the humor of power which is that Emperor Rudolf II is hiding a dark inner self behind his public image. On the other hand, the serious tone of the painting foreshadows the good fortune that would be prevalent during his reign.

&quot;Vertumnus&quot; contains various Mannerist elements in terms of its composition and message. One element is the flat, black background which Arcimboldo utilizes to emphasize the status and identity of the Emperor, as well as highlighting the fantasy of his reign. In the portrait of Rudolf II, Arcimboldo also strays away from the naturalistic representation of the Renaissance, and explores the construction of composition by rendering him from a jumble of fruits, vegetables, plants and flowers. Another element of Mannerism which the painting portrays is the dual narrative of a joke and serious message; humor wasn&#x27;t normally utilized in Renaissance artworks.

==Architecture==
Mannerist architecture was characterized by visual trickery and unexpected elements that challenged the Renaissance norms. Flemish artists, many of whom had traveled to Italy and were influenced by Mannerist developments there, were responsible for the spread of Mannerist trends into Europe north of the Alps, including into the realm of architecture. During the period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style, and a pioneer at the Laurentian Library, was Michelangelo (1475–1564). He is credited with inventing the giant order, a large pilaster or column that stretches from the bottom to the top of a multi-storey façade. He used this in his design for the Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome. The Herrerian style ( or &quot;arquitectura herreriana&quot;) of architecture was developed in Spain during the last third of the 16th century under the reign of Philip II (1556–1598), and continued in force in the 17th century, but transformed by the Baroque style of the time. It corresponds to the third and final stage of the Spanish Renaissance architecture, which evolved into a progressive purification ornamental, from the initial Plateresque to classical Purism of the second third of the 16th century and total nudity decorative that introduced the Herrerian style.

Prior to the 20th century, the term &quot;Mannerism&quot; had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general, non-judgmental terms. Mannerist architecture has also been used to describe a trend in the 1960s and 1970s that involved breaking the norms of modernist architecture while at the same time recognizing their existence. Defining Mannerism in this context, architect and author Robert Venturi wrote &quot;Mannerism for architecture of our time that acknowledges conventional order rather than original expression but breaks the conventional order to accommodate complexity and contradiction and thereby engages ambiguity unambiguously.&quot;

===Renaissance examples===

An example of Mannerist architecture is the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, in the rugged countryside outside of Rome. The proliferation of engravers during the 16th century spread Mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles.

Dense with ornament of &quot;Roman&quot; detailing, the display doorway at Colditz Castle exemplifies the northern style, characteristically applied as an isolated &quot;set piece&quot; against unpretentious vernacular walling.

From the late 1560s onwards, many buildings in Valletta, the new capital city of Malta, were designed by the architect Girolamo Cassar in the Mannerist style. Such buildings include St. John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral, the Grandmaster&#x27;s Palace and the seven original auberges. Many of Cassar&#x27;s buildings were modified over the years, especially in the Baroque period. However, a few buildings, such as Auberge d&#x27;Aragon and the exterior of St. John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral, retain most of Cassar&#x27;s original Mannerist design.


While many architectural styles explore harmonious ideals, Mannerism wants to take style a step further and explores the aesthetics of hyperbole and exaggeration. Mannerism is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities. Mannerism favours compositional tension and instability rather than balance and clarity. The definition of Mannerism, and the phases within it, continues to be the subject of debate among art historians.

Northern or Antwerp Mannerism predates and is distinct from Italian Mannerism. Antwerp during its 16th-century boom produced a style that was the last phase of Early Netherlandish painting with Early Renaissance elements. Through Antwerp, Renaissance and Mannerist styles were widely introduced in England, Germany, and northern and eastern Europe in general.

==Literature and music==
Literary mannerism involved such figures as Michelangelo, Clément Marot, Giovanni della Casa, Giovanni Battista Guarini, Torquato Tasso, Veronica Franco, Miguel de Cervantes, and others.

In English literature, Mannerism is commonly identified with the qualities of the &quot;Metaphysical poets&quot; of whom the most famous is John Donne. The witty sally of a Baroque writer, John Dryden, against the verse of Donne in the previous generation, affords a concise contrast between Baroque and Mannerist aims in the arts:

The rich musical possibilities in the poetry of the late 16th and early 17th centuries provided an attractive basis for the madrigal, which quickly rose to prominence as the pre-eminent musical form in Italian musical culture, as discussed by Tim Carter:

The word Mannerism has also been used to describe the style of highly florid and contrapuntally complex polyphonic music made in France in the late 14th century. This period is now usually referred to as the &quot;ars subtilior&quot;.

===Mannerism and theatre===
&quot;The Early Commedia dell&#x27;Arte (1550–1621): The Mannerist Context&quot; by Paul Castagno discusses Mannerism&#x27;s effect on the contemporary professional theatre. Castagno&#x27;s was the first study to define a theatrical form as Mannerist, employing the vocabulary of Mannerism and maniera to discuss the typification, exaggerated, and &quot;effetto meraviglioso&quot; of the &quot;comici dell&#x27;arte&quot;. See Part II of the above book for a full discussion of Mannerist characteristics in the commedia dell&#x27;arte. The study is largely iconographic, presenting a pictorial evidence that many of the artists who painted or printed commedia images were in fact, coming from the workshops of the day, heavily ensconced in the maniera tradition.

The preciosity in Jacques Callot&#x27;s minute engravings seem to belie a much larger scale of action. Callot&#x27;s &quot;Balli di Sfessania&quot; () celebrates the commedia&#x27;s blatant eroticism, with protruding phalli, spears posed with the anticipation of a comic ream, and grossly exaggerated masks that mix the bestial with human. The eroticism of the &quot;innamorate&quot; (&quot;lovers&quot;) including the baring of breasts, or excessive veiling, was quite in vogue in the paintings and engravings from the second School of Fontainebleau, particularly those that detect a Franco-Flemish influence. Castagno demonstrates iconographic linkages between genre painting and the figures of the commedia dell&#x27;arte that demonstrate how this theatrical form was embedded within the cultural traditions of the late cinquecento.

====Commedia dell&#x27;arte, &quot;disegno interno&quot;, and the &quot;discordia concors&quot;====
Important corollaries exist between the &quot;disegno interno&quot;, which substituted for the &quot;disegno esterno&quot; (external design) in Mannerist painting. This notion of projecting a deeply subjective view as superseding nature or established principles (perspective, for example), in essence, the emphasis away from the object to its subject, now emphasizing execution, displays of virtuosity, or unique techniques. This inner vision is at the heart of commedia performance. For example, in the moment of improvisation the actor expresses his virtuosity without heed to formal boundaries, decorum, unity, or text. Arlecchino became emblematic of the mannerist &quot;discordia concors&quot; (the union of opposites), at one moment he would be gentle and kind, then, on a dime, become a thief violently acting out with his battle. Arlecchino could be graceful in movement, only in the next beat, to clumsily trip over his feet. Freed from the external rules, the actor celebrated the evanescence of the moment; much the way Benvenuto Cellini would dazzle his patrons by draping his sculptures, unveiling them with lighting effects and a sense of the marvelous. The presentation of the object became as important as the object itself.

==Neo-Mannerism==
In the 20th century, the rise of Neo-Mannerism stemmed from artist Ernie Barnes. The style was heavily influenced by both the Jewish Community, as well as the African-American Community, leading to &quot;The Beauty of the Ghetto&quot; exhibition between 1972 and 1979. The Exhibition toured major American cities, and was hosted by dignitaries, professional athletes, and celebrities. When the exhibition was on view in 1974 at the Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C., Rep. John Conyers stressed the important positive message of the exhibit in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;.

The style of Neo-Mannerism, as developed by Barnes, includes subjects with elongated limbs and bodies, as well as exaggerated movement. Another common theme was closed eyes of the subjects, as a visual representation of &quot;how blind we are to one another&#x27;s humanity&quot;. &quot;We look upon each other and decide immediately: This person is black, so he must be ... This person lives in poverty, so he must be ...&quot;.

===Theatre and cinema===
In an interview, film director Peter Greenaway mentions Federico Fellini and Bill Viola as two major inspirations for his exhaustive and self-referential play with the insoluble tension between the database form of images and the various analogous and digital interfaces that structure them cinematically. This play can be called neo-mannerist precisely insofar as it is distinguished from the (neo-)baroque: &quot;Just as Roman Catholicism would offer you paradise and heaven, there is an equivalent commercial paradise being offered very largely by the whole capitalistic effect, which is associated with Western cinema. This is my political analogy in terms of the use of multimedia as a political weapon. I would equate, in a sense, the great baroque Counter-Reformation, its cultural activity, with what cinema, American cinema predominantly, has been doing in the last seventy years.&quot;

===As a term of criticism===
According to art critic Jerry Saltz, &quot;Neo-Mannerism&quot; (new Mannerism) is among several clichés that are &quot;squeezing the life out of the art world.&quot; Neo-Mannerism describes art of the 21st century that is turned out by students whose academic teachers &quot;have scared [them] into being pleasingly meek, imitative, and ordinary&quot;.
