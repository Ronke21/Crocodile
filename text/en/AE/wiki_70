<text>In geometry, an octahedron (: octahedra or octahedrons) is a polyhedron with eight faces. One special case is the &quot;regular octahedron&quot;, a Platonic solid composed of eight equilateral triangles, four of which meet at each vertex. Regular octahedra occur in nature as crystal structures. Many types of irregular octahedra also exist, including both convex and non-convex shapes.

A regular octahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general concept of a cross-polytope.

== Regular octahedron ==

A regular octahedron is an octahedron that is a regular polyhedron. All the faces of a regular octahedron are equilateral triangles of the same size, and exactly four triangles meet at each vertex. A regular octahedron is convex, meaning that for any two points within it, the line segment connecting them lies entirely within it.

It is one of the eight convex deltahedra because all of the faces are equilateral triangles. It is a composite polyhedron made by attaching two equilateral square pyramids. Its dual polyhedron is the cube, and they have the same three-dimensional symmetry groups, the octahedral symmetry formula_1.

=== As a Platonic solid ===

The regular octahedron is one of the Platonic solids, a set of polyhedrons whose faces are congruent regular polygons and the same number of faces meet at each vertex. This ancient set of polyhedrons was named after Plato who, in his &quot;Timaeus&quot; dialogue, related these solids to nature. One of them, the regular octahedron, represented the classical element of wind.

Following its attribution with nature by Plato, Johannes Kepler in his &quot;Harmonices Mundi&quot; sketched each of the Platonic solids. In his &quot;Mysterium Cosmographicum&quot;, Kepler also proposed the Solar System by using the Platonic solids setting into another one and separating them with six spheres resembling the six planets. The ordered solids started from the innermost to the outermost: regular octahedron, regular icosahedron, regular dodecahedron, regular tetrahedron, and cube.

Like its dual, the regular octahedron has three properties: any two faces, two vertices, and two edges are transformed by rotation and reflection under the symmetry orbit, such that the appearance remains unchanged; these are isohedral, isogonal, and isotoxal respectively. Hence, it is considered a regular polyhedron. Four triangles surround each vertex, so the regular octahedron is formula_2 by vertex configuration or formula_3 by Schläfli symbol.

===As a square bipyramid===

Many octahedra of interest are square bipyramids. A square bipyramid is a bipyramid constructed by attaching two square pyramids base-to-base. These pyramids cover their square bases, so the resulting polyhedron has eight triangular faces.

A square bipyramid is said to be right if the square pyramids are symmetrically regular and both of their apices are on the line passing through the base&#x27;s center; otherwise, it is oblique. The resulting bipyramid has three-dimensional point group of dihedral group formula_4 of sixteen: the appearance is symmetrical by rotating around the axis of symmetry that passing through apices and base&#x27;s center vertically, and it has mirror symmetry relative to any bisector of the base; it is also symmetrical by reflecting it across a horizontal plane. Therefore, this square bipyramid is face-transitive or isohedral.

If the edges of a square bipyramid are all equal in length, then that square bipyramid is a regular octahedron. 

=== Metric properties and Cartesian coordinates ===

The surface area formula_5 of a regular octahedron can be ascertained by summing all of its eight equilateral triangles, whereas its volume formula_6 is twice the volume of a square pyramid; if the edge length is formula_7,
formula_8
The radius of a circumscribed sphere formula_9 (one that touches the octahedron at all vertices), the radius of an inscribed sphere formula_10 (one that tangent to each of the octahedron&#x27;s faces), and the radius of a midsphere formula_11 (one that touches the middle of each edge), are:
formula_12

The dihedral angle of a regular octahedron between two adjacent triangular faces is 109.47°. This can be obtained from the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid: its dihedral angle between two adjacent triangular faces is the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between two adjacent triangular faces, and its dihedral angle between two adjacent triangular faces on the edge in which two equilateral square pyramids are attached is twice the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between its triangular face and its square base.

An octahedron with edge length formula_13 can be placed with its center at the origin and its vertices on the coordinate axes; the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are:
formula_14

=== Graph ===

The skeleton of a regular octahedron can be represented as a graph according to Steinitz&#x27;s theorem, provided the graph is planar—its edges of a graph are connected to every vertex without crossing other edges—and 3-connected graph—its edges remain connected whenever two of more three vertices of a graph are removed. Its graph called the octahedral graph, a Platonic graph.

The octahedral graph can be considered as complete tripartite graph formula_15, a graph partitioned into three independent sets each consisting of two opposite vertices. More generally, it is a Turán graph formula_16.

The octahedral graph is 4-connected, meaning that it takes the removal of four vertices to disconnect the remaining vertices. It is one of only four 4-connected simplicial well-covered polyhedra, meaning that all of the maximal independent sets of its vertices have the same size. The other three polyhedra with this property are the pentagonal dipyramid, the snub disphenoid, and an irregular polyhedron with 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces.

=== Related figures ===

The interior of the compound of two dual tetrahedra is an octahedron, and this compound—called the stella octangula—is its first and only stellation. Correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off from a regular tetrahedron, four regular tetrahedra of half the linear size (i.e. rectifying the tetrahedron). The vertices of the octahedron lie at the midpoints of the edges of the tetrahedron, and in this sense it relates to the tetrahedron in the same way that the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron relate to the other Platonic solids.

One can also divide the edges of an octahedron in the ratio of the golden mean to define the vertices of a regular icosahedron. This is done by first placing vectors along the octahedron&#x27;s edges such that each face is bounded by a cycle, then similarly partitioning each edge into the golden mean along the direction of its vector. Five octahedra define any given icosahedron in this fashion, and together they define a &quot;regular compound&quot;. A regular icosahedron produced this way is called a &quot;snub octahedron&quot;.

The regular octahedron can be considered as the antiprism, a prism like polyhedron in which lateral faces are replaced by alternating equilateral triangles. It is also called &quot;trigonal antiprism&quot;. Therefore, it has the property of quasiregular, a polyhedron in which two different polygonal faces are alternating and meet at a vertex.

Octahedra and tetrahedra can be alternated to form a vertex, edge, and face-uniform tessellation of space. This and the regular tessellation of cubes are the only such uniform honeycombs in 3-dimensional space.

The uniform tetrahemihexahedron is a tetrahedral symmetry faceting of the regular octahedron, sharing edge and vertex arrangement. It has four of the triangular faces, and 3 central squares.

A regular octahedron is a 3-ball in the Manhattan () metric.

=== Characteristic orthoscheme ===
Like all regular convex polytopes, the octahedron can be dissected into an integral number of disjoint orthoschemes, all of the same shape characteristic of the polytope. A polytope&#x27;s characteristic orthoscheme is a fundamental property because the polytope is generated by reflections in the facets of its orthoscheme. The orthoscheme occurs in two chiral forms which are mirror images of each other. The characteristic orthoscheme of a regular polyhedron is a quadrirectangular irregular tetrahedron.

The faces of the octahedron&#x27;s characteristic tetrahedron lie in the octahedron&#x27;s mirror planes of symmetry. The octahedron is unique among the Platonic solids in having an even number of faces meeting at each vertex. Consequently, it is the only member of that group to possess, among its mirror planes, some that do not pass through any of its faces. The octahedron&#x27;s symmetry group is denoted B3. The octahedron and its dual polytope, the cube, have the same symmetry group but different characteristic tetrahedra. 

The characteristic tetrahedron of the regular octahedron can be found by a canonical dissection of the regular octahedron which subdivides it into 48 of these characteristic orthoschemes surrounding the octahedron&#x27;s center. Three left-handed orthoschemes and three right-handed orthoschemes meet in each of the octahedron&#x27;s eight faces, the six orthoschemes collectively forming a trirectangular tetrahedron: a triangular pyramid with the octahedron face as its equilateral base, and its cube-cornered apex at the center of the octahedron.
If the octahedron has edge length 𝒍 = 2, its characteristic tetrahedron&#x27;s six edges have lengths , , around its exterior right-triangle face (the edges opposite the &quot;characteristic angles&quot; 𝟀, 𝝉, 𝟁), plus , , (edges that are the &quot;characteristic radii&quot; of the octahedron). The 3-edge path along orthogonal edges of the orthoscheme is , , , first from an octahedron vertex to an octahedron edge center, then turning 90° to an octahedron face center, then turning 90° to the octahedron center. The orthoscheme has four dissimilar right triangle faces. The exterior face is a 90-60-30 triangle which is one-sixth of an octahedron face. The three faces interior to the octahedron are: a 45-90-45 triangle with edges , , , a right triangle with edges , , , and a right triangle with edges , , .

===Uniform colorings and symmetry===
There are 3 uniform colorings of the octahedron, named by the triangular face colors going around each vertex: 1212, 1112, 1111.

The octahedron&#x27;s symmetry group is Oh, of order 48, the three dimensional hyperoctahedral group. This group&#x27;s subgroups include D3d (order 12), the symmetry group of a triangular antiprism; D4h (order 16), the symmetry group of a square bipyramid; and Td (order 24), the symmetry group of a rectified tetrahedron. These symmetries can be emphasized by different colorings of the faces.
== Other types of octahedra ==

An octahedron can be any polyhedron with eight faces. In a previous example, the regular octahedron has 6 vertices and 12 edges, the minimum for an octahedron; irregular octahedra may have as many as 12 vertices and 18 edges. There are 257 topologically distinct &quot;convex&quot; octahedra, excluding mirror images. More specifically there are 2, 11, 42, 74, 76, 38, 14 for octahedra with 6 to 12 vertices respectively. (Two polyhedra are &quot;topologically distinct&quot; if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.) Some of the polyhedrons do have eight faces aside from being square bipyramids in the following:
* Hexagonal prism: Two faces are parallel regular hexagons; six squares link corresponding pairs of hexagon edges.
* Heptagonal pyramid: One face is a heptagon (usually regular), and the remaining seven faces are triangles (usually isosceles). All triangular faces can&#x27;t be equilateral.
* Truncated tetrahedron: The four faces from the tetrahedron are truncated to become regular hexagons, and there are four more equilateral triangle faces where each tetrahedron vertex was truncated.
* Tetragonal trapezohedron: The eight faces are congruent kites.
* Gyrobifastigium: Two uniform triangular prisms glued over one of their square sides so that no triangle shares an edge with another triangle (Johnson solid 26).
* Truncated triangular trapezohedron, also called Dürer&#x27;s solid: Obtained by truncating two opposite corners of a cube or rhombohedron, this has six pentagon faces and two triangle faces.
* Octagonal hosohedron: degenerate in Euclidean space, but can be realized spherically.
The following polyhedra are combinatorially equivalent to the regular octahedron. They all have six vertices, eight triangular faces, and twelve edges that correspond one-for-one with the features of it:
* Triangular antiprisms: Two faces are equilateral, lie on parallel planes, and have a common axis of symmetry. The other six triangles are isosceles. The regular octahedron is a special case in which the six lateral triangles are also equilateral.
* Tetragonal bipyramids, in which at least one of the equatorial quadrilaterals lies on a plane. The regular octahedron is a special case in which all three quadrilaterals are planar squares.
* Schönhardt polyhedron, a non-convex polyhedron that cannot be partitioned into tetrahedra without introducing new vertices.
* Bricard octahedron, a non-convex self-crossing flexible polyhedron

==Octahedra in the physical world==

===Octahedra in nature===

* Natural crystals of diamond, alum or fluorite are commonly octahedral, as the space-filling tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb.
* The plates of kamacite alloy in octahedrite meteorites are arranged paralleling the eight faces of an octahedron.
* Many metal ions coordinate six ligands in an octahedral or distorted octahedral configuration.
* Widmanstätten patterns in nickel-iron crystals

===Octahedra in art and culture===

* Especially in roleplaying games, this solid is known as a &quot;d8&quot;, one of the more common polyhedral dice.
* If each edge of an octahedron is replaced by a one-ohm resistor, the resistance between opposite vertices is ohm, and that between adjacent vertices ohm.
* Six musical notes can be arranged on the vertices of an octahedron in such a way that each edge represents a consonant dyad and each face represents a consonant triad; see hexany.

===Tetrahedral octet truss===
A space frame of alternating tetrahedra and half-octahedra derived from the Tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb was invented by Buckminster Fuller in the 1950s. It is commonly regarded as the strongest building structure for resisting cantilever stresses.

==Related polyhedra==
A regular octahedron can be augmented into a tetrahedron by adding 4 tetrahedra on alternated faces. Adding tetrahedra to all 8 faces creates the stellated octahedron.
The octahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube.

It is also one of the simplest examples of a hypersimplex, a polytope formed by certain intersections of a hypercube with a hyperplane.

The octahedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular polyhedra with Schläfli symbols {3,&quot;n&quot;}, continuing into the hyperbolic plane.
===Tetratetrahedron===
The regular octahedron can also be considered a &quot;rectified tetrahedron&quot; – and can be called a &quot;tetratetrahedron&quot;. This can be shown by a 2-color face model. With this coloring, the octahedron has tetrahedral symmetry.

Compare this truncation sequence between a tetrahedron and its dual:

The above shapes may also be realized as slices orthogonal to the long diagonal of a tesseract. If this diagonal is oriented vertically with a height of 1, then the first five slices above occur at heights &quot;r&quot;, , , , and &quot;s&quot;, where &quot;r&quot; is any number in the range , and &quot;s&quot; is any number in the range .

The octahedron as a &quot;tetratetrahedron&quot; exists in a sequence of symmetries of quasiregular polyhedra and tilings with vertex configurations (3.&quot;n&quot;)2, progressing from tilings of the sphere to the Euclidean plane and into the hyperbolic plane. With orbifold notation symmetry of *&quot;n&quot;32 all of these tilings are Wythoff constructions within a fundamental domain of symmetry, with generator points at the right angle corner of the domain.
===Trigonal antiprism===
As a trigonal antiprism, the octahedron is related to the hexagonal dihedral symmetry family.


===Other related polyhedra===
Truncation of two opposite vertices results in a square bifrustum.

The octahedron can be generated as the case of a 3D superellipsoid with all exponent values set to 1.

<text>Ole Christensen Rømer (; 25 September 1644 – 19 September 1710) was a Danish astronomer who, in 1676, first demonstrated that light travels at a finite speed. Rømer also invented the modern thermometer showing the temperature between two fixed points, namely the points at which water respectively boils and freezes.

Rømer made his discovery regarding the speed of light while working at the Royal Observatory in Paris and studying Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io. He estimated that light takes about 11 minutes to travel from the Sun to Earth. Using today&#x27;s knowledge of the Sun-Earth distance, this would amount to a speed of light of approximately 220,000 kilometers per second, compared to today&#x27;s accepted value of just under 300,000 kilometers per second.

In scientific literature, alternative spellings such as &quot;Roemer&quot;, &quot;Römer&quot;, or &quot;Romer&quot; are common.

== Biography ==

Rømer was born on 25 September 1644 in Aarhus to merchant and skipper Christen Pedersen (died 1663), and Anna Olufsdatter Storm ( – 1690), daughter of a well-to-do alderman. Since 1642, Christen Pedersen had taken to using the name Rømer, which means that he was from the Danish island of Rømø, to distinguish himself from a couple of other people named Christen Pedersen. There are few records of Ole Rømer before 1662, when he graduated from the old Aarhus Katedralskole (the Cathedral school of Aarhus), moved to Copenhagen and matriculated at the University of Copenhagen. His mentor at the University was Rasmus Bartholin, who published his discovery of the double refraction of a light ray by Iceland spar (a transparent form of the mineral calcite) in 1668, while Rømer was living in his home. Rømer was given every opportunity to learn mathematics and astronomy using Tycho Brahe&#x27;s astronomical observations, as Bartholin had been given the task of preparing them for publication.

Rømer was employed by the French government: Louis XIV made him tutor for the Dauphin, and he also took part in the construction of the magnificent fountains at Versailles.

In 1681, Rømer returned to Denmark and was appointed professor of astronomy at the University of Copenhagen, and the same year he married Anne Marie Bartholin, the daughter of Rasmus Bartholin. He was active also as an observer, both at the University Observatory at Rundetårn and in his home, using improved instruments of his own construction. Unfortunately, his observations have not survived: they were lost in the great Copenhagen Fire of 1728. However, a former assistant (and later an astronomer in his own right), Peder Horrebow, loyally described and wrote about Rømer&#x27;s observations.

In Rømer&#x27;s position as royal mathematician, he introduced the first national system for weights and measures in Denmark on 1 May 1683. Initially based on the Rhine foot, a more accurate national standard was adopted in 1698. Later measurements of the standards fabricated for length and volume show an excellent degree of accuracy. His goal was to achieve a definition based on astronomical constants, using a pendulum. This would happen after his death as practicalities made it too inaccurate at the time. Notable is also his definition of the new Danish mile of 24,000 Danish feet (circa 7,532 m).

In 1700, Rømer persuaded the king to introduce the Gregorian calendar in Denmark and Norway – something Tycho Brahe had argued for in vain a hundred years earlier.
Rømer developed a temperature scale while convalescing from a broken leg. After visiting with Rømer in 1708, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit began making his thermometers using a modified version of Rømer&#x27;s scale that eventually evolved into the Fahrenheit scale still popular in the United States and a few other countries.

Rømer also established navigation schools in several Danish cities.

In 1705, Rømer was made the second Chief of the Copenhagen Police, a position he kept until his death in 1710. As one of his first acts, he fired the entire force, being convinced that the morale was alarmingly low. He was the inventor of the first street lights (oil lamps) in Copenhagen, and worked hard to try to control the beggars, poor people, unemployed, and prostitutes of Copenhagen.

In Copenhagen, Rømer made rules for building new houses, got the city&#x27;s water supply and sewers back in order, ensured that the city&#x27;s fire department got new and better equipment, and was the moving force behind the planning and making of new pavement in the streets and on the city squares.

Rømer died at the age of 65 in 1710. He was buried in Copenhagen Cathedral, which has since been rebuilt following its destruction in the Battle of Copenhagen (1807). There is a modern memorial.

== Rømer and the speed of light ==

The determination of longitude is a significant practical problem in cartography and navigation. Philip III of Spain offered a prize for a method to determine the longitude of a ship out of sight of land, and Galileo proposed a method of establishing the time of day, and thus longitude, based on the times of the eclipses of the moons of Jupiter, in essence using the Jovian system as a cosmic clock; this method was not significantly improved until accurate mechanical clocks were developed in the eighteenth century. Galileo proposed this method to the Spanish crown (1616–1617) but it proved to be impractical, because of the inaccuracies of Galileo&#x27;s timetables and the difficulty of observing the eclipses on a ship. However, with refinements, the method could be made to work on land.

After studies in Copenhagen, Rømer joined Jean Picard in 1671 to observe about 140 eclipses of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io on the island of Hven at the former location of Tycho Brahe’s observatory of Uraniborg, near Copenhagen, over a period of several months, while in Paris Giovanni Domenico Cassini observed the same eclipses. By comparing the times of the eclipses, the difference in longitude of Paris to Uraniborg was calculated.

Cassini had observed the moons of Jupiter between 1666 and 1668, and discovered discrepancies in his measurements that, at first, he attributed to light having a finite speed. In 1672 Rømer went to Paris and continued observing the satellites of Jupiter as Cassini&#x27;s assistant. Rømer added his own observations to Cassini&#x27;s and observed that times between eclipses (particularly those of Io) got shorter as Earth approached Jupiter, and longer as Earth moved farther away. Cassini made an announcement to the Academy of Sciences on 22 August 1676:

&quot;This second inequality appears to be due to light taking some time to reach us from the satellite; light seems to take about ten to eleven minutes [to cross] a distance equal to the half-diameter of the terrestrial orbit&quot;.
Oddly, Cassini seems to have abandoned this reasoning, which Rømer adopted and set about buttressing in an irrefutable manner, using a selected number of observations performed by Picard and himself between 1671 and 1677. Rømer presented his results to the French Academy of Sciences, and it was summarised soon after by an anonymous reporter in a short paper, &quot;&quot;, published 7 December 1676 in the &quot;Journal des sçavans&quot;. Unfortunately, the reporter, possibly in order to hide his lack of understanding, resorted to cryptic phrasing, obfuscating Rømer&#x27;s reasoning in the process. Rømer himself never published his results.

Rømer&#x27;s reasoning was as follows. Referring to the illustration, assume the Earth is at point &quot;L&quot;, and Io emerges from Jupiter&#x27;s shadow at point &quot;D&quot;. After several orbits of Io, at 42.5 hours per orbit, the Earth is at point &quot;K&quot;. If light is not propagated instantaneously, the additional time it takes to reach &quot;K&quot;, which he reckoned about 3½ minutes, would explain the observed delay. Rømer observed &quot;immersions&quot; at point &quot;C&quot; from positions &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, to avoid confusion with eclipses (Io shadowed by Jupiter from &quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot;) and occultations (Io hidden behind Jupiter at various angles). In the table below, his observations in 1676, including the one on 7 August, believed to be at the opposition point &quot;H&quot;, and the one observed at Paris Observatory to be 10 minutes late, on 9 November.

By trial and error, during eight years of observations Rømer worked out how to account for &quot;the retardation of light&quot; when reckoning the ephemeris of Io. He calculated the delay as a proportion of the angle corresponding to a given Earth&#x27;s position with respect to Jupiter, &quot;Δt&quot; = 22·()[minutes]. When the angle α is 180° the delay becomes 22 minutes, which may be interpreted as the time necessary for the light to cross a distance equal to the diameter of the Earth&#x27;s orbit, H to E. (Actually, Jupiter is not visible from the conjunction point E.) That interpretation makes it possible to calculate the strict result of Rømer&#x27;s observations: The ratio of the speed of light to the speed with which Earth orbits the sun, which is the ratio of
the duration of a year divided by pi as compared to the 22 minutes

 ≈ 7,600.

In comparison, the modern value is circa ≈ 10,100.

Rømer neither calculated this ratio, nor did he give a value for the speed of light. However, many others calculated a speed from his data, the first being Christiaan Huygens; after corresponding with Rømer and eliciting more data, Huygens deduced that light travelled Earth diameters per second, which is approximately 212,000 km/s.

Rømer&#x27;s view that the velocity of light was finite was not fully accepted until measurements of the so-called aberration of light were made by James Bradley in 1727.

In 1809, again making use of observations of Io, but this time with the benefit of more than a century of increasingly precise observations, the astronomer Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre reported the time for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth as 8 minutes and 12 seconds. Depending on the value assumed for the astronomical unit, this yields the speed of light as just a little more than 300,000 kilometres per second. The modern value is 8 minutes and 19 seconds, and a speed of 299,792.458 km/s.

A plaque at the Observatory of Paris, where the Danish astronomer happened to be working, commemorates what was, in effect, the first measurement of a universal quantity made on this planet.

== Inventions ==
In addition to inventing the first street lights in Copenhagen, Rømer also invented the meridian circle, the altazimuth, and the passage instrument (also known as the &quot;transit instrument&quot;, a type of meridian circle whose horizontal axis is not fixed in the east-west direction).

== Ole Rømer Medal ==
The is given annually by the Danish Natural Science Research Council for outstanding research.

== The Ole Rømer Museum ==
The Ole Rømer Museum is located in the municipality of Høje-Taastrup, Denmark, at the excavated site of Rømer&#x27;s observatory &quot;&quot; at Vridsløsemagle. The observatory opened in 1704, and operated until about 1716, when the remaining instruments were moved to Rundetårn in Copenhagen. There is a large collection of ancient and more recent astronomical instruments on display at the museum. The museum opened in 1979, and has since 2002 been a part of the museum Kroppedal at the same location.

== Honours ==
In Denmark, Ole Rømer has been honoured in various ways through the ages. He has been portrayed on bank notes, the eponymous is named after him, as are streets in both Aarhus and Copenhagen (&quot;Ole Rømers Gade&quot; and &#x27; respectively). Aarhus University&#x27;s astronomical observatory is named The Ole Rømer Observatory (&#x27;) in his honour, and a Danish satellite project to measure the age, temperature, physical and chemical conditions of selected stars, was named . The satellite project stranded in 2002 and was never realised though.

The Römer crater on the Moon is named after him.

=== In popular culture ===
In the 1960s, the comic-book superhero The Flash on a number of occasions would measure his velocity in &quot;Roemers&quot; , in honour of Ole Rømer&#x27;s &quot;discovery&quot; of the speed of light.

In Larry Niven&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;Rainbow Mars&quot;, Ole Rømer is mentioned as having observed Martian life in an alternate history timeline.

Ole Rømer features in the 2012 game &quot;&quot; as a gentleman under Denmark.

On 7 December 2016, a Google Doodle was dedicated to Rømer.

<text>The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice, often shortened to Othello (), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare around 1603. Set in Venice and Cyprus, the play depicts the Moorish military commander Othello as he is manipulated by his ensign, Iago, into suspecting his wife Desdemona of infidelity. &quot;Othello&quot; is widely considered one of Shakespeare&#x27;s greatest works and is usually classified among his major tragedies alongside &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot;, and &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Unpublished in the author&#x27;s life, the play survives in one quarto edition from 1622 and in the First Folio.

&quot;Othello&quot; has been one of Shakespeare&#x27;s most popular plays, both among playgoers and literary critics, since its first performance, spawning numerous stage, screen, and operatic adaptations. Among actors, the roles of Othello, Iago, Desdemona, and Emilia (Iago&#x27;s wife) are regarded as highly demanding and desirable. Critical attention has focused on the nature of the play&#x27;s tragedy, its unusual mechanics, its treatment of race, and on the motivations of Iago and his relationship to Othello. Originally performed by white actors in dark makeup, the role of Othello began to be played by black actors in the 19th century.

Shakespeare&#x27;s major source for the play was a novella by Cinthio, the plot of which Shakespeare borrowed and reworked substantially. Though not among Shakespeare&#x27;s longest plays, it contains two of his four longest roles in Othello and Iago.

==Characters==

* Othello – General in the Venetian military, a noble Moor
* Desdemona – Othello&#x27;s wife; daughter of Brabantio

* Emilia – Iago&#x27;s wife and Desdemona&#x27;s maidservant
* Bianca – Cassio&#x27;s lover
* Brabantio – Venetian senator and Desdemona&#x27;s father (can also be called Brabanzio)
* Roderigo – dissolute Venetian, in love with Desdemona
* Duke of Venice
* Gratiano – Brabantio&#x27;s brother
* Lodovico – Brabantio&#x27;s kinsman and Desdemona&#x27;s cousin
* Montano – Othello&#x27;s Venetian predecessor in the government of Cyprus
* Clown – servant
* Senators
* Sailor
* Officers, Gentlemen, Messenger, Herald, Attendants, Musicians, etc.
==Plot==

===Act I===
Roderigo, a wealthy and dissolute gentleman, complains to his friend Iago, an ensign, that Iago has not told him about the recent secret marriage between Desdemona, the daughter of Brabantio, a senator, and Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army. Roderigo is upset because he loves Desdemona and had asked her father, Brabantio, for her hand in marriage, which Brabantio denied him.

Iago hates Othello for promoting an aristocrat named Cassio above him, whom Iago considers a less capable soldier than himself. Iago tells Roderigo that he plans to exploit Othello for his own advantage and convinces Roderigo to wake Brabantio and tell him about his daughter&#x27;s elopement. Meanwhile, Iago sneaks away to find Othello and warns him that Brabantio is coming for him.

Brabantio, provoked by Roderigo, is enraged and seeks to confront Othello, but he finds Othello accompanied by the Duke of Venice&#x27;s guards, who prevent violence. News has arrived in Venice that the Turks are going to attack Cyprus, and Othello is therefore summoned to advise the senators. Brabantio has no option but to accompany Othello to the Duke&#x27;s residence, where he accuses Othello of seducing Desdemona by witchcraft.

Othello defends himself before the Duke of Venice, Brabantio&#x27;s kinsmen Lodovico and Gratiano, and various senators. Othello explains that, while he was invited to Brabantio&#x27;s home, Desdemona became enamoured of him for the sad and compelling stories he told of his life before Venice, not because of any witchcraft. The senate is satisfied once Desdemona confirms that she loves Othello, but Brabantio leaves, saying that Desdemona will betray Othello: &quot;Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see. She has deceived her father, and may thee&quot; (Act I, Sc 3). Iago, still in the room, takes note of Brabantio&#x27;s remark. By order of the Duke, Othello leaves Venice to command the Venetian armies against invading Turks on the island of Cyprus, accompanied by his new wife, his new lieutenant Cassio, his ensign Iago, and Iago&#x27;s wife, Emilia, as Desdemona&#x27;s attendant.

===Act II===
The party arrives in Cyprus to find that a storm has destroyed the Turkish fleet. Othello orders a general celebration and leaves to consummate his marriage with Desdemona. In his absence, Iago gets Cassio drunk and then persuades Roderigo to draw Cassio into a fight. Montano tries to calm down an angry and drunk Cassio. This leads to their fighting one another and Montano&#x27;s being injured. Othello arrives and questions the men as to what happened. Othello blames Cassio for the disturbance and strips him of his rank. Cassio, distraught, is then persuaded by Iago to ask Desdemona to persuade her husband to reinstate him.

===Act III===
Iago persuades Othello to be suspicious of Cassio and Desdemona&#x27;s relationship. When Desdemona drops a handkerchief (the first gift given to her by Othello), Emilia finds it and gives it to Iago at his request, unaware of what he plans to do with it. Othello appears and, then being convinced by Iago of his wife&#x27;s unfaithfulness with his captain, vows with Iago for the death of Desdemona and Cassio, after which he makes Iago his lieutenant.

===Act IV===
Iago plants the handkerchief in Cassio&#x27;s lodgings, then tells Othello to watch Cassio&#x27;s reactions while Iago questions him. Iago goads Cassio on to talk about his affair with Bianca, a local courtesan, but whispers her name so quietly that Othello believes the two men are talking about Desdemona. Later, Bianca accuses Cassio of giving her a second-hand gift which he had received from another lover. Othello sees this, and Iago convinces him that Cassio received the handkerchief from Desdemona.

Enraged and hurt, Othello resolves to kill his wife and tells Iago to kill Cassio. Othello proceeds to make Desdemona&#x27;s life miserable and strikes her in front of visiting Venetian nobles. Meanwhile, Roderigo complains that he has received no results from Iago in return for his money and efforts to win Desdemona, but Iago convinces him to kill Cassio.

===Act V===

Roderigo unsuccessfully attacks Cassio in the street after Cassio leaves Bianca&#x27;s lodgings, as Cassio wounds Roderigo. During the scuffle, Iago comes from behind Cassio and badly cuts his leg. In the darkness, Iago manages to hide his identity, and when Lodovico and Gratiano hear Cassio&#x27;s cries for help, Iago joins them. When Cassio identifies Roderigo as one of his attackers, Iago secretly stabs Roderigo to death to stop him from revealing the plot. Iago then accuses Bianca of the failed conspiracy to kill Cassio.

Othello confronts a sleeping Desdemona. She denies being unfaithful, but he smothers her. Emilia arrives, and Desdemona defends her husband before dying, and Othello accuses Desdemona of adultery. Emilia calls for help. The former governor Montano arrives with Gratiano and Iago. When Othello mentions the handkerchief as proof, Emilia realizes what Iago has done, and she exposes him. Othello, belatedly realising Desdemona&#x27;s innocence, stabs Iago (but not fatally), saying that Iago is a devil, but not before the latter stabs Emilia to death in the scuffle.

Iago refuses to explain his motives, vowing to remain silent from that moment on. Lodovico apprehends both Iago and Othello for the murders of Roderigo, Emilia, and Desdemona, but Othello commits suicide. Lodovico appoints Cassio as Othello&#x27;s successor and exhorts him to punish Iago justly. He then denounces Iago for his actions and leaves to tell the others what has happened.

==Date and sources==

===Shakespeare&#x27;s sources===
Shakespeare&#x27;s primary source for the plot was the story of a Moorish Captain (third decade, story seven) in &quot;Gli Hecatommithi&quot; by Cinthio (Giovanni Battista Giraldi), a collection of one hundred novellas about love, grouped into ten &quot;decades&quot; by theme. The third decade deals with marital infidelity. Of Cinthio&#x27;s characters, only Disdemona (the equivalent of Shakespeare&#x27;s Desdemona – her name means &quot;ill-omened&quot; in Italian) is named – the others are simply called the Moor (the equivalent of Othello), the Ensign (Iago), the Corporal (Cassio) and similar descriptions. In its story the Ensign falls in love with the Moor&#x27;s wife Disdemona, but her indifference turns his love to hate and in revenge he persuades the Moor that Disdemona has been unfaithful. The Moor and the Ensign murder Disdemona with socks filled with sand, and bring down the ceiling of her bedchamber to make it appear an accident. The story continues until the Ensign is tortured to death for unrelated reasons and the Moor is killed by Disdemona&#x27;s family.

Shakespeare&#x27;s direct sources for the story do not include any threat of warfare: it seems to have been Shakespeare&#x27;s innovation to set the story at the time of a threatened Turkish invasion of Cyprus—apparently fixing it in the events of 1570. Those historical events would however have been well known to Shakespeare&#x27;s original audience, who would therefore have been aware that—contrary to the action of the play—the Turks took Cyprus, and still held it.

Scholars have identified many other influences on &quot;Othello&quot;: things which are not themselves sources but whose impact on Shakespeare can be identified in the play: these include Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, both &quot;The Merchant&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot; from Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, Geoffrey Fenton&#x27;s &quot;Certaine Tragicall Discourses&quot;, Kyd&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot;, George Peele&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Alcazar&quot;, the anonymous &quot;Arden of Faversham&quot;, Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, and Heywood&#x27;s &quot;A Woman Killed with Kindness&quot;. These also include Shakespeare&#x27;s own earlier plays &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, in which a similar plot was used in a comedy, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; with its high-born, Moorish, Prince of Morocco, and &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, in which a Moor, Aaron, was a prominent villain, and as such was a forerunner of both Othello and Iago.

One such influence is not a literary work at all. In 1600, London was visited for &quot;half a year&quot; by the Moorish ambassador of the King of Barbary, whose entourage caused a stir in the city. Shakespeare&#x27;s company is known to have played at court during the time of the visit, and so would have encountered the foreign visitors at first hand.

Among Shakespeare&#x27;s non-fiction, or partly-fictionalised, sources were Gasparo Contarini&#x27;s &quot;Commonwealth and Government of Venice&quot; and Leo Africanus&#x27;s &quot;A Geographical Historie of Africa&quot;. Himself a Moor from Barbary, Leo said of his own people &quot;they are so credulous they will beleeue matters impossible, which are told them&quot; and &quot;no nation in the world is so subject vnto iealousie; for they will rather [lose] their liues than put vp any disgrace in the behalfe of their women&quot;—both traits seen in Shakespeare&#x27;s Othello. And from Leo&#x27;s own life story Shakespeare took a well-born, educated African finding a place at the height of a white European power. From Philemon Holland&#x27;s translation of Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; Shakespeare took the references to the Pontic Sea, to Arabian trees with their medicinable gum, and to the &quot;Anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders&quot;, elements which also featured in the fantastic &quot;The Travels of Sir John Mandeville&quot;.

===Date===

The &quot;terminus ad quem&quot; for &quot;Othello&quot; (that is, the latest year in which the play could have been written) is 1604, since a performance of the play in that year is mentioned in the accounts book of Sir Edmund Tilney, then Master of the Revels.

A &quot;terminus a quo&quot; (i.e. the earliest year in which it could have been written) is given by the fact that one of its sources, Holland&#x27;s translation of Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, was published in 1601.

Within this range, scholars have tended to date the play 1603–1604, within the reign of James I, since the play appears to have elements designed to appeal to the new king, who had written a poem about the defeat of the Turkish navy at Lepanto, and to the new queen, Anne of Denmark, in whose circle there was an interest in the blackface exoticism also reflected in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Masque of Blackness&quot;, in which the queen and her ladies appeared as &quot;daughters of Niger&quot;. That dating is supported by similarities to &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, another of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays often dated around 1604, and which, like &quot;Othello&quot;, draws its plot from Cinthio&#x27;s &quot;Gli Hecatommithi&quot;. This date is also supported by the possibility that Shakespeare may have consulted Richard Knolles&#x27; 1603 &quot;The Generall Historie of the Turkes&quot;.

However, evidence of an earlier date, 1601–1602, is provided by the so-called bad quarto of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;, published in 1603. The theory is that the bad quarto is a memorial reconstruction of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, made by some of its actors: so where there are unintentional echoes of &quot;Othello&quot; in the bad quarto (for example &quot;to my vnfolding / Lend thy listning eare&quot; in the bad quarto and &quot;To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear&quot; in &quot;Othello&quot;—and a number of others) it suggests that the actors must have been performing &quot;Othello&quot;, at the latest, in the season preceding the bad quarto&#x27;s publication.

===Early editions===
&quot;Othello&quot; was not published in Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime. The first published version of the play was a quarto in 1622 (usually abbreviated to &quot;Q&quot;), which was followed a year later by the play&#x27;s appearance in the &quot;First Folio&quot; (usually abbreviated to &quot;F&quot;).

There are significant differences between the two early editions, the most prominent of which are:
*F contains about 160 lines which are not in Q, sometimes in passages which are quite extended and well-known, such as Othello&#x27;s &quot;Pontic Sea&quot; speech and Desdemona&#x27;s &quot;Willow Song&quot;.
*Q has fuller and more elaborate stage directions than F.
*Q has 63 oaths or profanities which do not appear in F, suggesting the possibility that F was based on a manuscript which had been edited to conform with the 1606 Act of Abuses.
*There are over a thousand variations in wording, lineation, spelling and punctuation.

There is no scholarly consensus to account for the differences between Q and F:
*E. K. Chambers in 1930 argued that Q derived from a scribal manuscript, and F from the author&#x27;s holograph.
*Alice Walker in 1952 argued that F was printed from a corrected copy of Q.
*W. W. Greg in 1955 argued that Q&#x27;s copy must have been a difficult-to-read transcript of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;foul papers&quot; (i.e. first drafts).
*M. R. Ridley in 1958, rejecting Walker&#x27;s argument and accepting Greg&#x27;s, argued that Q had greater authority and rejected F&#x27;s changes as &quot;memorial contamination&quot; from a theatre prompt book or as &quot;sophistications&quot; by the editors of F.
*Nevill Coghill in 1964 argued that the changes in F were improvements made by the author, who might have taken advantage of the need to revise the play in consequence of the Act of Abuses to make other changes.
*Gary Taylor in 1983 agreed with Coghill that F incorporated the author&#x27;s own improvements to Q, but argued that another scribal hand had also made intervening changes to F.
*E. A. J. Honigmann in 1996 partly revived Walker&#x27;s theory, by arguing that the scribe responsible for preparing the manuscript for F had consulted Q whenever the copy was illegible. He also argues that sequences in F but not in Q, such as the &quot;Willow Song&quot;, may have been cuts from the original made for the manuscript of Q, rather than later additions made for the manuscript of F.

As the Oxford Shakespeare editor Michael Neill summarises things: &quot;The textual mystery of &quot;Othello&quot; is unlikely ever to be resolved to general satisfaction.&quot;

==Themes and critical approaches==
===Jealousy===

The influential early twentieth-century Shakespeare critic A. C. Bradley defined Othello&#x27;s tragic flaw as a sexual jealousy so intense that it &quot;converts human nature into chaos, and liberates the beast in man ... the animal in man forcing itself into his consciousness in naked grossness, and he writhing before it but powerless to deny it entrance, grasping inarticulate images of pollution, and finding relief only in a bestial thirst for blood.&quot;

This jealousy is symbolized in the play through animal imagery. In the early acts of the play it is Iago who mentions ass, daws, flies, ram, jennet, guinea-hen, baboon, wild-cat, snipe, monkeys, monster and wolves. But from the third act onwards Othello catches this line of imagery from Iago as his irrational jealousy takes hold. The same occurs with &quot;diabolical&quot; imagery (i.e. images of hell and devils) of which Iago uses 14 of his 16 diabolical images in the first two acts, yet Othello uses 25 of his 26 in the last three acts.

Not only Othello, but also Iago is consumed by jealousy: his is a kind of envy, which contemporary scholar Francis Bacon called &quot;the vilest affection, and the most depraved; for which cause, it is the proper attribute of the Devil... As it always cometh to pass, that envy worketh subtilly, and in the dark; and to the prejudice of good things.&quot;

Sometimes critics have struggled to define the kind of jealousy Othello suffers, or to deny it as a motive (for example, those who claim that in Russia between 1945 and 1957 only one actor portrayed Othello as obsessed by jealousy). In fact jealousy is a wide-ranging emotion and encompasses the spectrum from lust to spiritual disillusionment within which Othello&#x27;s obsession must fall. And he displays many accepted aspects of jealousy: an eagerness to snatch at proofs, indulging degrading images of the jealousy&#x27;s object, snatching at ambiguities to ease the mind, dread of vulgar ridicule, and a spirit of vindictiveness.

Ultimately, Othello becomes persuaded that his honour is tarnished by his wife&#x27;s unfaithfulness and can only be restored through Desdemona&#x27;s and Cassio&#x27;s deaths. And this—a code of behaviour no longer considered valid—is one reason why modern critics rarely regard &quot;Othello&quot; among Shakespeare&#x27;s greatest tragedies.

=== Race ===
As Ben Okri has said:
Or, as the Oxford editor Professor Michael Neill summarises it: 
In plot terms, Othello&#x27;s race serves to mark him as &quot;other&quot;. As both a Christian and a black African, Othello is (as scholar Tom McAlindon puts it) both of, and not of, Venice. And actor Paul Robeson considered Othello&#x27;s colour as essentially secondary, as a way of emphasizing his cultural difference and consequent vulnerability in a society he does not fully understand.

In the world of the play itself, Jyotsna Singh argues that Brabantio&#x27;s—and others&#x27;—objection to Othello, a decorated and respected general, as a suitable husband for Desdemona, a senator&#x27;s daughter, only makes sense in racist terms: reinforced by the bestial imagery used by Iago in delivering the news. The racist slurs used by Iago, Roderigo and Brabantio in the play suggest that Shakespeare conceived of Othello as a black African: &quot;thicklips&quot;; &quot;an old black ram is tupping your white ewe&quot;; &quot;you&#x27;ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse&quot;; &quot;the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou&quot;—as do things Othello says of himself: &quot;haply for I am black&quot;; or &quot;begrimed and black as mine own face&quot;.

There is critical divide over Othello&#x27;s ethnic origin. A &quot;Moor&quot; broadly refers to someone from northwest Africa, especially if Muslim, but in Shakespeare&#x27;s England &quot;Moor&quot; was used with broader connotations: sometimes referring to Africans of all regions, sometimes to Arabic or Islamic peoples beyond Africa, such as those of Turkey and the Middle East, and sometimes to Muslims of any race or location.

===Racism===
In Shakespeare&#x27;s main source, Cinthio&#x27;s &quot;Gli Hecatommithi&quot;, the character Disdemona (the equivalent of Shakespeare&#x27;s Desdemona) says &quot;I know not what to say of the Moor; he used to be all love towards me; but within these few days he has become another man; and much I fear that I shall prove a warning to young girls not to marry against the wishes of their parents, and that the Italian ladies may learn from me not to wed a man whose nature and habitude of life estrange from us&quot;.

Similar wording was used in one of the earliest, and most negative, critiques of the play: Thomas Rymer writing in his 1693 &quot;A Short View of Tragedy&quot; suggested that one of the play&#x27;s morals was &quot;a caution to all Maidens of Quality how, without their Parents consent, they run away with Blackamoors.&quot; Rymer, however, dryly observed that another such moral might be &quot;a warning to all good Wives, that they look well to their Linnen&quot; – as such his comments should be read within the context of his overarching criticism of the play, as unrealistic and lacking in obvious moral conclusions.

In the nineteenth century, such well-known writers as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Lamb questioned whether the play could even be called a &quot;true tragedy&quot; when it dramatized the inviolable taboo of a white woman in a relationship with a black man. Coleridge, writing in 1818, argued that Othello could not have been conceived as black:
&quot;Can we imagine [Shakespeare] so utterly ignorant as to make a barbarous negro plead royal birth—at a time, too, when negroes were not known except as slaves? ... and most surely as an English audience was disposed at the beginning of the seventeenth century, it would be something monstrous to conceive this beautiful Venetian girl falling in love with a veritable negro. It would argue a disproportionateness, a want of balance, in Desdemona, which Shakespeare does not appear to have in the least contemplated.&quot;

These sentiments were instrumental in ushering in the so-called &quot;bronze age of Othello&quot; (discussed further under &quot;19th century&quot; below).

Martin Orkin&#x27;s 1987 essay &quot;Othello and the &quot;Plain Face&quot; of Racism&quot; acknowledges the racist sentiments in the play; but vindicates Shakespeare who confines these views to discredited characters such as Iago, Roderigo and Brabantio. He concludes that &quot;in its fine scrutiny of the mechanisms underlying Iago&#x27;s use of racism, and in its rejection of human pigmentation as a means of identifying human worth, the play, as it always has done, continues to oppose racism.&quot;

The critical approach to racial issues in the play changed direction with the publication in 1996 by Howard University Press of &quot;Othello: New Essays by Black Writers&quot; edited by Mythili Kaul, which made clear that black readers and audience members may be experiencing a different play from white ones. Questions about whether &quot;Othello&quot; is among Shakespeare&#x27;s greatest plays are rendered irrelevant in the context of discussions about how the play illuminates the racial thinking of Shakespeare&#x27;s time, and of the present day.

The Nigerian poet Ben Okri in his 1997 &quot;A Way of Being Free&quot; included several &quot;meditations&quot; on &quot;Othello&quot;, arguing that because &quot;it is possible that Othello actually is a blackened white man&quot; he is not a fully formed character with a psychology but a &quot;white myth or stereotype of black masculinity&quot;. Even with that knowledge, Okri writes, &quot;The black person&#x27;s response to &quot;Othello&quot; is more secret, and much more anguished, than can be imagined. It makes you unbearably lonely to know that you can empathise with [white people], but they will rarely empathise with you. It hurts to watch &quot;Othello&quot;.&quot;

From the 1980s, Othello became a role that only black actors performed. However, in 1998 black actor Hugh Quarshie questioned whether the central role in &quot;Othello&quot; should be played by a black actor, saying:

Scholar Virginia Vaughan made a related point in 2005:

===Patriarchy===
At Brabantio&#x27;s first appearance towards the end of the first scene, he asks whether sinister &quot;charms&quot; may have abused &quot;the property of youth and maidenhood&quot; of Desdemona. For him, Desdemona denying her father&#x27;s right to choose her husband, and choosing a black man for herself, can only be explained by black magic.

The notion of women as property pervades the play. Even after her death, Othello says of Desdemona: &quot;Had she been true, / If heaven would make me such another world / Of one entire and perfect chrysolite, / I&#x27;d not have sold her for it.&quot; Also pervasive is the male fear of female sexuality.

The word &quot;whore&quot; appears 14 times in &quot;Othello&quot;, more often than in any other work by Shakespeare, often used (in Kay Stanton&#x27;s words) as a &quot;male-initiated inscription onto the female as scapegoat.&quot; And it is one of only two of the plays (alongside &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;) in which the word &quot;whore&quot; is used with specific reference to every named female character. In the world of the play, &quot;whorishness&quot; is understood as the true and essential nature of women—yet this is constantly shown to be a projection of male imaginations, completely unrelated to the women&#x27;s perceptions of themselves or to their behavior.
Towards the end of the play, Desdemona&#x27;s goodness increasingly becomes represented by long-suffering martyrdom, perceived as a longstanding sign of acceptable femininity. In place of the headstrong heroine of the opening acts, Desdemona, increasingly stripped of agency, endures her husband&#x27;s anger and humiliations—even his striking her in public—and eventually, while dying, tries to exonerate him for his murder of her. Others perceive Desdemona&#x27;s reaction as one of strength and dignity, not passivity.

In contrast, Emilia (&quot;the only real grown-up in the play&quot;, in the words of stage director Michael Attenborough) revolts against misogyny, defying her husband Iago&#x27;s demands three times in the final scene.

===The handkerchief===
The over-reliance of the plot of &quot;Othello&quot; upon a trivial prop, the handkerchief, was noted in the play&#x27;s earliest criticism. The same Thomas Rymer quoted above, in his 1693 &quot;A Short View of Tragedy&quot;, suggested that the play should better have been called &quot;The Tragedy of the Handkerchief&quot;, arguing &quot;the handkerchief is so remote a trifle, no booby on this side Mauritania could make any consequence from it.&quot;

In spite of Othello&#x27;s protestations in the first act that no magic was used in his wooing of Desdemona, he later claims magical properties for the handkerchief, his first gift to her. A question which has interested critics is whether he himself believes these stories or is using them to pressure or test Desdemona. There is certainly a contradiction between Othello&#x27;s assertion—linked to its supposed magical properties—that his mother received the handkerchief from an Egyptian charmer in Act 3 Scene 4, and his later assertion that his father gave it to his mother, made in Act 4 Scene 2. Are we, the audience, intended to believe in the handkerchief&#x27;s magical properties?

The handkerchief provides many examples of how chance operates in support of Iago&#x27;s plots: Desdemona loses it just when Iago is in need of evidence of the invented affair; Cassio fails to recognise that it is hers; Cassio gives it to Bianca to copy, who throws it back at him at the very moment when Othello is eavesdropping.

Symbolically the handkerchief represents the bond between Othello and Desdemona, and its loss the breaking of that bond: Othello blames Desdemona for its loss when in fact he casts it aside while she is trying to use it to help him. The whiteness of the handkerchief is often taken to represent Desdemona&#x27;s purity; and the red strawberries blood from her hymen symbolising her virgin marriage. In contrast, professor Ian Smith argues that a handkerchief &quot;dyed in mummy&quot; would not be white but black, and therefore symbolic of Othello.

In a 1997 production at the Royal National Theatre, the handkerchief fell to the ground immediately before the interval and remained onstage throughout it, as if—as the reviewer Richard Butler put it—&quot;challenging one of us to pick it up and prevent a tragedy.&quot;

===Othello and Iago===
Othello and Iago are two of the five longest parts in the Shakespeare canon. At 1097 lines, Iago&#x27;s is the larger of the two: only Hamlet (in &quot;Hamlet&quot;) and Richard (in &quot;Richard III&quot;) are longer.

===Genre===
&quot;Othello&quot;—although a tragedy—takes elements from other genres, including comedy. For example, there are similarities between Egeus&#x27; complaint about his daughter Hermia&#x27;s lover Lysander, in the first Act of Shakespeare&#x27;s A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream:
With cunning hast thou filched my daughter&#x27;s heartTurned her obedience which is due to meTo stubborn harshness.

And Brabantio&#x27;s complaint to the Duke in Act 1 of &quot;Othello&quot; in which he asks Desdemona:
Do you perceive, in all this noble company,Where most you owe obedience?

===Iago&#x27;s motivation===
The word &quot;honest&quot; is used more than 40 times in the play, sometimes with reference to Desdemona&#x27;s chastity, but in almost all other cases with reference to Iago, where it has a double meaning—as a condescending term for a social inferior, and as a reference to his supposed truthfulness.

Iago&#x27;s role is (in Robert Watson&#x27;s words) &quot;overdetermined in renaissance dramatic convention&quot;: he is partly the scheming Machiavel of Renaissance tragedy, partly the vengeful malcontent of revenge tragedy, partly the instigator of jealousy in domestic tragedy and partly the devil incarnate of morality plays.

The character&#x27;s own motives are never made clear, because Iago himself expresses too many motives:
*He hates the Moor: often with reference to Othello&#x27;s race.
*He is angry that Cassio has been promoted to Lieutenant, over himself.
*He suspects Othello of having slept with Emilia.
*He suspects Cassio of having slept with Emilia.
*He himself is in love with Desdemona.
*He envies Cassio&#x27;s virtues.

These led Samuel Taylor Coleridge to refer to Iago&#x27;s &quot;motive-hunting of motive-less Malignity&quot;.

Some critics have suggested other motives: psychologist Ernest Jones&#x27;s suggestion that Iago may be motivated by a repressed homosexual desire for Othello has been influential in subsequent performances of the role.

As Robert Watson summarises it: &quot;The seemingly endless critical debate about Iago&#x27;s motivation reflects a truth, rather than a confusion, about the play. ... If it is disturbing to suspect that a devil may be lurking around us in human form, perhaps within our most trusted friend, it is even more disturbing to realize that this devil may be ... a reflection of our own destructive tendencies.&quot;

Ultimately Iago provides no answer—refusing, at the end of the play, to reveal his motive: &quot;Demand me nothing. What you know, you know. From this time forth I never will speak word.&quot;

===Double time scheme===
&quot;Othello&quot; has a double time scheme—meaning that the timeframe of the play does not contain enough time for its action. Its action is continuous from Othello and Desdemona&#x27;s wedding night, except for the voyage from Venice to Cyprus (during which Cassio and Desdemona are not together) and the time in Cyprus covers an estimated 33 hours. Yet this short timeframe does not allow any time for the supposed affair between Desdemona and Cassio to have happened. In support of the short time scheme is the continuous nature of the action: the fleet arrives in Cyprus in the afternoon and the plot against Cassio proceeds that evening into the early morning; Cassio resolves to seek Desdemona&#x27;s help the following morning, and does so, commencing the long &quot;temptation scene&quot; by the end of which Othello has resolved to kill Desdemona and has ordered Iago to attempt to kill Cassio, all of which happens that same night. And this urgency is underlined by the text: in particular&#x27;s Iago&#x27;s concern that if Othello compares notes with anyone else it will become clear that Iago is playing one character against another.

But there is also a long time scheme. Iago persuades Othello that Desdemona and Cassio have &quot;the act of shame a thousand times committed&quot;; Emilia says Iago &quot;hath a hundred times&quot; asked her to steal the handkerchief; Bianca complains Cassio has been away from her &quot;a week&quot;; news of the Turkish defeat needs time to reach Venice then Lodovico needs time to reach Cyprus; and by Act 4 Roderigo (who sold all his land at the end of Act 1) has already squandered all his money.

Shakespeare&#x27;s source story in Cinthio takes place entirely in the long time scheme: Shakespeare appears to have introduced the shorter time scheme to increase dramatic tension, while also introducing moments where Iago&#x27;s plot could fall apart—for example if Emilia had given an honest answer to Desdemona&#x27;s &quot;Where should I lose that handkerchief?&quot; or if Roderigo had chosen to denounce Iago.

The discovery of a double time scheme has been ascribed to articles written by John Wilson in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1849 and 1850, although references to the problem predate that. The whole question is sometimes rejected as &quot;academic nit-picking&quot;. (Director Michael Attenborough, asked about it in an interview, replied &quot;I strongly suspect Shakespeare didn&#x27;t think about it very much.&quot;) And as Michael Neill points out, many of the problems disappear if one supposes that Othello believed Cassio and Desdemona&#x27;s affair had commenced prior to Othello and Desdemona&#x27;s elopement. Neill summarises the issue as &quot;no more than a particularly striking side-effect of the general indifference to naturalistic handling of time and space that Shakespeare shared with other dramatists of the period.&quot;

==Performance history==
=== Shakespeare&#x27;s day to the Interregnum ===
&quot;Othello&quot; was written for and performed by the King&#x27;s Men, the playing company to which Shakespeare belonged, and the 1622 Quarto notes on its title page that the play was &quot;Diuerse times acted at the Globe, and at Black-Friers, by his Maiesties seruants&quot;. These two theatres had very different features—the former a large outdoor theatre accommodating an audience of 3,000; the latter a private indoor theatre that sat around 700, paying higher prices—and the style of playing would have adapted to these different conditions. The play was performed at Court by the King&#x27;s Men on 1 November 1604, and again in 1612-13 as part of the celebrations for the Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V of the Palatinate.

The title role was originally played by Richard Burbage, whose eulogies reveal that he was admired in the role. Moorish characters were conventionally played in turbans, with long white gowns and red trousers, with the actor&#x27;s face darkened with lampblack or coal. The original Iago was likely John Lowin.

=== Restoration and 18th century ===

All theatres were closed down by the Puritan government on 6 September 1642. Upon the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, two patent companies (the King&#x27;s Company and the Duke&#x27;s Company) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them: &quot;Othello&quot; being allocated to the King&#x27;s Company&#x27;s repertoire. These patents stated that &quot;all the women&#x27;s parts to be acted in either of the said two companies for the time to come may be performed by women&quot;. The first professional acting appearance by a woman on the English stage was that of Desdemona in &quot;Othello&quot; on 8 December 1660, although history does not record who took the role. Margaret Hughes is the first woman known to have played Desdemona.

In Restoration theatres, it was common for Shakespeare&#x27;s plays to be adapted or rewritten. &quot;Othello&quot; was not adapted in this way, although it has often been cut to conform to current ideas of decorum or refinement. These cuts were not limited to removing violent, religious or sexual content, but extended on different occasions to removing references to eavesdropping, to Othello&#x27;s fit, to Othello&#x27;s tears, to the first 200 lines of the fourth act, or to the entire role of Bianca.

Among seventeenth- and eighteenth-century actors praised for expressing the nobility of the Moor—and fully exploring the degrading passions which lead to the brutal murder he commits—were Thomas Betterton and Spranger Barry. A review of the latter by John Bernard expressed how Barry&#x27;s Othello &quot;looked a few seconds in Desdemona&#x27;s face, as if to read her feelings and disprove his suspicions; then, turning away, as the adverse conviction gathered in his heart, he spoke falteringly, and gushed into tears.&quot;

The first professional performances of the play in North America are likely to have been those of the Hallam Company: Robert Upton (William Hallam&#x27;s advance man) performed &quot;Othello&quot; at a makeshift theatre in New York on 26 December 1751; and religious objections to theatre led the Hallam Company to perform &quot;Othello&quot; as a series of &quot;moral dialogues&quot; at Rhode Island in 1761.

Although not performed in Portugal until the nineteenth century, the play holds of the distinction of being the first of Shakespeare&#x27;s works to have reached a Portuguese-speaking country, possibly at the request of a Portuguese reader, in 1765.

=== 19th century ===

Paul Robeson&#x27;s iconic performance (see 20th Century, below) was not the first professional performance of the title role by a black actor: the first known is James Hewlett at the African Grove Theatre, New York, in 1822. And Hewlett&#x27;s protégé Ira Aldridge (billed as &quot;The African Roscius&quot;) played many Shakespearean roles across Europe for forty years, including Othello at the Royalty Theatre, London, in 1825.

There are stories of extravagant audience reactions to the play. One of the most extreme is related by French novelist Stendhal who reports that at the Baltimore Theatre in 1822 a soldier interrupted the performance just before Desdemona&#x27;s murder, shouting &quot;It will never be said that in my presence a confounded Negro has killed a white woman!&quot; The soldier fired his gun, breaking the arm of the actor playing Othello.

Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Othello was regarded as the most demanding of Shakespeare&#x27;s roles: it is considered a part of theatre legend that Edmund Kean collapsed while playing the role, and died two months after. Leigh Hunt saw Kean&#x27;s Othello in 1819, describing his performance in &quot;The Examiner&quot; as &quot;the masterpiece of the living stage&quot;. Before Kean, the leading exponent of the role had been John Philip Kemble who played a &quot;neoclassical hero&quot;. In contrast, Kean presented Othello as a man of romantic temperament, and uncontrollable passion. It was also Kean who initiated the so-called &quot;Bronze Age of Othello&quot; by insisting that &quot;it was a gross error to make Othello either a negro or a black&quot; and thereby commencing a stage tradition of using lighter makeup rather than blackface. An advantage of this change was that the actor&#x27;s facial expressions could be more clearly seen.

Critics have naturally focused on the two central male roles. But Emilia becomes a powerful role in the final act. Indeed Charlotte Cushman&#x27;s Emilia was said to upstage Edwin Forrest&#x27;s Othello in 1845. And when Fanny Kemble played Desdemona in 1848 she changed the performance tradition. Previously, Desdemonas had (in her words) &quot;always appeared to me to acquiesce with wonderful equanimity in their assassination&quot; but Kemble, a passionate feminist and abolitionist, decided &quot;I shall make a desperate fight for it, for I feel horribly at the idea of being murdered in my bed.&quot;

In 1848, &quot;Othello&quot; was produced by Barry Lewis at the Sans Souci Theatre in Calcutta. The casting of the white &quot;Mrs. Anderson&quot; opposite the dark-skinned Indian Baishnav Charan Auddy led to controversy, to polarized reviews, and to a fiasco on the opening night when half of the cast, military men, were prohibited from leaving barracks by order of the Brigadier of Dum Dum.

For Tommaso Salvini and Edwin Booth the role of Othello was a career-length project. Salvini always played the role in Italian, even when acting alongside a company performing in English. His conception of the role was of a barbarian with savage and passionate instincts concealed by a thick veneer of civilisation. Konstantin Stanislavski admired, and was greatly influenced by, Salvini&#x27;s Othello, which he saw in 1882. In &quot;My Life in Art&quot;, Stanislavski recalls Salvini&#x27;s scene before the Senate, saying that the actor &quot;grasped all of us in his palm, and held us there as if we were ants or flies&quot;. Booth, in complete contrast, played Othello as a restrained gentleman. When Ellen Terry played Desdemona she commented on how much Booth&#x27;s style helped her: &quot;It is difficult to preserve the simple, heroic blindness of Desdemona to the fact that her lord mistrusts her, if her lord is raving and stamping under her nose. Booth was gentle with Desdemona.&quot;

Booth was also an acclaimed Iago, and his advice to actors of the role was: &quot;to portray Iago properly you must seem to be what all the characters think and say you are, not what the spectators know you to be; try to win even &quot;them&quot; by your sincerity. Don&#x27;t &quot;act&quot; the villain.&quot;

Stanislavski himself first played Othello in 1896. He was dissatisfied with his own performance, later recalling &quot;I was able to reach nothing more than insane strain, spiritual and physical impotence, and the squeezing of tragic emotion out of myself.&quot;

=== 20th century ===
&quot;Othello&quot; was performed in the Shimpa style in Japan in 1903 by Otojiro Kawakami, resetting the location Cyprus to Taiwan, which was then a Japanese colony.

In 1930 Stanislavski directed a production of Othello for the Moscow Art Theatre, which was influential in the development of his system. The performance was directed remotely, by letter, while Stanislavski recovered from illness in France.

The most significant theatre production in wartime America featured Paul Robeson as Othello. Robeson had previously played the role in London in 1930 with a cast including Peggy Ashcroft, Sybil Thorndike and Ralph Richardson, and would later take the role for the RSC in 1959 at Stratford-Upon-Avon. Margaret Webster&#x27;s 1943 Broadway production was considered a theatrical landmark, with Robeson (in the words of Howard Barnes) &quot;making the Moor the great and terrible figure of tragedy which he has so rarely been on the stage.&quot; José Ferrer played Iago and Uta Hagen Desdemona. Taking the Broadway run with its subsequent tour, the show was seen by over half a million people. Earle Hyman saw the production numerous times when he was 17 and later recalled &quot;this tremendous excitement - the first African-American onstage to be playing this role ... to all the blacks, he &quot;represented&quot; us. It was a moment of great pride.&quot;

In 1947, Kenneth Tynan saw Frederick Valk and Donald Wolfit play Othello and Iago respectively, and described the experience as equivalent to witnessing the Chicago Fire, the Quetta Earthquake or the Hiroshima Bomb.
When Laurence Olivier performed Othello at the National in 1964, his sense of &quot;being black&quot;, in his words, required him &quot;to be beautiful&quot; with a voice &quot;dark violet - velvet stuff&quot; and a walk &quot;like a soft black leopard&quot;. (The filmed version of this production is discussed under &quot;Screen&quot; below.)

The play was extremely popular in Ethiopia, running for three years in the mid-1980s at the City Hall Theatre, Addis Ababa, in Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin&#x27;s translation – performed in a static and declamatory style. When Janet Suzman directed the play in South Africa during Apartheid in 1988, the performance was passionately politicised, with the racism of several characters—and especially Iago (modelled on Eugène Terre&#x27;Blanche)—foregrounded. The play was highly controversial—the physical contact between the black John Kani and the white Joanna Weinburg provoking walk-outs and a pile-up of hate mail.

White actors continued to dominate the role until the 1980s. Willard White in 1989 was the first black actor to play Othello at Stratford since Paul Robeson thirty years earlier.

A &quot;singular and idiosyncratic&quot; performance of a white actor in the central role was Jude Kelly&#x27;s &quot;photonegative&quot; production for the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. in 1997, in which Patrick Stewart played Othello as white, while almost all other speaking parts were played by actors of African descent. The script remained unchanged as regards the character&#x27;s race, so the white Othello was, throughout, referred to as black.

=== 21st century ===

At the turn of the century, performances at the RSC were dominated by their Iagos. Richard McCabe followed Simon Russell Beale in portraying misogynistic, embittered NCOs, older than their respective Othellos:

Singaporean director Ong Keng Sen produced an intercultural version of the play in 2000: his &quot;Desdemona&quot; featured actors, musicians, designers and artists from India, Korea, Myanmar, Indonesia and Singapore, performing in a range of different traditional Asian styles.

Cathy Downes&#x27; 2001 production at the Court Theatre in Christchurch, New Zealand made effective use of a trope (which had had racist overtones when used by earlier European directors) of Othello reverting to his native culture: setting the action in the Waikato Land Wars, Othello was a British-adopted general leading forces against his own people, until finally bursting into a &quot;terrifying wero&quot; (a warrior&#x27;s challenge) before exacting his revenge on Desdemona.

A radically different approach was taken in Jette Steckel&#x27;s 2009 German language production for the Deutsches Theater Berlin. Although the translation consistently used the word &quot;Schwarze&quot; for &quot;Moor&quot; in the original, Othello was played by the white German actress Susanne Wolff in a range of different costumes and disguises, including a gorilla suit for part of Act 4—creating a performance in which everything is (in Ayanna Thompson&#x27;s words) &quot;conveyed through representational metaphors which render Othello&#x27;s race less of a stable physical marker and more of a fractured and performative one.&quot;

A common theme of modern productions of the play is an emphasis on military life. When Adrian Lester played the role in Nicholas Hytner&#x27;s 2013 National Theatre production, a retired army veteran was employed to teach the cast about ranks, comportment and off-duty behaviours. Another 21st century trend exemplified by that performance is to reduce the focus of the play on Othello&#x27;s race by having other parts played by actors of colour also. And a third is an increasing focus on Desdemona&#x27;s youth and innocence, at the expense of her strength of character.

In 21st century productions, more emphasis has been given to the theme of domestic violence.

Othello&#x27;s &quot;difference&quot; has been tested in ways other than race. A rare example is Stein Winge&#x27;s 2015 casting of a white American actor, Bill Pullman, as an American Navy man adrift in Norway.

The play has provided opportunities for breakout roles for rising black stars, such as Chiwetel Ejiofor who played Othello at the Donmar Warehouse in 2008, and for a change of direction for other established stars: Willard White (see &quot;20th century&quot;, above) was better known as an opera singer and Lenny Henry (see &quot;True Identity&quot; under &quot;Screen&quot; below), who played Othello for Northern Broadsides in 2009, was better known as a stand-up comedian.

When Antony Sher played Iago for the RSC, the final moment of the play, before a snap blackout, was for him to look up and stare at the audience. Director Greg Doran intended this to be strange, enigmatic, open to interpretation. But Sher later wrote that he was always clear about it: in his head the question which always rang out was:

==Screen==
&quot;Othello&quot; has influenced many film makers, and often the results are adaptations, rather than performances of Shakespeare&#x27;s text. The UK&#x27;s &quot;National Film and Television Archive&quot; holds over 25 20th-Century films containing performances, adaptations or extracts from &quot;Othello&quot; including Anson Dyer&#x27;s 1920 animated &quot;Othello&quot;, 1921&#x27;s &quot;Carnival&quot; and its 1932 remake, the 1922 German film &quot;Othello&quot;, the 1936 &quot;Men Are Not Gods&quot;, 1941&#x27;s &quot;East of Piccadilly&quot;, George Cukor&#x27;s 1947 &quot;A Double Life&quot;, Orson Welles in &quot;Return to Glennascaul&quot; and Welles&#x27; own &quot;Othello&quot;, Sergei Yutkevich&#x27;s Russian language &quot;Othello&quot; discussed below, two productions for BBC Television (including Jonathan Miller&#x27;s for the BBC Television Shakespeare series, discussed below), Basil Dearden&#x27;s &quot;All Night Long&quot;, a 1988 South African TV screening of Janet Suzman&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, a film of Trevor Nunn&#x27;s RSC production with Willard White and Ian McKellen in the central roles, and &quot;True Identity&quot;—a crime caper in which Lenny Henry&#x27;s character Miles lands the role of understudy to James Earl Jones (playing himself) in a production of &quot;Othello&quot;. &quot;Carnival&quot;, &quot;Men Are Not Gods&quot; and &quot;A Double Life&quot; all feature the plot of an actor playing the title role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; developing murderous jealousy for their Desdemonas. This plot is also shared by the very first &quot;Othello&quot;-influenced film: the 18-minute Danish 1911 &quot;Desdemona&quot;. &quot;All Night Long&quot; reframes the story in a jazz milieu. And Richard Eyre&#x27;s &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; depicts a restoration performance of the play.

The filming of Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Othello&quot; was plagued by chaos. A pattern emerged where Welles would collect his cast and crew for filming, then after four or five weeks his money would run out and filming would cease: Welles would then appear in another movie, and using his acting fee would reconvene filming. Scenes in the final movie were sometimes spliced together from one actor filmed in Italy in one year, and another actor filmed in Morocco the next. Welles uses shadows, extreme camera angles and discordant piano music to force the audience to feel Othello&#x27;s disorientated view of Desdemona. Cages, grilles and bars are frequent images. And the text is heavily cut: Othello&#x27;s first words are his speech to the Senators from Act 1 Scene 3. The film was critically panned on its 1955 release (headlines included &quot;Mr Welles Murders Shakespeare in the Dark&quot; and &quot;The Boor of Venice&quot;) but was acclaimed as a classic upon its re-release in a restored version in 1992.

Sergei Yutkevich&#x27;s Russian film, with a screenplay by Boris Pasternak, was an attempt to make Shakespeare accessible to &quot;the working man&quot;. Yutkevitch had begun his career as a painter and then as a set designer, and his film was widely praised for its pictorial beauty. The director saw his film as an opposite of Welles&#x27;: where Welles began his film with a sequence from the end of the story, highlighting fate, Yutkevitch began with his Othello&#x27;s back-story, thereby highlighting his characters&#x27; free will.

Laurence Olivier said that the role of Othello demanded &quot;enormously big&quot; acting, and he incorporated what The Spectator described as his &quot;outsize, elaborate, overwhelming&quot; performance into the film of his National Theatre production. The effect to modern audiences is (in the words of Daniel Rosenthal) &quot;laughably over-the-top&quot;—in keeping with its nature as a filmed stage performance, rather than a performance designed for the screen. The film was a financial success, and earned Oscar nominations for each of Olivier as Othello, Maggie Smith as Desdemona, Frank Finlay as Iago and Joyce Redman as Emilia. Subsequent critics have been less sympathetic to Olivier&#x27;s performance than his contemporary audience had been, tending to read it as racist. As Barbara Hodgdon expresses it: &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Othello confirms an absolute fidelity to white stereotypes of blackness.&quot;

The last of the screen versions to portray Othello in blackface was Jonathan Miller&#x27;s for the BBC Television Shakespeare series, with Anthony Hopkins in the title role. Miller is said to have commented that &quot;the play is about jealousy, not race.&quot; The TV film of Willard White&#x27;s performance as &quot;Othello&quot; (discussed under 20th Century performances above) has been described by Carol Chillington Rutter as &quot;The one [screen] &quot;Othello&quot; where the women&#x27;s stories get fully told&quot;, particularly praising the dynamic between Imogen Stubbs&#x27; Desdemona and Zoë Wanamaker&#x27;s Emilia.

Oliver Parker&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Othello&quot; was trailed as an &quot;erotic thriller&quot;, including a ritualized love scene between Othello and Desdemona, and, most memorably, Othello&#x27;s jealous fantasies of encounters between Desdemona and Cassio. Swiss actress Irène Jacob as Desdemona struggled with the verse, as did Laurence Fishburne, more experienced in expletive-ridden thriller roles, as Othello. Iago was Kenneth Branagh in his first outing as a screen villain. The overall effect was to create, in Douglas Brode&#x27;s words &quot;the tragedy of Iago&quot;—a performance in which Iago&#x27;s dominance is such that Othello is a foil to him, not the other way around. The film was described as a &quot;fair stab at turning the Bard into a decent night at the multiplex&quot; but failed to achieve success at the box office.

Other adaptations of Shakespeare&#x27;s story to be filmed include Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1986 film of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; and the 1956 &quot;Jubal&quot; which resets the story as a Western, centered on the Cassio character. The play was abridged to 30 minutes by Leon Garfield, and produced with cel animation for the TV series &quot;&quot;. Tim Blake Nelson&#x27;s basketball-themed teen drama &quot;O&quot; reset the story at an elite boarding school. The similarity of the film&#x27;s ending to the Columbine massacre, which happened while the film was being edited, delayed its release for over two years, until August 2001. A British TV adaptation by Andrew Davies, screened in 2001, re-set the story among senior officers of the Metropolitan Police. And the first decade of the 21st-Century saw two non-English language film adaptations: Alexander Abela&#x27;s French &quot;Souli&quot; set the story in a modern-day Madagascan fishing village, and Vishal Bhardwaj&#x27;s Hindi &quot;Omkara&quot; amidst political violence in modern Uttar Pradesh. The 1997 Malayalam movie &quot;Kaliyattam&quot; is an adaptation set against the backdrop of Theyyam artform of Kerala. The 2024 Bengali movie &quot;Athhoi&quot; is an adaptation set against a fictional town of Vinsura in West Bengal.

==== Stage adaptations ====
Adaptations of—or borrowings from—Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; began shortly after it first appeared, including Middleton &amp; Rowley&#x27;s 1622 &quot;The Changeling&quot;, John Ford&#x27;s 1632 &quot;Love&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot;, Thomas Porter&#x27;s 1662 &quot;The Villain&quot; and Henry Nevil Payne&#x27;s 1673 &quot;The Fatal Jealousy&quot;. Edward Young&#x27;s 1721 play &quot;The Revenge&quot; reversed the racial roles, featuring the &quot;swagger part&quot; of a black villain called Zanga whose victim was a white man.

Voltaire&#x27;s 1732 French play &quot;Zaïre&quot; was a &quot;neoclassical refurbishment&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;barbarous&quot; work. And across continental Europe through most of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the play was better known than Shakespeare&#x27;s in Jean-François Ducis&#x27; adaptation and its subsequent translations, in which a heroine renamed Hédelmone is stabbed to death by Othello.

Part of the explosion of the Romantic movement in France was a fashion for re-writing English plays as melodrama, including Alfred de Vigny&#x27;s 1829 &quot;Othello&quot; adaptation &quot;Le More de Venise&quot;.

After the Restoration, London Theatres other than the patent companies got around the illegality of performing Shakespeare by allusion and parody, such as Charles Westmacott&#x27;s &quot;Othello The Moor of Fleet Street&quot; at the Adelphi in 1833.

In the 19th-Century United States, &quot;Othello&quot; was often used in parody, sometimes allied with minstrel shows: with the contrast between Shakespearean verse and African-American dialect a source of racist humour. Indeed, racist parodies were common in the aftermath of the abolition of the slave trade in the UK and, later, in the US: for example Maurice Dowling&#x27;s 1834 &quot;Othello Travestie&quot;, George W H Griffin&#x27;s 1870 &quot;Othello (Ethiopian Burlesque)&quot;, the anonymous &quot;Desdemonum An Ethiopian Burlesque&quot; of 1874 and the anonymous &quot;Dar&#x27;s de Money (Othello Burlesque)&quot; of 1880.

The Black Arts Movement appropriated &quot;Othello&quot; in an entirely different vein. Amiri Baraka&#x27;s twinned 1964 plays &quot;Dutchman&quot; and &quot;Slave&quot; are said to &quot;represent the ultimate African American revision of &quot;Othello&quot;, especially in &quot;Dutchman&#x27;s&quot; murder of Clay, a black man, by Lulu, a white woman.

The &quot;Othello&quot; story became the rock opera &quot;Catch My Soul&quot; in 1968, depicting Othello as a charismatic religious cult leader, Desdemona as a naive convert, and Iago as a malcontent cult member who thinks himself to be Satan. In Murray Carlin&#x27;s 1969 &quot;Not Now Sweet Desdemona&quot; the protagonist says of Shakespeare&#x27;s play that it was &quot;the first play of the Age of Imperialism ... &quot;Othello&quot; is about colour and nothing but colour.&quot; Charles Marowitz&#x27;s 1974 &quot;An Othello&quot; reworked the play in the context of the Black Power movement. C. Bernard Jackson&#x27;s 1979 &quot;Iago&quot; made Iago himself a Moor and a victim of racism. And Caleen Sinnette Jennings&#x27; 1999 &quot;Casting Othello&quot; is a metadrama about a performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s play, and the racial tensions it evokes.

Roysten Abel&#x27;s &quot;Othello - A Play in Black and White&quot; is set among a group of Indian actors rehearsing a Kathakali version of &quot;Othello&quot; whose own story begins to mirror the play&#x27;s plot: with Iago&#x27;s seduction of Othello played as a guru-disciple relationship.

Among feminist appropriations of the &quot;Othello&quot; story, Paula Vogel&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Desdemona, A Play about a Handkerchief&quot; sets the story in a kitchen in Cyprus, where only Desdemona, Emilia and Bianca appear. In Djanet Sears&#x27; 1998 &quot;Harlem Duet&quot;, Othello&#x27;s lover challenges his subservient passion: &quot;...why you trying to please her? ... I&#x27;m so tired of pleasing White folks.&quot; And Toni Morrison and Rokia Traoré&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Desdemona&quot; sets its story in a timeless afterlife of the characters, in which Othello and Desdemona have leisure to talk through all facets of their relationship, and in which Desdemona is reunited with her former maid Barbary, whose actual name is Sa&#x27;ran.

&quot;Othello&quot; is parodied in the form of a rap song in the stage show &quot;The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)&quot;. In 2012, the Q Brothers debuted &quot;Othello: The Remix&quot;, a 90-minute hip-hop version of &quot;Othello&quot; that was part of the Globe to Globe Festival and World Shakespeare Festival. It was one of the few sold-out shows during the festival and went on to have several successful international tours.

==== Audio ====

One of the first full-length plays to be released on vinyl was the Broadway production starring Paul Robeson, José Ferrer and Uta Hagen, issued in 1944. &quot;Othello&quot; has been performed on at least twelve separate occasions on BBC Radio.

==== Music ====

&quot;The Willow Song&quot;, sung by Desdemona in Act 4 Scene 3, is not an original creation of Shakespeare&#x27;s, but was already a well-known ballad. As such it has surviving arrangements from both before and after Shakespeare&#x27;s time. The version of it thought to be most authentic, because it closely matches the lyric given by Shakespeare, is known as &quot;The Poore Soule Sate Sighing&quot; and is one of the most performed pieces of early modern English music.

The two other songs sung in the play are the drinking songs in Act 2 Scene 3. The first of these, &quot;And Let Me The Cannikin Clink&quot;, has no surviving arrangement, although it fits to several extant popular tunes. The other, &quot;King Stephen Was a Worthy Peer&quot;, is the seventh of the eight stanzas of the existing ballad &quot;Take Thy Old Cloak About Thee&quot;.

The play has been a popular source for opera. Rossini&#x27;s 1816 &quot;Otello, ossia il Moro di Venezia&quot; made Desdemona its focus, and was followed by numerous translations and adaptations, including one with a happy ending. But the most notable version, considered a masterpiece with a power equivalent to that of the play, is Verdi&#x27;s 1887 &quot;Otello&quot;, for which Arrigo Boito&#x27;s libretto marked a return to faithfulness to the original plot, including the reappearance of the pillow as the murder weapon, rather than Ducis&#x27; dagger.

&quot;Othello&quot; was, with &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, one of the two plays which most influenced Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn&#x27;s jazz suite &quot;Such Sweet Thunder&quot;. Its opening track (itself titled &quot;Such Sweet Thunder&quot;, a quotation from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;) came to stand for Othello telling his tales of travel and adventure to Desdemona, as reported in the play&#x27;s first act.

Sometimes the order of the play influencing a composer is reversed, as in the appropriations of classical music by filmmakers retelling Othello&#x27;s story: for example in the film &quot;O&quot;, in which excerpts from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; are used as a theme for Odin (the Othello character) while modern rap and hip-hop are more associated with the white college students around him.

Bob Dylan&#x27;s song Po&#x27; Boy features lyrics in which Desdemona turns the tables on Othello, borrowing the idea of using poisoned wine from the final act of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

==== Literature ====

Aphra Behn&#x27;s 1688 novel &quot;Oroonoko&quot;, and its subsequent dramatisation by Thomas Southerne, reset Othello&#x27;s enslavement in the context of the then-current Atlantic triangle.

In addition to his theatrical performances noted above, the play was also central to Konstantin Stanislavski&#x27;s writings, and to the development of his &quot;system&quot;. In particular, the part of Othello is a main subject of his book Creating a Role. In it, the characters of Tortzov, the director, and Kostya, the young actor – both partly autobiographical – rehearse the role of Othello in the opening act.

A plot-line in Farrukh Dhondy&#x27;s novel &quot;Black Swan&quot; involves the central character Lazarus, a freed slave, travelling to London in the time of Shakespeare and authoring many of the plays attributed to Shakespeare, including &quot;Othello&quot;, in a production of which Lazarus plays the title character, and kills himself. The narrative voice of Caryl Phillips 1997 novel &quot;The Nature of Blood&quot; harangues Othello as a sexual and political sell-out. And in Sudanese novelist Tayeb Salih&#x27;s retelling of the &quot;Othello&quot; story, &quot;Season of Migration to the North&quot;, the central character Mustafa Sa&#x27;eed, on trial for the murder of his white mistress, refuses to be judged by the standards of the play, declaring:

<doc id="22461" wikidata="Q165328" url="?curid=22461" title="Osteoporosis">
<text>Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass, micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to more porous bone, and consequent increase in fracture risk.

It is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly. Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, the wrist, and the hip. 

Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms. Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously. After the broken bone heals, some people may have chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities.
Osteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bone loss. Bone loss increases after menopause in women due to lower levels of estrogen, and after andropause in older men due to lower levels of testosterone. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments, including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and after oophorectomy (surgical removal of the ovaries). Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. Smoking and getting an inadequate amount of exercise are also risk factors. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young adult. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA).
Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood, hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women, and efforts to avoid medications that increase the rate of bone loss. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking and not drinking alcohol may help. Bisphosphonate medications are useful to decrease future broken bones in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis. In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones, they are less effective. They do not appear to affect the risk of death.
Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. About 15% of Caucasians in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected. It is more common in women than men. In the developed world, depending on the method of diagnosis, 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of females are affected. Rates of disease in the developing world are unclear. About 22 million women and 5.5 million men in the European Union had osteoporosis in 2010. In the United States in 2010, about 8 million women and between 1 and 2 million men had osteoporosis. White and Asian people are at greater risk. The word &quot;osteoporosis&quot; is from the Greek terms for &quot;porous bones&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
Osteoporosis has no symptoms and the person usually does not know that they have osteoporosis until a bone is broken. Osteoporotic fractures occur in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone; they are therefore regarded as fragility fractures. Typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip and wrist. Examples of situations where people would not normally break a bone include a fall from standing height, normal day-to-day activities such as lifting, bending, or coughing.

===Fractures===
Fractures are a common complication of osteoporosis and can result in disability. Acute and chronic pain in the elderly is often attributed to fractures from osteoporosis and can lead to further disability and early mortality. These fractures may also be asymptomatic. The most common osteoporotic fractures are of the wrist, spine, shoulder and hip. The symptoms of a vertebral collapse (&quot;compression fracture&quot;) are sudden back pain, often with radicular pain (shooting pain due to nerve root compression) and rarely with spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. Multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture, loss of height, and chronic pain with resultant reduction in mobility.

Fractures of the long bones acutely impair mobility and may require surgery. Hip fracture, in particular, usually requires prompt surgery, as serious risks are associated with it, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. There is also an increased risk of mortality associated with osteoporosis-related hip fracture, with the mean average mortality rate within one year for Europe being 23.3%, for Asia 17.9%, United States 21% and Australia 24.9%.

Fracture risk calculators assess the risk of fracture based upon several criteria, including bone mineral density, age, smoking, alcohol usage, weight, and gender. Recognized calculators include FRAX, the Garvan FRC calculator and QFracture as well as the open access FREM tool. The FRAX tool can also be applied in a modification adapted to routinely collected health data.

The term &quot;established osteoporosis&quot; is used when a broken bone due to osteoporosis has occurred. Osteoporosis is a part of frailty syndrome.

===Risk of falls===
There is an increased risk of falls associated with aging. These falls can lead to skeletal damage at the wrist, spine, hip, knee, foot, and ankle. Part of the fall risk is because of impaired eyesight due to many causes, (e.g. glaucoma, macular degeneration), balance disorder, movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson&#x27;s disease), dementia, and sarcopenia (age-related loss of skeletal muscle). Collapse (transient loss of postural tone with or without loss of consciousness). Causes of syncope are manifold, but may include cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beat), vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension (abnormal drop in blood pressure on standing up), and seizures. Removal of obstacles and loose carpets in the living environment may substantially reduce falls. Those with previous falls, as well as those with gait or balance disorders, are most at risk.

=== Complications ===
As well as susceptibility to breaks and fractures, osteoporosis can lead to other complications. Bone fractures from osteoporosis can lead to disability and an increased risk of death after the injury in elderly people. Osteoporosis can decrease the quality of life, increase disabilities, and increase the financial costs to health care systems.

==Risk factors==

The risk of having osteoporosis includes age and sex. Risk factors include both nonmodifiable (for example, age and some medications that may be necessary to treat a different condition) and modifiable (for example, alcohol use, smoking, vitamin deficiency). In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable.
Caffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis.

===Nonmodifiable===

* The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age (in both men and women) and female sex; estrogen deficiency following menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density, while in men, a decrease in testosterone levels has a comparable (but less pronounced) effect.
* Ethnicity: While osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups, European or Asian ancestry predisposes for osteoporosis.
* Heredity: Those with a family history of fracture or osteoporosis are at an increased risk; the heritability of fracture risk, as well as low bone mineral density, is relatively high, ranging from 25 to 80%. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis.
* Those who have already had a fracture are at least twice as likely to have another fracture compared to someone of the same age and sex.
* Build: A small stature is also a nonmodifiable risk factor associated with the development of osteoporosis.

===Potentially modifiable===
* Alcohol: Alcohol intake greater than three units/day) may increase the risk of osteoporosis and people who consumed 0.5-1 drinks a day may have 1.38 times the risk compared to people who do not consume alcohol.
* Vitamin D deficiency: Low circulating Vitamin D is common among the elderly worldwide. Mild vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) production. PTH increases bone resorption, leading to bone loss. A positive association exists between serum 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels and bone mineral density, while PTH is negatively associated with bone mineral density.
* Tobacco smoking: Many studies have associated smoking with decreased bone health, but the mechanisms are unclear. Tobacco smoking has been proposed to inhibit the activity of osteoblasts, and is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis. Smoking also results in increased breakdown of exogenous estrogen, lower body weight and earlier menopause, all of which contribute to lower bone mineral density.
* Malnutrition: Nutrition has an important and complex role in maintenance of good bone. Identified risk factors include low dietary calcium or phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, boron, iron, fluoride, copper, vitamins A, K, E and C (and D where skin exposure to sunlight provides an inadequate supply). Excess sodium is a risk factor. High blood acidity may be diet-related, and is a known antagonist of bone. Imbalance of omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fats is yet another identified risk factor.
* A 2017 meta-analysis of published medical studies shows that higher protein diet helps slightly with lower spine density but does not show significant improvement with other bones. A 2023 meta-analysis sees no evidence for the relation between protein intake and bone health.
* Underweight/inactive: Bone remodeling occurs in response to physical stress, so physical inactivity can lead to significant bone loss. Weight bearing exercise can increase peak bone mass achieved in adolescence, and a highly significant correlation between bone strength and muscle strength has been determined. The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in overweight people.
* Endurance training: In female endurance athletes, large volumes of training can lead to decreased bone density and an increased risk of osteoporosis. This effect might be caused by intense training suppressing menstruation, producing amenorrhea, and it is part of the female athlete triad. However, for male athletes, the situation is less clear, and although some studies have reported low bone density in elite male endurance athletes, others have instead seen increased leg bone density.
* Heavy metals: A strong association between cadmium and lead with bone disease has been established. Low-level exposure to cadmium is associated with an increased loss of bone mineral density readily in both genders, leading to pain and increased risk of fractures, especially in the elderly and in females. Higher cadmium exposure results in osteomalacia (softening of the bone).
* Soft drinks: Some studies indicate soft drinks (many of which contain phosphoric acid) may increase risk of osteoporosis, at least in women. Others suggest soft drinks may displace calcium-containing drinks from the diet rather than directly causing osteoporosis.
* Proton pump inhibitors (such as lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and omeprazole), which decrease the production of stomach acid, are a risk factor for bone fractures if taken for two or more years, due to decreased absorption of calcium in the stomach.

===Medical disorders===

Many diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis. For some, the underlying mechanism influencing the bone metabolism is straightforward, whereas for others the causes are multiple or unknown.
* In general, immobilization causes bone loss. For example, localized osteoporosis can occur after prolonged immobilization of a fractured limb in a cast. This is also more common in active people with a high bone turn-over (for example, athletes). Other examples include bone loss during space flight or in people who are bedridden or use wheelchairs for various reasons.
* Hypogonadal states can cause secondary osteoporosis. These include Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, anorexia nervosa, andropause, hypothalamic amenorrhea or hyperprolactinemia. In females, the effect of hypogonadism is mediated by estrogen deficiency. It can appear as early menopause (&lt;45 years) or from prolonged premenopausal amenorrhea (&gt;1 year). Bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of the ovaries) and premature ovarian failure cause deficient estrogen production. In males, testosterone deficiency is the cause (for example, andropause or after surgical removal of the testes).
* Endocrine disorders that can induce bone loss include Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, acromegaly, and adrenal insufficiency.
* Malnutrition, parenteral nutrition and malabsorption can lead to osteoporosis. Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders that can predispose to osteoporosis include undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (both symptomatic and asymptomatic people), Crohn&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, surgery (after gastrectomy, intestinal bypass surgery or bowel resection) and severe liver disease (especially primary biliary cirrhosis). People with lactose intolerance or milk allergy may develop osteoporosis due to restrictions of calcium-containing foods. Individuals with bulimia can also develop osteoporosis. Those with an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop osteoporosis due to the inability to absorb calcium and/or vitamin D. Other micronutrients such as vitamin K or vitamin B12 deficiency may also contribute.
* People with rheumatologic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis are at increased risk of osteoporosis, either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors (notably corticosteroid therapy). Systemic diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis can also lead to osteoporosis.
* Chronic kidney disease can lead to renal osteodystrophy.
* Hematologic disorders linked to osteoporosis are multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies, lymphoma, leukemia, mastocytosis, hemophilia, sickle-cell disease and thalassemia.
* Several inherited or genetic disorders have been linked to osteoporosis. These include osteogenesis imperfecta, Multicentric carpotarsal osteolysis syndrome, Multicentric Osteolysis, Nodulosis, and Arthropathy, Marfan syndrome, hemochromatosis, hypophosphatasia (for which it is often misdiagnosed), glycogen storage diseases, homocystinuria, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, porphyria, Menkes&#x27; syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa and Gaucher&#x27;s disease.
* People with scoliosis of unknown cause also have a higher risk of osteoporosis. Bone loss can be a feature of complex regional pain syndrome. It is also more frequent in people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
* People with Parkinson&#x27;s disease have a higher risk of broken bones. This is related to poor balance and poor bone density. In Parkinson&#x27;s disease there may be a link between the loss of dopaminergic neurons and altered calcium metabolism (and iron metabolism) causing a stiffening of the skeleton and kyphosis.

===Medication===
Certain medications have been associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk; only glucocorticosteroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated, but evidence is emerging with regard to other drugs.
* Steroid-induced osteoporosis (SIOP) arises due to use of glucocorticoids – analogous to Cushing&#x27;s syndrome and involving mainly the axial skeleton. The synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug prednisone is a main candidate after prolonged intake. Some professional guidelines recommend prophylaxis in patients who take the equivalent of more than 30 mg hydrocortisone (7.5 mg of prednisolone), especially when this is in excess of three months. It is recommended to use calcium or Vitamin D as prevention. Alternate day use may not prevent this complication.
* Barbiturates, phenytoin and some other enzyme-inducing antiepileptics – these probably accelerate the metabolism of vitamin D.
* L-Thyroxine over-replacement may contribute to osteoporosis, in a similar fashion as thyrotoxicosis does. This can be relevant in subclinical hypothyroidism.
* Several drugs induce hypogonadism, for example aromatase inhibitors used in breast cancer, methotrexate and other antimetabolite drugs, depot progesterone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.
* Anticoagulants – long-term use of heparin is associated with a decrease in bone density, and warfarin (and related coumarins) have been linked with an increased risk in osteoporotic fracture in long-term use.
* Proton pump inhibitors – these drugs inhibit the production of stomach acid; this is thought to interfere with calcium absorption. Chronic phosphate binding may also occur with aluminium-containing antacids.
* Thiazolidinediones (used for diabetes) – rosiglitazone and possibly pioglitazone, inhibitors of PPARγ, have been linked with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture.
* Chronic lithium therapy has been associated with osteoporosis.

===Pregnancy-associated osteoporosis===

Osteoporosis due to pregnancy and lactation is a rare condition of unknown cause.

===Evolutionary===
Age-related bone loss is common among humans due to exhibiting less dense bones than other primate species. Because of the more porous bones of humans, frequency of severe osteoporosis and osteoporosis related fractures is higher. The human vulnerability to osteoporosis is an obvious cost but it can be justified by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such. It has been suggested that porous bones help to absorb the increased stress that we have on two surfaces compared to our primate counterparts who have four surfaces to disperse the force. In addition, the porosity allows for more flexibility and a lighter skeleton that is easier to support. One other consideration may be that diets today have much lower amounts of calcium than the diets of other primates or the tetrapedal ancestors to humans which may lead to higher likelihood to show signs of osteoporosis.

=== Fracture risk assessment ===
In the absence of risk factors other than sex and age a BMD measurement using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is recommended for women at age 65. For women with risk factors a clinical FRAX is advised at age 50.

=== Mechanics ===
Osteoporosis occurs when reduction in bone mass surpasses a critical threshold with greater susceptibility to fracturing. Fractures occur when the force acting on a bone is greater than the strength of the bone. To understand the pathology of osteoporosis and skeletal degradation, studying the mechanical properties and behavior of bone is crucial, due to the under-diagnosing of osteoporosis. Mechanical properties of a material depend on the geometry and inherent structure of the materials. Bone as a material is very complex because of its hierarchal structure in which characteristics vary across length scales. At the basic scale, bone is composed of an organic matrix of collagen type-I. Collagen type-I molecules form a composite material with hydroxyapatite to make up collagen fibrils. The hierarchal structure continuous with the fibrils being arranged into different patterns such as lamellae. The microstructure of bone then forms vascular channels, called osteons, which are surrounded by lamellae. At the subsequent scale of bones, there are different types of bone based on morphology: cortical (solid), cancellous (sponge), or trabecular (thin plates).  

A basic picture of the hierarchical structure of bones is essential because the structure will translate to the mechanical behavior of bones. Previous work indicates that osteoporotic bones undergo specific structural changes that contribute to altered mechanical behavior. For instance, a study demonstrated that osteoporotic bone exhibits reduced bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, and connectivity. In another study, osteoporosis in human cancellous bone led to 3-27% variability in the stiffness and strength compared to health bone. Additionally, bone mineral density (BMD) is a parameter used to evaluate fracture risk in bones and is used as a predictor of osteoporosis. A lower BMD value correlates to decreased bone and a higher bone fragility. Furthermore, bone diseases, such as osteoporosis, are known to alter the composition of collagen and other proteins that make up the bone matrix. These alterations in composition contribute to how bone can handle mechanical loading. Thus, osteoporosis-induced changes at the macroscopic and microscopic levels significantly impact the mechanical properties of bone, predisposing individuals to fractures even under relatively low mechanical loads. Understanding these structural alterations is vital for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis.

==Pathogenesis==

The underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. In normal bone, matrix remodeling of bone is constant; up to 10% of all bone mass may be undergoing remodeling at any point in time. The process takes place in bone multicellular units (BMUs) as first described by Frost &amp; Thomas in 1963. Osteoclasts are assisted by transcription factor PU.1 to degrade the bone matrix, while osteoblasts rebuild the bone matrix. Low bone mass density can then occur when osteoclasts are degrading the bone matrix faster than the osteoblasts are rebuilding the bone.

The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to mesenchymal stem cells biasing away from the osteoblast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. as a result of menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland. The α-form of the estrogen receptor appears to be the most important in regulating bone turnover. In addition to estrogen, calcium metabolism plays a significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.

The activation of osteoclasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) is one of the best-studied. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. lymphocytes), and stimulates RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. RANKL, RANK, and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors. The role of the Wnt signaling pathway is recognized, but less well understood. Local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover, and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis. Osteoclast maturation and activity is also regulated by activation of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Menopause-associated increase production of TNF-α stimulates stromal cells to produce colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) which activates CSF1R and stimulates osteoclasts to reabsorb bone.

Trabecular bone (or cancellous bone) is the sponge-like bone in the ends of long bones and vertebrae. Cortical bone is the hard outer shell of bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones, trabecular bone is more active and is more subject to bone turnover and remodeling. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular bone break (&quot;microcracks&quot;), and are replaced by weaker bone. Common osteoporotic fracture sites, the wrist, the hip, and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These areas rely on the trabecular bone for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced. Around the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.
==Diagnosis==
Osteoporosis often has no clear symptoms in the early stages, making it difficult to detect without screening. However, you may experience signs such as unexplained back pain, loss of height, or a stooped posture as the condition progresses. Osteoporosis can be diagnosed using conventional radiography and by measuring the bone mineral density (BMD). The most popular method of measuring BMD is dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

In addition to the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes; this may be done with blood tests. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem, investigations for cancer with metastasis to the bone, multiple myeloma, Cushing&#x27;s disease and other above-mentioned causes may be performed.

===Conventional radiography===
Conventional radiography is useful, both by itself and in conjunction with CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass; pre-osteoporosis), such as fractures; for differential diagnosis of osteopenia; or for follow-up examinations in specific clinical settings, such as soft tissue calcifications, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteomalacia in renal osteodystrophy. However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images.

The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. Vertebral height measurements can objectively be made using plain-film X-rays by using several methods such as height loss together with area reduction, particularly when looking at vertical deformity in T4-L4, or by determining a spinal fracture index that takes into account the number of vertebrae involved. Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine, leading to what is known as dowager&#x27;s hump.

===Dual-energy X-ray===
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young (30–40-year-old:58), healthy adult women reference population. This is translated as a T-score. But because bone density decreases with age, more people become osteoporotic with increasing age.:58 The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines:

The International Society for Clinical Densitometry takes the position that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone. It also states, for premenopausal women, Z-scores (comparison with age group rather than peak bone mass) rather than T-scores should be used, and the diagnosis of osteoporosis in such women also should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone.

===Biomarkers===
Chemical biomarkers are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation. The enzyme cathepsin K breaks down type-I collagen, an important constituent in bones. Prepared antibodies can recognize the resulting fragment, called a neoepitope, as a way to diagnose osteoporosis. Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarker for osteoporosis.

===Other measuring tools===
Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) differs from DXA in that it gives separate estimates of BMD for trabecular and cortical bone and reports precise volumetric mineral density in mg/cm3 rather than BMD&#x27;s relative Z-score. Among QCT&#x27;s advantages: it can be performed at axial and peripheral sites, can be calculated from existing CT scans without a separate radiation dose, is sensitive to change over time, can analyze a region of any size or shape, excludes irrelevant tissue such as fat, muscle, and air, and does not require knowledge of the patient&#x27;s subpopulation in order to create a clinical score (e.g. the Z-score of all females of a certain age). Among QCT&#x27;s disadvantages: it requires a high radiation dose compared to DXA, CT scanners are large and expensive, and because its practice has been less standardized than BMD, its results are more operator-dependent. Peripheral QCT has been introduced to improve upon the limitations of DXA and QCT.

Quantitative ultrasound has many advantages in assessing osteoporosis. The modality is small, no ionizing radiation is involved, measurements can be made quickly and easily, and the cost of the device is low compared with DXA and QCT devices. The calcaneus is the most common skeletal site for quantitative ultrasound assessment because it has a high percentage of trabecular bone that is replaced more often than cortical bone, providing early evidence of metabolic change. Also, the calcaneus is fairly flat and parallel, reducing repositioning errors. The method can be applied to children, neonates, and preterm infants, just as well as to adults. Some ultrasound devices can be used on the tibia.

==Screening==
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend that all women 65 years of age or older be screened by bone densitometry. Additionally they recommend screening younger women with risk factors. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations about the intervals for repeated screening and the appropriate age to stop screening.

In men the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown. Prescrire states that the need to test for osteoporosis in those who have not had a previous bone fracture is unclear. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry suggest BMD testing for men 70 or older, or those who are indicated for risk equal to that of a 70‑year‑old. A number of tools exist to help determine who is reasonable to test.

==Prevention==

Lifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is in many aspects the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors. As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it.

In people with coeliac disease adherence to a gluten-free diet decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis and increases bone density. The diet must ensure optimal calcium intake (of at least one gram daily) and measuring vitamin D levels is recommended, and to take specific supplements if necessary.

Osteoporosis can affect nearly 1 in 3 women and the bone loss is the most rapid within the first 2–3 years after menopause. This can be prevented by menopause hormone therapy or MHT, which is meant to prevent bone loss and the degradation of the bone microarchitecture and is noted to reduce the risk of fractures in bones by 20-30%. However, MHT has been linked to safety concerns, so it is not generally recommended. As far as management goes with this potentially limiting disease, there are practices that can and should be implemented within the daily lifestyle. For example, it would be beneficial if the individual with osteoporosis refrained from consuming excess alcohol and to avoid smoking. These individuals should also be intentional about intaking an adequate amount of protein, calcium, and vitamin D. If the woman has an even higher risk of fracture, managing this may require therapy. Generally, the recommended treatment of prevention for a decrease in bone mineral density is physical activity. Exercise is sometimes the best medicine. Resistance training is the most recommended method of physical activity but that can come in multiple forms. High intensity and high impact training is shown to be extremely beneficial in improving bone health and the most effective in improving, maintaining, bone density in the lower spine and femur. Although these types of exercises are safe for postmenopausal women, there still may be a need for supervision and precautionary measures.

===Nutrition===

Studies of the benefits of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D are conflicting, possibly because most studies did not have people with low dietary intakes. A 2018 review by the USPSTF found low-quality evidence that the routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements (or both supplements together) did not reduce the risk of having an osteoporotic fracture in male and female adults living in the community who had no known history of vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or a fracture. The USPSTF does not recommend low dose supplementation (less than 1 g of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) in postmenopausal women as there does not appear to be a difference in fracture risk. A 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calcium decreases the risk of fractures. While some meta-analyses have found a benefit of vitamin D supplements combined with calcium for prevention of fractures, they did not find a benefit of vitamin D supplements (800 IU/day or less) alone. Regarding adverse effects, supplementation does not appear to affect overall risk of death, although calcium supplementation could potentially be associated with some increased risk of myocardial infarctions, stroke, kidney stones, and gastrointestinal symptoms. There is no evidence that supplementation before menopause can enhance bone mineral density.

Vitamin K deficiency is also a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. The gene gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) is dependent on vitamin K. Functional polymorphisms in the gene could attribute to variation in bone metabolism and BMD. Vitamin K2 is also used as a means of treatment for osteoporosis and the polymorphisms of GGCX could explain the individual variation in the response to treatment of vitamin K.

Dietary sources of calcium include dairy products, leafy greens, legumes, and beans. There has been conflicting evidence about whether or not dairy is an adequate source of calcium to prevent fractures. The National Academy of Sciences recommends 1,000 mg of calcium for those aged 19–50, and 1,200 mg for those aged 50 and above. A review of the evidence shows no adverse effect of higher protein intake on bone health.

=== Physical exercise ===
Evidence suggests that exercise can help promote bone health in older people. In particular, physical exercise can be beneficial for bone density in postmenopausal women, and lead to a slightly reduced risk of a bone fracture (absolute difference 4%). Weight bearing exercise has been found to cause an adaptive response in the skeleton, promoting osteoblast activity and protecting bone density. A position statement concluded that increased bone activity and weight-bearing exercises at a young age prevent bone fragility in adults. Limitations in the available evidence hinder the production of detailed evidence-based exercise recommendations. Some expert consensus guidance does exist. International guidelines recommend multicomponent exercise tailored to individual needs that includes &quot;balance and mobility training, paired with weight bearing exercise, progressive resistance training, and posture exercises&quot; (generally accompanied by optimal nutrition). Cycling and swimming are not considered weight-bearing exercise, and neither helps slow age-related bone loss (professional bicycle racing has a negative effect on bone density). Risk of adverse events from the types of exercise usually considered appropriate for people with osteoporosis is generally low (though repeated forceful forward spinal bends are discouraged).

For people who have had vertebral fractures, there is moderate-quality evidence that exercise is likely to improve physical performance, as well as some low-quality evidence suggesting that exercise may reduce pain and improve quality of life.

=== Physical exercise prescription ===
Osteoporosis is a very prevalent disease in the elderly population but not much is known about the optimal prescription and dosage of physical exercise to help prevent bone mineral loss. A lot of the focus around osteoporosis is also prevention and not so much maintenance which should be the front runner when considering what approach to take. When prescribing exercise, an aspect to take into consideration is the individual’s need this can be attained by conducting a pre-exercise evaluation or screening, exercise should also be tailored to the individual and what works for them. Important things often overlooked when treating osteoporosis are muscle strength and maintenance of BMD, which should be incorporated into the program to optimize the benefits of exercise. This entails including exercises that focus on and improve muscle strength and exercises that focus on and improve skeletal strength or BMD as these go hand in hand for reducing fall and fracture risk. It’s also important to reference the ACSM general training principle to better design a program for the individual. Which mode of exercise and dosage has been a recurring question for treating osteoporosis, many articles have found that multimodal exercise programs have had findings of significant improvement in factors related to osteoporosis. Factors include lower limb strength, balance, flexibility, and risk of falls. Other modes of exercise have also proven to improve individuals with osteoporosis, some of these modes include weight-bearing, resistance specifically progressive resistance, and aerobic exercise. The recommendations for these types of exercises are as follows, weight-bearing exercise should be done 4–7 days a week, moderate to high intensity, activities should be multidirectional, and load should be more than typical everyday load on bones. Some examples of exercises are jumping, skipping, hopping, depth jumps, etc.  Recommended dosage for progressive resistance training is 2 or more days a week, intensity (load) should start low and increase gradually. Resistance training should focus on major muscle groups used for functional movements as well as muscles that have direct stress on bones susceptible to fracture. Considerations for resistance training are to teach proper lifting techniques and be careful with lifting weights above the head. Lastly, aerobic exercise has minimal effect on preventing BMD loss unless done at a higher intensity or with a load like a weighted vest. Considerations with this mode are that this may cause a higher risk of fall or fracture. Improvements can also be observed in other ways, such as decreased Timed-Up-and-Go, increased Sit-To-Stand, and increased One-Leg-Stance-Test. A study with a 12-week exercise intervention on postmenopausal osteoporotic women observed a 2.27 decrease in TUG times in their experimental group. The overall thing to note when prescribing exercise for individuals with osteoporosis is to evaluate the individual&#x27;s needs and then individualize their program with multiple exercise modalities that work for them, emphasizing increasing muscle strength as well as maintaining bone mass.

=== Physical therapy ===
People with osteoporosis are at higher risk of falls due to poor postural control, muscle weakness, and overall deconditioning. Postural control is important to maintaining functional movements such as walking and standing. Physical therapy may be an effective way to address postural weakness that may result from vertebral fractures, which are common in people with osteoporosis. Physical therapy treatment plans for people with vertebral fractures include balance training, postural correction, trunk and lower extremity muscle strengthening exercises, and moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity. The goal of these interventions are to regain normal spine curvatures, increase spine stability, and improve functional performance. Physical therapy interventions were also designed to slow the rate of bone loss through home exercise programs.

Whole body vibration therapy has also been suggested as a physical therapy intervention. Moderate to low-quality evidence indicates that whole body vibration therapy may reduce the risk of falls. There are conflicting reviews as to whether vibration therapy improves bone mineral density.

Physical therapy can aid in overall prevention in the development of osteoporosis through therapeutic exercise. Prescribed amounts of mechanical loading or increased forces on the bones promote bone formation and vascularization in various ways, therefore offering a preventative measure that is not reliant on drugs. Specific exercise interacts with the body&#x27;s hormones and signaling pathways which encourages the maintenance of a healthy skeleton.

=== Hormone therapy ===
Reduced estrogen levels increase the risk of osteoporosis, so hormone replacement therapy when women reach the menopause may reduce the incidence of osteoporosis. A more natural way of restoring hormone levels in postmenopausal women include participating in specific forms of exercise. Weight-bearing exercises and resistance training exercises such as squats with weights, step-ups, lunges, stair climbing, and even jogging can elicit hormone responses that are advantageous for post-menopausal women living with osteoporosis. These exercises result in the release of growth hormone and Insulin-like growth factor-1 or IGF-1 that participate in bone remodeling. Stress is applied to the bones, thus activating osteoblast, which are cells that form new bones and grow and heal existing bones while restoring hormones that increase bone density. Resistance training exercises, like weight lifting, can lead to brief increased in anabolic hormones, like testosterone, which aid in muscle and bone strength. The increase in mechanical tension during resistance exercise will likely help stimulate the production of Insulin-like growth factors in the bone, but at a greater extent. Post-menopausal women experience a reduction of estrogen, which is essential for density, so these exercise-induced hormonal enhancements can counteract the loss of bone mineral density in the most critical area, like the lumbar spine and the femoral neck. Research suggest that regular resistance training accompanied with weight-bearing activities help reduce the progression of osteoporosis and risk of fracture.

==Management==

===Lifestyle Changes===
Weight-bearing endurance exercise and/or exercises to strengthen muscles improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis. Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women. Daily intake of calcium and vitamin D is recommended for postmenopausal women. Fall prevention can help prevent osteoporosis complications. There is some evidence for hip protectors specifically among those who are in care homes.

=== Pharmacologic therapy ===
The US National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends pharmacologic treatment for patients with hip or spine fracture thought to be related to osteoporosis, those with BMD 2.5 SD or more below the young normal mean (T-score -2.5 or below), and those with BMD between 1 and 2.5 SD below normal mean whose 10-year risk, using FRAX, for hip fracture is equal or more than 3%.

Bisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures in those who have already sustained a fracture due to osteoporosis. This benefit is present when taken for three to four years. They do not appear to change the overall risk of death. Tentative evidence does not support the use of bisphosphonates as a standard treatment for secondary osteoporosis in children. Different bisphosphonates have not been directly compared, therefore it is unknown if one is better than another. Fracture risk reduction is between 25 and 70% depending on the bone involved. There are concerns of atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw with long-term use, but these risks are low. With evidence of little benefit when used for more than three to five years and in light of the potential adverse events, it may be appropriate to stop treatment after this time. One medical organization recommends that after five years of medications by mouth or three years of intravenous medication among those at low risk, bisphosphonate treatment can be stopped. In those at higher risk they recommend up to ten years of medication by mouth or six years of intravenous treatment.

The goal of osteoporosis management is to prevent osteoporotic fractures, but for those who have sustained one already it is more urgent to prevent a secondary fracture. That is because patients with a fracture are more likely to experience a recurrent fracture, with marked increase in morbidity and mortality compared. Among the five bisphosphonates, no significant differences were found for a secondary fracture for all fracture endpoints combined. That being said, alendronate was identified as the most efficacious for secondary prevention of vertebral and hip fractures while zoledronate showed better performance for nonvertebral non-hip fracture prevention. There is concern that many people do not receive appropriate pharmacological therapy after a low-impact fracture.
For those with osteoporosis but who have not had a fracture, evidence does not support a reduction in fracture risk with risedronate or etidronate. Alendronate decreases fractures of the spine but does not have any effect on other types of fractures. Half stop their medications within a year. When on treatment with bisphosphonates rechecking bone mineral density is not needed. There is tentative evidence of benefit in males with osteoporosis.
Fluoride supplementation does not appear to be effective in postmenopausal osteoporosis, as even though it increases bone density, it does not decrease the risk of fractures.
Teriparatide (a recombinant parathyroid hormone) has been shown to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy, while effective for osteoporosis, is only recommended in women who also have menopausal symptoms. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. Raloxifene, while effective in decreasing vertebral fractures, does not affect the risk of nonvertebral fracture. And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. While denosumab is effective at preventing fractures in women, there is not clear evidence of benefit in males. In hypogonadal men, testosterone has been shown to improve bone quantity and quality, but, as of 2008, no studies evaluated its effect on fracture risk or in men with normal testosterone levels. Calcitonin while once recommended is no longer recommended due to the associated risk of cancer and questionable effect on fracture risk. Alendronic acid/colecalciferol can be taken to treat this condition in post-menopausal women.

Romosozumab (sold under the brand name Evenity) is a monoclonal antibody against sclerostin. Romosozumab is usually reserved for patients with very high fracture risk and is the only available drug therapy for osteoporosis that leads to simultaneous inhibition of bone resorption together with an anabolic effect.

Certain medications like alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, and strontium ranelate can help to prevent osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Tentative evidence suggests that Chinese herbal medicines may have potential benefits on bone mineral density.

==Prognosis==

Although people with osteoporosis have increased mortality due to the complications of fracture, the fracture itself is rarely lethal.

Hip fractures can lead to decreased mobility and additional risks of numerous complications (such as deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia). The six-month mortality rate for those aged 50 and above following hip fracture was found to be around 13.5%, with a substantial proportion (almost 13%) needing total assistance to mobilize after a hip fracture.

Vertebral fractures, while having a smaller impact on mortality, can lead to severe chronic pain of neurogenic origin, which can be hard to control, as well as deformity. Though rare, multiple vertebral fractures can lead to such severe hunchback (kyphosis), the resulting pressure on internal organs can impair one&#x27;s ability to breathe.

Apart from risk of death and other complications, osteoporotic fractures are associated with a reduced health-related quality of life.

The condition is responsible for millions of fractures annually, mostly involving the lumbar vertebrae, hip, and wrist. Fragility fractures of ribs are also common in men.

===Fractures===
Hip fractures are responsible for the most serious consequences of osteoporosis. In the United States, more than 250,000 hip fractures annually are attributable to osteoporosis. A 50-year-old white woman is estimated to have a 17.5% lifetime risk of fracture of the proximal femur. The incidence of hip fractures increases each decade from the sixth through the ninth for both women and men for all populations. The highest incidence is found among men and women ages 80 or older.

Between 35 and 50% of all women over 50 had at least one vertebral fracture. In the United States, 700,000 vertebral fractures occur annually, but only about a third are recognized. In a series of 9704 women aged 68.8 on average studied for 15 years, 324 had already sustained a vertebral fracture at entry into the study and 18.2% developed a vertebral fracture, but that risk rose to 41.4% in women who had a previous vertebral fracture.

In the United States, 250,000 wrist fractures annually are attributable to osteoporosis. Wrist fractures are the third most common type of osteoporotic fractures. The lifetime risk of sustaining a Colles&#x27; fracture is about 16% for white women. By the time women reach age 70, about 20% have had at least one wrist fracture.

Fragility fractures of the ribs are common in men as young as age 35. These are often overlooked as signs of osteoporosis, as these men are often physically active and develop the fracture in the course of physical activity, such as falling while water skiing or jet skiing.

==Epidemiology==
Osteoporosis becomes more common with age, especially after 50 years (its prevalence rises from about 2% at 50 years to almost 50% by the age of 80). It affects women more than men due to the sharp fall in estrogen production that follows menopause. Globally, it is estimated that 21.2% of women and 6.3% of men over the age of 50 have osteoporosis, corresponding to a total of around 500 million people worldwide. About 15% of Caucasians in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected. In the developed world, depending on the method of diagnosis, 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of females are affected. Rates of disease in the developing world are unclear.

From the age of 50 onwards, fractures (including hip fractures) are roughly twice as common in women than in men. A 60-year-old woman has a 44% chance of experiencing a fracture in her lifetime, whereas the lifetime risk for a 60-year-old man is only 25%. Such differences can be attributed to the increased risk of osteoporosis due to decreased estrogen levels following menopause.

In 2019, up to 37 million fragility fractures linked to osteoporosis were thought to occur in people over the age of 55 worldwide. Globally, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will have an osteoporotic fracture. Data from the United States shows a decrease in osteoporosis within the general population and in white women, from 18% in 1994 to 10% in 2006. White and Asian people are at greater risk. People of African descent are at a decreased risk of fractures due to osteoporosis, although they have the highest risk of death following an osteoporotic fracture.

It has been shown that latitude affects risk of osteoporotic fracture. Areas of higher latitude such as Northern Europe receive less Vitamin D through sunlight compared to regions closer to the equator, and consequently have higher fracture rates in comparison to lower latitudes. For example, Swedish men and women have a 13% and 28.5% risk of hip fracture by age 50, respectively, whereas this risk is only 1.9% and 2.4% in Chinese men and women. Diet may also be a factor that is responsible for this difference, as vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and folate are all linked to bone mineral density.

There is also an association between Celiac Disease and increased risk of osteoporosis. In studies with premenopausal females and males, there was a correlation between Celiac Disease and osteoporosis and osteopenia. Celiac Disease can decrease absorption of nutrients in the small intestine such as calcium, and a gluten-free diet can help people with Celiac Disease to revert to normal absorption in the gut.

About 22 million women and 5.5 million men in the European Union had osteoporosis in 2010. In the United States in 2010 about 8 million women and one to 2 million men had osteoporosis. This places a large economic burden on the healthcare system due to costs of treatment, long-term disability, and loss of productivity in the working population. The EU spends 37 billion euros per year in healthcare costs related to osteoporosis, and the US spends an estimated US$19 billion annually for related healthcare costs.

==History==
Research on age-related reductions in bone density goes back to the early 1800s. French pathologist Jean Lobstein coined the term &quot;osteoporosis&quot;. The American endocrinologist Fuller Albright linked osteoporosis with the postmenopausal state.

Anthropologists have studied skeletal remains that showed loss of bone density and associated structural changes that were linked to a chronic malnutrition in the agricultural area in which these individuals lived. &quot;It follows that the skeletal deformation may be attributed to their heavy labor in agriculture as well as to their chronic malnutrition&quot;, causing the osteoporosis seen when radiographs of the remains were made.

<text>The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is a department of the United Nations Secretariat that works to promote and protect human rights that are guaranteed under international law and stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. The office was established by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 December 1993 in the wake of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights.

The office is headed by the high commissioner for human rights, who co-ordinates human rights activities throughout the United Nations System and acts as the secretariat of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. The eighth and current high commissioner is Volker Türk of Austria, who succeeded Michelle Bachelet of Chile on 8 September 2022.

In 2018–2019, the department had a budget of US$201.6 million (3.7 per cent of the United Nations regular budget), and approximately 1,300 employees based in Geneva and New York City. It is an ex officio member of the Committee of the United Nations Development Group.

==Functions and organization==

===Mandate===

The mandate of OHCHR derives from Articles 1, 13 and 55 of the Charter of the United Nations, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and General Assembly resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, by which the Assembly established the post of United Nations high commissioner for human rights. In connection with the programme for reform of the United Nations (A/51/950, para. 79), the OHCHR and the Centre for Human Rights were consolidated into a single OHCHR on 15 September 1997.

===Purpose===
The objectives of OHCHR are to:

# Promote universal enjoyment of all human rights by giving practical effect to the will and resolve of the world community as expressed by the United Nations

===Organization===
The OHCHR is divided into organizational units, as described below. The OHCHR is headed by a High Commissioner with the rank of Under-Secretary-General.

==== High Commissioner for Human Rights (Under-Secretary-General) ====
The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, accountable to the secretary-general, is responsible for all the activities of the OHCHR, as well as for its administration, and carries out the functions specifically assigned to him or her by the UN General Assembly in its resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993 and subsequent resolutions of policy-making bodies. He or she advises the Secretary-General on the policies of the United Nations in the area of human rights, ensures that substantive and administrative support is given to the projects, activities, organs and bodies of the human rights programme, represents the secretary-general at meetings of human rights organs and at other human rights events, and carries out special assignments as decided by the secretary-general. As well as those human rights that are currently included in legally binding treaties, the high commissioner also promotes human rights yet to be recognized in international law (such as the adoption of economic, social and cultural rights as a strategic priority, which are not all currently recognized in international legal instruments).

==== Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights (Assistant Secretary-General) ====
The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, in the performance of his or her activities, is assisted by a deputy high commissioner who acts as officer-in-charge during the absence of the high commissioner. In addition, the deputy high commissioner carries out specific substantive and administrative assignments as decided by the high commissioner. The deputy is accountable to the high commissioner.

The current deputy high commissioner for human rights is the Australian national Kate Gilmore.

==== Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights (UN Headquarters New York) ====
The assistant secretary-general for Human Rights (not to be confused with the deputy high commissioner, who is also an assistant secretary-general) is based in New York City and heads the New York Office of the High Commissioner. The New York Office represents the high commissioner at United Nations Headquarters in New York and promotes the integration of human rights in policy processes and activities undertaken by inter-governmental and inter-agency bodies at the United Nations.

The post of assistant secretary-general for human rights was created in 2010, when Ivan Šimonović was appointed to the position. From 2016 to 2019, the position was held by Andrew Gilmour. The current assistant secretary-general for human rights, since 2020, is .

==Criticisms==
Journalist Emma Reilly leaked e-mails in 2020 and 2021 in which the OHCHR provided names of Chinese participants in UN human rights activities to China on request. This occurred on multiple occasions from before 2012 to at least 2019, despite an explicit ban against this sort of activity. In some cases, after obtaining their name in advance from the UN, the Chinese Communist Party made sure an activist was not able to leave China for Geneva to attend.

<doc id="22467" wikidata="Q217528" url="?curid=22467" title="Oklahoma City bombing">
<text>The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, on April 19, 1995, the second anniversary of the end to the Waco siege. The bombing remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history.

Perpetrated by anti-government extremists Timothy McVeigh, the mastermind, and Terry Nichols, the bombing occurred at 9:02 a.m. and killed 167 people, injured 684, and destroyed more than one-third of the building, which had to be demolished. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings and caused an estimated $652 million worth of damage. Local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies engaged in extensive rescue efforts in the wake of the bombing. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers. A rescue worker was killed indirectly after being struck on the head by falling debris after the bombing.

Within 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the Gulf War and a sympathizer with the U.S. militia movement, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives he parked in front of the building. Nichols had assisted with the bomb&#x27;s preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and its handling of Ruby Ridge in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the fire that ended the siege in Waco as well as the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first engagements of the American Revolution. Though not confirmed to be a direct connection to the bombing, white supremacist Richard Snell, who was executed that same day, previously expressed a desire to blow up the Murrah Federal Building 12 years before the bombing took place.

The official FBI investigation, known as &quot;OKBOMB&quot;, involved 28,000 interviews, 3,200 kg (7,100 lbs) of evidence, and nearly one billion pieces of information. When the FBI raided McVeigh&#x27;s home, they found a telephone number that led them to a farm where McVeigh had purchased supplies for the bombing. The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997. McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, at the U.S. federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison in 2004. In response to the bombing, the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which limited access to habeas corpus in the United States, among other provisions. It also passed legislation to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks.

==Events==

===Planning===
====Motive====

The chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic training for the U.S. Army. McVeigh met Michael Fortier as his Army roommate. The three shared interests in survivalism. McVeigh and Nichols were radicalized by white supremacist and antigovernment propaganda. They expressed anger at the federal government&#x27;s handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, as well as the Waco siege, a 51-day standoff in 1993 between the FBI and Branch Davidian members that began with a botched Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) attempt to execute a search and arrest warrant. There was a firefight and ultimately a siege of the compound, resulting in the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75 others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff, and again after the siege ended. He later decided to bomb a federal building as a response to the raids and to protest what he believed to be U.S. government efforts to restrict rights of private citizens, particularly those under the Second Amendment. McVeigh believed that federal agents were acting like soldiers, thus making an attack on a federal building an attack on their command centers.

===Target selection===

McVeigh later said that, instead of bombing a building, he had contemplated a &quot;campaign of individual assassination&quot;. Potential targets in this campaign included United States Attorney General, Janet Reno, and FBI Hostage Rescue Team sniper, Lon Horiuchi. He initially intended to destroy only a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be more powerful if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh&#x27;s criterion for attack sites was that the target should house at least two of these three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.

A resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He said in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out Simmons Tower, a 40-story building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because a florist&#x27;s shop occupied space on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect what would become the target of their campaign: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.

The nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed 14 federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps.

McVeigh chose the Murrah building because he expected its glass front to shatter under the impact of the blast. He also believed that its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. McVeigh also believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. He planned the attack for April 19, 1995, to coincide with the second anniversary of the Waco siege, and also the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord during the American Revolution. Rumors have alleged that the bombing was also connected to the planned execution of Richard Snell, an Arkansas white supremacist who was a member of the Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) and who was due to be executed the day the bombing took place. Prior to his execution, Snell predicted that a bombing would take place that day. Though his execution was not confirmed to be a motive for the bombing, Fort Smith–based federal prosecutor Steven Snyder told the FBI in May 1995 that Snell wanted to blow up the Oklahoma City building as revenge for the IRS raiding his home.

====Gathering materials====

McVeigh and Nichols bought or stole the materials they needed to manufacture the bomb and stored them in rented sheds. In August 1994, McVeigh obtained nine binary-explosive Kinestiks from gun collector Roger E. Moore, and with Nichols ignited the devices outside Nichols&#x27;s home in Herington, Kansas. On September 30, 1994, Nichols bought forty bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer from Mid-Kansas Coop in McPherson, Kansas, enough to fertilize of farmland at a rate of of nitrogen per acre (.4 ha), an amount commonly used for corn. Nichols bought an additional bag on October 18, 1994. McVeigh approached Fortier and asked him to assist with the bombing project, but he refused.

McVeigh and Nichols robbed Moore in his home of $60,000 worth of guns, gold, silver, and jewels, transporting the property in the victim&#x27;s van. McVeigh wrote Moore a letter in which he claimed that government agents had committed the robbery. Items stolen from Moore were later found in Nichols&#x27;s home and in a storage shed he had rented.

In October 1994, McVeigh showed Michael and his wife Lori Fortier a diagram he had drawn of the bomb he wanted to build. McVeigh planned to construct a bomb containing more than of ammonium nitrate fertilizer mixed with about of liquid nitromethane and of Tovex. Including the weight of the sixteen 55-gallon drums in which the explosive mixture was to be packed, the bomb would have a combined weight of about . McVeigh originally intended to use hydrazine rocket fuel, but it proved too expensive.

McVeigh and his accomplices then attempted to purchase drums of nitromethane at various NHRA Drag Racing Series events during the season. His first attempt was at the Sears Craftsman Nationals, held at Heartland Motorsports Park in Pauline, Kansas. World Wide Racing Fuels representative Steve Lesueur, one of three dealers of nitromethane, was at his unit when he noted a &quot;young man in fatigues&quot; wanted to purchase nitromethane and hydrazine. Another fuel salesman, Glynn Tipton, of VP Racing Fuels, testified on May 1, 1997, about McVeigh&#x27;s attempts to buy nitromethane and hydrazine. After the event, Tipton informed Wade Gray of Texas Allied Chemical, a chemical agent for VP Racing Fuels, who informed Tipton of the explosiveness of a nitromethane and hydrazine mixture. McVeigh, using an assumed name, then called Tipton&#x27;s office. Suspicious of his behavior, Tipton refused to sell McVeigh the fuel.
The next round of the NHRA championship tour was the Chief Auto Parts Nationals at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis, Texas, where McVeigh posed as a motorcycle racer and attempted to purchase nitromethane on the pretext that he and some fellow bikers needed it for racing. However, there were no nitromethane-powered motorcycles at the meeting, and he did not have an NHRA competition license. Lesueur again refused to sell McVeigh the fuel because he was suspicious of McVeigh&#x27;s actions and attitudes, but VP Racing Fuels representative Tim Chambers sold McVeigh three barrels. Chambers questioned the purchase of three barrels, when typically no more than five gallons would be purchased by a Top Fuel Harley rider, and the class was not even raced that weekend.

McVeigh rented a storage space in which he stockpiled seven crates of Tovex &quot;sausages&quot;, 80 spools of shock tube, and 500 electric blasting caps, which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in Marion, Kansas. He decided not to steal any of the of ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil) he found at the scene, as he did not believe it was powerful enough (he did obtain 17 bags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb that was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.

Later, speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations, he said, &quot;You learn how to handle killing in the military. I face the consequences, but you learn to accept it.&quot; He compared his actions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, rather than the attack on Pearl Harbor, reasoning it was necessary to prevent more lives from being lost.

On April 14, 1995, McVeigh paid for a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas. The next day, he rented a 1993 Ford F-700 truck from Ryder under the name Robert D. Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, and because it reminded him of the Klingon warriors of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. On April 16, 1995, he and Nichols drove to Oklahoma City, where he parked a getaway car, a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis, several blocks from the Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments&#x27; lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols&#x27;s blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16. After removing the car&#x27;s license plate, he left a note covering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) plate that read, &quot;Not abandoned. Please do not tow. Will move by April 23. (Needs battery &amp; cable).&quot; Both men then returned to Kansas.

====Building the bomb====

On April 17–18, 1995, McVeigh and Nichols removed the bomb supplies from their storage unit in Herington, Kansas, where Nichols lived, and loaded them into the Ryder rental truck. They then drove to Geary Lake State Park, where they nailed boards onto the floor of the truck to hold the 13 barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale. Each filled barrel weighed nearly . McVeigh added more explosives to the driver&#x27;s side of the cargo bay so he could ignite at close range with his Glock 21 pistol in case the primary fuses failed. During McVeigh&#x27;s trial, Lori Fortier stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a shaped charge. This was achieved by (placing material against explosives opposite the target of the explosion) the aluminum side panel of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building. Specifically, McVeigh arranged the barrels in the shape of a backwards &quot;J&quot;; he later said that for pure destructive power, he would have put the barrels on the side of the cargo bay closest to the Murrah Building; however, such an unevenly distributed load might have broken an axle, flipped the truck over, or at least caused it to lean to one side, which could have drawn attention. All or most of the barrels of ANNM (ammonium nitrate–nitromethane mixture) contained metal cylinders of acetylene intended to increase the fireball and the brisance of the explosion.

McVeigh then added a dual-fuse ignition system accessible from the truck&#x27;s front cab. He drilled two holes in the cab of the truck under the seat, while two more holes were drilled in the body of the truck. One green cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around of the high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck&#x27;s livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the of Tovex Blastrite Gel sausages, which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13 filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the two men separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh traveled with the truck to Junction City. The bomb cost about to make.

===Bombing===

McVeigh&#x27;s original plan had been to detonate the bomb at 11:00 a.m., but at dawn on April 19, 1995, he decided instead to destroy the building at 9:00 a.m. As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;—a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot; (&quot;Thus always to tyrants&quot;)—what according to legend Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar and is also claimed to have been shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln—and &quot;The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants&quot; (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the slogan, falsely attributed to Thomas Jefferson, &quot;When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.&quot; Underneath, McVeigh had written, &quot;Maybe now, there will be liberty!&quot; with a hand-copied quote by John Locke asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty.

McVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50 a.m. At 8:57 a.m., the Regency Towers Apartments&#x27; lobby security camera that had recorded Nichols&#x27;s pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the Murrah Federal Building. At the same moment, McVeigh lit the five-minute fuse. Three minutes later, still a block away, he lit the two-minute fuse. He parked the Ryder truck in a drop-off zone situated under the building&#x27;s day-care center, exited, and locked the truck. As he headed to his getaway vehicle, he dropped the keys to the truck a few blocks away.

At 9:02 a.m. (14:02 UTC), the Ryder truck, containing over of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and diesel fuel mixture, detonated in front of the north side of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. In total, 168 people were killed and hundreds more injured. One-third of the building was destroyed by the explosion, which created a , crater on NW 5th Street next to the building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a four-block radius, and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings. The broken glass alone accounted for five percent of the death total and 69 percent of the injuries outside the Murrah Federal Building. The blast destroyed or burned 86 cars around the site. The destruction of the buildings left several hundred people homeless and shut down several offices in downtown Oklahoma City. The explosion was estimated to have caused at least $652 million worth of damage.

The effects of the blast were equivalent to over of TNT, and could be heard and felt up to away. Seismometers at the Omniplex Science Museum in Oklahoma City, away, and in Norman, Oklahoma, away, recorded the blast as measuring approximately 3.0 on the Richter magnitude scale.

The collapse of the northern half of the building took roughly seven seconds. As the truck exploded, it first destroyed the column next to it, designated as G20, and shattered the entire glass facade of the building. The shockwave of the explosion forced the lower floors upwards, before the fourth and fifth floors collapsed onto the third floor, which housed a transfer beam that ran the length of the building and was being supported by four pillars below, as well as supporting the pillars that hold the upper floors. The added weight meant that the third floor gave way along with the transfer beam, which in turn caused the collapse of the building.

===Arrests===
Initially, the FBI had three hypotheses about responsibility for the bombing: international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing; a drug cartel, carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents in the building&#x27;s DEA office; and anti-government radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.
McVeigh was arrested within 90 minutes of the explosion, as he was traveling north on Interstate 35 near Perry in Noble County, Oklahoma. Oklahoma State Trooper Charlie Hanger stopped McVeigh for driving his yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis without a license plate, and arrested him for having a concealed weapon. For his home address, McVeigh falsely claimed he resided at Terry Nichols&#x27;s brother James&#x27;s house in Michigan. After booking McVeigh into jail, Trooper Hanger searched his patrol car and found a business card which had been concealed by McVeigh after being handcuffed. Written on the back of the card, which was from a Wisconsin military surplus store, were the words &quot;TNT at $5 a stick. Need more.&quot; The card was later used as evidence during McVeigh&#x27;s trial.

While investigating the VIN on an axle of the truck used in the explosion and the remnants of the license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. McGown noted, &quot;People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use. That&#x27;s what [McVeigh] did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him.&quot;
After an April 21, 1995, court hearing on the gun charges, but before McVeigh&#x27;s release, federal agents took him into custody as they continued their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off by the arrival of police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. McVeigh&#x27;s requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, but authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.

Federal agents obtained a warrant to search the house of McVeigh&#x27;s father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned that he was being hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of &quot;Hunter&quot; (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh&#x27;s getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32 days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh&#x27;s sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing ammunition to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.

A Jordanian-American man traveling from his home in Oklahoma City to visit family in Jordan on April 19, 1995, was detained and questioned by the FBI at the airport. Several Arab-American groups criticized the FBI for racial profiling, and the subsequent media coverage for publicizing the man&#x27;s name. Attorney General Reno denied claims that the federal government relied on racial profiling, while FBI director Louis J. Freeh told a press conference that the man was never a suspect, and was instead treated as a &quot;witness&quot; to the Oklahoma City bombing, who assisted the government&#x27;s investigation.

==Casualties==

An estimated 646 people were inside the building when the bomb exploded. By the end of the day, 14 adults and six children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168 confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, and a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building. A rescue worker was indirectly killed after the bombing, after he was struck on the head by debris during rescue efforts, and is not counted in the direct death toll of the bombing.

The victims ranged in age from three months to 73 years and included three pregnant women. Of the dead, 108 worked for the Federal government: Drug Enforcement Administration (5); Secret Service (6); Department of Housing and Urban Development (35); Department of Agriculture (7); Customs Office (2); Department of Transportation/Federal Highway Administration (11); General Services Administration (2); and the Social Security Administration (40). Eight of the federal government victims were federal law enforcement agents. Of those law enforcement agents, four were members of the U.S. Secret Service; two were members of the U.S. Customs Service; one was a member of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and one was a member of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Six of the victims were U.S. military personnel; two were members of the U.S. Army; two were members of the U.S. Air Force, and two were members of the U.S. Marine Corps. The victims also included 19 children, of whom 15 were in the America&#x27;s Kids Day Care Center. The bodies of the 168 victims were identified at a temporary morgue set up at the scene. A team of 24 identified the victims using full-body X-rays, dental examinations, fingerprinting, blood tests, and DNA testing. More than 680 people were injured. The majority of the injuries were abrasions, severe burns, and bone fractures.

McVeigh later acknowledged the casualties, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t define the rules of engagement in this conflict. The rules, if not written down, are defined by the aggressor. It was brutal, no holds barred. Women and kids were killed at Waco and Ruby Ridge. You put back in [the government&#x27;s] faces exactly what they&#x27;re giving out.&quot; He later stated, &quot;I wanted the government to hurt like the people of Waco and Ruby Ridge had.&quot;

==Response and relief==

===Rescue efforts===

At 9:03 a.m., the first of over 1,800 911 calls related to the bombing were received by Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA). By that time, EMSA ambulances, police, and firefighters had heard the blast and were already headed to the scene. Nearby civilians, who had also witnessed or heard the blast, arrived to assist the victims and emergency workers. Within 23 minutes of the bombing, the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) was set up, consisting of representatives from the state departments of public safety, human services, military, health, and education. Assisting the SEOC were agencies including the National Weather Service, the Air Force, the Civil Air Patrol, and the American Red Cross. Immediate assistance also came from 465 members of the Oklahoma National Guard, who arrived within the hour to provide security, and from members of the Department of Civil Emergency Management. Terrance Yeakey and Jim Ramsey, from the Oklahoma City Police Department, were among the first officers to arrive at the site.

The EMS command post was set up almost immediately following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and decontamination. A simple plan/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle a large number of patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner&#x27;s office, and measures for a long-term medical operation needed to be established. The triage center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there. Two hundred and ten patients were transported from the primary triage center to nearby hospitals within the first couple of hours following the bombing.

Within the first hour, 50 people were rescued from the Murrah Federal Building. The injured were sent to every hospital in the area. The day of the bombing, 153 people were treated at St. Anthony Hospital, eight blocks from the blast, over 70 people were treated at Presbyterian Hospital, 41 people were treated at University Hospital, and 18 people were treated at Children&#x27;s Hospital. Temporary silences were observed at the blast site so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heartbeats could be used to locate survivors. In some cases, limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics (avoided because of the potential to induce shock) in order to free those trapped under rubble. The scene had to be periodically evacuated as the police received tips claiming that other bombs had been planted in the building.

At 10:28 a.m., rescuers found what they believed to be a second bomb. Some rescue workers refused to leave until police ordered the evacuation of a four-block area around the site. The device was determined to be a three-foot (.9-m) long TOW missile used in the training of federal agents and bomb-sniffing dogs; although inert, it had been marked &quot;live&quot; in order to mislead arms traffickers in a planned law enforcement sting. On examination the missile was determined to be inert, and relief efforts resumed 45 minutes later. The last survivor, a 15-year-old girl found under the base of the collapsed building, was rescued at around 7 p.m.

In the days following the blast, over 12,000 people participated in relief and rescue operations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, bringing in 665 rescue workers. One nurse was killed in the rescue attempt after she was hit on the head by debris, and 26 other rescuers were hospitalized because of various injuries. Twenty-four K-9 units and out-of-state dogs were brought in to search for survivors and bodies in the building debris. In an effort to recover additional bodies, of rubble were removed from the site each day from April 24 to 29.
Rescue and recovery efforts were concluded at 12:05 a.m. on May 5, by which time the bodies of all but three of the victims had been recovered. For safety reasons, the building was initially slated to be demolished shortly afterward. McVeigh&#x27;s attorney, Stephen Jones, filed a motion to delay the demolition until the defense team could examine the site in preparation for the trial. At 7:02 a.m. on May 23, more than a month after the bombing, the Murrah Federal building was demolished. The EMS Command Center remained active and was staffed 24 hours a day until the demolition. The final three bodies to be recovered were those of two credit union employees and a customer. For several days after the building&#x27;s demolition, trucks hauled away of debris a day from the site. Some of the debris was used as evidence in the conspirators&#x27; trials, incorporated into memorials, donated to local schools, or sold to raise funds for relief efforts.

===Humanitarian aid===
The national humanitarian response was immediate, and in some cases even overwhelming. Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows, bottled water, helmet lights, knee pads, rain gear, and even football helmets were donated. The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop-off centers were set up to accept and sort the goods. The Oklahoma Restaurant Association, which was holding a trade show in the city, assisted rescue workers by providing 15,000 to 20,000 meals over ten days.

The Salvation Army served over 100,000 meals and provided over 100,000 ponchos, gloves, hard hats, and knee pads to rescue workers. Local residents and those from further afield responded to the requests for blood donations. Of the over 9,000 units of blood donated, 131 were used; the rest were stored in blood banks.

===Federal and state government aid===

At 9:45 a.m., Governor Frank Keating declared a state of emergency and ordered all non-essential workers in the Oklahoma City area to be released from their duties for their safety. President Bill Clinton learned about the bombing at around 9:30 a.m. while he was meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Çiller at the White House. Before addressing the nation, President Clinton considered grounding all planes in the Oklahoma City area to prevent the bombers from escaping by air, but decided against it. At 4:00 p.m., President Clinton declared a federal emergency in Oklahoma City and spoke to the nation:

He ordered that flags for all federal buildings be flown at half-staff for 30 days in remembrance of the victims. Four days later, on April 23, 1995, Clinton spoke from Oklahoma City.

No major federal financial assistance was made available to the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing, but the Murrah Fund set up in the wake of the bombing attracted over $300,000 in federal grants. Over $40 million was donated to the city to aid disaster relief and to compensate the victims. Funds were initially distributed to families who needed it to get back on their feet, and the rest was held in trust for longer-term medical and psychological needs. By 2005, $18 million of the donations remained, some of which was earmarked to provide a college education for each of the 219 children who lost one or both parents in the bombing. A committee chaired by Daniel Kurtenbach of Goodwill Industries provided financial assistance to the survivors.

===International reaction===
International reactions to the bombing varied. President Clinton received many messages of sympathy, including those from Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and P. V. Narasimha Rao of India. Other condolences came from Russia, Canada, Australia, the United Nations, and the European Union, among other nations and organizations.

Several countries offered to assist in both the rescue efforts and the investigation. France offered to send a special rescue unit, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin offered to send agents with anti-terrorist expertise to help in the investigation. President Clinton declined Israel&#x27;s offer, believing that accepting it would increase anti-Muslim sentiments and endanger Muslim-Americans.

===Children affected===

In the wake of the bombing, the national media focused on the fact that 19 of the victims had been babies and children, many in the day-care center. At the time of the bombing, there were 100 day-care centers in the United States in 7,900 federal buildings. McVeigh later stated that he was unaware of the day-care center when choosing the building as a target, and if he had known &quot;... it might have given me pause to switch targets. That&#x27;s a large amount of collateral damage.&quot; The FBI stated that McVeigh scouted the interior of the building in December 1994 and likely knew of the day-care center before the bombing. This was corroborated by Nichols, who said that he and McVeigh did know about the daycare center in the building, and that they did not care. In April 2010, Joseph Hartzler, the prosecutor at McVeigh&#x27;s trial, questioned how McVeigh could have decided to pass over a prior target building because of a florist shop but at the Murrah building, not &quot;... notice that there&#x27;s a child day-care center there, that there was a credit union there and a Social Security office?&quot;

Schools across the country were dismissed early and ordered closed. A photograph of firefighter Chris Fields emerging from the rubble with infant Baylee Almon, who later died in a nearby hospital, was reprinted worldwide and became a symbol of the attack. The photo, taken by bank employee Charles H. Porter IV, won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and appeared on newspapers and magazines for months following the attack.
Aren Almon Kok, mother of Baylee Almon, said of the photo, &quot;It was very hard to go to stores because they are in the check out aisle. It was always there. It was devastating. Everybody had seen my daughter dead. And that&#x27;s all she became to them. She was a symbol. She was the girl in the fireman&#x27;s arms. But she was a real person that got left behind.&quot;

The images and media reports of children dying terrorized many children who, as demonstrated by later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern in the mental health response to the bombing and many bomb-related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of middle and high school students conducted seven weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students who had no connection or relationship to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, as contrasted to those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who had post-traumatic stress disorder.

Children were also affected through the loss of parents in the bombing. Many children lost one or both parents in the blast, with seven children losing their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally. One orphan who was interviewed (of the at least ten orphaned children) reported sleepless nights and an obsession with death.

President Clinton stated that after seeing images of babies being pulled from the wreckage, he was &quot;beyond angry&quot; and wanted to &quot;put [his] fist through the television&quot;. Clinton and his wife Hillary requested that aides talk to child care specialists about how to communicate with children about the bombing. Clinton said to the nation three days after the bombing, &quot;I don&#x27;t want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing ... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood and we are going to get through this&quot;. On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40 federal agency employees and their children, and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast, addressed their concerns.

===Media coverage===
Hundreds of news trucks and members of the press arrived at the site to cover the story. The press immediately noticed that the bombing took place on the second anniversary of the Waco incident.

Many initial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Muslim terrorists, such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Some media reported that investigators wanted to question men of Middle Eastern appearance. Hamzi Moghrabi, chairman of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, blamed the media for harassment of Muslims and Arabs that took place after the bombing.

As the rescue effort wound down, the media interest shifted to the investigation, arrests, and trials of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, and on the search for an additional suspect named &quot;John Doe Number Two.&quot; Several witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect, who did not resemble Nichols, with McVeigh.

Those who expressed sympathy for McVeigh typically described his deed as an act of war, as in the case of Gore Vidal&#x27;s essay &quot;The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh&quot;.

==Trials and sentencing of the conspirators==

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) led the official investigation, known as OKBOMB, with Weldon L. Kennedy acting as special agent in charge. Kennedy oversaw 900 federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel, including 300 FBI agents, 200 officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department, 125 members of the Oklahoma National Guard, and 55 officers from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. The crime task force was deemed the largest since the investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy. OKBOMB was the largest criminal case in America&#x27;s history, with FBI agents conducting 28,000 interviews, amassing of evidence, and collecting nearly one billion pieces of information. Federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ordered that the venue for the trial be moved from Oklahoma City to Denver, Colorado, ruling that the defendants would be unable to receive a fair trial in Oklahoma. The investigation led to the separate trials and convictions of McVeigh, Nichols and Fortier.

===Timothy McVeigh===

Opening statements in McVeigh&#x27;s trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh&#x27;s motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia&#x27;s ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137 witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh&#x27;s sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh&#x27;s hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael Fortier revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori Fortier testified that she had created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.

McVeigh was represented by a team of six principal attorneys, led by Stephen Jones. According to law professor Douglas O. Linder, McVeigh wanted Jones to present a &quot;necessity defense&quot;—which would argue that he was in &quot;imminent danger&quot; from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents). McVeigh argued that &quot;imminent&quot; does not mean &quot;immediate&quot;: &quot;If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it&#x27;s out past the orbit of Pluto, it&#x27;s not an immediate threat to Earth, but it is an imminent threat.&quot; Despite McVeigh&#x27;s wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution&#x27;s case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspiracy, and sought to present him as &quot;the designated patsy&quot;, but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible. In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks. Jones presented 25 witnesses, including Frederic Whitehurst, over a one-week period. Although Whitehurst described the FBI&#x27;s sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated.

A key point of contention in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined to belong to Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy&#x27;s coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine its owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe No. 2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.

Numerous damaging leaks, which appeared to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial. A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency&#x27;s explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.

The jury deliberated for 23 hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh was found guilty on 11 counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced sentence of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000 documents to McVeigh&#x27;s defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. McVeigh invited conductor David Woodard to perform pre-requiem Mass music on the eve of his execution; while reproachful of McVeigh&#x27;s capital wrongdoing, Woodard consented. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the president must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11, 2001. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh&#x27;s execution was the first federal execution in 38 years.

===Terry Nichols===

Nichols stood trial twice. He was first tried by the federal government in 1997, and found guilty of conspiring to build a weapon of mass destruction and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998, to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161 counts of first-degree murder (160 non-federal-agent victims and one fetus). On May 26, 2004, the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161 consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip from Gregory Scarpa Jr., searched a buried crawl space in Nichols&#x27;s former house, and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.

===Michael and Lori Fortier===
Michael and Lori Fortier were considered accomplices for their foreknowledge of the planning of the bombing. In addition to Michael Fortier&#x27;s assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori Fortier had helped McVeigh laminate the fake driver&#x27;s license that was later used to rent the Ryder truck. Michael Fortier agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998, to 12 years in prison, and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack. On January 20, 2006, Fortier was released from prison, transferred into the Witness Protection Program, and given a new identity.

===Others===
No &quot;John Doe #2&quot; was ever identified, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh&#x27;s and Nichols&#x27;s trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: &quot;You can&#x27;t handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn&#x27;t it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?&quot; On the morning of McVeigh&#x27;s execution a letter was released in which he had written &quot;For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else. Financing? Logistics? Specialized tech skills? Brainpower? Strategy? ... Show me where I needed a dark, mysterious &#x27;Mr. X&#x27;!&quot;

==Aftermath==
Within 48 hours of the attack, and with the assistance of the General Services Administration (GSA), the targeted federal offices were able to resume operations in other parts of the city. According to Mark Potok, director of Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, his organization tracked another 60 domestic smaller-scale terrorism plots from 1995 to 2005. Several of the plots were uncovered and prevented while others caused various infrastructure damage, deaths, or other destruction. Potok revealed that in 1996 there were approximately 858 domestic militias and other antigovernment groups but the number had dropped to 152 by 2004. Shortly after the bombing, the FBI hired an additional 500 agents to investigate potential domestic terrorist attacks. A 2005 Federal Bureau of Investigation report said the bombing &quot;brought the threat of right-wing terrorism to the forefront of American law enforcement attention.&quot; 

===Legislation===
In the wake of the bombing, the U.S. government enacted several pieces of legislation including the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997, by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings. In response to passing the legislation, Clinton stated that &quot;when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process, not on the outside looking in.&quot;

In the years since the bombing, scientists, security experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.

===Oklahoma school curriculum===
In the decade following the bombing, there was criticism of Oklahoma public schools for not requiring the bombing to be covered in the curriculum of Oklahoma history classes. Oklahoma History is a one-semester course required by state law for graduation from high school, but the bombing was only covered for one to two pages at most in textbooks. The state&#x27;s PASS standards (Priority Academic Student Skills) did not require that a student learn about the bombing, and focused more on other subjects such as corruption and the Dust Bowl. On April 6, 2010, House Bill 2750 was signed by Governor Brad Henry, requiring the bombing to be entered into the school curriculum for Oklahoma, U.S. and world history classes.

On the signing, Governor Henry said, &quot;Although the events of April 19, 1995, may be etched in our minds and in the minds of Oklahomans who remember that day, we have a generation of Oklahomans that has little to no memory of the events of that day ... We owe it to the victims, the survivors and all of the people touched by this tragic event to remember April 19, 1995, and understand what it meant and still means to this state and this nation.&quot;

===Building security and construction===

In the weeks following the bombing, the federal government ordered that all federal buildings in all major cities be surrounded with prefabricated Jersey barriers to prevent similar attacks. As part of a longer-term plan for United States federal building security, most of those temporary barriers have since been replaced with permanent and more aesthetically considerate security barriers, which are driven deep into the ground for sturdiness. All new federal buildings must now be constructed with truck-resistant barriers and with deep setbacks from surrounding streets to minimize their vulnerability to truck bombs. FBI buildings, for instance, must be set back from traffic. The total cost of improving security in federal buildings across the country in response to the bombing reached over $600 million.

The Murrah Federal Building had been considered so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued &quot;Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities&quot;, also known as &quot;The Marshals Report&quot;, the findings of which resulted in a thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300 federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52 security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.

The attack led to engineering improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces, improvements which were incorporated into the design of Oklahoma City&#x27;s new federal building. The National Geographic Channel documentary series &quot;Seconds From Disaster&quot; suggested that the Murrah Federal Building would probably have survived the blast had it been built according to California&#x27;s earthquake design codes.

===Drag racing===
The National Hot Rod Association has tightened its regulations for nitromethane. Section 21 of the current NHRA rule book states nitromethane is limited to , or in a barrel, instead of the normal . The NHRA requires competitors to submit a Top Screen Questionnaire to the Department of Homeland Security. In addition, competitors are not allowed to own nitromethane at official events. Instead, it must be stored at the series&#x27; official fuel supplier, VP Racing Fuel (as of 2025). 

Each time a team purchases nitromethane, it is logged by the Series fuel supplier, which dispenses the correct amount of nitromethane ordered to the specific team. At the end of the event, unused nitromethane is returned to the Series fuel supplier and logged with volume remaining of nitromethane that team has purchased but has not used that will available to use at the next event (qualifying sessions, for example) before purchasing more nitromethane. LeSueur, who twice rejected selling nitromethane to McVeigh, explained, &quot;It’s all part of &#x27;a paper trail of where all this stuff is&#x27;.&quot; 

In 2008, the NHRA fined Don Schumacher $100,000 for violation of security protocol when drums of nitromethane from a supplier other than the series&#x27; then-specification supplier were found in his teams&#x27; pit area at the spring Las Vegas Motor Speedway round, in violation of the NHRA&#x27;s rules on specification nitromethane (including being required to be stored at the series&#x27; fuel supplier) and Department of Homeland Security policy regarding ownership of nitromethane.

===Impact according to McVeigh===
McVeigh believed that the bomb attack had a positive impact on government policy. In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996, the government&#x27;s $3.1 million settlement with Randy Weaver and his surviving children four months after the bombing, and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound. McVeigh stated, &quot;Once you bloody the bully&#x27;s nose, and he knows he&#x27;s going to be punched again, he&#x27;s not coming back around.&quot;

==Evacuation issues==
Several agencies, including the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City, have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing and have proposed plans for a better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets and the number of response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.

After the September 11 attacks in 2001, with consideration of other events, including the Oklahoma City bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter disaster areas more quickly. By helping civilians get out and rescue workers get in, casualties would hopefully be decreased.

==Memorial observances==

===Oklahoma City National Memorial===

For two years after the bombing the only memorials to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding the site of the building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350 members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing. On July 1, 1997, the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624 submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29 million, which was raised by public and private funds. The national memorial is part of the National Park System as an affiliated area and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg. It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years after the bombing. Within the first year, it had 700,000 visitors.

The memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates, one inscribed with the time 9:01, the other with 9:03, the pool representing the moment of the blast. On the south end of the memorial is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs—one for each person lost, arranged according to what floor of the building they were on. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims&#x27; families. The seats of the children killed are smaller than those of the adults lost. On the opposite side is the &quot;survivor tree&quot;, part of the building&#x27;s original landscaping that survived the blast and fires that followed it. The memorial left part of the foundation of the building intact, allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction. Part of the chain link fence put in place around the site of the blast, which had attracted over 800,000 personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation, is now on the western edge of the memorial. North of the memorial is the Journal Record Building, which now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, an affiliate of the National Park Service. The building also contained the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, a law enforcement training center.

===St. Joseph&#x27;s Old Cathedral===
St. Joseph&#x27;s Old Cathedral, one of the first brick-and-mortar churches in the city, is located to the southwest of the memorial and was severely damaged by the blast. To commemorate the event, a statue and sculpture work entitled &quot;And Jesus Wept&quot; was installed adjacent to the Oklahoma City National Memorial. The work was dedicated in May 1997 and the church was rededicated on December 1 of the same year. The church, the statue, and the sculpture are not part of the Oklahoma City memorial.

===Remembrance observance===
An observance is held each year to remember the victims of the bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24 days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02 a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168 seconds of silence—one second for each person who was killed as a result of the blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.

Vice President Dick Cheney, former President Clinton, Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry, Frank Keating, Governor of Oklahoma at the time of the bombing, and other political dignitaries attended the service and gave speeches in which they emphasized that &quot;goodness overcame evil&quot;. The relatives of the victims and the survivors of the blast also made note of it during the service at First United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City.

President George W. Bush made note of the anniversary in a written statement, part of which echoed his remarks on the execution of Timothy McVeigh in 2001: &quot;For the survivors of the crime and for the families of the dead the pain goes on.&quot; Bush was invited but did not attend the service because he was en route to Springfield, Illinois, to dedicate the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. Cheney attended the service in his place.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the memorial site was closed to the public on April 19, 2020, and local television networks broadcast pre-recorded remembrances to mark the 25th anniversary.

<doc id="22468" wikidata="Q1317" url="?curid=22468" title="Osama bin Laden">
<text>Osama bin Laden (10 March 19572 May 2011) was a Saudi Arabian–born Islamist dissident and militant leader who was the founder and first general emir of al-Qaeda. Ideologically a pan-Islamist, Bin Laden participated in the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet Union, and supported the Bosnian mujahideen during the Yugoslav Wars. Opposed to the United States&#x27; foreign policy in the Middle East, Bin Laden declared war on the U.S. in 1996 and advocated attacks targeting US assets in various countries, and supervised the execution of the September 11 attacks inside the U.S. in 2001.Bin Laden was born in Riyadh to the aristocratic bin Laden family. He studied at Saudi and foreign universities until 1979, when he joined the mujahideen fighting against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1984, he co-founded Maktab al-Khidamat, which recruited foreign mujahideen into the war. Bin Laden was an influential ideologue who inspired several Islamist organizations. To many Islamists, he was a war hero for helping defend Afghanistan, and a voice of opposition against Western imperialism. He founded al-Qaeda in 1988 for worldwide &quot;jihad&quot;. In the Gulf War, Bin Laden&#x27;s offer for support against Iraq was rebuked by the Saudi royal family, which instead sought American aid. 

Bin Laden&#x27;s views on pan-Islamism and anti-Americanism resulted in his expulsion from Saudi Arabia in 1991. He shifted his headquarters to Sudan until 1996, when he established a new base in Afghanistan, where he was supported by the Taliban. Bin Laden declared two &quot;fatāwā&quot; in August 1996 and February 1998, declaring holy war against the U.S. After the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa, he was indicted by a U.S. district court and listed on the FBI&#x27;s Most Wanted Terrorists and Most Wanted Fugitives lists. In October 1999, the United Nations designated al-Qaeda as a terrorist organization. 

In the U.S., Bin Laden is a symbol of terrorism and mass murder, reviled for his justification and orchestration of attacks against Americans. He organized the September 11 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. This resulted in the U.S. invading Afghanistan and launching the war on terror. Bin Laden became the subject of a nearly decade-long international manhunt led by the U.S. During this period, he hid in the mountains of Afghanistan and later escaped to neighboring Pakistan. On 2 May 2011, Bin Laden was killed by U.S. special operations forces at his compound in Abbottabad. His corpse was buried in the Arabian Sea and he was succeeded by his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri on 16 June 2011.

== Name ==

Bin Laden&#x27;s name is most frequently rendered as &quot;Osama bin Laden&quot;. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as other U.S. governmental agencies, have used either &quot;Usama bin Laden&quot; or the accepted transliteration &quot;Usama bin Ladin&quot;.

Osama bin Laden&#x27;s full name, Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, means &quot;Osama, son of Mohammed, son of Awad, son of Laden&quot;. &quot;Mohammed&quot; refers to Bin Laden&#x27;s father Mohammed bin Laden; &quot;Awad&quot; refers to his grandfather, Awad bin Aboud bin Laden, a Kindite Hadhrami tribesman. Aboud&#x27;s father was Ali, whose father was Omar. The family includes many individuals over a number of generations.

He was named , meaning &quot;lion&quot;, after Usama ibn Zayd, one of the companions of Muhammad. Osama bin Laden had assumed the (teknonym) , meaning &quot;father of Abdallah&quot; The Arabic linguistic convention would be to refer to him as &quot;Osama&quot; or &quot;Osama bin Laden&quot;, not &quot;Bin Laden&quot; alone, as &quot;Bin Laden&quot; is a patronymic, not a surname in the Western manner. According to one of his sons Omar, the family&#x27;s hereditary surname is , but Bin Laden&#x27;s father, Muhammad bin Ladin, never officially registered the name.

== Early life and education ==

Osama bin Laden was born on 10 March 1957 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. His father was Muhammad bin Ladin, a billionaire construction magnate with close ties to the Saudi royal family, and his mother was Mohammed bin Laden&#x27;s tenth wife, Syrian Hamida al-Attas (then called Alia Ghanem). Despite it being generally accepted that Bin Laden was born in Riyadh, his birthplace was listed as Jeddah in the initial FBI and Interpol documents.

Mohammed bin Laden divorced Hamida soon after Osama bin Laden was born. Mohammed recommended Hamida to Mohammed al-Attas, an associate. Al-Attas married Hamida in the late 1950s or early 1960s. The couple had four children, and Bin Laden lived in the new household with three half-brothers and one half-sister. The Bin Laden family made $5 billion in the construction industry, of which Osama later inherited around $25–30 million.

Bin Laden was raised as a devout Sunni Muslim. From 1968 to 1976, he attended the elite Al-Thager Model School. Bin Laden attended an English-language course in Oxford, England, during 1971. He studied economics and business administration at King Abdulaziz University. Some reports suggest he earned a degree in civil engineering in 1979, or a degree in public administration in 1981. One source described him as &quot;hard working&quot;; another said he left university during his third year without completing a college degree.

At university, Bin Laden&#x27;s main interest was religion, where he was involved in both &quot;interpreting the Quran and &quot;jihad&quot;&quot; and charitable work. Other interests included writing poetry; reading, with the works of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and Charles de Gaulle said to be among his favorites; black stallions; and association football, in which he enjoyed playing at centre forward and followed the English club Arsenal. During his studies in Jeddah, Bin Laden became a pupil of the influential Islamist scholar Abdullah Yusuf Azzam and avidly read his treatises. He also read the writings of several Muslim Brotherhood leaders and was highly influenced by the Islamic revolutionary ideas advocated by Sayyid Qutb.

== Personal life ==

At age 17 in 1974, Bin Laden married Najwa Ghanem at Latakia, Syria; but they were later separated and she left Afghanistan on 9 September 2001, 2 days before the 9/11 attacks. His other known wives were Khadijah Sharif (married 1983, divorced 1990s); Khairiah Sabar (married 1985); Siham Sabar (married 1987); and Amal al-Sadah (married 2000). Some sources also list a sixth wife, name unknown, whose marriage to Bin Laden was annulled soon after the ceremony. Bin Laden fathered between 20 and 26 children with his wives. Many of Bin Laden&#x27;s children fled to Iran following the September 11 attacks and , Iranian authorities reportedly continue to control their movements.

Nasser al-Bahri, who was Bin Laden&#x27;s personal bodyguard from 1997 to 2001, details Bin Laden&#x27;s personal life in his memoir. He describes him as a frugal man and strict father, who enjoyed taking his large family on shooting trips and picnics in the desert.

Bin Laden&#x27;s father Mohammed died in 1967 in an airplane crash in Saudi Arabia when his American pilot Jim Harrington misjudged a landing. Bin Laden&#x27;s eldest half-brother, Salem bin Laden, the subsequent head of the Bin Laden family, was killed in 1988 near San Antonio, Texas, in the U.S., when he accidentally flew a plane into power lines.

The FBI described Bin Laden as an adult as tall and thin, between and in height and weighing about , although author Lawrence Wright, in his book on al-Qaeda, &quot;The Looming Tower&quot;, writes that a number of Bin Laden&#x27;s close friends confirmed that reports of his height were greatly exaggerated, and that he was actually &quot;just over tall&quot;. After his death, he was measured to be roughly . Bin Laden had an olive complexion and was left-handed, usually walking with a cane. He wore a plain white keffiyeh. At one point, he stopped wearing the traditional Saudi male keffiyeh and instead wore the traditional Yemeni male keffiyeh. He was described as soft-spoken and mild-mannered in demeanor.

== Political views ==

According to former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer, who led the CIA&#x27;s hunt for Bin Laden, Bin Laden was motivated by a belief that U.S. foreign policy has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East. As such, the threat to U.S. national security arises not from al-Qaeda being offended by what the U.S. is but rather by what the U.S. does, or in the words of Scheuer, &quot;They (al-Qaeda) hate us (Americans) for what we do, not who we are.&quot; Nonetheless, Bin Laden criticized the U.S. for its secular form of governance, calling upon Americans to convert to Islam and reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling, and usury, in a letter published in late 2002.

Bin Laden believed that the Islamic world was in crisis and that the complete restoration of Sharia law would be the only way to set things right in the Muslim world. He opposed such alternatives as secular government, as well as pan-Arabism, socialism, communism, and democracy. He subscribed to the Athari (literalist) school of Islamic theology.

These beliefs, in conjunction with violent &quot;jihad&quot;, have sometimes been called Qutbism after being promoted by Sayyid Qutb. Bin Laden believed that Afghanistan, under the rule of Mullah Omar&#x27;s Taliban, was &quot;the only Islamic country&quot; in the Muslim world. Bin Laden consistently dwelt on the need for violent &quot;jihad&quot; to right what he believed were injustices against Muslims perpetrated by the U.S. and sometimes by other non-Muslim states. In his &quot;Letter to the American People&quot; published in 2002, Bin Laden described the formation of the Israeli state as &quot;a crime which must be erased&quot; and demanded that the United States withdraw all of its civilians and military personnel from the Arabian Peninsula, as well as from all Muslim lands.

His viewpoints and methods of achieving them had led to him being designated as a terrorist by scholars; journalists from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the BBC, and Qatari news station Al Jazeera; and analysts such as Peter Bergen, Michael Scheuer, Marc Sageman, and Bruce Hoffman. He was indicted on terrorism charges by law enforcement agencies in Madrid, New York City, and Tripoli.

Bin Laden supported the targeting of American civilians, in retaliation against U.S. troops indiscriminately attacking Muslims. He asserted that this policy could deter U.S. troops from targeting Muslim women and children. Furthermore, he argued that all Americans were complicit in the crimes of their government due to majority of them electing it to power and paying taxes that fund the U.S. military. According to Noah Feldman, Bin Laden&#x27;s assertion was that &quot;since the United States is a democracy, all citizens bear responsibility for its government&#x27;s actions, and civilians are therefore fair targets.&quot;

Two months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Bin Laden stated during an interview with Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir:&quot;According to my information, if the enemy occupies an Islamic land and uses its people as human shields, a person has the right to attack the enemy. ... The targets of September 11 were not women and children. The main targets were the symbol of the United States: their economic and military power. Our Prophet Muhammad was against the killing of women and children. When he saw the body of a non-Muslim woman during a war, he asked what the reason for killing her was. If a child is older than thirteen and bears arms against Muslims, killing him is permissible.&quot;Bin Laden&#x27;s overall strategy for achieving his goals against much larger enemies such as the Soviet Union and U.S. was to lure them into a long war of attrition in Muslim countries, attracting large numbers of jihadists who would never surrender. He believed this would lead to economic collapse of the enemy countries, by &quot;bleeding&quot; them dry. Al-Qaeda manuals express this strategy. In a 2004 tape broadcast by Al Jazeera, Bin Laden spoke of &quot;bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy&quot;.

A number of errors and inconsistencies in Bin Laden&#x27;s arguments have been alleged by authors such as Max Rodenbeck and Noah Feldman. He invoked democracy both as an example of the deceit and fraudulence of Western political system—American law being &quot;the law of the rich and wealthy&quot;—and as the reason civilians are responsible for their government&#x27;s actions and so can be lawfully punished by death. He denounced democracy as a &quot;religion of ignorance&quot; that violates Islam by issuing man-made laws, but in a later statement compares the Western democracy of Spain favorably to the Muslim world in which the ruler is accountable. Rodenbeck states, &quot;Evidently, [Bin Laden] has never heard theological justifications for democracy, based on the notion that the will of the people must necessarily reflect the will of an all-knowing God.&quot;

Bin Laden was heavily anti-Semitic, stating that most of the negative events that occurred in the world were the direct result of Jewish actions. In a December 1998 interview with Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, Bin Laden stated that Operation Desert Fox was proof that Israeli Jews controlled the governments of the U.S. and the United Kingdom, directing them to kill as many Muslims as they could. In a letter released in late 2002, he stated that Jews controlled the civilian media outlets, politics, and economic institutions of the United States. In a May 1998 interview with ABC News, Bin Laden claimed that the Israeli state&#x27;s ultimate goal was to annex the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East into its territory and enslave its peoples, as part of what he called a &quot;Greater Israel&quot;. He stated that Jews and Muslims could never get along, that war was &quot;inevitable&quot; between them, and accusing the U.S. of stirring up anti-Islamic sentiment. He claimed that the U.S. State Department and U.S. Department of Defense were controlled by Jews, for the sole purpose of serving the Israeli state&#x27;s goals. He often delivered warnings against alleged Jewish conspiracies: &quot;These Jews are masters of usury and leaders in treachery. They will leave you nothing, either in this world or the next.&quot; Shia Muslims have been listed along with heretics, the United States, and Israel as the four principal enemies of Islam at ideology classes of Bin Laden&#x27;s al-Qaeda organization.

Bin Laden was opposed to music on religious grounds, and his attitude towards technology was mixed. He was interested in earth-moving machinery and genetic engineering of plants, while rejecting the use of chilled water. He also believed climate change to be a serious threat and penned a letter urging Americans to work with U.S. President Barack Obama to make a rational decision to &quot;save humanity from the harmful gases that threaten its destiny&quot;.

== Militant and political career ==
=== Afghan–Soviet War ===
After leaving college in 1979, Bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined Abdullah Yusuf Azzam and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the Mujahideen resistance in the Soviet—Afghan War. He later told a journalist: &quot;I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan.&quot; From 1979 to 1992, the U.S. (as part of CIA activities in Afghanistan, specifically Operation Cyclone), Saudi Arabia, and China provided between $6–12 billion worth of financial aid and weapons to tens of thousands of mujahideen through Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). 

British journalist Jason Burke wrote: &quot;[Bin Laden] did not receive any direct funding or training from the U.S. during the 1980s. Nor did his followers. The Afghan mujahideen, via Pakistan&#x27;s ISI intelligence agency, received large amounts of both. Some bled to the Arabs fighting the Soviets but nothing significant.&quot; Bin Laden met and built relations with Hamid Gul, who was a three-star general in the Pakistani Army and head of the ISI agency. Although the United States provided the money and weapons, the training of militant groups was entirely done by the Pakistan Armed Forces and the ISI. According to Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, the person in charge of the ISI&#x27;s Afghan operations at the time, it was a strict policy of Pakistan to prevent any American involvement in the distribution of funds or weapons or in the training of the mujahideen, and the CIA officials stayed in the embassy in Islamabad, never entering Afghanistan or meeting with the Afghan resistance leaders themselves. According to some CIA officers, beginning in early 1980, Bin Laden acted as a liaison between the Saudi General Intelligence Presidency (GIP) and Afghan warlords; no evidence of contact between the CIA and Bin Laden exists in the CIA archives. Steve Coll states that although Bin Laden may not have been a formal, salaried GIP agent, &quot;it seems clear that Bin Laden did have a substantial relationship with Saudi intelligence.&quot; Bin Laden&#x27;s first trainer was U.S. Special Forces commando Ali Mohamed.

By 1984, Bin Laden and Azzam established Maktab al-Khidamat, which funneled money, arms, and fighters from around the Arab world into Afghanistan. Through al-Khadamat, Bin Laden&#x27;s inherited family fortune paid for air tickets and accommodation, paid for paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihadi fighters. Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained volunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Between 1986 and 1987, Bin Laden set up a base in eastern Afghanistan for several dozen of his own Arab soldiers. From this base, Bin Laden participated in some combat activity against the Soviets, such as the Battle of Jaji in 1987. Despite its little strategic significance, the battle was lionized in the mainstream Arab press. It was during this time that he became idolized by many Arabs.

=== Allegation of involvement in 1988 Gilgit massacre ===

In May 1988, responding to rumours of a massacre of Sunnis by Shias, large numbers of Shias from in and around Gilgit, Pakistan were killed in a massacre. Shia civilians were also subjected to rape. The massacre is alleged by B. Raman, a founder of India&#x27;s Research and Analysis Wing, to have been in response to a revolt by the Shias of Gilgit during the rule of military dictator Zia-ul Haq. He alleged that the Pakistan Army induced Osama bin Laden to lead an armed group of Sunni tribals, from Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier Province, into Gilgit and its surrounding areas to suppress the revolt.

=== Formation and structuring of al-Qaeda ===
By 1988, Bin Laden had split from Maktab al-Khidamat. While Azzam acted as support for Afghan fighters, Bin Laden wanted a more military role. One of the main points leading to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was Azzam&#x27;s insistence that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force. Notes of a meeting of Bin Laden and others on 20 August 1988, indicate that al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: &quot;Basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make his religion victorious.&quot; A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (&quot;bayat&quot;) to follow one&#x27;s superiors.

According to Wright, the group&#x27;s real name was not used in public pronouncements because its existence was still a closely held secret. His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an 11 August 1988, meeting between several senior leaders of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), Azzam, and Bin Laden, where it was agreed to join Bin Laden&#x27;s money with the expertise of the EIJ and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.

Following the Soviet Union&#x27;s withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, Bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia as a hero of &quot;jihad&quot;. Along with his Arab legion, he was thought to have brought down the mighty superpower of the Soviet Union. After his return to Saudi Arabia, Bin Laden engaged in opposition movements to the Saudi monarchy while working for his family business. He offered to send al-Qaeda to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Yemeni Socialist Party government in South Yemen, but was rebuffed by Prince Turki bin Faisal. He then tried to disrupt the Yemeni unification process by assassinating YSP leaders, but was halted by Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz after President Ali Abdullah Saleh complained to King Fahd. He was also angered by the internecine tribal fighting among the Afghans. However, he continued working with the Saudi GID and the Pakistani ISI. In March 1989, Bin Laden led 800 Arab foreign fighters during the unsuccessful Battle of Jalalabad. Bin Laden led his men in person to immobilize the 7th Sarandoy Regiment but failed doing so leading to massive casualties. He funded the 1990 Afghan coup d&#x27;état attempt led by hardcore communist General Shahnawaz Tanai. He also lobbied the Parliament of Pakistan to carry out an unsuccessful motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

=== The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Gulf war===

The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait under Saddam Hussein on 2 August 1990, put the Saudi kingdom and the royal family at risk. With Iraqi forces on the Saudi border, Saddam&#x27;s appeal to pan-Arabism was potentially inciting internal dissent. One week after King Fahd agreed to U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney&#x27;s offer of American military assistance, Bin Laden met with King Fahd and Saudi Defense Minister Sultan bin Abdulaziz, telling them not to depend on non-Muslim assistance from the U.S. and others and offering to help defend Saudi Arabia with his Arab legion. When Sultan asked how Bin Laden would defend the fighters if Saddam used Iraqi chemical and biological weapons against them, he replied, &quot;We will fight him with faith.&quot; Bin Laden&#x27;s offer was rebuffed, and the Saudi monarchy invited the deployment of U.S. forces in Saudi territory.

Bin Laden publicly denounced Saudi dependence on the U.S. forces, arguing that that it was indignity that the kingdom was being defended by an army of American unbelievers. Bin Laden tried to convince the Saudi &quot;ulama&quot; to issue a fatwa condemning the American military deployment but senior clerics refused out of fear of repression. Bin Laden&#x27;s continued criticism of the Saudi monarchy led them to put him under house arrest, under which he remained until he was ultimately forced to leave the country in 1991. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division landed in the north-eastern Saudi city of Dhahran and was deployed in the desert barely 400 miles from Medina.

Meanwhile, on 8 November 1990, the FBI raided the New Jersey home of El Sayyid Nosair, an associate of al-Qaeda operative Ali Mohamed. They discovered copious evidence of terrorist plots, including plans to blow up New York City skyscrapers. This marked the earliest discovery of al-Qaeda terrorist plans outside of Muslim countries. Nosair was eventually convicted in connection to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and, years later, admitted guilt for the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York City on 5 November 1990.

=== Move to Sudan ===
In 1991, Bin Laden was expelled from Saudi Arabia by its government after repeatedly criticizing the Saudi alliance with the United States. He and his followers moved first to Afghanistan and then relocated to Sudan by 1992, in a deal brokered by Ali Mohamed. Bin Laden&#x27;s personal security detail consisted of bodyguards personally selected by him. Their arsenal included SA-7, Stinger missiles, AK-47s, RPGs, and PK machine guns. Meanwhile, in March–April 1992, Bin Laden tried to play a pacifying role in the escalating civil war in Afghanistan, by urging warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to join the other mujahideen leaders negotiating a coalition government instead of trying to conquer Kabul for himself.

It is believed that the first bombing attack involving Bin Laden was the 29 December 1992, bombing of the Gold Mihor Hotel in Aden in which two people were killed.

In the 1990s, Bin Laden&#x27;s al-Qaeda assisted jihadis financially, and sometimes militarily, in Algeria, Egypt, and Afghanistan. In 1992 or 1993, Bin Laden sent an emissary, Qari el-Said, with $40,000 to Algeria to aid the Islamists and urge war rather than negotiation with the government. Their advice was heeded. The war that followed caused the deaths of 150,000 to 200,000 Algerians and ended with the Islamists surrendering to the government.

In Sudan, Bin Laden established a new base for Mujahideen operations in Khartoum. He bought a house on Al-Mashtal Street in the affluent Al-Riyadh quarter and a retreat at Soba on the Blue Nile. During his time in Sudan, he heavily invested in the infrastructure, in agriculture and businesses. He was the Sudan agent for the British firm Hunting Surveys, and built roads using the same bulldozers he had employed to construct mountain tracks in Afghanistan. Many of his labourers were the same fighters who had been his comrades in the war against the Soviet Union. He was generous to the poor and popular with the people. He continued to criticize King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. In response, in 1994, Fahd stripped Bin Laden of his Saudi citizenship and persuaded his family to cut off his $7 million a year stipend.

By that time, Bin Laden was being linked with EIJ, which made up the core of al-Qaeda. In 1995, the EIJ attempted to assassinate the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The attempt failed, and Sudan expelled the EIJ. After this bombing, al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justification for the killing of innocent people. According to a fatwa issued by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the killing of someone standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander will find a proper reward in death, going to &quot;Jannah&quot; (paradise) if they were good Muslims and to &quot;Jahannam&quot; (hell) if they were bad or non-believers. The fatwa was issued to al-Qaeda members but not the general public.

The U.S. State Department accused Sudan of being a sponsor of international terrorism and Bin Laden of operating terrorist training camps in the Sudanese desert. However, according to Sudan officials, this stance became obsolete as the Islamist political leader Hassan al-Turabi lost influence in their country. The Sudanese wanted to engage with the U.S., but American officials refused to meet with them even after they had expelled Bin Laden. It was not until 2000 that the State Department authorized U.S. intelligence officials to visit Sudan.

The 9/11 Commission Report states:

In late 1995, when Bin Laden was still in Sudan, the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) learned that Sudanese officials were discussing with the Saudi government the possibility of expelling Bin Laden. CIA paramilitary officer Billy Waugh tracked down Bin Ladin in Sudan and prepared an operation to apprehend him, but was denied authorization. US Ambassador Timothy Carney encouraged the Sudanese to pursue this course. The Saudis, however, did not want Bin Laden, giving as their reason their revocation of his citizenship. Sudan&#x27;s minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Laden over to the United States. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Laden. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment outstanding against Bin Laden in any country.

In January 1996, the CIA launched a new unit of its Counterterrorism Center (CTC) called the Bin Laden Issue Station, code-named &quot;Alec Station&quot;, to track and to carry out operations against his activities. Bin Laden Issue Station was headed by Michael Scheuer, a veteran of the Islamic Extremism Branch of the CTC. U.S. intelligence monitored Bin Laden in Sudan using operatives to run by daily and to photograph activities at his compound, and using an intelligence safe house and signals intelligence to surveil him and to record his moves.

=== Return to Afghanistan ===
The 9/11 Commission Report states:

In February 1996, Sudanese officials began approaching officials from the United States and other governments, asking what actions of theirs might ease foreign pressure. In secret meetings with Saudi officials, Sudan offered to expel Bin Laden to Saudi Arabia and asked the Saudis to pardon him. US officials became aware of these secret discussions, certainly by March. Saudi officials apparently wanted Bin Laden expelled from Sudan. They had already revoked his citizenship, however, and would not tolerate his presence in their country. Also Bin Laden may have no longer felt safe in Sudan, where he had already escaped at least one assassination attempt that he believed to have been the work of the Egyptian or Saudi regimes, and paid for by the CIA.

Due to the increasing pressure on Sudan from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United States, Bin Laden was permitted to leave for a country of his choice. He chose to return to Jalalabad, Afghanistan aboard a chartered flight on 18 May 1996; there he forged a close relationship with Mullah Omar. The expulsion from Sudan significantly weakened Bin Laden and his organization. Some African intelligence sources have argued that the expulsion left Bin Laden without an option other than becoming a full-time radical, and that most of the 300 Afghan Arabs who left with him subsequently became terrorists. Various sources report that he lost between $20 million and $300 million in Sudan; the government seized his construction equipment, and he was forced to liquidate his businesses, land, and even his horses.

==== 1996 Declaration of war and 1998 fatwa ====

In August 1996, Bin Laden issued a &quot;fatwā&quot; titled &quot;Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places&quot;, which was published by &quot;Al-Quds Al-Arabi&quot;, a London-based newspaper. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called &quot;The Land of the Two Holy Mosques&quot; in reference to Mecca and Medina. The reference to occupation in the &quot;fatwā&quot; referred to U.S. forces based in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of controlling air space in Iraq, known as Operation Southern Watch. Despite the assurance of President George H. W. Bush to King Fahd in 1990, that all U.S. forces based in Saudi Arabia would be withdrawn once the Iraqi threat had been dealt with, by 1996 the Americans were still there. Bush cited the necessity of dealing with the remnants of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime (which Bush had chosen not to destroy). Bin Laden&#x27;s view was that &quot;the &#x27;evils&#x27; of the Middle East arose from America&#x27;s attempt to take over the region and from its support for Israel. Saudi Arabia had been turned into an American colony&quot;.

Fervently attacking American support for Israel and Saudi Arabia as well as its sanctions on Iraq, Bin Laden declared in the &quot;fatwa&quot;: &quot;Terrorising you, while you are carrying arms on our land, is a legitimate and morally demanded duty. It is a legitimate right well known to all humans and other creatures... [our] youths are different from your soldiers. Your problem will be how to convince your troops to fight, while our problem will be how to restrain our youths.. The youths hold you responsible for all of the killings and evictions of the Muslims and the violation of the sanctities, carried out by your Zionist brothers in Lebanon; you openly supplied them with arms and finance. More than 600,000 Iraqi children have died due to lack of food and medicine and as a result of the unjustifiable aggression (sanction) imposed on Iraq and its nation. The children of Iraq are our children. You, the USA, together with the Saudi regime are responsible for the shedding of the blood of these innocent children. Due to all of that, what ever treaty you have with our country is now null and void.&quot;

On 23 February 1998; Bin Laden, alongside Ayman al-Zawahiri, Ahmad Refai Taha, Shaykh Mir Hamzah and Maulana Fazlur Rahman; issued another &quot;fatwā&quot; against the U.S., calling upon Muslims to attack the country and its allies. It was entitled &quot;Declaration of the World Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders&quot;. After listing numerous acts of aggression committed by the U.S., such as the presence of American forces in the Arabian Peninsula, sanctions against Iraq, Israeli repression of Palestinians, among other things. The fatwa stated: &quot;All these American crimes and sins are a clear proclamation of war against God, his Messenger, and the Muslims. Religious scholars throughout Islamic history have agreed that &quot;Jihad&quot; is an individual duty when an enemy attacks Muslim countries. This was related by the Imam ibn Qudama in &quot;&quot;The Resource&quot;,&quot; by Imam al-Kisa&#x27;i in &quot;&quot;The Marvels&quot;,&quot; by al-Qurtubi in his exegesis, and by the Sheikh of Islam when he states in his chronicles that &quot;As for fighting to repel an enemy, which is the strongest way to defend freedom and religion, it is agreed that this is a duty. After faith, there is no greater duty than fighting an enemy who is corrupting religion and the world.&quot;&quot;

At the public announcement, Bin Laden said that North Americans are &quot;very easy targets&quot;. He told the attending journalists, &quot;You will see the results of this in a very short time.&quot; It also claimed the &quot;individual duty for every Muslim &quot;was to liberate Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem and the Grand Mosque in Mecca from their grip.
=== Late 1990s attacks ===
In Afghanistan, Bin Laden and al-Qaeda raised money from donors from the days of the Afghan &quot;jihad&quot;, and from the Pakistani ISI to establish more training camps for Mujahideen fighters. Bin Laden effectively took over Ariana Afghan Airlines, which ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash, and opium through the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, as well as provided false identifications to members of Bin Laden&#x27;s terrorist network. The arms smuggler Viktor Bout helped to run the airline, maintaining planes and loading cargo. Michael Scheuer, head of the CIA&#x27;s Bin Laden unit, concluded that Ariana was being used as a terrorist taxi service.

It has been claimed that Bin Laden funded the Luxor massacre of 17 November 1997, which killed 62 civilians, and outraged the Egyptian public. In mid-1997, the Northern Alliance threatened to overrun Jalalabad, causing him to abandon his Najim Jihad compound and move his operations to Tarnak Farms in the south.Another successful attack was carried out in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan. Bin Laden helped cement his alliance with the Taliban by sending several hundred Afghan Arab fighters along to help the Taliban kill between five and six thousand Hazaras overrunning the city.
Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri organized an al-Qaeda congress on 24 June 1998. The 1998 U.S. embassy bombings were a series of attacks that occurred on 7 August 1998, in which hundreds of people were killed in simultaneous truck bomb explosions at the U.S. embassies in the major East African cities of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. The attacks were linked to local members of the EIJ, and brought Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to the attention of the U.s. public for the first time. Al-Qaeda later claimed responsibility for the bombings.

In retaliation for the embassy bombings, U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered a series of cruise missile strikes on Bin Laden-related targets in Sudan and Afghanistan on 20 August 1998. In December 1998, the CIA reported to Clinton that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the U.S., including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft. On 7 June 1999, the FBI placed Bin Laden on its Ten Most Wanted list. On October 15, 1999, the United Nations designated al-Qaeda as a terrorist organization through UN Security Council Resolution 1267. This resolution aimed to impose sanctions on individuals and entities associated with al-Qaeda, including freezing assets and imposing travel bans.

In late 2000, Richard Clarke revealed that Islamic militants headed by Bin Laden had planned a triple attack on 3 January 2000, which would have included bombings in Jordan of the Radisson SAS Hotel in Amman, tourists at Mount Nebo, and a site on the Jordan River, as well as the sinking of the destroyer in Yemen, and an attack on a target within the United States. The plan was foiled by the arrest of the Jordanian terrorist cell, the sinking of the explosive-filled skiff intended to target the destroyer, and the arrest of Ahmed Ressam.

=== Yugoslav Wars ===

A former U.S. State Department official in October 2001 described Bosnia and Herzegovina as a safe haven for terrorists, and asserted that militant elements of the former Sarajevo government were protecting extremists, some with ties to Bin Laden.

According to Middle East intelligence reports, Bin Laden financed small convoys of recruits from the Arab world through his businesses in Sudan. Among them was Karim Said Atmani, who was identified by authorities as the document forger for a group of Algerians accused of plotting the bombings in the United States. He is a former roommate of Ahmed Ressam, the man arrested at the Canada–United States border in mid-December 1999 with a car full of nitroglycerin and bomb-making materials. He was convicted of colluding with Bin Laden by a French court.

A Bosnian government search of passport and residency records, conducted at the urging of the United States, revealed other former Mujahideen who were linked to the same Algerian group or to other groups of suspected terrorists, and had lived in the area north of Sarajevo, the capital, in the past few years. Khalil al-Deek was arrested in Jordan in late December 1999 on suspicion of involvement in a plot to blow up tourist sites. A second man with Bosnian citizenship, Hamid Aich, lived in Canada at the same time as Atmani and worked for a charity associated with Bin Laden. In its 26 June 1997 report on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that those arrested confessed to serving with Bosnian Muslim forces. Further, the captured men also admitted to ties with Bin Laden.

In 1999, the press reported that Bin Laden and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and Bosnian passports in 1993 by the government in Sarajevo. The Bosnian government denied this information following the September 11 attacks, but it was later found that Aodouni was arrested in Turkey and that at that time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation, a new explanation was given that Bin Laden did not personally collect his Bosnian passport and that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which issued the passport, could not have known who he was at the time.

The head of Albania&#x27;s State Intelligence Service (SHISH), Fatos Klosi, said that Bin Laden was running a terror network in Albania to take part in the Kosovo War under the guise of a humanitarian organization and it was reported to have been started in 1994. Claude Kader, who was a member, testified its existence during his trial. By 1998, four members of EIJ were arrested in Albania and extradited to Egypt. The mujahideen fighters were organized by Islamic leaders in Western Europe allied to him and al-Zawahiri.

During his trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević quoted from a purported FBI report that al-Qaeda had a presence in the Balkans and aided the Kosovo Liberation Army. He claimed Bin Laden had used Albania as a launchpad for violence in the region and Europe. He claimed that they had informed Richard Holbrooke that KLA was being aided by al-Qaeda but the US decided to cooperate with the KLA and thus indirectly with Osama despite the U.S. embassy bombings earlier. Milošević had argued that the U.S. aided the terrorists, which culminated in its backing of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War.

=== Criminal charges ===
On 16 March 1998, Libya issued the first official Interpol arrest warrant against Bin Laden and three other people. They were charged for killing Silvan Becker, agent of Germany&#x27;s domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, in the Terrorism Department, and his wife Vera in Libya on 10 March 1994. Bin Laden was still wanted by the Libyan government at the time of his death. He was first indicted by a grand jury of the U.S. on 8 June 1998, on a charges of conspiracy to attack defense utilities of the U.S. and prosecutors further charged that Bin Laden was the head of the terrorist organization called al-Qaeda, and that he was a major financial backer of Islamic fighters worldwide.

During the Clinton administration, capturing Bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government. Shortly after the September 11 attacks, it was revealed that Clinton had signed a directive authorizing the CIA (specifically, their elite Special Activities Division) to apprehend Bin Laden and bring him to the U.S. to stand trial for the 1998 embassy attacks; if taking him alive was deemed impossible, then deadly force was authorized. On 20 August 1998, 66 cruise missiles launched by U.S. Navy ships in the Arabian Sea struck Bin Laden&#x27;s training camps near Khost in Afghanistan, missing him by a few hours.

On 4 November 1998, Bin Laden was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on charges of &quot;Murder of US Nationals Outside the United States, Conspiracy to Murder US Nationals Outside the United States, and Attacks on a Federal Facility Resulting in Death&quot; for his alleged role in the 1998 embassy attacks. The evidence against Bin Laden included courtroom testimony by former al-Qaeda members and satellite phone records, from a phone purchased for him by al-Qaeda procurement agent Ziyad Khaleel in the U.S. However, the Taliban ruled not to extradite Bin Laden on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence published in the indictments and that non-Muslim courts lacked standing to try Muslims.

Bin Laden became the 456th person listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, when he was added on 7 June 1999, following his indictment along with others for capital crimes in the 1998 embassy attacks. Attempts at assassination and requests for the extradition of Bin Laden from the Taliban of Afghanistan were met with failure before the bombing of Afghanistan in October 2001. In 1999, US President Bill Clinton convinced the United Nations to impose sanctions against Afghanistan in an attempt to force the Taliban to extradite him.

In 1999, the CIA, together with Pakistani military intelligence, had prepared a team of approximately 60 Pakistani commandos to infiltrate Afghanistan to capture or kill Bin Laden, but the plan was aborted by the 1999 Pakistani coup d&#x27;état; in 2000, foreign operatives working on behalf of the CIA had fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a convoy of vehicles in which Bin Laden was traveling through the mountains of Afghanistan, hitting one of the vehicles but not the one in which Bin Laden was riding.

In 2000, before the September 11 attacks, Paul Bremer characterized the Clinton administration as correctly focused on Bin Laden, while Robert Oakley criticized their obsession with Osama.

=== September 11 attacks ===
U.S. president George W. Bush received an intelligence report on 6 August 2001, titled &quot;Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.&quot; On 11 September 2001 (the &quot;September 11 attacks&quot; or &quot;9/11&quot;), the U.S. was attacked by al-Qaeda, who used four commercial airplanes as missiles against various targets. Two planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. American Airlines Flight 77 was crashed into the Pentagon. United Airlines Flight 93 did not reach its intended destination, as its passengers overtook the plane, which crashed in Pennsylvania. The Twin Towers eventually collapsed. At least 2,750 people died from the attacks. 

On the day of the attacks, the National Security Agency intercepted communications that pointed to Bin Laden&#x27;s responsibility, as did German intelligence agencies. At 11:30 p.m., Bush wrote in his diary: &quot;The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today... We think it&#x27;s Osama bin Laden.&quot; The Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that classified evidence linking al-Qaeda and Bin Laden to the September 11 attacks is clear and irrefutable. The UK Government reached a similar conclusion regarding al-Qaeda and Bin Laden&#x27;s culpability for the September 11 attacks, although the government report noted that the evidence presented is not necessarily sufficient to prosecute the case. Identified motivations of the September 11 attacks include the support of Israel by the United States, presence of the U.S. military in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. enforcement of sanctions against Iraq.

Bin Laden initially denied involvement in the attacks. On 16 September 2001, he read a statement, later broadcast by Al Jazeera, denying responsibility for the attack. In a videotape recovered by U.S. forces in November 2001 in Jalalabad, Bin Laden was seen discussing the attack with Khaled al-Harbi in a way that indicates foreknowledge. The tape was broadcast on various news networks on 13 December 2001. The merits of this translation have been disputed. Arabist Dr. Abdel El M. Husseini stated: &quot;This translation is very problematic. At the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of Bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic.&quot;

In the 2004 video, Bin Laden abandoned his denials without retracting past statements. In it, he said he had personally directed the nineteen hijackers. In the 18-minute tape, played on Al-Jazeera, four days before the American presidential election, Bin Laden accused George W. Bush of negligence in the hijacking of the planes on September 11. He said was inspired to destroy the World Trade Center after watching the destruction of towers in Lebanon by Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War.

Through two other tapes aired by Al Jazeera in 2006, Bin Laden announced, &quot;I am the one in charge of the nineteen brothers. ... I was responsible for entrusting the nineteen brothers ... with the raids&quot; (23 May 2006). In the tapes, he was seen with Ramzi bin al-Shibh, as well as two of the 9/11 hijackers, Hamza al-Ghamdi and Wail al-Shehri, as they made preparations for the attacks (videotape broadcast 7 September 2006).

== Manhunt and activities after the September 11 attacks ==
=== Bush administration ===
In response to the attacks, the United States launched the war on terror to depose the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and capture al-Qaeda operatives, and several countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation to preclude future attacks. The CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division was given the lead in tracking down and killing or capturing Bin Laden. U.S. officials named Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture or death. On 13 July 2007, the Senate voted to double the reward to $50 million, although the amount was never changed. The Airline Pilots Association and the Air Transport Association offered an additional $2 million reward.

While referring to Bin Laden in a CNN film clip on 17 September 2001, then-President George W. Bush stated, &quot;I want justice. There is an old poster out west, as I recall, that said, &#x27;Wanted: Dead or alive&#x27;&quot;. Subsequently, Bin Laden retreated further from public contact to avoid capture. Numerous speculative press reports were issued about his whereabouts or even death; some placed Bin Laden in different locations during overlapping time periods.

On 10 October 2001, Bin Laden appeared as well on the initial list of the top 22 FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by the George W. Bush and based on the indictment for the 1998 embassy attack. Bin Laden was among a group of 13 fugitive terrorists wanted on that latter list for questioning about the 1998 attack. He remains the only fugitive ever to be listed on both FBI fugitive lists. Despite these multiple indictments, the Taliban refused to extradite Osama bin Laden. However, they did offer to try him before an Islamic court if evidence of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s involvement in the September 11 attacks was provided. It was not until eight days after the bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001 that the Taliban finally did offer to turn over Osama bin Laden to a third-party country for trial, in return for the U.S. ending the bombing. This offer was rejected by George W. Bush, stating that this was no longer negotiable: &quot;there&#x27;s no need to discuss innocence or guilt. We know he&#x27;s guilty.&quot;

Bin Laden was believed to be hiding in the White Mountains (Spin Ghar) in Afghanistan&#x27;s east, near the Pakistani border. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the US government concluded that Bin Laden was present during the Battle of Tora Bora, Afghanistan, in late 2001, and according to civilian and military officials with first-hand knowledge, failure by the U.S. to commit enough U.S. ground troops to hunt him led to his escape and was the gravest failure by the U.S. in the war against al-Qaeda. Intelligence officials assembled what they believed to be decisive evidence, from contemporary and subsequent interrogations and intercepted communications, that Bin Laden began the Battle of Tora Bora inside the cave complex along Afghanistan&#x27;s mountainous eastern border.

On 11 December 2005, a letter from Atiyah Abd al-Rahman to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi indicated that Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda leadership were based in the Waziristan region of Pakistan at the time. In the letter, translated by the United States military&#x27;s Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, Atiyah instructs al-Zarqawi to send messengers to Waziristan so that they meet with the brothers of the leadership. Al-Rahman also indicates that Bin Laden and al-Qaeda are weak and have many of their own problems. The letter has been deemed authentic by military and counterterrorism officials, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; also reported that the CIA unit composed of special operations paramilitary forces dedicated to capturing Bin Laden was shut down in late 2005.

U.S. and Afghanistan forces raided the mountain caves in Tora Bora between 14 and 16 August 2007. The military was drawn to the area after receiving intelligence of a pre-Ramadan meeting held by al-Qaeda members. After killing dozens of al-Qaeda and Taliban members, they did not find either Bin Laden or al-Zawahiri.

Al-Qaeda continued to release time-sensitive and professionally verified videos demonstrating Bin Laden&#x27;s continued survival, including in August 2007. He claimed sole responsibility for the September 11 attacks and specifically denied any prior knowledge of them by the Taliban or the Afghan people.

=== Obama administration ===
On 7 October 2008, in the second debate of that year&#x27;s U.S. presidential election, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama pledged, &quot;We will kill Bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaeda. That has to be our biggest national security priority.&quot; Upon being elected, Obama expressed his plans to renew and ramp up the U.S. search for Bin Laden. Obama rejected the Bush administration&#x27;s policy on Bin Laden that conflated all terror threats from al-Qaeda to Hamas to Hezbollah, replacing it with a covert, narrow focus on al-Qaeda and its direct affiliates.

In 2009, a research team led by Thomas Gillespie and John A. Agnew of UCLA used satellite-aided geographical analysis to pinpoint three compounds in Parachinar as Bin Laden&#x27;s likely hideouts. In March 2009, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that the hunt for Bin Laden had centered in the Chitral District of Pakistan, including the Kalam Valley. Author Rohan Gunaratna stated that captured al-Qaeda leaders had confirmed that Bin Laden was hiding in Chitral. Pakistan&#x27;s Prime Minister Gillani rejected claims that Osama bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan.

Early in December 2009, a Taliban detainee in Pakistan said he had information that Bin Laden was in Afghanistan that year; he said that in January or February 2009, he met a trusted contact who had seen Bin Laden in Afghanistan about 15 to 20 days earlier. However, on 6 December 2009, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that the United States had had no reliable information on the whereabouts of Bin Laden in years. On 9 December, General Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said that al-Qaeda would not be defeated unless Bin Laden were captured or killed, thus indicating that the U.S. high command believed that he was still alive. Testifying to the U.S. Congress, he said that Bin Laden had become an iconic figure, whose survival emboldens al-Qaeda as a franchising organization across the world, and that Obama&#x27;s deployment of 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan meant that success would be possible. He said killing or capturing Bin Laden would not spell the end of al-Qaeda, but the movement could not be eradicated while he remained at large.

In a 2010 letter, Bin Laden chastised followers who had reinterpreted &quot;al-tatarrus&quot;—an Islamic doctrine meant to excuse the unintended killing of non-combatants in unusual circumstances—to justify routine massacres of Muslim civilians, which had turned Muslims against the extremist movement. Of the groups affiliated with al-Qaeda, Bin Laden condemned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan for an attack on members of a hostile tribe, declaring that the operation is not justified, as there were casualties of noncombatants. Bin Laden wrote that the &quot;tatarrus&quot; doctrine needs to be revisited based on the modern-day context and clear boundaries established. He asked a subordinate to draw up a jihadist code of conduct that would constrain military operations in order to avoid civilian casualties. In Yemen, Bin Laden urged his allies to seek a truce that would bring the country stability, or would at least show the people that they were careful in keeping Muslims safe on the basis of peace. In Somalia, he called attention to the extreme poverty caused by constant warfare, and he advised al-Shabab to pursue economic development. He instructed his followers around the world to focus on education and persuasion rather than entering into confrontations with Islamic political parties.

On 2 February 2010, Afghan president Hamid Karzai arrived in Saudi Arabia for an official visit. The agenda included a discussion of a possible Saudi role in Karzai&#x27;s plan to reintegrate Taliban militants. During the visit, an anonymous official of the Saudi Foreign Affairs Ministry declared that the kingdom had no intention of getting involved in peacemaking in Afghanistan unless the Taliban severed ties with extremists and expelled Osama bin Laden. On 7 June 2010, the Kuwaiti newspaper &quot;Al-Seyassah&quot; reported that Bin Laden was hiding out in the mountainous town of Sabzevar, in northeastern Iran. On 9 June, &quot;The Australian&quot;&#x27;s online edition repeated the claim. This report turned out to be false.

On 18 October 2010, an unnamed NATO official suggested that Bin Laden was alive, well, and living comfortably in Pakistan, protected by elements of the country&#x27;s intelligence services. A senior Pakistani official denied the allegations and said that the accusations were designed to put pressure on the Pakistani government ahead of talks aimed at strengthening ties between Pakistan and the U.S.

In April 2011, various U.S. intelligence outlets traced Bin Laden to Abbottabad, Pakistan. It was previously believed that he was hiding near the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan&#x27;s Federally Administered Tribal Areas, but he was found away in a three-story mansion in Abbottabad at , southwest of the Pakistan Military Academy. Imagery from Google Earth indicates that the compound was built between 2001 and 2005.

== Death and aftermath ==


Osama bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on 2 May 2011, shortly after 1:00 AM local time (4:00 PM Eastern Time on 1 May 2011) by a U.S. military special operations unit. The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by Barack Obama in April 2011 and carried out in a CIA operation by a team of U.S. Navy SEALs from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or informally by its former name, SEAL Team Six) of the Joint Special Operations Command, with support from CIA operatives on the ground.

The raid on Bin Laden&#x27;s compound in Abbottabad was launched from Afghanistan. After the raid, reports at the time stated that U.S. forces had taken Bin Laden&#x27;s body to Afghanistan for positive identification, then buried it at sea, in accordance with Islamic law, within 24 hours of his death. Subsequent reporting has called this account into question—citing, for example, the absence of evidence that there was an imam on board the , where the burial was said to have taken place. On 15 June 2011, U.S. federal prosecutors officially dropped all criminal charges against Bin Laden.

Pakistani authorities later demolished the compound in February 2012 to prevent it from becoming a neo-Islamist shrine. In February 2013, Pakistan announced plans to build a PKR 265 million (US$30 million) amusement park in the area, including the property of the former hideout. In an interview in 2019, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan claimed that Pakistani intelligence led the CIA to Osama bin Laden.

It was widely reported by the press that Bin Laden was fatally wounded by Robert J. O&#x27;Neill; however, it has also been widely discredited by witnesses, who claim that Bin Laden was possibly already dead by the time O&#x27;Neill arrived, having been injured by an anonymous SEAL Team Six member referred to under the pseudonym &quot;Red&quot;. According to Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette, Bin Laden was struck by two suppressed shots to the side of the head from around ten feet away after leaning out of his bedroom doorway to survey Bissonnette and a point man. Once the Navy SEALs entered the bedroom, his body began convulsing and Bissonnette along with another SEAL responded by firing multiple shots into his chest.

On 29 March 2012, Pakistani newspaper &quot;Dawn&quot; acquired a report produced by Pakistani security officials, based on interrogation of his three surviving wives, that detailed his movements while living underground in Pakistan.

=== Allegations of Pakistan support and protection of Bin Laden ===
Bin Laden was killed within the fortified complex of buildings that were probably built for him, and had reportedly been his home for at least five years. The compound was located less than from Pakistan Military Academy and less than from Pakistan&#x27;s capital. While the United States and Pakistan governments both claimed, and later maintained, that no Pakistani officials, including senior military leaders, knew Bin Laden&#x27;s whereabouts or had prior knowledge of the U.S. strike, Carlotta Gall, writing in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in 2014, reported that ISI Director General Ahmad Shuja Pasha knew of Bin Laden&#x27;s presence in Abbottabad. In a 2015 &quot;London Review of Books&quot; article, investigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh asserted—citing U.S. sources—that Bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that Pasha knew of the U.S. mission in advance, and authorized the helicopters delivering the SEALs to enter Pakistani airspace; and that the CIA learned of Bin Laden&#x27;s whereabouts from a former senior Pakistani intelligence of Ahmad Shuja Pasha, who was paid an estimated $25 million for the information. Both stories were denied by U.S. and Pakistani officials.

Mosharraf Zia, a leading Pakistani columnist, stated, &quot;It seems deeply improbable that Bin Laden could have been where he was killed without the knowledge of some parts of the Pakistani state.&quot; Pakistan&#x27;s U.S. envoy, Ambassador Husain Haqqani, promised a &quot;full inquiry&quot; into how Pakistani intelligence services could have failed to find Bin Laden in a fortified compound so close to Islamabad. &quot;Obviously Bin Laden did have a support system&quot;, he said. &quot;The issue is, was that support system within the government and the state of Pakistan, or within the society of Pakistan?&quot;

Others argued that Bin Laden lived in the compound with a local family, and never used the internet or a mobile phone, which would have made him much easier to locate. Pakistan&#x27;s president Asif Ali Zardari denied that his country&#x27;s security forces sheltered Bin Laden, and called any supposed support for Bin Laden by the Pakistani government baseless speculation. Government officials said that the country&#x27;s limited resources had been committed to its war against the Pakistan Taliban, and other insurgents who posed an active threat to it, rather than to finding or sheltering Bin Laden. Coll states that as of 2019 there is no direct evidence showing Pakistani knowledge of Bin Laden&#x27;s presence in Abbottabad. Documents captured from the Abbottabad compound generally show that Bin Laden was wary of contact with Pakistani intelligence and police, especially in light of Pakistan&#x27;s role in the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

== Reception and legacy ==
Bin Laden&#x27;s supporters have referred to him by several nicknames, including the &quot;Emir&quot; (), the &quot;Sheik&quot; (), the &quot;Jihadist Sheik&quot; or &quot;Sheik al-Mujahid&quot; (), &quot;Hajj&quot; (), the &quot;Director&quot;, &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Lion Sheik&quot;. Despite condemnations from U.S-allied governments in the Arab world, anti-American protestors from Pakistan to Palestinian territories used his portraits during their protests, speeches and public campaigns; owing to his widespread popularity that once pervaded the Arab World during the early 2000s. His popularity reached its apex through the course of the Iraq War; during which opinion polls conducted in various Muslim countries gave him 50% – 60% favourable ratings. During a June 2020 Pakistani parliament session, Imran Khan denounced Bin Laden&#x27;s killing, labelling it as &quot;an embarrassing moment&quot; in their country&#x27;s history, and also praised Bin Laden as a &quot;Shaheed&quot; (martyr). He further criticized the co-operation policies of past Pakistani governments with the U.S. during its &quot;War on Terror&quot;, arguing that such policies brought humiliation to Pakistan. Obama concluded the first volume of his presidential memoir with the killing of Bin Laden.

Bin Laden is a reviled figure in the Western world, where he is regarded as a terrorist and mass murderer. Mark Hosenball wrote:
=== &quot;Letter to the American People&quot; ===
In November 2023, amid the Gaza war, Bin Laden&#x27;s &quot;Letter to the American People&quot;, published in 2002, became the subject of public controversy after some TikTok users expressed sympathy with Bin Laden&#x27;s statements in the letter regarding the Israel–Palestine conflict, which later went viral after a compilation of these videos was posted on Twitter. The letter was removed from &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; website after more than 20 years of being present online in the news outlet&#x27;s webpage and TikTok began taking down videos that shared the letter.

<text>Ontogeny (also ontogenesis) is the origination and development of an organism (both physical and psychological, e.g., moral development), usually from the time of fertilization of the egg to adult. The term can also be used to refer to the study of the entirety of an organism&#x27;s lifespan.

Ontogeny is the developmental history of an organism within its own lifetime, as distinct from phylogeny, which refers to the evolutionary history of a species. Another way to think of ontogeny is that it is the process of an organism going through all of the developmental stages over its lifetime. The developmental history includes all the developmental events that occur during the existence of an organism, beginning with the changes in the egg at the time of fertilization and events from the time of birth or hatching and afterward (i.e., growth, remolding of body shape, development of secondary sexual characteristics, etc.). While developmental (i.e., ontogenetic) processes can influence subsequent evolutionary (e.g., phylogenetic) processes (see evolutionary developmental biology and recapitulation theory), individual organisms develop (ontogeny), while species evolve (phylogeny).

Ontogeny, embryology and developmental biology are closely related studies and those terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Aspects of ontogeny are morphogenesis, the development of form and shape of an organism; tissue growth; and cellular differentiation. The term ontogeny has also been used in cell biology to describe the development of various cell types within an organism. Ontogeny is an important field of study in many disciplines, including developmental biology, cell biology, genetics, developmental psychology, developmental cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychobiology. Ontogeny is used in anthropology as &quot;the process through which each of us embodies the history of our own making&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;ontogeny&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;on&quot; meaning a being, individual; and existence, and from the suffix &quot;-geny&quot; from the Greek -&quot;geniea&quot;, meaning genesis, origin, and mode of production.

==History==

The term ontogeny was coined by Ernst Haeckel, a German zoologist and evolutionist in the 1860s. Haeckel, born in Germany on February 16, 1834, was also a strong supporter of Darwinism. Haeckel suggested that ontogeny briefly and sometimes incompletely recapitulated or repeated phylogeny in his 1866 book, &quot;Generelle Morphologie der Organismen&quot; (&quot;General Morphology of Organisms&quot;). Even though his book was widely read, the scientific community was not very convinced or interested in his ideas, so he turned to producing more publications to get more attention. In 1866, Haeckel and others imagined development as producing new structures after earlier additions to the developing organism have been established. He proposed that individual development followed developmental stages of previous generations and that the future generations would add something new to this process, and that there was a causal parallelism between an animal&#x27;s ontogeny and phylogeny. In addition, Haeckel suggested a biogenetic law that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, based on the idea that the successive and progressive origin of new species was based on the same laws as the successive and progressive origin of new embryonic structures. According to Haeckel, development produced novelties, and natural selection would eliminate species that had become outdated or obsolete. Though his view of development and evolution wasn&#x27;t justifiable, future embryologists tweaked and collaborated with Haeckel&#x27;s proposals and showed how new morphological structures can occur by the hereditary modification of embryonic development. Marine biologist Walter Garstang reversed Haeckel&#x27;s relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny, stating that ontogeny creates phylogeny, not recapitulates it.

A seminal 1963 paper by Nikolaas Tinbergen named ontogeny as one of the four primary questions of biology, along with Julian Huxley&#x27;s three others: causation, survival value and evolution. Tinbergen emphasized that the change of behavioral &quot;machinery&quot; during development was distinct from the change in behavior during development. We can conclude that the thrush itself, i.e. its behavioral machinery, has changed only if the behavior change occurred while the environment was held constant...When we turn from description to causal analysis, and ask in what way the observed change in behavior machinery has been brought about, the natural first step is to try and distinguish between environmental influences and those within the animal...In ontogeny the conclusion that a certain change is internally controlled (is &#x27;innate&#x27;) is reached by &quot;elimination&quot;. Tinbergen was concerned that the elimination of environmental factors is difficult to establish, and the use of the word innate is often misleading.

== Developmental stages ==
Development of an organism happens through fertilization, cleavage, blastulation, gastrulation, organogenesis, and metamorphosis into an adult. Each species of animal has a slightly different journey through these stages, since some stages might be shorter or longer when compared to other species, and where the offspring develops is different for each animal type (e.g., in a hard egg shell, uterus, soft egg shell, on a plant leaf, etc.).

=== Fertilization ===
In humans, the process of fetal development starts after sperm fertilizes an egg and they fuse together, kickstarting embryonic development. The fusion of egg and sperm into a zygote changes the surrounding membrane to not allow any more sperm to penetrate the egg, so multiple fertilizations can be prevented. Fusion of a zygote also activates the egg so it can begin undergoing cell division. Each animal species might not have specifically a sperm and an egg, but two gametes that contain half of the species&#x27; typical genetic material and the membranes of these gametes fuse to start creating an offspring.

=== Cleavage ===
Not long after successful fertilization by sperm, the zygote undergoes many mitotic divisions, which are also non-sexual cell divisions. Cleavage is the process of cell division, so the starting zygote becomes a collection of identical cells which is a morula and contains cells called blastomeres. Cleavage prepares the zygote to become an embryo, which is from 2 weeks to 8 weeks after conception (fertilization) in humans.
=== Blastulation ===
After the zygote has become an embryo, it continues dividing into a hollow sphere of cells, which is a blastula. These outer cells form a single epithelial layer, the blastoderm, that essentially encases the fluid-filled inside that is the blastocoel. The figure to the right shows the basic process that is modified in different species. Blastulation differs slightly in different species, but in mammals, the eight-cell stage embryo forms into a slightly different type of blastula, called a blastocyst. Other species such as sea stars, frogs, chicks, and mice have all the same structures in this stage, yet the orientation of these features differs, plus these species have additional types of cells in this stage.
=== Gastrulation ===
After blastulation, the single-layered blastula expands and reorganizes into multiple layers, a gastrula (seen in the figure to the right). Reptiles, birds and mammals are triploblastic organisms, meaning the gastrula comprises three germ layers; the endoderm (inner layer), mesoderm (middle layer), and ectoderm (outer layer). As seen in the figure below, each germ layer will become multi-potent stem cells that can become a specific tissue depending on the germ layer and is what happens in humans. This differentiation of germ layers differs slightly, because not all of the organs and tissues below are in all organisms, but corresponding body systems can be substituted in place of these.

=== Organogenesis ===
In the figure below, human germ cells are able to differentiate into the specific organs and tissues they become later on in life. Germ cells are able to migrate to their final locations to rearrange themselves and some organs are made of two germ layers; one for the outside, the other for the inside. The endoderm cells become the internal linings of organisms, such as the stomach, colon, small intestine, liver, and pancreas of the digestive system and the lungs. The mesoderm gives rise to other tissues not formed by the ectoderm, such as the heart, muscles, bones, blood, dermis of the skin, bone marrow, and the urogenital system. This germ layer is more specific for species, as it is the distinguishing layer of the three that can identify evolutionarily higher life-forms (e.g., bilateral organisms like humans) from lower-life forms (with radial symmetry). Lastly, the ectoderm is the outer layer of cells that become the epidermis and hair while being the precursor to the mammary glands, central nervous system, and the peripheral nervous systems.

The figure above shows how the development of a pig, cow, rabbit, and human offspring are similar when compared to one another. This figure shows how the germ layers can become different organs and tissues in evolutionarily higher life-forms and how these species essentially develop very similarly. Additionally, it shows how multiple species develop in a parallel manner but branch off to develop more specific features for the organism such as hooves, a tail, or ears. 

==== Neurulation ====
In developing vertebrate offspring, a neural tube is formed through either primary or secondary neurulation. Some species develop their spine and nervous system using both primary and secondary neurulation, while others use only primary or secondary neurulation. In human fetal development, primary neurulation occurs during weeks 3 and 4 of gestation to develop the brain and spinal cord. Then during weeks 5 and 6 of gestation, secondary neurulation forms the lower sacral and coccygeal cord.

===== Primary Neurulation =====
The diagram to the right illustrates primary neurulation, which is the process of cells surrounding the neural plate interacting with neural plate cells to proliferate, converge, and pinch off to form a hollow tube above the notochord and mesoderm. This process is discontinuous and can start at different points along the cranial-caudal axis necessary for it to close. After the neural crest closes, the neural crest cells and ectoderm cells separate and the ectoderm becomes the epidermis surrounding this complex. The neural crest cells differentiate to become components of most of the peripheral nervous system in animals. Next, the notochord degenerates to become only the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs and the mesoderm cells differentiate to become the somites and skeletal muscle later on. Also during this stage, the neural crest cells become the spinal ganglions, which function as the brain in organisms like earthworms and arthropods. In more advanced organisms like amphibians, birds and mammals; the spinal ganglions consists of a cluster of nerve bodies positioned along the spinal cord at the dorsal and ventral roots of a spinal nerve, which is a pair of nerves that correspond to a vertebra of the spine.

===== Secondary Neurulation =====
In secondary neurulation, caudal and sacral regions of the spine are formed after primary neurulation is finished. This process initiates once primary neurulation is finished and the posterior neuropore closes, so the tail bud can proliferate and condense, then create a cavity and fuse with the central canal of the neural tube. Secondary neurulation occurs in the small region starting at the spinal tail bud up to the posterior neuropore, which is the open neural folds near the tail region that don&#x27;t close through primary neurulation. As canalization progresses over the next few weeks, neurons and ependymal cells (cells that create cerebral spinal fluid) differentiate to become the tail end of the spinal cord. Next, the closed neural tube contains neuroepithelial cells that immediately divide after closure and a second type of cell forms; the neuroblast. Neuroblast cells form the mantle layer, which later becomes the gray matter, which then gives rise to a marginal layer that becomes the white matter of the spinal cord. Secondary neurulation is seen in the neural tube of the lumbar and tail vertebrae of frogs and chicks and in both instances, this process is like a continuation of gastrulation.
=== Larval and juvenile phases ===
In most species, the young organism that is just born or hatched is not sexually mature yet and in most animals, this young organism looks quite different than the adult form. This young organism is the larva and is the intermediate form before metamorphosing into an adult. A well known example of a larval form of an animal is the caterpillar of butterflies and moths. Caterpillars keep growing and feeding in order for enough energy during the pupal stage, when necessary body parts for metamorphosis are grown. The juvenile phase is different in plants and animals, but in plants juvenility is an early phase of plant growth in which plants can&#x27;t flower. In animals, the juvenile stage is most commonly found in social mammals, such as wild dogs, monkeys, apes, lions, wolves, and more. In humans, puberty marks the end of this stage and adolescence follows. Some species begin puberty and reproduction before the juvenile stage is over, such as in female non-human primates. The larval and pupal stages can be seen in the figure to the right.

=== Metamorphosis ===
The process of an organism&#x27;s body undergoing structural and physical changes after birth or hatching to become suitable for its adult environment is metamorphosis. For example, amphibian tadpoles have a maturation of liver enzymes, hemoglobin, and eye pigments, in addition to their nervous, digestive, and reproductive systems being remodeled. In all species, molting and juvenile hormones appear to regulate these changes. The figure to the right shows the stages of life in butterflies and their metamorphosis transforms the caterpillar into a butterfly.

=== Adulthood ===
Adulthood is the stage of when physical and intellectual maturity have been achieved and this differs between species. In humans, adulthood is thought to be around 20 or 21 years old and is the longest stage of life, but in all species it ends with death. In dogs, small breeds (e.g., Yorkshire Terrier, Chihuahua, Cocker Spaniel, etc.) physically mature faster than large breeds (e.g., Saint Bernard, Great Dane, Golden Retriever, etc.), so adulthood is reached anywhere from 12 to 24 months or 1 to 2 years. In contrast, many insect species have long larval stages and the adult stage is only for reproduction. The silkworm moths don&#x27;t have mouthparts and don&#x27;t feed, so they have to consume enough food during the larval stage for energy to survive and mate.

==== Senescence ====
Senescence is when cells stop dividing but don&#x27;t die, but these cells can build up and cause problems in the body. These cells can release substances that cause inflammation and can damage healthy nearby cells. Senescence can be induced by un-repaired DNA damage (e.g., from radiation, old age, etc.) or other cellular stress and also is the state of being old.

=== Ontogenetic allometry ===
Most organisms undergo allometric changes in shape as they grow and mature, while others engage in metamorphosis. Even reptiles (non-avian sauropsids, e.g., crocodilians, turtles, snakes, and lizards), in which the offspring are often viewed as miniature adults, show a variety of ontogenetic changes in morphology and physiology.

<text>Ophiuchus () is a large constellation straddling the celestial equator. Its name comes from the Ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;serpent-bearer&quot;, and it is commonly represented as a man grasping a snake. The serpent is represented by the constellation Serpens. Ophiuchus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. An old alternative name for the constellation was Serpentarius.

==Location==

Ophiuchus lies between Aquila, Serpens, Scorpius, Sagittarius, and Hercules, northwest of the center of the Milky Way. The southern part lies between Scorpius to the west and Sagittarius to the east. In the northern hemisphere, it is best visible in summer. It is opposite of Orion. Ophiuchus is depicted as a man grasping a serpent; the interposition of his body divides the snake constellation Serpens into two parts, Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda. Ophiuchus straddles the equator with the majority of its area lying in the southern hemisphere. Rasalhague, its brightest star, lies near the northern edge of Ophiuchus at about declination. The constellation extends southward to −30° declination. Segments of the ecliptic within Ophiuchus are south of −20° declination (see chart at right).

In contrast to Orion, from November to January (summer in the Southern Hemisphere, winter in the Northern Hemisphere), Ophiuchus is in the daytime sky and thus not visible at most latitudes. However, for much of the polar region north of the Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s winter months, the Sun is below the horizon even at midday. Stars (and thus parts of Ophiuchus, especially Rasalhague) are then visible at twilight for a few hours around local noon, low in the south. In the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s spring and summer months, when Ophiuchus is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation is actually not visible, because the midnight sun obscures the stars at those times and places in the Arctic. In countries close to the equator, Ophiuchus appears overhead in June around midnight and in the October evening sky.
==Features==

===Stars===
The brightest stars in Ophiuchus include α Ophiuchi, called Rasalhague (&quot;head of the serpent charmer&quot;), at magnitude 2.07, and η Ophiuchi, known as Sabik (&quot;the preceding one&quot;), at magnitude 2.43. Alpha Ophiuchi is composed of an A-type (bluish-white) giant star and a K-type main sequence star. The primary is a rapid rotator with an inclined axis of rotation. Eta Ophiuchi is a binary system. Other bright stars in the constellation include β Ophiuchi, Cebalrai (&quot;dog of the shepherd&quot;) and λ Ophiuchi, or Marfik (&quot;the elbow&quot;). Beta Ophiuchi is an evolved red giant star that is slightly more massive than the Sun. Lambda Ophiuchi is a binary star system with the primary being more massive and luminous than the Sun.

RS Ophiuchi is part of a class called recurrent novae, whose brightness increase at irregular intervals by hundreds of times in a period of just a few days. It is thought to be at the brink of becoming a type-1a supernova. It erupts around every 15 years and usually has a magnitude of around 5.0 during eruptions, most recently in 2021.

Barnard&#x27;s Star, one of the nearest stars to the Solar System (the only stars closer are the Alpha Centauri binary star system and Proxima Centauri), lies in Ophiuchus. It is located to the left of β and just north of the V-shaped group of stars in an area that was once occupied by the now-obsolete constellation of Taurus Poniatovii (Poniatowski&#x27;s Bull). It is thought that an exoplanet orbits around the star,
but later studies have refuted this claim. In 1998, an intense flare was observed. The star has also been a target of plans for interstellar travel such as Project Daedalus. In 2005, astronomers using data from the Green Bank Telescope discovered a superbubble so large that it extends beyond the plane of the galaxy. It is called the Ophiuchus Superbubble.

In April 2007, astronomers announced that the Swedish-built Odin satellite had made the first detection of clouds of molecular oxygen in space, following observations in the constellation Ophiuchus. The supernova of 1604 was first observed on 9 October 1604, near θ Ophiuchi. Johannes Kepler saw it first on 16 October and studied it so extensively that the supernova was subsequently called &quot;Kepler&#x27;s Supernova&quot;. He published his findings in a book titled &quot;De stella nova in pede Serpentarii&quot; (&quot;On the New Star in Ophiuchus&#x27;s Foot&quot;). Galileo used its brief appearance to counter the Aristotelian dogma that the heavens are changeless. It was a Type Ia supernova and the most recent Milky Way supernova visible to the unaided eye. In 2009 it was announced that GJ 1214, a star in Ophiuchus, undergoes repeated, cyclical dimming with a period of about 1.5 days consistent with the transit of a small orbiting planet. The planet&#x27;s low density (about 40% that of Earth) suggests that the planet might have a substantial component of low-density gas—possibly hydrogen or steam. The proximity of this star to Earth (42 light years) makes it a feasible target for further observations. The host star emits X-rays which could have removed mass from the exoplanet. In April 2010, the naked-eye star ζ Ophiuchi was occulted by the asteroid 824 Anastasia.

===Deep-sky objects===

Ophiuchus contains several star clusters, such as IC 4665, NGC 6633, M9, M10, M12, M14, M19, M62, and M107, as well as the nebula IC 4603-4604.

M9 is a globular cluster which may have an extra-galactic origin. M10 is a fairly close globular cluster, only 20,000 light-years from Earth. It has a magnitude of 6.6 and is a Shapley class VII cluster. This means that it has &quot;intermediate&quot; concentration; it is only somewhat concentrated towards its center. M12 is a globular cluster which is around 5 kiloparsecs from the Solar System. M14 is another globular cluster which is somewhat farther away. Globular cluster M19 is oblate-shaped with multiple different types of variable stars. M62 is a globular cluster rich in variable stars such as RR Lyrae variables and has two generations of stars with different element abundances. M107 is also rich in variable stars.

The unusual galaxy merger remnant and starburst galaxy NGC 6240 is also in Ophiuchus. At a distance of 400 million light-years, this &quot;butterfly-shaped&quot; galaxy has two supermassive black holes 3,000 light-years apart. Confirmation of the fact that both nuclei contain black holes was obtained by spectra from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Astronomers estimate that the black holes will merge in another billion years. NGC 6240 also has an unusually high rate of star formation, classifying it as a starburst galaxy. This is likely due to the heat generated by the orbiting black holes and the aftermath of the collision. Both have active galactic nuclei.

In 2006, a new nearby star cluster was discovered associated with the 4th magnitude star Mu Ophiuchi. The Mamajek 2 cluster appears to be a poor cluster remnant analogous to the Ursa Major Moving Group, but 7 times more distant (approximately 170 parsecs away). Mamajek 2 appears to have formed in the same star-forming complex as the NGC 2516 cluster roughly 135 million years ago.

Barnard 68 is a large dark nebula, located 410 light-years from Earth. Despite its diameter of 0.4 light-years, Barnard 68 only has twice the mass of the Sun, making it both very diffuse and very cold, with a temperature of about 16 kelvins. Though it is currently stable, Barnard 68 will eventually collapse, inciting the process of star formation. One unusual feature of Barnard 68 is its vibrations, which have a period of 250,000 years. Astronomers speculate that this phenomenon is caused by the shock wave from a supernova. Barnard 68 has blocked thousands of stars visible at other wavelengths and the distribution of dust in Barnard 68 has been mapped.

The space probe Voyager 1, the furthest man-made object from earth, is traveling in the direction of Ophiuchus. It is located between α Herculis, α Ophiuchi and κ Ophiuchi at right ascension 17h 13m and declination +12° 25’ (July 2020).

In November 2022, the USA&#x27;s NSF NOIRLab (National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory) announced the unambiguous identification of the nearest stellar black hole orbited by a G-type main-sequence star, the system identified as Gaia BH1 at around 1,560 light years from the Sun.

==History and mythology==
There is no evidence of the constellation preceding the classical era, and in Babylonian astronomy, a &quot;Sitting Gods&quot; constellation seems to have been located in the general area of Ophiuchus. However, Gavin White proposes that Ophiuchus may in fact be remotely descended from this Babylonian constellation, representing Nirah, a serpent-god who was sometimes depicted with his upper half human but with serpents for legs.

The earliest mention of the constellation is in Aratus, informed by the lost catalogue of Eudoxus of Cnidus (4th century BC): 

To the ancient Greeks, the constellation represented the god Apollo struggling with a huge snake that guarded the Oracle of Delphi.

Later myths identified Ophiuchus with Laocoön, the Trojan priest of Poseidon, who warned his fellow Trojans about the Trojan Horse and was later slain by a pair of sea serpents sent by the gods to punish him. According to Roman era mythography, the figure represents the healer Asclepius, who learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius&#x27; care, Jupiter killed him with a bolt of lightning, but later placed his image in the heavens to honor his good works. In medieval Islamic astronomy (Azophi&#x27;s &quot;Uranometry&quot;, 10th century), the constellation was known as &quot;Al-Ḥawwa&quot;&#x27;, &quot;the snake-charmer&quot;.

Aratus describes Ophiuchus as trampling on Scorpius with his feet. This is depicted in Renaissance to Early Modern star charts, beginning with Albrecht Dürer in 1515; in some depictions (such as that of Johannes Kepler in &quot;De Stella Nova&quot;, 1606), Scorpius also seems to threaten to sting Serpentarius in the foot. This is consistent with Azophi, who already included ψ Oph and ω Oph as the snake-charmer&#x27;s &quot;left foot&quot;, and θ Oph and ο Oph as his &quot;right foot&quot;, making Ophiuchus a zodiacal constellation at least as regards his feet. This arrangement has been taken as symbolic in later literature and placed in relation to the words spoken by God to the serpent in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:15).

==Zodiac==
Ophiuchus is one of the 13 constellations that cross the ecliptic. It has sometimes been suggested as the &quot;13th sign of the zodiac&quot;. However, this confuses zodiac or astrological signs with constellations. The signs of the zodiac are a 12-fold division of the ecliptic, so that each sign spans 30° of celestial longitude, approximately the distance the Sun travels in a month, and (in the Western tradition) are aligned with the seasons so that the March equinox always falls on the boundary between Pisces and Aries. Constellations, on the other hand, are unequal in size and are based on the positions of the stars. The constellations of the zodiac have only a loose association with the signs of the zodiac, and do not in general coincide with them. In Western astrology the constellation of Aquarius, for example, largely corresponds to the sign of Pisces. Similarly, the constellation of Ophiuchus occupies most (29 November – 18 December) of the sign of Sagittarius (23 November – 21 December). The differences are due to the fact that the time of year that the Sun passes through a particular zodiac constellation&#x27;s position has slowly changed (because of the precession of the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis) over the centuries from when the Babylonians originally developed the zodiac.

<doc id="22473" wikidata="Q317279" url="?curid=22473" title="Owain Glyndŵr">
<text>Owain ap Gruffydd (20 September 1415), commonly known as Owain Glyndŵr (Glyn Dŵr, , anglicised as Owen Glendower) was a Welsh leader, soldier and military commander in the late Middle Ages, who led a 15-year-long Welsh revolt with the aim of ending English rule in Wales. He was an educated lawyer, forming the first Welsh parliament under his rule, and was the last native-born Welshman to claim the title Prince of Wales. 

During the year 1400, Glyndŵr, a Welsh soldier and Lord of Glyndyfrdwy had a dispute with a neighbouring English Lord, the event spiralled into a national revolt which pitted common Welsh countrymen and nobles against the English military. In response to the rebellion, discriminatory penal laws were implemented against the Welsh people; this deepened civil unrest and significantly increased support for Glyndŵr across Wales. Then, in 1404, after a series of successful castle sieges and several battlefield victories for the Welsh, Glyndŵr gained control of most of Wales and was proclaimed by his supporters as the Prince of Wales, in the presence of envoys from several other European kingdoms, and military aid was given from France, Brittany, and Scotland. He proceeded to summon the first Welsh parliament in Machynlleth, where he outlined his plans for Wales which included building two universities, reinstating the medieval Welsh laws of Hywel Dda, and build an independent Welsh church.

The war continued, and over the next several years, the English gradually gained control of large parts of Wales. By 1409 Owain&#x27;s last remaining castles of Harlech and Aberystwyth had been captured by English forces. Glyndŵr refused two royal pardons and retreated to the Welsh hills and mountains with his remaining forces, where he continued to resist English rule by using guerrilla warfare tactics, until his disappearance in 1415, when he was recorded to have died by one of his followers, Adam of Usk.

Glyndŵr was never captured or killed, and he was also never betrayed despite being a fugitive of the law with a large bounty. In Welsh culture he acquired a mythical status alongside Cadwaladr, Cynon ap Clydno and King Arthur as a folk hero – &#x27;The Foretold Son&#x27; (). In William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; he appears as the character &quot;Owen Glendower&quot; as a king rather than a prince.

== Early life and marriage==
Owain ap Gruffydd () was born during 1354 (1359?) in Sycharth, North East Wales, into a powerful Anglo-Welsh gentry family. His father, Gruffydd Fychan II had a claim to be hereditary Prince of Powys Fadog and was the Baron of Glyndyfrdwy and Lord of Cynllaith Owain, who died around 1370, leaving Glyndŵr&#x27;s mother Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywelyn, a woman with an accent from Ceredigion (Deheubarth), a widow when he was still a boy. Owain Glyndŵr was a descendant of all three Welsh Royal Principalities (royal houses). Through his father, he was the heir of the former Kingdom of Powys (House of Mathrafal). And through his mother, he was the direct descendant and heir of both Deheubarth (House of Dinefwr) and Gwynedd (House of Aberffraw). He may also have been a descendant of the English King Edward I, through his granddaughter Eleanor. However the existence of Eleanor is disputed.

The young Owain ap Gruffydd was possibly fostered at the home of David Hanmer, a rising lawyer shortly to be a justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, or at the home of Richard FitzAlan, 3rd Earl of Arundel. Owain is then thought to have been sent to London to study law at the Inns of Court, as a student in Westminster, London, for over a period of seven years. He was possibly in London during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381. By 1384, he was living in Wales and married to David&#x27;s daughter, Margaret Hanmer; their marriage took place, perhaps in 1383, in St Chad&#x27;s Church, Hanmer in north-east Wales. Although other sources state that they were married in the 1370s. They started a large family and Owain established himself as the squire of his ancestral lands at Sycharth and Glyndyfrdwy.

===Military service===
Glyndŵr joined the king&#x27;s military service in 1384 when he undertook garrison duty under the Welshman Sir Gregory Sais on the English–Scottish border at Berwick-upon-Tweed. His surname Sais, meaning &#x27;Englishman&#x27; in Welsh, refers to his ability to speak English, not common in Wales at the time. In August 1385, he served King Richard II under the command of John of Gaunt, again in Scotland. Then, in 1386, he was called to give evidence at the High Court of Chivalry, in the &quot;Scrope v Grosvenor&quot; trial at Chester on 3 September that year. In March 1387, Owain fought as a squire to Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel, where he saw action in the English Channel at the defeat of a Franco-Spanish-Flemish fleet off the coast of Kent during the Battle of Margate. Upon the death in late 1387 of his father-in-law, Sir David Hanmer, knighted earlier that same year by the then King of England, Richard II, Glyndŵr returned to Wales as executor of his estate. Glyndŵr next served as a squire to Henry Bolingbroke (later King Henry IV), son of John of Gaunt, at the short Battle of Radcot Bridge in December 1387. From 1384 until 1388 he had been active in military service and had gained three full years of military experience in different theatres, and had witnessed some key events and noteworthy people at first hand.

King Richard was distracted by a growing conflict with the Lords Appellant from this time on. Glyndŵr&#x27;s opportunities were further limited by the death of Sir Gregory Sais in 1390 and the sidelining of FitzAlan, and he probably returned to his stable Welsh estates, living there quietly for ten years during his forties. The bard Iolo Goch, himself a Welsh Lord, visited Glyndŵr in Sycharth in the 1390s and wrote a number of odes to Owain, praising his host&#x27;s liberality and writing of Sycharth, &quot;Very rarely was a bolt or lock to be seen there.&quot;

==Glyndŵr&#x27;s Welsh rebellion==

===Prequel to rebellion===
In the late 1390s, a series of events occurred which cornered Owain, and forced his ambitions towards a rebellion. The events would later be called the Welsh Revolt, the Glyndŵr Rising (within Wales), or the Last War of Independence. His neighbour, Baron Grey of Ruthin, had seized control of some land, for which Glyndŵr appealed to the English Parliament, however, Owain&#x27;s petition for redress was ignored. Later, in 1400, Lord Grey did not inform Glyndŵr in time about a royal command to levy feudal troops for Scottish border service, thus enabling him to call Glyndŵr a traitor in London court circles. Lord Grey had stature in the royal court of Henry IV. The law courts refused to hear the case, or it was delayed because Lord Grey prevented Owain&#x27;s letter from reaching the King, which would have repercussions. Sources state that Glyndŵr was under threat because he had written an angry letter to Lord Grey, boasting that lands had come into his possession, and he had stolen some of Lord Grey&#x27;s horses; and believing Lord Grey had threatened to &quot;burn and slay&quot; within his lands, he threatened retaliation in the same manner. Lord Grey then denied making the initial threat to burn and slay, and replied that he would take the incriminating letter to Henry IV&#x27;s council and that Glyndŵr would hang for the admission of theft and treason contained within the letter. The deposed king, Richard II, had support in Wales, and in January 1400 serious civil disorder broke out in the English border city of Chester after the public execution of an officer of Richard II.

===Initial revolts===
At Sycharth, in Glyndyfrdwy on 16 September 1400, in front of his immediate family, his in-laws, Welsh people from Berwyn, friends from North-East Wales, the Dean of St Asaph totalling 300 men, Owain Glyndŵr prophecised that he was the person to save his people from the English invasions, and proclaimed himself the Prince of Wales. And, after that day, he instigated a 15-year rebellion against the rule of Henry IV. Then came a number of initial confrontations between Henry IV and Owain&#x27;s followers in September and October 1400, as the revolt began to spread around North Wales. Glyndŵr, the self appointed Prince of Wales and his hundreds of followers launched an assault on Lord Grey&#x27;s territories burning Ruthin, they continued to Denbigh, Rhuddlan, Flint, Holt, Oswestry and Welshpool, all of which were seen as English towns in Wales. The initial revolt got the attention of the King of England after letters were sent asking for military assistance to combat the Welsh rebels. Much of northern and central Wales went over to Glyndŵr, and from then on, Glyndŵr would stay and hiding and only appear to attack his enemy, his army used effective guerrilla warfare tactics against the English occupying territories in Wales.

===Welsh rebellion===

On Good Friday (1 April) 1401, 40 of Glyndwr&#x27;s men who were led by his cousins, Rhys ap Tudur and Gwilym ap Tudur took Conwy Castle in North Wales. In response, King Henry IV appointed Henry Percy (Hotspur) to bring the country to order. A month later, the King and the English parliament issued an amnesty on 10 March which applied to all rebels with the exception of Owain and his cousins, the Tudurs, however, both the Tudurs were eventually pardoned after they gave up Conwy Castle on 28 May that same year. Hotspur won a battle at Cadair Idris two days later, but that was to be his final service for the King of England, as he retired his command as leader of the English troops after dealing with Glyndŵr. During that time in the spring of 1401, Glyndŵr appears in South Wales. 

In June, Glyndŵr scored his first major victory in the field at Mynydd Hyddgen on Pumlumon, however, retaliation by Henry IV on Strata Florida Abbey was to follow in October that same year. The rebel uprising had occupied all of North Wales; labourers seized whatever weapons they could, and farmers sold their cattle to buy arms. Secret meetings were held everywhere, and bards &quot;wandered about as messengers of sedition&quot;. Henry IV heard of a Welsh uprising at Leicester; Henry&#x27;s army wandered North Wales to Anglesey and drove out Franciscan friars who favoured Richard II. All the while Glyndŵr, who was in hiding, had his estate at Sycarth forfeited by the King to John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset on 9 November 1400. Then, by autumn, Gwynedd and Ceredigion (which temporarily submitted to England for a pardon) and Powys adhered to the rising against the English rule by supporting the rebellion. Glyndŵr&#x27;s attempts at stoking rebellion with help from the Scottish and Irish were quashed, with the English showing no mercy and hanging some messengers.

As a response to the situation of warfare in Wales, the English Parliament between 1401 and 1402 enacted penal laws against the Welsh, designed to coerce submission in Wales, but the result was to create resentment that pushed many Welshmen into the rebellion. In the same year, Glyndŵr captured his archenemy Baron Grey de Ruthyn. He held him for almost a year until he received a substantial ransom from Henry. In June 1402, Glyndŵr defeated an English force led by Sir Edmund Mortimer near Pilleth (the Battle of Bryn Glas), where Mortimer was captured. Glyndŵr offered to release Mortimer for a large ransom but, in sharp contrast to his attitude to de Grey, Henry IV refused to pay. Mortimer&#x27;s nephew could be said to have had a greater claim to the English throne than Henry himself, so his speedy release was not an option. In response, Mortimer negotiated an alliance with Glyndŵr and married one of Glyndŵr&#x27;s daughters. It is also in 1402 that mention of the French and the people of Flanders helping Owain&#x27;s daughter Janet, who was negotiating on the continent for her father for two years until 1404.

News of the rebellion&#x27;s success spread across Europe, and Glyndŵr began to receive naval support from Scotland and Brittany. He also received the support of King Charles VI of France, who agreed to send French troops and supplies to aid the rebellion. In 1403 Glyndwr had amassed an army of 4,000 in his first division, and 12,000 soldiers in total. A Welsh army including a French contingent assimilated into forces mainly from Glamorgan and the Rhondda Valleys region commanded by Owain Glyndŵr, his senior general Rhys Gethin and Cadwgan, Lord of Glyn Rhondda, defeated a large English invasion force reputedly led by King Henry IV himself at the Battle of Stalling Down in Glamorgan.

Glyndŵr, facing years on the run, finally lost his estate in the spring of 1403, when Prince Henry as usual marched into Wales unopposed and burnt down Glyndŵr&#x27;s houses at Sycharth and Glyndyfrdwy, as well as the commote of Edeirnion and parts of Powys. Glyndŵr continued to besiege towns and burn down castles; for 10 days in July that year, he toured the south and southwest of Wales until all of the south joined arms in rebelling against English rule. These actions induced an internal rebellion against the King of England, with the Percys joining the rising. It is around this stage of Glyndŵr&#x27;s life that Hywel Sele, a cousin of the Welsh prince, attempted to assassinate Glyndŵr at the Nannau estate.

In 1403, the revolt became truly national in Wales. Royal officials reported that Welsh students at Oxford and Cambridge Universities were leaving their studies to join Glyndŵr, and also that Welsh labourers and craftsmen were abandoning their employers in England and returning to Wales. Owain could also draw on Welsh troops seasoned by the English campaigns in France and Scotland. Hundreds of Welsh archers and experienced men-at-arms left the English service to join the rebellion.

In 1404, Glyndŵr&#x27;s forces took Aberystwyth Castle and Harlech Castle, then continued to ravage the south by burning Cardiff Castle. Then, a court was held at Harlech and Gruffydd Young was appointed as the Welsh Chancellor. There had been communication to Louis I, Duke of Orléans in Paris to try (unsuccessfully) to open the Welsh ports to French trade.

=== Crowning as Prince of Wales ===

By 1404, no less than four royal military expeditions into Wales had been repelled, and Owain had solidified his control of the nation. In 1404, he was proclaimed by his supporters Prince of Wales () and held parliaments at Machynlleth and Harlech. He also planned to build two national universities (one in the south and one in the north), to re-introduce the traditional Welsh laws of Hywel Dda, and to establish an independent Welsh church. There were envoys from other countries including France, Scotland, and the Kingdom of León (in Spain). In the summer of 1405, four representatives from every commote in Wales were sent to Harlech.

===Tripartite indenture===

In February 1405, Glyndŵr negotiated the with Edmund Mortimer and Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland. The Indenture agreed to divide England and Wales among the three of them. Wales would extend as far as the rivers Severn and Mersey, including most of Cheshire, Shropshire and Herefordshire. The Mortimer Lords of March would take all of southern and western England and the Percys would take the north of England.
Although negotiations with the lords of Ireland were unsuccessful, Glyndŵr had reason to hope that the French and Bretons might be more welcoming. He dispatched Gruffydd Yonge and his brother-in-law (Margaret&#x27;s brother), John Hanmer, to negotiate with the French. The result was a formal treaty that promised French aid to Glyndŵr and the Welsh. The immediate effect seems to have been that joint Welsh and Franco-Breton forces attacked and laid siege to Kidwelly Castle. The Welsh could also count on semi-official fraternal aid from the Duchy of Brittany and from Scotland. Scots and French privateers were operating around Wales throughout Owain&#x27;s war. Scottish ships had raided English settlements on the Llŷn Peninsula in 1400 and 1401. In 1403, a Breton squadron defeated the English in the Channel and devastated Jersey, Guernsey and Plymouth, while the French made a landing on the Isle of Wight. By 1404, they were raiding the coast of England, with Welsh troops on board, setting fire to Dartmouth and devastating the coast of Devon.

1405 was the &quot;Year of the French&quot; in Wales. A formal treaty between Wales and France was negotiated. On the continent, the French pressed the English as the French army invaded the English Plantagenet Aquitaine. Simultaneously, the French landed in force at Milford Haven in west Wales, burned Haverford West, and attempted to capture Pembroke Castle before they were bought off. The combined forces of French and Welsh took Carmarthen, which Owain had captured in 1403 but lost again. The occupants were given safe passage out, and they burned the town walls. Enguerrand de Monstrelet, a later chronicler gives an uncorroborated account of a march through Herefordshire and on into Worcestershire to Woodbury Hill, ten miles from Worcester. They met the English army and took positions from which they daily and viewed each other from a mile without any major action for eight days. Then, both sides seeming to find engagement too risky, and departed.

=== Letter to Charles VI of France ===

By 1405, most French forces had withdrawn after politics in Paris shifted towards peace, with the Hundred Years&#x27; War continuing between England and France. On 31 March 1406 Glyndŵr wrote a letter to be sent to Charles VI of France in St Peter ad Vincula church at Pennal, hence its naming after the location it was written at. Glyndŵr&#x27;s letter requested to maintain military support from the French to fend off the English in Wales. Glyndŵr suggested that in return, he would recognise Benedict XIII of Avignon as the Pope. The letter sets out the ambitions of Glyndŵr for an independent Wales with its own parliament, led by himself as Prince of Wales. These ambitions also included the return of the traditional law of Hywel Dda, rather than the enforced English law, establishment of an independent Welsh church as well as two universities, one in south Wales, and one in north Wales. Following this letter, senior churchmen and important members of society flocked to Glyndŵr&#x27;s banner and English resistance was reduced to a few isolated castles, walled towns, and fortified manor houses.

Glyndŵr&#x27;s Great Seal and a letter handwritten by him to the French in 1406 are in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. This letter is currently held in the Archives Nationales in Paris. Facsimile copies involving specialist ageing techniques and moulds of Glyndŵr&#x27;s seal were created by the National Library of Wales and presented by the heritage minister Alun Ffred Jones to six Welsh institutions in 2009. The royal great seal from 1404 was given to Charles IV of France and contains images and Glyndŵr&#x27;s title – Glyndwr referred to himself as the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and claimed his &quot;right of inheritance&quot; in these letters

===The faltering rebellion===
In early 1405, the Welsh forces, who had until then won several easy victories, suffered a series of defeats. Glyndŵr&#x27;s brother, Lord Tudur ap Gruffudd, a commander during the war, died at the Battle of Pwll Melyn in May 1405. English forces landed in Anglesey from Ireland and would over time push the Welsh back until the resistance in Anglesey formally ended toward the end of 1406.

Following the intervention of French forces, battling ensued for years, and in 1406 Prince Henry restored fines and redemption for Welsh soldiers to choose their own fate, prisoners were taken after the battle, and castles were restored to their original owners, this same year a son of Glyndŵr died in battle. By 1408 Glyndŵr had taken refuge in the North of Wales, having lost his ally from Northumberland.

Despite the initial success of the revolution, in 1407 the superior numbers, resources, and wealth that England had at its disposal eventually began to turn the tide of the war, and the much larger and better-equipped English forces gradually began to overwhelm the Welsh. In times of war, the English changed their strategy. Rather than focusing on punitive expeditions as favoured by his father, the young Prince Henry adopted a strategy of economic blockade. Using the castles that remained in English control, he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407, this strategy was beginning to bear fruit, and by 1408, the English regained Aberystwyth and then marched north Harlech Castle, which also surrendered during the cold winter into 1409. Edmund Mortimer died during the siege, and Owain&#x27;s wife Margaret along with two of his daughters (including Catrin) and three of Mortimer&#x27;s granddaughters were captured on the fall of the castle and imprisoned in the Tower of London. They were all to die in the Tower in 1413 and were buried at St Swithin, London Stone. Before his downfall, Glyndŵr was considered the wealthiest of all Welshmen.

Glyndŵr managed to escape capture by disguising himself as an elderly man, sneaking out of the castle and slipping past the English military blockade in the darkness of the night. Glyndŵr retreated to the Welsh wilderness with a band of loyal supporters; he refused to surrender and continued the war with guerrilla tactics such as launching sporadic raids and ambushes throughout Wales and the English borderlands.

Glyndŵr remained free, but he had lost his ancestral home and was a hunted prince. He continued the rebellion, particularly wanting to avenge his wife. In 1410, Owain led a raid into rebel-controlled Shropshire, and in 1412, he carried out one of the final successful raids. With his most faithful soldiers, he cut through the King&#x27;s men in an ambush in Brecon, where he captured, and later ransomed, a leading Welsh supporter of King Henry, Dafydd Gam (&#x27;Crooked David&#x27;). This was the last time that Owain was seen alive by his enemies, although it was claimed he took refuge with the Scudamore family. In the autumn, Glyndŵr&#x27;s Aberystwyth Castle surrendered while he was away fighting. But by then things were changing. Henry IV died in 1413, and his son Henry V began to adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the Welsh. Royal pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and other opponents of his father&#x27;s regime. As late as 1414, there were rumours that the Herefordshire-based Lollard leader Sir John Oldcastle was communicating with Owain, and reinforcements were sent to the major castles in the north and south.

On 21 December 1411, the King of England issued pardons to all Welsh except their leader and Thomas of Trumpington (until 9 April 1413, from which Glyndŵr was no longer excepted). Glyndŵr ignored offers of a pardon on many different occasions, his followers continued to be punished for crimes of war until the 1410s. His death was recorded by a former follower in the year 1415.

====Disappearance====
Nothing certain is known of Glyndŵr after 1412. Despite enormous rewards being offered, he was neither captured nor betrayed. He ignored royal pardons, and it is thought he died in 1415, and certainly by 1417. Adam of Usk, a one-time supporter of Glyndŵr, and writing after the fact, made the following entry in his Chronicle for the year 1415: Thomas Pennant writes that Glyndŵr died on 20 September 1415 at the age of 61 (which would place his birth at approximately 1354). 

Glyndŵr may have lived his last days at Kentchurch in south Herefordshire, the home of the Scudamore family. The poet Lewys Glyn Cothi wrote an elegy for Gwenllian, an illegitimate daughter of Glyndŵr, where it was mentioned that at the time of the Welsh War of independence, the whole of Wales was under Glyndŵr&#x27;s command, with forty dukes as the prince&#x27;s allies, and that later in life he supported 62 female pensioners.

There are many folk tales of Glyndŵr donning disguises to gain an advantage over opponents during the rebellion, and after his disappearance, there has been persistent speculation that the Welsh religious poet, Siôn Cent, the family chaplain of the Scudamore family, was Owain Glyndŵr in disguise.

=== Burial===

Although the location of his burial is unknown, there has long been speculation where Glyndŵr&#x27;s final resting place may be. In 1875, the Rev. Francis Kilvert wrote in his diary that he saw the grave of &quot;Owen Glendower&quot; in the churchyard at Monnington on Wye &quot;[h]ard by the church porch and on the western side of it ... It is a flat stone of whitish-grey shaped like a rude obelisk figure, sunk deep into the ground in the middle of an oblong patch of earth from which the turf has been pared away, and, alas, smashed into several fragments.&quot; Another nearby location is suggested by Adrien Jones, the president of the Owain Glyndŵr Society, who stated, &quot;Four years ago we visited a direct descendant of Glyndŵr, a John Skidmore, at Kentchurch Court, near Abergavenny. He took us to Mornington Straddle in Herefordshire, where one of Glyndŵr&#x27;s daughters, Alice, lived. Mr. Skidmore told us that he (Glyndŵr) spent his last days there and eventually died there... It was a family secret for 600 years, and even Mr Skidmore&#x27;s mother, who died shortly before we visited, refused to reveal the secret. There&#x27;s even a mound where he is believed to be buried at Mornington Straddle.&quot;

The historian Gruffydd Aled Williams suggests in a 2017 monograph that the burial site is in the Kimbolton Chapel near Leominster, the present parish church of St James the Great which used to be the chapelry of Leominster Priory, based upon a number of manuscripts held in the National Archives. Although Kimbolton is an unexceptional and relatively unknown place outside of Herefordshire, it is closely connected to the Scudamore family.

==Issue and descendants==

Owain married Margaret Hanmer, also known by her Welsh name Marred ferch Dafydd, and together they had five or six sons and four or five daughters. Also, Owain had some illegitimate children out of wedlock.

=== Sons ===
*Gruffudd d. 1411.
*Madog.
*Maredudd alive in 1421.
*Thomas.
*John.

All of Owain and Margaret&#x27;s sons from their marriage were either taken prisoner and died in confinement, or died in battle and had no issue. Gruffudd was captured in Gwent by Prince Henry, imprisoned in Nottingham Castle, and later taken to the Tower of London in 1410. Maredudd was recorded as communicating with John Talbot and the English Crown on 24 February 1416, and receiving a royal pardon in 1421, but dying a few years later.

=== Daughters ===
*Alice (Alys), m. John Scudamore of Ewyas.
*Jane.
*Janet, m. Sir John De Croft.
*Margaret, m. Sir Richard Monnington.
*Catherine (Catrin) (d. 1413), m. (1) Edmund Mortimer (d. 1409), (2) Roger Mortimer.

Upon Owain&#x27;s disappearance and death, his eldest (oldest child with descendants) daughter Alice came to be known as the Lady of Glyndyfrdwy and Cynllaith, and heiress de jure of the Principalities of Powys, South Wales and Gwynedd. During 1431, she successfully went to court in Meirionydd to regain her inheritance as the heiress of Sycarth in Glyndyfrdwy against John, Earl of Somerset, who had been granted Owain&#x27;s forfeited lands by the King of England in 1400. Alice&#x27;s descendant&#x27;s married into the Scudamore family and her direct descendant John Lucy Scudamore married the daughter of Harford Jones-Brydges in the early 19th century, and whose daughter in 1852 married the son of Edward Lucas from the Castleshane estate in Ireland. Another daughter, Jane, married Henry, Lord Grey de Ruthin without issue. Then, Janet married into the noble family of Croft Castle in Herefordshire, whose descendants today are titled the Croft Baronets. Whilst Margaret married a knight from Monnington, also in Herefordshire.

=== Illegitimate ===
Glyndŵr&#x27;s illegitimate children with other women included Ieuan, Myfanwy and Gwenllian, whilst it is debated whether his son David was born out of wedlock. Ieuan became Glyndŵr&#x27;s only male descendant to have children. Like his other illegitimate kin, they remained in Wales and married locally into Welsh families. Gwenllian became the wife of Philip ab Rhys ab Cenarth, and was died near St Harmon in Powys (Radnorshire).

===Family poem===
Iolo Goch wrote of Glyndŵr&#x27;s wife, Margaret:
== Welsh kingdoms lineage ==
Owain Glyndŵr had claims to royal ancestry from all three of the final ruling royal houses of Wales; Powys (Mathrafal) and Deheubarth (Dinefwr), and Gwynedd (Aberffraw). His claims were clearest for the first two of these:

=== Gwynedd ancestry ===
As well as being a direct genealogical descendant of the final ruling monarchs of Powys and Deheubarth, Owain Glyndwr&#x27;s ancestors were also descended from the Welsh medieval Kingdom of Gwynedd, descended from the Gwynedd King Gruffudd ap Cynan (d. 1137), via his great-grandmother Gwenllian. However, some sources claim that another ruler of Gwynedd, Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (Llywelyn I, The Great d. 1240), Gruffudd ap Cynan&#x27;s great-grandson, was Glyndwr&#x27;s nearest Gwynedd royal ancestor. Elsewhere, a third suggestion is that he was descended from Llywelyn II, Prince of Wales (Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, d. 1282), and his daughter Catherine. Llywelyn II was Llywelyn I&#x27;s grandson, and also the penultimate Prince of Gwynedd from the final generation of the Aberffraw rulers in Wales before his brother, Dafydd III. Yet some historians note that Llywelyn II&#x27;s only recorded child was a daughter, Gwenllian, who died in 1337 without issue. Professor John Edward Lloyd said: &quot;There is no evidence that Llywelyn had any daughter but Gwenllian, born in the last year of his life and after his death confined for the rest of her days as a nun of the order of Sempringham&quot;. Lloyd&#x27;s assessment has been repeated by those scholars. The claim to Gwynedd heritage through female lines however was subject to Welsh law and was legitimate, albeit with the recognition that &quot;the direct male line of Gwynedd had undeniably become extinct in 1378. Its last representative was Owain Lawgoch.&quot;

==Banners and coat of arms==
== Legacy ==
In Welsh culture Glyndŵr acquired a mythical status alongside other medieval kings such as Cadwaladr, Cynon ap Clydno and King Arthur. He was perceived as a folk hero awaiting a call to return and liberate his people in the classic Welsh mythical role – (&quot;The Foretold Son&quot;). The myth was that one day after a thousand years of servitude under English rule, a &#x27;Son of Prophecy&#x27; would return the Welsh people as rulers of the island of Great Britain. Also, in Welsh folklore, the name Owain has been connected to a legend of the &#x27;son of destiny&#x27;. His claim as the Prince of Wales was similar to that of another distant relative from the Gwynedd dynasty. It was another Owain, Lawgoch (Owain ap Thomas ap Rhodri) who proclaimed his patrimony a few decades earlier, when he attempted to regain his family stature with aid from the King of France in a Franco-Welsh alliance from the late 1360s, until his assassination. 

===Modern legacy===
*Glyndŵr was described by Fidel Castro as the first effective guerrilla leader. It has been suggested that Castro, who may have kept books about the Welshman, and Che Guevara copied some of Glyndŵr&#x27;s methods in the Cuban Revolution.

*During the First World War, the prime minister David Lloyd George unveiled a statue to Glyndŵr in Cardiff City Hall. A statue of Glyndŵr by the sculptor Simon van de Put was installed in The Square in Corwen in 1995, and in 2007 it was replaced with a larger equestrian statue by Colin Spofforth. 

*Glyndŵr came second to Aneurin Bevan in the 100 Welsh Heroes poll of 2003/2004. Stamps were issued with his likeness in 1974 and 2008, and streets, parks, and public squares were named after him throughout Wales. There is a campaign to make 16 September (Owain Glyndŵr Day), the date Glyndŵr raised his standard, a public holiday in Wales, including by Dafydd Wigley in 2021. 

*RGC 1404 (Rygbi Gogledd Cymru/North Wales Rugby) rugby union team is named in honour of the year Owain Glyndŵr was crowned Prince of Wales.

*A road in Aberystwyth was renamed as &quot;Owain Glyndwr Square&quot;.

*To celebrate the 600th year anniversary of Glyndŵr&#x27;s life, a monument was erected in Machynlleth in the grounds of Plas Machynlleth.

====Meibion Glyndŵr====
Glyndŵr is now remembered as a national hero and numerous small groups have adopted his symbolism to advocate independence for Wales or Welsh nationalism. For example, during the 1980s, a group calling itself Meibion Glyndŵr (&quot;the Sons of Glyndŵr&quot;) claimed responsibility for the burning of English holiday homes in Wales.

=== Literature ===
*After Glyndŵr&#x27;s death, there was little resistance to English rule. The Tudor dynasty saw Welshmen become more prominent in English society. In &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, Shakespeare portrays him as Owen Glendower (the name has since been adopted as the anglicised version of Owain Glyndŵr), wild and exotic; a man who claims to be able to &quot;call spirits from the vasty deep&quot;, ruled by magic and tradition in sharp contrast to the more logical but highly emotional Hotspur. Glendower is further noted as being &quot;not in the roll of common men&quot; and &quot;a worthy gentleman,/Exceedingly well read, and profited/ In strange concealments, valiant as a lion/And as wondrous affable and as bountiful/As mines of India.&quot; His enemies describe him &quot;that damn&#x27;d magician&quot;, which was in reference to having the weather on his side in battle.

*It was not until the late 19th century that Glyndŵr&#x27;s reputation was revived, when the Cymru Fydd (&quot;Young Wales&quot;) movement recreated Glyndŵr as the father of Welsh nationalism.

*Glyndŵr later acquired mythical status as the hero awaiting a call to return and liberate his people. Thomas Pennant, in his &quot;Tours in Wales&quot; (1778, 1781 and 1783), searched out and published many of the legends and places associated with the memory of Glyndŵr. Glyndŵr has been featured in a number of works of modern fiction, including most notably John Cowper Powys&#x27;s novel &quot;Owen Glendower&quot; (1941), and Edith Pargeter&#x27;s 1972 publication &quot;A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury&quot;.

*A highly fictionalized Glyndŵr is featured in the popular YA book series The Raven Cycle by Maggie Stiefvater as Owen Glendower. In the series, which takes place in the Shenandoah Valley, characters believe that Glyndŵr&#x27;s body was brought from Wales to Virginia after his death, and that whoever can &quot;wake&quot; him will be granted a wish.

=== Namesakes ===
*The Owain Glyndwr Hotel in Corwen is a historic 18th century coaching inn. 
*The Owain Glyndŵr pub in Cardiff, briefly named Owen Glendower was named in his honour.
*The waymarked, 132-mile long-distance footpath Glyndŵr&#x27;s Way runs through Mid Wales near to his homelands.
*At least two ships and two locomotives have been named after Glyndŵr:
** In 1808, the Royal Navy launched a 36-gun fifth-rate frigate. She served in the Baltic Sea during the Gunboat War where she participated in the seizure of Anholt Island, and then in the Channel. Between 1822 and 1824, she served in the West Africa Squadron (or &quot;Preventative Squadron&quot;) chasing down slave ships, capturing at least two;
** Owen Glendower, an East Indiaman, a Blackwall frigate built in 1839;
** In 1923, a 2-6-2T Vale of Rheidol locomotive was named after Glyndŵr. The locomotive is still operational and was one of a few used by British Rail until it was privatised;
** 70010 &quot;Owen Glendower&quot;, renamed &quot;Owain Glyndŵr&quot;, built in 1951 at the Crewe Works, it was withdrawn in June 1965. It was a British Railways Standard Class 7 mixed-traffic steam locomotive.
*In 2002, a plaque was unveiled near the Tower of London to commemorate Glyndwr&#x27;s Glyndŵr Catrin who died there with her children.
* From 2008 to 2023, Wrexham University was known as (Wrexham) Glyndŵr University in his honour. Despite dropping the name in 2023, the university maintains links with the Owain Glyndŵr Society for one of its annual graduate awards.

<doc id="22475" wikidata="Q10503" url="?curid=22475" title="Octans">
<text>Octans is a faint constellation located in the deep Southern Sky. Its name is Latin for the eighth part of a circle, but it is named after the octant, a navigational instrument. Devised by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1752, Octans remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The southern celestial pole is located within the boundaries of Octans.

==History and mythology==
Octans was one of 14 constellations created by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope, and was originally named &quot;l’Octans de Reflexion&quot; (“the reflecting octant”) in 1752, after he had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment.

It was part of his catalogue of the southern sky, the &quot;Coelum Australe Stelliferum&quot;, which was published posthumously in 1763. In Europe, it became more widely known as &quot;Octans Hadleianus&quot;, in honor of English mathematician John Hadley, who invented the octant in 1730. There is no real mythology related to Octans, partially due to its faintness and relative recentness, but mostly because of its extreme southerly latitude.

==Notable features==

=== Stars ===


Octans is a generally inconspicuous constellation with only one star brighter than magnitude 4; its brightest member is Nu Octantis, a spectral class K1 III giant star with an apparent magnitude 3.73. It is 63.3 ± 0.8 light-years distant from Earth.

Beta Octantis is the second brightest star in the constellation.

Polaris Australis (Sigma Octantis), the southern pole star, is a magnitude 5.4 star just over 1 degree away from the true south celestial pole. Its relative faintness means that it is not practical for navigation.

BQ Octantis is a fainter, magnitude 6.82 star located much closer to the South Pole (at less than a degree) than Sigma.

In addition to having the current southern pole star of Earth, Octans also contains the southern pole star of the planet Saturn, which is the magnitude 4.3 Delta Octantis.

The Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 2003 reported that observations of the Mira variable stars R and T Octantis were urgently needed.

Four star systems are known to have planets. Mu2 Octantis is a binary star system, the brighter component of which has a planet. Nu Octantis A also has a planet orbiting. HD 142022 is a binary system, a component of which is a sunlike star with a massive planet with an orbital period of 1928 ± 46 days. HD 212301 is a yellow-white main sequence star with a hot jupiter that completes an orbit every 2.2 days.

===Deep sky objects===

NGC 2573 (also known as Polarissima Australis) is a faint barred spiral galaxy that happens to be the closest NGC object to the south celestial pole. NGC 7095 and NGC 7098 are two barred spiral galaxies that are 115 million and 95 million light-years distant from Earth respectively. The sparse open cluster Collinder 411 is also located in the constellation.

==Namesakes==
 was a stores ship used by the United States Navy during World War II.

<doc id="22477" wikidata="Q766445" url="?curid=22477" title="Okinawa Prefecture">
<text>is the southernmost and westernmost prefecture of Japan. It has a population of 1,457,162 () and a geographic area of 2,281 km2 (880 sq mi).

Naha is the capital and largest city, with other major cities including Okinawa, Uruma, and Urasoe. Okinawa Prefecture encompasses two thirds of the Ryukyu Islands, including the Okinawa, Daitō and Sakishima groups, extending southwest from the Satsunan Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture to Taiwan (Hualien and Yilan Counties). Okinawa Prefecture&#x27;s largest island, Okinawa Island, is the home to a majority of Okinawa&#x27;s population. The Ryukyuans are the indigenous ethnic group of the Ryukyu Islands, which include all of Okinawa Prefecture and the Amami Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture.

Okinawa was ruled by the Ryukyu Kingdom from 1429 and unofficially annexed by Japan after the invasion of Ryukyu in 1609. Okinawa was officially founded in 1879 by the Empire of Japan after seven years as the Ryukyu Domain, the last domain of the Han system. Okinawa was occupied by the United States during the Allied occupation of Japan after World War II and was governed by the Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands from 1945 to 1950 and Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands from 1950 until the prefecture was returned to Japan in 1972. Okinawa comprises just 0.6 percent of Japan&#x27;s total land mass, but about 26,000 (75%) of United States Forces Japan personnel are assigned to the prefecture; the continued U.S. military presence in Okinawa is controversial.

==History==

The oldest evidence of human existence on the Ryukyu Islands is from the Stone Age and was discovered in Naha and Yaeyama. Some human bone fragments thought to be from the Paleolithic era were unearthed from a site in Naha, but the artifact was lost in transportation before it was examined. Japanese Jōmon influences are dominant on the Okinawa Islands, although clay vessels on the Sakishima Islands have a commonality with those in Taiwan.

The first mention of the word &quot;Ryukyu&quot; was written in the &quot;Book of Sui&quot;. &quot;Okinawa&quot; was the Japanese word identifying the islands, first seen in the biography of Jianzhen, written in 779. Agricultural societies begun in the 8th century slowly developed until the 12th century. Since the islands are located at the eastern perimeter of the East China Sea relatively close to Japan, China and Southeast Asia, the Ryukyu Kingdom became a prosperous trading nation. Also during this period, many Gusukus, similar to castles, were constructed. The Ryukyu Kingdom entered into the Imperial Chinese tributary system under the Ming dynasty beginning in the 15th century, which established economic relations between the two nations.

In 1609, the Shimazu clan, which controlled the region that is now Kagoshima Prefecture, invaded the Ryukyu Kingdom. The Ryukyu Kingdom was obliged to agree to form a suzerain-vassal relationship with the Satsuma and the Tokugawa shogunate, while maintaining its previous role within the Chinese tributary system; Ryukyuan sovereignty was maintained since complete annexation would have created a conflict with China. The Satsuma clan earned considerable profits from trade with China during a period in which foreign trade was heavily restricted by the shogunate. Although Satsuma maintained strong influence over the islands, the Ryukyu Kingdom maintained a considerable degree of domestic political freedom for over two hundred years.

Four years after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government, through military incursions, officially annexed the kingdom and renamed it Ryukyu han. At the time, the Qing dynasty asserted a nominal suzerainty over the islands. Ryukyu han became Okinawa Prefecture of Japan in 1879, even though all other hans had become prefectures of Japan in 1872. In 1912, Okinawans first obtained the right to vote for representatives to the which had been established in 1890.

===U.S. administration (1945–1972)===
On April 1, 1945, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps launched an invasion of Okinawa with 185,000 troops. They were faced with fanatical resistance from the Japanese defenders. A third of Okinawa&#x27;s civilian population were killed during the ensuing fighting. The dead, of all nationalities, are commemorated at the Cornerstone of Peace.

After the end of World War II, the United States set up the United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands, which later became the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands. The United States established numerous military bases on the Ryukyu Islands during its 27-year-long &quot;trusteeship rule&quot;. The Ryukyu independence movement was an Okinawan movement that clamored against U.S. rule.

====Continued U.S. military buildup====
During the Korean War, B-29 Superfortresses flew bombing missions over Korea from Kadena Air Base on Okinawa. The military buildup on the island during the Cold War increased a division between local inhabitants and the American military. Under the 1952 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, United States Forces Japan (USFJ) have maintained a large military presence.
During the mid-1950s, the U.S. seized land from Okinawans to build new bases or expand currently existing ones. According to the Melvin Price Report, by 1955, the military had displaced 250,000 residents.

====Secret U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons====
Since 1960, the U.S. and Japan have maintained an agreement that allows the U.S. to secretly bring nuclear weapons into Japanese ports. The Japanese people tended to oppose the introduction of nuclear arms into Japanese territory and the Japanese government&#x27;s assertion of Japan&#x27;s non-nuclear policy and a statement of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles reflected this popular opposition. Most of the weapons were alleged to be stored in ammunition bunkers at Kadena Air Base. Between 1954 and 1972, 19 different types of nuclear weapons were deployed in Okinawa, but with fewer than around 1,000 warheads at any one time. In fall 1960, U.S. commandos in Green Light Teams secret training missions carried small nuclear weapons on the east coast of Okinawa Island.

==== Vietnam War ====
Between 1965 and 1972, Okinawa was a key staging point for United States in its military operations directed towards North Vietnam. Along with Guam, it presented a geographically strategic launch pad for covert bombing missions over Cambodia and Laos. Anti-Vietnam War sentiment became linked politically to the movement for reversion of Okinawa to Japan. In 1965, the U.S. military bases, earlier viewed as paternal post war protection, were increasingly seen as aggressive. The Vietnam War highlighted the differences between United States and Okinawa but showed a commonality between the islands and mainland Japan.

As controversy grew regarding the alleged placement of nuclear weapons on Okinawa, fears intensified over the escalation of the Vietnam War. Okinawa was perceived by some inside Japan as a potential target for China, should the communist government feel threatened by United States. American military secrecy blocked any local reporting on what was actually occurring at bases such as Kadena Air Base. As information leaked out, and images of air strikes were published, the local population began to fear the potential for retaliation.

Political leaders such as Makoto Oda, a major figure in the Beheiren movement (Foundation of Citizens for Peace in Vietnam), believed that the return of Okinawa to Japan would lead to the removal of U.S. forces, ending Japan&#x27;s involvement in Vietnam. In a speech delivered in 1967, Oda was critical of Prime Minister Eisaku Satō&#x27;s unilateral support of America&#x27;s war in Vietnam, claiming &quot;Realistically we are all guilty of complicity in the Vietnam War&quot;. The Beheiren became a more visible anti-war movement on Okinawa as the American involvement in Vietnam intensified. The movement employed tactics ranging from demonstrations to handing leaflets to soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines directly, warning of the implications for a third World War.

The U.S. military bases on Okinawa became a focal point for anti-Vietnam War sentiment. By 1969, over 50,000 American military personnel were stationed on Okinawa. United States Department of Defense began referring to Okinawa as the &quot;Keystone of the Pacific&quot;. This slogan was imprinted on local U.S. military license plates.

In 1969, chemicals leaked from the U.S. storage depot at Chibana in central Okinawa, under Operation Red Hat. Evacuations of residents took place over a wide area for two months. Even two years later, government investigators found that Okinawans and the environment near the leak were still suffering because of the depot.

On May 15, 1972, the U.S. government returned the islands to Japan following the signing of the 1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement.

===Post-reversion history (1972–present)===
The 1995 kidnaping, beating, and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three U.S. servicemen triggered widespread protests in Okinawa. Reports by the local media of accidents and crimes committed by U.S. servicemen have reduced the local population&#x27;s support for the U.S. military bases. A strong emotional response has emerged from certain incidents. As a result, the media has drawn renewed interest in the Ryukyu independence movement.

Documents declassified in 1997 proved that both tactical and strategic weapons have been maintained in Okinawa. In 1999 and 2002, the &quot;Japan Times&quot; and the &quot;Okinawa Times&quot; reported speculation that not all weapons were removed from Okinawa. On October 25, 2005, after a decade of negotiations, the governments of the U.S. and Japan officially agreed to move Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from its location in the densely populated city of Ginowan to the more northerly and remote Camp Schwab in Nago by building a heliport with a shorter runway, partly on Camp Schwab land and partly running into the sea. The move is partly an attempt to relieve tensions between the people of Okinawa and the Marine Corps.

Despite Okinawa prefecture constituting only 0.6% of Japan&#x27;s land surface, in 2006 75% of all USFJ bases were located on Okinawa, occupying 18% of the main island.

According to a 2007 &quot;Okinawa Times&quot; poll, 85% of Okinawans opposed the presence of the U.S. military, because of noise pollution from military drills, the risk of aircraft accidents, environmental degradation, and crowding from the number of personnel there, although 73% of Japanese citizens appreciated the mutual security treaty with the U.S. and the presence of the USFJ. In another poll conducted by &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot; in May 2010, 43% of the Okinawan population wanted the complete closure of the U.S. bases, 42% wanted reduction, and 11% wanted to maintain status quo. Okinawan feelings about the U.S. military are complex, and some of the resentment towards the U.S. bases is directed towards the government in Tokyo, perceived as being insensitive to Okinawan needs and using Okinawa to house bases not desired elsewhere in Japan.

In early 2008, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice apologized after a series of crimes involving American troops in Japan, including the rape of a young girl of 14 by a Marine on Okinawa. The U.S. military imposed a temporary 24-hour curfew on military personnel and their families to ease the anger of local residents. Some cited statistics that the crime rate of military personnel is consistently less than that of the general Okinawan population. However, some criticized the statistics as unreliable, since violence against women is under-reported. Between 1972 and 2009, U.S. servicemen committed 5,634 criminal offenses, including 25 murders, 385 burglaries, 25 arsons, 127 rapes, 306 assaults and 2,827 thefts. Yet, per Marine Corps Installations Pacific data, U.S. service members are convicted of far fewer crimes than local Okinawans.

In 2009, a new Japanese government came to power and froze the U.S. forces relocation plan but in April 2010 indicated their interest in resolving the issue by proposing a modified plan. A study done in 2010 found that the prolonged exposure to aircraft noise around the Kadena Air Base and other military bases cause health issues such as a disrupted sleep pattern, high blood pressure, weakening of the immune system in children, and a loss of hearing.

In 2011, it was reported that the U.S. military—contrary to repeated denials by The Pentagon—had kept tens of thousands of barrels of Agent Orange on the island. The Japanese and American governments have angered some U.S. veterans, who believe they were poisoned by Agent Orange while serving on the island, by characterizing their statements regarding Agent Orange as &quot;dubious&quot;, and ignoring their requests for compensation. Reports that more than a third of the barrels developed leaks have led Okinawans to ask for environmental investigations, but both Tokyo and Washington refused such action. Jon Mitchell has reported concern that the U.S. used American Marines as chemical-agent guinea pigs.

On September 30, 2018, Denny Tamaki was elected as the next governor of Okinawa prefecture, after a campaign focused on sharply reducing the U.S. military presence on the island.

==== Marine Corps Air Station Futenma relocation ====
In 2006, some 8,000 U.S. Marines were removed from the island and relocated to Guam. The move to Marine Corps Base Camp Blaz was expected to be completed in 2023 but as of 1 January 2025 is still in process. Japan paid for a majority of the cost to construct the new base. The U.S. still maintains Air Force, Marine, Navy, and Army military installations on the islands. These bases include Kadena Air Base, Camp Foster, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Camp Hansen, Camp Schwab, Torii Station, Camp Kinser, and Camp Gonsalves. The area of 14 U.S. bases are , occupying 18% of the main island. Okinawa hosts about two-thirds of the 50,000 American forces in Japan although the islands account for less than one percent of total lands in Japan.

Suburbs have grown towards and now surround two historic major bases, Futenma and Kadena. A sizable portion of the land used by the U.S. military is Camp Gonsalves in the north of the island. On December 21, 2016, 10,000 acres of Camp Gonsalves were returned to Japan. On June 25, 2018, Okinawa residents held a protest demonstration at sea against scheduled land reclamation work for the relocation of a U.S. military base within Japan&#x27;s southernmost island prefecture. A protest gathered hundreds of people.

Since the early 2000s, Okinawans have opposed the presence of American troops helipads in the Takae zone of the Yanbaru forest near Higashi and Kunigami. This opposition grew in July 2016 after the construction of six new helipads.

==Geography==
===Major islands===
The islands comprising the prefecture are the southern two thirds of the archipelago of the . Okinawa&#x27;s inhabited islands are typically divided into three geographical archipelagos. From northeast to southwest:

===Natural parks===
Approximately 36% percent of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as natural parks, namely the Iriomote-Ishigaki, Kerama Shotō, and Yambaru National Parks; Okinawa Kaigan and Okinawa Senseki Quasi-National Parks; and Irabu, Kumejima, Tarama, and Tonaki Prefectural Natural Parks.

===Ecology===
The dugong is an endangered marine mammal related to the manatee. Iriomote is home to one of the world&#x27;s rarest and most endangered cat species, the Iriomote cat. The region is also home to at least one endemic pit viper, &quot;Trimeresurus elegans&quot;. The islands of Okinawa are surrounded by some of the most abundant coral reefs found in the world. The world&#x27;s largest colony of rare blue coral is found off Ishigaki Island. The sea turtles return yearly to the southern islands of Okinawa to lay their eggs. The summer months carry warnings to swimmers regarding venomous jellyfish and other dangerous sea creatures.

Okinawa is a major producer of sugar cane, pineapple, papaya, and other tropical fruit, and the Southeast Botanical Gardens represent tropical plant species.

===Geology===
The island is largely composed of coral, and rainwater filtering through that coral has given the island many caves, which played an important role in the Battle of Okinawa. Gyokusendo is an extensive limestone cave in the southern part of Okinawa&#x27;s main island.

===Climate===
The island experiences temperatures above for most of the year. The climate of the islands ranges from humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) in the north, such as Okinawa Island, to tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;) in the south such as Iriomote Island. Snowfall is unheard of at sea level. However, on January 24, 2016, sleet was reported in Nago for the first time on record.

==Municipalities==

===Cities===


Eleven cities are located within the Okinawa Prefecture:
===Towns and villages===
These are the towns and villages in each district:
===Town mergers===
==Demography==
=== Ethnic groups ===
The indigenous Ryukyuans make up the majority of Okinawa Prefecture&#x27;s population and are also the main ethnic group of the Amami Islands to the north. Large Okinawan diaspora communities persist in places such as South America and Hawaii. With the introduction of American military bases, there are an increasing number of half-American children in Okinawa, including prefecture governor Denny Tamaki. The prefecture also has a sizable minority of Yamato people from mainland Japan; exact population numbers are difficult to establish, as the Japanese government does not officially recognize Ryukyuans as a distinct ethnic group from Yamatos.

The overall ethnic identity of Okinawa residents is rather split. According to a telephone poll conducted by Lim John Chuan-tiong (林泉忠), an associate professor with the University of the Ryukyus, 40.6% of respondents identified as &quot; (Okinawan)&quot;, 21.3% identified as &quot; (Japanese)&quot; and 36.5% identified as both.

Per Japanese census data, Okinawa prefecture has had continuous positive population growth since 1960.

==Language==
There remain six Ryukyuan languages which, although related, are incomprehensible to speakers of Japanese. One of the Ryukyuan languages is spoken in Kagoshima Prefecture, rather than in Okinawa Prefecture. These languages are in decline as the younger generation of Okinawans uses Standard Japanese. Mainland Japanese and some Okinawans generally perceive the Ryukyuan languages as &quot;dialects&quot;. Standard Japanese is almost always used in formal situations. In informal situations, &quot;de facto&quot; everyday language among Okinawans under age 60 is Okinawa-accented mainland Japanese (&quot;Okinawan Japanese&quot;), which is often mistaken by non-Okinawans as the Okinawan language proper. The actual traditional Okinawan language is still used in traditional cultural activities, such as folk music and folk dance. There is a radio-news program in the language as well.

==Culture==
Having been a separate nation until 1879, Okinawan language and culture differ in many ways from those of mainland Japan. Okinawan culture bears traces of its various trading partners. One can find Chinese, Thai and Austronesian influences in the island&#x27;s customs. Perhaps Okinawa&#x27;s most famous cultural export is karate, probably a product of the close ties with and influence of China on Okinawan culture. Karate is thought to be a synthesis of Chinese kung fu with traditional Okinawan martial arts.

A cultural feature of the Okinawans is the forming of &quot;moais&quot;. A is a community social gathering and groups that come together to provide financial and emotional support through emotional bonding, advice giving, and social funding. This provides a sense of security for the community members and as mentioned in the Blue Zone studies, may have been a contributing factor to the longevity of its people. However, in recent decades Okinawans&#x27; life expectancy has fallen significantly (also bringing into question the general validity of the &#x27;Blue Zones&#x27; denominaton), which often has been blamed on cultural influence from the rest of Japan, as well as foreign influences on Okinawans&#x27; lifestyle.

Two Okinawan writers have received the Akutagawa Prize: Eiki Matayoshi in 1995 for and Shun Medoruma in 1997 for &quot;A Drop of Water&quot; (&quot;Suiteki&quot;). The prize was also won by Okinawans in 1967 by Tatsuhiro Oshiro for &quot;Cocktail Party&quot; () and in 1971 by Mineo Higashi for &quot;Okinawan Boy&quot; ().

A traditional craft, the fabric named bingata, is made in workshops on the main island and elsewhere.

===Music===

The music of the prefecture contains native and imported influences in both &quot;koten&quot; (classical) and &quot;min&#x27;yō&quot; (folk) styles. Okinawan instruments include the sanshin—a three-stringed banjo-like instrument, closely related to the Chinese sanxian, and ancestor of the Japanese shamisen. Its body is often bound with snakeskin (from pythons, imported from elsewhere in Asia, rather than from Okinawa&#x27;s venomous habu, which are too small for this purpose). Okinawan musical cultures integrate dance with music, such as in eisa, a traditional drumming dance.

===Religion===

Okinawans have traditionally followed Ryukyuan religious beliefs, generally characterized by ancestor worship and the respecting of relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods and spirits of the natural world.

===Cuisine and diet===
The Okinawan diet consists of low-fat, low-salt foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, tofu, and seaweed. Okinawans are particularly well known for consuming purple potatoes, also known as Okinawan sweet potatoes. Okinawans used to be known for their longevity compared to the rest of Japan and the world in general. This particular island is a so-called Blue Zone, an area where people are purported to live longer than most others elsewhere in the world. Possible explanations for this were diet, low-stress lifestyle, caring community, activity, and spirituality of the inhabitants of the island.

A traditional Okinawan product that owes its existence to Okinawa&#x27;s trading history is awamori—an Okinawan distilled spirit made from &quot;indica&quot; rice imported from Thailand.

===Architecture===
Despite widespread destruction during World War II, there are many remains of a unique type of castle or fortress known as &quot;gusuku&quot;; the most significant are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List (Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu). In addition, twenty-three Ryukyuan architectural complexes and forty historic sites have been designated for protection by the national government. Shuri Castle in Naha is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Whereas most homes in Japan are made from wood and allow free-flow of air to combat humidity, typical modern homes in Okinawa are made from concrete with barred windows to protect from flying plant debris and to withstand regular typhoons. Roofs are designed with strong winds in mind, in which each tile is cemented on and not merely layered as seen with many homes in Japan. The Nakamura House () is an original 18th century farmhouse in Kitanakagusuki. Many roofs also display a lion-dog statue, called a shisa, which is said to protect the home from danger. Roofs are typically red in color and are inspired by Chinese design.

==Education==
The public schools in Okinawa are overseen by the Okinawa Prefectural Board of Education. The agency directly operates several public high schools including Okinawa Shogaku High School. The U.S. Department of Defense Dependents Schools operates 13 schools total in Okinawa. Seven of these schools are located on Kadena Air Base.

Okinawa has many types of private schools. Some of them are cram schools, also known as juku. Others, such as Nova, solely teach language. There are 10 colleges/universities in Okinawa, including the University of the Ryukyus, the only national university in the prefecture, and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, a new international research institute. Okinawa&#x27;s American military bases also host the Asian Division of the University of Maryland University College.

==Sports==

=== Martial arts ===

Martial arts, such as tegumi and Okinawan kobudō originated among the indigenous people of Okinawa Island. Due to its central location, Okinawa was influenced by various cultures including Japan, China and Southeast Asia in its martial arts culture.

==== Karate ====

Karate originated in the Ryukyu Kingdom, under Chinese influence. Over time, it developed into several styles and sub-styles. On Okinawa, the three main styles are considered to be Shōrin-ryū, Gōjū-ryū and Uechi-ryū. Internationally, the various styles and sub-styles include Matsubayashi-ryū, Wadō-ryū, Isshin-ryū, Shōrinkan, Shotokan, Shitō-ryū, Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan, Shorinjiryu Koshinkai, and Shōrinji-ryū.

Following Okinawa&#x27;s occupation, karate spread to the United States and the rest of the world. It is now popular across the world, and has since been included in the Olympic Games.

=== Association football ===
FC Ryukyu is a professional football team based on Okinawa. Since 2014 they have competed in the second or third tier in the national league system.

=== Basketball ===

The Ryukyu Golden Kings are a professional basketball team that compete in the B.League, the top-tier professional basketball league of Japan. They are successful, having won the national title five times (most recently in 2023).

The Okinawa Arena has hosted the Japanese men&#x27;s basketball team for various 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers. It was also one of five venues to host the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, the other four were in the Philippines and Indonesia.

=== Handball ===
* Ryukyu Corazon (Naha)

=== Baseball ===
Announced on July 18, 2019, BASE Okinawa Baseball Club will be forming the first-ever professional baseball team on Okinawa, the Ryukyu Blue Oceans. The team is expected to be fully organized by January 2020 and intends on joining the Nippon Professional Baseball league.

In addition, various baseball teams from Japan hold training during the winter in Okinawa prefecture as it is the warmest prefecture of Japan with no snow and higher temperatures than other prefectures.

==Economy==
The 34 U.S. military installations on Okinawa are financially supported by the U.S. and Japan. The bases provide jobs for Okinawans, both directly and indirectly; in 2011, the U.S. military employed over 9,800 Japanese workers in Okinawa. the bases accounted for up to 5% of the economy. However, Koji Taira argued in 1997 that because the U.S. bases occupy around 20% of Okinawa&#x27;s land, they impose a deadweight loss of 15% on the Okinawan economy. The Tokyo government also pays the prefectural government around ¥10 billion per year in compensation for the American presence, including, for instance, rent paid by the Japanese government to the Okinawans on whose land American bases are situated. A 2005 report by the U.S. Forces Japan Okinawa Area Field Office estimated that in 2003 the combined U.S. and Japanese base-related spending contributed $1.9 billion to the local economy. On January 13, 2015, in response to the citizens electing governor Takeshi Onaga, the national government announced that Okinawa&#x27;s funding will be cut, due to the governor&#x27;s stance on removing the US military bases from Okinawa, which the national government does not want happening.

The Okinawa Convention and Visitors Bureau is exploring the possibility of using facilities on the military bases for large-scale meetings, conferencing, exhibitions events.

<text>Olive oil is a liquid fat obtained by pressing whole olives, the fruit of &quot;Olea europaea&quot;, a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin, and extracting the oil.

It is commonly used in cooking for frying foods, as a condiment, or as a salad dressing. It can also be found in some cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, soaps, and fuels for traditional oil lamps. It also has additional uses in some religions. The olive is one of three core food plants in Mediterranean cuisine, together with wheat and grapes. Olive trees have been cultivated around the Mediterranean since the 8th millennium BC.

In 2022, Spain was the world&#x27;s largest producer, manufacturing 24% of the world total. Other large producers were Italy, Greece, and Turkey, collectively accounting for 59% of the global market.

The composition of olive oil varies with the cultivar, altitude, time of harvest, and extraction process. It consists mainly of oleic acid (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of other fatty acids including linoleic acid (up to 21%) and palmitic acid (up to 20%). Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is required to have no more than 0.8% free acidity, and is considered to have favorable flavor characteristics.

== History ==

Olive oil has long been a common ingredient in Mediterranean cuisine, including ancient Greek and Roman cuisine. Wild olives, which originated in Asia Minor, were collected by Neolithic people as early as the 8th millennium BC. Besides food, olive oil has been used for religious rituals, medicines, as a fuel in oil lamps, soap-making, and skincare application. The Spartans and other Greeks used oil to rub themselves while exercising in the gymnasia. From its beginnings early in the 7th century BC, the cosmetic use of olive oil quickly spread to all of the Hellenic city-states, together with athletes training in the nude, and lasted close to a thousand years despite its great expense. Olive oil was also popular as a form of birth control; Aristotle in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; recommends applying a mixture of olive oil combined with either oil of cedar, ointment of lead, or ointment of frankincense to the cervix to prevent pregnancy.

=== Early cultivation ===
It is not clear when and where olive trees were first domesticated. The modern olive tree may have originated in ancient Persia and Mesopotamia and spread to the Levant and later to North Africa, though some scholars argue for an Egyptian origin.

The olive tree reached Greece, Carthage and Libya sometime in the 28th century BC, having been spread westward by the Phoenicians. Until around 1500 BC, eastern coastal areas of the Mediterranean were most heavily cultivated. Evidence also suggests that olives were being grown in Crete as long ago as 2500 BC. The earliest surviving olive oil amphorae date to 3500 BC (Early Minoan times), though the production of olive oil is assumed to have started before 4000 BC. Olive trees were certainly cultivated by the Late Minoan period (1500 BC) in Crete, and perhaps as early as the Early Minoan. The cultivation of olive trees in Crete became particularly intense in the post-palatial period and played an important role in the island&#x27;s economy, as it did across the Mediterranean. Later, as Greek colonies were established in other parts of the Mediterranean, olive farming was introduced to places like Spain and continued to spread throughout the Roman Empire.

Olive trees were introduced to the Americas in the 16th century, when cultivation began in areas with a climate similar to the Mediterranean, such as Chile, Argentina, and California.

Recent genetic studies suggest that species used by modern cultivators descend from multiple wild populations, but detailed history of domestication is unknown.

=== Trade and production ===
Archaeological evidence in Galilee shows that by 6000 BC olives were being turned into olive oil and in 4500 BC at a now-submerged prehistoric settlement south of Haifa.

Olive trees and oil production in the Eastern Mediterranean can be traced to archives of the ancient city-state Ebla (2600–2240 BC), which were located on the outskirts of Aleppo. Here some dozen documents dated 2400 BC describe the lands of the king and the queen. These belonged to a library of clay tablets perfectly preserved by having been baked in the fire that destroyed the palace. A later source is the frequent mentions of oil in the Tanakh.

Dynastic Egyptians before 2000 BC imported olive oil from Crete, Syria and Canaan, and oil was an important item of commerce and wealth. Remains of olive oil have been found in jugs over 4,000 years old in a tomb on the island of Naxos in the Aegean Sea. Sinuhe, the Egyptian exile who lived in northern Canaan c.1960 BC, wrote of abundant olive trees. The Minoans used olive oil in religious ceremonies. The oil became a principal product of the Minoan civilization, where it is thought to have represented wealth.

Olive oil was also a major export of Mycenaean Greece (c. 1450–1150 BC). Scholars believe the oil was made by a process where olives were placed in woven mats and squeezed. The oil was collected in vats. This process was known from the Bronze Age, was used by the Egyptians, and continued to be used through the Hellenistic period.

The importance of olive oil as a commercial commodity increased after the Roman conquest of Egypt, Greece and Asia Minor led to more trade along the Mediterranean. Olive trees were planted throughout the entire Mediterranean basin during evolution of the Roman Republic and Empire. According to the historian Pliny the Elder, Italy had &quot;excellent olive oil at reasonable prices&quot; by the 1st century AD—&quot;the best in the Mediterranean&quot;. As olive production expanded in the 5th century AD the Romans began to employ more sophisticated production techniques such as the olive press and &quot;trapetum&quot; (pictured left). Many ancient presses still exist in the Eastern Mediterranean region, and some dating to the Roman period are still in use today. Productivity was greatly improved by Joseph Graham&#x27;s development of the hydraulic pressing system in 1795.

=== Symbolism and mythology ===
The olive tree has historically been a symbol of peace between nations. It has played a religious and social role in Greek mythology, especially concerning the city of Athens, named after the goddess Athena because her gift of an olive tree was held to be more precious than rival Poseidon&#x27;s gift of a salt spring.

== Varieties ==
There are many olive cultivars, each with a particular flavor, texture, and shelf life that make them more or less suitable for different applications, such as direct human consumption on bread or in salads, indirect consumption in domestic cooking or catering, or industrial uses such as animal feed or engineering applications. During the stages of maturity, olive fruit changes color from green to violet, and then black. Olive oil taste characteristics depend on the stage of ripeness at which olive fruits are collected.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary use ===
Olive oil is an important cooking oil in countries surrounding the Mediterranean, and it forms one of the three staple food plants of Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat (as in pasta, bread, and couscous), and the grape, used as a dessert fruit and for wine.

Extra virgin olive oil is mostly used raw as a condiment and as an ingredient in salad dressings. If uncompromised by heat, the flavor is stronger. It also can be used for sautéing.

When extra virgin olive oil is heated above , depending on its free fatty acid content, the unrefined particles within the oil are burned. This leads to deteriorated taste. Refined olive oils are suited for deep frying because of the higher smoke point and milder flavour. Extra virgin oils have a smoke point around , with higher-quality oils having a higher smoke point, whereas refined light olive oil has a smoke point up to . That they can be used for deep frying is contrary to the common misconception that there are no olive oils with a smoke point as high as many other vegetable oils. In the misconception, heating at these high heats is theorised to impact taste or nutrition.

=== Religious use ===

==== Christianity ====
The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican churches use olive oil for the oil of catechumens (used to bless and strengthen those preparing for baptism) and oil of the sick (used to confer the Sacrament of anointing of the sick or extreme unction). Olive oil mixed with a perfuming agent such as balsam is consecrated by bishops as sacred chrism, which is used to confer the sacrament of confirmation (as a symbol of the strengthening of the Holy Spirit), in the rites of baptism and the ordination of priests and bishops, in the consecration of altars and churches, and, traditionally, in the anointing of monarchs at their coronation.

Eastern Orthodox Christians still use oil lamps in their churches, home prayer corners, and cemeteries. A vigil lamp consists of a votive glass filled with olive oil, floating on a half-inch of water. The glass has a metal holder that hangs from a bracket on the wall or sits on a table. A cork float with a lit wick floats on the oil. To douse the flame, the float is carefully pressed down into the oil. Makeshift oil lamps can easily be made by soaking a ball of cotton in olive oil and forming it into a peak. The peak is lit and then burns until all the oil is consumed, whereupon the rest of the cotton burns out. Olive oil is a usual offering to churches and cemeteries.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses virgin olive oil that has been blessed by the priesthood for anointing the sick.

==== Judaism ====
In Jewish observance, olive oil was the only fuel allowed to be used in the seven-branched menorah in the Mishkan service during the Exodus of the Tribes of Israel from Egypt, and later in the permanent Temple in Jerusalem. It was obtained by using only the first drop from a squeezed olive and was consecrated for use only in the Temple by the priests and stored in special containers. In modern times, although candles can be used to light the menorah at Hanukkah, oil containers are preferred, to imitate the original menorah.

In Judaism of Ancient Israel, olive oil was also used to prepare the holy anointing oil used for priests, kings, prophets, and others.

=== Other ===

Olive oil is also a natural and safe lubricant, and can be used to lubricate kitchen machinery (grinders, blenders, cookware, etc.). It can also be used for illumination (oil lamps) or as the base for soaps and detergents. Some cosmetics also use olive oil as their base, and it can be used as a substitute for machine oil. Olive oil has also been used as both solvent and ligand in the synthesis of cadmium selenide quantum dots.

The Ranieri Filo della Torre is an international literary prize for writings about extra virgin olive oil. It yearly honors poetry, fiction and non-fiction about extra virgin olive oil.

== Extraction ==


Olive oil is produced by grinding olives and extracting the oil by mechanical or chemical means. Green olives usually produce more bitter oil, and overripe olives can produce oil with fermentation defects, so for good olive oil care is taken to make sure the olives are perfectly ripe. The process is generally as follows:

# The olives are ground into paste using large millstones (traditional method), hammer, blade or disk mill (modern method).
# If ground with millstones, the olive paste generally stays under the stones for 30 to 40 minutes. A shorter grinding process may result in a more raw paste that produces less oil and has a less ripe taste, a longer process may increase oxidation of the paste and reduce the flavor. After grinding, the olive paste is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked on top of each other in a column, then placed into the press. Pressure is then applied onto the column to separate the vegetal liquid from the paste. This liquid still contains a significant amount of water. Traditionally the oil was shed from the water by gravity (oil is less dense than water). This very slow separation process has been replaced by centrifugation, which is much faster and more thorough. The centrifuges have one exit for the (heavier) watery part and one for the oil. Olive oil should not contain significant traces of vegetal water as this accelerates the process of organic degeneration by microorganisms. The separation in smaller oil mills is not always perfect, thus sometimes a small watery deposit containing organic particles can be found at the bottom of oil bottles.
# Modern grinders reduce the olives to paste in seconds. After grinding, the paste is stirred slowly for another 20 to 30 minutes in a particular container (malaxation), where the microscopic oil drops aggregate into bigger drops, which facilitates the mechanical extraction. The paste is then pressed by centrifugation/ the water is thereafter separated from the oil in a second centrifugation as described before.The oil produced by only physical (mechanical) means as described above is called virgin oil. Extra virgin olive oil is virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria (low free acidity, no or very little organoleptic defects). A higher grade extra virgin olive oil is mostly dependent on favourable weather conditions; a drought during the flowering phase, for example, can result in a lower quality (virgin) oil. Olive trees produce well every couple of years, so greater harvests occur in alternate years (the year in-between is when the tree yields less). However the quality is still dependent on the weather.
# Sometimes the produced oil will be filtered to eliminate remaining solid particles that may reduce the shelf life of the product. Labels may indicate the fact that the oil has &quot;not&quot; been filtered, suggesting a different taste. Fresh unfiltered olive oil usually has a slightly cloudy appearance, and is therefore sometimes called &quot;cloudy olive oil&quot;. This form of olive oil used to be popular only among small scale producers but is now becoming &quot;trendy&quot;, in line with consumer&#x27;s demand for products that are perceived to be less processed. But generally, if not tasted or consumed soon after production, filtered olive oil should be preferred: &quot;Some producers maintain that extra-virgin olive oils do not need filtration but also that filtration is detrimental to oil quality. This point of view should be considered as erroneous and probably the result of improper implementation of this operation. In fact, fine particles that are suspended in a virgin olive oil, even after the most effective centrifugal finishing, contain water and enzymes that may impair oil stability and ruin its sensory profile. ... Filtration makes an extra-virgin olive oil more stable and also more attractive. If the suspended particles are not removed they slowly agglomerate and flocculate, forming a deposit on the bottom of the storage containers. Such a deposit continues to be at risk of enzymatic spoilage and, in the worst case, of development of anaerobic micro-organisms with further spoilage and hygienic risk. ... It is ... recommended that filtration be carried out as soon as possible after centrifugal separation and finishing.&quot;

===Ancient Levant===
In the ancient Levant, three methods were used to produce different grades of olive oil. The finest oil was produced from fully developed and ripe olives harvested solely from the apex of the tree, and lightly pressed, &quot;for what flows from light pressure is very sweet and very thin&quot;. The remaining olives are pressed with a heavier weight, and vary in ripeness. Inferior oil is produced from unripe olives that are stored for extended periods of time until they grow soft or begin to shrivel to become more fit for grinding. Others are left for extended periods in pits in the ground to induce sweating and decay before they are ground. According to the &quot;Geoponica&quot;, salt and a little nitre are added when oil is stored.

In countries of the levant, a sharp-tasting green oil was sometimes extracted from unripe olives, known in medieval times as &quot;anpeqinon&quot; (; ), being a corruption of the Latin words and used in cuisine and in medicine. Today, this oil is called &quot;virgin oil&quot; in English.

===Pomace handling===

The remaining semi-solid waste, called pomace, retains a small quantity (about 5–10%) of oil that cannot be extracted by further pressing, but only with chemical solvents. This is done in specialized chemical plants, not in the oil mills. The resulting oil is named pomace oil.

Handling of olive waste is an environmental challenge because the wastewater, which amounts to millions of tons (billions of liters) annually in the European Union, has low biodegradability, is toxic to plants, and cannot be processed through conventional water treatment systems. Traditionally, olive pomace would be used as compost or developed as a possible biofuel, although these uses introduce concern due to chemicals present in the pomace. A process called &quot;valorization&quot; of olive pomace is under research and development, consisting of additional processing to obtain value-added byproducts, such as animal feed, food additives for human products, and phenolic and fatty acid extracts for potential human use.

==Global market==
=== Production ===
In 2022, world production of olive oil was 2.7 million tonnes, led by Spain with 24% of the total (table). Other major producers were Italy, Greece, and Turkey (table). 

Villacarrillo, Jaén, Andalucía, Spain is a center of olive oil production. Spain&#x27;s olive oil production derives 75% from the region of Andalucía, particularly within Jaén province which produces 70% of the olive oil in Spain. The world&#x27;s largest olive oil mill (&quot;almazara&quot;, in Spanish), capable of processing 2,500 tonnes of olives per day, is in the town of Villacarrillo, Jaén. 

Italian major producers are the regions of Calabria and, above all, Apulia. Many PDO and PGI extra-virgin olive oil are produced in these regions. Extra-virgin olive oil is also produced in Tuscany, in cities including Lucca, Florence, and Siena, which are also included in the association of Città dell&#x27;Olio. Italy imports about 65% of Spanish olive oil exports.

=== Global consumption ===
Greece has by far the largest per capita consumption of olive oil worldwide, around 24 liters per year. Consumption in Spain is 15 liters; Italy 13 liters; and Israel, around 3 liters. Canada consumes 1.5 liters and the US 1 liter.

== Regulation ==
The International Olive Council (IOC) is an intergovernmental organisation of states that produce olives or products derived from olives, such as olive oil. The IOC officially governs 95% of international production and holds great influence over the rest. The EU regulates the use of different protected designation of origin labels for olive oils.

The United States is not a member of the IOC and is not subject to its authority, but on October 25, 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture adopted new voluntary olive oil grading standards that closely parallel those of the IOC, with some adjustments for the characteristics of olives grown in the U.S. U.S. Customs regulations on &quot;country of origin&quot; state that if a non-origin nation is shown on the label, then the real origin must be shown on the same side of the label in letters of comparable size, so as not to mislead the consumer. Yet most major U.S. brands continue to put &quot;imported from Italy&quot; on the front label in large letters and other origins on the back in very small print. &quot;In fact, olive oil labeled &#x27;Italian&#x27; often comes from Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, and Greece.&quot; This makes it unclear what percentage of the olive oil is really of Italian origin.

=== Commercial grades ===

All production begins by transforming the olive fruit into olive paste by crushing or pressing. This paste is malaxed (slowly churned or mixed) to allow the microscopic oil droplets to agglomerate. The oil is then separated from the watery matter and fruit pulp with the use of a press (traditional method) or centrifugation (modern method). The residue that remains after pressing or centrifugation can also produce a small amount of oil, called pomace.

One parameter used to characterise an oil is its acidity. In this context, &quot;acidity&quot; is not chemical acidity in the sense of pH, but the percent (measured by weight) of free oleic acid. Olive oil acidity is a measure of the hydrolysis of the oil&#x27;s triglycerides: as the oil degrades and becomes oxidized, more fatty acids are freed from the glycerides, increasing the level of free acidity and thereby increasing hydrolytic rancidity. Rancidity not only impacts the taste and color but also its nutritional value.

Another measure of the oil&#x27;s chemical degradation is the peroxide value, which measures the degree to which the oil is oxidized by free radicals, leading to &quot;oxidative&quot; rancidity. Phenolic acids present in olive oil also add acidic sensory properties to aroma and flavor.

The grades of oil extracted from the olive fruit can be classified as:
* &quot;Virgin&quot; means the oil was produced by the use of mechanical means only, with no chemical treatment. The term &quot;virgin oil&quot; with reference to production method includes all grades of virgin olive oil, including &quot;extra virgin&quot;, &quot;virgin&quot;, &quot;ordinary virgin&quot; and &quot;Lampante virgin&quot; olive oil products, depending on quality (see below).
* &quot;Lampante virgin oil&quot; is olive oil extracted by virgin (mechanical) methods but not suitable for human consumption without further refining; &quot;lampante&quot; is the attributive form of &quot;lampa&quot;, the Italian word for &quot;lamp&quot;, referring to the use of such oil in oil lamps. Lampante virgin oil can be used for industrial purposes, or refined (see below) to make it edible.
* &quot;Refined olive oil&quot; is the olive oil obtained from any grade of virgin olive oil by refining methods which do not lead to alterations in the initial glyceridic structure. The refining process removes color, odor and flavour from the olive oil, and leaves behind a very pure form of olive oil that is tasteless, colorless and odorless and extremely low in free fatty acids. Olive oils sold as the grades &quot;extra virgin olive oil&quot; and &quot;virgin olive oil&quot; therefore cannot contain any refined oil.
* &quot;Crude olive pomace oil&quot; is the oil obtained by treating olive pomace (the leftover paste after the pressing of olives for virgin olive oils) with solvents or other physical treatments, to the exclusion of oils obtained by re-esterification processes and of any mixture with oils of other kinds. It is then further refined into &quot;refined olive pomace oil&quot; and once re-blended with virgin olive oils for taste, is then known as &quot;olive pomace oil&quot;.

====International Olive Council====
In countries that adhere to the standards of the International Olive Council, as well as in Australia, and under the voluntary United States Department of Agriculture labeling standards in the United States:

Extra virgin olive oil is the highest grade of virgin olive oil derived by cold mechanical extraction without use of solvents or refining methods. It contains no more than 0.8% free acidity, and is judged to have a superior taste, having some fruitiness and no defined sensory defects. Extra virgin olive oil accounts for less than 10% of oil in many producing countries; the percentage is far higher in some Mediterranean countries.

The International Olive Council requires the median of the fruity attribute to be higher than zero for a given olive oil in order to meet the criteria of extra virgin olive oil classification.

Virgin olive oil is a lesser grade of virgin oil, with free acidity of up to 2.0%, and is judged to have a good taste, but may include some sensory defects.

Refined olive oil is virgin oil that has been refined using charcoal and other chemical and physical filters, methods which do not alter the glyceridic structure. It has a free acidity, expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 0.3 grams per 100 grams (0.3%) and its other characteristics correspond to those fixed for this category in this standard. It is obtained by refining virgin oils to eliminate high acidity or organoleptic defects. Oils labeled as &quot;pure olive oil&quot; or &quot;olive oil&quot; are primarily refined olive oil, with a small addition of virgin for taste.

Olive pomace oil is refined pomace olive oil, often blended with some virgin oil. It is fit for consumption, but may not be described simply as &quot;olive oil&quot;. It has a more neutral flavor than pure or virgin olive oil, making it less desirable to users concerned with flavor; however, it has the same fat composition as regular olive oil, giving it the same health benefits. It also has a high smoke point, and consequently is widely used in restaurants as well as home cooking in some countries.

==== United States ====
The United States is not a member of the IOC and does not implement its grades, but on October 25, 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) established Standards for Grades of Olive Oil and Olive-Pomace Oil which closely parallel the IOC standards:
* U.S. extra virgin olive oil for oil with excellent flavor and odor and free fatty acid content of not more than 0.8 g per 100 g (0.8%);
* U.S. virgin olive oil for oil with reasonably good flavor and odor and free fatty acid content of not more than 2 g per 100 g (2%);
* U.S. virgin olive oil Not Fit For Human Consumption Without Further Processing is a virgin (mechanically-extracted) olive oil of poor flavor and odor, equivalent to the IOC&#x27;s oil;
* U.S. olive oil is a mixture of virgin and refined oils;
* U.S. refined olive oil is an oil made from refined oils with some restrictions on the processing.

These grades are voluntary. Certification is available, for a fee, from the USDA.

In 2014, California adopted a set of olive oil standards for olive oil made from California-grown olives. The California Department of Food and Agriculture Grade and Labeling Standards for Olive Oil, Refined-Olive Oil and Olive-Pomace Oil are mandatory for producers of more than 5,000 gallons of California olive oil. This joins other official state, federal and international olive oil standards.

Several olive producer associations, such as the North American Olive Oil Association and the California Olive Oil Council, also offer grading and certification within the United States. Oleologist Nicholas Coleman suggests that the California Olive Oil Council certification is the most stringent of the voluntary grading schemes in the United States.

Country of origin can be established by one or two letter country codes printed on the bottle or label. Country codes include I=Italy, GR=Greece, E=Spain, TU=Tunisia, MA=Morocco, CL=Chile, AG=Argentina, AU=Australia.

=== Label wording ===
* Different names for olive oil indicate the degree of processing the oil has undergone as well as the quality of the oil. Extra virgin olive oil is the highest grade available, followed by virgin olive oil. The word &quot;virgin&quot; indicates that the olives have been pressed to extract the oil; no heat or chemicals have been used during the extraction process, and the oil is pure and unrefined. Virgin olive oils contain the highest levels of polyphenols, antioxidants that have been linked with better health.
* &quot;Olive Oil&quot;, which is sometimes denoted as being &quot;Made from refined and virgin olive oils&quot; is a blend of refined olive oil with a virgin grade of olive oil. &quot;Pure&quot;, &quot;Classic&quot;, &quot;Light&quot; and &quot;Extra-Light&quot; are terms introduced by manufacturers in countries that are non-traditional consumers of olive oil for these products to indicate both their composition of being only 100% olive oil, and also the varying strength of taste to consumers. Contrary to a common consumer belief, they do not have fewer calories than extra virgin oil as implied by the names.
* &quot;Cold pressed&quot; or &quot;Cold extraction&quot; means &quot;that the oil was not heated over a certain temperature (usually ) during processing, thus retaining more nutrients and undergoing less degradation&quot;. The difference between &quot;Cold Extraction&quot; and &quot;Cold Pressed&quot; is regulated in Europe, where the use of a centrifuge, the modern method of extraction for large quantities, must be labelled as &quot;Cold Extracted&quot;, while only a physically pressed olive oil may be labelled as &quot;Cold Pressed&quot;. In many parts of the world, such as Australia, producers using centrifugal extraction still label their products as &quot;Cold Pressed&quot;.
* &quot;First cold pressed&quot; means &quot;that the fruit of the olive was crushed exactly one time – i.e., the &quot;first press.&quot; The &quot;cold&quot; refers to the temperature range of the fruit at the time it is crushed&quot;. In Calabria (Italy) the olives are collected in October. In regions like Tuscany or Liguria, the olives collected in November and ground, often at night, are too cold to be processed efficiently without heating. The paste is regularly heated above the environmental temperatures, which may be as low as 10–15 °C, to extract the oil efficiently with only physical means. Olives pressed in warm regions like Southern Italy or Northern Africa may be pressed at significantly higher temperatures although not heated. While it is important that the pressing temperatures be as low as possible (generally below 25 °C) there is no international reliable definition of &quot;cold pressed&quot;.Furthermore, there is no &quot;second&quot; press of virgin oil, so the term &quot;first press&quot; means only that the oil was produced in a press vs. other possible methods.
* &quot;Protected designation of origin&quot; (PDO) and &quot;protected geographical indication&quot; (PGI) refer to olive oils with &quot;exceptional properties and quality derived from their place of origin as well as from the way of their production&quot;.
* The label may indicate that the oil was bottled or packed in a stated country. This does not necessarily mean that the oil was produced there. The origin of the oil may sometimes be marked elsewhere on the label; it may be a mixture of oils from more than one country.
* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration permitted a claim on olive oil labels stating: &quot;Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about two tablespoons (23 g) of olive oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.&quot;

=== Adulteration ===
There have been allegations, particularly in Italy and Spain, that regulation can be sometimes lax and corrupt. Major shippers are claimed to routinely adulterate olive oil so that only about 40% of olive oil sold as &quot;extra virgin&quot; in Italy actually meets the specification. In some cases, colza oil (extracted from rapeseed) with added color and flavor has been labeled and sold as olive oil. This extensive fraud prompted the Italian government to mandate a new labeling law in 2007 for companies selling olive oil, under which every bottle of Italian olive oil would have to declare the farm and press on which it was produced, as well as display a precise breakdown of the oils used, for blended oils. In February 2008, however, EU officials took issue with the new law, stating that under EU rules such labeling should be voluntary rather than compulsory. Under EU rules, olive oil may be sold as Italian even if it only contains a small amount of Italian oil.

Extra virgin olive oil has strict requirements and is checked for &quot;sensory defects&quot; that include: rancid, fusty, musty, winey (vinegary) and muddy sediment. These defects can occur for different reasons. The most common are:
* Raw material (olives) infected or battered
* Inadequate harvest, with contact between the olives and soil

In March 2008, 400 Italian police officers conducted Operation Golden Oil, arresting 23 people and confiscating 85 farms after an investigation revealed a large-scale scheme to relabel oils from other Mediterranean nations as Italian. In April 2008, another operation impounded seven olive oil plants and arrested 40 people in nine provinces of northern and southern Italy for adding chlorophyll to sunflower and soybean oil and selling it as extra virgin olive oil, both in Italy and abroad; 25,000 liters of the fake oil were seized and prevented from being exported.

On March 15, 2011, the prosecutor&#x27;s office in Florence, Italy, working in conjunction with the forestry department, indicted two managers and an officer of Carapelli, one of the brands of the Spanish company Grupo SOS (which recently changed its name to Deoleo). The charges involved falsified documents and food fraud. Carapelli lawyer Neri Pinucci said the company was not worried about the charges and that &quot;the case is based on an irregularity in the documents.&quot;

In February 2012, Spanish authorities investigated an international olive oil fraud in which palm, avocado, sunflower and other cheaper oils were passed off as Italian olive oil. Police said the oils were blended in an industrial biodiesel plant and adulterated in a way to hide markers that would have revealed their true nature. The oils were not toxic and posed no health risk, according to a statement by the Guardia Civil. Nineteen people were arrested following the year-long joint probe by the police and Spanish tax authorities, as part of Operation Lucerna.

Using tiny print to state the origin of blended oil is used as a legal loophole by manufacturers of adulterated and mixed olive oil.

Journalist Tom Mueller has investigated crime and adulteration in the olive oil business, publishing the article &quot;Slippery Business&quot; in &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine, followed by the 2011 book &quot;Extra Virginity&quot;. On 3 January 2016 Bill Whitaker presented a program on CBS News including interviews with Mueller and with Italian authorities. It was reported that in the previous month 5,000 tons of adulterated olive oil had been sold in Italy, and that organised crime was heavily involved—the term &quot;Agrimafia&quot; was used. The point was made by Mueller that the profit margin on adulterated olive oil was three times that on the illegal narcotic drug cocaine. He said that over 50% of olive oil sold in Italy was adulterated, as was 75–80% of that sold in the US. Whitaker reported that three samples of &quot;extra virgin olive oil&quot; had been bought in a US supermarket and tested; two of the three samples did not meet the required standard, and one of them—from a top-selling US brand—was exceptionally poor.

In early February 2017, the Carabinieri police arrested 33 suspects in the Calabrian mafia&#x27;s Piromalli &#x27;ndrina (&#x27;Ndrangheta) which was allegedly exporting fake extra virgin olive oil to the U.S.; the product was actually inexpensive olive pomace oil fraudulently labeled. Less than a year earlier, the American television program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; had warned that &quot;the olive oil business has been corrupted by the Mafia&quot; and that &quot;Agromafia&quot; was a 16 billion dollar per year enterprise. A Carabinieri investigator interviewed on the program said that &quot;olive oil fraud has gone on for the better part of four millennia&quot; but today, it&#x27;s particularly &quot;easy for the bad guys to either introduce adulterated olive oils or mix in lower quality olive oils with extra-virgin olive oil&quot;. Weeks later, a report by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine stated that &quot;it&#x27;s reliably reported that 80% of the Italian olive oil on the [US] market is fraudulent&quot; and that &quot;a massive olive oil scandal is being uncovered in Southern Italy (Puglia, Umbria and Campania)&quot;.

== Quality control and fraud ==
In July 2024, the European Union reported a significant increase in olive oil fraud and mislabeling cases. The European Commission&#x27;s annual report on food fraud revealed that olive oil remained one of the most frequently adulterated food products, with incidents reaching a record high.

== Mislabeling and adulteration ==
The most common forms of olive oil fraud included:

# Mislabeling lower-grade oils as extra virgin olive oil
# Diluting olive oil with cheaper vegetable oils
# Falsely claiming EU origin for non-EU oils

These fraudulent practices not only deceive consumers but also undermine the reputation of legitimate producers, particularly those from traditional olive-growing regions in the Mediterranean.

== EU response ==
To combat the rising fraud cases, the European Union has implemented several measures:

* Increased inspections and testing of olive oil shipments
* Enhanced traceability requirements for producers and distributors
* Stricter penalties for companies found guilty of fraud
* Improved cooperation between member states&#x27; food safety authorities

The EU has also launched a public awareness campaign to educate consumers about olive oil quality and how to identify authentic products.

== Impact on the industry ==
The surge in fraud cases has led to:

* Higher production costs for honest producers due to increased compliance requirements
* Potential market share loss for authentic extra virgin olive oil as cheaper, adulterated products flood the market
* Growing consumer skepticism about olive oil quality claims

Industry experts stress the importance of supporting reputable producers and urge consumers to be more vigilant when purchasing olive oil, particularly when prices seem unusually low for claimed quality.

== Constituents ==
Olive oil is composed mainly of the mixed triglyceride esters of oleic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid and of other fatty acids, along with traces of squalene (up to 0.7%) and sterols (about 0.2% phytosterol and tocosterols). The composition varies by cultivar, region, altitude, time of harvest, and extraction process.

===Comparison to other vegetable oils===
=== Phenolic composition ===
Olive oil contains traces of phenolics (about 0.5%), such as esters of tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, oleocanthal and oleuropein, which give extra virgin olive oil its bitter, pungent taste, and are also implicated in its aroma. Olive oil is a source of at least 30 phenolic compounds, among which are elenolic acid, a marker for maturation of olives, and alpha-tocopherol, one of the eight members of the Vitamin E family. Oleuropein, together with other closely related compounds such as 10-hydroxyoleuropein, ligstroside and 10-hydroxyligstroside, are tyrosol esters of elenolic acid.

Other phenolic constituents include flavonoids, lignans and pinoresinol.

== Nutrition ==

Olive oil is 100% fat, containing no carbohydrates, dietary fiber, protein or water (table).

In a reference amount of , olive oil supplies 884 calories of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin E (96% DV) and vitamin K (57% DV) (table). 

One tablespoon (13.5 g) of olive oil supplies of food energy and contains 13.5 g of fat, including 9.9 g of monounsaturated fat (mainly as oleic acid), 1.4 g of polyunsaturated fat (mainly as linoleic acid), and 1.9 g of saturated fat (mainly as palmitic acid).

== Potential health effects ==
In the United States, the FDA allows producers of olive oil to place the following qualified health claim on product labels:

In a review by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2011, health claims on olive oil were approved for protection by its polyphenols against oxidation of blood lipids, and for maintenance of normal blood LDL-cholesterol levels by replacing saturated fats in the diet with oleic acid. (See also: Commission Regulation (EU) 432/2012 of 16 May 2012). Despite its approval, the EFSA has noted that a definitive cause-and-effect relationship has not been adequately established for consumption of olive oil and maintaining normal (fasting) blood concentrations of triglycerides, normal blood HDL-cholesterol concentrations, and normal blood glucose concentrations.

A 2014 meta-analysis concluded that increased consumption of olive oil was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events and stroke, while monounsaturated fatty acids of mixed animal and plant origin showed no significant effects. Another meta-analysis in 2018 found high-polyphenol olive oil intake was associated with improved measures of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, malondialdehyde, and oxidized LDL when compared to low-polyphenol olive oils, although it recommended longer studies, and more investigation of non-Mediterranean populations.

<text>The olive, botanical name Olea europaea, meaning &#x27;European olive&#x27;, is a species of small tree or shrub in the family Oleaceae, found traditionally in the Mediterranean Basin, with wild subspecies found further afield in Africa and western Asia. When in shrub form, it is known as &quot;Olea europaea&quot; ″Montra″, dwarf olive, or little olive. The species is cultivated in all the countries of the Mediterranean, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, North and South America and South Africa. It is the type species for its genus, &quot;Olea&quot;. The tree and its fruit give their name to the Oleaceae plant family, which also includes species such as lilac, jasmine, forsythia, and the true ash tree.

The olive&#x27;s fruit, also called an &quot;olive&quot;, is of major agricultural importance in the Mediterranean region as the source of olive oil; it is one of the core ingredients in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. Thousands of cultivars of the olive tree are known. Olive cultivars may be used primarily for oil, eating, or both. Olives cultivated for consumption are generally referred to as &quot;table olives&quot;. About 80% of all harvested olives are turned into oil, while about 20% are used as table olives. 

==Etymology==
The word &quot;olive&quot; derives from Latin &#x27; &#x27;olive fruit; olive tree&#x27;, possibly through Etruscan 𐌀𐌅𐌉𐌄𐌋𐌄 (&quot;eleiva&quot;) from the archaic Proto-Greek form *ἐλαίϝα (*&quot;elaíwa&quot;) (Classic Greek &#x27; &#x27;olive fruit; olive tree&#x27;. The word &quot;oil&quot; originally meant &#x27;olive oil&#x27;, from &#x27;, (&#x27; &#x27;olive oil&#x27;). The word for &#x27;oil&#x27; in multiple other languages also ultimately derives from the name of this tree and its fruit. The oldest attested forms of the Greek words are Mycenaean , &#x27;, and , &#x27; or , &quot;&quot;, written in the Linear B syllabic script.

==Description==
The olive tree, &quot;Olea europaea&quot;, is an evergreen tree or shrub native to Mediterranean Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is short and squat and rarely exceeds in height. &#x27;Pisciottana&#x27;, a unique variety comprising 40,000 trees found only in the area around Pisciotta in the Campania region of southern Italy, often exceeds this, with correspondingly large trunk diameters. The silvery green leaves are oblong, measuring long and wide. The trunk is typically gnarled and twisted.

The small, white, feathery flowers, with ten-cleft calyx and corolla, two stamens, and bifid stigma, are borne generally on the previous year&#x27;s wood, in racemes springing from the axils of the leaves.

The fruit is a small drupe, long when ripe, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives are harvested in the green to purple stage. &quot;O. europaea&quot; contains a pyrena commonly referred to in American English as a &quot;pit&quot;, and in British English as a &quot;stone&quot;.
==Taxonomy==
The six natural subspecies of &quot;Olea europaea&quot; are distributed over a wide range:

*&quot;O. e.&quot; subsp. &quot;europaea&quot; (Mediterranean Basin)

The subspecies &quot;europaea&quot; is divided into two varieties, the &quot;europaea&quot;, which was formerly named &quot;Olea sativa&quot;, with the seedlings called &quot;olivasters&quot;, and &quot;silvestris&quot;, which corresponds to the old wildly growing Mediterranean species &quot;O. oleaster&quot;, with the seedlings called &quot;oleasters&quot;. The &quot;sylvestris&quot; is characterized by a smaller, shrubby tree that produces smaller fruits and leaves.

*&quot;O. e.&quot; subsp. &quot;cuspidata&quot; (from South Africa throughout East Africa, Arabia to Southwest China)
*&quot;O. e.&quot; subsp. &quot;cerasiformis&quot; (Madeira); also known as &quot;Olea maderensis&quot;
*&quot;O. e.&quot; subsp. &quot;guanchica&quot; (Canary Islands)
*&quot;O. e.&quot; subsp. &quot;laperrinei&quot; (Algeria, Sudan, Niger)
*&quot;O. e.&quot; subsp. &quot;maroccana&quot; (Morocco)

The subspecies &quot;O. e. cerasiformis&quot; is tetraploid, and &quot;O. e. maroccana&quot; is hexaploid. Wild-growing forms of the olive are sometimes treated as the species &quot;Olea oleaster&quot;, or &quot;oleaster.&quot; The trees referred to as &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; olives in Southeast Asia are not actually olives but species of &quot;Canarium&quot;.

===Cultivars===

Hundreds of cultivars of the olive tree are known. An olive&#x27;s cultivar has a significant impact on its colour, size, shape, and growth characteristics, as well as the qualities of olive oil. Olive cultivars may be used primarily for oil, eating, or both. Olives cultivated for consumption are generally referred to as &quot;table olives&quot;.

Since many olive cultivars are self-sterile or nearly so, they are generally planted in pairs with a single primary cultivar and a secondary cultivar selected for its ability to fertilize the primary one. In recent times, efforts have been directed at producing hybrid cultivars with qualities useful to farmers, such as resistance to disease, quick growth, and larger or more consistent crops.

==History==

===Mediterranean Basin===
Fossil evidence indicates that the olive tree had its origins 20–40 million years ago in the Oligocene, in what now corresponds to Italy and the eastern Mediterranean Basin. Around 100,000 years ago, olives were used by humans in Africa, on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, for fuel and most probably for consumption. Wild olive trees, or oleasters, have been collected in the Eastern Mediterranean since ~19,000 BP. The genome of cultivated olives reflects their origin from oleaster populations in the Eastern Mediterranean. The olive plant was first cultivated some 7,000 years ago in Mediterranean regions.

For thousands of years olives were grown primarily for lamp oil, with little regard for culinary flavor. Its origin can be traced to the Levant based on written tablets, olive pits, and wood fragments found in ancient tombs. As far back as 3000BC, olives were grown commercially in Crete and may have been the source of the wealth of the Minoan civilization.

The ancestry of the cultivated olive is unknown. Fossil &quot;olea&quot; pollen has been found in Macedonia and other places around the Mediterranean, indicating that this genus is an original element of the Mediterranean flora. Fossilized leaves of &quot;olea&quot; were found in the palaeosols of the volcanic Greek island of Santorini and dated to about 37,000 BP. Imprints of larvae of olive whitefly &quot;Aleurobus olivinus&quot; were found on the leaves. The same insect is commonly found today on olive leaves, showing that the plant-animal co-evolutionary relations have not changed since that time. Other leaves found on the same island are dated back to 60,000 BP, making them the oldest known olives from the Mediterranean.

===Outside the Mediterranean===

Olives are not native to the Americas. Spanish colonists brought the olive to the New World, where its cultivation prospered in present-day Peru, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina. The first seedlings from Spain were planted in Lima by Antonio de Rivera in 1560. Olive tree cultivation quickly spread along the valleys of South America&#x27;s dry Pacific coast where the climate was similar to the Mediterranean. Spanish missionaries established the tree in the 18th century in California. It was first cultivated at Mission San Diego de Alcalá in 1769 or later around 1795. Orchards were started at other missions, but in 1838, an inspection found only two olive orchards in California. Cultivation for oil gradually became a highly successful commercial venture from the 1860s onward.

In Japan, the first successful planting of olive trees happened in 1908 on Shodo Island, which became the cradle of olive cultivation in Japan.

In 2016, olive oil production started in India, with olive saplings planted in Rajasthan&#x27;s Thar Desert.

Favoured by climate warming, several small-scale olive production farms have also been established at fairly high latitudes in Europe and North America since the early 21st century.

There were an estimated 865 million olive trees in the world as of 2005, and the vast majority of these were found in Mediterranean countries, with traditionally marginal areas accounting for no more than 25% of olive-planted area and 10% of oil production.

==Symbolic connotations==
===Ancient Greece===

Olives are thought to have been domesticated in the third millennium BC at the latest, at which point they, along with grain and grapes, became part of Colin Renfrew&#x27;s Mediterranean triad of staple crops that fueled the emergence of more complex societies. Olives, and especially (perfumed) olive oil, became a major export product during the Minoan and Mycenaean periods. Dutch archaeologist Jorrit Kelder proposed that the Mycenaeans sent shipments of olive oil, probably alongside live olive branches, to the court of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten as a diplomatic gift. In Egypt, these imported olive branches may have acquired ritual meanings, as they are depicted as offerings on the wall of the Aten temple and were used in wreaths for the burial of Tutankhamun. It is likely that, as well as being used for culinary purposes, olive oil was also used to various other ends, including as a perfume. 

The ancient Greeks smeared olive oil on their bodies and hair as a matter of grooming and good health. Olive oil was used to anoint kings and athletes in ancient Greece. It was burnt in the sacred lamps of temples and was the &quot;eternal flame&quot; of the original Olympic games. Victors in these games were crowned with its leaves. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus crawls beneath two shoots of olive that grow from a single stock, and in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, (XVII.53ff) there is a metaphoric description of a lone olive tree in the mountains, by a spring; the Greeks observed that the olive rarely thrives at a distance from the sea, which in Greece invariably means up mountain slopes. Greek myth attributed to the primordial culture-hero Aristaeus the understanding of olive husbandry, along with cheese-making and bee-keeping. Olive was one of the woods used to fashion the most primitive Greek cult figures, called &quot;xoana&quot;, referring to their wooden material; they were reverently preserved for centuries.

In an archaic Athenian foundation myth, Athena won the patronage of Attica from Poseidon with the gift of the olive. According to the fourth-century BC father of botany, Theophrastus, olive trees ordinarily attained an age around 200 years, he mentions that the very olive tree of Athena still grew on the Acropolis; it was still to be seen there in the second century AD; and when Pausanias was shown it , he reported &quot;Legend also says that when the Persians fired Athens the olive was burnt down, but on the very day it was burnt it grew again to the height of two cubits.&quot; Indeed, olive suckers sprout readily from the stump, and the great age of some existing olive trees shows that it was possible that the olive tree of the Acropolis dated to the Bronze Age. The olive was sacred to Athena and appeared on the Athenian coinage. According to another myth, Elaea was an accomplished athlete killed by her fellow athletes who had grown envious of her; but Athena and Gaia turned her into an olive tree as reward.

Theophrastus, in &quot;On the Causes of Plants&quot;, states that the cultivated olive must be vegetatively propagated; indeed, the pits give rise to thorny, wild-type olives, spread far and wide by birds. Theophrastus reports how the bearing olive can be grafted on the wild olive, for which the Greeks had a separate name, &quot;kotinos&quot;. In his &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot;, he states that the olive can be propagated from a piece of the trunk, the root, a twig, or a stake.

===Ancient Rome===
According to Pliny the Elder a vine, a fig tree and an olive tree grew in the middle of the Roman Forum; the olive was planted to provide shade. (The garden was recreated in the 20th century). The Roman poet Horace mentions it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: &quot;As for me, olives, endives, and smooth mallows provide sustenance.&quot; Lord Monboddo comments on the olive in 1779 as one of the foods preferred by the ancients and as one of the most perfect foods.

Vitruvius describes of the use of charred olive wood in tying together walls and foundations in his &quot;&quot;.

===Judaism and Israel===

Olives were one of the main elements in ancient Israelite cuisine. Olive oil was used for not only food and cooking, but also lighting, sacrificial offerings, ointment, and anointment for priestly or royal office. The olive tree is one of the first plants mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, and one of the most significant. An olive branch (or leaf, depending on translation) was brought back to Noah by a dove to demonstrate that the flood was over (Genesis 8:11).

The olive is listed in Deuteronomy 8:8 as one of the seven species that are noteworthy products of the Land of Israel. According to the Halakha, the Jewish law mandatory for all Jews, the olive is one of the seven species that require the recitation of &quot;me&#x27;eyn shalosh&quot; after they are consumed. Olive oil is also the most recommended and best possible oil for the lighting of the Shabbat candles.

Due to its importance in the Hebrew Bible, the olive has significant national meaning in modern Israeli culture. Two olive branches appear as part of Israel&#x27;s emblem and the olive tree is Israel&#x27;s national tree.

===Christianity===
Apart from being mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (the Christian Old Testament), olives play an important role in Christianity. 
The Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, is mentioned several times in the New Testament. The Allegory of the Olive Tree in St Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans refers to the scattering and gathering of Israel. It compares the Israelites to a tame olive tree and the Gentiles to a wild olive branch. The olive tree itself, as well as olive oil and olives, play an important role in the Bible.

===Islam===
The olive tree and olive oil are mentioned seven times in the Quran, and the olive is praised as a precious fruit. Olive tree and olive oil health benefits have been propounded in prophetic medicine. Muhammad is reported to have said: &quot;Take oil of olive and massage with it – it is a blessed tree&quot; (Sunan al-Darimi, 69:103). Olives are substitutes for dates (if not available) during Ramadan fasting, and olive tree leaves are used as incense in some Muslim Mediterranean countries.

=== Palestine ===

In Palestine the olive tree and plant carry the symbolic connotations of resilience, health, ancestral ties and community. Researchers have found that the olive tree is tied into the Palestinians&#x27; Sutra, A’wana and Sumud. The tree is a means of survival and security, represents their bond to their land, community and animals. Olive trees also serve as a symbol of their identities, which include their physical and emotional aspects and their socio-cultural values. Palestinian people view the olive trees as the first witnesses that Palestine is their homeland. 

The harvest season is referred to as &quot;Palestine&#x27;s wedding&quot; and is considered a national holiday when schools close for two days so that pupils and teachers can join in the harvest. This holiday allows community and family members to gather and serves as a ritual that encompasses their values surrounding family, labour, community and aid for other members of the community that do not possess land. This is practised through the tradition of leaving fruit on a tree during the harvest so that those who do not have land and are unable to take part in the harvest can still reap the benefits.

=== United States ===
The Great Seal of the United States first used in 1782 depicts an eagle clutching an olive branch in one of its talons, indicating the power of peace.

===United Nations===
The Flag of the United Nations adopted in 1946 is a world map with two olive branches.

==Oldest known trees==
* An olive tree in Mouriscas, Abrantes, Portugal, (&quot;Oliveira do Mouchão&quot;) is one of the oldest known olive trees still alive to this day, with an estimated age of 3,350 years, planted approximately at the beginning of the Atlantic Bronze Age. 
* An olive tree in the city of Bar in Montenegro has an estimated age of between 2,014 and 2,480 years.
* An olive tree on the island of Brijuni in Croatia has a radiocarbon dating age of about 1,600 years. It still gives fruit (about per year), which is made into olive oil.
* An olive tree in west Athens, named Plato&#x27;s Olive Tree, is thought to be a remnant of the grove where Plato&#x27;s Academy was situated, making it an estimated 2,400 years old. The tree consisted of a cavernous trunk from which a few branches were still sprouting in 1975 when a traffic accident caused a bus to uproot it. Following that the trunk was preserved and displayed in the nearby Agricultural University of Athens.
* The age of an olive tree in Crete, the Finix Olive, is claimed to be more than 2,000 years, based on archaeological evidence around the tree. 
* The olive tree of Vouves in Crete has an age estimated at between 2,000 and 4,000 years. 
* An olive tree called Farga d&#x27;Arió in Ulldecona, Catalonia, Spain, has been estimated (with laser-perimetry methods) to date back to 314 AD, which would mean that it was planted when Constantine the Great was Roman emperor.
* Some Italian olive trees are believed to date back to Ancient Rome (8th century BC to 5th century AD), although identifying progenitor trees in ancient sources is difficult. There are other trees about 1,000 years old in the same garden. The 15th-century trees of Olivo della Linza, at Alliste in the Province of Lecce in Apulia on the Italian mainland, were noted by Bishop Ludovico de Pennis during his pastoral visit to the Diocese of Nardò-Gallipoli in 1452.
* The village of Bcheale, Lebanon, claims to have the oldest olive trees in the world (4000 BC for the oldest), but no scientific study supports these claims. Other trees in the towns of Amioun appear to be at least 1,500 years old.
* Several trees in the Garden of Gethsemane (from the Hebrew words &quot;gat shemanim&quot; or olive press) in Jerusalem are claimed to date back to the time of Jesus. A study conducted by the National Research Council of Italy in 2012 used carbon dating on older parts of the trunks of three trees from Gethsemane and came up with the dates of 1092, 1166 and 1198 AD, while DNA tests show that the trees were originally planted from the same parent plant. According to molecular analysis, the tested trees showed the same allelic profile at all microsatellite loci analyzed, which furthermore may indicate attempt to keep the lineage of an older species intact. However, Bernabei writes, &quot;All the tree trunks are hollow inside so that the central, older wood is missing... In the end, only three from a total of eight olive trees could be successfully dated. The dated ancient olive trees do not, however, allow any hypothesis to be made with regard to the age of the remaining five giant olive trees.&quot; Babcox concludes, &quot;The roots of the eight oldest trees are possibly much older. Visiting guides to the garden often state that they are two thousand years old.&quot;
* The 2,000-year-old Bidni olive trees on Malta, which have been confirmed through carbon dating, have been protected since 1933 and are listed in UNESCO&#x27;s Database of National Cultural Heritage Laws. In 2011, after recognising their historical and landscape value, and in recognition of the fact that &quot;only 20 trees remain from 40 at the beginning of the 20th century&quot;, Maltese authorities declared the ancient Bidni olive grove at Bidnija as a Tree Protected Area.
==Uses==
The olive tree, &quot;Olea europaea&quot;, has been cultivated for olive oil, fine wood, olive leaf, ornamental reasons, and the olive fruit. About 80% of all harvested olives are turned into oil, while about 20% are used as table olives. The olive is one of the &quot;trinity&quot; or &quot;triad&quot; of basic ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat for bread, pasta, and couscous; and the grape for wine.

=== Olive oil ===
Olive oil is a liquid fat obtained from olives, produced by pressing whole olives and extracting the oil. It is commonly used in cooking, for frying foods or as a salad dressing. It is also used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soaps, and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps, and has additional uses in some religions. Spain accounts for almost half of global olive oil production; other major producers are Portugal, Italy, Tunisia, Greece and Turkey. Per capita consumption is highest in Greece, followed by Italy and Spain.

The composition of olive oil varies with the cultivar, elevation, time of harvest and extraction process. It consists mainly of oleic acid (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of other fatty acids including linoleic acid (up to 21%) and palmitic acid (up to 20%). Extra virgin olive oil is required to have no more than 0.8% free acidity and fruity flavor characteristics.

===Table olives===

Table olives are classified by the International Olive Council (IOC) into three groups according to the degree of ripeness achieved before harvesting:
# Green olives are picked when they have obtained full size, while unripe; they are usually shades of green to yellow and contain the bitter phytochemical oleuropein.
# Semi-ripe or turning-colour olives are picked at the beginning of the ripening cycle, when the colour has begun to change from green to multicolour shades of red to brown. Only the skin is coloured, as the flesh of the fruit lacks pigmentation at this stage, unlike that of ripe olives.
# Black olives or ripe olives are picked at full maturity when fully ripe, displaying colours of purple, brown or black. To leach the oleuropein from olives, commercial producers use lye, which neutralizes the bitterness of oleuropein, producing a mild flavour and soft texture characteristic of California black olives sold in cans. Such olives are typically preserved in brine and sterilized under high heat during the canning process.

==== Fermentation and curing ====
Raw or fresh olives are naturally very bitter; to make them palatable, olives must be cured and fermented, thereby removing oleuropein, a bitter phenolic compound that can reach levels of 14% of dry matter in young olives. In addition to oleuropein, other phenolic compounds render freshly picked olives unpalatable and must also be removed or lowered in quantity through curing and fermentation. Generally speaking, phenolics reach their peak in young fruit and are converted as the fruit matures. Once ripening occurs, the levels of phenolics sharply decline through their conversion to other organic products, which render some cultivars edible immediately. One example of an edible olive native to the island of Thasos is the &quot;throubes&quot; black olive, which becomes edible when allowed to ripen in the sun, shrivel, and fall from the tree.

The curing process may take from a few days with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the exception of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final table olive product. Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. Lactic acid is the most important metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is table olives which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.

The many types of preparations for table olives depend on local tastes and traditions. The most important commercial examples are listed below.

Lebanese or Phoenician fermentation
Applied to green, semiripe, or ripe olives. Olives are soaked in salt water for 24–48 hours. Then they are slightly crushed with a rock to hasten the fermentation process. The olives are stored for a period of up to a year in a container with salt water, lemon juice, lemon peels, laurel and olive leaves, and rosemary. Some recipes may contain white vinegar or olive oil.

Spanish or Sevillian fermentation
Most commonly applied to green olive preparation, around 60% of all the world&#x27;s table olives are produced with this method. Olives are soaked in lye (dilute NaOH, 2–4%) for 8–10 hours to hydrolyse the oleuropein. They are usually considered &quot;treated&quot; when the lye has penetrated two-thirds of the way into the fruit. They are then washed once or several times in water to remove the caustic solution and transferred to fermenting vessels full of brine at typical concentrations of 8–12% NaCl. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. 

Fermentation is carried out by the natural microbiota present on the olives that survive the lye treatment process. Many organisms are involved, usually reflecting the local conditions or &quot;terroir&quot; of the olives. During a typical fermentation gram-negative enterobacteria flourish in small numbers at first but are rapidly outgrown by lactic acid bacteria species such as &quot;Leuconostoc mesenteroides&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus brevis&quot; and &quot;Pediococcus damnosus&quot;. These bacteria produce lactic acid to help lower the pH of the brine and therefore stabilize the product against unwanted pathogenic species. A diversity of yeasts then accumulate in sufficient numbers to help complete the fermentation alongside the lactic acid bacteria. Yeasts commonly mentioned include the teleomorphs &quot;Pichia anomala&quot;, &quot;Pichia membranifaciens&quot;, &quot;Debaryomyces hansenii&quot; and &quot;Kluyveromyces marxianus&quot;.

Once fermented, the olives are placed in fresh brine and acid corrected, to be ready for market.

Sicilian or Greek fermentation
Applied to green, semiripe and ripe olives, they are almost identical to the Spanish type fermentation process, but the lye treatment process is skipped and the olives are placed directly in fermentation vessels full of brine (8–12% NaCl). The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. As the caustic treatment is avoided, lactic acid bacteria are only present in similar numbers to yeast and appear to be outdone by the abundant yeasts found on untreated olives. As very little acid is produced by the yeast fermentation, lactic, acetic, or citric acid is often added to the fermentation stage to stabilize the process.

Picholine or directly brined fermentation
Applied to green, semi-ripe, or ripe olives, they are soaked in lye typically for longer periods than Spanish style (e.g. 10–72 hours) until the solution has penetrated three-quarters of the way into the fruit. They are then washed and immediately brined and acid corrected with citric acid to achieve microbial stability. Fermentation still occurs carried out by acidogenic yeast and bacteria but is more subdued than other methods. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds, and a series of progressively stronger concentrations of salt are added until the product is fully stabilized and ready to be eaten.

Water-cured fermentation
Applied to green, semi-ripe, or ripe olives, these are soaked in water or weak brine and this solution is changed on a daily basis for 10–14 days. The oleuropein is naturally dissolved and leached into the water and removed during a continual soak-wash cycle. Fermentation takes place during the water treatment stage and involves a mixed yeast/bacteria ecosystem. Sometimes, the olives are lightly cracked with a blunt instrument to trigger fermentation and speed up the fermentation process. Once debittered, the olives are brined to concentrations of 8–12% NaCl and acid corrected and are then ready to eat.

Salt-cured fermentation
Applied only to ripe olives, since it is only a light fermentation. They are usually produced in Morocco, Turkey, and other eastern Mediterranean countries. Once picked, the olives are vigorously washed and packed in alternating layers with salt. The high concentration of salt draws the moisture out of olives, dehydrating and shriveling them until they look somewhat analogous to a raisin. Once packed in salt, fermentation is minimal and only initiated by the most halophilic yeast species such as &quot;Debaryomyces hansenii&quot;. Once cured, they are sold in their natural state without any additives. So-called oil-cured olives are cured in salt, and then soaked in oil.

California or artificial ripening
Applied to green and semi-ripe olives, they are placed in lye and soaked. Upon their removal, they are washed in water injected with compressed air, without fermentation. This process is repeated several times until both oxygen and lye have soaked through to the pit. The repeated, saturated exposure to air oxidises the skin and flesh of the fruit, turning it black in an artificial process that mimics natural ripening. Once fully oxidised or &quot;blackened&quot;, they are brined and acid corrected and are then ready for eating.

===Olive wood===

Olive wood is very hard and tough and is prized for its durability, colour, high combustion temperature, and interesting grain patterns. Because of the commercial importance of the fruit, slow growth, and relatively small size of the tree, olive wood and its products are relatively expensive. Common uses of olive wood include: kitchen utensils, carved wooden bowls, cutting boards, fine furniture, and decorative items. The yellow or light greenish-brown wood is often finely veined with a darker tint; being very hard and close-grained, it is valued by woodworkers.

===Ornamental uses===
In modern landscape design olive trees are frequently used as ornamental features for their distinctively gnarled trunks and evergreen silvery-gray foliage.

==Cultivation==
The earliest evidence for the domestication of olives comes from the Chalcolithic period archaeological site of Teleilat el Ghassul in modern Jordan. Farmers in ancient times believed that olive trees would not grow well if planted more than a certain distance from the sea; Theophrastus gives 300 stadia () as the limit. Modern experience does not always confirm this, and, though showing a preference for the coast, they have long been grown further inland in some areas with suitable climates, particularly in the southwestern Mediterranean (Iberia and northwest Africa) where winters are mild. An article on olive tree cultivation in Spain is brought down in Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam&#x27;s 12th-century agricultural work, &quot;Book on Agriculture&quot;.

Olives are cultivated in many regions of the world with Mediterranean climates, such as South Africa, Chile, Peru, Pakistan, Australia, Oregon, and California, and in areas with temperate climates such as New Zealand. They are also grown in the Córdoba Province, Argentina, which has a temperate climate.

===Growth and propagation===
Olive trees show a marked preference for calcareous soils, flourishing best on limestone slopes and crags, and coastal climate conditions. They grow in any light soil, even on clay if well drained, but in rich soils, they are predisposed to disease and produce poor quality oil. (This was noted by Pliny the Elder.) Olives like hot weather and sunny positions without any shade, while temperatures below may injure even a mature tree. They tolerate drought well because of their sturdy and extensive root systems. Olive trees can remain productive for centuries as long as they are pruned correctly and regularly.

Only a handful of olive varieties can be used to cross-pollinate. &#x27;Pendolino&#x27; olive trees are partially self-fertile, but pollenizers are needed for a large fruit crop. Other compatible olive tree pollinators include &#x27;Leccino&#x27; and &#x27;Maurino&#x27;. &#x27;Pendolino&#x27; olive trees are used extensively as pollinizers in large olive tree groves.

Olives are propagated by various methods. The preferred ways are cuttings and layers; the tree roots easily in favourable soil and throws up suckers from the stump when cut down. However, yields from trees grown from suckers or seeds are poor; they must be budded or grafted onto other specimens to do well. Branches of various thickness cut into lengths around planted deeply in manured ground soon vegetate. Shorter pieces are sometimes laid horizontally in shallow trenches and, when covered with a few centimetres of soil, rapidly throw up sucker-like shoots. In Greece, grafting the cultivated tree on the wild tree is a common practice. In Italy, embryonic buds, which form small swellings on the stems, are carefully excised and planted under the soil surface, where they soon form a vigorous shoot.

The olive is also sometimes grown from seed. To facilitate germination, the oily pericarp is first softened by slight rotting, or soaked in hot water or in an alkaline solution.

In situations where extreme cold has damaged or killed the olive tree, the rootstock can survive and produce new shoots which in turn become new trees. In this way, olive trees can regenerate themselves. In Tuscany in 1985, a very severe frost destroyed many productive and aged olive trees and ruined many farmers&#x27; livelihoods. However, new shoots appeared in the spring and, once the dead wood was removed, became the basis for new fruit-producing trees.

Olives grow very slowly, and over many years, the trunk can attain a considerable diameter. A. P. de Candolle recorded one exceeding in girth. The trees rarely exceed in height and are generally confined to much more limited dimensions by frequent pruning. Olives are very hardy and are resistant to disease and fire. Its root system is robust and capable of regenerating the tree even if the above-ground structure is destroyed. 

The crop from old trees is sometimes enormous, but they seldom bear well two years in succession, and in many cases, a large harvest occurs every sixth or seventh season. Where the olive is carefully cultivated, as in Liguria, Languedoc, and Provence, the trees are regularly pruned. The pruning preserves the flower-bearing shoots of the preceding year, while keeping the tree low enough to allow the easy gathering of the fruit. The spaces between the trees are regularly fertilized.

===Pests, diseases, and weather===
Various pathologies can affect olives. The most serious pest is the olive fruit fly (&quot;Dacus oleae&quot; or &quot;Bactrocera oleae&quot;) which lays its eggs in the olive most commonly just before it becomes ripe in the autumn. The region surrounding the puncture rots, becomes brown, and takes a bitter taste, making the olive unfit for eating or for oil. For controlling the pest, the practice has been to spray with insecticides (organophosphates, e.g. dimethoate). Classic organic methods have been applied such as trapping, applying the bacterium &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;, and spraying with kaolin. Such methods are obligatory for organic olives.

A fungus, &quot;Cycloconium oleaginum&quot;, can infect the trees for several successive seasons, causing great damage to plantations. A species of bacterium, &quot;Pseudomonas savastanoi&quot; pv. &quot;oleae&quot;, induces tumour growth in the shoots. Certain lepidopterous caterpillars feed on the leaves and flowers. &quot;Xylella fastidiosa&quot; bacteria, which can also infect citrus fruit and vines, has attacked olive trees in Apulia, southern Italy, causing olive quick decline syndrome (OQDS). The main vector is &quot;Philaenus spumarius&quot; (meadow spittlebug).

A pest that spreads through olive trees is the black scale bug, a small black scale insect that resembles a small black spot. They attach themselves firmly to olive trees and reduce the quality of the fruit; their main predators are wasps. The curculio beetle eats the edges of leaves, leaving sawtooth damage.

Rabbits eat the bark of olive trees and can do considerable damage, especially to young trees. If the bark is removed around the entire circumference of a tree, it is likely to die. Voles and mice also do damage by eating the roots. At the northern edge of their cultivation zone, for instance in northern Italy, southern France and Switzerland, olive trees suffer occasionally from frost. Gales and long-continued rains during the gathering season also cause damage. In the colder Mediterranean hinterland, olive cultivation is replaced by other fruits, typically the chestnut.

===As an invasive species===
Since its first domestication, &quot;O. europaea&quot; has been spreading back to the wild from planted groves. Its original wild populations in southern Europe have been largely swamped by feral plants.

In some other parts of the world where it has been introduced, most notably South Australia, the olive has become a major weed that displaces native vegetation. In South Australia, its seeds are spread by the introduced red fox and by many bird species, including the European starling and the native emu, into woodlands, where they germinate and eventually form a dense canopy that prevents regeneration of native trees. As the climate of South Australia is very dry and bushfire prone, the oil-rich feral olive tree substantially increases the fire hazard of native sclerophyll woodlands.

===Harvesting===

Olives are harvested in the autumn and winter. More specifically in the Northern Hemisphere, green olives are picked from the end of September to about the middle of November. In the Southern Hemisphere, green olives are picked from the middle of October to the end of November, and black olives are collected worldwide from the middle of November to the end of January or early February. In southern Europe, harvesting is done for several weeks in winter, but the time varies in each country, and with the season and the cultivar.

Most olives today are harvested by shaking the boughs or the whole tree. Using olives found lying on the ground can result in poor quality oil, due to damage. Another method involves standing on a ladder and &quot;milking&quot; the olives into a sack tied around the harvester&#x27;s waist. This method produces high quality oil. A third method uses a device called an oli-net that wraps around the tree trunk and opens to form an umbrella-like catcher from which workers collect the fruit. Another method uses an electric tool with large tongs that spin around quickly, removing fruit from the tree.

Table olive varieties are more difficult to harvest, as workers must take care not to damage the fruit; baskets that hang around the worker&#x27;s neck are used. In some places in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit is not bruised, which leads to a superior finished product. The method also involves sawing off branches, which is healthy for future production.

The amount of oil contained in the fruit differs greatly by cultivar; the pericarp is usually 60–70% oil. Typical yields are of oil per tree per year.

==Global production==
Olives are one of the most extensively cultivated fruit crops in the world. In 2011, about were planted with olive trees, which is more than twice the amount of land devoted to apples, bananas, or mangoes. Only coconut trees and oil palms command more space. Cultivation area tripled from between 1960 and 1998 and reached a peak of in 2008. Olive production in the Mediterranean region has declined since 2019 due to climate, economic and political factors. The 10 most-producing countries, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, are all located in the Mediterranean region and produce 95% of the world&#x27;s olives. In Italy, cultivation of olive trees is widespread in the south, counting for three quarters of its production. Due to the climate, it is less abundant in the north of Italy, although growth has increased, particularly in the more temperate microclimates of Liguria and the hills around Lake Garda. Approximately 170 million plants distributed over 1 million farms.


==Nutrition==
One hundred grams of cured green olives provide 146 calories, are a rich source of vitamin E (25% of the Daily Value, DV), and contain a large amount of sodium (104% DV); other nutrients are insignificant. Green olives are 75% water, 15% fat, 4% carbohydrates and 1% protein (table).

==Phytochemicals==
The polyphenol composition of olive fruits varies during fruit ripening and during processing by fermentation when olives are immersed whole in brine or crushed to produce oil. In raw fruit, total polyphenol contents, as measured by the Folin method, are 117 mg/100 g in black olives and 161 mg/100 g in green olives, compared to 55 and 21 mg/100 g for extra virgin and virgin olive oil, respectively. Olive fruit contains several types of polyphenols, mainly tyrosols, phenolic acids, flavonols and flavones, and for black olives, anthocyanins. The main bitter flavor of olives before curing results from oleuropein and its aglycone which total in content, respectively, 72 and 82 mg/100 g in black olives, and 56 and 59 mg/100 g in green olives.

During the crushing, kneading and extraction of olive fruit to obtain olive oil, oleuropein, demethyloleuropein and ligstroside are hydrolyzed by endogenous beta-glucosidases to form aldehydes, dialdehydes, and aldehydic aglycones. Polyphenol content also varies with olive cultivar and the manner of presentation, with plain olives having higher contents than those that are pitted or stuffed.

==Allergenic potential==
Olive tree pollen is extremely allergenic, with an OPALS allergy scale rating of 10 out of 10. &quot;Olea europaea&quot; is primarily wind-pollinated and its buoyant pollen is a strong trigger for asthma. One popular variety, &quot;Swan Hill&quot;, is widely sold as an &quot;allergy-free&quot; olive tree; however, this variety does bloom and produce allergenic pollen.

<text>Otho ( ; born Marcus Salvius Otho; 28 April 32 – 16 April 69) was Roman emperor, ruling for three months from 15 January to 16 April 69. He was the second emperor of the Year of the Four Emperors.

A member of a noble Etruscan family, Otho was initially a friend and courtier of the young emperor Nero until he was effectively banished to the governorship of the remote province of Lusitania in 58 following his wife Poppaea Sabina&#x27;s affair with Nero. After a period of moderate rule in the province, he allied himself with Galba, the governor of neighbouring Hispania Tarraconensis, during the revolts of 68. He accompanied Galba on his march to Rome, but revolted and murdered Galba at the start of the next year.

Inheriting the problem of the rebellion of Vitellius, commander of the army in Germania Inferior, Otho led a sizeable force which met Vitellius&#x27; army at the Battle of Bedriacum. After initial fighting resulted in 40,000 casualties, and a retreat of his forces, Otho committed suicide rather than fight on, and Vitellius was proclaimed emperor.

==Early life==
Otho was born on 28 April AD 32. His grandfather Marcus had been a senator, and Claudius granted patrician status to Otho&#x27;s father Lucius Salvius Otho. 

Suetonius, in &quot;The Lives of the Caesars&quot;, comments on Otho&#x27;s appearance and personal hygiene.

Juvenal, in a passage in the Satire II ridiculing male homosexuality, specifically mentions Otho as being vain and effeminate, looking at himself in the mirror before going into battle, and &quot;plaster[ing] his face with dough&quot; in order to look good.

Greenhalgh writes that &quot;he was addicted to luxury and pleasure to a degree remarkable even in a Roman&quot;. An aged freedwoman brought him into the company of the emperor Nero. Otho married the emperor&#x27;s mistress Poppaea Sabina; Nero forced Otho to divorce Poppaea so that he himself could marry her. He exiled Otho to the province of Lusitania in 58 or 59 by appointing him to be its governor.

Otho proved to be capable as governor of Lusitania, yet he never forgave Nero for marrying Poppaea. He allied himself with Galba, governor of neighboring Hispania Tarraconensis, in the latter&#x27;s rebellion against Nero in 68. Nero committed suicide later that year, and Galba was proclaimed emperor by the Senate. Otho accompanied the new emperor to Rome in October 68. Before they entered the city, Galba&#x27;s army fought against a legion that Nero had organized.

==Reign, decline and fall==
===Overthrow of Galba===

On 1 January 69, the day Galba took the office of consul alongside Titus Vinius, the fourth and eighteenth legions of Germania Superior refused to swear loyalty to the emperor. They toppled the statues of Galba and demanded that a new emperor be chosen. On the following day, the soldiers of Germania inferior also refused to swear their loyalty and proclaimed the governor of the province, Aulus Vitellius, as emperor. Galba tried to ensure his authority as emperor was recognized by adopting the nobleman Piso Licinianus as his successor, an action that gained resentment from Otho. Galba was killed by the praetorians on 15 January, followed shortly by Vinius and Piso. Their heads were placed on poles and Otho was proclaimed emperor.

Nero&#x27;s statues were again set up, his freedmen and household officers reinstalled, including the young castrated boy Sporus whom Nero had taken in marriage and Otho also would live intimately with. The populace acclaimed him as &quot;Nero Otho&quot;, although Otho did not appear to like the title. 

At the same time, the fears of the more sober and respectable citizens were relieved by Otho&#x27;s liberal professions of his intention to govern equitably, and by his judicious clemency towards Aulus Marius Celsus, a consul-designate and devoted adherent of Galba. He assumed the consulate of the year alongside his brother Titianus, but only until the 1st of March.

===War with Vitellius===

Otho soon realized that it was much easier to overthrow an Emperor than rule as one: according to Suetonius Otho once remarked that &quot;Playing the Long Pipes is hardly my trade&quot; (i.e. undertaking something beyond one&#x27;s ability to do so). Any further development of Otho&#x27;s policy was checked once he had read through Galba&#x27;s private correspondence and realized the extent of the revolution in Germania, where several legions had declared for Vitellius, the commander of the legions on the lower Rhine River, and were already advancing upon Italy. After a vain attempt to conciliate Vitellius by the offer of a share in the Empire, Otho, with unexpected vigor, prepared for war. From the much more remote provinces, which had quietly accepted his accession, little help was to be expected, but the legions of Dalmatia, Pannonia and Moesia were eager in his cause, the Praetorian cohorts were a formidable force and an efficient fleet gave him the mastery of the Italian seas.

The fleet was at once dispatched to secure Liguria, and on 14 March Otho, undismayed by omens and prophecies, started northwards at the head of his troops in the hopes of preventing the entry of Vitellius&#x27; troops into Italy. But for this he was too late, and all that could be done was to throw troops into Placentia and hold the line of the Po. Otho&#x27;s advanced guard successfully defended Placentia against Aulus Caecina Alienus, and compelled that general to fall back on Cremona, but the arrival of Fabius Valens altered the aspect of affairs.

Vitellius&#x27; commanders now resolved to bring on a decisive battle, the Battle of Bedriacum, and their designs were assisted by the divided and irresolute counsels which prevailed in Otho&#x27;s camp. The more experienced officers urged the importance of avoiding a battle until at least the legions from Dalmatia had arrived. However, the rashness of the emperor&#x27;s brother Titianus and of Proculus, prefect of the Praetorian Guards, added to Otho&#x27;s feverish impatience, overruled all opposition, and an immediate advance was decided upon.

Otho remained behind with a considerable reserve force at Brixellum on the southern bank of the Po. When this decision was taken, Otho&#x27;s army had already crossed the Po and were encamped at Bedriacum (or Betriacum), a small village on the &quot;Via Postumia&quot;, on the route by which the legions from Dalmatia would naturally arrive.

Leaving a strong detachment to hold the camp at Bedriacum, the Othonian forces advanced along the &quot;Via Postumia&quot; in the direction of Cremona. At a short distance from Cremona they unexpectedly encountered the Vitellian troops. The Othonians, though at a disadvantage, fought desperately, but were eventually forced to fall back in disorder upon their camp at Bedriacum. There on the next day the victorious Vitellians followed them, but only to come to terms at once with their disheartened enemy, and to be welcomed into the camp as friends.

===Death===

Otho was still in command of a formidable force as the Dalmatian legions had reached Aquileia and the spirit of his soldiers and their officers was unbroken. He was resolved to accept the verdict of the battle that his own impatience had hastened. In a speech, he bade farewell to those about him, declaring: &quot;It is far more just to perish one for all, than many for one&quot;, and then retiring to rest soundly for some hours. Early in the morning he stabbed himself in the heart with a dagger, which he had concealed under his pillow, and died as his attendants entered the tent.

Otho&#x27;s ashes were placed within a modest monument. He had reigned three months. His funeral was celebrated at once as he had wished. A plain tomb was erected in his honour at Brixellum, with the inscription &quot;Diis Manibus Marci Othonis&quot;. His 91-day reign would be the shortest until that of Pertinax, whose reign lasted 87 days in 193 during the Year of the Five Emperors.
It has been thought that Otho&#x27;s suicide was committed in order to steer his country away from the path to civil war and to avoid casualties in his legions. Just as he had come to power, many Romans learned to respect Otho in his death. Few could believe that a renowned former companion of Nero had chosen such an honourable end. Tacitus wrote that some of the soldiers committed suicide beside his funeral pyre &quot;because they loved their emperor and wished to share his glory&quot;.

Writing during the reign of the Emperor Domitian (AD 81–96), the Roman poet Martial expressed his admiration for Otho&#x27;s choice to spare the empire from civil war through sacrificing himself:

== Cultural references ==

=== In opera ===

* Otho (or Ottone) is a character in &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; (&quot;The Coronation of Poppaea&quot;), an Italian opera from 1643 by Claudio Monteverdi. Otho is in love with Poppaea but she spurns him. After learning Nero plans to leave her and marry Poppaea, Empress Ottavia orders Otho to kill Poppaea, which he attempts but finds he cannot carry out. He ends the opera in exile with Drusilla, a lady of the court who loves him. 
* Otho is a principal character also in Handel&#x27;s opera &quot;Agrippina&quot; of 1709. Agrippina, Nero&#x27;s mother, is intent on promoting her son&#x27;s claim to the throne. Poppaea, the ingenue, is portrayed as the object of desire of Claudius, Nero, and Otho, whose rivalries Agrippina attempts to leverage to her advantage. Once Poppaea sees through Agrippina&#x27;s deceit, she responds in kind, but only in order to be united with Otho, portrayed as her one true love. 
* Otho (or Ottone) is the title character in Vivaldi&#x27;s opera &quot;Ottone in villa&quot; of 1713. Ottone is in love with Cleonilla, who can&#x27;t resist flirting with two young Romans, Ostilio and Caio. Ostilio is in reality a woman, Tullia, who disguised herself because she&#x27;s in love with Caio.

=== In literature ===

* Otho is a secondary character in the historical fiction novel &quot;Daughters of Rome&quot; by Kate Quinn. The book depicts the Year of the Four Emperors. Otho is portrayed as scheming but also charming. His suicide at the end of the portion of the book dedicated to his reign is depicted as a noble sacrifice. 

=== In film ===

* There have been multiple recorded versions of &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea.&quot; The first was in 1979, a version with the Zurich Opera, and Otho was played by Paul Esswood. In the 2008 production Glyndebourne production, Otho is portrayed by Iestyn Davies. In the 2010 production at the Teatro Real in Madrid, released on DVD in 2012, Max Emanuel Cencic plays Otho. 
* In the 2013 Polish film &quot;Imperator&quot;, done entirely in Latin, Otho is a main character and is portrayed by Robert Wrzosek.

<text>The House of Orsini is an Italian noble family that was one of the most influential princely families in medieval Italy and Renaissance Rome. Members of the Orsini family include five popes: Stephen II (752–757), Paul I (757–767), Celestine III (1191–1198), Nicholas III (1277–1280), and Benedict XIII (1724–1730). The family also included 34 cardinals, numerous &quot;condottieri&quot;, and other significant political and religious figures. The Orsini are part of the Black nobility who were Roman aristocratic families who supported the Popes in the governance of the Papal States.

==Origins==
According to their own family legend, the Orsini are descended from the Julio-Claudian dynasty of ancient Rome. The Orsini carried on a political feud with the Colonna family for centuries in Rome, until it was stopped by Papal Bull in 1511. In 1571, the heads of both families married nieces of Pope Sixtus V as an act of reconciliation. Not really coincidentally, the Colonna family also claims descent from the Julio-Claudian dynasty of ancient Rome.

The Orsini descend from Cajo Orso Orsini who lived c. 600 AD. Five popes are descended from him: Stephen II, Paul I, Celestine III, Nicholas III and Benedict XIII. Some members used the surname of Bobone-Orsini. One member by the name Bobone, lived during the early 11th century, father of Pietro, who was in turn father of Giacinto Bobone (1110–1198), who in 1191 became pope as Celestine III. One of the first great nepotist popes, he made two of his nephews cardinals and allowed his cousin Giovanni Gaetano (Giangaetano, died 1232) to buy the fiefs of Vicovaro, Licenza, Roccagiovine and Nettuno, which formed the nucleus of the future territorial power of the family.

The Bobone surname was lost with his children, who were called &quot;de domo filiorum Ursi&quot;. Two of them, Napoleone and Matteo Rosso the Great (1178–1246), considerably increased the prestige of the family. The former was the founder of the first southern line, which died out with Camillo Pardo in 1553. He obtained the city of Manoppello, later a countship, and was &quot;gonfaloniere&quot; of the Papal States. Matteo Rosso, called the Great, was the effective lord of Rome from 1241, when he defeated the Imperial troops, until 1243, holding the title of Senator. Two of his sons, and Napoleone, were also Senators. Matteo ousted the family&#x27;s traditional rivals, the Colonna family, from Rome and extended the Orsini territories southwards down to Avellino and northwards to Pitigliano. During his life, the family was firmly in the Guelph faction. He had some ten sons, who divided the fiefs after his deaths: Gentile (died 1246) originated the Pitigliano line and the second southern line, Rinaldo that of Monterotondo, Napoleone (died 1267) that of Bracciano, and another Matteo Rosso that of Montegiordano, from the name of the district in Rome housing the family&#x27;s fortress. The most distinguished of his sons was Giovanni Gaetano (died 1280): elected pope as Nicholas III, he named his nephew Bertoldo (d. 1289) as count of Romagna, and had two nephews and a brother created cardinals.

==The second southern line==
The rise of the Orsini did not stop after Nicholas&#x27; death. Bertoldo&#x27;s son, Gentile II (1250–1318), was two times Senator of Rome, podestà of Viterbo and, from 1314, &quot;Gran Giustiziere&quot; (&quot;Great Justicer&quot;) of the Kingdom of Naples. He married Clarice Ruffo, daughter of the counts of Catanzaro, forming an alliance of the most powerful Calabrian dynasty. His son Romano (1268–1327), called Romanello, was Royal Vicar of Rome in 1326, and inherited the countship of Soana through his marriage with Anastasia de Montfort, Countess of Nola. Romano&#x27;s stance was markedly Guelph. After his death, his two sons divided his fiefs, forming the Pitigliano and the second southern line.

Roberto (1295–1345), Gentile II&#x27;s grandson, married Sibilla del Balzo, daughter of the Great Senechal of the Kingdom of Naples. Among his sons, Giacomo (died 13 August 1379; Dean of Salisbury, Archdeacon of Leicester and Archdeacon of Durham) was created cardinal by Gregory XI in 1371, while Nicola (August 27, 1331 – February 14, 1399) obtained the counties of Ariano and Celano. The latter was also Senator of Rome and enlarged the family territories in Lazio and Tuscany.

His second son, Raimondello Orsini del Balzo, supported Charles III&#x27; &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in Naples against Queen Joan I. Under king Ladislaus he was among the few Neapolitan feudataries who were able to maintain their territorial power after the royal war against them. However, at his death in 1406 the southern Orsini fiefs were confiscated. Relationships with the royal family remained cold under Joan II; However, when Raimondello&#x27;s son Giannantonio (1386–1453) sent his troops to help her against the usurpation attempt of James of Bourbon, he received in exchange the Principality of Taranto.

The links with the court increased further under Sergianni Caracciolo, Joan&#x27;s lover and Great Senechal. A younger brother of Giannantonio married one of Sergianni&#x27;s daughters. However, the Orsini changed side when Alfonso V of Aragon started his conquest of the Kingdom of Naples. Giannantonio was awarded with the duchy of Bari, the position of Great Connestable and an appanage of 100,000 &quot;ducati&quot;. Giannantonio remained faithful to Alfonso&#x27;s heir, Ferdinand I, but was killed during a revolt of nobles. Having died without legitimate sons, much of his possessions were absorbed into the Royal Chamber.

==Pitigliano line==
This line was initiated by Guido Orsini, second son of Romano, who inherited the county of Soana, on the western side of Lake Bolsena in southern Tuscany. He and his descendants ruled over the fiefs of Soana, Pitigliano and Nola, but in the early 15th century wars against the Republic of Siena and the Colonnas caused the loss of several territories. Bertoldo (died 1417) managed to keep only Pitigliano, while his grandson Orso (died July 5, 1479) was count of Nola and fought as condottiere under the Duke of Milan and the Republic of Venice. Later he entered the service of Ferdinand I of Naples, but, not having taken part in the Barons&#x27; conspiracy, he was rewarded with the fiefs of Ascoli and Atripalda. He took part in the Aragonese campaign in Tuscany and was killed at the siege of Viterbo.
The most outstanding member of the Pitigliano line was Niccolò, one of the major condottiere of the time. His son Ludovico (died January 27, 1534) and his nephew Enrico (died 1528) participated in the Italian Wars at the service of both France and Spain, often changing side with the typical ease of the Italian military leaders of the time. Two of Ludovico&#x27;s daughters married relevant figures: Geronima to Pier Luigi Farnese, illegitimate son of Pope Paul III and Marzia to Gian Giacomo Medici of Marignano, an important general of the Spanish army.

The line started to decay after the loss of Nola by Ludovico, who was also forced to accept the Sienese suzerainty over Pitigliano. Under his son Giovan Francesco (died May 8, 1567) the county entered the orbit of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Later, the attempt of Alessandro (died February 9, 1604) to obtain the title of Monterotondo was thwarted by Pope Gregory XIII. His son Giannantonio (March 25, 1569 – 1613) sold Pitigliano to Tuscany, in exchange for the marquisate of Monte San Savino.

The line became extinct in 1640 with the death of Alessandro.

==Monterotondo line==
This line was founded by Rinaldo, third son of Matteo Rosso the Great. His son, Napoleone, became a cardinal in 1288 and remained a prominent member of the Curia until his death at Avignon in 1342.

This branch of the family was often involved in the baronial struggles of the Late Middle Ages Rome, at least three members of the family being elected as Senators, while others fought as condottieri. Francesco in 1370 took part to the war of Florence against the Visconti of Milan. Orso (died July 24, 1424) died fighting for the king of Naples in the Battle of Zagonara against the Milanese. His sons Giacomo (died 1482) and Lorenzo (1452) battled for the Papal States, Naples and Florence. One of Giacomo&#x27;s daughters, Clarice (1453–July 30, 1488) became Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s wife. Franciotto Orsini was created cardinal by Leo X in 1517.

The most important member of the Monterotondo Orsinis was Giovani Battista Orsini, who became cardinal under Sixtus IV (1483). He was probably among the promoters of the failed plot against Cesare Borgia in 1502, being assassinated on February 22 of 1503 as retaliation, together with other members of the family: Giulio survived captivity under Cesare, and Paolo and Francesco 4th Duke of Gravina were strangled to death on 18 January 1503.

The line decayed from the late 16th century, when several members were assassinated or lost their lands for various reasons. Its last representatives Enrico (died September 12, 1643) and Francesco (1592 - September 21, 1650) sold Monterotondo to the Barberini in 1641.

==Bracciano line==
Napoleone, another son of Matteo Rosso the Great, received Bracciano, Nerola and other lands in what is now northern Lazio. In 1259 he was Senator of Rome. Thanks to the strategic positions of their fiefs, and to their famous castle built in Bracciano in 1426, they were the most powerful Orsini line in the Lazio. Count Carlo (died after 1485), son of another Napoleone (died October 3, 1480), was Papal Gonfaloniere. By his marriage with a Francesca Orsini of Monterotondo was born Gentile Virginio Orsini, one of the most prominent figures of Italian politics in the late 15th century. After Carlo&#x27;s death, he enlarged the family&#x27;s tenure with lands inherited by his wife, another Orsini from Salerno, and most of all he was amongst the favourites of Ferdinand I of Naples, who appointed him as Great Constable of Naples. Together with his cousin, the Cardinal Giovanni Battista, he was among the fiercest opponents of popes Innocent VIII and Alexander VI. In 1492 Gentile Virginio bought the county of Anguillara from Franceschetto Cybo.

During Charles VIII of France&#x27;s descent into Italy, he managed to keep Bracciano. Ferdinand II had his fiefs confiscated and imprisoned him in Castel dell&#x27;Ovo, where he was poisoned in 1497. The family recovered this setback under the more friendly Medici popes of the early 16th century. His son Gian Giordano was Prince Assistant to the Papal Throne. His nephew Virginio was a famous admiral for the Papal States and France, but in 1539 he had his fiefs confiscated under the charge of treason.

Paolo Giordano was created first Duke of Bracciano in 1560. The son of Girolamo Orsini and Francesca Sforza, he was grandson, on his father&#x27;s side, of Felice della Rovere (illegitimate daughter of Pope Julius II) and Gian Giordano Orsini and, on his mother&#x27;s side, of Count Bosio Sforza and Costanza Farnese, an illegitimate daughter of Pope Paul III. An accomplished condottiero, he was however also a ruthless figure who had his wife Isabella de&#x27; Medici murdered. For this and other homicides he had to flee to northern Italy. He was succeeded by Virginio, whose heir Paolo Giordano II married the princess of Piombino and was created Prince of the Holy Roman Empire. His brother Alessandro was cardinal and Papal legate, and another brother, Ferdinando (died March 4, 1660) acquired the assets of the other line of San Gemini. In the 17th century the Dukes of Bracciano moved their residence to Rome. This, along with a general economical decadence, damaged the dukedom, and last Duke and Prince, Flavio (March 4, 1620 – April 5, 1698) was forced by the huge debts to sell it to Livio Odescalchi.

==Gravina line==

The line of Gravina, from the name of the eponymous city in Apulia, is the only existing line of the Orsini. It descends from Francesco (died 1456), a son of Count Carlo of Bracciano. Most of his fief was located in northern Lazio, but he entered in the Neapolitan orbit when in 1418 he was called by Sergianni Caracciolo to fight against the Angevine troops, which he defeated. By marriage, he obtained the title of Count of Gravina. He was made Duke of Gravina by King Alfonso, a title definitely assigned to his son Giacomo (died 1472), to which had been added the counties of Conversano, Campagna and Copertino. Two of Francesco&#x27;s sons, Marino (died 1471) and Giovanni Battista (died June 8, 1476), were respectively archbishop of Taranto and Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes.

The fourth duke, Francesco, was part of a conspiracy along with his brothers Giulio and Paolo against Cesare Borgia but were found out, and Francesco was strangled to death on 18 January 1503 along with his brother Paolo. One of Francesco&#x27;s nephews, Flavio Orsini, was created cardinal in 1565. The fifth duke, Ferdinando (died December 6, 1549), had all his fiefs confiscated by the Spaniards, but he regained them after a 40,000 scudi payment.

After the heirless death of Duke Michele Antonio (January 26, 1627), his lands passed to his cousin Pietro Orsini, count of Muro Lucano (died 1641). The latter&#x27;s nephew Pier Francesco, who had renounced the succession in favour of his brother Domenico to become a Dominican, was later elected pope with the name of Benedict XIII.

His successor raised Benedict XIII&#x27;s nephew, Prince Beroaldo Orsini, to the dignity of Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne (title held until 1958), after the emperor Charles VI had already, in 1724, made him a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. The last cardinal from the family was Domenico.

This branch of the family moved to Rome in the 18th century, where Duke Domenico (November 23, 1790 – April 28, 1874), married Maria Luisa Torlonia in 1823. In 1850, he was Minister of War and General Lieutenant of the Papal Armies, and also Senator of Rome.

The remaining princely family is represented by Prince Domenico Napoleone Orsini, Duke of Gravina (b. 1948). With no sons or male-line descendants, the heir to the dukedom of Gravina is his brother Don Benedetto Orsini (b. 1956), followed by his cousin Prince Lelio Orsini d&#x27;Aragona (b. 1981), whose mother is Princess Ketevan Bagration of Mukhrani.

==Orsinis in literature==
The Orsini family was briefly mentioned in Boccaccio&#x27;s book &quot;The Decameron&quot; in the 5th day, 3rd story. In the woods, it is described that soldiers from a rival family&#x27;s soldiers attacked a fictional character in the book named Pietro while they had become lost in the woods about eight miles from Rome. Boccaccio describes the soldiers acting to spite of the Orsini&#x27;s. Furthermore, a castle named Campo de&#x27; Fiori, was included in the text. &quot;L&#x27;Idole&quot; (R. Merle) also has Paolo and Lodovico Orsini as main protagonists, since the book is about Vittoria Accoramboni&#x27;s life.
