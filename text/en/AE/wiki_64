<text>Organic electronics is a field of materials science concerning the design, synthesis, characterization, and application of organic molecules or polymers that show desirable electronic properties such as conductivity. Unlike conventional inorganic conductors and semiconductors, organic electronic materials are constructed from organic (carbon-based) molecules or polymers using synthetic strategies developed in the context of organic chemistry and polymer chemistry.

One of the promised benefits of organic electronics is their potential low cost compared to traditional electronics. Attractive properties of polymeric conductors include their electrical conductivity (which can be varied by the concentrations of dopants) and comparatively high mechanical flexibility. Challenges to the implementation of organic electronic materials are their inferior thermal stability, high cost, and diverse fabrication issues.

==History==
===Electrically conductive polymers===
Traditional conductive materials are inorganic, especially metals such as copper and aluminum as well as many alloys.

In 1862 Henry Letheby described polyaniline, which was subsequently shown to be electrically conductive. Work on other polymeric organic materials began in earnest in the 1960s. For example in 1963, a derivative of tetraiodopyrrole was shown to exhibit conductivity of 1 S/cm (S = Siemens). In 1977, it was discovered that oxidation enhanced the conductivity of polyacetylene. The 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Alan J. Heeger, Alan G. MacDiarmid, and Hideki Shirakawa jointly for their work on polyacetylene and related conductive polymers. Many families of electrically conducting polymers have been identified including polythiophene, polyphenylene sulfide, and others.

J.E. Lilienfeld first proposed the field-effect transistor in 1930, but the first OFET was not reported until 1987, when Koezuka et al. constructed one using Polythiophene which shows extremely high conductivity. Other conductive polymers have been shown to act as semiconductors, and newly synthesized and characterized compounds are reported weekly in prominent research journals. Many review articles exist documenting the development of these materials.

In 1987, the first organic diode was produced at Eastman Kodak by Ching W. Tang and Steven Van Slyke.

===Electrically conductive charge transfer salts===
In the 1950s, organic molecules were shown to exhibit electrical conductivity. Specifically, the organic compound pyrene was shown to form semiconducting charge-transfer complex salts with halogens. In 1972, researchers found metallic conductivity (conductivity comparable to a metal) in the charge-transfer complex TTF-TCNQ.

===Light and electrical conductivity===
André Bernanose was the first person to observe electroluminescence in organic materials. Ching W. Tang and Steven Van Slyke, reported fabrication of the first practical OLED device in 1987. The OLED device incorporated a double-layer structure motif composed of copper phthalocyanine and a derivative of perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride.

In 1990, a polymer light emitting diodes was demonstrated by Bradley, Burroughes, Friend. Moving from molecular to macromolecular materials solved the problems previously encountered with the long-term stability of the organic films and enabled high-quality films to be easily made. In the late 1990&#x27;s, highly efficient electroluminescent dopants were shown to dramatically increase the light-emitting efficiency of OLEDs These results suggested that electroluminescent materials could displace traditional hot-filament lighting. Subsequent research developed multilayer polymers and the new field of plastic electronics and organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) research and device production grew rapidly.

==Conductive organic materials==

Organic conductive materials can be grouped into two main classes: polymers and conductive molecular solids and salts. Polycyclic aromatic compounds such as pentacene and rubrene often form semiconducting materials when partially oxidized.

Conductive polymers are often typically intrinsically conductive or at least semiconductors. They sometimes show mechanical properties comparable to those of conventional organic polymers. Both organic synthesis and advanced dispersion techniques can be used to tune the electrical properties of conductive polymers, unlike typical inorganic conductors. Well-studied class of conductive polymers include polyacetylene, polypyrrole, polythiophenes, and polyaniline. Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) and its derivatives are electroluminescent semiconducting polymers. Poly(3-alkythiophenes) have been incorporated into prototypes of solar cells and transistors.

==Organic light-emitting diode==

An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) consists of a thin film of organic material that emits light under stimulation by an electric current. A typical OLED consists of an anode, a cathode, OLED organic material and a conductive layer.

OLED organic materials can be divided into two major families: small-molecule-based and polymer-based. Small molecule OLEDs (SM-OLEDs) include tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium fluorescent and phosphorescent dyes, and conjugated dendrimers. Fluorescent dyes can be selected according to the desired range of emission wavelengths; compounds like perylene and rubrene are often used. Devices based on small molecules are usually fabricated by thermal evaporation under vacuum. While this method enables the formation of well-controlled homogeneous film; is hampered by high cost and limited scalability.
 Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) are generally more efficient than SM-OLEDs. Common polymers used in PLEDs include derivatives of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) and polyfluorene. The emitted color is determined by the structure of the polymer. Compared to thermal evaporation, solution-based methods are more suited to creating films with large dimensions.

==Organic field-effect transistor==
An organic field-effect transistor (OFET) is a field-effect transistor utilizing organic molecules or polymers as the active semiconducting layer. A field-effect transistor (FET) is any semiconductor material that utilizes electric field to control the shape of a channel of one type of charge carrier, thereby changing its conductivity. Two major classes of FET are n-type and p-type semiconductor, classified according to the charge type carried. In the case of organic FETs (OFETs), p-type OFET compounds are generally more stable than n-type due to the susceptibility of the latter to oxidative damage.

As for OLEDs, some OFETs are molecular and some are polymer-based system. Rubrene-based OFETs show high carrier mobility of 20–40 cm2/(V·s). Another popular OFET material is Pentacene. Due to its low solubility in most organic solvents, it&#x27;s difficult to fabricate thin film transistors (TFTs) from pentacene itself using conventional spin-cast or, dip coating methods, but this obstacle can be overcome by using the derivative TIPS-pentacene.

==Organic electronic devices==

Organic solar cells could cut the cost of solar power compared with conventional solar-cell manufacturing. Silicon thin-film solar cells on flexible substrates allow a significant cost reduction of large-area photovoltaics for several reasons:

# The so-called &#x27;roll-to-roll&#x27;-deposition on flexible sheets is much easier to realize in terms of technological effort than deposition on fragile and heavy glass sheets.
# Transport and installation of lightweight flexible solar cells also saves cost as compared to cells on glass.

Inexpensive polymeric substrates like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polycarbonate (PC) have the potential for further cost reduction in photovoltaics. Protomorphous solar cells prove to be a promising concept for efficient and low-cost photovoltaics on cheap and flexible substrates for large-area production as well as small and mobile applications.

One advantage of printed electronics is that different electrical and electronic components can be printed on top of each other, saving space and increasing reliability and sometimes they are all transparent. One ink must not damage another, and low temperature annealing is vital if low-cost flexible materials such as paper and plastic film are to be used. There is much sophisticated engineering and chemistry involved here, with iTi, Pixdro, Asahi Kasei, Merck &amp; Co.|Merck, BASF, HC Starck, Sunew, Hitachi Chemical, and Frontier Carbon Corporation among the leaders.
Electronic devices based on organic compounds are now widely used, with many new products under development. Sony reported the first full-color, video-rate, flexible, plastic display made purely of organic materials; television screen based on OLED materials; biodegradable electronics based on organic compound and low-cost organic solar cell are also available.

===Fabrication methods===
Small molecule semiconductors are often insoluble, necessitating deposition via vacuum sublimation. Devices based on conductive polymers can be prepared by solution processing methods. Both solution processing and vacuum based methods produce amorphous and polycrystalline films with variable degree of disorder. &quot;Wet&quot; coating techniques require polymers to be dissolved in a volatile solvent, filtered and deposited onto a substrate. Common examples of solvent-based coating techniques include drop casting, spin-coating, doctor-blading, inkjet printing and screen printing. Spin-coating is a widely used technique for small area thin film production. It may result in a high degree of material loss. The doctor-blade technique results in a minimal material loss and was primarily developed for large area thin film production. Vacuum based thermal deposition of small molecules requires evaporation of molecules from a hot source. The molecules are then transported through vacuum onto a substrate. The process of condensing these molecules on the substrate surface results in thin film formation. Wet coating techniques can in some cases be applied to small molecules depending on their solubility.

===Organic solar cells===

Organic semiconductor diodes convert light into electricity. Figure to the right shows five commonly used organic photovoltaic materials. Electrons in these organic molecules can be delocalized in a delocalized π orbital with a corresponding π* antibonding orbital. The difference in energy between the π orbital, or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and π* orbital, or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is called the band gap of organic photovoltaic materials. Typically, the band gap lies in the range of 1-4eV.

The difference in the band gap of organic photovoltaic materials leads to different chemical structures and forms of organic solar cells. Different forms of solar cells includes single-layer organic photovoltaic cells, bilayer organic photovoltaic cells and heterojunction photovoltaic cells. However, all three of these types of solar cells share the approach of sandwiching the organic electronic layer between two metallic conductors, typically indium tin oxide.
===Organic field-effect transistors===
An organic field-effect transistor is a three terminal device (source, drain and gate). The charge carriers move between source and drain, and the gate serves to control the path&#x27;s conductivity. There are mainly two types of organic field-effect transistor, based on the semiconducting layer&#x27;s charge transport, namely p-type (such as dinaphtho[2,3-&quot;b&quot;:2′,3′-&quot;f&quot;]thieno[3,2-&quot;b&quot;]thiophene, DNTT), and n-type (such phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM). Certain organic semiconductors can also present both p-type and n-type (i.e., ambipolar) characteristics.

Such technology allows for the fabrication of large-area, flexible, low-cost electronics. One of the main advantages is that being mainly a low temperature process compared to CMOS, different type of materials can be utilized. This makes them in turn great candidates for sensing.

==Features==
Conductive polymers are lighter, more flexible, and less expensive than inorganic conductors. This makes them a desirable alternative in many applications. It also creates the possibility of new applications that would be impossible using copper or silicon.

Organic electronics not only includes organic semiconductors, but also organic dielectrics, conductors and light emitters.

New applications include smart windows and electronic paper. Conductive polymers are expected to play an important role in the emerging science of molecular computers.

<text>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, peripherals, and other resources.

For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computerfrom cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.

, Android is the most popular operating system with a 46% market share, followed by Microsoft Windows at 26%, iOS and iPadOS at 18%, macOS at 5%, and Linux at 1%. Android, iOS, and iPadOS are mobile operating systems, while Windows, macOS, and Linux are desktop operating systems. Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems (special-purpose operating systems), such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications. Security-focused operating systems also exist. Some operating systems have low system requirements (e.g. light-weight Linux distribution). Others may have higher system requirements.

Some operating systems require installation or may come pre-installed with purchased computers (OEM-installation), whereas others may run directly from media (i.e. live CD) or flash memory (i.e. USB stick).

==Definition and purpose==
An operating system is difficult to define, but has been called &quot;the layer of software that manages a computer&#x27;s resources for its users and their applications&quot;. Operating systems include the software that is always running, called a kernel—but can include other software as well. The two other types of programs that can run on a computer are system programs—which are associated with the operating system, but may not be part of the kernel—and applications—all other software.

There are three main purposes that an operating system fulfills:
*Operating systems allocate resources between different applications, deciding when they will receive central processing unit (CPU) time or space in memory. On modern personal computers, users often want to run several applications at once. In order to ensure that one program cannot monopolize the computer&#x27;s limited hardware resources, the operating system gives each application a share of the resource, either in time (CPU) or space (memory). The operating system also must isolate applications from each other to protect them from errors and security vulnerabilities in another application&#x27;s code, but enable communications between different applications.
*Operating systems provide an interface that abstracts the details of accessing hardware details (such as physical memory) to make things easier for programmers. Virtualization also enables the operating system to mask limited hardware resources; for example, virtual memory can provide a program with the illusion of nearly unlimited memory that exceeds the computer&#x27;s actual memory.
*Operating systems provide common services, such as an interface for accessing network and disk devices. This enables an application to be run on different hardware without needing to be rewritten. Which services to include in an operating system varies greatly, and this functionality makes up the great majority of code for most operating systems.

==Types of operating systems==
===Multicomputer operating systems===
With multiprocessors multiple CPUs share memory. A multicomputer or cluster computer has multiple CPUs, each of which has its own memory. Multicomputers were developed because large multiprocessors are difficult to engineer and prohibitively expensive; they are universal in cloud computing because of the size of the machine needed. The different CPUs often need to send and receive messages to each other; to ensure good performance, the operating systems for these machines need to minimize this copying of packets. Newer systems are often multiqueue—separating groups of users into separate queues—to reduce the need for packet copying and support more concurrent users. Another technique is remote direct memory access, which enables each CPU to access memory belonging to other CPUs. Multicomputer operating systems often support remote procedure calls where a CPU can call a procedure on another CPU, or distributed shared memory, in which the operating system uses virtualization to generate shared memory that does not physically exist.

===Distributed systems===
A distributed system is a group of distinct, networked computers—each of which might have their own operating system and file system. Unlike multicomputers, they may be dispersed anywhere in the world. Middleware, an additional software layer between the operating system and applications, is often used to improve consistency. Although it functions similarly to an operating system, it is not a true operating system.

===Embedded===
Embedded operating systems are designed to be used in embedded computer systems, whether they are internet of things objects or not connected to a network. Embedded systems include many household appliances. The distinguishing factor is that they do not load user-installed software. Consequently, they do not need protection between different applications, enabling simpler designs. Very small operating systems might run in less than 10 kilobytes, and the smallest are for smart cards. Examples include Embedded Linux, QNX, VxWorks, and the extra-small systems RIOT and TinyOS.

===Real-time===
A real-time operating system is an operating system that guarantees to process events or data by or at a specific moment in time. Hard real-time systems require exact timing and are common in manufacturing, avionics, military, and other similar uses. With soft real-time systems, the occasional missed event is acceptable; this category often includes audio or multimedia systems, as well as smartphones. In order for hard real-time systems be sufficiently exact in their timing, often they are just a library with no protection between applications, such as eCos.

===Hypervisor===
A hypervisor is an operating system that runs a virtual machine. The virtual machine is unaware that it is an application and operates as if it had its own hardware. Virtual machines can be paused, saved, and resumed, making them useful for operating systems research, development, and debugging. They also enhance portability by enabling applications to be run on a computer even if they are not compatible with the base operating system.

===Library===
A &quot;library operating system&quot; (libOS) is one in which the services that a typical operating system provides, such as networking, are provided in the form of libraries and composed with a single application and configuration code to construct a unikernel:
 a specialized (only the absolute necessary pieces of code are extracted from libraries and bound together
), single address space, machine image that can be deployed to cloud or embedded environments.

The operating system code and application code are not executed in separated protection domains (there is only a single application running, at least conceptually, so there is no need to prevent interference between applications) and OS services are accessed via simple library calls (potentially inlining them based on compiler thresholds), without the usual overhead of context switches,
 in a way similarly to embedded and real-time OSes. Note that this overhead is not negligible: to the direct cost of mode switching it&#x27;s necessary to add the indirect pollution of important processor structures (like CPU caches, the instruction pipeline, and so on) which affects both user-mode and kernel-mode performance.
==History==

The first computers in the late 1940s and 1950s were directly programmed either with plugboards or with machine code inputted on media such as punch cards, without programming languages or operating systems. After the introduction of the transistor in the mid-1950s, mainframes began to be built. These still needed professional operators who manually do what a modern operating system would do, such as scheduling programs to run, but mainframes still had rudimentary operating systems such as Fortran Monitor System (FMS) and IBSYS. In the 1960s, IBM introduced the first series of intercompatible computers (System/360). All of them ran the same operating system—OS/360—which consisted of millions of lines of assembly language that had thousands of bugs. The OS/360 also was the first popular operating system to support multiprogramming, such that the CPU could be put to use on one job while another was waiting on input/output (I/O). Holding multiple jobs in memory necessitated memory partitioning and safeguards against one job accessing the memory allocated to a different one.

Around the same time, teleprinters began to be used as terminals so multiple users could access the computer simultaneously. The operating system MULTICS was intended to allow hundreds of users to access a large computer. Despite its limited adoption, it can be considered the precursor to cloud computing. The UNIX operating system originated as a development of MULTICS for a single user. Because UNIX&#x27;s source code was available, it became the basis of other, incompatible operating systems, of which the most successful were AT&amp;T&#x27;s System V and the University of California&#x27;s Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). To increase compatibility, the IEEE released the POSIX standard for operating system application programming interfaces (APIs), which is supported by most UNIX systems. MINIX was a stripped-down version of UNIX, developed in 1987 for educational uses, that inspired the commercially available, free software Linux. Since 2008, MINIX is used in controllers of most Intel microchips, while Linux is widespread in data centers and Android smartphones.

===Microcomputers===
The invention of large scale integration enabled the production of personal computers (initially called microcomputers) from around 1980. For around five years, the CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers) was the most popular operating system for microcomputers. Later, IBM bought the DOS (Disk Operating System) from Microsoft. After modifications requested by IBM, the resulting system was called MS-DOS ( Disk Operating System) and was widely used on IBM microcomputers. Later versions increased their sophistication, in part by borrowing features from UNIX.

Apple&#x27;s Macintosh was the first popular computer to use a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI proved much more user friendly than the text-only command-line interface earlier operating systems had used. Following the success of Macintosh, MS-DOS was updated with a GUI overlay called Windows. Windows later was rewritten as a stand-alone operating system, borrowing so many features from another (VAX VMS) that a large legal settlement was paid. In the twenty-first century, Windows continues to be popular on personal computers but has less market share of servers. UNIX operating systems, especially Linux, are the most popular on enterprise systems and servers but are also used on mobile devices and many other computer systems.

On mobile devices, Symbian OS was dominant at first, being usurped by BlackBerry OS (introduced 2002) and iOS for iPhones (from 2007). Later on, the open-source Android operating system (introduced 2008), with a Linux kernel and a C library (Bionic) partially based on BSD code, became most popular.

==Components==
The components of an operating system are designed to ensure that various parts of a computer function cohesively. With the de facto obsoletion of DOS, all user software must interact with the operating system to access hardware.

===Kernel===

The kernel is the part of the operating system that provides protection between different applications and users. This protection is key to improving reliability by keeping errors isolated to one program, as well as security by limiting the power of malicious software and protecting private data, and ensuring that one program cannot monopolize the computer&#x27;s resources. Most operating systems have two modes of operation: in user mode, the hardware checks that the software is only executing legal instructions, whereas the kernel has unrestricted powers and is not subject to these checks. The kernel also manages memory for other processes and controls access to input/output devices.

====Program execution====
The operating system provides an interface between an application program and the computer hardware, so that an application program can interact with the hardware only by obeying rules and procedures programmed into the operating system. The operating system is also a set of services which simplify development and execution of application programs. Executing an application program typically involves the creation of a process by the operating system kernel, which assigns memory space and other resources, establishes a priority for the process in multi-tasking systems, loads program binary code into memory, and initiates execution of the application program, which then interacts with the user and with hardware devices. However, in some systems an application can request that the operating system execute another application within the same process, either as a subroutine or in a separate thread, e.g., the LINK and ATTACH facilities of OS/360 and successors.

====Interrupts====
An interrupt (also known as an abort, exception, &quot;fault&quot;, signal, or &quot;trap&quot;) provides an efficient way for most operating systems to react to the environment. Interrupts cause the central processing unit (CPU) to have a control flow change away from the currently running program to an interrupt handler, also known as an interrupt service routine (ISR). An interrupt service routine may cause the central processing unit (CPU) to have a context switch. The details of how a computer processes an interrupt vary from architecture to architecture, and the details of how interrupt service routines behave vary from operating system to operating system. However, several interrupt functions are common. The architecture and operating system must:
# transfer control to an interrupt service routine.
# save the state of the currently running process.
# restore the state after the interrupt is serviced.

=====Software interrupt=====
A software interrupt is a message to a process that an event has occurred. This contrasts with a &quot;hardware interrupt&quot; — which is a message to the central processing unit (CPU) that an event has occurred. Software interrupts are similar to hardware interrupts — there is a change away from the currently running process. Similarly, both hardware and software interrupts execute an interrupt service routine.

Software interrupts may be normally occurring events. It is expected that a time slice will occur, so the kernel will have to perform a context switch. A computer program may set a timer to go off after a few seconds in case too much data causes an algorithm to take too long.

Software interrupts may be error conditions, such as a malformed machine instruction. However, the most common error conditions are division by zero and accessing an invalid memory address.

Users can send messages to the kernel to modify the behavior of a currently running process. For example, in the command-line environment, pressing the &quot;interrupt character&quot; (usually Control-C) might terminate the currently running process.

To generate &quot;software interrupts&quot; for x86 CPUs, the INT assembly language instruction is available. The syntax is codice_1, where codice_2 is the offset number (in hexadecimal format) to the interrupt vector table.

=====Signal=====
To generate &quot;software interrupts&quot; in Unix-like operating systems, the codice_3 system call will send a signal to another process. codice_4 is the process identifier of the receiving process. codice_5 is the signal number (in mnemonic format) to be sent. (The abrasive name of codice_6 was chosen because early implementations only terminated the process.)

In Unix-like operating systems, &quot;signals&quot; inform processes of the occurrence of asynchronous events. To communicate asynchronously, interrupts are required. One reason a process needs to asynchronously communicate to another process solves a variation of the classic reader/writer problem. The writer receives a pipe from the shell for its output to be sent to the reader&#x27;s input stream. The command-line syntax is codice_7. codice_8 will write to the pipe when its computation is ready and then sleep in the wait queue. codice_9 will then be moved to the ready queue and soon will read from its input stream. The kernel will generate &quot;software interrupts&quot; to coordinate the piping.

&quot;Signals&quot; may be classified into 7 categories. The categories are:
# when a process finishes normally.
# when a process has an error exception.
# when a process runs out of a system resource.
# when a process executes an illegal instruction.
# when a process sets an alarm event.
# when a process is aborted from the keyboard.
# when a process has a tracing alert for debugging.

=====Hardware interrupt=====
Input/output (I/O) devices are slower than the CPU. Therefore, it would slow down the computer if the CPU had to wait for each I/O to finish. Instead, a computer may implement interrupts for I/O completion, avoiding the need for polling or busy waiting.

Some computers require an interrupt for each character or word, costing a significant amount of CPU time. Direct memory access (DMA) is an architecture feature to allow devices to bypass the CPU and access main memory directly. (Separate from the architecture, a device may perform direct memory access to and from main memory either directly or via a bus.)

====Input/output====

=====Interrupt-driven I/O=====

When a computer user types a key on the keyboard, typically the character appears immediately on the screen. Likewise, when a user moves a mouse, the cursor immediately moves across the screen. Each keystroke and mouse movement generates an &quot;interrupt&quot; called &quot;Interrupt-driven I/O&quot;. An interrupt-driven I/O occurs when a process causes an interrupt for every character or word transmitted.

=====Direct memory access=====
Devices such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives, and magnetic tape drives can transfer data at a rate high enough that interrupting the CPU for every byte or word transferred, and having the CPU transfer the byte or word between the device and memory, would require too much CPU time. Data is, instead, transferred between the device and memory independently of the CPU by hardware such as a channel or a direct memory access controller; an interrupt is delivered only when all the data is transferred.

If a computer program executes a system call to perform a block I/O &quot;write&quot; operation, then the system call might execute the following instructions:
* Set the contents of the CPU&#x27;s registers (including the program counter) into the process control block.
* Create an entry in the device-status table. The operating system maintains this table to keep track of which processes are waiting for which devices. One field in the table is the memory address of the process control block.
* Place all the characters to be sent to the device into a memory buffer.
* Set the memory address of the memory buffer to a predetermined device register.
* Set the buffer size (an integer) to another predetermined register.
* Execute the machine instruction to begin the writing.
* Perform a context switch to the next process in the ready queue.

While the writing takes place, the operating system will context switch to other processes as normal. When the device finishes writing, the device will &quot;interrupt&quot; the currently running process by &quot;asserting&quot; an interrupt request. The device will also place an integer onto the data bus. Upon accepting the interrupt request, the operating system will:
* Push the contents of the program counter (a register) followed by the status register onto the call stack.
* Push the contents of the other registers onto the call stack. (Alternatively, the contents of the registers may be placed in a system table.)
* Read the integer from the data bus. The integer is an offset to the interrupt vector table. The vector table&#x27;s instructions will then:
:* Access the device-status table.
:* Extract the process control block.
:* Perform a context switch back to the writing process.

When the writing process has its time slice expired, the operating system will:
* Pop from the call stack the registers other than the status register and program counter.
* Pop from the call stack the status register.
* Pop from the call stack the address of the next instruction, and set it back into the program counter.

With the program counter now reset, the interrupted process will resume its time slice.

====Memory management====
Among other things, a multiprogramming operating system kernel must be responsible for managing all system memory which is currently in use by the programs. This ensures that a program does not interfere with memory already in use by another program. Since programs time share, each program must have independent access to memory.

Cooperative memory management, used by many early operating systems, assumes that all programs make voluntary use of the kernel&#x27;s memory manager, and do not exceed their allocated memory. This system of memory management is almost never seen anymore, since programs often contain bugs which can cause them to exceed their allocated memory. If a program fails, it may cause memory used by one or more other programs to be affected or overwritten. Malicious programs or viruses may purposefully alter another program&#x27;s memory, or may affect the operation of the operating system itself. With cooperative memory management, it takes only one misbehaved program to crash the system.

Memory protection enables the kernel to limit a process&#x27; access to the computer&#x27;s memory. Various methods of memory protection exist, including memory segmentation and paging. All methods require some level of hardware support (such as the 80286 MMU), which does not exist in all computers.

In both segmentation and paging, certain protected mode registers specify to the CPU what memory address it should allow a running program to access. Attempts to access other addresses trigger an interrupt, which causes the CPU to re-enter supervisor mode, placing the kernel in charge. This is called a segmentation violation or Seg-V for short, and since it is both difficult to assign a meaningful result to such an operation, and because it is usually a sign of a misbehaving program, the kernel generally resorts to terminating the offending program, and reports the error.

Windows versions 3.1 through ME had some level of memory protection, but programs could easily circumvent the need to use it. A general protection fault would be produced, indicating a segmentation violation had occurred; however, the system would often crash anyway.

====Virtual memory====


The use of virtual memory addressing (such as paging or segmentation) means that the kernel can choose what memory each program may use at any given time, allowing the operating system to use the same memory locations for multiple tasks.

If a program tries to access memory that is not accessible memory, but nonetheless has been allocated to it, the kernel is interrupted . This kind of interrupt is typically a page fault.

When the kernel detects a page fault it generally adjusts the virtual memory range of the program which triggered it, granting it access to the memory requested. This gives the kernel discretionary power over where a particular application&#x27;s memory is stored, or even whether or not it has been allocated yet.

In modern operating systems, memory which is accessed less frequently can be temporarily stored on a disk or other media to make that space available for use by other programs. This is called swapping, as an area of memory can be used by multiple programs, and what that memory area contains can be swapped or exchanged on demand.

Virtual memory provides the programmer or the user with the perception that there is a much larger amount of RAM in the computer than is really there.

===Concurrency===
Concurrency refers to the operating system&#x27;s ability to carry out multiple tasks simultaneously. Virtually all modern operating systems support concurrency.

Threads enable splitting a process&#x27; work into multiple parts that can run simultaneously. The number of threads is not limited by the number of processors available. If there are more threads than processors, the operating system kernel schedules, suspends, and resumes threads, controlling when each thread runs and how much CPU time it receives. During a context switch a running thread is suspended, its state is saved into the thread control block and stack, and the state of the new thread is loaded in. Historically, on many systems a thread could run until it relinquished control (cooperative multitasking). Because this model can allow a single thread to monopolize the processor, most operating systems now can interrupt a thread (preemptive multitasking).

Threads have their own thread ID, program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack, but share code, heap data, and other resources with other threads of the same process. Thus, there is less overhead to create a thread than a new process. On single-CPU systems, concurrency is switching between processes. Many computers have multiple CPUs. Parallelism with multiple threads running on different CPUs can speed up a program, depending on how much of it can be executed concurrently.

===File system===


Permanent storage devices used in twenty-first century computers, unlike volatile dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), are still accessible after a crash or power failure. Permanent (non-volatile) storage is much cheaper per byte, but takes several orders of magnitude longer to access, read, and write. The two main technologies are a hard drive consisting of magnetic disks, and flash memory (a solid-state drive that stores data in electrical circuits). The latter is more expensive but faster and more durable.

File systems are an abstraction used by the operating system to simplify access to permanent storage. They provide human-readable filenames and other metadata, increase performance via amortization of accesses, prevent multiple threads from accessing the same section of memory, and include checksums to identify corruption. File systems are composed of files (named collections of data, of an arbitrary size) and directories (also called folders) that list human-readable filenames and other directories. An absolute file path begins at the root directory and lists subdirectories divided by punctuation, while a relative path defines the location of a file from a directory.

System calls (which are sometimes wrapped by libraries) enable applications to create, delete, open, and close files, as well as link, read, and write to them. All these operations are carried out by the operating system on behalf of the application. The operating system&#x27;s efforts to reduce latency include storing recently requested blocks of memory in a cache and prefetching data that the application has not asked for, but might need next. Device drivers are software specific to each input/output (I/O) device that enables the operating system to work without modification over different hardware.

Another component of file systems is a dictionary that maps a file&#x27;s name and metadata to the data block where its contents are stored. Most file systems use directories to convert file names to file numbers. To find the block number, the operating system uses an index (often implemented as a tree). Separately, there is a free space map to track free blocks, commonly implemented as a bitmap. Although any free block can be used to store a new file, many operating systems try to group together files in the same directory to maximize performance, or periodically reorganize files to reduce fragmentation.

Maintaining data reliability in the face of a computer crash or hardware failure is another concern. File writing protocols are designed with atomic operations so as not to leave permanent storage in a partially written, inconsistent state in the event of a crash at any point during writing. Data corruption is addressed by redundant storage (for example, RAID—redundant array of inexpensive disks) and checksums to detect when data has been corrupted. With multiple layers of checksums and backups of a file, a system can recover from multiple hardware failures. Background processes are often used to detect and recover from data corruption.

===Security===
Security means protecting users from other users of the same computer, as well as from those who seeking remote access to it over a network. Operating systems security rests on achieving the CIA triad: confidentiality (unauthorized users cannot access data), integrity (unauthorized users cannot modify data), and availability (ensuring that the system remains available to authorized users, even in the event of a denial of service attack). As with other computer systems, isolating security domains—in the case of operating systems, the kernel, processes, and virtual machines—is key to achieving security. Other ways to increase security include simplicity to minimize the attack surface, locking access to resources by default, checking all requests for authorization, principle of least authority (granting the minimum privilege essential for performing a task), privilege separation, and reducing shared data.

Some operating system designs are more secure than others. Those with no isolation between the kernel and applications are least secure, while those with a monolithic kernel like most general-purpose operating systems are still vulnerable if any part of the kernel is compromised. A more secure design features microkernels that separate the kernel&#x27;s privileges into many separate security domains and reduce the consequences of a single kernel breach. Unikernels are another approach that improves security by minimizing the kernel and separating out other operating systems functionality by application.

Most operating systems are written in C or C++, which create potential vulnerabilities for exploitation. Despite attempts to protect against them, vulnerabilities are caused by buffer overflow attacks, which are enabled by the lack of bounds checking. Hardware vulnerabilities, some of them caused by CPU optimizations, can also be used to compromise the operating system. There are known instances of operating system programmers deliberately implanting vulnerabilities, such as back doors.

Operating systems security is hampered by their increasing complexity and the resulting inevitability of bugs. Because formal verification of operating systems may not be feasible, developers use operating system hardening to reduce vulnerabilities, e.g. address space layout randomization, control-flow integrity, access restrictions, and other techniques. There are no restrictions on who can contribute code to open source operating systems; such operating systems have transparent change histories and distributed governance structures. Open source developers strive to work collaboratively to find and eliminate security vulnerabilities, using code review and type checking to expunge malicious code. Andrew S. Tanenbaum advises releasing the source code of all operating systems, arguing that it prevents developers from placing trust in secrecy and thus relying on the unreliable practice of security by obscurity.

===User interface===
A user interface (UI) is essential to support human interaction with a computer. The two most common user interface types for any computer are

*command-line interface, where computer commands are typed, line-by-line,
*graphical user interface (GUI) using a visual environment, most commonly a combination of the window, icon, menu, and pointer elements, also known as WIMP.

For personal computers, including smartphones and tablet computers, and for workstations, user input is typically from a combination of keyboard, mouse, and trackpad or touchscreen, all of which are connected to the operating system with specialized software. Personal computer users who are not software developers or coders often prefer GUIs for both input and output; GUIs are supported by most personal computers. The software to support GUIs is more complex than a command line for input and plain text output. Plain text output is often preferred by programmers, and is easy to support.

==Operating system development as a hobby==

A hobby operating system may be classified as one whose code has not been directly derived from an existing operating system, and has few users and active developers.

In some cases, hobby development is in support of a &quot;homebrew&quot; computing device, for example, a simple single-board computer powered by a 6502 microprocessor. Or, development may be for an architecture already in widespread use. Operating system development may come from entirely new concepts, or may commence by modeling an existing operating system. In either case, the hobbyist is her/his own developer, or may interact with a small and sometimes unstructured group of individuals who have like interests.

Examples of hobby operating systems include Syllable and TempleOS.

==Diversity of operating systems and portability==
If an application is written for use on a specific operating system, and is ported to another OS, the functionality required by that application may be implemented differently by that OS (the names of functions, meaning of arguments, etc.) requiring the application to be adapted, changed, or otherwise maintained.

This cost in supporting operating systems diversity can be avoided by instead writing applications against software platforms such as Java or Qt. These abstractions have already borne the cost of adaptation to specific operating systems and their system libraries.

Another approach is for operating system vendors to adopt standards. For example, POSIX and OS abstraction layers provide commonalities that reduce porting costs.

==Popular operating systems==
, Android is the most popular operating system with a 46% market share, followed by Microsoft Windows at 26%, iOS and iPadOS at 18%, macOS at 5%, and Linux at 1%. Android, iOS, and iPadOS are mobile operating systems, while Windows, macOS, and Linux are desktop operating systems.

===Linux===
Linux is a free software distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which means that all of its derivatives are legally required to release their source code. Linux was designed by programmers for their own use, thus emphasizing simplicity and consistency, with a small number of basic elements that can be combined in nearly unlimited ways, and avoiding redundancy.

Its design is similar to other UNIX systems not using a microkernel. It is written in C and uses UNIX System V syntax, but also supports BSD syntax. Linux supports standard UNIX networking features, as well as the full suite of UNIX tools, while supporting multiple users and employing preemptive multitasking. Initially of a minimalist design, Linux is a flexible system that can work in under 16 MB of RAM, but still is used on large multiprocessor systems. Similar to other UNIX systems, Linux distributions are composed of a kernel, system libraries, and system utilities. Linux has a graphical user interface (GUI) with a desktop, folder and file icons, as well as the option to access the operating system via a command line.

Android is a partially open-source operating system closely based on Linux and has become the most widely used operating system by users, due to its popularity on smartphones and, to a lesser extent, embedded systems needing a GUI, such as &quot;smart watches, automotive dashboards, airplane seatbacks, medical devices, and home appliances&quot;. Unlike Linux, much of Android is written in Java and uses object-oriented design.

===Microsoft Windows===
Windows is a proprietary operating system that is widely used on desktop computers, laptops, tablets, phones, workstations, enterprise servers, and Xbox consoles. The operating system was designed for &quot;security, reliability, compatibility, high performance, extensibility, portability, and international support&quot;—later on, energy efficiency and support for dynamic devices also became priorities.

Windows Executive works via kernel-mode objects for important data structures like processes, threads, and sections (memory objects, for example files). The operating system supports demand paging of virtual memory, which speeds up I/O for many applications. I/O device drivers use the Windows Driver Model. The NTFS file system has a master table and each file is represented as a record with metadata. The scheduling includes preemptive multitasking. Windows has many security features; especially important are the use of access-control lists and integrity levels. Every process has an authentication token and each object is given a security descriptor. Later releases have added even more security features.

<text>George Orson Welles (May 6, 1915 – October 10, 1985) was an American director, actor, writer, and producer who is remembered for his innovative work in film, radio, and theatre. He is considered to be among the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time.

At age 21, Welles was directing high-profile stage productions for the Federal Theatre Project in New York City—starting with a celebrated 1936 adaptation of &quot;Macbeth&quot; with an African-American cast, and ending with the controversial labor opera &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; in 1937. He and John Houseman then founded the Mercury Theatre, an independent repertory theatre company that presented a series of productions on Broadway through 1941, including a modern, politically charged &quot;Caesar&quot; (1937). In 1938, his radio anthology series &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; gave Welles the platform to find international fame as the director and narrator of a radio adaptation of H. G. Wells&#x27;s novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, which caused some listeners to believe that a Martian invasion was in fact occurring. The event rocketed the 23-year-old Welles to notoriety.

His first film was &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), which he co-wrote, produced, directed and starred in as the title character, Charles Foster Kane. Cecilia Ager, reviewing it in &quot;PM Magazine&quot;, wrote: “Seeing it, it’s as if you never really saw a movie before.” It has been consistently ranked as the greatest film ever made. He directed twelve other features, the most acclaimed of which include &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942), &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot; (1947), &quot;Othello&quot; (1951), &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958), &quot;The Trial&quot; (1962), &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; (1966), and &quot;F for Fake&quot; (1973). Welles also acted in other directors&#x27; films, playing Rochester in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1943), Harry Lime in &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), and Cardinal Wolsey in &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966). 

His distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms, dramatic lighting, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots and long takes. He has been praised as &quot;the ultimate . Welles was an outsider to the studio system and struggled for creative control on his projects early on with the major film studios in Hollywood and later in life with a variety of independent financiers across Europe, where he spent most of his career. Many of his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased.

Welles received an Academy Award and three Grammy Awards among other numerous honors such as the Golden Lion in 1947, the Palme D&#x27;Or in 1952, the Academy Honorary Award in 1970, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1975, and the British Film Institute Fellowship in 1983. In 2002, he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two British Film Institute polls among directors and critics. In 2018, he was included in the list of the 50 greatest Hollywood actors of all time by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Micheál Mac Liammóir, who worked with the 16-year-old Welles on the stage in Dublin and later played Iago in his film &quot;Othello&quot; (1951), wrote that &quot;Orson&#x27;s courage, like everything else about him, imagination, egotism, generosity, ruthlessness, forbearance, impatience, sensitivity, grossness and vision is magnificently out of proportion.&quot;
== Early life (1915–1931) ==

George Orson Welles was born May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a son of Richard Head Welles and Beatrice Ives Welles (&quot;née&quot; Beatrice Lucy Ives). He was named after one of his great-grandfathers, Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head, and his brother George Head.

Despite his family&#x27;s affluence, Welles encountered hardship in childhood when his parents separated and moved to Chicago in 1919. His father, who made a fortune as the inventor of a popular bicycle lamp, became an alcoholic and stopped working. Welles&#x27;s mother was a concert pianist who had studied with the Lithuanian-born pianist-composer Leopold Godowsky. She played during lectures by Dudley Crafts Watson at the Art Institute of Chicago to support her son and herself. As a boy, Welles received piano and violin lessons arranged by his mother. The older Welles boy, &quot;Dickie&quot;, was institutionalized at an early age because he had learning difficulties. Beatrice died of hepatitis in a Chicago hospital on May 10, 1924, just after Welles&#x27;s ninth birthday. The Gordon String Quartet, a predecessor to the Berkshire String Quartet, which had made its first appearance at her home in 1921, played at Beatrice&#x27;s funeral.

After his mother&#x27;s death, Welles ceased pursuing a musical career. It was decided that he would spend the summer with the Watson family at a private art colony established by Lydia Avery Coonley Ward in the village of Wyoming in the Finger Lakes Region of New York. There, he played and became friends with the children of the Aga Khan, including the 12-year-old Prince Aly Khan. Then, in what Welles later described as &quot;a hectic period&quot; in his life, he lived in a Chicago apartment with both his father and Maurice Bernstein, a Chicago physician who had been a close friend of both his parents. Welles briefly attended public school before his alcoholic father left business altogether and took him along on his travels to Jamaica and the Far East. When they returned, they settled in a hotel in Grand Detour, Illinois, that was owned by his father. When the hotel burned down, Welles and his father took to the road again.

&quot;During the three years that Orson lived with his father, some observers wondered who took care of whom,&quot; wrote biographer Frank Brady.
&quot;In some ways, he was never really a young boy, you know,&quot; said Roger Hill, who became Welles&#x27;s teacher and lifelong friend.

Welles briefly attended public school in Madison, Wisconsin, enrolled in the fourth grade. On September 15, 1926, he entered the Todd Seminary for Boys, an expensive independent school in Woodstock, Illinois, that his older brother, Richard Ives Welles, had attended ten years before until he was expelled for misbehavior. At Todd School, Welles came under the influence of Roger Hill, a teacher who was later Todd&#x27;s headmaster. Hill provided Welles with an &quot;ad hoc&quot; educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him. Welles performed and staged theatrical experiments and productions there.

&quot;Todd provided Welles with many valuable experiences,&quot; wrote critic Richard France. &quot;He was able to explore and experiment in an atmosphere of acceptance and encouragement. In addition to a theatre, the school&#x27;s own radio station was at his disposal.&quot; Welles&#x27;s first radio experience was on the Todd station, where he performed an adaptation of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; that was written by him.

On December 28, 1930, when Welles was 15, his father died of heart and kidney failure at the age of 58, alone in a hotel in Chicago. Shortly before this, Welles had told his father that he refused to see him until he stopped drinking. Welles suffered lifelong guilt and despair that he was unable to express. &quot;That was the last I ever saw of him,&quot; Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming 53 years later. &quot;I&#x27;ve never, never ... I don&#x27;t want to forgive myself.&quot; His father&#x27;s will left it to Welles to name his guardian. When Roger Hill declined, he chose Dr. Maurice Bernstein, a physician and friend of the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker/ageless-soul&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;umich.edu/never-before-seen&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Following graduation from Todd in May 1931, Welles was awarded a scholarship to Harvard College, while his mentor Roger Hill advocated he attend Cornell College in Iowa. Instead, Welles chose travel. He studied for a few weeks at the Art Institute of Chicago with Boris Anisfeld, who encouraged him to pursue painting.

Welles occasionally returned to Woodstock, the place he eventually named when he was asked in a 1960 interview, &quot;Where is home?&quot; Welles replied, &quot;I suppose it&#x27;s Woodstock, Illinois, if it&#x27;s anywhere. I went to school there for four years. If I try to think of a home, it&#x27;s that.&quot;

== Early career (1931–1935) ==

After his father&#x27;s death, Welles traveled to Europe using a small portion of his inheritance. Welles said that while on a walking and painting trip through Ireland, he strode into the Gate Theatre in Dublin and claimed he was a Broadway star. The manager of the Gate, Hilton Edwards, later said he had not believed him but was impressed by his brashness and an impassioned audition he gave. Welles made his stage debut at the Gate Theatre on October 13, 1931, appearing in Ashley Dukes&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Jud Süß&quot; as Duke Karl Alexander of Württemberg. He performed small supporting roles in subsequent Gate productions, and he produced and designed productions of his own in Dublin. In March 1932, Welles performed in W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Circle&quot; at Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre and traveled to London to find additional work in the theatre. Unable to obtain a work permit, he returned to the U.S.

Welles found his fame ephemeral and turned to a writing project at Todd School that became immensely successful, first entitled &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Shakespeare&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1080/17450910600983828&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oldfloridabookshop/11971&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for the first three volumes,&lt;ref name=&quot;lib.uiowa/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently, &quot;The Mercury Shakespeare&quot;. In Spring 1933, Welles traveled via the &quot;SS Exermont&quot;, a tramp steamer, writing the introduction for the books, while onboard ship. After landing at Morocco, he stayed as the guest of Thami El Glaoui, in the Atlas mountains surrounding Tangier, while working on thousands of illustrations for the &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Shakespeare&quot; series of educational books, a series that remained in print for decades.

In 1933, Hortense and Roger Hill invited Welles to a party in Chicago, where Welles met Thornton Wilder. Wilder arranged for Welles to meet Alexander Woollcott in New York in order that he be introduced to Katharine Cornell, who was assembling a theatre company for a seven-month transcontinental repertory tour. Cornell&#x27;s husband, director Guthrie McClintic, immediately put Welles under contract and cast him in three plays. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; and &quot;Candida&quot; began touring in repertory in November 1933, with the first of more than 200 performances taking place in Buffalo, New York.
In 1934, Welles got his first job on radio—with &quot;The American School of the Air&quot;—through actor-director Paul Stewart, who introduced him to director Knowles Entrikin. That summer, Welles staged a drama festival with the Todd School at the Opera House in Woodstock, Illinois, inviting Micheál Mac Liammóir and Hilton Edwards from Dublin&#x27;s Gate Theatre to appear along with New York stage luminaries in productions including &quot;Trilby&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Drunkard&quot; and &quot;Tsar Paul&quot;. At the old firehouse in Woodstock, he also shot his first film, an eight-minute short titled &quot;The Hearts of Age&quot;.

On November 14, 1934, Welles married Chicago socialite and actress Virginia Nicolson (often misspelled &quot;Nicholson&quot;) in a civil ceremony in New York. To appease the Nicolsons, who were furious at the couple&#x27;s elopement, a formal ceremony took place December 23, 1934, at the New Jersey mansion of the bride&#x27;s godmother. Welles wore a cutaway borrowed from his friend George Macready.

A revised production of Katharine Cornell&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; opened December 20, 1934, at the Martin Beck Theatre in New York. The Broadway production brought the 19-year-old Welles to the notice of John Houseman, a theatrical producer who was casting the lead role in the debut production of one of Archibald MacLeish&#x27;s verse plays, &quot;Panic&quot;. On March 22, 1935, Welles made his debut on the CBS Radio series &quot;The March of Time&quot;, performing a scene from &quot;Panic&quot; for a news report on the stage production.

By 1935, Welles was supplementing his earnings in the theatre as a radio actor in Manhattan, working with many actors who later formed the core of his Mercury Theatre on programs including &quot;America&#x27;s Hour&quot;, &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot;, &quot;Columbia Workshop&quot; and &quot;The March of Time&quot;. &quot;Within a year of his debut Welles could claim membership in that elite band of radio actors who commanded salaries second only to the highest paid movie stars,&quot; wrote critic Richard France.

== Theatre (1936–1938) ==
=== Federal Theatre Project ===

Part of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project (1935–1939) was a New Deal program to fund theatre and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the United States during the Great Depression. It was created as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors and theatre workers. Under national director Hallie Flanagan it was shaped into a truly national theatre that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and innovation, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time.

John Houseman, director of the Negro Theatre Unit in New York, invited Welles to join the Federal Theatre Project in 1935. Far from unemployed—&quot;I was so employed I forgot how to sleep&quot;—Welles put a large share of his $1,500-a-week radio earnings into his stage productions, bypassing administrative red tape and mounting the projects more quickly and professionally. &quot;Roosevelt once said that I was the only operator in history who ever illegally siphoned money &quot;into&quot; a Washington project,&quot; Welles said.

The Federal Theatre Project was the ideal environment in which Welles could develop his art. Its purpose was employment, so he was able to hire any number of artists, craftsmen and technicians, and he filled the stage with performers. The company for the first production, an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; with an entirely African-American cast, numbered 150. The production became known as the &quot;Voodoo Macbeth&quot; because Welles changed the setting to a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King Henri Christophe, with Haitian &quot;vodou&quot; fulfilling the role of Scottish witchcraft. The play opened April 14, 1936, at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem and was received rapturously. At 20, Welles was hailed as a prodigy. The production then made a 4,000-mile national tour that included two weeks at the Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas.
Next mounted was the farce &quot;Horse Eats Hat&quot;, an adaptation by Welles and Edwin Denby of &quot;The Italian Straw Hat&quot;, an 1851 five-act farce by Eugène Marin Labiche and Marc-Michel. The play was presented September 26 – December 5, 1936, at Maxine Elliott&#x27;s Theatre, New York, and featured Joseph Cotten in his first starring role. It was followed by an adaptation of &quot;Dr. Faustus&quot; that used light as a prime unifying scenic element in a nearly black stage, presented January 8 – May 9, 1937, at Maxine Elliott&#x27;s Theatre.

Outside the scope of the Federal Theatre Project, American composer Aaron Copland chose Welles to direct &quot;The Second Hurricane&quot; (1937), an operetta with a libretto by Edwin Denby. Presented at the Henry Street Settlement Music School in New York for the benefit of high school students, the production opened April 21, 1937, and ran its scheduled three performances.

In 1937, Welles rehearsed Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s political opera, &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;. It was originally scheduled to open June 16, 1937, in its first public preview. Because of cutbacks in the WPA projects, the show&#x27;s premiere at the Maxine Elliott Theatre was canceled. The theater was locked and guarded to prevent any government-purchased materials from being used for a commercial production of the work. In a last-minute move, Welles announced to waiting ticket-holders that the show was being transferred to the Venice, 20 blocks away. Some cast, and some crew and audience, walked the distance on foot. The union musicians refused to perform in a commercial theater for lower non-union government wages. The actors&#x27; union stated that the production belonged to the Federal Theatre Project and could not be performed outside that context without permission. Lacking the participation of the union members, &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; began with Blitzstein introducing the show and playing the piano accompaniment on stage with some cast members performing from the audience. This impromptu performance was well received by its audience.

=== Mercury Theatre ===


Breaking with the Federal Theatre Project in 1937, Welles and Houseman founded their own repertory company, which they called the Mercury Theatre. The name was inspired by the title of the iconoclastic magazine &quot;The American Mercury&quot;. Welles was executive producer, and the original company included such actors as Joseph Cotten, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Arlene Francis, Martin Gabel, John Hoyt, Norman Lloyd, Vincent Price, Stefan Schnabel and Hiram Sherman.

&quot;I think he was the greatest directorial talent we&#x27;ve ever had in the [American] theater&quot;, Lloyd said of Welles in a 2014 interview. &quot;When you saw a Welles production, you saw the text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of everything. We had not had such a man in our theater. He was the first and remains the greatest.&quot;

The Mercury Theatre opened November 11, 1937, with &quot;Caesar&quot;, Welles&#x27;s modern-dress adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;—streamlined into an anti-fascist tour de force that Joseph Cotten later described as &quot;so vigorous, so contemporary that it set Broadway on its ear&quot;. The set was completely open with no curtain, and the brick stage wall was painted dark red. Scene changes were achieved by lighting alone. On the stage was a series of risers; squares were cut into one at intervals and lights, designed by Jean Rosenthal, were set beneath it, pointing straight up to evoke the &quot;cathedral of light&quot; at the Nuremberg Rallies. &quot;He staged it like a political melodrama that happened the night before,&quot; said Lloyd.

Beginning January 1, 1938, &quot;Caesar&quot; was performed in repertory with &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot;; both productions moved to the larger National Theatre. They were followed by &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; (April 29, 1938) and &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot; (November 5, 1938). As well as being presented in a pared-down oratorio version at the Mercury Theatre on Sunday nights in December 1937, &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; was at the Windsor Theatre for 13 weeks (January 4 – April 2, 1938). Such was the success of the Mercury Theatre that Welles appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in full makeup as Captain Shotover in &quot;Heartbreak House&quot;, in the issue dated May 9, 1938—three days after his 23rd birthday.

== Radio (1936–1940) ==

Simultaneously with his work in the theatre, Welles worked extensively in radio as an actor, writer, director, and producer, often without credit. Between 1935 and 1937 he was earning as much as $2,000 a week, shuttling between radio studios at such a pace that he would arrive barely in time for a quick scan of his lines before he was on the air. While he was directing the &quot;Voodoo Macbeth&quot; Welles was dashing between Harlem and midtown Manhattan three times a day to meet his radio commitments.
In addition to continuing as a repertory player on &quot;The March of Time&quot;, in the fall of 1936 Welles adapted and performed &quot;Hamlet&quot; in an early two-part episode of CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;Columbia Workshop&quot;. His performance as the announcer in the series&#x27; April 1937 presentation of Archibald MacLeish&#x27;s verse drama &quot;The Fall of the City&quot; was an important development in his radio career and made the 21-year-old Welles an overnight star.

In July 1937, the Mutual Network gave Welles a seven-week series to adapt &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. It was his first job as a writer-director for radio, the debut of the Mercury Theatre, and one of Welles&#x27;s earliest and finest achievements. He invented the use of narration in radio.

&quot;By making himself the center of the storytelling process, Welles fostered the impression of self-adulation that was to haunt his career to his dying day&quot;, wrote critic Andrew Sarris. &quot;For the most part, however, Welles was singularly generous to the other members of his cast and inspired loyalty from them above and beyond the call of professionalism.&quot;

That September, Mutual chose Welles to play Lamont Cranston, also known as The Shadow. He performed the role through mid-September 1938.

=== &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; ===
After the theatrical successes of the Mercury Theatre, CBS Radio invited Orson Welles to create a summer show for 13 weeks. The series began July 11, 1938, with the formula that Welles would play the lead in each show. . The weekly hour-long show presented radio plays based on classic literary works, with original music composed and conducted by Bernard Herrmann.

The Mercury Theatre&#x27;s radio adaptation of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; by H. G. Wells October 30, 1938, brought Welles instant fame. The combination of the news bulletin form of the performance with the between-breaks dial-spinning habits of listeners was later reported to have created widespread confusion among listeners who failed to hear the introduction, although the extent of this confusion has come into question. Panic was reportedly spread among listeners who believed the fictional news reports of a Martian invasion. The myth of the result created by the combination was reported as fact around the world and disparagingly mentioned by Adolf Hitler in a public speech.

Welles&#x27;s growing fame drew Hollywood offers, lures that the independent-minded Welles resisted at first. &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;, which had been a sustaining show (without sponsorship), was picked up by Campbell Soup and renamed &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;. &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; made its last broadcast on December 4, 1938, and &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; began five days later.

Welles began commuting from California to New York for the two Sunday broadcasts of &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; after signing a film contract with RKO Pictures in August 1939. In November 1939, production of the show moved from New York to Los Angeles.

After 20 shows, Campbell began to exercise more creative control and had complete control over story selection. As his contract with Campbell came to an end, Welles chose not to sign on for another season. After the broadcast of March 31, 1940, Welles and Campbell parted amicably.

== Hollywood (1939–1948) ==

RKO Radio Pictures president George J. Schaefer eventually offered Welles what generally is considered the greatest contract offered to a filmmaker, much less to one who was untried. Engaging him to write, produce, direct and perform in two motion pictures, the contract subordinated the studio&#x27;s financial interests to Welles&#x27;s creative control, and broke all precedent by granting Welles the right of final cut. After signing a summary agreement with RKO on July 22, Welles signed a full-length 63-page contract August 21, 1939. The agreement was bitterly resented by the Hollywood studios and persistently mocked in the trade press.

=== &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; ===

RKO rejected Welles&#x27;s first two movie proposals, but agreed on the third offer—&quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Welles co-wrote, produced, directed and starred in the film. Welles conceived the project with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who was writing radio plays for &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;. Mankiewicz based the original outline of the film script on the life of William Randolph Hearst, whom he knew and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst&#x27;s circle.

After agreeing on the storyline and character, Welles supplied Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes and put him under contract to write the first-draft screenplay under the supervision of John Houseman. Welles wrote his own draft, then drastically condensed and rearranged both versions and added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz&#x27;s contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, &quot;At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank&#x27;s and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own.&quot; 

For the cast, Welles primarily used actors from his Mercury Theatre, including William Alland, Ray Collins, Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Erskine Sanford, Everett Sloane and Paul Stewart in their film debuts. Welles&#x27;s project attracted some of Hollywood&#x27;s best technicians, including cinematographer Gregg Toland. Welles and Toland made extensive use of deep focus photography, in which everything in the frame is in focus. Toland explained that he and Welles thought “that if it was possible, the picture should be brought to the screen in such a way that the audience would feel it was looking at reality, rather than merely at a movie.” They composed “our angles and compositions so that action which ordinarily would be shown in direct cuts would be shown in a single, longer scene--often one in which important action might take place simultaneously in widely separated points in extreme foreground and background.” 

Toland explained their use of deep (or pan) focus: Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.

Welles called Toland &quot;the greatest gift any director—young or old—could ever, ever have. And he never tried to impress on us that he was performing miracles. He just went ahead and performed them. I was calling on him to do things only a beginner could be ignorant enough to think anybody could ever do, and there he was, &quot;doing&quot; them.&quot; When asked why he and Toland used depth of focus, Welles explained: &quot;Well, in life you see everything in focus at the same time, so why not in the movies?&quot;

It was the first film scored by Bernard Herrmann, who had worked with Welles in radio. Herrmann drew on radio techniques for his score: The movies frequently overlook opportunities for musical cues that last only a few seconds—that is, from five to fifteen seconds at the most—the reason being that the eye usually covers this transition. On the other hand, in radio drama, every scene must be bridged by some sort of sound device, so that even five seconds of music becomes a vital instrument in telling the ear the scene is shifting. I felt that in this film, where photographic contrasts were often so sharp and sudden, a brief cue—even two or three chords—might heighten the effect immeasurably ... Sound effects were often blended in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, with the music, to add intensity to certain scenes. This was also a carry-over from radio technique. 

Herrmann concluded that &quot;two full weeks were spent in the dubbing room, and music under our supervision was often re-recorded six or seven times before the proper dynamic level was achieved. The result is an exact projection of the original musical ideas in the score. Technically, no composer could ask for more.&quot; Filming &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; took ten weeks.

Hearst&#x27;s newspapers barred all reference to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and exerted enormous pressure on the Hollywood film community to force RKO to shelve the film. RKO chief George J. Schaefer received a cash offer from MGM&#x27;s Louis B. Mayer and other major studio executives if he would destroy the negative and existing prints of the film.

While waiting for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; to be released, Welles produced and directed the original Broadway production of &quot;Native Son&quot;, a drama written by Paul Green and Richard Wright based on Wright&#x27;s novel. Starring Canada Lee, the show ran March 24 – June 28, 1941, at the St. James Theatre. The Mercury Production was the last time Welles and Houseman worked together.

Although &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was given a limited release, the film received overwhelming critical praise. It was voted the best picture of 1941 by the National Board of Review and the New York Film Critics Circle. The film garnered nine Academy Award nominations but won only Best Original Screenplay, shared by Mankiewicz and Welles. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that block voting by screen extras deprived &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were likely to have been responsible for the film receiving no technical awards. Bosley Crowther wrote that Welles &quot;has made a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts. Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.&quot; Cecelia Ager, in &quot;PM Magazine&quot;, wrote: “Before &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, it&#x27;s as if the motion picture were a slumbering monster, a mighty force stupidly sleeping, lying there…awaiting a fierce young man to come kick it to life, to rouse it, shake it, awaken it to its potentialities ... Seeing it, it&#x27;s as if you never really saw a movie before.”

The delay in the film&#x27;s release and uneven distribution contributed to mediocre results at the box office. After it ran its course theatrically, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was retired to the vault in 1942. In postwar France, however, the film&#x27;s reputation grew after it was seen there for the first time in 1946. In the United States, it began to be re-evaluated after it appeared on television in 1956. That year it was also re-released theatrically, and film critic Andrew Sarris described it as &quot;the great American film&quot; and &quot;the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;.&quot; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is now widely hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. From 1962 to 2012, it topped the decennial &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; poll of the Greatest Films of All Time.

=== &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; ===
&quot;The fate of &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; is one of film history&#x27;s great tragedies,&quot; wrote film historian Robert L. Carringer. It was Welles&#x27;s second film for RKO, adapted by Welles from Booth Tarkington&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning 1918 novel about the declining fortunes of a wealthy Midwestern family and the social changes brought by the automobile age. Toland was unavailable, so Stanley Cortez was named cinematographer. The meticulous Cortez worked slowly and the film lagged behind schedule and over budget. In contract renegotiations with RKO over a film he was obliged to direct, Welles had conceded his right to control the final cut.
&quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; was in production October 28, 1941, to January 22, 1942, with a cast including Joseph Cotten, Dolores Costello, Anne Baxter, Tim Holt, Agnes Moorehead and Ray Collins. RKO chief George Schaefer understood that presenting a downbeat period film without marquee stars was a risk for the studio, but he was reassured by a special screening of the film-in-progress that Welles arranged for him on November 28. Schaefer was an expert in film distribution, and attended to the marketing strategy personally.

Required to start filming the &quot;Carnaval&quot; segment of &quot;It’s All True&quot; in early February 1942, Welles rushed to edit &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; and finish his acting scenes in &quot;Journey into Fear&quot;. He ended his lucrative CBS radio show February 2, flew to Washington, D.C., for a briefing, and then lashed together a rough cut of &quot;Ambersons&quot; in Miami with editor Robert Wise.

A finished 131-minute version of the movie, edited per Welles&#x27;s detailed instructions, was previewed March 17, 1942, in Pomona. Schaefer was present, and he was rattled by the audience response: 75 percent of the preview cards were negative. The film was received more favorably by a preview audience in the more upscale Pasadena on March 19, with only 25 percent of the preview cards negative. But the experience led Schaefer to authorize the studio to make whatever changes necessary to make &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; a commercial success.

Wise, whom Welles had left in charge of postproduction, removed nearly 50 minutes of footage from Welles&#x27;s cut, and several scenes — including the ending — were rewritten and reshot. Over Welles&#x27;s opposition, &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; was cut to run 88 minutes. Like the film itself, Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack and replaced by music by Roy Webb, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.

Even in its released form, &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; is considered one of the best films of all time. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and it was added to the National Film Registry in 1991.

=== &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; ===

At RKO&#x27;s request, Welles worked on an adaptation of Eric Ambler&#x27;s spy thriller &quot;Journey into Fear&quot;, co-written with Joseph Cotten. In addition to acting in the film, Welles was the producer. Direction was credited to Norman Foster. Welles later said that they were in such a rush that the director of each scene was determined by whoever was closest to the camera. &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; was in production January 6 – March 12, 1942.

=== War work ===

==== Goodwill ambassador ====

In late November 1941, Welles was appointed as a goodwill ambassador to Latin America by Nelson Rockefeller, U.S. Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and a principal stockholder in RKO Radio Pictures. The mission of the OCIAA was cultural diplomacy, promoting hemispheric solidarity and countering the growing influence of the Axis powers in Latin America. John Hay Whitney, head of the agency&#x27;s Motion Picture Division, was asked by the Brazilian government to produce a documentary of the annual Rio Carnival celebration taking place in early February 1942. In a telegram on December 20, 1941, Whitney wrote Welles, &quot;Personally believe you would make great contribution to hemisphere solidarity with this project.&quot;

The OCIAA sponsored cultural tours to Latin America and appointed goodwill ambassadors including George Balanchine and the American Ballet, Bing Crosby, Aaron Copland, Walt Disney, John Ford and Rita Hayworth. Welles was thoroughly briefed in Washington, D.C., immediately before his departure for Brazil, and film scholar Catherine L. Benamou, a specialist in Latin American affairs, finds it &quot;not unlikely&quot; that he was among the goodwill ambassadors who were asked to gather intelligence for the U.S. government in addition to their cultural duties. She concludes that Welles&#x27;s acceptance of Whitney&#x27;s request was &quot;a logical and patently patriotic choice&quot;.

In addition to working on his ill-fated film &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot;, Welles was responsible for radio programs, lectures, interviews and informal talks as part of his OCIAA-sponsored cultural mission, which was regarded as a success. He spoke on topics ranging from Shakespeare to visual art at gatherings of Brazil&#x27;s elite, and his two intercontinental radio broadcasts in April 1942 were particularly intended to tell U.S. audiences that President Vargas was a partner with the Allies. Welles&#x27;s ambassadorial mission was extended to permit his travel to other nations including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. Welles worked for more than half a year with no compensation.

Welles&#x27;s own expectations for the film were modest. &quot;&quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; was not going to make any cinematic history, nor was it intended to,&quot; he later said. &quot;It was intended to be a perfectly honorable execution of my job as a goodwill ambassador, bringing entertainment to the Northern Hemisphere that showed them something about the Southern one.&quot;

==== &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; ====


In July 1941, Welles conceived &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; as an omnibus film mixing documentary and docufiction in a project that emphasized the dignity of labor and celebrated the cultural and ethnic diversity of North America. It was to have been his third film for RKO, following &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942). Duke Ellington was put under contract to score a segment with the working title, &quot;The Story of Jazz&quot;, drawn from Louis Armstrong&#x27;s 1936 autobiography, &quot;Swing That Music&quot;. Armstrong was cast to play himself in the brief dramatization of the history of jazz performance, from its roots to its place in American culture in the 1940s. &quot;The Story of Jazz&quot; was to go into production in December 1941.

Mercury Productions purchased the stories for two other segments—&quot;My Friend Bonito&quot; and &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Chair&quot;—from documentary filmmaker Robert J. Flaherty. Adapted by Norman Foster and John Fante, &quot;My Friend Bonito&quot; was the only segment of the original &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; to go into production. Filming took place in Mexico September–December 1941, with Norman Foster directing under Welles&#x27;s supervision.

In December 1941, the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs asked Welles to make a film in Brazil that would showcase the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. With filming of &quot;My Friend Bonito&quot; about two-thirds complete, Welles decided he could shift the geography of &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; and incorporate Flaherty&#x27;s story into an omnibus film about Latin America—supporting the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s Good Neighbor policy, which Welles strongly advocated. In this revised concept, &quot;The Story of Jazz&quot; was replaced by the story of samba, a musical form with a comparable history and one that came to fascinate Welles. He also decided to do a ripped-from-the-headlines episode about the epic voyage of four poor Brazilian fishermen, the jangadeiros, who had become national heroes. Welles later said this was the most valuable story.

Required to film the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro in early February 1942, Welles rushed to edit &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; and finish his acting scenes in &quot;Journey into Fear&quot;. He ended his lucrative CBS radio show February 2, flew to Washington, D.C., for a briefing, and then lashed together a rough cut of &quot;Ambersons&quot; in Miami with editor Robert Wise. Welles recorded the film&#x27;s narration the night before he left for South America: &quot;I went to the projection room at about four in the morning, did the whole thing, and then got on the plane and off to Rio—and the end of civilization as we know it.&quot;

Welles left for Brazil on February 4 and began filming in Rio on February 8, 1942. At the time it did not seem that Welles&#x27;s other film projects would be disrupted, but as film historian Catherine L. Benamou wrote, &quot;the ambassadorial appointment would be the first in a series of turning points leading—in &#x27;zigs&#x27; and &#x27;zags,&#x27; rather than in a straight line—to Welles&#x27;s loss of complete directorial control over both &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot;, the cancellation of his contract at RKO Radio Studio, the expulsion of his company Mercury Productions from the RKO lot, and, ultimately, the total suspension of &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot;.&quot;

In 1942 RKO Pictures underwent major changes under new management. Nelson Rockefeller, the primary backer of the Brazil project, left its board of directors, and Welles&#x27;s principal sponsor at RKO, studio president George Schaefer, resigned. RKO took control of &quot;Ambersons&quot; and edited the film into what the studio considered a commercial format. Welles&#x27;s attempts to protect his version ultimately failed. In South America, Welles requested resources to finish &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot;. Given a limited amount of black-and-white film stock and a silent camera, he was able to finish shooting the episode about the jangadeiros, but RKO refused to support further production on the film.

&quot;So I was fired from RKO,&quot; Welles later recalled. &quot;And they made a great publicity point of the fact that I had gone to South America without a script and thrown all this money away. I never recovered from that attack.&quot; Later in 1942, when RKO Pictures began promoting its new corporate motto, &quot;Showmanship In Place of Genius: A New Deal at RKO&quot;, Welles understood it as a reference to him.

==== Radio (1942–1943) ====
Welles returned to the United States August 22, 1942, after more than six months in South America. A week after his return he produced and emceed the first two hours of a seven-hour coast-to-coast War Bond drive broadcast titled &quot;I Pledge America&quot;. Airing August 29, 1942, on the Blue Network, the program was presented in cooperation with the United States Department of the Treasury, Western Union (which wired bond subscriptions free of charge) and the American Women&#x27;s Voluntary Services. Featuring 21 dance bands and a score of stage and screen and radio stars, the broadcast raised more than $10 million—more than $146 million today—for the war effort.

On October 12, 1942, &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot; presented Welles&#x27;s radio play, &quot;Admiral of the Ocean Sea&quot;, an entertaining and factual look at the legend of Christopher Columbus.

&quot;It belongs to a period when hemispheric unity was a crucial matter and many programs were being devoted to the common heritage of the Americas,&quot; wrote broadcasting historian Erik Barnouw. &quot;Many such programs were being translated into Spanish and Portuguese and broadcast to Latin America, to counteract many years of successful Axis propaganda to that area. The Axis, trying to stir Latin America against Anglo-America, had constantly emphasized the differences between the two. It became the job of American radio to emphasize their common experience and essential unity.&quot;

&quot;Admiral of the Ocean Sea&quot;, also known as &quot;Columbus Day&quot;, begins with the words, &quot;Hello Americans&quot;—the title Welles would choose for his own series five weeks later.
&quot;Hello Americans&quot;, a CBS Radio series broadcast November 15, 1942 – January 31, 1943, was produced, directed and hosted by Welles under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator for Inter-American Affairs. The 30-minute weekly program promoted inter-American understanding and friendship, drawing upon the research amassed for the ill-fated film, &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot;. The series was produced concurrently with Welles&#x27;s other CBS series, &quot;Ceiling Unlimited&quot; (November 9, 1942 – February 1, 1943), sponsored by the Lockheed-Vega Corporation. The program was conceived to glorify the aviation industry and dramatize its role in World War II. Welles&#x27;s shows were regarded as significant contributions to the war effort.
Throughout the war Welles worked on patriotic radio programs including &quot;Command Performance&quot;, &quot;G.I. Journal&quot;, &quot;Mail Call&quot;, &quot;Nazi Eyes on Canada&quot;, &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; and &quot;Treasury Star Parade&quot;.

==== &quot;The Mercury Wonder Show&quot; ====

In early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (&quot;Ceiling Unlimited&quot;, &quot;Hello Americans&quot;) that Orson Welles created for CBS to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on the 1943 film adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part circus and part magic show. He offered his services as magician and director, and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he co-produced with his friend Joseph Cotten: &quot;The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men&quot;. Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay. The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.

The development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles&#x27;s oft-changing draft status in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F—unfit for military service—for a variety of medical reasons. &quot;I felt guilty about the war,&quot; Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. &quot;I was guilt-ridden about my civilian status.&quot; He had been publicly hounded about his patriotism since &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, when the Hearst press began persistent inquiries about why Welles had not been drafted.

&quot;The Mercury Wonder Show&quot; ran August 3 – September 9, 1943, in an 80-by-120-foot tent located at 900 Cahuenga Boulevard, in the heart of Hollywood. At intermission on September 7, 1943, KMPC radio interviewed audience and cast members of &quot;The Mercury Wonder Show&quot;—including Welles and Rita Hayworth, who were married earlier that day. Welles remarked that &quot;The Mercury Wonder Show&quot; had been performed for approximately 48,000 members of the U.S. armed forces.

==== Radio (1944–1945) ====
The idea of doing a radio variety show occurred to Welles after his success as substitute host of four consecutive episodes (March 14 – April 4, 1943) of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, radio&#x27;s most popular show, when Benny contracted pneumonia on a performance tour of military bases. A half-hour variety show broadcast January 26 – July 19, 1944, on the Columbia Pacific Network, &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot; presented sketch comedy, magic, mindreading, music and readings from classic works. Many of the shows originated on U.S. military camps, where Welles and his repertory company and guests entertained the troops with a reduced version of &quot;The Mercury Wonder Show&quot;. The performances of the all-star jazz group Welles brought together for the show were so popular that the band became a regular feature and was an important force in reviving interest in traditional New Orleans jazz.

Welles was placed on the U.S. Treasury payroll on May 15, 1944, as an expert consultant for the duration of the war, with a retainer of $1 a year. On the recommendation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau asked Welles to lead the Fifth War Loan Drive, which opened June 12 with a one-hour radio show on all four networks, broadcast from Texarkana, Texas. Including a statement by the President, the program defined the causes of the war and encouraged Americans to buy $16 billion in bonds to finance the Normandy landings and the most violent phase of World War II. Welles produced additional war loan drive broadcasts on June 14 from the Hollywood Bowl, and June 16 from Soldier Field, Chicago. Americans purchased $20.6 billion in War Bonds during the Fifth War Loan Drive, which ended on July 8, 1944.
Welles campaigned ardently for Roosevelt in 1944. A longtime supporter and campaign speaker for FDR, he occasionally sent the president ideas and phrases that were sometimes incorporated into what Welles characterized as &quot;less important speeches&quot;. One of these ideas was the joke in what came to be called the Fala speech, Roosevelt&#x27;s nationally broadcast September 23 address to the International Teamsters Union which opened the 1944 presidential campaign.

Welles campaigned for the Roosevelt–Truman ticket almost full-time in the fall of 1944, traveling to nearly every state to the detriment of his own health and at his own expense. In addition to his radio addresses he filled in for Roosevelt, opposite Republican presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey, at &quot;The New York Herald Tribune Forum&quot; broadcast October 18 on the Blue Network. Welles accompanied FDR to his last campaign rally, speaking at an event November 4 at Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park before 40,000 people, and took part in a historic election-eve campaign broadcast November 6 on all four radio networks.

On November 21, 1944, Welles began his association with &quot;This Is My Best&quot;, a CBS radio series he would briefly produce, direct, write and host (March 13 – April 24, 1945). He wrote a political column called &quot;Orson Welles&#x27; Almanac&quot; (later titled &quot;Orson Welles Today&quot;) for &quot;The New York Post&quot; January–November 1945, and advocated the continuation of FDR&#x27;s New Deal policies and his international vision, particularly the establishment of the United Nations and the cause of world peace.

On April 12, 1945, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt died, the Blue-ABC network marshalled its entire executive staff and national leaders to pay homage to the late president. &quot;Among the outstanding programs which attracted wide attention was a special tribute delivered by Orson Welles&quot;, reported &quot;Broadcasting&quot; magazine. Welles spoke at 10:10 p.m Eastern War Time, from Hollywood, and stressed the importance of continuing FDR&#x27;s work: &quot;He has no need for homage and we who loved him have no time for tears ... Our fighting sons and brothers cannot pause tonight to mark the death of him whose name will be given to the age we live in.&quot;

Welles presented another special broadcast on the death of Roosevelt the following evening: &quot;We must move on beyond mere death to that free world which was the hope and labor of his life.&quot;

He dedicated the April 17 episode of &quot;This Is My Best&quot; to Roosevelt and the future of America on the eve of the United Nations Conference on International Organization. Welles was an advisor and correspondent for the Blue-ABC radio network&#x27;s coverage of the San Francisco conference that formed the UN, taking place April 24 – June 23, 1945. He presented a half-hour dramatic program written by Ben Hecht on the opening day of the conference, and on Sunday afternoons (April 29 – June 10) he led a weekly discussion from the San Francisco Civic Auditorium.

=== &quot;The Stranger&quot; ===


In the fall of 1945 Welles began work on &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1946), a film noir drama about a war crimes investigator who tracks a high-ranking Nazi fugitive to an idyllic New England town. Edward G. Robinson, Loretta Young and Welles star.

Producer Sam Spiegel initially planned to hire director John Huston, who had rewritten the screenplay by Anthony Veiller. When Huston entered the military, Welles was given the chance to direct and prove himself able to make a film on schedule and under budget—something he was so eager to do that he accepted a disadvantageous contract. One of its concessions was that he would defer to the studio in any creative dispute.

&quot;The Stranger&quot; was Welles&#x27;s first job as a film director in four years. He was told that if the film was successful he could sign a four-picture deal with International Pictures, making films of his own choosing. Welles was given some degree of creative control, and he endeavored to personalize the film and develop a nightmarish tone. He worked on the general rewrite of the script and wrote scenes at the beginning of the picture that were shot but subsequently cut by the producers. He filmed in long takes that largely thwarted the control given to editor Ernest J. Nims under the terms of the contract.

&quot;The Stranger&quot; was the first commercial film to use documentary footage from the Nazi concentration camps. Welles had seen the footage in early May 1945 in San Francisco, as a correspondent and discussion moderator at the UN Conference on International Organization. He wrote of the Holocaust footage in his syndicated &quot;New York Post&quot; column May 7, 1945.

Completed a day ahead of schedule and under budget, &quot;The Stranger&quot; was the only film made by Welles to have been a &quot;bona fide&quot; box office success upon its release. Its cost was $1.034 million; 15 months after its release it had grossed $3.216 million. Within weeks of the completion of the film, International Pictures backed out of its promised four-picture deal with Welles. No reason was given, but the impression was left that &quot;The Stranger&quot; would not make money.

=== &quot;Around the World&quot; ===
In the summer of 1946, Welles moved to New York to direct the Broadway musical &quot;Around the World&quot;, a stage adaptation of Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; with a book by Welles and music by Cole Porter. Producer Mike Todd, who would later produce the successful 1956 film adaptation, pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, leaving Welles to support the finances. When Welles ran out of money he convinced Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn to send enough money to continue the show, and in exchange Welles promised to write, produce, direct and star in a film for Cohn for no further fee. The stage show soon failed due to poor box-office, with Welles unable to claim the losses on his taxes. Inspired by magician and cinema pioneer Georges Méliès, the show required 55 stagehands and used films to bridge scenes. Welles said it was his favorite of his stage productions. Regarding its extravagance, critic Robert Garland said it had &quot;everything but the kitchen sink.&quot; The next night, Welles brought out a kitchen sink.

=== Radio (1946) ===

In 1946, Welles began two new radio series—&quot;The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air&quot; for CBS, and &quot;Orson Welles Commentaries&quot; for ABC. While &quot;Mercury Summer Theatre&quot; featured half-hour adaptations of some classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s, the first episode was a condensation of his &quot;Around the World&quot; stage play, and is the only record of Cole Porter&#x27;s music for the project. Several original Mercury actors returned for the series, as well as Bernard Herrmann. Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play. &quot;Commentaries&quot; was a political vehicle for him, continuing the themes from his &quot;New York Post&quot; column. Again, Welles lacked a clear focus, until the NAACP brought to his attention the case of Isaac Woodard. Welles brought significant attention to Woodard&#x27;s cause.

The last broadcast of &quot;Orson Welles Commentaries&quot; on October 6, 1946, marked the end of Welles&#x27;s own radio shows.

=== &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot; ===


The film that Welles was obliged to make in exchange for Harry Cohn&#x27;s help in financing the stage production &quot;Around the World&quot; was &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot;, filmed in 1947 for Columbia Pictures. Welles intended it to be a modest thriller, but the budget skyrocketed after Cohn suggested that Welles&#x27;s then-estranged wife Rita Hayworth star.

Cohn disliked Welles&#x27;s rough cut, particularly the confusing plot and lack of close-ups, and was not in sympathy with Welles&#x27;s Brechtian use of irony and black comedy, especially in a farcical courtroom scene. Cohn ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles&#x27;s first cut was removed, including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was particularly appalled with the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors (the use of mirrors being a recurrent motif of Welles&#x27;s, starting with &quot;Kane&quot;) has since become a touchstone of film noir. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce.

Although &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot; was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced until decades later in the U.S., where it is now often regarded as a classic of film noir.

=== &quot;Macbeth&quot; ===
Prior to 1948, Welles convinced Republic Pictures to let him direct a low-budget version of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, featuring highly stylized sets and costumes, and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a pre-recorded soundtrack, one of many innovative cost-cutting techniques Welles deployed in an attempt to make an epic film from B-movie resources. The script, adapted by Welles, is a violent reworking of Shakespeare&#x27;s original, freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a collage technique and recasting &quot;Macbeth&quot; as a clash of pagan and proto-Christian ideologies. Some voodoo trappings of the famous Welles/Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are visible, especially in the film&#x27;s characterization of the Weird Sisters, who create an effigy of Macbeth as a charm to enchant him. Of all Welles&#x27;s post-&quot;Kane&quot; Hollywood productions, &quot;Macbeth&quot; is stylistically closest to &quot;Kane&quot; in its long takes and deep focus photography.

Republic initially trumpeted the film as an important work but decided it did not care for the Scottish accents and held up general release for almost a year after early negative press reaction, including &quot;Life&quot;″s comment that Welles&#x27;s film &quot;doth foully slaughter Shakespeare.&quot; Welles left for Europe, while co-producer and lifelong supporter Richard Wilson reworked the soundtrack. Welles returned and cut 20 minutes from the film at Republic&#x27;s request and recorded narration to cover some gaps. The film was decried as a disaster. &quot;Macbeth&quot; had influential fans in Europe, especially the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, who hailed the film&#x27;s &quot;crude, irreverent power&quot; and careful shot design, and described the characters as haunting &quot;the corridors of some dreamlike subway, an abandoned coal mine, and ruined cellars oozing with water.&quot;

== Europe (1948–1956) ==

In Italy he starred as Cagliostro in the 1949 film &quot;Black Magic&quot;. His co-star, Akim Tamiroff, impressed Welles so much that Tamiroff would appear in four of Welles&#x27;s productions during the 1950s and 1960s.

The following year, Welles starred as Harry Lime in Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;The Third Man&quot;, alongside Joseph Cotten, his friend and co-star from &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, with a script by Graham Greene and a memorable score by Anton Karas. In it, Welles makes what Roger Ebert called &quot;the most famous entrance in the movies, and one of the most famous speeches.&quot; Greene credited the speech to Welles.

A few years later, British radio producer Harry Alan Towers would resurrect Lime in the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Harry Lime&quot;.

Welles appeared as Cesare Borgia in the 1949 Italian film &quot;Prince of Foxes&quot;, with Tyrone Power and Mercury Theatre alumnus Everett Sloane, and as the Mongol warrior Bayan in the 1950 film version of the novel &quot;The Black Rose&quot; (again with Tyrone Power).
=== &quot;Othello&quot; ===


During this time, Welles was channeling his money from acting jobs into a self-financed film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;. From 1949 to 1951, Welles worked on &quot;Othello&quot;, filming on location in Italy and Morocco. The film featured Welles&#x27;s friends Micheál Mac Liammóir as Iago and Hilton Edwards as Desdemona&#x27;s father Brabantio. Suzanne Cloutier starred as Desdemona and Campbell Playhouse alumnus Robert Coote appeared as Iago&#x27;s associate Roderigo.

Filming was suspended several times as Welles ran out of funds and left for acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiammóir&#x27;s memoir &quot;Put Money in Thy Purse&quot;. The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a dropout of sound at every quiet moment. Welles&#x27;s daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith, restored &quot;Othello&quot; in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing Angelo Francesco Lavagnino&#x27;s original musical score, which was originally inaudible, and adding ambient stereo sound effects, which were not in the original film. The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America. David Thomson writes of Welles&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;the poetry hangs in the air, like sea mist or incense.&quot; Anthony Lane writes that &quot;Some of the action was shot in Venice, and I occasionally wonder what crept into the camera casing; the movie looks blackened and silvery, like an aged mirror, or as if the emulsion of the print were already poised to decay. You can&#x27;t tell what is or isn&#x27;t Shakespeare, where his influence begins and ends.&quot; The movie premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (precursor of the Palme d&#x27;or).

In 1952, Welles continued finding work in England after the success of the &quot;Harry Lime&quot; radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, &quot;The Black Museum&quot;, which ran for 52 weeks with Welles as host and narrator. Director Herbert Wilcox offered Welles the part of the victim in &quot;Trent&#x27;s Last Case&quot;, based on Edmund Clerihew Bentley&#x27;s novel. In 1953, the BBC hired Welles to read an hour of selections from Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Song of Myself&quot;. Towers hired Welles again, to play Professor Moriarty in the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson.

Welles briefly returned to America to make his first appearance on television, starring in the &quot;Omnibus&quot; presentation of &quot;King Lear&quot;, broadcast live on CBS October 18, 1953. Directed by Peter Brook, the production costarred Natasha Parry, Beatrice Straight and Arnold Moss.

In 1954, director George More O&#x27;Ferrall offered Welles the title role in the &#x27;Lord Mountdrago&#x27; segment of &quot;Three Cases of Murder&quot;, co-starring Alan Badel. Herbert Wilcox cast Welles as the antagonist in &quot;Trouble in the Glen&quot; opposite Margaret Lockwood, Forrest Tucker and Victor McLaglen. Old friend John Huston cast him as Father Mapple in his 1956 film adaptation of Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, starring Gregory Peck.

=== &quot;Mr. Arkadin&quot; ===

Welles&#x27;s next turn as director was the film &quot;Mr. Arkadin&quot; (1955), which was produced by his political mentor from the 1940s, Louis Dolivet. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars Robert Arden, who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles&#x27;s third wife, Paola Mori, whose voice was dubbed by actress Billie Whitelaw; and guest stars Akim Tamiroff, Michael Redgrave, Katina Paxinou and Mischa Auer. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually, five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled &quot;Confidential Report&quot;. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the Munich Film Museum oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.

=== Television projects ===

In 1955, Welles also directed two television series for the BBC. The first was &quot;Orson Welles&#x27; Sketch Book&quot;, a series of six 15-minute shows featuring Welles drawing in a sketchbook to illustrate his reminiscences including such topics as the filming of &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; and the Isaac Woodard case. The second was &quot;Around the World with Orson Welles&quot;, a series of six travelogues set in different locations around Europe (such as Vienna, the Basque Country between France and Spain, and England). Welles served as host and interviewer, his commentary including documentary facts and his own personal observations (a technique he would continue to explore in later works).

During Episode 3 of &quot;Sketchbook&quot;, Welles makes a deliberate attack on the abuse of police powers around the world. The episode starts with him telling the story of Isaac Woodard, an African-American veteran of the South Pacific during World War II being falsely accused by a bus driver of being drunk and disorderly, who then has a policeman remove the man from the bus. Woodard is not arrested right away, but rather he is beaten into unconsciousness nearly to the point of death and when he finally regains consciousness he is permanently blinded. By the time doctors from the US Army located him three weeks later, there was nothing that could be done. Welles assures the audience that he personally saw to it that justice was served to this policeman although he doesn&#x27;t mention what type of justice was delivered. Welles then goes on to give other examples of police being given more power and authority than is necessary. The title of this episode is &quot;The Police&quot;.

In 1956, Welles completed &quot;Portrait of Gina&quot;. He left the only copy of it in his room at the Hôtel Ritz in Paris. The film cans would remain in a lost-and-found locker at the hotel for several decades, where they were discovered in 1986, after Welles&#x27;s death.

== Return to Hollywood (1956–1959) ==

In 1956, Welles returned to Hollywood. He began filming a projected pilot for Desilu, owned by Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz, who had recently purchased the former RKO studios. The film was &quot;The Fountain of Youth&quot;, based on a story by John Collier. Originally deemed not viable as a pilot, the film was not aired until 1958—and won the Peabody Award for excellence.

Welles guest starred on television shows including &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. On radio, he was narrator of &quot;Tomorrow&quot; (October 17, 1956), a nuclear holocaust drama produced and syndicated by ABC and the Federal Civil Defense Administration. Welles&#x27;s next feature film role was in &quot;Man in the Shadow&quot; for Universal Pictures in 1957, starring Jeff Chandler.

=== &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; ===

Welles stayed on at Universal to co-star with Charlton Heston in &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;, based on Whit Masterson&#x27;s novel &quot;Badge of Evil&quot;. Originally hired as an actor, Welles was promoted to director by Universal Studios at the insistence of Heston. The film reunited many actors and technicians with whom Welles had worked in Hollywood in the 1940s, including cameraman Russell Metty (&quot;The Stranger&quot;), makeup artist Maurice Seiderman (&quot;Citizen Kane&quot;), and actors Joseph Cotten, Marlene Dietrich and Akim Tamiroff. Filming proceeded smoothly, with Welles finishing on schedule and on budget, and the studio bosses praising the daily rushes. Nevertheless, after the end of production, the studio re-edited the film, re-shot scenes, and shot new exposition scenes to clarify the plot. Welles wrote a 58-page memo outlining suggestions and objections, stating that the film was no longer his version—it was the studio&#x27;s, but as such, he was still prepared to help with it. The movie was shown at the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair, where it won the grand prize. François Truffaut saw the film in Brussels, and it influenced his debut &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;, one of the seminal films of the French New Wave.

In 1978, a longer preview version of the film was discovered and released. In 1998, Walter Murch reedited the film according to Welles&#x27;s specifications in his memo. Murch said &quot;I&#x27;m just flabbergasted when I read his memos, thinking that he was writing these ideas forty years ago, because, if I was working on a film now and a director came up with ideas like these, I&#x27;d be amazed—pleased but amazed—to realize that someone was thinking that hard about sound—which is all too rare&quot;. The film was influential in its use of a handheld camera, notably in the scene in the elevator. Murch says that &quot;I&#x27;m sure Godard and Truffaut, who were big fans of &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;, learned from that scene how they could achieve exactly what they wanted—at once both a fresh sense of reality and ingenuity.&quot;

As Universal reworked &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;, Welles began filming his adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; in Mexico, starring Mischa Auer as Quixote and Akim Tamiroff as Sancho Panza.

== Return to Europe (1959–1970) ==
He continued shooting &quot;Don Quixote&quot; in Spain and Italy, but replaced Mischa Auer with Francisco Reiguera, and resumed acting jobs.
In Italy in 1959, Welles directed his own scenes as King Saul in Richard Pottier&#x27;s film &quot;David and Goliath&quot;. In Hong Kong, he co-starred with Curt Jürgens in Lewis Gilbert&#x27;s film &quot;Ferry to Hong Kong&quot;. In 1960, in Paris he co-starred in Richard Fleischer&#x27;s film &quot;Crack in the Mirror&quot;. In Yugoslavia he starred in Richard Thorpe&#x27;s film &quot;The Tartars&quot; and Veljko Bulajić&#x27;s &quot;Battle of Neretva&quot;.

Throughout the 1960s, filming continued on &quot;Quixote&quot; on-and-off until the end of the decade, as Welles evolved the concept, tone and ending several times. Although he had a complete version of the film shot and edited at least once, he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1980s; he never completed a version of the film he was fully satisfied with and would junk existing footage and shoot new footage. (In one case, he had a complete cut ready in which Quixote and Sancho Panza end up going to the Moon, but he felt the ending was rendered obsolete by the 1969 Moon landings and burned 10 reels of this version.) As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director Jesús Franco constructed a film out of the portions of &quot;Quixote&quot; left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.

In 1961, Welles directed &quot;In the Land of Don Quixote&quot;, a series of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network RAI. Similar to the &quot;Around the World with Orson Welles&quot; series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles&#x27;s wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network was not interested in him providing Italian narration because of his accent, and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.

=== &quot;The Trial&quot; ===
In 1962, Welles directed his adaptation of &quot;The Trial&quot;, based on the novel by Franz Kafka and produced by Michael and Alexander Salkind. The cast included Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Paola Mori, Akim Tamiroff and Anthony Perkins as Josef K. While filming exteriors in Zagreb, Welles was informed that the Salkinds had run out of money, meaning that there could be no set construction. No stranger to shooting on found locations, Welles soon filmed the interiors in the Gare d&#x27;Orsay, at that time an abandoned railway station in Paris. Welles thought the location possessed a &quot;Jules Verne modernism&quot; and a melancholy sense of &quot;waiting&quot;, both suitable for Kafka. To remain in the spirit of Kafka, Welles set up the cutting room together with the Film Editor, Frederick Muller (as Fritz Muller), in the old unused, cold, depressing, station master office. The film failed at the box-office. Peter Bogdanovich observed that Welles found the film riotously funny. Welles also told a BBC interviewer that it was his best film. While filming &quot;The Trial&quot; Welles met Oja Kodar, who later became his partner and collaborator for the last 20 years of his life.

Welles played a film director in &quot;La Ricotta&quot; (1963), Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s segment of the &quot;Ro.Go.Pa.G.&quot; movie, although his renowned voice was dubbed by Italian writer Giorgio Bassani. He continued taking what work he could find acting, narrating or hosting other people&#x27;s work, and began filming &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot;, which was completed in 1965.

=== &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; ===

Filmed in Spain, &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; was based on Welles&#x27;s play, &quot;Five Kings&quot;, in which he drew material from six Shakespeare plays to tell the story of Sir John Falstaff (Welles) and his relationship with Prince Hal (Keith Baxter). The cast includes John Gielgud, Jeanne Moreau, Fernando Rey and Margaret Rutherford; the film&#x27;s narration, spoken by Ralph Richardson, is taken from the chronicler Raphael Holinshed. Welles held the film in high regard: &quot;It&#x27;s my favorite picture, yes. If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that&#x27;s the one I would offer up.&quot; Anthony Lane writes that &quot;what Welles means to conjure up is not just historical continuity—the very best of Sir John—but a sense that the Complete Works of Shakespeare constitute, as it were, one vast poem, from which his devoted and audacious interpreters are free to quote... the picture both honors Shakespeare and spurns the industry, academic and theatrical, that has encrusted him over time.&quot;

In 1966, Welles directed a film for French television, an adaptation of &quot;The Immortal Story&quot;, by Karen Blixen. Released in 1968, it stars Jeanne Moreau, Roger Coggio and Norman Eshley. The film had a successful run in French theaters. At this time Welles met Oja Kodar again, and gave her a letter he had written to her and had been keeping for four years; they would not be parted again. They immediately began a collaboration both personal and professional. The first of these was an adaptation of Blixen&#x27;s &quot;The Heroine&quot;, meant to be a companion piece to &quot;The Immortal Story&quot; and starring Kodar. Unfortunately, funding disappeared after one day&#x27;s shooting. After completing this film, he appeared in a brief cameo as Cardinal Wolsey in Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;—a role for which he won considerable acclaim.
In 1967, Welles began directing &quot;The Deep&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Dead Calm&quot; by Charles Williams and filmed off the shore of Yugoslavia. The cast included Moreau, Kodar and Laurence Harvey. Personally financed by Welles and Kodar, they could not obtain the funds to complete the project, and it was abandoned a few years later after the death of Harvey. The surviving footage was eventually edited and released by the Filmmuseum München. In 1968 Welles began filming a TV special for CBS under the title &quot;Orson&#x27;s Bag&quot;, combining travelogue, comedy skits and a condensation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; with Welles as Shylock. In 1969 Welles called again the Film Editor Frederick Muller to work with him re-editing the material and they set up cutting rooms at the Safa Palatino Studios in Rome. Funding for the show sent by CBS to Welles in Switzerland was seized by the IRS. Without funding, the show was not completed. The surviving film clips portions were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.

In 1969, Welles authorized the use of his name for a cinema in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Orson Welles Cinema remained in operation until 1986, with Welles making a personal appearance there in 1977. Also in 1969, he played a supporting role in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Kremlin Letter&quot;. Drawn by the numerous offers he received to work in television and films, and upset by a tabloid scandal reporting his affair with Kodar, Welles abandoned the editing of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and moved back to America in 1970.

== Later career (1970–1985) ==

Welles returned to Hollywood, where he continued to self-finance his film and television projects. While offers to act, narrate and host continued, Welles also found himself in great demand on television talk shows. He made frequent appearances for Dick Cavett, Johnny Carson, Dean Martin and Merv Griffin. Welles&#x27;s primary focus during his final years was &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;, a project that was filmed intermittently between 1970 and 1976. Co-written by Welles and Oja Kodar, it is the story of an aging film director (John Huston) looking for funds to complete his final film. The cast includes Peter Bogdanovich, Susan Strasberg, Norman Foster, Edmond O&#x27;Brien, Cameron Mitchell and Dennis Hopper. Financed by Iranian backers, ownership of the film fell into a legal quagmire after the Shah of Iran was deposed. The legal disputes kept the film in its unfinished state until early 2017 and it was finally released in November 2018.

 Welles portrayed Louis XVIII of France in the 1970 film &quot;Waterloo&quot;, and narrated the beginning and ending scenes of the historical comedy &quot;Start the Revolution Without Me&quot; (1970).

In 1971, Welles directed a short adaptation of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, a one-man performance on a bare stage, reminiscent of his 1955 stage production &quot;Moby Dick – Rehearsed&quot;. Never completed, it was eventually released by the Filmmuseum München. He also appeared in &quot;Ten Days&#x27; Wonder&quot;, co-starring with Anthony Perkins and directed by Claude Chabrol (who reciprocated with a bit part as himself in &quot;Other Wind&quot;), based on a detective novel by Ellery Queen. That same year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave him an Academy Honorary Award &quot;for superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures.&quot; Welles pretended to be out of town and sent John Huston to claim the award, thanking the Academy on film. In his speech, Huston criticized the Academy for presenting the award while refusing to support Welles&#x27;s projects. In 1972, Welles acted as on-screen narrator for the film documentary version of Alvin Toffler&#x27;s 1970 book &quot;Future Shock&quot;. Working again for a British producer, Welles played Long John Silver in director John Hough&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1972), an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s novel, which had been the second story broadcast by &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; in 1938. This was the last time he played the lead role in a major film. Welles also contributed to the script, although his writing credit was attributed to the pseudonym &#x27;O. W. Jeeves&#x27;. In some versions of the film Welles&#x27;s original recorded dialog was redubbed by Robert Rietty.

In 1973, Welles completed &quot;F for Fake&quot;, a personal essay film about art forger Elmyr de Hory and the biographer Clifford Irving. Based on an existing documentary by François Reichenbach, it included new material with Oja Kodar, Joseph Cotten, Paul Stewart and William Alland. An excerpt of Welles&#x27;s 1930s &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast was recreated for this film; however, none of the dialogue heard in the film actually matches what was originally broadcast. Welles filmed a five-minute trailer, rejected in the U.S., that featured several shots of a topless Kodar. Welles hosted a British syndicated anthology series, &quot;Orson Welles&#x27;s Great Mysteries&quot;, during the 1973–74 television season. His brief introductions to the 26 half-hour episodes were shot in July 1973 by Gary Graver. The year 1974 also saw Welles lending his voice to &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; produced by his former associate, Harry Alan Towers and starring an international cast that included Oliver Reed, Elke Sommer and Herbert Lom. In 1975, Welles narrated the documentary &quot;Bugs Bunny: Superstar&quot;, focusing on Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1940s. Also in 1975, the American Film Institute presented Welles with its third Lifetime Achievement Award (the first two going to John Ford and James Cagney). At the ceremony, Welles screened two scenes from the nearly finished &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;.

In 1976, Paramount Television purchased the rights for the entire corpus of Nero Wolfe stories for Welles. Welles had once wanted to make a series of Nero Wolfe movies, but author Rex Stout—who was leery of Hollywood adaptations during his lifetime after two disappointing 1930s films—turned him down. Paramount planned to begin with an ABC-TV movie and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a miniseries. Frank D. Gilroy was signed to write the television script and direct the TV movie on the assurance that Welles would star, but by April 1977 Welles had bowed out. In 1980 the Associated Press reported &quot;the distinct possibility&quot; that Welles would star in a Nero Wolfe TV series for NBC television. Again, Welles left the project due to creative differences with Paramount. William Conrad was cast in the role.

In 1979, Welles completed his documentary &quot;Filming Othello&quot;, featuring Michael MacLiammoir and Hilton Edwards. Made for West German television, it was also released in theaters. That same year, Welles completed his self-produced pilot for &quot;The Orson Welles Show&quot;, featuring interviews with Burt Reynolds, Jim Henson and Frank Oz and guest-starring the Muppets and Angie Dickinson. Unable to find network interest, the pilot was never broadcast. Also in 1979, Welles appeared in the biopic &quot;The Secret of Nikola Tesla&quot;, and made a cameo in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;. Beginning in the late 1970s, Welles participated in a series of famous television commercial advertisements. For two years he was on-camera spokesman for the Paul Masson Vineyards, and sales grew by one third during the time Welles intoned what became a popular catchphrase: &quot;We will sell no wine before its time.&quot; Years later, the commercials regained notoriety when a bootleg recording of out-takes was distributed, showing an apparently inebriated Welles on the set of one of the commercials. He was also the voice behind the long-running Carlsberg &quot;Probably the best lager in the world&quot; campaign, promoted Domecq sherry on British television and provided narration on adverts for Findus, though the actual adverts have been overshadowed by a famous blooper reel of voice recordings, known as the Frozen Peas reel. He also did commercials for the Preview Subscription Television Service seen on stations around the country including WCLQ/Cleveland, KNDL/St. Louis and WSMW/Boston.

In 1981, Welles hosted the documentary &quot;The Man Who Saw Tomorrow&quot;, about Nostradamus. In 1982, the BBC broadcast &quot;The Orson Welles Story&quot; in the &quot;Arena&quot; series. Interviewed by Leslie Megahey, Welles examined his past in great detail, and several people from his professional past were interviewed as well. It was reissued in 1990 as &quot;With Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film&quot;. Welles provided narration for a 1982 documentary on American public television, the tracks &quot;Defender&quot; from Manowar&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Fighting the World&quot; and &quot;Dark Avenger&quot; on their 1982 album, &quot;Battle Hymns&quot;. He also recorded the concert introduction for the live performances of Manowar that says, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, from the United States of America, all hail Manowar.&quot; Manowar have been using this introduction for all of their concerts since then. During the 1980s, Welles worked on such film projects as &quot;The Dreamers&quot;, based on two stories by Isak Dinesen and starring Oja Kodar, and &quot;Orson Welles&#x27; Magic Show&quot;, which reused material from his failed TV pilot. Another project he worked on was &quot;Filming the Trial&quot;, the second in a proposed series of documentaries examining his feature films. While much was shot for these projects, none of them was completed. All of them were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.

In the mid-1980s, Henry Jaglom taped lunch conversations with Welles at Los Angeles&#x27;s Ma Maison as well as in New York. Recordings of these sessions were edited by Peter Biskind and published in the 2013 book &quot;My Lunches With Orson&quot;.

In 1984, Welles narrated the short-lived television series &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;. During the early years of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, Welles was the voice of the unseen character Robin Masters, a famous writer and playboy. Welles&#x27;s death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series. In an oblique homage to Welles, the &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; producers ambiguously concluded that story arc by having one character accuse another of having hired an actor to portray Robin Masters. He also, in this penultimate year, released a music single, titled &quot;I Know What It Is to Be Young (But You Don&#x27;t Know What It Is to Be Old)&quot;, which he recorded under Italian label Compagnia Generale del Disco. The song was performed with the Nick Perito Orchestra and the Ray Charles Singers and produced by Jerry Abbott.

The last film roles before Welles&#x27;s death included voice work in the animated films &quot;Enchanted Journey&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; (1986), in which he provided the voice for the planet-eating supervillain Unicron. His last film appearance was in Henry Jaglom&#x27;s 1987 independent film &quot;Someone to Love&quot;, released two years after his death but produced before his voice-over in &quot;Transformers: The Movie&quot;. His last television appearance was on &quot;Moonlighting&quot;. He recorded an introduction to an episode entitled &quot;The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice&quot;, which was partially filmed in black and white. The episode aired five days after his death and was dedicated to his memory.

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships and family ===

Orson Welles and Chicago-born actress and socialite Virginia Nicolson were married on November 14, 1934. &quot;Regardless of his later comments, the two were very much in love,&quot; wrote biographer Patrick McGilligan, &quot;and she was his salvation.&quot; The couple separated in December 1939 and were divorced on February 1, 1940. A few months later, on May 18, 1940, she married Marion Davies&#x27; nephew Charles Lederer.

After bearing with Welles&#x27;s romances in New York, Virginia had learned that Welles had fallen in love with Mexican actress Dolores del Río. Infatuated with her since adolescence, Welles met del Río at Darryl Zanuck&#x27;s ranch soon after he moved to Hollywood in 1939. Their relationship was kept secret until 1941, when del Río filed for divorce from her second husband. They openly appeared together in New York while Welles was directing the Mercury stage production &quot;Native Son&quot;. They acted together in the movie &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; (1943). Their relationship came to an end due, among other things, to Welles&#x27;s infidelities. Del Río returned to Mexico in 1943, shortly before Welles married Rita Hayworth.
Welles married Hayworth on September 7, 1943. They were divorced on November 10, 1947. During his last interview, recorded for &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; on the evening before his death, Welles called Hayworth &quot;one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived ... and we were a long time together—I was lucky enough to have been with her longer than any of the other men in her life.&quot;
In 1955, Welles married actress Paola Mori (née Countess Paola di Gerfalco), an Italian aristocrat who starred as Raina Arkadin in his 1955 film &quot;Mr. Arkadin&quot;. The couple began a passionate affair, and they were married at her parents&#x27; insistence. They were wed in London on May 8, 1955, and never divorced.

Croatian-born artist and actress Oja Kodar became Welles&#x27;s longtime companion and mistress both personally and professionally from 1966 onward. They lived together for some of the last 20 years of his life.

Welles had three daughters from his marriages: Christopher Welles Feder (born 1938, with Virginia Nicolson); Rebecca Welles Manning (1944–2004, with Rita Hayworth); and Beatrice Welles (born 1955, with Paola Mori).

Welles has been thought to have had a son, British director Michael Lindsay-Hogg (born 1940), with Irish actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, then the wife of Sir Edward Lindsay-Hogg, 4th baronet. When Lindsay-Hogg was 16, his mother reluctantly divulged pervasive rumors that his father was Welles, and she denied them—but in such detail that he doubted her veracity. Fitzgerald evaded the subject for the rest of her life. Lindsay-Hogg knew Welles, worked with him in the theatre and met him at intervals throughout Welles&#x27;s life. After learning that Welles&#x27;s oldest daughter, Chris, his childhood playmate, had long suspected that he was her brother, Lindsay-Hogg initiated a DNA test that proved inconclusive. In his 2011 autobiography, Lindsay-Hogg reported that his questions were resolved by his mother&#x27;s close friend Gloria Vanderbilt, who wrote that Fitzgerald had told her that Welles was his father. A 2015 Welles biography by Patrick McGilligan, however, reports the impossibility of Welles&#x27;s paternity: Fitzgerald left the U.S. for Ireland in May 1939, and her son was conceived before her return in late October, whereas Welles did not travel overseas during that period.

After the death of Rebecca Welles Manning, a man named Marc McKerrow was revealed to be her son—and therefore a direct descendant of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth—after he requested his adoption records unsealed. While McKerrow and Rebecca were never able to meet due to her cancer, they were in touch before her death, and he attended her funeral. McKerrow&#x27;s reactions to the revelation and his meeting with Oja Kodar are documented in the 2008 film &quot;Prodigal Sons&quot;, produced and directed by his sister Kimberly Reed. McKerrow died on June 18, 2010, suddenly in his sleep at the age of 44. His death was attributed to complications from a seizure related to injuries he received in a car accident when he was younger.

In the 1940s, Welles had a brief relationship with Maila Nurmi. According to the biography &quot;Glamour Ghoul: The Passions and Pain of the Real Vampira, Maila Nurmi&quot;, she became pregnant; since Welles was then married to Hayworth, Nurmi gave the child up for adoption. However, the child mentioned in the book was born in 1944. Nurmi revealed in an interview weeks before her death in January 2008 that she met Welles in a New York casting office in the spring of 1946.

Despite an urban legend promoted by Welles, he is not related to Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s wartime Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles. The myth dates back to the first newspaper feature ever written about Welles—&quot;Cartoonist, Actor, Poet and only 10&quot;—in the February 19, 1926, issue of &quot;The Capital Times&quot;. The article falsely states that he was descended from &quot;Gideon Welles, who was a member of President Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet&quot;. As presented by Charles Higham in a genealogical chart that introduces his 1985 biography of Welles, Orson Welles&#x27;s father was Richard Head Welles (born Wells), son of Richard Jones Wells, son of Henry Hill Wells (who had an uncle named Gideon &quot;Wells&quot;), son of William Hill Wells, son of Richard Wells (1734–1801).

=== Physical characteristics ===

Peter Noble&#x27;s 1956 biography describes Welles as &quot;a magnificent figure of a man, over six feet tall, handsome, with flashing eyes and a gloriously resonant speaking-voice&quot;. Welles said that a voice specialist once told him he was born to be a heldentenor, a heroic tenor, but that when he was young and working at the Gate Theatre in Dublin, he forced his voice down into a bass-baritone.

Even as a baby, Welles was prone to illness, including diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, and malaria. From infancy he suffered from asthma, sinus headaches, and backache that was later found to be caused by congenital anomalies of the spine. Foot and ankle trouble throughout his life was the result of flat feet. &quot;As he grew older&quot;, Brady wrote, &quot;his ill health was exacerbated by the late hours he was allowed to keep [and] an early penchant for alcohol and tobacco&quot;.

In 1928, at age 13, Welles was already more than six feet tall (1.83 meters) and weighed over . His passport recorded his height as , with brown hair and green eyes.

&quot;Crash diets, [pharmaceutical] drugs, and corsets had slimmed him for his early film roles&quot;, wrote biographer Barton Whaley. &quot;Then always back to gargantuan consumption of high-caloric food and booze. By summer 1949, when he was 34, his weight had crept up to a stout . In 1953, he ballooned from . After 1960, he remained permanently obese.&quot;

=== Religious beliefs ===

When Peter Bogdanovich once asked him about his religion, Welles gruffly replied that it was none of his business, then misinformed him that he was raised Catholic. Although the Welles family was no longer devout, it was fourth-generation Episcopalian and before that, Quaker and Puritan. The funeral of Welles&#x27;s father, Richard H. Welles, was Episcopalian.

In April 1982, when interviewer Merv Griffin asked him about his religious beliefs, Welles replied, &quot;I try to be a Christian. I don&#x27;t pray really, because I don&#x27;t want to bore God.&quot;

Near the end of his life, Welles was dining at Ma Maison, his favorite restaurant in Los Angeles, when proprietor Patrick Terrail conveyed an invitation from the head of the Greek Orthodox Church, who asked Welles to be his guest of honor at divine liturgy at Saint Sophia Cathedral. Welles replied, &quot;Please tell him I really appreciate that offer, but I am an atheist.&quot;

&quot;Orson never joked or teased about the religious beliefs of others&quot;, wrote biographer Barton Whaley. &quot;He accepted it as a cultural artifact, suitable for the births, deaths, and marriages of strangers and even some friends—but without emotional or intellectual meaning for himself.&quot;

=== Politics and activism ===

Welles was politically active from the beginning of his career. He remained aligned with left-wing politics and the American Left throughout his life, and always defined his political orientation as &quot;progressive&quot;. A Democrat, he was an outspoken critic of racism in the United States and the practice of segregation. He was a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal and often spoke out on radio in support of progressive politics. He campaigned heavily for Roosevelt in the 1944 election.

In a 1983 conversation with his friend Roger Hill, Welles recalled: &quot;During a White House dinner, when I was campaigning for Roosevelt, in a toast, with considerable tongue in cheek, he said, &#x27;Orson, you and I are the two greatest actors alive today.&#x27; In private that evening, and on several other occasions, he urged me to run for a Senate seat in either California or Wisconsin. He wasn&#x27;t alone.&quot; In the 1980s, Welles still expressed admiration for Roosevelt but also described his presidency as &quot;a semidictatorship&quot;.

During a 1970 appearance on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, Welles claimed to have met Hitler while hiking in Austria with a teacher who was a &quot;budding Nazi&quot;. He said that Hitler made no impression on him and that he could not remember anything of him from the encounter. He said that he had no personality at all: &quot;He was invisible. There was nothing there until there were 5,000 people yelling sieg heil.&quot;

In 1946, Welles took to the airwaves in a series of radio broadcasts demanding justice for a decorated black veteran, Isaac Woodard, who had been beaten and blinded by white police officers. Welles devoted his July 28, 1946, program to reading Woodard&#x27;s affidavit and vowing to bring the officer responsible to justice. He continued his crusade over four subsequent Sunday afternoon broadcasts on ABC Radio. &quot;The NAACP felt that these broadcasts did more than anything else to prompt the Justice Department to act on the case,&quot; the Museum of Broadcasting stated in its 1988 retrospect &quot;Orson Welles on the Air: The Radio Years&quot;.

For several years, he wrote a newspaper column on political issues and considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1946, representing his home state of Wisconsin—a seat that was ultimately won by Joseph McCarthy.

Welles&#x27;s political activities were reported on pages 155–157 of &quot;Red Channels&quot;, the anti-Communist publication that, in part, fueled the already flourishing Hollywood Blacklist. He was in Europe during the height of the Red Scare, thereby adding one more reason for the Hollywood establishment to ostracize him.

In 1970, Welles narrated (but did not write) a satirical political record on the rise of President Richard Nixon titled &quot;The Begatting of the President&quot;.

In the late 1970s, Welles referred to Josip Tito as &quot;the greatest man in the world today&quot; on Yugoslav television.

Welles spoke before a crowd of 700,000 at a nuclear disarmament rally in Central Park on June 12, 1982, and attacked the policies of President Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party.

&quot;&quot;, a documentary by Danny Wu that looks at Welles&#x27;s life against the political landscape of the 1930s and 1940s, had its premiere at the Newport Beach Film Festival in October 2022.

== Death and tributes ==

On the evening of October 9, 1985, Welles recorded his final interview on the syndicated TV program &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, appearing with biographer Barbara Leaming. &quot;Both Welles and Leaming talked of Welles&#x27;s life, and the segment was a nostalgic interlude,&quot; wrote biographer Frank Brady. Welles returned to his house in Hollywood and worked into the early hours typing stage directions for the project he and Gary Graver were planning to shoot at UCLA the following day. Welles died sometime on the morning of October 10, following a heart attack. He was found by his chauffeur at around 10 a.m.; the first of Welles&#x27;s friends to arrive was Paul Stewart. Welles was 70 years old when he died.

Welles was cremated by prior agreement with the executor of his estate, Greg Garrison, whose advice about making lucrative TV appearances in the 1970s made it possible for Welles to pay off a portion of the taxes he owed the IRS. A brief private funeral was attended by Paola Mori and Welles&#x27;s three daughters—the first time they had ever been together. Only a few close friends were invited: Garrison, Graver, Roger Hill and Prince Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Chris Welles Feder later described the funeral as an awful experience.

A public memorial tribute took place November 2, 1985, at the Directors Guild of America Theater in Los Angeles. Host Peter Bogdanovich introduced speakers including Charles Champlin, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Greg Garrison, Charlton Heston, Roger Hill, Henry Jaglom, Arthur Knight, Oja Kodar, Barbara Leaming, Janet Leigh, Norman Lloyd, Dan O&#x27;Herlihy, Patrick Terrail and Robert Wise.

&quot;I know what his feelings were regarding his death&quot;, Joseph Cotten later wrote. &quot;He did not want a funeral; he wanted to be buried quietly in a little place in Spain. He wanted no memorial services ...&quot; Cotten declined to attend the memorial program; instead, he sent a short message, ending with the last two lines of a Shakespeare sonnet that Welles had sent him on his most recent birthday:

But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,All losses are restored and sorrows end.

In 1987 Welles&#x27;s ashes were taken to Ronda, Spain, and buried in an old well covered by flowers on the rural estate of a longtime friend, bullfighter Antonio Ordóñez.

== Legacy and reception ==

David Thomson credits Welles with &quot;the creation of a visual style that is simultaneously baroque and precise, overwhelmingly emotional, and unerringly founded in reality.&quot; Peter Bogdanovich, who was directed by Welles in &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;, wrote: being directed by Welles was like breathing pure oxygen all day long. He was so totally in control that he never had to prove a point out of any kind. I never saw him get angry or impatient, or raise his voice in any way but hilarity... Sometimes Orson was holding the camera himself, but wherever the camera was, he had put it there, and all the lights were placed exactly where he said they were to be put. There wasn&#x27;t anything seen or heard in any scene that wasn&#x27;t there because Orson wanted it that way, but he was never dictatorial. Welles was a lifelong lover of Shakespeare, and Bogdanovich writes that &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot;, in which Welles plays John Falstaff, is &quot;arguably his best film, and his own personal favorite&quot;; Joseph McBride and Jonathan Rosenbaum have called it Welles&#x27;s masterpiece, and Vincent Canby wrote &quot;it may be the greatest Shakespearean film ever made.&quot;

After Welles went to South America to film the documentary &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot;, RKO cut more than forty minutes from &quot;Ambersons&quot; and added a happier ending, against his wishes. The missing footage from Ambersons has been called a &quot;holy grail&quot; of cinema. Welles wrote a 58-page memo to Universal about the editing of &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;, which they disregarded. In 1998, Walter Murch reedited the film according to Welles&#x27;s specifications. With a development spanning almost 50 years, Welles&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;, was posthumously released in 2018.

Known for his baritone voice, Welles performed extensively across theatre, radio, and film. He was a lifelong magician, noted for presenting troop variety shows in the war years.

== Accolades ==

Welles received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, Peabody Award and Grammy Award as well as nominations for a BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award. His honors include the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1975, the British Film Institute Fellowship in 1983, and the Directors Guild of America Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984. He was inducted into both the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1979, and the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1988. Welles was presented with France&#x27;s Legion of Honour in 1982.

== Filmography ==

Welles is known for his work in film as a director, actor and screenwriter. 
Welles&#x27;s reliance on self-production meant that many of his later projects were filmed piecemeal or remained incomplete. He financed these endeavors through his own fundraising activities, often supplementing his income with additional work to fund his films.

<text>Ohio ( ) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. It borders Lake Erie to the north, Pennsylvania to the east, West Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Indiana to the west, and Michigan to the northwest. Of the 50 U.S. states, it is the 34th-largest by area. With a population of nearly 11.9 million, Ohio is the seventh-most populous and tenth-most densely populated state. Its capital and most populous city is Columbus, with the two other major metropolitan centers being Cleveland and Cincinnati, alongside Dayton, Akron, and Toledo. Ohio is nicknamed the &quot;Buckeye State&quot; after its Ohio buckeye trees, and Ohioans are also known as &quot;Buckeyes&quot;.

Ohio derives its name from the Ohio River that forms its southern border, which, in turn, originated from the Seneca word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;good river&quot;, &quot;great river&quot;, or &quot;large creek&quot;. The state was home to several ancient indigenous civilizations, with humans present as early as 10,000 BCE. It arose from the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains that were contested by various native tribes and European colonists from the 17th century through the Northwest Indian Wars of the late 18th century. Ohio was partitioned from the Northwest Territory, the first frontier of the new United States, becoming the 17th state admitted to the Union on March 1, 1803, and the first under the Northwest Ordinance. It was the first post-colonial free state admitted to the union and became one of the earliest and most influential industrial powerhouses during the 20th century.

Although it has transitioned to a more information- and service-based economy in the 21st century, it remains an industrial state, ranking seventh in GDP , with the third-largest manufacturing sector and second-largest automobile production. Modeled on its federal counterpart, Ohio&#x27;s government is composed of the executive branch, led by the governor; the legislative branch, consisting of the bicameral Ohio General Assembly; and the judicial branch, led by the state Supreme Court. Ohio occupies 15 seats in the United States House of Representatives, the seventh-largest delegation. Seven presidents of the United States have come from Ohio, earning it the moniker &quot;the Mother of Presidents&quot;.

==History==
===Indigenous settlement===

Archeological evidence of spear points of both the Folsom and Clovis types indicate that the Ohio Valley was inhabited by nomadic people as early as 13,000 BC. These early nomads disappeared from Ohio by 1,000 BC. Between 1,000 and 800 BC, the sedentary Adena culture emerged. The Adena established &quot;semi-permanent&quot; villages because they domesticated plants, including sunflowers, and &quot;grew squash and possibly corn&quot;; with hunting and gathering, this cultivation supported more settled, complex villages. The most notable remnant of the Adena culture is the Great Serpent Mound, located in Adams County, Ohio.

Around 100 BC, the Adena evolved into the Hopewell people, who were also mound builders. Their complex, large and technologically sophisticated earthworks can be found in modern-day Marietta, Newark, and Circleville. They were also a prolific trading society, their trading network spanning a third of the continent. The Hopewell disappeared from the Ohio Valley about 600 AD. The Mississippian culture rose as the Hopewell culture declined. Many Siouan-speaking peoples from the plains and east coast claim them as ancestors and say they lived throughout the Ohio region until approximately the 13th century.

There were three other cultures contemporaneous with the Mississippians: the Fort Ancient people, the Whittlesey Culture and the Monongahela Culture. All three disappeared in the 17th century. Their origins are unknown. The Shawnees may have absorbed the Fort Ancient people. It is also possible that the Monongahela held no land in Ohio during the Colonial Era. The Mississippian culture was close to and traded extensively with the Fort Ancient people.

Indians in the Ohio Valley were greatly affected by the aggressive tactics of the Iroquois Confederation, based in central and western New York. After the Beaver Wars in the mid-17th century, the Iroquois claimed much of the Ohio country as hunting and, more importantly, beaver-trapping ground. After the devastation of epidemics and war in the mid-17th century, which largely emptied the Ohio country of Indigenous people by the mid-to-late 17th century, the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly Algonquian. Many of these Ohio-country nations were multiethnic (sometimes multi-linguistic) societies born out of the earlier devastation brought about by disease, war, and subsequent social instability. They subsisted on agriculture (corn, sunflowers, beans, etc.) supplemented by seasonal hunts. By the 18th century, they were part of a larger global economy brought about by European entry into the fur trade.

Some of the Indigenous nations that historically inhabited Ohio include the Iroquoian, the Algonquian, and the Siouan. Ohio country was also the site of Indian massacres, such as the Yellow Creek massacre and the Gnadenhutten massacre. After the War of 1812, when Natives suffered serious losses such as at Tippecanoe, most Native tribes either left Ohio or had to live on only limited reservations. By 1842, all remaining Natives were forced out of the state.

===Colonial and Revolutionary eras===
During the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region. Beginning in 1754, the Kingdom of France and Kingdom of Great Britain fought in the French and Indian War, with various Native American tribes on each side. As a result of the Treaty of Paris, the French ceded control of Ohio and the remainder of the Old Northwest to Great Britain in 1763.

Before the American Revolution, Britain thinly exercised sovereignty over Ohio Country by lackadaisical garrisoning of the French forts. Just beyond Ohio Country was the great Miami capital of Kekionga, which became the center of British trade and influence in Ohio Country and throughout the future Northwest Territory. By the Royal Proclamation of 1763, British lands west of Appalachia were forbidden to settlement by colonists. The Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 explicitly reserved lands north and west of the Ohio as Native lands. British military occupation in the region contributed to the outbreak of Pontiac&#x27;s War in 1763. Ohio tribes participated in the war until an armed expedition in Ohio led by Brigadier General Henry Bouquet brought about a truce. Another colonial military expedition into the Ohio Country in 1774 brought Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, kicked off by the Yellow Creek massacre in Ohio, to a conclusion. In 1774, Britain passed the Quebec Act, which formally annexed Ohio and other western lands to the Province of Quebec in order to provide a civil government and to centralize British administration of the Montreal-based fur trade. The prohibition of settlement west of the Appalachians remained, contributing to the American Revolution.

By the start of the American Revolutionary War, the movement of Natives and Americans between the Ohio Country and Thirteen Colonies had resulted in tension. Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania had become the main fort where expeditions into Ohio started. Intrusions into the area included General Edward Hand&#x27;s 1778 movement of 500 Pennsylvania militiamen from Fort Pitt towards Mingo towns on the Cuyahoga River, where the British stored military supplies which they distributed to Indian raiding parties; Colonel Daniel Brodhead&#x27;s invasion in 1780 and destruction of the Lenape Indian capital of Coshocton; a detachment of one hundred of George Rogers Clark&#x27;s troops that were ambushed near the Ohio River by Indians led by Joseph Brant in the same year; a British and Native American attack on the U.S.&#x27; Fort Laurens; and the 1782 detainment and murder of 96 Moravian Lenape pacifists by Pennsylvania militiamen in the Gnadenhutten massacre.

The western theatre never had a decisive victor. In the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Britain ceded all claims to Ohio Country to the new United States after its victory in the American Revolutionary War.

===Northwest Territory===
The United States created the Northwest Territory under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Slavery was not permitted in the new territory. Settlement began with the founding of Marietta by the Ohio Company of Associates, which had been formed by a group of American Revolutionary War veterans. Following the Ohio Company, the Miami Company (also referred to as the &quot;Symmes Purchase&quot;) claimed the southwestern section, and the Connecticut Land Company surveyed and settled the Connecticut Western Reserve in present-day Northeast Ohio. Territorial surveyors from Fort Steuben began surveying an area of eastern Ohio called the Seven Ranges at about the same time.

The old Northwest Territory originally included areas previously known as Ohio Country and Illinois Country. As Ohio prepared for statehood, the Indiana Territory was created, reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and the eastern tip of the Upper Peninsula and a sliver of southeastern Indiana called &quot;The Gore&quot;.

The coalition of Native American tribes, known as the Western Confederacy, was forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day Ohio, in the Treaty of Greenville in 1795.

Under the Northwest Ordinance, areas could be defined and admitted as states once their population reached 60,000. Although Ohio&#x27;s population was only 45,000 in December 1801, Congress determined that it was growing rapidly enough and accelerated the process via the Enabling Act of 1802. In regard to the Leni Lenape natives, Congress decided that 10,000 acres on the Muskingum River in the present state of Ohio would &quot;be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the Moravian Brethren ... or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity&quot;.

====Rufus Putnam, the &quot;Father of Ohio&quot;====
Rufus Putnam served in important military capacities in both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. He was one of the most highly respected men in the early years of the United States.

In 1776, Putnam created a method of building portable fortifications, which enabled the Continental Army to drive the British from Boston. George Washington was so impressed that he made Putnam his chief engineer. After the war, Putnam and Manasseh Cutler were instrumental in creating the Northwest Ordinance, which opened up the Northwest Territory for settlement. This land was used to serve as compensation for what was owed to Revolutionary War veterans. Putnam organized and led the Ohio Company of Associates, who settled at Marietta, Ohio, where they built a large fort, Campus Martius. He set substantial amounts of land aside for schools. In 1798, he created the plan for the construction of the Muskingum Academy (now Marietta College). In 1780, the directors of the Ohio Company appointed him superintendent of all its affairs relating to the settlement north of the Ohio River. In 1796, President George Washington commissioned him as Surveyor-General of United States Lands. In 1788, he served as a judge in the Northwest Territory&#x27;s first court. In 1802, he served in the convention to form a constitution for the State of Ohio.

===Statehood and early years===
On February 19, 1803, U.S. president Thomas Jefferson signed an act of Congress that approved Ohio&#x27;s boundaries and constitution. But Congress had not passed a formal resolution admitting Ohio as the 17th state. Although no formal resolution of admission was required, when the oversight was discovered in 1953, as Ohio began preparations for celebrating its sesquicentennial, Ohio congressman George H. Bender introduced a bill in Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803, the date on which the Ohio General Assembly first convened. At a special session at the old state capital in Chillicothe, the Ohio state legislature approved a new petition for statehood, which was delivered to Washington, D.C., on horseback, and approved that August.

Ohio has had three capital cities: Chillicothe, Zanesville, and Columbus. Chillicothe was the capital from 1803 to 1810. The capital was then moved to Zanesville for two years as part of a state legislative compromise to get a bill passed. The capital was then moved back to Chillicothe from 1812 to 1816. Finally, the capital was moved to Columbus, to be near the state&#x27;s geographic center.

Although many Native Americans migrated west to evade American encroachment, others remained in the state, sometimes assimilating in part. Starting around 1809, the Shawnee pressed resistance to encroachment again. Under Chief Tecumseh, Tecumseh&#x27;s War officially began in Ohio in 1811. When the War of 1812 began, the British decided to attack from Upper Canada into Ohio and merge their forces with the Shawnee. This continued until Tecumseh was killed at the Battle of the Thames in 1813. Most of the Shawnee, excluding the Pekowi in Southwest Ohio, were forcibly relocated west. Ohio played a key role in the War of 1812, as it was on the front line in the Western theater and the scene of several notable battles both on land and in Lake Erie. On September 10, 1813, the Battle of Lake Erie, one of the major battles, took place near Put-in-Bay, Ohio. The British eventually surrendered to Oliver Hazard Perry.

Ultimately, after the U.S. government used the Indian Removal Act of 1830 to force countless Native American tribes on the Trail of Tears, where all the southern states except for Florida were successfully emptied of Native peoples, the government panicked because most tribes did not want to be forced out of their own lands. Fearing further wars between Native tribes and American settlers, they pushed all remaining Native tribes in the East to migrate west against their will, including all remaining tribes in Ohio.

In 1835, Ohio fought with the Michigan Territory in the Toledo War, a mostly bloodless boundary war over the Toledo Strip. Only one person was injured in the conflict. Congress intervened, making Michigan&#x27;s admittance as a state conditional on ending the conflict. In exchange for giving up its claim to the Toledo Strip, Michigan was given the western two-thirds of the Upper Peninsula, in addition to the eastern third, which was already considered part of the territory.

===Civil War and industrialization===
Ohio&#x27;s central position and its population gave it an important place in the Civil War. The Ohio River was a vital artery for troop and supply movements, as were Ohio&#x27;s railroads. Ohio&#x27;s industry made it one of the most important states in the Union during the war. It contributed more soldiers per capita than any other state in the Union. In 1862, the state&#x27;s morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the Battle of Shiloh, a costly victory in which Ohio forces suffered 2,000 casualties. Later that year, when Confederate troops under the leadership of Stonewall Jackson threatened Washington, D.C., Ohio governor David Tod recruited 5,000 volunteers to provide three months of service. From July 13 to 26, 1863, towns along the Ohio River were attacked and ransacked in Morgan&#x27;s Raid, starting in Harrison in the west and culminating in the Battle of Salineville near West Point in the far east. While this raid was overall insignificant to the Confederacy, it aroused fear among people in Ohio and Indiana as it was the furthest advancement of troops from the South in the war. Almost 35,000 Ohioans died in the conflict, and 30,000 were physically wounded. By the end of the Civil War, the Union&#x27;s top three generals—Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan—were all from Ohio.

During much of the 19th century, industry was rapidly introduced to complement an existing agricultural economy. One of the first iron manufacturing plants, Hopewell Furnace, opened near Youngstown in 1804. By the mid-19th century, 48 blast furnaces were operating in Ohio, most in the southern part of the state. Discovery of coal deposits aided the further development of Ohio&#x27;s steel industry, and by 1853 Cleveland was the nation&#x27;s third-largest iron and steel producer. The first Bessemer converter was purchased by the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company, which became part of the U.S. Steel Corporation after the merger of Federal Steel Company and Carnegie Steel, the first billion-dollar American corporation. The first open-hearth furnace used for steel production was constructed by the Otis Steel Company in Cleveland, and by 1892, Ohio was the second-largest steel-producing state, behind Pennsylvania. Republic Steel was founded in Youngstown in 1899 and was at one point the nation&#x27;s third-largest producer. Armco, now AK Steel, was founded in Middletown in 1899.

===20th century===
The state legislature officially adopted the flag of Ohio on May 9, 1902. Dayton natives Orville and Wilbur Wright made four brief flights at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, inventing the first successful airplane. Ohio was hit by its greatest natural disaster in the Great Flood of 1913, resulting in at least 428 fatalities and hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage, particularly around the Great Miami River basin.

The National Football League was originally founded in Canton, Ohio in 1920 as the American Professional Football Conference. It included Ohio League teams in five Ohio cities (Akron, Canton, Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton), none of which still exist. The first official game occurred on October 3, 1920, when the Dayton Triangles beat the Columbus Panhandles 14–0 in Dayton. Canton was enshrined as the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.

During the 1930s, the Great Depression struck the state hard. By 1933, more than 40% of factory workers and 67% of construction workers were unemployed in Ohio. Approximately 50% of industrial workers in Cleveland and 80% in Toledo became unemployed, with the state unemployment rate reaching a high of 37.3%. American Jews watched the rise of Nazi Germany with apprehension. Cleveland residents Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created the Superman comic character in the spirit of the Jewish golem. Many of their comics portrayed Superman fighting and defeating the Nazis. Approximately 839,000 Ohioans served in the U.S. armed forces during World War II, of whom over 23,000 died or were missing in action.

Artists, writers, musicians and actors developed in the state throughout the 20th century and often moved to other cities that were larger centers for their work. They included Zane Grey, Milton Caniff, George Bellows, Art Tatum, Roy Lichtenstein, and Roy Rogers. Alan Freed, who emerged from the swing dance culture in Cleveland, hosted the first live rock &#x27;n roll concert in Cleveland in 1952. Famous filmmakers include Steven Spielberg, Chris Columbus and the original Warner Brothers, who set up their first movie theatre in Youngstown before the company relocated to California. The state produced many popular musicians, including Dean Martin, Doris Day, The O&#x27;Jays, Marilyn Manson, Dave Grohl, Devo, Macy Gray and The Isley Brothers.

Two Ohio astronauts completed significant milestones in the space race in the 1960s: John Glenn becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, and Neil Armstrong becoming the first human to walk on the Moon. In 1967, Carl Stokes was elected mayor of Cleveland and became the first African American mayor of one of the nation&#x27;s 10 most populous cities.

In 1970, an Ohio Army National Guard unit fired at students during an antiwar protest at Kent State University, killing four and wounding nine. The Guard had been called onto campus after several protests in and around campus became violent, including a riot in downtown Kent and the burning of an ROTC building. The main cause of the protests was the United States&#x27; invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.

Ohio was an important state in the developing ties between the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Relations between the two countries normalized in 1979, during the second term of Ohio governor Jim Rhodes. Rhodes sought to encourage economic ties, viewing China as a potential market for Ohio machinery exports. In July 1979, Rhodes led a State of Ohio Trade Mission to China. The trip resulted in developing economic ties, a sister state-province relationship with Hubei province, long-running Chinese exhibitions at the Ohio State Fair, and major academic exchanges between Ohio State University and Wuhan University. Beginning in the 1980s, the state entered into international economic and resource cooperation treaties and organizations with other Midwestern states, as well as New York, Pennsylvania, Ontario, and Quebec, including the Great Lakes Charter, Great Lakes Compact, and the Council of Great Lakes Governors.

===21st century===
Ohio&#x27;s economy has undergone significant change in the 21st century, as the trend of deindustrialization has greatly impacted the American Midwest and the Rust Belt. Manufacturing in the Midwest experienced a stark decline during the early 21st century, a trend that greatly impacted Ohio. From 1990 to 2019, it lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs, but added over 1,000,000 non-manufacturing jobs. Coinciding with this decline, Ohio has seen a large decline in union membership: 17.4% of Ohioan workers were union members in 2000, while 12.8% were union members in 2022.

In the wake of these economic changes, Ohio&#x27;s state government has looked to promoting new industries to offset manufacturing losses, such as the production of solar energy and electric vehicles. One major program the state government launched was the &quot;Third Frontier&quot; program, created during the governorship of Bob Taft, which aimed to increase investment in Ohio and boost its technology sector. As of 2010, the Ohio Department of Development attributes the creation of 9,500 jobs to this program, with an average salary of $65,000, while having a $6.6 billion economic impact with a return on investment of 9:1. In 2010 the state won the International Economic Development Council&#x27;s Excellence in Economic Development Award, celebrated as a national model of success.

Ohio&#x27;s economy was also heavily afflicted by the Great Recession, as the state&#x27;s unemployment rate rose from 5.6% in the first two months of 2008 up to a peak of 11.1% in December 2009 and January 2010. It took until August 2014 for the unemployment rate to return to 5.6%. From December 2007 to September 2010, Ohio lost 376,500 jobs. In 2009, Ohio had 89,053 foreclosures filings, a then-record for the state. The median household income dropped 7% from 2006–07 to 2008–09, and the poverty rate ballooned to 13.5% by 2009. By 2015, Ohio gross domestic product was $608.1 billion, the seventh-largest economy among the 50 states. In 2015, Ohio&#x27;s total GDP accounted for 3.4% of U.S. GDP and 0.8% of world GDP.

Politically, Ohio has been long regarded as a swing state, but the success of many Republican candidates in Ohio since the late 2000s has led many to question whether Ohio remains an electoral battleground.

On March 9, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic reached Ohio, with three cases reported. As of February 2023, over 41,600 Ohioans have died from COVID-19. Ohio&#x27;s economy was also heavily impacted by the pandemic, as the state saw large job losses in 2020, as well as large amounts of subsequent stimulus spending.

==Geography==

Ohio&#x27;s location has proven to be an asset for economic growth and expansion. Because it links the Northeast to the Midwest, much cargo and business traffic passes through its borders along its well-developed highways. Ohio has the nation&#x27;s 10th-largest highway network and is within a one-day drive of 50% of North America&#x27;s population and 70% of North America&#x27;s manufacturing capacity. To the north, Ohio has of coastline with Lake Erie, which allows for numerous cargo ports such as Cleveland and Toledo. Ohio&#x27;s southern border is defined by the Ohio River. Ohio&#x27;s neighbors are Pennsylvania to the east, Michigan to the northwest, Lake Erie to the north, Indiana to the west, Kentucky on the south, and West Virginia on the southeast. Ohio&#x27;s borders were defined by metes and bounds in the Enabling Act of 1802 as follows:
Ohio is bounded by the Ohio River, but nearly all of the river belongs to Kentucky and West Virginia. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, based on the wording of the cessation of territory by Virginia (which at the time included what is now Kentucky and West Virginia), the boundary between Ohio and Kentucky (and, by implication, West Virginia) is the northern low-water mark of the river as it existed in 1792. Ohio has only that portion of the river between the river&#x27;s 1792 low-water mark and the present high-water mark. The border with Michigan has also changed, as a result of the Toledo War, to angle slightly northeast to the north shore of the mouth of the Maumee River.

Much of Ohio features glaciated till plains, with an exceptionally flat area in the northwest being known as the Great Black Swamp. This glaciated region in the northwest and central state is bordered to the east and southeast first by a belt known as the glaciated Allegheny Plateau, and then by another belt known as the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau. Most of Ohio is of low relief, but the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau features rugged hills and forests.

Ohio&#x27;s rugged southeastern quadrant, stretching in an outward bow-like arc along the Ohio River from the West Virginia Panhandle to the outskirts of Cincinnati, forms a distinct socioeconomic unit. Geologically similar to parts of West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, this area&#x27;s coal mining legacy, dependence on small pockets of old manufacturing establishments, and distinctive regional dialect set this section off from the rest of the state. In 1965, Congress passed the Appalachian Regional Development Act, an attempt to &quot;address the persistent poverty and growing economic despair of the Appalachian Region&quot;. It defines 29 Ohio counties as part of Appalachia. While 1/3 of Ohio&#x27;s land mass is part of the federally defined Appalachian region, only 12.8% of Ohioans live there (1.476 million people.)

Significant Ohio rivers include the Cuyahoga River, Great Miami River, Maumee River, Muskingum River, and Scioto River. The rivers in northern Ohio drain into the northern Atlantic Ocean via Lake Erie and the St. Lawrence River, and those in southern Ohio drain into the Gulf of Mexico via the Ohio River and the Mississippi. Ohio also includes Bass Islands and Kelleys Island. Grand Lake St. Marys in the west-central part of the state was constructed as a supply of water for canals in the canal-building era of 1820–1850. This body of water, over , was the largest artificial lake in the world when completed in 1845. Ohio&#x27;s canal-building projects were not the economic fiasco that similar efforts were in other states. Some cities, such as Dayton, owe their industrial emergence to their location on canals, and as late as 1910 interior canals carried much of the bulk freight of the state.

Areas under the protection of the National Park Service include Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Hopewell Culture National Historical Park, Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, First Ladies National Historic Site, James A. Garfield National Historic Site, William Howard Taft National Historic Site, and the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument and Perry&#x27;s Victory and International Peace Memorial.

===Fauna===

Ohio has wide variety of unique animal species. Rare and endangered species include the Eastern Hellbender, which is found in the Southeastern Appalachian region of Ohio and is classified as state endangered. The Eastern Hellbender is the 3rd largest amphibian in the world, and can grow up to 27 inches in length. It is fully aquatic and breathes almost entirely through its skin. Due to this, it is only found in pristine, cool, clear, fast flowing streams and rivers. It is highly threatened by habitat loss, water pollution, and sedimentation due to logging and other human activities.

===Climate===
The climate of Ohio is a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa/Dfb&quot;) throughout most of the state, except in the extreme southern counties of Ohio&#x27;s Bluegrass region section, which are located on the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and Upland South region of the United States. Summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state, while winters generally range from cool to cold. Precipitation in Ohio is moderate year-round. Severe weather is not uncommon in the state, although there are typically fewer tornado reports in Ohio than in states located in what is known as the Tornado Alley. Severe lake effect snowstorms are also not uncommon on the southeast shore of Lake Erie, which is located in an area designated as the Snowbelt.

Although predominantly not in a subtropical climate, some warmer-climate flora and fauna do reach well into Ohio. For instance, some trees with more southern ranges, such as the blackjack oak, &quot;Quercus marilandica&quot;, are found at their northernmost in Ohio just north of the Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to a continental climate, several plants such as the Southern magnolia &quot;(Magnolia grandiflora)&quot;, Albizia julibrissin (mimosa), Crape Myrtle, and even the occasional Needle Palm are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the Bluegrass region of Ohio; but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the state. This interesting change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on Interstate 75 from Cincinnati to Toledo; the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati&#x27;s common wall lizard, one of the few examples of permanent &quot;subtropical&quot; fauna in Ohio.

The worst weather disaster in Ohio history occurred along the Great Miami River in 1913. Known as the Great Dayton Flood, the entire Miami River watershed flooded, including the downtown business district of Dayton. As a result, the Miami Conservancy District was created as the first major floodplain engineering project in Ohio and the United States.

The highest recorded temperature was , near Gallipolis on July 21, 1934. The lowest recorded temperature was , at Milligan on February 10, 1899, during the Great Blizzard of 1899.

====Earthquakes====
Although few have registered as noticeable to the average resident, more than 200 earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.0 or higher have occurred in Ohio since 1776. The Western Ohio Seismic Zone and a portion of the Southern Great Lakes Seismic Zone are located in the state, and numerous faults lie under the surface.

The most substantial known earthquake in Ohio history was the Anna (Shelby County) earthquake, which occurred on March 9, 1937. It was centered in western Ohio, with a magnitude of 5.4, and was of intensity VIII.

Other significant earthquakes in Ohio include: one of magnitude 4.8 near Lima on September 19, 1884; one of magnitude 4.2 near Portsmouth on May 17, 1901; and one of 5.0 in LeRoy Township in Lake County on January 31, 1986, which continued to trigger 13 aftershocks of magnitude 0.5 to 2.4 for two months.

Notable Ohio earthquakes in the 21st century include one occurring on December 31, 2011, approximately northwest of Youngstown, and one occurring on June 10, 2019, approximately north-northwest of Eastlake under Lake Erie; both registered a 4.0 magnitude.

===Cities===

There are 13 metropolitan statistical areas in Ohio, anchored by 16 cities, as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Additionally, 30 Ohio cities function as centers of micropolitan statistical areas, urban clusters smaller than that of metropolitan areas. Ohio&#x27;s three largest cities are Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati.

Columbus is the capital of the state, near its geographic center, and is well known for Ohio State University. In 2019, the city had six corporations named to the U.S. Fortune 500 list: Alliance Data, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, American Electric Power, L Brands, Huntington Bancshares, and Cardinal Health in suburban Dublin. Other major employers include hospitals (among others, Wexner Medical Center and Nationwide Children&#x27;s Hospital), high tech research and development including the Battelle Memorial Institute, information-based companies such as OCLC and Chemical Abstracts Service, manufacturer Worthington Industries, and financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase and Huntington Bancshares. Fast food chains Wendy&#x27;s and White Castle are also headquartered in Columbus.

Located in Northeast Ohio along the Lake Erie shore, Cleveland is characterized by its New England heritage, ethnic immigrant cultures, and history as a major American manufacturing and healthcare center. It anchors the Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area, of which the industrial cities of Akron and Canton are constituent parts. Mansfield, Sandusky and Youngstown are also major cities in the region. Northeast Ohio is known for major industrial companies Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Timken, top-ranked colleges Case Western Reserve University, Oberlin College, and Kent State University, the Cleveland Clinic, and cultural attractions including the Cleveland Museum of Art, Big Five member Cleveland Orchestra, Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Playhouse Square, the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Cincinnati anchors Southwest Ohio and the Cincinnati metropolitan area, which also encompasses counties in Kentucky and Indiana. The metropolitan area is home to Miami University and the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati Union Terminal, Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, and various Fortune 500 companies, including Procter &amp; Gamble, Kroger, Macy&#x27;s, Inc., and Fifth Third Bank. Dayton and Springfield are in the Miami Valley, which is home to the University of Dayton, the Dayton Ballet, and the extensive Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

Toledo and Lima are the major cities in Northwest Ohio, an area known for its glass-making industry. It is home to Owens Corning and Owens-Illinois, two Fortune 500 corporations.

Steubenville is the only metropolitan city in Appalachian Ohio, a region known for its mixed mesophytic forests. Other metropolitan areas that contain cities in Ohio but are primarily in other states include the Huntington, West Virginia and Wheeling, West Virginia areas. Ohio is the US state with the highest number of cities with the same name as UK cities.

==Demographics==
===Population===
From just over 45,000 residents in 1800, Ohio&#x27;s population grew faster than 10% per decade (except for the 1940 census) until the 1970 census, which recorded just over 10.65 million Ohioans. Growth then slowed for the next four decades. The United States Census Bureau counted 11,808,848 in the 2020 census, a 2.4% increase since the 2010 United States census. Ohio&#x27;s population growth lags that of the entire United States, and whites are found in a greater density than the U.S. average. , Ohio&#x27;s center of population is located in Morrow County, in the county seat of Mount Gilead. This is approximately south and west of Ohio&#x27;s population center in 1990.
As of 2011, 27.6% of Ohio&#x27;s children under the age of 1 belonged to minority groups. Approximately 6.2% of Ohio&#x27;s population was under five years of age, 23.7% under 18 years of age, and 14.1% were 65 or older; females made up an estimated 51.2% of the population.

According to HUD&#x27;s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 10,654 homeless people in Ohio.

===Birth data===
&quot;Note: Births in table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.&quot;
* Since 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one &quot;Hispanic&quot; group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.

===Ancestry===

In 2010, there were 469,700 foreign-born residents in Ohio, corresponding to 4.1% of the total population. Of these, 229,049 (2.0%) were naturalized U.S. citizens and 240,699 (2.1%) were not. The largest groups were: Mexico (54,166), India (50,256), China (34,901), Germany (19,219), Philippines (16,410), United Kingdom (15,917), Canada (14,223), Russia (11,763), South Korea (11,307), and Ukraine (10,681). Though predominantly white, Ohio has large black populations in all major metropolitan areas throughout the state, Ohio has a significant Hispanic population made up of Mexicans in Toledo and Columbus, and Puerto Ricans in Cleveland and Columbus, and also has a significant and diverse Asian population in Columbus.

Numerically: 10,100,586 spoke English, 239,229 Spanish, 55,970 German, 38,990 Chinese, 33,125 Arabic, and 32,019 French. In addition, 59,881 spoke a Slavic language and 42,673 spoke another West Germanic language according to the 2010 census. Ohio also had the nation&#x27;s largest population of Slovene speakers, second largest of Slovak speakers, second largest of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) speakers, and the third largest of Serbian speakers.

===Religion===
According to Public Religion Research Institute&#x27;s 2021 &quot;American Values Survey&quot;, 64% of Ohioans identified as Christian. Specifically, 19% of Ohio&#x27;s population identified as Mainline Protestant, 17% as Evangelical Protestant, 7% as Historically Black Protestant, and 18% as Catholic. Roughly 30% of the population were unaffiliated with any religious body. Small minorities of Jews (2%), Hindus (1%), Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (&lt;1%), Muslims (&lt;1%), Buddhists (&lt;1%), Mormons (&lt;1%), and other faiths exist according to this study. Altogether, those identifying with a religion or spiritual tradition were 70% of the state&#x27;s population.

Per the Association of Religion Data Archives&#x27;s (ARDA) 2020 study, Christianity remained the predominant religion. Non-denominational Christianity, numbering 1,411,863, were the largest Protestant cohort, although Catholicism remained the single-largest denomination with 1,820,233 adherents. According to the ARDA, in 2010 the largest Christian denominations by adherents were the Catholic Church with 1,992,567; the United Methodist Church with 496,232; the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 223,253, the Southern Baptist Convention with 171,000, the Christian Churches and Churches of Christ with 141,311, the United Church of Christ with 118,000, and the Presbyterian Church (USA) with 110,000. With about 80,000 adherents in 2020, Ohio had the second largest Amish population of all U.S. states, only behind neighboring Pennsylvania.

According to a Pew Forum poll in 2014, a majority of Ohioans, 56%, felt religion was &quot;very important&quot;, 25% that it was &quot;somewhat important&quot;, and 19% that religion was &quot;not too important/not important at all&quot;. Among them, 38% of Ohioans indicate that they attend religious services at least once weekly, 32% occasionally, and 30% seldom or never.

==Economy==


According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the total number of people employed in 2016 was 4,790,178. The total number of unique employer establishments was 252,201, while the total number of non-employer establishments was 785,833. In 2010, Ohio was ranked second in the country for best business climate by Site Selection magazine, based on a business-activity database. The state has also won three consecutive Governor&#x27;s Cup awards from the magazine, based on business growth and developments. , Ohio&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) was $626 billion. This ranks Ohio&#x27;s economy as the seventh-largest among all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

===Cuisine===

Buckeyes are a variation of standard peanut butter cups popular in Ohio. Coated in chocolate with a partially exposed center of peanut butter fudge, the candy resembles the appearance of the nut that grows on the state tree, commonly known as the buckeye. The Klondike bar originated in Mansfield in 1922. Dum Dums lollipops were originally produced in Bellevue, Ohio in 1924, and have been made by Spangler Candy Company in Bryan, Ohio since 1953.

Cincinnati-style chili is a Greek-inspired meat sauce used as a topping for spaghetti or hot dogs. Additionally, red beans, chopped onions, and shredded cheese are offered as extra toppings referred to as &quot;ways.&quot; German immigrants in Cincinnati invented goetta, a breakfast sausage made of meat scraps, spices, and oats. It is typically eaten fried.

The Polish Boy, “the signature sandwich of Cleveland”, is a kielbasa sausage topped with coleslaw, French fries, and barbecue sauce and served on a bun.

===Sports===
====Professional sports====
Ohio is home to eight professional sports teams across the five different major leagues in the United States. Current teams include the Cincinnati Reds and Cleveland Guardians of Major League Baseball, the Columbus Crew and FC Cincinnati of Major League Soccer, the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association, the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns of the National Football League, and the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League.

Ohio has brought home seven World Series titles (Reds 1919, 1940, 1975, 1976, 1990; Indians 1920, 1948), three MLS Cups (Crew 2008, 2020, 2023), one NBA Championship (Cavaliers 2016), and nine NFL Championships (Pros 1920; Bulldogs 1922, 1923, 1924; Rams 1945; Browns 1950, 1954, 1955, 1964). Despite this success in the NFL in the first half of the 20th century, no Ohio team has won the Super Bowl since its inception in 1967. No Ohio team has made an appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals.

Ohio played a central role in the development of both Major League Baseball and the National Football League. Baseball&#x27;s first fully professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869, were organized in Ohio. An informal early-20th-century American football association, the Ohio League, was the direct predecessor of the modern NFL, although neither of Ohio&#x27;s modern NFL franchises trace their roots to an Ohio League club. The NFL itself was founded in Canton in 1920 as the American Professional Football Conference. The first official game occurred on October 3, 1920, when the Dayton Triangles beat the Columbus Panhandles 14–0 in Dayton. Canton was enshrined as the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.

On a smaller scale, Ohio hosts minor league baseball, arena football, indoor football, mid-level hockey, and lower division soccer.

====Individual sports====
The Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course has hosted several auto racing championships, including CART World Series, IndyCar Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series, Can-Am, Formula 5000, IMSA GT Championship, American Le Mans Series and Rolex Sports Car Series. The Grand Prix of Cleveland also hosted CART races from 1982 to 2007. The Eldora Speedway is a major dirt oval that hosts NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, World of Outlaws Sprint Cars and USAC Silver Crown Series races.

Ohio hosts two PGA Tour events, the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and Memorial Tournament. The Cincinnati Open is an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and WTA 1000 tennis tournament.

====College sports====

Ohio has eight NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision college football teams, divided among three different conferences. It has also experienced considerable success in the secondary and tertiary tiers of college football divisions.

There are two programs in the Power Five conferences; the Ohio State Buckeyes of the Big Ten Conference and the Cincinnati Bearcats of the Big 12 Conference. The Ohio State Buckeyes football team is second in all-time winning percentage, with a 977–335–53 overall record and a 30–29 bowl record as of 2024. The program has produced seven Heisman Trophy winners, forty-one conference titles, and nine undisputed national championships. The men&#x27;s basketball program has appeared in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament 27 times.

The Cincinnati Bearcats men&#x27;s basketball team has over 1,800 wins and 33 March Madness appearances, whilst the Bearcats football team became the first so-called &quot;Group of Five&quot; team to qualify to the College Football Playoff in 2022.

In the Group of Five conferences, six teams are represented in the Mid-American Conference: the Akron Zips, Bowling Green Falcons, Kent State Golden Flashes, Miami RedHawks, Ohio Bobcats and the Toledo Rockets. The MAC headquarters are in Cleveland. The Cincinnati–Miami rivalry game has been played in southwest Ohio every year since 1888 and is the oldest current non-conference NCAA football rivalry. Other Division I schools, either part of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision or not fielding in football include the Cleveland State Vikings, Xavier Musketeers, Wright State Raiders, and Youngstown State Penguins. Xavier&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball has performed particularly well, with 27 March Madness appearances. Youngstown State&#x27;s football has the third most NCAA Division I Football Championship wins, with 3.

There are 12 NCAA Division II universities and 22 NCAA Division III universities in Ohio.

==Government and politics==

===State government===

The state government of Ohio consists of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

The executive branch is headed by the governor of Ohio. The current governor is Mike DeWine since 2019, a member of the Republican Party. A lieutenant governor succeeds the governor in the event of any removal from office, and performs any duties assigned by the governor. The current lieutenant governor is Jim Tressel. The other elected constitutional offices in the executive branch are the secretary of state (Frank LaRose), auditor (Keith Faber), treasurer (Robert Sprague), and attorney general (Dave Yost). There are 21 state administrative departments in the executive branch.

The Ohio General Assembly is a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Senate is composed of 33 districts, each of which is represented by one senator. Each senator represents approximately 330,000 constituents. The House of Representatives has 99 members. The Republican Party is the majority party in both houses as of the 2022 election cycle.

In order to be enacted into law, a bill must be adopted by both houses of the General Assembly and signed by the governor. If the governor vetoes a bill, the General Assembly can override the veto with a three-fifths supermajority of both houses. A bill will also become a law if the governor fails to sign or veto it within 10 days of its being presented. The session laws are published in the official &quot;Law of Ohio&quot;. These in turn have been codified in the &quot;Ohio Revised Code&quot;. The General Assembly, with the approval of the governor, draws the U.S. congressional district lines for Ohio&#x27;s 16 seats in the United States House of Representatives. The Ohio Apportionment Board draws state legislative district lines in Ohio.

There are three levels of the Ohio state judiciary. The lowest is the court of common pleas: each county maintains its own constitutionally mandated court of common pleas, which maintain jurisdiction over &quot;all justiciable matters&quot;. The intermediate-level court system is the district court system. Twelve courts of appeals exist, each retaining jurisdiction over appeals from common pleas, municipal, and county courts in a set geographical area. A case heard in this system is decided by a three-judge panel, and each judge is elected.

The state&#x27;s highest-ranking court is the Ohio Supreme Court. A seven-justice panel composes the court, which, by its own discretion, hears appeals from the courts of appeals, and retains original jurisdiction over limited matters.

===Local government===
There are also several levels of local government in Ohio: counties, municipalities (cities and villages), townships, special districts, and school districts.

Ohio is divided into 88 counties. Ohio law defines a structure for county government, although they may adopt charters for home rule. Summit County and Cuyahoga County have chosen an alternate form of government. The other counties have a government with a three-member board of county commissioners, a sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, clerk of the court of common pleas prosecutor, engineer, and recorder.

There are two kinds of incorporated municipalities, 251 cities and 681 villages. If a municipality has five thousand or more residents as of the last United States Census it is a city, otherwise it is a village. Municipalities have full home rule powers, may adopt a charter, ordinances and resolutions for self-government. Each municipality chooses its own form of government, but most have elected mayors and city councils or city commissions. City governments provide much more extensive services than county governments, such as police forces and paid (as opposed to volunteer) fire departments.

The entire area of the state is encompassed by townships. When the boundaries of a township are coterminous with the boundaries of a city or village, the township ceases to exist as a separate government (called a paper township). Townships are governed by a three-member board of township trustees. Townships may have limited home rule powers.

There are more than 600 city, local, and exempted village school districts providing K-12 education in Ohio, as well as about four dozen joint vocation school districts, which are separate from the K-12 districts. Each city school district, local school district, or exempted village school district is governed by an elected board of education. A school district previously under state supervision (municipal school district) may be governed by a board whose members either are elected or appointed by the mayor of the municipality containing the greatest portion of the district&#x27;s area.

===Politics===


Historian R. Douglas Hurt asserts that not since Virginia &quot;had a state made such a mark on national political affairs&quot; as Ohio. &quot;The Economist&quot; notes that &quot;This slice of the mid-west contains a bit of everything American—part north-eastern and part southern, part urban and part rural, part hardscrabble poverty and part booming suburb&quot;.

Ohio is considered a moderately Republican-leaning state politically. It had been a swing state in the late 20th and early 21st centuries; this status was called into question after the state voted for Republican Donald Trump at larger margins than the nation as a whole in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential elections. It is also considered a bellwether state. Since 1896, Ohio has had only three misses in the general election (1944, 1960, 2020) and had the longest perfect streak of any state, voting for the winning presidential candidate in each election from 1964 to 2016 and in 34 of the 39 held since the American Civil War. No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio.

As of 2024, there are more than 8 million registered Ohioan voters, of which over 70% are not affiliated with any political party. They are disproportionate in age, with a million more over 65 than there are 18- to 24-year-olds. Since the 2010 midterm elections, Ohio&#x27;s voter demographic has leaned towards the Republican Party.

The governor, Mike DeWine, is Republican, as are all other non-judicial statewide elected officials. In the Ohio State Senate the Republicans are the majority, 25–8, and in the Ohio House of Representatives the Republicans control the delegation 64–35.

Following the 2020 census, Ohio has 15 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. As of the 2024 election cycle, ten federal representatives are Republicans while five are Democrats. Marcy Kaptur (D-09) is the most senior member of the Ohio delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives. The senior U.S. senator is Bernie Moreno and the junior is Jon Husted. Both are Republicans.

In 2023, Ohioans approved a constitutional amendment strengthening abortion rights.

===&quot;Mother of presidents&quot;===
Six U.S. presidents hailed from Ohio at the time of their elections, giving rise to its nickname &quot;mother of presidents&quot;, a sobriquet it shares with Virginia. It is also termed &quot;modern mother of presidents&quot;, in contrast to Virginia&#x27;s status as the origin of presidents earlier in American history. Virginia-born William Henry Harrison lived much of his life in North Bend, Ohio, was elected from the state and is also buried there. The other five presidents are Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, William Howard Taft and Warren G. Harding. Seven presidents were born in Ohio, making it second to Virginia&#x27;s eight; in addition to the aforementioned five, Ulysses S. Grant was elected from Illinois and Benjamin Harrison was elected from Indiana.

===Allegations of voter suppression===
In a 2020 study, Ohio was ranked as the 17th hardest state for citizens to vote in. Since 1994, the state has had a policy of purging infrequent voters from its rolls. In April 2016, a lawsuit was filed, challenging this policy on the grounds that it violated the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002. In June, the federal district court ruled for the plaintiffs and entered a preliminary injunction applicable only to the November 2016 election. The preliminary injunction was upheld in September by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Had it not been upheld, thousands of voters would have been purged from the rolls just a few weeks before the election.

==Education==


Ohio&#x27;s system of public education is outlined in Article VI of the state constitution, and in Title XXXIII of the Ohio Revised Code. Substantively, Ohio&#x27;s system is similar to those found in other states. At the State level, the Ohio Department of Education governs primary and secondary educational institutions. At the municipal level, there are approximately 700 school districts statewide. The Ohio Board of Regents coordinates and assists with Ohio&#x27;s institutions of higher education.

Ohio is home to several public and private institutions of higher learning. Prior to statehood, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 included a provision to establish an institution of higher education in the region, resulting in the establishment of Ohio University in 1804 as Ohio&#x27;s first college. The University System of Ohio includes all of Ohio&#x27;s public institutions of higher education. It includes 14 four-year research universities, 24 branch and regional campuses, and 23 community colleges and technical colleges. Ohio State University is the largest of the system, with over 60,000 students at its main campus in Columbus.

Kenyon College is the state&#x27;s oldest private liberal arts college, established in 1824 by an Episcopal bishop to train clergy on the Ohio frontier. Oberlin College, established in 1833, was among the earliest colleges in the US to admit African Americans in 1835, and became the first to admit women in 1837.

The Carnegie Foundation classifies five of the state&#x27;s institutions as tier 1 research universities: Case Western Reserve University, Kent State University, Ohio State University, Ohio University, and the University of Cincinnati.

===Libraries===
Ohio is home to some of the nation&#x27;s highest-ranked public libraries. Major metropolitan public library systems include the Cleveland Public Library, the Cuyahoga County Public Library, the Cincinnati and Hamilton County Public Library, and the Columbus Metropolitan Library. The Ohio Public Library Information Network provides Ohio residents with internet access to their 251 public libraries. It also provides Ohioans with free home access to high-quality, subscription research databases.

The OhioLINK library consortium provides Ohio&#x27;s college and university libraries with mutual access to their collections. The program allows researchers access to books and other media that might not be otherwise available. CLEVNET, another major library consortium, is based at the Cleveland Public Library and includes 47 public library systems in Northeast Ohio.

==Transportation==

===Roads===

Many major east–west transportation corridors go through Ohio. One of those pioneer routes, known in the early 20th century as &quot;Main Market Route 3&quot;, was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic Lincoln Highway which was the first road across America, connecting New York City to San Francisco. In Ohio, the Lincoln Highway linked many towns and cities together, including Canton, Mansfield, Wooster, Lima, and Van Wert. The Lincoln Highway&#x27;s arrival in Ohio was a major influence on the state&#x27;s development. Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1926, the Lincoln Highway through Ohio became U.S. Route 30.

Ohio is home to of the National Road, now U.S. Route 40.

Ohio has a highly developed network of roads and interstate highways. Major east-west through routes include the Ohio Turnpike (I-80/I-90) in the north, I-76 through Akron to Pennsylvania, I-70 through Columbus and Dayton, and the Appalachian Highway (State Route 32) running from West Virginia to Cincinnati. Major north–south routes include I-75 in the west through Toledo, Dayton, and Cincinnati, I-71 through the middle of the state from Cleveland through Columbus and Cincinnati into Kentucky, and I-77 in the eastern part of the state from Cleveland through Akron, Canton, New Philadelphia and Marietta south into West Virginia. Interstate 75 between Cincinnati and Dayton is one of Ohio&#x27;s most heavily traveled sections of interstate.

===Trails===
Ohio has a highly developed network of signed state bicycle routes. Many of them follow rail trails, with conversion ongoing. The Ohio to Erie Trail (route 1) connects Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland. U.S. Bicycle Route 50 traverses Ohio from Steubenville to the Indiana state line outside Richmond.

Ohio has several long-distance hiking trails, the most prominent of which is the Buckeye Trail, which extends in a loop around the state. Part of it is on roads and part on wooded trail. Additionally, the North Country Trail (the longest of the 11 National Scenic Trails authorized by Congress) and the American Discovery Trail (a system of recreational trails and roads that collectively form a coast-to-coast route across the mid-tier of the United States) pass through Ohio. Much of these two trails coincide with the Buckeye Trail.

===Rail===
Ohio has an extensive rail network, though today most lines carry only freight traffic. Three Class I freight railroads operate in Ohio: CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Canadian National Railway. Many local freight carriers also exist in the state.

Amtrak, the national passenger railroad, operates three long-distance rail routes through Ohio. The &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; serves , , , , and . The &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; stops in those cities as well as in . The &quot;Cardinal&quot; serves Cincinnati Union Terminal. From Ohio, passengers can ride directly to , , Boston, , , , , and dozens of destinations in-between.

Columbus is the largest city in the U.S. with no passenger rail. Its Union Station was last served in 1979 by the &quot;National Limited.&quot;

Ohio is home to several scenic railways and museums, including the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad through Cuyahoga Valley National Park, the Age of Steam Roundhouse museum, and the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway near Hocking Hills State Park.

===Transit===

Mass transit exists in many forms in Ohio cities, primarily through bus systems. The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) operates the RTA Rapid Transit system, which consists of one heavy rail line, three light rail lines, and three bus rapid transit lines. Cincinnati is served by the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) bus network as well as a streetcar line, the Cincinnati Bell Connector. Other major transit agencies in Ohio include the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) serving Columbus and the Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority (GDRTA) serving Dayton.

===Air travel===

Ohio has four international airports, four commercial, and two military. The four international include Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, John Glenn Columbus International Airport, Dayton International Airport, and Rickenbacker International Airport (one of two military airfields). The other military airfield is Wright Patterson Air Force Base which is one of the largest Air Force bases in the United States. Other major airports are in Toledo and Akron. Cincinnati&#x27;s main airport, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, is in Hebron, Kentucky, and therefore is not included in Ohio airport lists.

<text>Some chemical authorities define an organic compound as a chemical compound that contains a carbon–hydrogen or carbon–carbon bond; others consider an organic compound to be any chemical compound that contains carbon. For example, carbon-containing compounds such as alkanes (e.g. methane ) and its derivatives are universally considered organic, but many others are sometimes considered inorganic, such as halides of carbon without carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bonds (e.g. carbon tetrachloride ), and certain compounds of carbon with nitrogen and oxygen (e.g. cyanide ion , hydrogen cyanide , chloroformic acid , carbon dioxide , and carbonate ion ).

Due to carbon&#x27;s ability to catenate (form chains with other carbon atoms), millions of organic compounds are known. The study of the properties, reactions, and syntheses of organic compounds comprise the discipline known as organic chemistry. For historical reasons, a few classes of carbon-containing compounds (e.g., carbonate salts and cyanide salts), along with a few other exceptions (e.g., carbon dioxide, and even hydrogen cyanide despite the fact it contains a carbon-hydrogen bond), are generally considered inorganic. Other than those just named, little consensus exists among chemists on precisely which carbon-containing compounds are excluded, making any rigorous definition of an organic compound elusive.

Although organic compounds make up only a small percentage of Earth&#x27;s crust, they are of central importance because all known life is based on organic compounds. Living things incorporate inorganic carbon compounds into organic compounds through a network of processes (the carbon cycle) that begins with the conversion of carbon dioxide and a hydrogen source like water into simple sugars and other organic molecules by autotrophic organisms using light (photosynthesis) or other sources of energy. Most synthetically-produced organic compounds are ultimately derived from petrochemicals consisting mainly of hydrocarbons, which are themselves formed from the high pressure and temperature degradation of organic matter underground over geological timescales. This ultimate derivation notwithstanding, organic compounds are no longer defined as compounds originating in living things, as they were historically.

In chemical nomenclature, an organyl group, frequently represented by the letter R, refers to any monovalent substituent whose open valence is on a carbon atom.

==Definition==
For historical reasons discussed below, a few types of carbon-containing compounds, such as carbides, carbonates (excluding carbonate esters), simple oxides of carbon (for example, CO and ) and cyanides are generally considered inorganic compounds. Different forms (allotropes) of pure carbon, such as diamond, graphite, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes are also excluded because they are simple substances composed of a single element and so not generally considered chemical compounds. The word &quot;organic&quot; in this context does not mean &quot;natural&quot;.

==History==

===Vitalism===

Vitalism was a widespread conception that substances found in organic nature are formed from the chemical elements by the action of a &quot;vital force&quot; or &quot;life-force&quot; (&quot;vis vitalis&quot;) that only living organisms possess.

In the 1810s, Jöns Jacob Berzelius argued that a regulative force must exist within living bodies. Berzelius also contended that compounds could be distinguished by whether they required any organisms in their synthesis (organic compounds) or whether they did not (inorganic compounds). Vitalism taught that formation of these &quot;organic&quot; compounds were fundamentally different from the &quot;inorganic&quot; compounds that could be obtained from the elements by chemical manipulations in laboratories.

Vitalism survived for a short period after the formulation of modern ideas about the atomic theory and chemical elements. It first came under question in 1824, when Friedrich Wöhler synthesized oxalic acid, a compound known to occur only in living organisms, from cyanogen. A further experiment was Wöhler&#x27;s 1828 synthesis of urea from the inorganic salts potassium cyanate and ammonium sulfate. Urea had long been considered an &quot;organic&quot; compound, as it was known to occur only in the urine of living organisms. Wöhler&#x27;s experiments were followed by many others, in which increasingly complex &quot;organic&quot; substances were produced from &quot;inorganic&quot; ones without the involvement of any living organism, thus disproving vitalism.

===Modern classification and ambiguities===
Although vitalism has been discredited, scientific nomenclature retains the distinction between &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;inorganic&quot; compounds. The modern meaning of &quot;organic compound&quot; is any compound that contains a significant amount of carbon—even though many of the organic compounds known today have no connection to any substance found in living organisms. The term &quot;carbogenic&quot; has been proposed by E. J. Corey as a modern alternative to &quot;organic&quot;, but this neologism remains relatively obscure.

The organic compound -isoleucine molecule presents some features typical of organic compounds: carbon–carbon bonds, carbon–hydrogen bonds, as well as covalent bonds from carbon to oxygen and to nitrogen.

As described in detail below, any definition of organic compound that uses simple, broadly-applicable criteria turns out to be unsatisfactory, to varying degrees. The modern, commonly accepted definition of organic compound essentially amounts to any carbon-containing compound, excluding several classes of substances traditionally considered &quot;inorganic&quot;. The list of substances so excluded varies from author to author. Still, it is generally agreed upon that there are (at least) a few carbon-containing compounds that should not be considered organic. For instance, almost all authorities would require the exclusion of alloys that contain carbon, including steel (which contains cementite, ), as well as other metal and semimetal carbides (including &quot;ionic&quot; carbides, e.g,  and  and &quot;covalent&quot; carbides, e.g.  and SiC, and graphite intercalation compounds, e.g. ). Other compounds and materials that are considered &#x27;inorganic&#x27; by most authorities include: metal carbonates, simple oxides of carbon (CO, , and arguably, ), the allotropes of carbon, cyanide derivatives not containing an organic residue (e.g., KCN, , BrCN, cyanate anion , etc.), and heavier analogs thereof (e.g., cyaphide anion , , COS; although carbon disulfide is often classed as an &quot;organic&quot; solvent). Halides of carbon without hydrogen (e.g.,  and ), phosgene (), carboranes, metal carbonyls (e.g., nickel tetracarbonyl), mellitic anhydride (), and other exotic oxocarbons are also considered inorganic by some authorities.

Nickel tetracarbonyl () and other metal carbonyls are often volatile liquids, like many organic compounds, yet they contain only carbon bonded to a transition metal and to oxygen, and are often prepared directly from metal and carbon monoxide. Nickel tetracarbonyl is typically classified as an &quot;organometallic compound&quot; as it satisfies the broad definition that organometallic chemistry covers all compounds that contain at least one carbon to metal covalent bond; it is unknown whether organometallic compounds form a subset of organic compounds. For example, the evidence of covalent Fe-C bonding in cementite, a major component of steel, places it within this broad definition of organometallic, yet steel and other carbon-containing alloys are seldom regarded as organic compounds. Thus, it is unclear whether the definition of organometallic should be narrowed, whether these considerations imply that organometallic compounds are not necessarily organic, or both.

Metal complexes with organic ligands but no carbon-metal bonds (e.g., ) are not considered organometallic; instead, they are called metal-organic compounds (and might be considered organic).

The relatively narrow definition of organic compounds as those containing C-H bonds excludes compounds that are (historically and practically) considered organic. Neither urea nor oxalic acid are organic by this definition, yet they were two key compounds in the vitalism debate. However, the IUPAC Blue Book on organic nomenclature specifically mentions urea and oxalic acid as organic compounds. Other compounds lacking C-H bonds but traditionally considered organic include benzenehexol, mesoxalic acid, and carbon tetrachloride. Mellitic acid, which contains no C-H bonds, is considered a possible organic compound in Martian soil. Terrestrially, it, and its anhydride, mellitic anhydride, are associated with the mineral mellite ().

A slightly broader definition of the organic compound includes all compounds bearing C-H or C-C bonds. This would still exclude urea. Moreover, this definition still leads to somewhat arbitrary divisions in sets of carbon-halogen compounds. For example,  and  would be considered by this rule to be &quot;inorganic&quot;, whereas , , and  would be organic, though these compounds share many physical and chemical properties.

==Classification==
Organic compounds may be classified in a variety of ways. One major distinction is between natural and synthetic compounds. Organic compounds can also be classified or subdivided by the presence of heteroatoms, e.g., organometallic compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a metal, and organophosphorus compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a phosphorus.

Another distinction, based on the size of organic compounds, distinguishes between small molecules and polymers.

===Natural compounds===

Natural compounds refer to those that are produced by plants or animals. Many of these are still extracted from natural sources because they would be more expensive to produce artificially. Examples include most sugars, some alkaloids and terpenoids, certain nutrients such as vitamin B12, and, in general, those natural products with large or stereoisometrically complicated molecules present in reasonable concentrations in living organisms.

Further compounds of prime importance in biochemistry are antigens, carbohydrates, enzymes, hormones, lipids and fatty acids, neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, proteins, peptides and amino acids, lectins, vitamins, and fats and oils.

===Synthetic compounds===
Compounds that are prepared by reaction of other compounds are known as &quot;synthetic&quot;. They may be either compounds that are already found in plants/animals or those artificial compounds that do not occur naturally.

Most polymers (a category that includes all plastics and rubbers) are organic synthetic or semi-synthetic compounds.

===Biotechnology===

Many organic compounds—two examples are ethanol and insulin—are manufactured industrially using organisms such as bacteria and yeast. Typically, the DNA of an organism is altered to express compounds not ordinarily produced by the organism. Many such biotechnology-engineered compounds did not previously exist in nature.

==Databases==
* The &quot;CAS&quot; database is the most comprehensive repository for data on organic compounds. The search tool &quot;SciFinder&quot; is offered.
* The &quot;Beilstein database&quot; contains information on 9.8 million substances, covers the scientific literature from 1771 to the present, and is today accessible via Reaxys. Structures and a large diversity of physical and chemical properties are available for each substance, with reference to original literature.
* &quot;PubChem&quot; contains 18.4 million entries on compounds and especially covers the field of medicinal chemistry.

A great number of more specialized databases exist for diverse branches of organic chemistry.

==Structure determination==

The main tools are proton and carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy, IR Spectroscopy, Mass spectrometry, UV/Vis Spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.

<doc id="22204" wikidata="Q103639" url="?curid=22204" title="Oligopoly">
<text>An oligopoly () is a market in which pricing control lies in the hands of a few sellers.

As a result of their significant market power, firms in oligopolistic markets can influence prices through manipulating the supply function. Firms in an oligopoly are mutually interdependent, as any action by one firm is expected to affect other firms in the market and evoke a reaction or consequential action. As a result, firms in oligopolistic markets often resort to collusion as means of maximising profits.

Nonetheless, in the presence of fierce competition among market participants, oligopolies may develop without collusion. This is a situation similar to perfect competition, where oligopolists have their own market structure. In this situation, each company in the oligopoly has a large share in the industry and plays a pivotal, unique role.

Many jurisdictions deem collusion to be illegal as it violates competition laws and is regarded as anti-competition behaviour. The EU competition law in Europe prohibits anti-competitive practices such as price-fixing and competitors manipulating market supply and trade. In the US, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission are tasked with stopping collusion&quot;.&quot; In Australia, the Federal Competition and Consumer Act 2010 details the prohibition and regulation of anti-competitive agreements and practices. Although aggressive, these laws typically only apply when firms engage in formal collusion, such as cartels. Corporations may often thus evade legal consequences through tacit collusion, as collusion can only be proven through direct communication between companies.

Within post-socialist economies, oligopolies may be particularly pronounced. For example in Armenia, where business elites enjoy oligopoly, 19% of the whole economy is monopolized, making it the most monopolized country in the region.

Many industries have been cited as oligopolistic, including civil aviation, electricity providers, the telecommunications sector, rail freight markets, food processing, funeral services, sugar refining, beer making, pulp and paper making, and automobile manufacturing.

== Types of oligopolies ==

=== Perfect and imperfect oligopolies ===
Perfect and imperfect oligopolies are often distinguished by the nature of the goods firms produce or trade in.

A perfect (sometimes called a &#x27;pure&#x27;) oligopoly is where the commodities produced by the firms are homogenous (i.e., identical or materially the same in nature) and the elasticity of substitute commodities is near infinite. Generally, where there are two homogenous products, a rational consumer&#x27;s preference between the products will be indifferent, assuming the products share common prices. Similarly, sellers will be relatively indifferent between purchase commitments in relation to homogenous products. In an oligopolistic market of a primary industry, such as agriculture or mining, commodities produced by oligopolistic enterprises will have strong homogeneity; as such, such markets are described as perfect oligopolies.

Imperfect (or &#x27;differentiated&#x27;) oligopolies, on the other hand, involve firms producing commodities which are heterogenous. Where companies in an industry need to offer a diverse range of products and services, such as in the manufacturing and service industries, such industries are subject to imperfect oligopoly.

=== Open and closed oligopolies ===
An open oligopoly market structure occurs where barriers to entry do not exist, and firms can freely enter the oligopolistic market. In contrast, a closed oligopoly is where there are prominent barriers to market entry which preclude other firms from easily entering the market. Entry barriers include high investment requirements, strong consumer loyalty for existing brands, regulatory hurdles and economies of scale. These barriers allow existing firms in the oligopoly market to maintain a certain price on commodities and services in order to maximise profits.

=== Collusive oligopolies ===
Collusion among firms in an oligopoly market structure occurs where there are express or tacit agreements between firms to follow a particular price structure in relation to particular products (for homogenous products) or particular transaction or product classes (for heterogeneous products). Colluding firms are able to maximise profits at a level above the normal market equilibrium.

Interdependence in oligopolies is reduced when firms collude, because there is a lessened need for firms to anticipate the actions of other firms in relation to prices. Collusion closes the gap in the asymmetry of information typically present in a market of competing firms.

One form of collusive oligopoly is a cartel, a monopolistic organisation and relationship formed by manufacturers who produce or sell a certain kind of goods in order to monopolise the market and obtain high profits by reaching an agreement on commodity price, output and market share allocation. However, the stability and effectiveness of a cartel are limited, and members tend to break from the alliance in order to gain short-term benefits.

=== Partial and full oligopoly ===
A full oligopoly is one in which a price leader is not present in the market, and where firms enjoy relatively similar market control. A partial oligopoly is one where a single firm dominates an industry through saturation of the market, producing a high percentage of total output and having large influence over market conditions. Partial oligopolies are able to price-make rather than price-take.

=== Tight and loose oligopoly ===
In a tight oligopoly, only a few firms dominate the market, and there is limited competition. A loose oligopoly, on the other hand, has many interdependent firms which often collude to maximise profits. Markets can be classified into tight and loose oligopolies using the four-firm concentration ratio, which measures the percentage market share of the top four firms in the industry. The higher the four-firm concentration ratio is, the less competitive the market is. When the four-firm concentration ration is higher than 60, the market can be classified as a tight oligopoly. A loose oligopoly occurs when the four-firm concentration is in the range of 40-60.

== Characteristics of oligopolies ==
Some characteristics of oligopolies include:
* Profit maximisation
* Price setting: Firms in an oligopoly market structure tend to set prices rather than adopt them.
* High barriers to entry and exit:&quot;&quot; Important barriers include government licenses, economies of scale, patents, access to expensive and complex technology, and strategic actions by incumbent firms designed to discourage or destroy nascent firms. Additional sources of barriers to entry often result from government regulation favouring existing firms.
* Few firms in the market: When there are few firms in the market, the actions of one firm can influence the actions of the others.
* Abnormal long-run profits: High barriers of entry prevent sideline firms from entering the market to capture excess profits. If the firms are colluding in the oligopoly, they can set the price at a high profit-maximising level.
* Perfect and imperfect knowledge: Oligopolies have perfect knowledge of their own cost and demand functions, but their inter-firm information may be incomplete. If firms in an oligopoly collude, information between firms then may become perfect. Buyers, however, only have imperfect knowledge as to price, cost, and product quality.
* Interdependence: A distinctive feature of oligopolies is interdependence. Oligopolistic firms must take into consideration the possible reactions of all competing firms and the firms&#x27; countermoves. Every oligopolistic company with strong commodity homogeneity in its industry is reluctant to raise or lower prices, as competing firms will be aware of a firm&#x27;s market actions and will respond appropriately. Anticipation among firms about potential counteractions leads to price rigidity, with firms usually only willing to adjust prices and quantities of output in accordance with a price leader. This high degree of interdependence stands in contrast with the lack of interdependence in other market structures. In a perfectly competitive market, there is zero interdependence because no firm is large enough to affect market prices. In a monopoly, there are no competitors to be concerned about. In a monopolistically-competitive market, each firm&#x27;s effects on market conditions are so negligible that they can be safely ignored by competitors.
* Non-price competition: Generally, the oligopolistic enterprise with the largest scale and lowest cost will become the price setter in this market. The price set by it will maximise its own interests, such that other small-scale enterprises may also benefit. Oligopolies tend to compete on terms other than price, as non-price competition, such as promotional efforts, is less risky. Along non-price dimensions, collusion is harder to sustain.

== Sources of oligopoly power ==

=== Economies of scale ===
Economies of scale occur where a firm&#x27;s average costs per unit of output decreases while the scale of the firm, or the output being produced by the firm, increases. Firms in an oligopoly who benefit from economies of scale have a distinct advantage over firms who do not. Their marginal costs are lower, such that the firm&#x27;s equilibrium at formula_1 would be higher. Economies of scale are seen prevalently when two firms in oligopolistic market agree to a merger, as it allows the firm to not only diversify their market but also increase in size and output production, with negligible relative increases in output costs. These sorts of mergers are typically seen when companies expand into large business groups by appreciating and increasing capital to buy smaller companies in the same markets, which consequently increases the profit margins of the business.

=== Collusion and price cutting ===
In a market with low entry barriers, price collusion between established sellers makes new sellers vulnerable to undercutting. Recognising this vulnerability, established sellers will reach a tacit understanding to raise entry barriers to prevent new companies from entering the market. Even if this requires cutting prices, all companies benefit because they reduce the risk of loss created by new competition. In other words, firms will lose less for deviation and thus have more incentive to undercut collusion prices when more join the market. The rate at which firms interact with one another will also affect the incentives for undercutting other firms; short-term rewards for undercutting competitors are short lived where interaction is frequent, as a degree of punishment can expected swiftly by other firms, but longer-lived where interaction is infrequent. Greater market transparency, for instance, would decrease collusion, as oligopolistic companies expect retaliation sooner where changes in their prices and quantity of sales are clear to their rivals.

=== Barriers to enter the market ===
Large capital investments required for entry, including intellectual property laws, certain network effects, absolute cost advantages, reputation, advertisement dominance, product differentiation, brand reliance, and others, all contribute to keeping existing firms in the market and precluding new firms from entering.

== Modeling oligopolies ==
There is no single model that describes the operation of an oligopolistic market. The variety and complexity of the models exist because numerous firms can compete on the basis of price, quantity, technological innovations, marketing, and reputation. However, there are a series of simplified models that attempt to describe market behavior under certain circumstances. Some of the better-known models are the dominant firm model, the Cournot–Nash model, the Bertrand model and the kinked demand model. As different industries have different characteristics, oligopoly models differ in their applicability within each industry.

=== Game theoretical models ===
With few sellers, each oligopolist is likely to be aware of the actions of their competition. According to game theory, the decisions of one firm influence, and are influenced by, the decisions of other firms. Strategic planning by oligopolists needs to take into account the likely responses of the other market participants. The following game-theoretical oligopoly models attempt to describe and predict the behaviour of oligopolies:
* Stackelberg&#x27;s duopoly. In this model, the firms move sequentially to determine their quantities (see Stackelberg competition).
* Cournot&#x27;s duopoly. In this model, the firms simultaneously choose quantities (see Cournot competition).
* Bertrand&#x27;s oligopoly. In this model, the firms simultaneously choose prices (see Bertrand competition).

One major difference between varying industries is capacity constraints. Both Cournot model and Bertrand model consist of the two-stage game; the Cournot model is more suitable for firms in industries that face capacity constraints, where firms set their quantity of production first, then set their prices. The Bertrand model is more applicable for industries with low capacity constraints, such as banking and insurance.

==== &quot;Cournot-Nash model&quot; ====
The Cournot–Nash model is the simplest oligopoly model. The model assumes that there are two equally positioned firms; the firms compete on the basis of quantity rather than price, and each firm makes decisions on the assumption that the other firm&#x27;s behaviour is unchanging. The market demand curve is assumed to be linear, and marginal costs constant.

In this model, the Nash equilibrium can be found by determining how each firm reacts to a change in the output of the other firm, and repeating this analysis until a point is reached where neither firm desires to act any differently, given their predictions of the other firm&#x27;s responsive behaviour.

The equilibrium is the intersection of the two firm&#x27;s &quot;reaction functions&quot;, which show how one firm reacts to the quantity choice of the other firm. The reaction function can be derived by calculating the first-order condition (FOC) of the firms&#x27; optimal profits. The FOC can be calculated by setting the first derivative of the objective function to zero. For example, assume that the firm formula_2&#x27;s demand function is formula_3, where formula_4 is the quantity produced by the other firm , formula_5 is the amount produced by firm formula_2, and formula_7 is the market. Assume that marginal cost is formula_8. By following the profit maximisation rule of equating marginal revenue to marginal costs, firm formula_2 can obtain a total revenue function of formula_10. The marginal revenue function is formula_11.
:formula_12
:formula_13
:formula_14
:formula_15 [1.1]
:formula_16 [1.2]

Equation 1.1 is the reaction function for firm formula_2. Equation 1.2 is the reaction function for firm formula_18. The Nash equilibrium can thus be obtained by solving the equations simultaneously or graphically.

Reaction functions are not necessarily symmetric. Firms may face differing cost functions, in which case the reaction functions and equilibrium quantities would not be identical.

==== &quot;Bertrand model&quot; ====
The Bertrand model is essentially the Cournot–Nash model, except the strategic variable is price rather than quantity.

Bertrand&#x27;s model assumes that firms are selling homogeneous products and therefore have the same marginal production costs, and firms will focus on competing in prices simultaneously. After competing in prices for a while, firms would eventually reach an equilibrium where prices would be the same as marginal costs of production. The mechanism behind this model is that even by undercutting just a small increment of its price, a firm would be able to capture the entire market share. Even though empirical studies suggest that firms can easily make much higher profits by agreeing on charging a price higher than marginal costs, highly rational firms would still not be able to stay at a price higher than marginal cost. Whilst Bertrand price competition is a useful abstraction of markets in many settings, due to its lack of ability to capture human behavioural patterns, the approach has been criticised for being inaccurate in predicting prices.

The model assumptions are:
* There are two firms in the market
* They produce a homogeneous product
* They produce at a constant marginal cost
* Firms choose prices formula_19 and formula_20 simultaneously
* Firms outputs are perfect substitutes
* Sales are split evenly if formula_21

The only Nash equilibrium is formula_22. In this situation, if a firm raises prices, it will lose all its customers. If a firm lowers price, formula_23, then it will lose money on every unit sold.

The Bertrand equilibrium is the same as the competitive result. Each firm produces where formula_24, resulting in zero profits. A generalization of the Bertrand model is the Bertrand–Edgeworth model, which allows for capacity constraints and a more general cost function.

==== &quot;Cournot-Bertrand model&quot; ====
The Cournot model and Bertrand model are the most well-known models in oligopoly theory, and have been studied and reviewed by numerous economists. The Cournot-Bertrand model is a hybrid of these two models and was first developed by Bylka and Komar in 1976. This model allows the market to be split into two groups of firms. The first group&#x27;s aim is to optimally adjust their output to maximise profits, while the second group&#x27;s aim is to optimally adjust their prices. This model is not accepted by some economists who believe that firms in the same industry cannot compete with different strategic variables. Nonetheless, this model has been applied and observed in both real-world examples and theoretical contexts.

In the Cournot model and Bertrand model, it is assumed that all the firms are competing with the same choice variable, either output or price. However, some economists have argued that this does not always apply in real world contexts. Economists Kreps and Scheinkman&#x27;s research demonstrates that varying economic environments are required in order for firms to compete in the same industry while using different strategic variables. An example of the Cournot-Bertrand model in real life can be seen in the market of alcoholic beverages. The production times of alcoholic beverages differ greatly creating different economic environments within the market. The fermentation of distilled spirits takes a significant amount of time; therefore, output is set by producers, leaving the market conditions to determine price. Whereas, the production of brandy requires minimal time to age, thus the price is set by the producers and the supply is determined by the quantity demanded at that price.

=== Kinked demand curve model ===

In an oligopoly, firms operate under imperfect competition. The fierce price competitiveness, created by a sticky-upward demand curve, causes firms to use non-price competition in order to accrue greater revenue and market share.

&quot;Kinked&quot; demand curves appear similar to traditional demand curves but are distinguished by a hypothesised convex bend with a discontinuity at the bend–&quot;kink&quot;. Thus, the first derivative at that point is undefined and leads to a jump discontinuity in the marginal revenue curve. Because of this jump discontinuity in the marginal revenue curve, marginal cost could change without necessarily changing the price or quantity. The motivation behind the kink is that in an oligopolistic or monopolistic competitive market, firms will not raise their prices because even a small price increase will lose many customers. However, even a large price decrease will gain only a few customers because such an action will begin a price war with other firms. The curve is, therefore, more price-elastic for price increases and less so for price decreases. This model predicts that more firms will enter the industry in the long run, since market price for oligopolists is more stable.

The kinked demand curve for a joint profit-maximizing oligopoly industry can model the behaviors of oligopolists&#x27; pricing decisions other than that of the price leader.

==== &quot;Assumptions&quot; ====
According to the kinked-demand model, each firm faces a demand curve kinked at the existing price. The assumptions of the model are:
* If a firm raises its price above the current existing price, competitors will not follow and the acting firm will lose market share.
* If a firm lowers prices below the existing price, their competitors will follow to retain their market share and the firm&#x27;s output will increase only marginally.

If the assumptions hold, then:
* The firm&#x27;s marginal revenue curve is discontinuous and not differentiable, having a gap at the kink.
* For prices above the prevailing price, the curve is relatively elastic.
* For prices below the point, the curve is relatively inelastic.

The gap in the marginal revenue curve means that marginal costs can fluctuate without changing equilibrium price and quantity Thus, prices tend to be rigid.

=== Other descriptions ===
Market power and market concentration can be estimated or quantified using several different tools and measurements, including the Lerner index, stochastic frontier analysis, New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) modeling, as well as the Herfindahl-Hirschman index. As a quantitative description of oligopoly, the four-firm concentration ratio is often utilised and is the most preferable ratio for analyzing market concentration. This measure expresses, as a percentage, the market share of the four largest firms in any particular industry. For example, as of fourth quarter 2008, the combined total market share of Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and T-Mobile comprises 97% of the U.S. cellular telephone market.

== Oligopolies and competition laws ==
Oligopolies are assumed to be aware of competition laws as well as the repercussions that they could face if caught engaging in anti-competition behaviour. In lieu of explicit communication, firms may be observed as engaging in tacit collusion, which occurs through competitors collectively and implicitly understanding that by jointly raising prices, each competitor can achieve economic profits comparable to those achieved by a monopolist while avoiding breaches of market regulations.

=== Policing of anticompetitive behaviour ===
Competition authorities have taken various measures to effectively discover and prosecute oligopolistic and anticompetitive behaviour. The leniency program and screening are currently two popular mechanisms.

==== Leniency programs ====
Leniency programs encourage antitrust firms to be more proactive participants in confessing collusive behaviours by granting them immunity from fines, among other penal reductions. Leniency programs have been implemented by countries including the US, Japan and Canada. Nonetheless, leniency programs may be abused, their efficacy has been questioned, and they ultimately allow some colluding firms to experience less harsh penalties. It is currently unknown what the overall effect of leniency programs is.

Screening

There are two screening methods that are currently available for competition authorities: structural screening and behavioural screening. Structural screening refers to the identification of industry traits or characteristics, such as homogeneous goods, stable demand, less existing participants, which are prone to cartel formation. Behavioural screening is typically implemented when a cartel formation or agreement has already been reached, with authorities subsequently looking into firms&#x27; data to determine if price variance is low or experiences significant price changes.

== Possible outcomes of oligopolies ==

=== Formation of cartels ===
Particular companies may employ restrictive trade practices in order to inflate prices and restrict production in much the same way that a monopoly does. Whenever there is a formal agreement for such collusion between companies that usually compete with one another, the practice is known as a cartel. An example of an economic cartel is OPEC, where oligopolistic countries control the worldwide oil supply, leaving a profound influence on the international price of oil.

There are legal restrictions on cartels in most countries, with regulations and enforcement against cartels having been enacted since the late 1990s. For example, EU competition law has prohibited some unreasonable anti-competitive practices, such as directly or indirectly fixing selling prices, manipulating market supplies and controlling trade among competitors. In the US, the &quot;Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission&quot; was created to fight collusion among cartels&quot;.&quot; Tacit collusion is becoming a more popular topic in the development of anti-trust law in most countries.

=== Possibility of efficient outcomes ===
Competition between sellers in an oligopoly can be fierce, with relatively low prices and high production. Hypothetically, this could lead to an efficient outcome approaching perfect competition.

As competition in an oligopoly can be greater when there are more competitors in an industry, it is theoretically harder to sustain cartels in an industry with a larger number of firms, as there will be less collusive profit for each firm. Consequently, existing firms may have more incentive to deviate. However, empirical evidence has shown this conclusion to be ambiguous. Thus, the welfare analysis of oligopolies is sensitive to the parameter values used to define the market&#x27;s structure. In particular, the level of dead weight loss is hard to measure. The study of product differentiation indicates that oligopolies might also create excessive levels of differentiation in order to stifle competition, as they could gain certain marker power by offering somewhat differentiated products.

=== Price wars ===
One possible outcome of oligopoly is the price war. A common aspect of oligopolies is the ability to engage in price competition selectively. Schendel and Balestra contend that at least some players in a price war can profit from participation.

== Examples ==
Many industries have been cited as oligopolistic, including civil aviation, agricultural pesticides, electricity, and platinum group metal mining. In most countries, the telecommunications sector is characterized by an oligopolistic market structure.

=== Europe ===

In the European Union, rail freight markets have an oligopolistic structure.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; supermarket chains - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury&#x27;s and Morrisons - is an oligopoly. The development of this oligopoly is believed to have resulted in a reduction of competition in the retail sector, coincides with the decline of independent high street retailers, and may also be affecting suppliers and farmers through monopsony.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====

In Canada, supermarkets have been identified as oligopolistic, largely falling under only three chains. Other industries identified as oligopolistic include banks, telecommunications, and airlines.

==== United States ====
In the United States, industries that have identified as oligopolistic include food processing, funeral services, sugar refining, beer making, pulp and paper making, the (duopolistic) two-party political system, mobile network carriers and the &quot;big three&quot; of automobile manufacturing.

<text>In ecology, an oasis (; : oases ) is a fertile area of a desert or semi-desert environment that sustains plant life and provides habitat for animals. Surface water may be present, or water may only be accessible from wells or underground channels created by humans. In geography, an oasis may be a current or past rest stop on a transportation route, or less-than-verdant location that nonetheless provides access to underground water through deep wells created and maintained by humans. Although they depend on a natural condition, such as the presence of water that may be stored in reservoirs and used for irrigation, most oases, as we know them, are artificial.

The word &quot;oasis&quot; came into English from , from , , which in turn is a direct borrowing from Demotic Egyptian. The word for &quot;oasis&quot; in the latter-attested Coptic language (the descendant of Demotic Egyptian) is &quot;wahe&quot; or &quot;ouahe&quot; which means a &quot;dwelling place&quot;. Oasis in Arabic is &quot;wāḥa&quot; ().

== Description ==
Oases develop in &quot;hydrologically favored&quot; locations that have attributes such as a high water table, seasonal lakes, or blockaded wadis. Oases are made when sources of freshwater, such as underground rivers or aquifers, irrigate the surface naturally or via man-made wells. The presence of water on the surface or underground is necessary and the local or regional management of this essential resource is strategic, but not sufficient to create such areas: continuous human work and know-how (a technical and social culture) are essential to maintain such ecosystems. Some of the possible human contributions to maintaining an oasis include digging and maintaining wells, digging and maintaining canals, and continuously removing opportunistic plants that threaten to gorge themselves on water and fertility needed to maintain human and animal food supplies. Stereotypically, an oasis has a &quot;central pool of open water surrounded by a ring of water-dependent shrubs and trees…which are in turn encircled by an outlying transition zone to desert plants.&quot;

Rain showers provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases, such as the Tuat. Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets, or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface. Any incidence of water is then used by migrating birds, which also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water&#x27;s edge forming an oasis. It can also be used to plant crops.

===Geography===
Oases in the Middle East and North Africa cover about , however, they support the livelihood of about 10 million inhabitants. The stark ratio of oasis to desert land in the world means that the oasis ecosystem is &quot;relatively minute, rare and precious.&quot;

There are 90 “major oases” within the Sahara Desert. Some of their fertility may derive from irrigation systems called &quot;foggaras&quot;, &quot;khettaras&quot;, &quot;lkhttarts&quot;, or a variety of other regional names&quot;.&quot;

In some oases systems, there is &quot;a geometrical system of raised channels that release controlled amounts of the water into individual plots, soaking the soil.&quot;

===History===
Oases often have human histories that are measured in millennia. Archeological digs at Ein Gedi in the Dead Sea Valley have found evidence of settlement dating to 6,000 BC. Al-Ahsa on the Arabian Peninsula shows evidence of human residence dating to the Neolithic.

Anthropologically, the oasis is &quot;an area of sedentary life, which associates the city [&quot;medina&quot;] or village [&quot;ksar&quot;] with its surrounding feeding source, the palm grove, within a relational and circulatory nomadic system.&quot;

The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas; caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both north–south and east–west trade in the Sahara Desert. The location of oases also informed the Darb El Arba&#x27;īn trade route from Sudan to Egypt, as well as the caravan route from the Niger River to Tangier, Morocco. The Silk Road &quot;traced its course from water hole to water hole, relying on oasis communities such as Turpan in China and Samarkand in Uzbekistan.&quot;

According to the United Nations, &quot;Oases are at the very heart of the overall development of peri-Saharan countries due to their geographical location and the fact they are preferred migration routes in times of famine or insecurity in the region.&quot;

Oases in Oman, on the Arabian Peninsula near the Persian Gulf, vary somewhat from the Saharan form. While still located in an arid or semi-arid zone with a date palm overstory, these oases are usually located &quot;below plateaus&quot; and &quot;watered either by springs or by &quot;aflaj&quot;, tunnel systems dug into the ground or carved into the rock to tap underground aquifers.&quot; This rainwater harvesting system &quot;never developed a serious salinity problem.&quot;


===Palm Oasis===
In the drylands of southwestern North America, there is a habitat form called Palm Oasis (alternately Palm Series or Oasis Scrub Woodland) that has the native California fan palm as the overstory species. These Palm Oases can be found in California, Arizona, Baja California, and Sonora.

== Agroforestry ==
People who live in an oasis must manage land and water use carefully. The most important plant in an oasis is the date palm (&quot;Phoenix dactylifera&quot; L.), which forms the upper layer. These palm trees provide shade for smaller understory trees like apricots, dates, figs, olives, and peach trees, which form the middle layer. Market-garden vegetables, some cereals (such as sorghum, barley, millet, and wheat), and/or mixed animal fodder, are grown in the bottom layer where there is more moisture. The oasis is integrated into its desert environment through an often close association with nomadic transhumant livestock farming (very often pastoral and sedentary populations are clearly distinguished). The fertility of the oasis soil is restored by &quot;cyclic organic inputs of animal origin.&quot; In summary, an oasis palm grove is a highly anthropized and irrigated area that supports a traditionally intensive and polyculture-based agriculture.

Responding to environmental constraints, the three strata create what is called the &quot;oasis effect&quot;. The three layers and all their interaction points create a variety of combinations of &quot;horizontal wind speed, relative air temperature and relative air humidity.&quot; The plantings—through a virtuous cycle of wind reduction, increased shade and evapotranspiration—create a microclimate favorable to crops; &quot;measurements taken in different oases have showed that the potential evapotranspiration of the areas was reduced by 30 to 50 percent within the oasis.&quot;

The keystone date palm trees are &quot;a main income source and staple food for local populations in many countries in which they are cultivated, and have played significant roles in the economy, society, and environment of those countries.&quot; Challenges for date palm oasis polycultures include &quot;low rainfall, high temperatures, water resources often high in salt content, and high incidence of pests.&quot;

==Distressed systems==
Many historic oases have struggled with drought and inadequate maintenance.

According to a United Nations report on the future of oases in the Sahara and Sahel, &quot;Increasingly... oases are subject to various pressures, heavily influenced by the effects of climate change, decreasing groundwater levels and a gradual loss of cultural heritage due to a fading historical memory concerning traditional water management techniques. These natural pressures are compounded by demographic pressures and the introduction of modern water pumping techniques that can disrupt traditional resource management schemes, particularly in the North Saharan oases.&quot;

For example, five historic oases in the Western Desert of Egypt (Kharga, Dakhla, Farafra, Baharyia, and Siwa) once had &quot;flowing spring and wells&quot; but due to the decline of groundwater heads because of overuse for land reclamation projects those water sources are no more and the oases suffer as a result.

Morocco has lost two-thirds of its oasis habitat over the last 100 years due to heat, drought, and water scarcity. The Ferkla Oases in Morocco once drew on water from the Ferkla, Sat and Tangarfa Rivers but they are now dry but for a few days a year.

<doc id="22206" wikidata="Q8377" url="?curid=22206" title="Oboe">
<text>The oboe ( ) is a type of double-reed woodwind instrument. Oboes are usually made of wood, but may also be made of synthetic materials, such as plastic, resin, or hybrid composites.

The most common type of oboe, the soprano oboe pitched in C, measures roughly long and has metal keys, a conical bore and a flared bell. Sound is produced by blowing into the reed at a sufficient air pressure, causing it to vibrate with the air column. The distinctive tone is versatile and has been described as &quot;bright&quot;. When the word &quot;oboe&quot; is used alone, it is generally taken to mean the soprano member rather than other instruments of the family, such as the bass oboe, the cor anglais (English horn), or oboe d&#x27;amore.

Today, the oboe is commonly used as orchestral or solo instrument in symphony orchestras, concert bands and chamber ensembles. The oboe is especially used in classical music, film music, some genres of folk music, and is occasionally heard in jazz, rock, pop, and popular music. The oboe is widely recognized as the instrument that tunes the orchestra with its distinctive &#x27;A&#x27;.

A musician who plays the oboe is called an oboist.

==Sound==

In comparison to other modern woodwind instruments, the soprano oboe is sometimes referred to as having a &quot;bright and penetrating&quot; voice. &quot;The Sprightly Companion&quot;, an instruction book published by Henry Playford in 1695, describes the oboe as &quot;Majestical and Stately, and not much Inferior to the Trumpet&quot;. In the play &quot;Angels in America&quot; the sound is described as like &quot;that of a duck if the duck were a songbird&quot;. The rich timbre is derived from its conical bore (as opposed to the generally cylindrical bore of flutes and clarinets). As a result, oboes are easier to hear over other instruments in large ensembles due to its penetrating sound. The highest note is a semitone lower than the nominally highest note of the B clarinet. Since the clarinet has a wider range, the lowest note of the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.

Music for the standard oboe is written in concert pitch (i.e., it is not a transposing instrument), and the instrument has a soprano range, usually from B3 to G6. Orchestras tune to a concert A played by the first oboe. According to the League of American Orchestras, this is done because the pitch is secure and its penetrating sound makes it ideal for tuning. The pitch of the oboe is affected by the way in which the reed is made. The reed has a significant effect on the sound. Variations in cane and other construction materials, the age of the reed, and differences in scrape and length all affect the pitch. German and French reeds, for instance, differ in many ways, causing the sound to vary accordingly. Weather conditions such as temperature and humidity also affect the pitch. Skilled oboists adjust their embouchure to compensate for these factors. Subtle manipulation of embouchure and air pressure allows the oboist to express timbre and dynamics.

=== Reeds ===

The oboe uses a double reed, similar to that used for the bassoon. Most professional oboists make their reeds to suit their individual needs. By making their reeds, oboists can precisely control factors such as tone color, intonation, and responsiveness. They can also account for individual embouchure, oral cavity, oboe angle, and air support.

Novice oboists rarely make their own reeds, as the process is difficult and time-consuming, and frequently purchase reeds from a music store instead. Commercially available cane reeds are available in several degrees of hardness; a medium reed is very popular, and most beginners use medium-soft reeds. These reeds, like clarinet, saxophone, and bassoon reeds, are made from &quot;Arundo donax&quot;. As oboists gain more experience, they may start making their own reeds after the model of their teacher or buying handmade reeds (usually from a professional oboist) and using special tools including gougers, pre-gougers, guillotines, shaper tips, knives, and other tools to make and adjust reeds to their liking. The reed is considered the part of oboe that makes the instrument so difficult because the individual nature of each reed means that it is hard to achieve a consistent sound. Slight variations in temperature, humidity, altitude, weather, and climate can also have an effect on the sound of the reed, as well as minute changes in the physique of the reed.

Oboists often prepare several reeds to achieve a consistent sound, as well as to prepare for environmental factors such as chipping of a reed or other hazards. Oboists may have different preferred methods for soaking their reeds to produce optimal sounds; the most preferred method tends to be to soak the oboe reed in water before playing.

Plastic oboe reeds are rarely used, and are less readily available than plastic reeds for other instruments, such as the clarinet. However, they do exist, and are produced by brands such as Legere.

== History ==
Centuries before the Spanish and Portuguese conquests in the New World, the early version of the &quot;chirimía&quot; arrived in Europe from the Middle East due to cultural exchanges. The Crusades brought Europeans into contact with the Turko-Arabic &quot;zurna&quot;. However, the oboe’s roots go back even further, linked to ancient reed instruments like those of Egypt and Mesopotamia, as well as the Greek &quot;aulos&quot; and Roman &quot;tibia&quot;. Nearly lost in the West during the Dark Ages, the oboe reappeared with the Arabic &quot;zurna&quot; in the 13th century, evolving through European bagpipes and finally becoming the French hautbois in the 17th century, which is when modern oboe history truly began. In English, prior to 1770, the standard instrument was called a &quot;hautbois&quot;, &quot;hoboy&quot;, or &quot;French hoboy&quot; ( ). This was borrowed from the French name, , which is a compound word made up of &quot;haut&quot; (&quot;high&quot;, &quot;loud&quot;) and &quot;bois&quot; (&quot;wood&quot;, &quot;woodwind&quot;). The French word means &#x27;high-pitched woodwind&#x27; in English. The spelling of &quot;oboe&quot; was adopted into English from the Italian &quot;oboè&quot;, a transliteration of the 17th-century pronunciation of the French name.

The regular oboe first appeared in the mid-17th century, when it was called a &quot;hautbois&quot;. This name was also used for its predecessor, the shawm, from which the basic form of the &quot;hautbois&quot; was derived. Major differences between the two instruments include the division of the &quot;hautbois&quot; into three sections, or joints (which allowed for more precise manufacture), and the elimination of the &quot;pirouette&quot;, the wooden ledge below the reed which allowed players to rest their lips.

The exact date and location of origin of the &quot;hautbois&quot; are obscure, as are the inventors. Circumstantial evidence, such as the statement by the flautist composer Michel de la Barre in his &quot;Memoire&quot;, points to members of the Philidor (Filidor) and Hotteterre families. The instrument may in fact have had multiple inventors. The &quot;hautbois&quot; quickly spread throughout Europe, including Great Britain, where it was called &quot;hautboy&quot;, &quot;hoboy&quot;, &quot;hautboit&quot;, &quot;howboye&quot;, and similar variants of the French name. It was the main melody instrument in early military bands, until it was succeeded by the clarinet.

The standard Baroque oboe is generally made of boxwood and has three keys: a &quot;great&quot; key and two side keys (the side key is often doubled to facilitate use of either the right or left hand on the bottom holes). In order to produce higher pitches, the player has to &quot;overblow&quot;, or increase the air stream to reach the next harmonic. Notable oboe-makers of the period are the Germans Jacob Denner and J.H. Eichentopf, and the English Thomas Stanesby (died 1734) and his son Thomas Jr (died 1754). The range for the Baroque oboe comfortably extends from C4 to D6. In the mid-20th century, with the resurgence of interest in early music, a few makers began producing copies to specifications taken from surviving historical instruments.

=== Classical ===
The Classical period brought a regular oboe whose bore was gradually narrowed, and the instrument became outfitted with several keys, among them those for the notes D, F, and G. A key similar to the modern octave key was also added called the &quot;slur key&quot;, though it was at first used more like the &quot;flick&quot; keys on the modern German bassoon. Only later did French instrument makers redesign the octave key to be used in the manner of the modern key (i.e. held open for the upper register, closed for the lower). The narrower bore allows the higher notes to be more easily played, and composers began to use the oboe&#x27;s upper register more often in their works. Because of this, the oboe&#x27;s tessitura in the Classical era was somewhat broader than that found in Baroque works. The range for the Classical oboe extends from C4 to F6 (using the scientific pitch notation system), though some German and Austrian oboes are capable of playing one half-step lower.

Several Classical-era composers wrote concertos for oboe. Mozart composed both the solo concerto in C major K. 314/285d and the lost original of Sinfonia Concertante in E major K. 297b, as well as a fragment of F major concerto K. 417f. Haydn wrote both the Sinfonia Concertante in B Hob. I:105 and the spurious concerto in C major Hob. VIIg:C1. Beethoven wrote the F major concerto, Hess 12, of which only sketches survive, though the second movement was reconstructed in the late 20th century). Numerous other composers including Johann Christian Bach, Johann Christian Fischer, Jan Antonín Koželuh, and Ludwig August Lebrun also composed pieces for the oboe. Many solos exist for the regular oboe in chamber, symphonic, and operatic compositions from the Classical era.

=== Wiener oboe ===

The Wiener oboe (Viennese oboe) is a type of modern oboe that retains the essential bore and tonal characteristics of the historical oboe. The Akademiemodel Wiener Oboe, first developed in the late 19th century by Josef Hajek from earlier instruments by C. T. Golde of Dresden (1803–73), is now made by several makers such as André Constantinides, Karl Rado, Guntram Wolf, Christian Rauch and Yamaha. It has a wider internal bore, a shorter and broader reed and the fingering-system is very different from the conservatoire oboe. In &quot;The Oboe&quot;, Geoffrey Burgess and Bruce Haynes write &quot;The differences are most clearly marked in the middle register, which is reedier and more pungent, and the upper register, which is richer in harmonics on the Viennese oboe&quot;. Guntram Wolf describes them: &quot;From the concept of the bore, the Viennese oboe is the last representative of the historical oboes, adapted for the louder, larger orchestra, and fitted with an extensive mechanism. Its great advantage is the ease of speaking, even in the lowest register. It can be played very expressively and blends well with other instruments.&quot; The Viennese oboe is, along with the Vienna horn, perhaps the most distinctive member of the Wiener Philharmoniker instrumentarium.

=== Conservatoire oboe === 
This oboe was developed further in the 19th century by the Triébert family of Paris. Using the Boehm flute as a source of ideas for key work, Guillaume Triébert and his sons, Charles and Frederic, devised a series of increasingly complex yet functional key systems. A variant form using large tone holes, the Boehm system oboe, was never in common use, though it was used in some military bands in Europe into the 20th century. F. Lorée of Paris made further developments to the modern instrument. Minor improvements to the bore and key work have continued through the 20th century, but there has been no fundamental change to the general characteristics of the instrument for several decades.

=== Modern oboe ===
The modern standard oboe is most commonly made from grenadilla, also known as African blackwood, although some manufacturers also make oboes out of other species of the genus &quot;Dalbergia&quot;, which includes cocobolo, rosewood, and violetwood (also known as kingwood). Ebony (genus Diospyros) has also been used. Student model oboes are often made from plastic resin to make the instrument cheaper and more durable.

The oboe has an extremely narrow conical bore. It is played with a double reed consisting of two thin blades of cane tied together on a small-diameter metal tube (staple) which is inserted into the reed socket at the top of the instrument. The commonly accepted range for the oboe extends from B3 to about G6, over two and a half octaves, though its common tessitura lies from C4 to E6. Some student oboes do not have a B key and only extend down to B3.

A modern oboe with the &quot;full conservatoire&quot; (&quot;conservatory&quot; in the US) or Gillet key system has 45 pieces of keywork, with the possible additions of a third-octave key and alternate (left little finger) F- or C-key. The keys are usually made of nickel silver, and are silver- or occasionally gold-plated. Besides the full conservatoire system, oboes are also made using the British thumbplate system. Most have &quot;semi-automatic&quot; octave keys, in which the second-octave action closes the first, and some have a fully automatic octave key system, as used on saxophones. Some full-conservatory oboes have finger holes covered with rings rather than plates (&quot;open-holed&quot;), and most of the professional models have at least the right-hand third key open-holed. Professional oboes used in the UK and Iceland frequently feature conservatoire system combined with a thumb plate. Releasing the thumb plate has the same effect as pressing down the right-hand index-finger key. This produces alternate options which eliminate the necessity for most of the common cross-intervals (intervals where two or more keys need to be released and pressed down simultaneously), as cross-intervals are much more difficult to execute in such a way that the sound remains clear and continuous throughout the frequency change (a quality also called legato and often called for in the oboe repertoire).

== Other members of the oboe family ==

The standard oboe has several siblings of various sizes and playing ranges. The most widely known and used today is the cor anglais (English horn) the tenor (or alto) member of the family. A transposing instrument; it is pitched in F, a perfect fifth lower than the oboe. The oboe d&#x27;amore, the alto (or mezzo-soprano) member of the family, is pitched in A, a minor third lower than the oboe. J.S. Bach made extensive use of both the oboe d&#x27;amore as well as the &quot;taille&quot; and oboe da caccia, Baroque antecedents of the cor anglais.

Less common is the bass oboe (also called baritone oboe), which sounds one octave lower than the oboe. Delius, Strauss and Holst scored for the instrument.

Similar to the bass oboe is the more powerful heckelphone, which has a wider bore and larger tone than the baritone oboe. Only 165 heckelphones have ever been made. Competent heckelphone players are difficult to find due to the extreme rarity of this particular instrument.

The least common of all are the musette (also called oboe musette or piccolo oboe), the sopranino member of the family (it is usually pitched in E or F above the oboe), and the contrabass oboe (typically pitched in C, two octaves deeper than the standard oboe).

Folk versions of the oboe, sometimes equipped with extensive keywork, are found throughout Europe. These include the musette (France) and the piston oboe and bombarde (Brittany), the piffero and ciaramella (Italy), and the xirimia (also spelled chirimia) (Spain). Many of these are played in tandem with local forms of bagpipe, particularly with the Italian müsa and zampogna or Breton biniou.

David Stock&#x27;s concerto &quot;Oborama&quot; features the Oboe and its other members as a soloist, the instrument changing in each movement. (ex. Oboe D&#x27;amore in movement 3 and Bass Oboe in movement 4)

== Use in non-classical music ==

=== Jazz ===
The oboe remains uncommon in jazz music, but there have been notable uses of the instrument. Some early bands in the 1920s and 1930s, most notably that of Paul Whiteman, included it for coloristic purposes. Most often in this era it was used for dance band music, but occasionally oboists may be heard used in a similar manner to a saxophone for solos. Most of the time these oboists were already playing with the band or orchestra on a different woodwind instrument. The multi-instrumentalist Garvin Bushell (1902–1991) played the oboe in jazz bands as early as 1924 and used the instrument throughout his career, eventually recording with John Coltrane in 1961. Gil Evans featured oboe in sections of his famous &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; collaboration with trumpeter Miles Davis. Though primarily a tenor saxophone and flute player, Yusef Lateef was among the first (in 1961) to use the oboe as a solo instrument in modern jazz performances and recordings. Composer and double bassist Charles Mingus gave the oboe a brief but prominent role (played by Dick Hafer) in his composition &quot;I.X. Love&quot; on the 1963 album &quot;Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus&quot;.

With the birth of jazz fusion in the late 1960s, and its continuous development through the following decade, the oboe became somewhat more prominent, replacing on some occasions the saxophone as the focal point. The oboe was used with great success by the Welsh multi-instrumentalist Karl Jenkins in his work with the groups Nucleus and Soft Machine, and by the American woodwind player Paul McCandless, co-founder of the Paul Winter Consort and later Oregon.

The 1980s saw an increasing number of oboists try their hand at non-classical work, and many players of note have recorded and performed alternative music on oboe. Some present-day jazz groups influenced by classical music, such as the Maria Schneider Orchestra, feature the oboe.

===Rock and pop===
Indie singer-songwriter and composer Sufjan Stevens, having studied the instrument in school, often includes the instrument in his arrangements and compositions, most frequently in his geographic tone-poems &quot;Illinois&quot;, &quot;Michigan&quot;. Peter Gabriel played the oboe while he was a member of Genesis, most prominently on &quot;The Musical Box&quot;. Andy Mackay of Roxy Music plays oboe, sometimes with a Wah-Wah pedal.

=== Film music ===
The oboe is frequently featured in film music, often to underscore a particularly poignant or emotional scene. An example is the 1989 film &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;. One of the most prominent uses of the oboe in a film score is Ennio Morricone&#x27;s &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Oboe&quot; theme from the 1986 film &quot;The Mission&quot;.

It is featured as a solo instrument in the theme &quot;Across the Stars&quot; from the John Williams score to the 2002 film &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;.

The oboe is also featured as a solo instrument in the &quot;Love Theme&quot; in Nino Rota&#x27;s score to &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972).

<text>Organic chemistry is a subdiscipline within chemistry involving the scientific study of the structure, properties, and reactions of organic compounds and organic materials, i.e., matter in its various forms that contain carbon atoms. Study of structure determines their structural formula. Study of properties includes physical and chemical properties, and evaluation of chemical reactivity to understand their behavior. The study of organic reactions includes the chemical synthesis of natural products, drugs, and polymers, and study of individual organic molecules in the laboratory and via theoretical (in silico) study.

The range of chemicals studied in organic chemistry includes hydrocarbons (compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen) as well as compounds based on carbon, but also containing other elements, especially oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus (included in many biochemicals) and the halogens. Organometallic chemistry is the study of compounds containing carbon–metal bonds.

Organic compounds form the basis of all earthly life and constitute the majority of known chemicals. The bonding patterns of carbon, with its valence of four—formal single, double, and triple bonds, plus structures with delocalized electrons—make the array of organic compounds structurally diverse, and their range of applications enormous. They form the basis of, or are constituents of, many commercial products including pharmaceuticals; petrochemicals and agrichemicals, and products made from them including lubricants, solvents; plastics; fuels and explosives. The study of organic chemistry overlaps organometallic chemistry and biochemistry, but also with medicinal chemistry, polymer chemistry, and materials science.

==Educational aspects==
Organic chemistry is typically taught at the college or university level. It is considered a very challenging course but has also been made accessible to students.

==History==

Before the 18th century, chemists generally believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were endowed with a vital force that distinguished them from inorganic compounds. According to the concept of vitalism (vital force theory), organic matter was endowed with a &quot;vital force&quot;. During the first half of the nineteenth century, some of the first systematic studies of organic compounds were reported. Around 1816 Michel Chevreul started a study of soaps made from various fats and alkalis. He separated the acids that, in combination with the alkali, produced the soap. Since these were all individual compounds, he demonstrated that it was possible to make a chemical change in various fats (which traditionally come from organic sources), producing new compounds, without &quot;vital force&quot;. In 1828 Friedrich Wöhler produced the &quot;organic&quot; chemical urea (carbamide), a constituent of urine, from &quot;inorganic&quot; starting materials (the salts potassium cyanate and ammonium sulfate), in what is now called the Wöhler synthesis. Although Wöhler himself was cautious about claiming he had disproved vitalism, this was the first time a substance thought to be organic was synthesized in the laboratory without biological (organic) starting materials. The event is now generally accepted as indeed disproving the doctrine of vitalism.

After Wöhler, Justus von Liebig worked on the organization of organic chemistry, being considered one of its principal founders.

In 1856, William Henry Perkin, while trying to manufacture quinine, accidentally produced the organic dye now known as Perkin&#x27;s mauve. His discovery, made widely known through its financial success, greatly increased interest in organic chemistry.

A crucial breakthrough for organic chemistry was the concept of chemical structure, developed independently in 1858 by both Friedrich August Kekulé and Archibald Scott Couper. Both researchers suggested that tetravalent carbon atoms could link to each other to form a carbon lattice, and that the detailed patterns of atomic bonding could be discerned by skillful interpretations of appropriate chemical reactions.

The era of the pharmaceutical industry began in the last decade of the 19th century when the German company, Bayer, first manufactured acetylsalicylic acid—more commonly known as aspirin. By 1910 Paul Ehrlich and his laboratory group began developing arsenic-based arsphenamine, (Salvarsan), as the first effective medicinal treatment of syphilis, and thereby initiated the medical practice of chemotherapy. Ehrlich popularized the concepts of &quot;magic bullet&quot; drugs and of systematically improving drug therapies. His laboratory made decisive contributions to developing antiserum for diphtheria and standardizing therapeutic serums.

Early examples of organic reactions and applications were often found because of a combination of luck and preparation for unexpected observations. The latter half of the 19th century however witnessed systematic studies of organic compounds. The development of synthetic indigo is illustrative. The production of indigo from plant sources dropped from 19,000 tons in 1897 to 1,000 tons by 1914 thanks to the synthetic methods developed by Adolf von Baeyer. In 2002, 17,000 tons of synthetic indigo were produced from petrochemicals.

In the early part of the 20th century, polymers and enzymes were shown to be large organic molecules, and petroleum was shown to be of biological origin.

The multiple-step synthesis of complex organic compounds is called total synthesis. Total synthesis of complex natural compounds increased in complexity to glucose and terpineol. For example, cholesterol-related compounds have opened ways to synthesize complex human hormones and their modified derivatives. Since the start of the 20th century, complexity of total syntheses has been increased to include molecules of high complexity such as lysergic acid and vitamin B12.
The discovery of petroleum and the development of the petrochemical industry spurred the development of organic chemistry. Converting individual petroleum compounds into &quot;types&quot; of compounds by various chemical processes led to organic reactions enabling a broad range of industrial and commercial products including, among (many) others: plastics, synthetic rubber, organic adhesives, and various property-modifying petroleum additives and catalysts.

The majority of chemical compounds occurring in biological organisms are carbon compounds, so the association between organic chemistry and biochemistry is so close that biochemistry might be regarded as in essence a branch of organic chemistry. Although the history of biochemistry might be taken to span some four centuries, fundamental understanding of the field only began to develop in the late 19th century and the actual term &quot;biochemistry&quot; was coined around the start of 20th century. Research in the field increased throughout the twentieth century, without any indication of slackening in the rate of increase, as may be verified by inspection of abstraction and indexing services such as BIOSIS Previews and Biological Abstracts, which began in the 1920s as a single annual volume, but has grown so drastically that by the end of the 20th century it was only available to the everyday user as an online electronic database.

== Characterization ==
Since organic compounds often exist as mixtures, a variety of techniques have also been developed to assess purity; chromatography techniques are especially important for this application, and include HPLC and gas chromatography. Traditional methods of separation include distillation, crystallization, evaporation, magnetic separation and solvent extraction.

Organic compounds were traditionally characterized by a variety of chemical tests, called &quot;wet methods&quot;, but such tests have been largely displaced by spectroscopic or other computer-intensive methods of analysis. Listed in approximate order of utility, the chief analytical methods are:
* Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most commonly used technique, often permitting the complete assignment of atom connectivity and even stereochemistry using correlation spectroscopy. The principal constituent atoms of organic chemistry – hydrogen and carbon – exist naturally with NMR-responsive isotopes, respectively 1H and 13C.
* Elemental analysis: A destructive method used to determine the elemental composition of a molecule. See also mass spectrometry, below.
* Mass spectrometry indicates the molecular weight of a compound and, from the fragmentation patterns, its structure. High-resolution mass spectrometry can usually identify the exact formula of a compound and is used in place of elemental analysis. In former times, mass spectrometry was restricted to neutral molecules exhibiting some volatility, but advanced ionization techniques allow one to obtain the &quot;mass spec&quot; of virtually any organic compound.
* Crystallography can be useful for determining molecular geometry when a single crystal of the material is available. Highly efficient hardware and software allows a structure to be determined within hours of obtaining a suitable crystal.

Traditional spectroscopic methods such as infrared spectroscopy, optical rotation, and UV/VIS spectroscopy provide relatively nonspecific structural information but remain in use for specific applications. Refractive index and density can also be important for substance identification.

== Properties ==
The physical properties of organic compounds typically of interest include both quantitative and qualitative features. Quantitative information includes a melting point, boiling point, solubility, and index of refraction. Qualitative properties include odor, consistency, and color.

==Melting and boiling properties==

Organic compounds typically melt and many boil. In contrast, while inorganic materials generally can be melted, many do not boil, and instead tend to degrade. In earlier times, the melting point (m.p.) and boiling point (b.p.) provided crucial information on the purity and identity of organic compounds. The melting and boiling points correlate with the polarity of the molecules and their molecular weight. Some organic compounds, especially symmetrical ones, sublime. A well-known example of a sublimable organic compound is para-dichlorobenzene, the odiferous constituent of modern mothballs. Organic compounds are usually not very stable at temperatures above 300 °C, although some exceptions exist.

===Solubility===
Neutral organic compounds tend to be hydrophobic; that is, they are less soluble in water than inorganic solvents. Exceptions include organic compounds that contain ionizable groups as well as low molecular weight alcohols, amines, and carboxylic acids where hydrogen bonding occurs. Otherwise, organic compounds tend to dissolve in organic solvents. Solubility varies widely with the organic solute and with the organic solvent.

===Solid state properties===

Various specialized properties of molecular crystals and organic polymers with conjugated systems are of interest depending on applications, e.g. thermo-mechanical and electro-mechanical such as piezoelectricity, electrical conductivity (see conductive polymers and organic semiconductors), and electro-optical (e.g. non-linear optics) properties. For historical reasons, such properties are mainly the subjects of the areas of polymer science and materials science.

== Nomenclature ==

The names of organic compounds are either systematic, following logically from a set of rules, or nonsystematic, following various traditions. Systematic nomenclature is stipulated by specifications from IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry). Systematic nomenclature starts with the name for a parent structure within the molecule of interest. This parent name is then modified by prefixes, suffixes, and numbers to unambiguously convey the structure. Given that millions of organic compounds are known, rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome. Thus, IUPAC recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds, but not complex molecules. To use the systematic naming, one must know the structures and names of the parent structures. Parent structures include unsubstituted hydrocarbons, heterocycles, and mono functionalized derivatives thereof.

Nonsystematic nomenclature is simpler and unambiguous, at least to organic chemists. Nonsystematic names do not indicate the structure of the compound. They are common for complex molecules, which include most natural products. Thus, the informally named lysergic acid diethylamide is systematically named
(6a&quot;R&quot;,9&quot;R&quot;)-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-diethyl-7-methyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo-[4,3-&quot;fg&quot;] quinoline-9-carboxamide.

With the increased use of computing, other naming methods have evolved that are intended to be interpreted by machines. Two popular formats are SMILES and InChI.

===Structural drawings===
Organic molecules are described more commonly by drawings or structural formulas, combinations of drawings and chemical symbols. The line-angle formula is simple and unambiguous. In this system, the endpoints and intersections of each line represent one carbon, and hydrogen atoms can either be notated explicitly or assumed to be present as implied by tetravalent carbon.
===History===
By 1880 an explosion in the number of chemical compounds being discovered occurred assisted by new synthetic and analytical techniques. Grignard described the situation as &quot;chaos le plus complet&quot; (complete chaos) due to the lack of convention it was possible to have multiple names for the same compound. This led to the creation of the Geneva rules in 1892.

==Classification of organic compounds==

===Functional groups===

The concept of functional groups is central in organic chemistry, both as a means to classify structures and for predicting properties. A functional group is a molecular module, and the reactivity of that functional group is assumed, within limits, to be the same in a variety of molecules. Functional groups can have a decisive influence on the chemical and physical properties of organic compounds. Molecules are classified based on their functional groups. Alcohols, for example, all have the subunit C-O-H. All alcohols tend to be somewhat hydrophilic, usually form esters, and usually can be converted to the corresponding halides. Most functional groups feature heteroatoms (atoms other than C and H). Organic compounds are classified according to functional groups, alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, etc. Functional groups make the molecule more acidic or basic due to their electronic influence on surrounding parts of the molecule.

As the p&quot;Ka&quot; (aka basicity) of the molecular addition/functional group increases, there is a corresponding dipole, when measured, increases in strength. A dipole directed towards the functional group (higher p&quot;Ka&quot; therefore basic nature of group) points towards it and decreases in strength with increasing distance. Dipole distance (measured in Angstroms) and steric hindrance towards the functional group have an intermolecular and intramolecular effect on the surrounding environment and pH level.

Different functional groups have different p&quot;Ka&quot; values and bond strengths (single, double, triple) leading to increased electrophilicity with lower p&quot;Ka&quot; and increased nucleophile strength with higher p&quot;Ka&quot;. More basic/nucleophilic functional groups desire to attack an electrophilic functional group with a lower p&quot;Ka&quot; on another molecule (intermolecular) or within the same molecule (intramolecular). Any group with a net acidic p&quot;Ka&quot; that gets within range, such as an acyl or carbonyl group is fair game. Since the likelihood of being attacked decreases with an increase in p&quot;Ka&quot;, acyl chloride components with the lowest measured p&quot;Ka&quot; values are most likely to be attacked, followed by carboxylic acids (p&quot;Ka&quot; =4), thiols (13), malonates (13), alcohols (17), aldehydes (20), nitriles (25), esters (25), then amines (35). Amines are very basic, and are great nucleophiles/attackers.

===Aliphatic compounds===

The aliphatic hydrocarbons are subdivided into three groups of homologous series according to their state of saturation:
* alkanes (paraffins): aliphatic hydrocarbons without any double or triple bonds, i.e. just C-C, C-H single bonds
* alkenes (olefins): aliphatic hydrocarbons that contain one or more double bonds, i.e. di-olefins (dienes) or poly-olefins.
* alkynes (acetylenes): aliphatic hydrocarbons which have one or more triple bonds.
The rest of the group is classified according to the functional groups present. Such compounds can be &quot;straight-chain&quot;, branched-chain or cyclic. The degree of branching affects characteristics, such as the octane number or cetane number in petroleum chemistry.

Both saturated (alicyclic) compounds and unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic derivatives. The most stable rings contain five or six carbon atoms, but large rings (macrocycles) and smaller rings are common. The smallest cycloalkane family is the three-membered cyclopropane ((CH2)3). Saturated cyclic compounds contain single bonds only, whereas aromatic rings have an alternating (or conjugated) double bond. Cycloalkanes do not contain multiple bonds, whereas the cycloalkenes and the cycloalkynes do.

===Aromatic compounds===

Aromatic hydrocarbons contain conjugated double bonds. This means that every carbon atom in the ring is sp2 hybridized, allowing for added stability. The most important example is benzene, the structure of which was formulated by Kekulé who first proposed the delocalization or resonance principle for explaining its structure. For &quot;conventional&quot; cyclic compounds, aromaticity is conferred by the presence of 4n + 2 delocalized pi electrons, where n is an integer. Particular instability (antiaromaticity) is conferred by the presence of 4n conjugated pi electrons.

===Heterocyclic compounds===

The characteristics of the cyclic hydrocarbons are again altered if heteroatoms are present, which can exist as either substituents attached externally to the ring (exocyclic) or as a member of the ring itself (endocyclic). In the case of the latter, the ring is termed a heterocycle. Pyridine and furan are examples of aromatic heterocycles while piperidine and tetrahydrofuran are the corresponding alicyclic heterocycles. The heteroatom of heterocyclic molecules is generally oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen, with the latter being particularly common in biochemical systems.

Heterocycles are commonly found in a wide range of products including aniline dyes and medicines. Additionally, they are prevalent in a wide range of biochemical compounds such as alkaloids, vitamins, steroids, and nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, RNA).

Rings can fuse with other rings on an edge to give polycyclic compounds. The purine nucleoside bases are notable polycyclic aromatic heterocycles. Rings can also fuse on a &quot;corner&quot; such that one atom (almost always carbon) has two bonds going to one ring and two to another. Such compounds are termed spiro and are important in several natural products.

=== Polymers ===

One important property of carbon is that it readily forms chains, or networks, that are linked by carbon-carbon (carbon-to-carbon) bonds. The linking process is called polymerization, while the chains, or networks, are called polymers. The source compound is called a monomer.

Two main groups of polymers exist synthetic polymers and biopolymers. Synthetic polymers are artificially manufactured, and are commonly referred to as industrial polymers. Biopolymers occur within a respectfully natural environment, or without human intervention.

===Biomolecules===

Biomolecular chemistry is a major category within organic chemistry which is frequently studied by biochemists. Many complex multi-functional group molecules are important in living organisms. Some are long-chain biopolymers, and these include peptides, DNA, RNA and the polysaccharides such as starches in animals and celluloses in plants. The other main classes are amino acids (monomer building blocks of peptides and proteins), carbohydrates (which includes the polysaccharides), the nucleic acids (which include DNA and RNA as polymers), and the lipids. Besides, animal biochemistry contains many small molecule intermediates which assist in energy production through the Krebs cycle, and produces isoprene, the most common hydrocarbon in animals. Isoprenes in animals form the important steroid structural (cholesterol) and steroid hormone compounds; and in plants form terpenes, terpenoids, some alkaloids, and a class of hydrocarbons called biopolymer polyisoprenoids present in the latex of various species of plants, which is the basis for making rubber. Biologists usually classify the above-mentioned biomolecules into four main groups, i.e., proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Petroleum and its derivatives are considered organic molecules, which is consistent with the fact that this oil comes from the fossilization of living beings, i.e., biomolecules.
See also: peptide synthesis, oligonucleotide synthesis and carbohydrate synthesis.

=== Small molecules ===

In pharmacology, an important group of organic compounds is small molecules, also referred to as &#x27;small organic compounds&#x27;. In this context, a small molecule is a small organic compound that is biologically active but is not a polymer. In practice, small molecules have a molar mass less than approximately 1000 g/mol.

=== Fullerenes ===

Fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, carbon compounds with spheroidal and tubular structures, have stimulated much research into the related field of materials science. The first fullerene was discovered in 1985 by Sir Harold W. Kroto of the United Kingdom and by Richard E. Smalley and Robert F. Curl Jr., of the United States. Using a laser to vaporize graphite rods in an atmosphere of helium gas, these chemists and their assistants obtained cagelike molecules composed of 60 carbon atoms (C60) joined by single and double bonds to form a hollow sphere with 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal faces—a design that resembles a football, or soccer ball. In 1996 the trio was awarded the Nobel Prize for their pioneering efforts. The C60 molecule was named buckminsterfullerene (or, more simply, the buckyball) after the American architect R. Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic dome is constructed on the same structural principles.

=== Others ===
Organic compounds containing bonds of carbon to nitrogen, oxygen and the halogens are not normally grouped separately. Others are sometimes put into major groups within organic chemistry and discussed under titles such as organosulfur chemistry, organometallic chemistry, organophosphorus chemistry and organosilicon chemistry.

== Organic reactions ==

Organic reactions are chemical reactions involving organic compounds. Many of these reactions are associated with functional groups. The general theory of these reactions involves careful analysis of such properties as the electron affinity of key atoms, bond strengths and steric hindrance. These factors can determine the relative stability of short-lived reactive intermediates, which usually directly determine the path of the reaction.

The basic reaction types are: addition reactions, elimination reactions, substitution reactions, pericyclic reactions, rearrangement reactions and redox reactions. An example of a common reaction is a substitution reaction written as:

where X is some functional group and Nu is a nucleophile.

The number of possible organic reactions is infinite. However, certain general patterns are observed that can be used to describe many common or useful reactions. Each reaction has a stepwise reaction mechanism that explains how it happens in sequence—although the detailed description of steps is not always clear from a list of reactants alone.

The stepwise course of any given reaction mechanism can be represented using arrow pushing techniques in which curved arrows are used to track the movement of electrons as starting materials transition through intermediates to final products.

== Organic synthesis ==
Synthetic organic chemistry is an applied science as it borders engineering, the &quot;design, analysis, and/or construction of works for practical purposes&quot;. Organic synthesis of a novel compound is a problem-solving task, where a synthesis is designed for a target molecule by selecting optimal reactions from optimal starting materials. Complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule. The synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule. For example, a carbonyl compound can be used as a nucleophile by converting it into an enolate, or as an electrophile; the combination of the two is called the aldol reaction. Designing practically useful syntheses always requires conducting the actual synthesis in the laboratory. The scientific practice of creating novel synthetic routes for complex molecules is called total synthesis.

Strategies to design a synthesis include retrosynthesis, popularized by E.J. Corey, which starts with the target molecule and splices it to pieces according to known reactions. The pieces, or the proposed precursors, receive the same treatment, until available and ideally inexpensive starting materials are reached. Then, the retrosynthesis is written in the opposite direction to give the synthesis. A &quot;synthetic tree&quot; can be constructed because each compound and also each precursor has multiple syntheses.

<doc id="22209" wikidata="Q43091" url="?curid=22209" title="Orthography">
<text>An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language, including norms of spelling, punctuation, word boundaries, capitalization, hyphenation, and emphasis.

Most national and international languages have an established writing system that has undergone substantial standardization, thus exhibiting less dialect variation than the spoken language. These processes can fossilize pronunciation patterns that are no longer routinely observed in speech (e.g. &quot;would&quot; and &quot;should&quot;); they can also reflect deliberate efforts to introduce variability for the sake of national identity, as seen in Noah Webster&#x27;s efforts to introduce easily noticeable differences between American and British spelling (e.g. &quot;honor&quot; and &quot;honour&quot;).

Orthographic norms develop through social and political influence at various levels, such as encounters with print in education, the workplace, and the state. Some nations have established language academies in an attempt to regulate aspects of the national language, including its orthography—such as the Académie Française in France and the Royal Spanish Academy in Spain. No such authority exists for most languages, including English. Some non-state organizations, such as newspapers of record and academic journals, choose greater orthographic homogeneity by enforcing a particular style guide or spelling standard such as Oxford spelling.

== Terminology ==
The English word &quot;orthography&quot; is first attested in the 15th century, ultimately from ( &#x27;correct&#x27;) and ( &#x27;to write&#x27;).

Orthography in phonetic writing systems is often concerned with matters of spelling, i.e. the correspondence between written graphemes and the phonemes found in speech. Other elements that may be considered part of orthography include hyphenation, capitalization, word boundaries, emphasis, and punctuation. Thus, &quot;orthography&quot; describes or defines the symbols used in writing, and the conventions that regulate their use.

Most natural languages developed as oral languages and writing systems have usually been crafted or adapted as ways of representing the spoken language. The rules for doing this tend to become standardized for a given language, leading to the development of an orthography that is generally considered &quot;correct&quot;. In linguistics, &quot;orthography&quot; often refers to any method of writing a language without judgement as to right and wrong, with a scientific understanding that orthographic standardization exists on a spectrum of strength of convention. The original sense of the word, though, implies a dichotomy of correct and incorrect, and the word is still most often used to refer specifically to a standardized prescriptive manner of writing. A distinction is made between emic and etic viewpoints, with the emic approach taking account of perceptions of correctness among language users, and the etic approach being purely descriptive, considering only the empirical qualities of any system as used.

== Units and notation ==

Orthographic units, such as letters of an alphabet, are conceptualized as graphemes. These are a type of abstraction, analogous to the phonemes of spoken languages; different physical forms of written symbols are considered to represent the same grapheme if the differences between them are not significant for meaning. Thus, a grapheme can be regarded as an abstraction of a collection of glyphs that are all functionally equivalent. For example, in written English (or other languages using the Latin alphabet), there are two different physical representations (glyphs) of the lowercase Latin letter &quot;a&quot;: and . Since the substitution of either of them for the other cannot change the meaning of a word, they are considered to be allographs of the same grapheme, which can be written . The italic and boldface forms are also allographic.

Graphemes or sequences of them are sometimes placed between angle brackets, as in or . This distinguishes them from phonemic transcription, which is placed between slashes (, ), and from phonetic transcription, which is placed between square brackets (, ).

== Types ==
The writing systems on which orthographies are based can be divided into a number of types, depending on what type of unit each symbol serves to represent. The principal types are &quot;logographic&quot; (with symbols representing words or morphemes), &quot;syllabic&quot; (with symbols representing syllables), and &quot;alphabetic&quot; (with symbols roughly representing phonemes). Many writing systems combine features of more than one of these types, and a number of detailed classifications have been proposed. Japanese is an example of a writing system that can be written using a combination of logographic kanji characters and syllabic hiragana and katakana characters; as with many non-alphabetic languages, alphabetic romaji characters may also be used as needed.

== Correspondence with pronunciation ==
Orthographies that use alphabets and syllabaries are based on the principle that written graphemes correspond to units of sound of the spoken language: phonemes in the former case, and syllables in the latter. In virtually all cases, this correspondence is not exact. Different languages&#x27; orthographies offer different degrees of correspondence between spelling and pronunciation. English, French, Danish, and Thai orthographies, for example, are highly irregular, whereas the orthographies of languages such as Russian, German, Spanish, Finnish, Turkish, and Serbo-Croatian represent pronunciation much more faithfully.

An orthography in which the correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are highly complex or inconsistent is called a &quot;deep orthography&quot; (or less formally, the language is said to have &quot;irregular spelling&quot;). An orthography with relatively simple and consistent correspondences is called &quot;shallow&quot; (and the language has &quot;regular spelling&quot;).

One of the main reasons why spelling and pronunciation diverge is that sound changes taking place in the spoken language are not always reflected in the orthography, and hence spellings correspond to historical rather than present-day pronunciation. One consequence of this is that many spellings come to reflect a word&#x27;s morphophonemic structure rather than its purely phonemic structure (for example, the English regular past tense morpheme is consistently spelled &quot;-ed&quot; in spite of its different pronunciations in various words). This is discussed further at .

The syllabaries in the Japanese writing system (hiragana and katakana) are examples of almost perfectly shallow orthographies—the kana correspond with almost perfect consistency to the spoken syllables, although with a few exceptions where symbols reflect historical or morphophonemic features: notably the use of ぢ &quot;ji&quot; and づ &quot;zu&quot; (rather than じ &quot;ji&quot; and ず &quot;zu&quot;, their pronunciation in standard Tokyo dialect) when the character is a voicing of an underlying ち or つ (see rendaku), and the use of は, を, and へ to represent the sounds わ, お, and え, as relics of historical kana usage.

Korean hangul and Tibetan scripts were also originally extremely shallow orthographies, but as a representation of the modern language those frequently also reflect morphophonemic features.

=== Defective orthographies ===
An orthography based on a correspondence to phonemes may sometimes lack characters to represent all the phonemic distinctions in the language. This is called a defective orthography. An example in English is the lack of any indication of stress. Another is the digraph , which represents two different phonemes (as in &quot;then&quot; and &quot;thin&quot;) and replaced the old letters and . A more systematic example is that of abjads like the Arabic and Hebrew alphabets, in which the short vowels are normally left unwritten and must be inferred by the reader.

When an alphabet is borrowed from its original language for use with a new language—as has been done with the Latin alphabet for many languages, or Japanese katakana for non-Japanese words—it often proves defective in representing the new language&#x27;s phonemes. Sometimes this problem is addressed by the use of such devices as digraphs (such as and in English, where pairs of letters represent single sounds), diacritics (like the caron on the letters and , which represent those same sounds in Czech), or the addition of completely new symbols (as some languages have introduced the letter to the Latin alphabet) or of symbols from another alphabet, such as the rune in Icelandic.

After the classical period, Greek developed a lowercase letter system with diacritics to enable foreigners to learn pronunciation and grammatical features. As pronunciation of letters changed over time, the diacritics were reduced to representing the stressed syllable. In Modern Greek typesetting, this system has been simplified to only have a single accent to indicate which syllable is stressed.

<text>In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is larger than or equal to the size of the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a &quot;one-time pad&quot;). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition.

The resulting ciphertext will be impossible to decrypt or break if the following four conditions are met:

# The key must be at least as long as the plaintext.
# The key must be truly random. 
# The key must never be reused in whole or in part.
# The key must be kept completely secret by the communicating parties.

It has also been mathematically proven that any cipher with the property of perfect secrecy must use keys with effectively the same requirements as OTP keys. Digital versions of one-time pad ciphers have been used by nations for critical diplomatic and military communication, but the problems of secure key distribution make them impractical for most applications.

First described by Frank Miller in 1882, the one-time pad was re-invented in 1917. On July 22, 1919, U.S. Patent 1,310,719 was issued to Gilbert Vernam for the XOR operation used for the encryption of a one-time pad. Derived from his &quot;Vernam cipher&quot;, the system was a cipher that combined a message with a key read from a punched tape. In its original form, Vernam&#x27;s system was vulnerable because the key tape was a loop, which was reused whenever the loop made a full cycle. One-time use came later, when Joseph Mauborgne recognized that if the key tape were totally random, then cryptanalysis would be impossible.

The &quot;pad&quot; part of the name comes from early implementations where the key material was distributed as a pad of paper, allowing the current top sheet to be torn off and destroyed after use. For concealment the pad was sometimes so small that a powerful magnifying glass was required to use it. The KGB used pads of such size that they could fit in the palm of a hand, or in a walnut shell. To increase security, one-time pads were sometimes printed onto sheets of highly flammable nitrocellulose, so that they could easily be burned after use.

There is some ambiguity to the term &quot;Vernam cipher&quot; because some sources use &quot;Vernam cipher&quot; and &quot;one-time pad&quot; synonymously, while others refer to any additive stream cipher as a &quot;Vernam cipher&quot;, including those based on a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).

==History==
Frank Miller in 1882 was the first to describe the one-time pad system for securing telegraphy.

The next one-time pad system was electrical. In 1917, Gilbert Vernam (of AT&amp;T Corporation) invented and later patented in 1919 () a cipher based on teleprinter technology. Each character in a message was electrically combined with a character on a punched paper tape key. Joseph Mauborgne (then a captain in the U.S. Army and later chief of the Signal Corps) recognized that the character sequence on the key tape could be completely random and that, if so, cryptanalysis would be more difficult. Together they invented the first one-time tape system.

The next development was the paper pad system. Diplomats had long used codes and ciphers for confidentiality and to minimize telegraph costs. For the codes, words and phrases were converted to groups of numbers (typically 4 or 5 digits) using a dictionary-like codebook. For added security, secret numbers could be combined with (usually modular addition) each code group before transmission, with the secret numbers being changed periodically (this was called superencryption). In the early 1920s, three German cryptographers (Werner Kunze, Rudolf Schauffler, and Erich Langlotz), who were involved in breaking such systems, realized that they could never be broken if a separate randomly chosen additive number was used for every code group. They had duplicate paper pads printed with lines of random number groups. Each page had a serial number and eight lines. Each line had six 5-digit numbers. A page would be used as a work sheet to encode a message and then destroyed. The serial number of the page would be sent with the encoded message. The recipient would reverse the procedure and then destroy his copy of the page. The German foreign office put this system into operation by 1923.

A separate notion was the use of a one-time pad of letters to encode plaintext directly as in the example below. Leo Marks describes inventing such a system for the British Special Operations Executive during World War II, though he suspected at the time that it was already known in the highly compartmentalized world of cryptography, as for instance at Bletchley Park.

The final discovery was made by information theorist Claude Shannon in the 1940s who recognized and proved the theoretical significance of the one-time pad system. Shannon delivered his results in a classified report in 1945 and published them openly in 1949. At the same time, Soviet information theorist Vladimir Kotelnikov had independently proved the absolute security of the one-time pad; his results were delivered in 1941 in a report that apparently remains classified.

There also exists a quantum analogue of the one time pad, which can be used to exchange quantum states along a one-way quantum channel with perfect secrecy, which is sometimes used in quantum computing. It can be shown that a shared secret of at least 2n classical bits is required to exchange an n-qubit quantum state along a one-way quantum channel (by analogue with the result that a key of n bits is required to exchange an n bit message with perfect secrecy). A scheme proposed in 2000 achieves this bound. One way to implement this quantum one-time pad is by dividing the 2n bit key into n pairs of bits. To encrypt the state, for each pair of bits i in the key, one would apply an X gate to qubit i of the state if and only if the first bit of the pair is 1, and apply a Z gate to qubit i of the state if and only if the second bit of the pair is 1. Decryption involves applying this transformation again, since X and Z are their own inverses. This can be shown to be perfectly secret in a quantum setting.

== Example ==

Suppose Alice wishes to send the message codice_1 to Bob. Assume two pads of paper containing identical random sequences of letters were somehow previously produced and securely issued to both. Alice chooses the appropriate unused page from the pad. The way to do this is normally arranged for in advance, as for instance &quot;use the 12th sheet on 1 May&quot;, or &quot;use the next available sheet for the next message&quot;.

The material on the selected sheet is the &quot;key&quot; for this message. Each letter from the pad will be combined in a predetermined way with one letter of the message. (It is common, but not required, to assign each letter a numerical value, e.g., codice_2 is 0, codice_3 is 1, and so on.)

In this example, the technique is to combine the key and the message using modular addition, not unlike the Vigenère cipher. The numerical values of corresponding message and key letters are added together, modulo 26. So, if key material begins with codice_4 and the message is codice_1, then the coding would be done as follows:

 h e l l o message
 7 (h) 4 (e) 11 (l) 11 (l) 14 (o) message
 + 23 (X) 12 (M) 2 (C) 10 (K) 11 (L) key
 = 30 16 13 21 25 message + key
 = 4 (E) 16 (Q) 13 (N) 21 (V) 25 (Z) (message + key) mod 26
 E Q N V Z → ciphertext

If a number is larger than 25, then the remainder after subtraction of 26 is taken in modular arithmetic fashion. This simply means that if the computations &quot;go past&quot; Z, the sequence starts again at A.

The ciphertext to be sent to Bob is thus codice_6. Bob uses the matching key page and the same process, but in reverse, to obtain the plaintext. Here the key is &quot;subtracted&quot; from the ciphertext, again using modular arithmetic:

 E Q N V Z ciphertext
 4 (E) 16 (Q) 13 (N) 21 (V) 25 (Z) ciphertext
 − 23 (X) 12 (M) 2 (C) 10 (K) 11 (L) key
 = −19 4 11 11 14 ciphertext – key
 = 7 (h) 4 (e) 11 (l) 11 (l) 14 (o) ciphertext – key (mod 26)
 h e l l o → message

Similar to the above, if a number is negative, then 26 is added to make the number zero or higher.

Thus Bob recovers Alice&#x27;s plaintext, the message codice_1. Both Alice and Bob destroy the key sheet immediately after use, thus preventing reuse and an attack against the cipher. The KGB often issued its agents one-time pads printed on tiny sheets of flash paper, paper chemically converted to nitrocellulose, which burns almost instantly and leaves no ash.

The classical one-time pad of espionage used actual pads of minuscule, easily concealed paper, a sharp pencil, and some mental arithmetic. The method can be implemented now as a software program, using data files as input (plaintext), output (ciphertext) and key material (the required random sequence). The exclusive or (XOR) operation is often used to combine the plaintext and the key elements, and is especially attractive on computers since it is usually a native machine instruction and is therefore very fast. It is, however, difficult to ensure that the key material is actually random, is used only once, never becomes known to the opposition, and is completely destroyed after use. The auxiliary parts of a software one-time pad implementation present real challenges: secure handling/transmission of plaintext, truly random keys, and one-time-only use of the key.

=== Attempt at cryptanalysis ===
To continue the example from above, suppose Eve intercepts Alice&#x27;s ciphertext: codice_6. If Eve tried every possible key, she would find that the key codice_4 would produce the plaintext codice_1, but she would also find that the key codice_11 would produce the plaintext codice_12, an equally plausible message:
 4 (E) 16 (Q) 13 (N) 21 (V) 25 (Z) ciphertext
 − 19 (T) 16 (Q) 20 (U) 17 (R) 8 (I) possible key
 = −15 0 −7 4 17 ciphertext-key
 = 11 (l) 0 (a) 19 (t) 4 (e) 17 (r) ciphertext-key (mod 26)
In fact, it is possible to &quot;decrypt&quot; out of the ciphertext any message whatsoever with the same number of characters, simply by using a different key, and there is no information in the ciphertext that will allow Eve to choose among the various possible readings of the ciphertext.

If the key is not truly random, it is possible to use statistical analysis to determine which of the plausible keys is the &quot;least&quot; random and therefore more likely to be the correct one. If a key is reused, it will noticeably be the only key that produces sensible plaintexts from both ciphertexts (the chances of some random &quot;incorrect&quot; key also producing two sensible plaintexts are very slim).

== Perfect secrecy ==
One-time pads are &quot;information-theoretically secure&quot; in that the encrypted message (i.e., the ciphertext) provides no information about the original message to a cryptanalyst (except the maximum possible length of the message). This is a very strong notion of security first developed during WWII by Claude Shannon and proved, mathematically, to be true for the one-time pad by Shannon at about the same time. His result was published in the &quot;Bell System Technical Journal&quot; in 1949. If properly used, one-time pads are secure in this sense even against adversaries with infinite computational power.

Shannon proved, using information theoretic considerations, that the one-time pad has a property he termed &quot;perfect secrecy&quot;; that is, the ciphertext &quot;C&quot; gives absolutely no additional information about the plaintext. This is because (intuitively), given a truly uniformly random key that is used only once, a ciphertext can be translated into &quot;any&quot; plaintext of the same length, and all are equally likely. Thus, the &quot;a priori&quot; probability of a plaintext message &quot;M&quot; is the same as the &quot;a posteriori&quot; probability of a plaintext message &quot;M&quot; given the corresponding ciphertext.

Conventional symmetric encryption algorithms use complex patterns of substitution and transpositions. For the best of these currently in use, it is not known whether there can be a cryptanalytic procedure that can efficiently reverse (or even partially reverse) these transformations without knowing the key used during encryption. Asymmetric encryption algorithms depend on mathematical problems that are thought to be difficult to solve, such as integer factorization or the discrete logarithm. However, there is no proof that these problems are hard, and a mathematical breakthrough could make existing systems vulnerable to attack.

Given perfect secrecy, in contrast to conventional symmetric encryption, the one-time pad is immune even to brute-force attacks. Trying all keys simply yields all plaintexts, all equally likely to be the actual plaintext. Even with a partially known plaintext, brute-force attacks cannot be used, since an attacker is unable to gain any information about the parts of the key needed to decrypt the rest of the message. The parts of the plaintext that are known will reveal &quot;only&quot; the parts of the key corresponding to them, and they correspond on a strictly one-to-one basis; a uniformly random key&#x27;s bits will be independent.

Quantum cryptography and post-quantum cryptography involve studying the impact of quantum computers on information security.
Quantum computers have been shown by Peter Shor and others to be much faster at solving some problems that the security of traditional asymmetric encryption algorithms depends on. The cryptographic algorithms that depend on these problems&#x27; difficulty would be rendered obsolete with a powerful enough quantum computer.
One-time pads, however, would remain secure, as perfect secrecy does not depend on assumptions about the computational resources of an attacker.

== Problems ==
Despite Shannon&#x27;s proof of its security, the one-time pad has serious drawbacks in practice because it requires:
* Truly random, as opposed to &quot;pseudorandom&quot;, one-time pad values, which is a non-trivial requirement. Random number generation in computers is often difficult, and pseudorandom number generators are often used for their speed and usefulness for most applications. True random number generators exist, but are typically slower and more specialized.
* Secure generation and exchange of the one-time pad values, which must be at least as long as the message. This is important because the security of the one-time pad depends on the security of the one-time pad exchange. If an attacker is able to intercept the one-time pad value, they can decrypt messages sent using the one-time pad.
* Careful treatment to make sure that the one-time pad values continue to remain secret and are disposed of correctly, preventing any reuse (partially or entirely)—hence &quot;one-time&quot;. Problems with data remanence can make it difficult to completely erase computer media.

One-time pads solve few current practical problems in cryptography. High-quality ciphers are widely available and their security is not currently considered a major worry. Such ciphers are almost always easier to employ than one-time pads because the amount of key material that must be properly and securely generated, distributed and stored is far smaller. Additionally, public key cryptography overcomes the problem of key distribution.

===True randomness===
High-quality random numbers are difficult to generate. The random number generation functions in most programming language libraries are not suitable for cryptographic use. Even those generators that are suitable for normal cryptographic use, including /dev/random and many hardware random number generators, may make some use of cryptographic functions whose security has not been proven. An example of a technique for generating pure randomness is measuring radioactive emissions.

In particular, one-time use is absolutely necessary. For example, if formula_1 and formula_2 represent two distinct plaintext messages and they are each encrypted by a common key formula_3, then the respective ciphertexts are given by:

:formula_4
:formula_5

where formula_6 means XOR. If an attacker were to have both ciphertexts formula_7 and formula_8, then simply taking the XOR of formula_7 and formula_8 yields the XOR of the two plaintexts formula_11. (This is because taking the XOR of the common key formula_3 with itself yields a constant bitstream of zeros.) formula_11 is then the equivalent of a running key cipher.

If both plaintexts are in a natural language (e.g., English or Russian), each stands a very high chance of being recovered by heuristic cryptanalysis, with possibly a few ambiguities. Of course, a longer message can only be broken for the portion that overlaps a shorter message, plus perhaps a little more by completing a word or phrase. The most famous exploit of this vulnerability occurred with the Venona project.

===Key distribution===
Because the pad, like all shared secrets, must be passed and kept secure, and the pad has to be at least as long as the message, there is often no point in using a one-time pad, as one can simply send the plain text instead of the pad (as both can be the same size and have to be sent securely). However, once a very long pad has been securely sent (e.g., a computer disk full of random data), it can be used for numerous future messages, until the sum of the messages&#x27; sizes equals the size of the pad. Quantum key distribution also proposes a solution to this problem, assuming fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Distributing very long one-time pad keys is inconvenient and usually poses a significant security risk. The pad is essentially the encryption key, but unlike keys for modern ciphers, it must be extremely long and is far too difficult for humans to remember. Storage media such as thumb drives, DVD-Rs or personal digital audio players can be used to carry a very large one-time-pad from place to place in a non-suspicious way, but the need to transport the pad physically is a burden compared to the key negotiation protocols of a modern public-key cryptosystem. Such media cannot reliably be erased securely by any means short of physical destruction (e.g., incineration). A 4.7 GB DVD-R full of one-time-pad data, if shredded into particles in size, leaves over 4 megabits of data on each particle. In addition, the risk of compromise during transit (for example, a pickpocket swiping, copying and replacing the pad) is likely to be much greater in practice than the likelihood of compromise for a cipher such as AES. Finally, the effort needed to manage one-time pad key material scales very badly for large networks of communicants—the number of pads required goes up as the square of the number of users freely exchanging messages. For communication between only two persons, or a star network topology, this is less of a problem.

The key material must be securely disposed of after use, to ensure the key material is never reused and to protect the messages sent. Because the key material must be transported from one endpoint to another, and persist until the message is sent or received, it can be more vulnerable to forensic recovery than the transient plaintext it protects (because of possible data remanence).

===Authentication===
As traditionally used, one-time pads provide no message authentication, the lack of which can pose a security threat in real-world systems. For example, an attacker who knows that the message contains &quot;meet jane and me tomorrow at three thirty pm&quot; can derive the corresponding codes of the pad directly from the two known elements (the encrypted text and the known plaintext). The attacker can then replace that text by any other text of exactly the same length, such as &quot;three thirty meeting is cancelled, stay home&quot;. The attacker&#x27;s knowledge of the one-time pad is limited to this byte length, which must be maintained for any other content of the message to remain valid. This is different from malleability where the plaintext is not necessarily known. Without knowing the message, the attacker can also flip bits in a message sent with a one-time pad, without the recipient being able to detect it. Because of their similarities, attacks on one-time pads are similar to attacks on stream ciphers.

Standard techniques to prevent this, such as the use of a message authentication code can be used along with a one-time pad system to prevent such attacks, as can classical methods such as variable length padding and Russian copulation, but they all lack the perfect security the OTP itself has. Universal hashing provides a way to authenticate messages up to an arbitrary security bound (i.e., for any , a large enough hash ensures that even a computationally unbounded attacker&#x27;s likelihood of successful forgery is less than &quot;p&quot;), but this uses additional random data from the pad, and some of these techniques remove the possibility of implementing the system without a computer.

=== Common implementation errors ===

Due to its relative simplicity of implementation, and due to its promise of perfect secrecy, one-time-pad enjoys high popularity among students learning about cryptography, especially as it is often the first algorithm to be presented and implemented during a course. Such &quot;first&quot; implementations often break the requirements for information theoretical security in one or more ways:
* The pad is generated via some algorithm, that expands one or more small values into a longer &quot;one-time-pad&quot;. This applies equally to all algorithms, from insecure basic mathematical operations like square root decimal expansions, to complex, cryptographically secure pseudo-random random number generators (CSPRNGs). None of these implementations are one-time-pads, but stream ciphers by definition. All one-time pads must be generated by a non-algorithmic process, e.g. by a hardware random number generator.
* The pad is exchanged using non-information-theoretically secure methods. If the one-time-pad is encrypted with a non-information theoretically secure algorithm for delivery, the security of the cryptosystem is only as secure as the insecure delivery mechanism. A common flawed delivery mechanism for one-time-pad is a standard hybrid cryptosystem that relies on symmetric key cryptography for pad encryption, and asymmetric cryptography for symmetric key delivery. Common secure methods for one-time pad delivery are quantum key distribution, a sneakernet or courier service, or a dead drop.
* The implementation does not feature an unconditionally secure authentication mechanism such as a one-time MAC.
* The pad is reused (exploited during the Venona project, for example).
* The pad is not destroyed immediately after use.

==Uses==
=== Applicability ===

Despite its problems, the one-time-pad retains some practical interest. In some hypothetical espionage situations, the one-time pad might be useful because encryption and decryption can be computed by hand with only pencil and paper. Nearly all other high quality ciphers are entirely impractical without computers. In the modern world, however, computers (such as those embedded in mobile phones) are so ubiquitous that possessing a computer suitable for performing conventional encryption (for example, a phone that can run concealed cryptographic software) will usually not attract suspicion.
* The one-time-pad is the optimum cryptosystem with theoretically perfect secrecy.
* The one-time-pad is one of the most practical methods of encryption where one or both parties must do all work by hand, without the aid of a computer. This made it important in the pre-computer era, and it could conceivably still be useful in situations where possession of a computer is illegal or incriminating or where trustworthy computers are not available.
* One-time pads are practical in situations where two parties in a secure environment must be able to depart from one another and communicate from two separate secure environments with perfect secrecy.
* The one-time-pad can be used in superencryption.
* The algorithm most commonly associated with quantum key distribution is the one-time pad.
* The one-time pad is mimicked by stream ciphers.
* Numbers stations often send messages encrypted with a one-time pad.

=== Quantum and post-quantum cryptography ===
A common use of the one-time pad in quantum cryptography is being used in association with quantum key distribution (QKD). QKD is typically associated with the one-time pad because it provides a way of distributing a long shared secret key securely and efficiently (assuming the existence of practical quantum networking hardware). A QKD algorithm uses properties of quantum mechanical systems to let two parties agree on a shared, uniformly random string. Algorithms for QKD, such as BB84, are also able to determine whether an adversarial party has been attempting to intercept key material, and allow for a shared secret key to be agreed upon with relatively few messages exchanged and relatively low computational overhead. At a high level, the schemes work by taking advantage of the destructive way quantum states are measured to exchange a secret and detect tampering. In the original BB84 paper, it was proven that the one-time pad, with keys distributed via QKD, is a perfectly secure encryption scheme. However, this result depends on the QKD scheme being implemented correctly in practice. Attacks on real-world QKD systems exist. For instance, many systems do not send a single photon (or other object in the desired quantum state) per bit of the key because of practical limitations, and an attacker could intercept and measure some of the photons associated with a message, gaining information about the key (i.e. leaking information about the pad), while passing along unmeasured photons corresponding to the same bit of the key. Combining QKD with a one-time pad can also loosen the requirements for key reuse. In 1982, Bennett and Brassard showed that if a QKD protocol does not detect that an adversary was trying to intercept an exchanged key, then the key can safely be reused while preserving perfect secrecy.

The one-time pad is an example of post-quantum cryptography, because perfect secrecy is a definition of security that does not depend on the computational resources of the adversary. Consequently, an adversary with a quantum computer would still not be able to gain any more information about a message encrypted with a one time pad than an adversary with just a classical computer.

=== Historical uses ===

One-time pads have been used in special circumstances since the early 1900s. In 1923, they were employed for diplomatic communications by the German diplomatic establishment. The Weimar Republic Diplomatic Service began using the method in about 1920. The breaking of poor Soviet cryptography by the British, with messages made public for political reasons in two instances in the 1920s (ARCOS case), appear to have caused the Soviet Union to adopt one-time pads for some purposes by around 1930. KGB spies are also known to have used pencil and paper one-time pads more recently. Examples include Colonel Rudolf Abel, who was arrested and convicted in New York City in the 1950s, and the &#x27;Krogers&#x27; (i.e., Morris and Lona Cohen), who were arrested and convicted of espionage in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s. Both were found with physical one-time pads in their possession.

A number of nations have used one-time pad systems for their sensitive traffic. Leo Marks reports that the British Special Operations Executive used one-time pads in World War II to encode traffic between its offices. One-time pads for use with its overseas agents were introduced late in the war. A few British one-time tape cipher machines include the Rockex and Noreen. The German Stasi Sprach Machine was also capable of using one time tape that East Germany, Russia, and even Cuba used to send encrypted messages to their agents.

The World War II voice scrambler SIGSALY was also a form of one-time system. It added noise to the signal at one end and removed it at the other end. The noise was distributed to the channel ends in the form of large shellac records that were manufactured in unique pairs. There were both starting synchronization and longer-term phase drift problems that arose and had to be solved before the system could be used.

The hotline between Moscow and Washington D.C., established in 1963 after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, used teleprinters protected by a commercial one-time tape system. Each country prepared the keying tapes used to encode its messages and delivered them via their embassy in the other country. A unique advantage of the OTP in this case was that neither country had to reveal more sensitive encryption methods to the other.

U.S. Army Special Forces used one-time pads in Vietnam. By using Morse code with one-time pads and continuous wave radio transmission (the carrier for Morse code), they achieved both secrecy and reliable communications.

Starting in 1988, the African National Congress (ANC) used disk-based one-time pads as part of a secure communication system between ANC leaders outside South Africa and in-country operatives as part of Operation Vula, a successful effort to build a resistance network inside South Africa. Random numbers on the disk were erased after use. A Belgian flight attendant acted as courier to bring in the pad disks. A regular resupply of new disks was needed as they were used up fairly quickly. One problem with the system was that it could not be used for secure data storage. Later Vula added a stream cipher keyed by book codes to solve this problem.

A related notion is the one-time code—a signal, used only once; e.g., &quot;Alpha&quot; for &quot;mission completed&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot; for &quot;mission failed&quot; or even &quot;Torch&quot; for &quot;Allied invasion of French Northern Africa&quot; cannot be &quot;decrypted&quot; in any reasonable sense of the word. Understanding the message will require additional information, often &#x27;depth&#x27; of repetition, or some traffic analysis. However, such strategies (though often used by real operatives, and baseball coaches) are not a cryptographic one-time pad in any significant sense.

===NSA===
At least into the 1970s, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) produced a variety of manual one-time pads, both general purpose and specialized, with 86,000 one-time pads produced in fiscal year 1972. Special purpose pads were produced for what the NSA called &quot;pro forma&quot; systems, where &quot;the basic framework, form or format of every message text is identical or nearly so; the same kind of information, message after message, is to be presented in the same order, and only specific values, like numbers, change with each message.&quot; Examples included nuclear launch messages and radio direction finding reports (COMUS).

General purpose pads were produced in several formats, a simple list of random letters (DIANA) or just numbers (CALYPSO), tiny pads for covert agents (MICKEY MOUSE), and pads designed for more rapid encoding of short messages, at the cost of lower density. One example, ORION, had 50 rows of plaintext alphabets on one side and the corresponding random cipher text letters on the other side. By placing a sheet on top of a piece of carbon paper with the carbon face up, one could circle one letter in each row on one side and the corresponding letter on the other side would be circled by the carbon paper. Thus one ORION sheet could quickly encode or decode a message up to 50 characters long. Production of ORION pads required printing both sides in exact registration, a difficult process, so NSA switched to another pad format, MEDEA, with 25 rows of paired alphabets and random characters. (&quot;See&quot; for illustrations.)

The NSA also built automated systems for the &quot;centralized headquarters of CIA and Special Forces units so that they can efficiently process the many separate one-time pad messages to and from individual pad holders in the field&quot;.

During World War II and into the 1950s, the U.S. made extensive use of one-time tape systems. In addition to providing confidentiality, circuits secured by one-time tape ran continually, even when there was no traffic, thus protecting against traffic analysis. In 1955, NSA produced some 1,660,000 rolls of one time tape. Each roll was 8 inches in diameter, contained 100,000 characters, lasted 166 minutes and cost $4.55 to produce. By 1972, only 55,000 rolls were produced, as one-time tapes were replaced by rotor machines such as SIGTOT, and later by electronic devices based on shift registers. The NSA describes one-time tape systems like 5-UCO and SIGTOT as being used for intelligence traffic until the introduction of the electronic cipher based KW-26 in 1957.

===Exploits===
While one-time pads provide perfect secrecy if generated and used properly, small mistakes can lead to successful cryptanalysis:
* In 1944–1945, the U.S. Army&#x27;s Signals Intelligence Service was able to solve a one-time pad system used by the German Foreign Office for its high-level traffic, codenamed GEE. GEE was insecure because the pads were not sufficiently random—the machine used to generate the pads produced predictable output.
* In 1945, the US discovered that Canberra–Moscow messages were being encrypted first using a code-book and then using a one-time pad. However, the one-time pad used was the same one used by Moscow for Washington, D.C.–Moscow messages. Combined with the fact that some of the Canberra–Moscow messages included known British government documents, this allowed some of the encrypted messages to be broken.
* One-time pads were employed by Soviet espionage agencies for covert communications with agents and agent controllers. Analysis has shown that these pads were generated by typists using actual typewriters. This method is not truly random, as it makes the pads more likely to contain certain convenient key sequences more frequently. This proved to be generally effective because the pads were still somewhat unpredictable because the typists were not following rules, and different typists produced different patterns of pads. Without copies of the key material used, only some defect in the generation method or reuse of keys offered much hope of cryptanalysis. Beginning in the late 1940s, US and UK intelligence agencies were able to break some of the Soviet one-time pad traffic to Moscow during WWII as a result of errors made in generating and distributing the key material. One suggestion is that Moscow Centre personnel were somewhat rushed by the presence of German troops just outside Moscow in late 1941 and early 1942, and they produced more than one copy of the same key material during that period. This decades-long effort was finally codenamed VENONA (BRIDE had been an earlier name); it produced a considerable amount of information. Even so, only a small percentage of the intercepted messages were either fully or partially decrypted (a few thousand out of several hundred thousand).
* The one-time tape systems used by the U.S. employed electromechanical mixers to combine bits from the message and the one-time tape. These mixers radiated considerable electromagnetic energy that could be picked up by an adversary at some distance from the encryption equipment. This effect, first noticed by Bell Labs during World War II, could allow interception and recovery of the plaintext of messages being transmitted, a vulnerability code-named Tempest.

<text>Oelde () is a town in the district of Warendorf, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located near Beckum.

==Geography==

===Division of the town===

Oelde consists of 5 districts:
* Oelde
* Stromberg
* Lette
* Sünninghausen
* Kirchspiel (with farming communities)
** Keitlinghausen
** Ahmenhorst
** Menninghausen

===Neighbouring places===

The neighboring municipalities and cities are clockwise, starting in the north:
* Beelen
* Herzebrock-Clarholz
* Rheda-Wiedenbrück
* Langenberg
* Wadersloh
* Beckum
* Ennigerloh

==International relations==
Oelde is (not officially) twinned with:
* Niesky (Saxony, Germany)

==History==

The name Oelde was first mentioned in a document around 890 as &quot;Ulithi im Dreingau&quot; in the Urbar of the Werden monastery.

In 1457 a conflagration destroyed the city. In 1498, after the reconstruction, Oelde had 750 citizens. Another fire raged in 1605 and destroyed a total of 18 houses, barns and the town hall.

In 1939, Oelde was given its own exit when the motorway A 2 was built.

In the 1950s and 1960s, a high number of visitors came to Oelde when diplomats accepted the invitation of the Federal Presidents Heuss and Lübke to hunt small game in the state forest &quot;Geisterholz&quot;. These events were commonly known as &quot;diplomatic hunts.&quot;

In 2001 Oelde hosted one of the most important flower shows ever organized in Westphalia with more than 2.2 million visitors. Since then, the city garden, included in the exhibition grounds and embellished for the occasion, has been commercially exploited under the name &quot;Park of the four seasons&quot; (Vier-Jahreszeiten-Park).

==Economy==
Oelde is a centre of metal and lumber production, publishing, and also higher education through its nursing college.
It is also home to the headquarters of GEA (Westfalia Separator), a manufacturer of centrifuges and dairy machines and the headquarters of Haver &amp; Boecker, a manufacturer of wire weaving.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Oelde is connected to the Bundesautobahn 2.

===Railways===

The Hamm–Minden railway connects Oelde station to the German rail network. The line is served by the Rhein-Weser-Express and the Ems-Börde-Bahn every hour.

<text>In mathematics, an operator is generally a mapping or function that acts on elements of a space to produce elements of another space (possibly and sometimes required to be the same space). There is no general definition of an &quot;operator&quot;, but the term is often used in place of &quot;function&quot; when the domain is a set of functions or other structured objects. Also, the domain of an operator is often difficult to characterize explicitly (for example in the case of an integral operator), and may be extended so as to act on related objects (an operator that acts on functions may act also on differential equations whose solutions are functions that satisfy the equation). (see Operator (physics) for other examples)

The most basic operators are linear maps, which act on vector spaces. Linear operators refer to linear maps whose domain and range are the same space, for example from formula_1 to formula_2.
Such operators often preserve properties, such as continuity. For example, differentiation and indefinite integration are linear operators; operators that are built from them are called differential operators, integral operators or integro-differential operators.

Operator is also used for denoting the symbol of a mathematical operation. This is related with the meaning of &quot;operator&quot; in computer programming (see Operator (computer programming)).

== Linear operators ==
The most common kind of operators encountered are &quot;linear operators&quot;. Let and be vector spaces over some field . A &quot;mapping&quot; formula_3 is &quot;linear&quot; if formula_4 for all and in , and for all in .

This means that a linear operator preserves vector space operations, in the sense that it does not matter whether you apply the linear operator before or after the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In more technical words, linear operators are morphisms between vector spaces.
In the finite-dimensional case linear operators can be represented by matrices in the following way. Let be a field, and formula_5 and be finite-dimensional vector spaces over . Let us select a basis formula_6 in and formula_7 in . Then let formula_8 be an arbitrary vector in formula_5 (assuming Einstein convention), and formula_10 be a linear operator. Thenformula_11 Then formula_12, with all formula_13, is the matrix form of the operator formula_14 in the fixed basis formula_15. The tensor formula_16 does not depend on the choice of formula_17, and formula_18 if formula_19. Thus in fixed bases -by- matrices are in bijective correspondence to linear operators from formula_20 to formula_21. 

The important concepts directly related to operators between finite-dimensional vector spaces are the ones of rank, determinant, inverse operator, and eigenspace.

Linear operators also play a great role in the infinite-dimensional case. The concepts of rank and determinant cannot be extended to infinite-dimensional matrices. This is why very different techniques are employed when studying linear operators (and operators in general) in the infinite-dimensional case. The study of linear operators in the infinite-dimensional case is known as functional analysis (so called because various classes of functions form interesting examples of infinite-dimensional vector spaces).

The space of sequences of real numbers, or more generally sequences of vectors in any vector space, themselves form an infinite-dimensional vector space. The most important cases are sequences of real or complex numbers, and these spaces, together with linear subspaces, are known as sequence spaces. Operators on these spaces are known as sequence transformations.

Bounded linear operators over a Banach space form a Banach algebra in respect to the standard operator norm. The theory of Banach algebras develops a very general concept of spectra that elegantly generalizes the theory of eigenspaces.

== Bounded operators==
Let and be two vector spaces over the same ordered field (for example; formula_22), and they are equipped with norms. Then a linear operator from to is called bounded if there exists such that formula_23 for every in .
Bounded operators form a vector space. On this vector space we can introduce a norm that is compatible with the norms of and : formula_24
In case of operators from to itself it can be shown that
: formula_25. 

Any unital normed algebra with this property is called a Banach algebra. It is possible to generalize spectral theory to such algebras. C*-algebras, which are Banach algebras with some additional structure, play an important role in quantum mechanics.

== Examples ==

=== Analysis (calculus) ===

From the point of view of functional analysis, calculus is the study of two linear operators: the differential operator formula_26, and the &quot;Volterra operator&quot; formula_27. 

=== Fundamental analysis operators on scalar and vector fields ===
Three operators are key to vector calculus:
* Grad (gradient), (with operator symbol formula_28) assigns a vector at every point in a scalar field that points in the direction of greatest rate of change of that field and whose norm measures the absolute value of that greatest rate of change.
* Div (divergence), (with operator symbol formula_29) is a vector operator that measures a vector field&#x27;s divergence from or convergence towards a given point.
* Curl, (with operator symbol formula_30) is a vector operator that measures a vector field&#x27;s curling (winding around, rotating around) trend about a given point.

As an extension of vector calculus operators to physics, engineering and tensor spaces, grad, div and curl operators also are often associated with tensor calculus as well as vector calculus.

=== Geometry ===
In geometry, additional structures on vector spaces are sometimes studied. Operators that map such vector spaces to themselves bijectively are very useful in these studies, they naturally form groups by composition.

For example, bijective operators preserving the structure of a vector space are precisely the invertible linear operators. They form the general linear group under composition. However, they &quot;do not&quot; form a vector space under operator addition; since, for example, both the identity and −identity are invertible (bijective), but their sum, 0, is not.

Operators preserving the Euclidean metric on such a space form the isometry group, and those that fix the origin form a subgroup known as the orthogonal group. Operators in the orthogonal group that also preserve the orientation of vector tuples form the special orthogonal group, or the group of rotations.

=== Probability theory ===
Operators are also involved in probability theory, such as expectation, variance, and covariance, which are used to name both number statistics and the operators which produce them. Indeed, every covariance is basically a dot product: Every variance is a dot product of a vector with itself, and thus is a quadratic norm; every standard deviation is a norm (square root of the quadratic norm); the corresponding cosine to this dot product is the Pearson correlation coefficient; expected value is basically an integral operator (used to measure weighted shapes in the space).

==== Fourier series and Fourier transform ====

The Fourier transform is useful in applied mathematics, particularly physics and signal processing. It is another integral operator; it is useful mainly because it converts a function on one (temporal) domain to a function on another (frequency) domain, in a way effectively invertible. No information is lost, as there is an inverse transform operator. In the simple case of periodic functions, this result is based on the theorem that any continuous periodic function can be represented as the sum of a series of sine waves and cosine waves:formula_31 The tuple is in fact an element of an infinite-dimensional vector space , and thus Fourier series is a linear operator.

When dealing with general function formula_32, the transform takes on an integral form:
:formula_33

==== Laplace transform ====

The &quot;Laplace transform&quot; is another integral operator and is involved in simplifying the process of solving differential equations.

Given , it is defined by:formula_34

<doc id="22216" wikidata="Q501874" url="?curid=22216" title="O Brother, Where Art Thou?">
<text>O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a 2000 satirical comedy-drama musical film written, produced, co-edited, and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson, with Charles Durning, Michael Badalucco, John Goodman and Holly Hunter in supporting roles.

The film is set in rural Mississippi in 1937, and it follows three escaped convicts searching for hidden treasure while a sheriff relentlessly pursues them. Its story is a modern satire which, while incorporating social features of the American South, is loosely based on Homer&#x27;s epic Greek poem &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. Some examples of this include Sirens, a Cyclops, and the main character&#x27;s name, &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which is the Roman name for &quot;Odysseus&quot;. The title of the film is a reference to the 1941 Preston Sturges film &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;, in which the protagonist is a director who wants to film &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, a fictitious book about the Great Depression.

Much of the music used in the film is period folk music. The movie was one of the first to extensively use digital color correction to give the film an autumnal sepia-tinted look. It was released by Buena Vista Pictures in North America, while Universal Pictures, through United International Pictures, released it in other countries. The film was met with a positive critical reception, and the soundtrack won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2002. The country and folk musicians who were dubbed into the film include John Hartford, Alison Krauss, Dan Tyminski, Emmylou Harris, Gillian Welch, Ralph Stanley, Chris Sharp, and Patty Loveless. They joined to perform the music from the film on the &quot;Down from the Mountain&quot; concert tour. One of the performances was filmed and released as a documentary.

==Plot==

Three convicts, Pete, Delmar and leader Ulysses Everett McGill, escape from a chain gang to retrieve a buried treasure before the area is flooded to make a lake. The three get a lift from a blind man driving a handcar on a railway. He tells them they will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. The trio make their way to the house of Wash, Pete&#x27;s cousin, who breaks off their shachles and feeds them. They sleep in the barn, but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley, who, along with his men, torches the barn. Wash&#x27;s son helps them escape. The next day, Pete and Delmar get baptized in a river, but Everett refuses to join them.

They pick up Tommy Johnson, a young black man who claims he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play guitar. In need of money, the four stop at a radio station where they record a song as the Soggy Bottom Boys. That night, the trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by the police, and they briefly fall in with outlaw Baby Face Nelson. Unbeknownst to them, the recording becomes a major hit.

Near a river, the group hears singing. They see three women washing clothes and singing. The women give them corn whiskey and they lose consciousness. Upon waking, Delmar finds Pete&#x27;s clothes lying next to him, empty except for a toad. Delmar is convinced the women were Sirens who transformed Pete into the toad. Later, one-eyed Bible salesman Big Dan invites them for a picnic lunch, then mugs them and kills the toad.

On their way to Everett&#x27;s hometown, Everett and Delmar see Pete working on a chain gang. Upon arriving Everett confronts his wife Penny, who has changed her last name and told his daughters he was dead. He gets into a fight with Vernon, her new &quot;suitor&quot;. Later that night, they sneak into Pete&#x27;s holding cell and free him. As it turns out, the women had dragged Pete away and turned him in to the authorities. Under torture, Pete gave away the treasure&#x27;s location to the police. Everett then confesses that there is no treasure. He made it up to persuade the men he was chained with to escape with him in order to stop his wife from getting remarried. Pete is enraged at Everett, because he had two weeks left on his original sentence, and will likely face fifty more years for the escape.

The trio stumble upon a Ku Klux Klan rally, who are planning to lynch Tommy. The trio disguise themselves as Klansmen and move to rescue Tommy. However, Big Dan, a Klan member, reveals their identities. Chaos ensues, and the Grand Wizard reveals himself as Homer Stokes, a candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election. The trio rush Tommy away and cut the supports of a large burning cross, immolating Big Dan.

Everett persuades Pete, Delmar and Tommy to help him win his wife back. They sneak into a Stokes campaign gala dinner she is attending, disguised as hillbilly musicians. The group begins a performance of their radio hit. The crowd recognizes the song and goes wild. Homer recognizes them as the group who humiliated his mob. When he demands the group be arrested and reveals his white supremacist views, the crowd runs him out of town on a rail. Pappy O&#x27;Daniel, the incumbent candidate, seizes the opportunity, endorses the Soggy Bottom Boys and grants them full pardons. Penny agrees to remarry Everett with the condition that he find her original ring.

The next morning, the group sets out to retrieve the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley which Everett had earlier claimed was the location of his treasure. The police, having learned of the place from Pete, arrest the group. Dismissing their claims of having received pardons, Sheriff Cooley orders them hanged. As Everett prays to God, the valley is flooded and they are saved. Tommy finds the ring in a desk that floats by, and they return to town. However, when Everett presents the ring to Penny, it turns out it was her aunt&#x27;s ring. She declares that she will not marry him with that ring, but only her wedding ring, which is still lost.

==Cast==
* George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill. He corresponds to Odysseus (Ulysses) in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. His singing voice is dubbed by Dan Tyminski.

==Production==
The idea of &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; arose spontaneously. Work on the script began in December 1997, long before the start of production, and it was at least half-written by May 1998. Despite the fact that Ethan Coen described the &quot;Odyssey&quot; as &quot;one of my favorite storyline schemes&quot;, neither of the brothers had read the epic, and they were only familiar with its content through adaptations and numerous references to the &quot;Odyssey&quot; in popular culture. According to the brothers, Tim Blake Nelson (who has a degree in classics from Brown University) was the only person on the set who had read the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

The title of the film is a reference to the 1941 Preston Sturges film &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;, in which the protagonist (a director) wants to direct a film about the Great Depression called &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; that will be a &quot;commentary on modern conditions, stark realism, and the problems that confront the average man&quot;. Lacking any experience in this area, the director sets out on a journey to experience the human suffering of the average man but is sabotaged by his anxious studio. The film has some similarity in tone to Sturges&#x27;s film, including scenes with prison gangs and a black church choir. The prisoners at the picture show scene is also a direct homage to a nearly identical scene in Sturges&#x27;s film.

Joel Coen revealed in a 2000 interview that he traveled to Phoenix to offer the lead role to Clooney. Clooney agreed to do the role immediately, without reading the script. He stated that he liked even the Coens&#x27; least successful films. Clooney did not immediately understand his character and sent the script to his uncle Jack, who lived in Kentucky, asking him to read the entire script into a tape recorder. Unknown to Clooney, in his recording, Jack, a devout Baptist, omitted all instances of the words &quot;damn&quot; and &quot;hell&quot; from the Coens&#x27; script, which only became known to Clooney after the directors pointed this out to him during shooting.

This was the fourth film of the brothers in which John Turturro has starred. Other actors in &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; who had worked previously with the Coens include John Goodman (three films), Holly Hunter (two), Charles Durning (two) and Michael Badalucco (one).

The Coens used digital color correction to give the film a sepia-tinted look. Joel stated this was because the actual set was &quot;greener than Ireland&quot;. Cinematographer Roger Deakins said, &quot;Ethan and Joel favored a dry, dusty Delta look with golden sunsets. They wanted it to look like an old hand-tinted picture, with the intensity of colors dictated by the scene and natural skin tones that were all shades of the rainbow.&quot; Initially the crew tried to perform the color correction using a physical process, but after several tries with various chemical processes proved unsatisfactory the process was performed digitally.

This was the fifth film collaboration between the Coen Brothers and Deakins, and it was slated to be shot in Mississippi at a time of year when the foliage, grass, trees, and bushes would be a lush green. It was filmed near locations in Canton, Mississippi, and Florence, South Carolina, in the summer of 1999. After shooting tests, including film bipack and bleach bypass techniques, Deakins suggested digital mastering be used. Deakins spent 11 weeks fine-tuning the look, mainly targeting the greens, making them a burnt yellow and desaturating the overall image in the digital files. This made it the first feature film to be entirely color corrected by digital means, narrowly beating Nick Park&#x27;s &quot;Chicken Run&quot;. &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; was the first time a digital intermediate was used on the entirety of a first-run Hollywood film that otherwise had very few visual effects. The work was done in Los Angeles by Cinesite using a Spirit DataCine for scanning at 2K resolution, a Pandora MegaDef to adjust the color, and a Kodak Lightning II recorder to put out to film.

A major theme of the film is the connection between old-time music and political campaigning in the American South. It makes reference to the traditions, institutions, and campaign practices of bossism and political reform that defined Southern politics in the first half of the 20th century.

The Ku Klux Klan, at the time a political force of white populism, is depicted burning crosses and engaging in ceremonial dance. The character Menelaus &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel, the governor of Mississippi and host of the radio show &quot;The Flour Hour&quot;, is similar in name and demeanor to W. Lee &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel, one-time Governor of Texas and later U.S. Senator from that state. O&#x27;Daniel was in the flour business and used a backing band called the Light Crust Doughboys on his radio show. In one campaign, O&#x27;Daniel carried a broom, an oft-used campaign device in the reform era, promising to sweep away patronage and corruption. His theme song had the hook, &quot;Please pass the biscuits, Pappy&quot;, emphasizing his connection with flour.
While the film borrows from historical politics, there are clear differences between the characters in the film and historical political figures. The O&#x27;Daniel of the movie used &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; as his theme song (which was originally recorded by singer and Governor of Louisiana James Houston &quot;Jimmie&quot; Davis), and Homer Stokes, as the challenger to the incumbent O&#x27;Daniel, portrays himself as the &quot;reform candidate&quot;, using a broom as a prop.

==Music==

The music was originally conceived as a major component of the film, not merely as a background or a support. Producer and musician T Bone Burnett worked with the Coens while the script was still in its working phases and the soundtrack was recorded before filming commenced.

Much of the music used in the film is period-specific folk music. The selection also includes religious music such Primitive Baptist and traditional African American gospel, most notably the Fairfield Four, an &quot;a cappella&quot; quartet with a career extending back to 1921. The quartet appears in the soundtrack and as gravediggers towards the film&#x27;s end. Selected songs in the film reflect the possible spectrum of musical styles typical of the old culture of the American South: gospel, delta blues, country, swing, and bluegrass.

The use of dirges and other macabre songs is a theme that often recurs in Appalachian music (&quot;O Death&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Valley&quot;, &quot;Angel Band&quot;, &quot;I Am Weary&quot;) in contrast to bright and cheerful songs (&quot;Keep On the Sunny Side&quot;, &quot;In the Highways&quot;) in other parts of the film.

The voices of the Soggy Bottom Boys were provided by Dan Tyminski (lead vocal on &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;), Nashville songwriter Harley Allen, and the Nashville Bluegrass Band&#x27;s Pat Enright. The three won a CMA Award for Single of the Year and a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals, both for the song &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;. Tim Blake Nelson sang the lead vocal on &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot;. During a cast reunion at the 2020 Nashville Film Festival, George Clooney recalled being called into the recording studio and singing despite his lack of talent. It was assumed that he could sing because he was the nephew of Rosemary Clooney. Despite the relation, he could not.

&quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; has five variations: two are used in the film, one in the music video, and two in the soundtrack album. Two of the variations feature the verses being sung back-to-back, and the other three variations feature additional music between each verse. Though the song received little significant radio airplay, it reached #35 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart in 2002. The version of &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot; heard in the film is performed not by Krauss and Welch (as it is on the CD and concert tour), but by the Kossoy Sisters with Erik Darling accompanying on long-neck five-string banjo, recorded in 1956 for the album &quot;Bowling Green&quot; on Tradition Records.

The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 13, 2000, the United Kingdom on September 15, 2000 and the United States on December 22, 2000. It grossed $71,868,327 worldwide on a $26 million budget.

===Critical reception===
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 78% of reviews critics are positive based on 158 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Though not as good as Coen brothers&#x27; classics such as &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, the delightfully loopy &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is still a lot of fun.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average, gave it a score of 69 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave two and a half out of four stars to the film, saying all the scenes in the film were &quot;wonderful in their different ways, and yet I left the movie uncertain and unsatisfied&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film was selected to be part of the main competition of the 2000 Cannes Film Festival.
==Soggy Bottom Boys==
The Soggy Bottom Boys are the fictional musical group that the main characters form as part of the plot; their songs also serve as accompaniment for the film. It has been suggested that the name is in homage to the Foggy Mountain Boys, a bluegrass band led by Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs. In the film, the actors lip-synched the songs credited to the band, except for Tim Blake Nelson&#x27;s own voice on &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot;.

The band&#x27;s hit single is Dick Burnett&#x27;s &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;, a song that had enjoyed much success prior to the movie&#x27;s release. After the film&#x27;s release, the fictitious band became so popular that the country and folk musicians whose performances are heard on the film got together for a concert tour called Down from the Mountain, which was filmed for TV and DVD. They included Ralph Stanley, John Hartford, Alison Krauss and Union Station, Emmylou Harris, Gillian Welch, Chris Sharp, Stun Seymour, Dan Tyminski and others.

== History ==
=== Overview ===
==== 1870–1899 Foundational era ====

The proposal of a manufacturing and agriculture university in central Ohio was initially met in the 1870s with hostility from the state&#x27;s agricultural interests and competition for resources from Ohio University, which was chartered by the Northwest Ordinance and Miami University. Championed by the Republican governor Rutherford B. Hayes, the Ohio State University was founded in 1870 as a land-grant university under the Morrill Act of 1862 as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College.

The university opened its doors to 24 students on September 17, 1873. In 1878, the first class of six men graduated. The first woman graduated the following year. Also in 1878, the Ohio legislature recognized an expanded scope for the university by changing its name to &quot;the Ohio State University.&quot;

==== 1900–1980 Middle era ====

In 1906, Ohio State segregationist president William Oxley Thompson, along with the university&#x27;s supporters in the state legislature, put forth the Lybarger Bill with the aim of shifting virtually all higher education support to the continued development of Ohio State while funding only the &quot;normal school&quot; functions of the state&#x27;s other public universities. Although the Lybarger Bill failed narrowly to gain passage, in its place the Eagleson Bill was passed as a compromise, which determined that all doctoral education and research functions would be the role of Ohio State, and that Miami University and Ohio University would not offer instruction beyond the master&#x27;s degree level – an agreement that would remain in place until the 1950s. In 1916, Ohio State was elected into membership in the Association of American Universities.

In 1911, president Thompson wrote in a letter, &quot;the race problem is growing in intensity every year, and I am disposed to doubt the wisdom on the part of the colored people of taking any move that practically forces the doctrine of social equality.&quot; At the same time, Ohio State &quot;practiced racial segregation&quot; that was widespread across the country at the time against Black students, and &quot;there is no known evidence [Thompson] saw benefits in addressing it&quot;. In 2024, after attempts were made to remove Thompson&#x27;s statue from the Oval, university spokesperson Ben Johnson stated &quot;the naming review process is thoughtful and thorough and therefore could take several years&quot;, but the statue has not been removed.

With the onset of the Great Depression, Ohio State would face many of the challenges affecting universities throughout America as budget support was slashed, and students without the means of paying tuition returned home to support families. By the mid-1930s, however, enrollment had stabilized due in large part to the role of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and later the National Youth Administration. By the end of the decade, enrollment had still managed to grow to over 17,500. In 1934, the Ohio State Research Foundation was founded to bring in outside funding for faculty research projects. In 1938, a development office was opened to begin raising funds privately to offset reductions in state support.

In 1952, Ohio State founded the interdisciplinary Mershon Center for International Security Studies, which it still houses. The work of this program led to the United States Department of Homeland Security basing the National Academic Consortium for Homeland Security at the university in 2003.

==== 1980–present Modern era ====

Ohio State had an open admissions policy until the late 1980s. Since the early 2000s, the college has raised standards for admission, and been increasingly cited as one of the best public universities in the United States. The main campus in Columbus has grown into the fifth-largest university campus in the United States.

On January 12, 2015, OSU claimed the first-ever College Football Playoff National Championship by defeating Oregon 42–20.

On June 22, 2022, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted the university a trademark on the word &quot;the&quot; in relation to clothing, such as T-shirts, baseball caps and hats distributed and/or sold through athletic or collegiate channels. Ohio State and its fans, in particular those of its athletics program, frequently emphasize the word &quot;THE&quot; when referring to the school.

Michael V. Drake became the 15th president of Ohio State in 2014. In 2020, Kristina M. Johnson took office as the 16th president. And in 2023, Walter E. Carter Jr. took office as the 17th president.

=== Significant events ===

==== 1969–1970 Vietnam War protests ====
Throughout 1969, anti-Vietnam War protest tensions grew on Ohio State&#x27;s campus. What is now Bricker Hall was occupied by students, but after being told they had &quot;five minutes to leave, or they&#x27;d be arrested&quot;, students departed from the building. In late April 1970, anti-war riots ensued on Ohio State campus, leading to nearly 300 arrests, over 60 injuries, and seven gunshot wounds. Students began &quot;boycotting classes with a student strike, protesting the university&#x27;s rejection of a list of demands presented the week before. Specific demands included adding black and women&#x27;s studies to the university&#x27;s courses.&quot; On April 29, 1970, five days before the Kent State shootings, students picketed buildings, but this initially peaceful protest &quot;started to spiral out of control&quot; after Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers arrived in riot gear. When a man was assaulted by three students, tear gas was deployed, in response to which protesters threw rocks at the National Guard. Seven students were struck with a shotgun blast near the Student Union. There were no casualties, and the shooter was not identified.

==== 1978–1998 Richard Strauss sexual abuse scandal ====
==== 2016 terrorist attack ====
==== 2024 pro-Palestinian campus protests ====
== Campus ==

Ohio State&#x27;s main campus is about north of Columbus&#x27; downtown. The historical center of campus is the Oval, a quad of about . The original campus was laid out in the English country style with University Hall overlooking what would become the Oval. From 1905 to 1913, the Olmsted brothers, who had designed New York City&#x27;s Central Park, were contracted as architectural consultants. Under their leadership, a more formal landscape plan was created with its center axis through the Oval. This axis shifted the university&#x27;s street grid 12.25 degrees from the City of Columbus&#x27; street grid. Construction of the main library in 1915 reinforced this grid shift.
Ohio State&#x27;s research library system has a combined collection of over 5.8 million volumes. Along with 21 libraries on its Columbus campus, the university has eight branches at off-campus research facilities and regional campuses, and a book storage depository near campus. In all, the Ohio State library system encompasses 55 branches and specialty collections. Some more significant collections include the Byrd Polar Research Center Archival Program, which has the archives of Admiral Richard E. Byrd and other polar research materials; the Hilandar Research Library, which has the world&#x27;s largest collection of medieval Slavic manuscripts on microform; the Ohio State Cartoon Library &amp; Museum, the world&#x27;s largest repository of original cartoons; the Lawrence and Lee Theatre Research Institute; and the archives of Senator John Glenn.

Anchoring the traditional campus gateway at the eastern end of the Oval is the 1989 Wexner Center for the Arts. Designed by architects Peter Eisenman of New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, the center was funded in large part by Ohio State alumnus Les Wexner&#x27;s gift of $25 million in the 1980s. The center was founded to encompass all aspects of visual and performing arts with a focus on new commissions and artist residencies. Part of its design was to pay tribute to the armory that formerly had the same location. Its groundbreaking deconstructivist architecture has resulted in it being lauded as one of the most important buildings of its generation. Its design has also been criticized as proving less than ideal for many of the art installations it has attempted to display. The centerpiece of the Wexner Center&#x27;s permanent collection is Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Nude on a Black Armchair&quot;, which was purchased by Wexner at auction for $45 million.

To the south of the Oval is another, somewhat smaller expanse of green space commonly referred to as the South Oval. At its eastern end, it is anchored by the Ohio Union. To the west are Hale Hall, the Kuhn Honors House, Browning Amphitheatre (a traditional stone Greek theatre) and Mirror Lake.

Knowlton Hall, dedicated in October 2004, is at the corner of West Woodruff Avenue and Tuttle Park Place, next to Ohio Stadium. Knowlton Hall along with the Fisher College of Business and Hitchcock Hall form an academic nucleus in the northwestern corner of North campus. Knowlton Hall was designed by Atlanta-based Mack Scogin Merrill Elam along with WSA Studio from Columbus. The Hall is home to the KSA Café, the disciplines of architecture, landscape architecture, city and regional planning, and about 550 undergraduate and graduate students. Knowlton Hall stands out from the general reddish-brown brick of Ohio State&#x27;s campus with distinctive white marble tiles that cover the building&#x27;s exterior. This unique wall cladding was requested by Austin E. Knowlton, the namesake of and main patron to the creation of Knowlton Hall. Knowlton also requested that five white marble columns be erected on the site, each column representing one of the classical orders of architecture.

The Ohio State College of Medicine is on the southern edge of the central campus. It is home to the James Cancer Hospital, a cancer research institute and one of the National Cancer Institute&#x27;s 41 comprehensive cancer centers, along with the Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital, a research institute for cardiovascular disease.

The campus is served by the Campus Area Bus Service.

===Regional campuses===
The university also operates regional campuses in five areas:

* Ohio State University at Lima – Lima, Ohio, established in 1960
* Ohio State University at Mansfield – Mansfield, Ohio, established in 1958
* Ohio State University at Marion – Marion, Ohio, established in 1957
* Ohio State University at Newark – Newark, Ohio, established in 1957
* Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI) – Wooster, Ohio, established in 1969

==Academics==

===Undergraduate admissions===
Ohio State is considered a selective public university. Undergraduate admissions selectivity to Ohio State is rated as 91/99 by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; (meaning &quot;highly selective&quot;) and &quot;more selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;; according to the data, it is the most selective for any public university in the state of Ohio. &quot;The New York Times&quot; classifies Ohio State as a &quot;highly selective public college&quot;.

For the Class of 2025 (enrolled fall 2021), Ohio State received 58,180 applications and accepted 33,269 (57.2%). Of those accepted, 8,423 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 25.3%. OSU&#x27;s freshman retention rate is 93.9%, with 88% going on to graduate within six years.

Of the 21% of the incoming freshman class who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1260–1420. Of the 64% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores, the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 26 and 32. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 26 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.


===Rankings and recognition===


&quot;The Public Ivies: America&#x27;s Flagship Public Universities&quot; (2000) by Howard and Matthew Greene listed Ohio State as one of a select number of public universities offering the highest educational quality. In its 2023 edition, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Ohio State as tied for 43rd among all national universities. They ranked the college&#x27;s political science, audiology, sociology, speech–language pathology, finance, accounting, public affairs, nursing, social work, healthcare administration and pharmacy programs as among the top 20 programs in the country. The &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; placed Ohio State 39-51 nationally and 101–150 globally for 2023. In its 2024 rankings, &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; ranked it tied for 99th in the world. In 2024, &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; ranked the university 151st in the world. The &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; college rankings, which seek to evaluate colleges&#x27; contributions to American society based on factors of social mobility, research and service to the country by their graduates, placed Ohio State 61st among national universities in 2023.
In 1916, Ohio State became the first university in Ohio to be extended membership into the Association of American Universities, and remains the only public university in Ohio among the organization&#x27;s 60 members. Ohio State is also the only public university in Ohio to be classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Highest Research Activity&quot; and have its undergraduate admissions classified as &quot;more selective&quot;.

Ohio State&#x27;s political science program is ranked among the top programs globally. Considered to be one of the leading departments in the United States, it has played a particularly significant role in the construction and development of the constructivist and realist schools of international relations. In 2004, it was ranked as first among public institutions and fourth overall in the world by British political scientist Simon Hix at the London School of Economics and Political Science, while a 2007 study in the academic journal &quot;PS: Political Science &amp; Politics&quot; ranked it ninth in the United States. It is a leading producer of Fulbright Scholars.

&quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; ranked the undergraduate business program at Ohio State&#x27;s Fisher College of Business as the 14th best in the nation in its 2016 rankings.

The Ohio State linguistics department was recently ranked among the top 10 programs nationally, and top 20 internationally by &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;.

The college is the only school in North America that offers an ABET-accredited welding engineering undergraduate degree.

===Research===


The National Science Foundation ranked Ohio State University 12th among American universities for research and development expenditures in 2021 with $1.23 billion.

In a 2007 report released by the National Science Foundation, Ohio State&#x27;s research expenditures for 2006 were $652 million, placing it seventh among public universities and 11th overall, also ranking third among all American universities for private industry-sponsored research. Research expenditures at Ohio State were $864 million in 2017. In 2006, Ohio State announced it would designate at least $110 million of its research efforts toward what it termed &quot;fundamental concerns&quot; such as research toward a cure for cancer, renewable energy sources and sustainable drinking water supplies. In 2021, President Kristina M. Johnson announced the university would invest at least $750 million over the next 10 years toward research and researchers. This was announced in conjunction with Ohio State&#x27;s new Innovation District, which will be an interdisciplinary research facility and act as a hub for healthcare and technology research, serving Ohio State faculty and students as well as public and private partners. Construction of the facility was completed in 2023, as one of the first buildings in the District.

Research facilities include Aeronautical/Astronautical Research Laboratory, Byrd Polar Research Center, Center for Automotive Research, (OSU CAR), Chadwick Arboretum, Biomedical Research Tower, Biological Sciences Building, CDME, Comprehensive Cancer Center, David Heart and Lung Research Institute, Electroscience Laboratory, Large Binocular Telescope (&quot;LBT&quot;, originally named the Columbus Project), Mershon Center for International Security Studies, Museum of Biological Diversity, National Center for the Middle Market, Stone Laboratory on Gibraltar Island, Center for Urban and Regional Analysis and Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center.

===Endowment and fundraising===
Ohio State was among the first group of four public universities to raise a $1 billion endowment when it passed the $1 billion mark in 1999. At the end of 2005, Ohio State&#x27;s endowment stood at $1.73 billion, ranking it seventh among public universities and 27th among all American universities. In June 2006, the endowment passed the $2 billion mark.

In recent decades, and in response to continually shrinking state funding, Ohio State has conducted two significant multi-year fundraising campaigns. The first concluded in 1987 and raised $460 million, a record at the time for a public university. The &quot;Affirm Thy Friendship Campaign&quot; took place between 1995 and 2000. With an initial goal of raising $850 million, the campaign&#x27;s final tally was $1.23 billion, placing Ohio State among the small group of public universities to have successfully conducted a $1 billion campaign. At his welcoming ceremony, returning President E. Gordon Gee announced in the fall of 2007 that Ohio State would launch a $2.5 billion fundraising campaign. In 2019, celebrating the university&#x27;s 150th year, President Michael V. Drake announced the &quot;Time and Change Campaign&quot; with a goal of raising $4.5 billion from 1 million individual donors.

==Student life==

The Office of Student Life has partnership affiliations with the Schottenstein Center, the Blackwell Inn and the Drake Events Center. Services supporting student wellness include the Wilce Student Health Center, named for university physician John Wilce, the Mary A. Daniels Student Wellness Center and the Counseling and Consultation Service.

The RPAC is the main recreational facility on campus. The Wellness Center within the RPAC offers services such as nutrition counseling, financial coaching, HIV and STI testing, sexual assault services, and alcohol and other drug education.

Ohio State&#x27;s &quot;Buckeye Bullet&quot; electric car broke the world record for the fastest speed by an electric vehicle on October 3, 2004, with a maximum speed of at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The vehicle also holds the U.S. record for fastest electric vehicle with a speed of , and peak timed mile speed of . A team of engineering students from the university&#x27;s &quot;Center for Automotive Research-Intelligent Transportation&quot; (CAR-IT) designed, built and managed the vehicle. In 2007, Buckeye Bullet 2 was launched. This follow-up effort was a collaboration between Ohio State engineering students and engineers from the Ford Motor Company and will seek to break the land speed record for hydrogen cell powered vehicles.

===Diversity===
=== Sexual harassment handling ===

In June 2018, Ohio State dissolved its Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit and eliminated four positions in the unit due to concerns about mismanagement and a lack of support for survivors of sexual assault. This occurred after the unit was suspended in February 2018 and following an external review. &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; and the school newspaper, &quot;The Lantern&quot;, reported that &quot;[SCE] failed to properly report students&#x27; sexual-assault complaints&quot; and that some victims were told that they were lying&#x27;, &#x27;delusional&#x27;, &#x27;suffering from mental illness&#x27;, &#x27;have an active imagination&#x27;, that they &#x27;didn&#x27;t understand their own experience&#x27;, and also &#x27;fabricated their story. With help from the Philadelphia law firm Cozen O&#x27;Connor, the university will be creating a new framework to handle sexual assault cases and reevaluating its Title IX program.

On July 20, 2018, &quot;BBC News&quot; reported that over 100 male students, including athletes from 14 sports, had reported sexual misconduct by a deceased university team physician, Richard Strauss. The reports dated back to 1978, and included claims that he groped and took nude photographs of his patients. Four former wrestlers filed a lawsuit against Ohio State for ignoring complaints of &quot;rampant sexual misconduct&quot; by Strauss. U.S. representative Jim Jordan was named in the lawsuit and has since denied the former wrestlers&#x27; claims that he knew about the abuse while he was an assistant coach for eight years at the university. In May 2020, the university entered into a settlement and agreed to pay $40.9 million to the sexual abuse survivors.

===Activities and organizations===
The Ohio Union was the first student union built by an American public university. It is dedicated to the enrichment of the student experience, on and off the university campus. The first Ohio Union, on the south edge of the South Oval, was constructed in 1909 and was later renamed Enarson Hall. The second Ohio Union was completed in 1950 and was prominently along High Street, southeast of the Oval. It was a center of student life for more than 50 years, providing facilities for student activities, organizations and events, and serving as an important meeting place for campus and community interaction. The union also housed many student services and programs, along with dining and recreational facilities. The second Ohio Union was demolished in February 2007 to make way for the new Ohio Union, which was finished in 2010. During this time, student activities were relocated to Ohio Stadium and other academic buildings.

The university has over 1,000 student organizations; intercollegiate, club and recreational sports programs; student media organizations and publications, fraternities and sororities; and three student governments.

====Student organizations====
Student organizations at Ohio State provide students with opportunities to get involved in a wide variety of interest areas including academic, social, religious, artistic, service-based, diversity and many more.
There are over 1,000 registered student organizations that involve many thousands of students. The university&#x27;s forensics team has won the state National Forensics Association tournament several times.

Block &quot;O&quot; is currently the largest student-run organization on the campus of Ohio State. With over 2,400 annual members, Block &quot;O&quot; serves as the official student cheering section at athletic events for the university. According to the Student Organization Office in the Ohio Union, Agricultural Education Society is the oldest student organization on campus. The Men&#x27;s Glee Club often disputes the claim, but after consultation with Ohio Union Staff, Agricultural Education Society was named as the university&#x27;s oldest organization.

Each year, students may sign up to participate in BuckeyeThon, Ohio State&#x27;s student-led philanthropy. The organization hosts events throughout the year to support the hematology/oncology/bone marrow transplant unit at Nationwide Children&#x27;s Hospital in Columbus. Each February, thousands of students and community members attend BuckeyeThon&#x27;s signature event, a Dance Marathon consisting of two separate 12-hour shifts. In the past 15 years, students have raised over $5 million to support treatment, research, and various therapies at the hospital. Unique to BuckeyeThon is the use of an operational fund separate from the main philanthropic cancer fund. As a registered non-profit, BuckeyeThon is subject to university audit and issues gift receipts through the Foundation.

Ohio State has several student-managed publications and media outlets. &quot;The Makio&quot; is the official yearbook. &quot;The Makio&#x27;s&quot; sales plummeted by 60% during the early 1970s; the organization went bankrupt and stopped publication during the late 1970s. The book was revived from 1985 to 1994 and again in 2000, thanks to several student organizations. &quot;The Lantern&quot; is the school&#x27;s daily newspaper and has operated as a laboratory newspaper in the School of Communication (formerly the School of Journalism) since 1881. &quot;Mosaic&quot; is a literary magazine published by Ohio State, which features undergraduate fiction, poetry and art. &quot;The Sundial&quot; is a student-written and -published humor magazine. Founded in 1911, it is one of the oldest humor magazines in the country, but has not been published without large interruptions. Ohio State has two improvisational comedy groups that regularly perform around campus and across the U.S. There are two student-run radio stations: AROUSE, the music station, is home to over 100 student DJs, streaming music and independent content, and Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio. Students also operate a local cable TV channel known as Buckeye TV, which airs primarily on the campus closed cable system operated by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).

====Student government====
At the Ohio State University, three recognized student governments represent their constituents.

# Undergraduate Student Government (USG), which consists of elected and appointed student representatives who serve as liaisons from the undergraduate student body to university officials. USG seeks to outreach to and work for the students at Ohio State.
# Council of Graduate Students (CGS), which promotes and provides academic, administrative and social programs for the university community in general and for graduate students in particular. The council provides a forum in which the graduate student body may present, discuss and set upon issues related to its role in the academic and non-academic aspects of the university community.
# Inter-Professional Council (IPC), which is a representative body of all professional students in the colleges of dentistry, law, medicine, optometry, pharmacy and veterinary medicine. Its purpose is to act as a liaison between these students and the governing bodies of the university.

===Residential life===

Ohio State operates 41 on-campus residence halls divided into three geographic clusters: South Campus (site of the university&#x27;s original dormitories), North Campus (largely constructed during the post-war enrollment boom) and West Campus (&quot;The Towers&quot;). The residence hall system has 40 smaller living and learning environments defined by social or academic considerations.

Separate housing for graduate and professional students is maintained on the Southern tier of campus within the Gateway Residential Complex and the William H. Hall Student Residential Complex. Family housing is maintained at Buckeye Village at the far northern edge of campus beyond the athletic complex.

Student Life University Housing also administers student residential housing on the OSU Newark, OSU Mansfield and OSU Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI) campuses.

The Residence Hall Advisory Council (RHAC), which is a representative body of all students living in the university&#x27;s residence halls, helps evaluate and improve the living conditions of the residence halls.

==Athletics==


Ohio State&#x27;s intercollegiate sports teams are called the &quot;Buckeyes&quot; (derived from the colloquial term for people from the state of Ohio and after the state tree, the Ohio Buckeye, &quot;Aesculus glabra&quot;), and participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I in all sports (Division I FBS in football) and the Big Ten Conference in most sports. (The women&#x27;s hockey program competes in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association.) The school colors are scarlet and gray. Brutus Buckeye is the mascot. Ohio State currently has 36 varsity teams. As of 2017, the football program is valued at $1.5 billion, the highest valuation of any such program in the country. The team&#x27;s rivalry against the University of Michigan has been termed as one of the greatest in North American sports.

Ohio State is one of six universities – the University of Michigan, the University of Florida, Stanford University, UCLA and the University of California at Berkeley being the others – to have won national championships in all three major men&#x27;s sports (baseball, basketball and football). Ohio State is also one of only two universities to appear in the national championship games in both football and men&#x27;s basketball in the same calendar year (the other being the University of Florida). Ohio State has also won national championships in wrestling, men&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s swimming and diving, men&#x27;s outdoor track and field, men&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s gymnastics, men&#x27;s fencing, women&#x27;s rowing, co-ed fencing and multiple synchronized swimming championships. The Ohio State equestrian team has won eight Intercollegiate Horse Show Association national championships. Since the inception of the Athletic Director&#x27;s Cup, Ohio State has finished in the top 25 each year, including top-six finishes in three of the last five years. During the 2005–2006 school year, Ohio State became the first Big Ten team to win conference championships in football, men&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s basketball. Ohio State repeated the feat during the 2006–2007 school year, winning solo championships in all three sports. In 2007, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; nicknamed Ohio State&#x27;s athletic program as being &quot;The Program&quot; due to the unsurpassed facilities, an unparalleled number of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports teams and their success, and the financial support of an impressive fan base.

==Traditions==
The Ohio State University Marching Band is famous for &quot;Script Ohio&quot;, during which the band marches single-file through the curves of the word &quot;Ohio&quot;, much like a pen writes the word, all while playing the French march &quot;Le Regiment de Sambre et Meuse&quot;.

&quot;Across the Field&quot;, a fight song used by teams of all sports, has been played at events since 1915. &quot;Buckeye Battle Cry&quot;, the second fight song which was first performed in 1928, is played as the marching band enters via the Ohio Stadium ramp.

===Affiliated media===
Ohio State operates a public television station, WOSU-TV (virtual channel 34/DT 16, a local PBS TV station), as well as two public radio stations, WOSU-FM 89.7(NPR/BBC news/talk) and WOSA-FM 101.1 (classical, &quot;Classical 101&quot;) in Columbus.

Ohio State alumni have appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine 12 times, with the artwork of alumnus Roy Lichtenstein featured on an additional two &quot;Time&quot; covers. George Steinbrenner, former owner of the New York Yankees who won seven World Series with the team, earned his master&#x27;s degree from Ohio State. Larry Sanger, one of the founders of Wikipedia, and Steve May, chief technology officer at Pixar, both graduated from Ohio State. Roboticist James S. Albus was named a &quot;Hero of US Manufacturing&quot; by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in 1997. Howard Tucker, who as of April 2023 was the world&#x27;s oldest living practicing doctor at 100, attended for both his undergraduate work and medical school.

Ohio State alumni have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, the NFL Hall of Fame and the Basketball Hall of Fame. Its athletes have won a combined 83 Olympic medals and three times have received the Sullivan Award as the nation&#x27;s top amateur athlete.

=== Faculty ===
As of 2008, Ohio State&#x27;s faculty included 21 members of the National Academy of Sciences or National Academy of Engineering, four members of the Institute of Medicine and 177 elected fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2009, 17 Ohio State faculty members were elected as AAAS Fellows. Each year since 2002, Ohio State has either led or been second among all American universities in the number of their faculty members elected as fellows to the AAAS.

In surveys conducted in 2005 and 2006 by the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE), Ohio State was rated as &quot;exemplary&quot; in four of the seven measured aspects of workplace satisfaction for junior faculty members at 31 universities: overall tenure practices, policy effectiveness, compensation and work-family balance.

<text>Ontario is the southernmost province of Canada. Located in Central Canada, Ontario is the country&#x27;s most populous province. As of the 2021 Canadian census, it is home to 38.5 per cent of the country&#x27;s population, and is the second-largest province by total area (after Quebec). Ontario is Canada&#x27;s fourth-largest jurisdiction in total area of all the Canadian provinces and territories. It is home to the nation&#x27;s capital, Ottawa, and its most populous city, Toronto, which is Ontario&#x27;s provincial capital.

Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west, Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north, and Quebec to the east and northeast. To the south, it is bordered by the U.S. states of (from west to east) Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Almost all of Ontario&#x27;s border with the United States follows rivers and lakes: from the westerly Lake of the Woods, eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence River drainage system. There is only about of actual land border, made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border.

The great majority of Ontario&#x27;s population and arable land is in Southern Ontario, and while agriculture remains a significant industry, the region&#x27;s economy depends highly on manufacturing. In contrast, Northern Ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and heavy forestation, with mining and forestry making up the region&#x27;s major industries.

== Etymology ==
Ontario is a term thought to be derived from Indigenous origins, either , a Huron (Wyandot) word meaning &quot;great lake&quot;, or possibly , which means &quot;beautiful water&quot; or &quot;sparkling water&quot; in the Iroquoian languages. Ontario has about 250,000 freshwater lakes. The first mention of the name Ontario was in 1641, when &quot;Ontario&quot; was used to describe the land on the north shore of the easternmost part of the Great Lakes. It was adopted as the official name of the new province at Confederation in 1867.

== Geography ==

The thinly populated Canadian Shield, which dominates the northwestern and central portions of the province, comprises over half the land area of Ontario. Although this area mostly does not support agriculture, it is rich in minerals, partly covered by the Central and Midwestern Canadian Shield forests, and studded with lakes and rivers. Northern Ontario is subdivided into two sub-regions: Northwestern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario.

The virtually unpopulated Hudson Bay Lowlands in the extreme north and northeast are mainly swampy and sparsely forested.

Southern Ontario is further sub-divided into four sub-regions: Central Ontario (although not actually the province&#x27;s geographic centre), Eastern Ontario, Golden Horseshoe and Southwestern Ontario (parts of which were formerly referred to as Western Ontario).

Despite the rarity of mountainous terrain in the province, there are large areas of uplands, particularly within the Canadian Shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the Niagara Escarpment which crosses the south. The highest point is Ishpatina Ridge at above sea level in Temagami, Northeastern Ontario. In the south, elevations of over are surpassed near Collingwood, above the Blue Mountains in the Dundalk Highlands and in hilltops near the Madawaska River in Renfrew County.

The Carolinian forest zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province. The temperate and fertile Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Valley in the south is part of the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests ecoregion where the forest has now been largely replaced by agriculture, industrial and urban development. A well-known geographic feature is Niagara Falls, part of the Niagara Escarpment. The Saint Lawrence Seaway allows navigation to and from the Atlantic Ocean as far inland as Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario. Northern Ontario covers approximately 87% of the province&#x27;s surface area; conversely, Southern Ontario contains 94% of the population.

Point Pelee is a peninsula of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario (near Windsor and Detroit, Michigan) that is the southernmost extent of Canada&#x27;s mainland. Pelee Island and Middle Island in Lake Erie extend slightly farther. All are south of 42°N – slightly farther south than the northern border of California.

=== Climate ===
Ontario&#x27;s climate varies by season and location. Three air sources affect it: cold, dry, arctic air from the north (dominant factor during the winter months, and for a longer part of the year in far northern Ontario); Pacific polar air crossing in from the western Canadian Prairies/US Northern Plains; and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. The effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude, proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent, terrain relief. In general, most of Ontario&#x27;s climate is classified as humid continental.

Ontario has three main climatic regions:
* The surrounding Great Lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern Ontario. During the fall and winter, the release of heat stored by the lakes moderates the climate near the shores which give parts of southern Ontario milder winters than mid-continental areas at lower latitudes. Parts of Southwestern Ontario and the Niagara region (generally south of a line from Sarnia–Toronto) have a moderate humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;), similar to the inland Mid-Atlantic states and the Great Lakes portion of the Midwestern United States. The region has warm to hot, humid summers and cold winters. Annual precipitation ranges from and is well distributed throughout the year. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes, making for abundant snow in some areas. In December 2010, the snowbelt set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within 48 hours.
* The next climatic region is Central and Eastern Ontario, which has a moderate humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). This region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder, longer winters, ample snowfall (even in regions not directly in the snowbelts) and annual precipitation similar to the rest of Southern Ontario.

In the northeastern parts of Ontario, extending south as far as Kirkland Lake, the cold waters of Hudson Bay depress summer temperatures, making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes. The same is true on the northern shore of Lake Superior, which cools hot, humid air from the south, leading to cooler summer temperatures. Along the eastern shores of Lake Superior and Lake Huron winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy lake-effect snow squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals to upwards of in some places. These regions have higher annual precipitation, in some places over .

* The northernmost parts of Ontario – primarily north of 50°N – have a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with long, severely cold winters and short, cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons. With no major mountain ranges blocking sinking Arctic air masses, temperatures of are not uncommon; snow remains on the ground for sometimes over half the year. Snow accumulation can be high in some areas. Precipitation is generally less than and peaks in the summer months in the form of rain or thunderstorms.

Severe thunderstorms peak in summer. Windsor, in Southern (Southwestern) Ontario, has the most lightning strikes per year in Canada, averaging 33 days of thunderstorm activity per year. In a typical year, Ontario averages 11 confirmed tornado touchdowns. Ontario had a record 29 tornadoes in both 2006 and 2009. Tropical depression remnants occasionally bring heavy rains and winds in the south, but are rarely deadly. A notable exception was Hurricane Hazel which struck Southern Ontario centred on Toronto, in October 1954.

== History ==

===Indigenous habitation (pre–1610)===

Paleo-Indians were the first people to settle on the lands of Ontario, about 11,000 years ago, after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia to North America between 25,000 and 50,000 years ago. During the Archaic period, which lasted from 8000 to 1000 BC, the population slowly increased, with a generally egalitarian hunter-gatherer society and a warmer climate. Trading routes also began emerging along the St. Lawrence River and around the Great Lakes. Hunting and gathering remained predominant throughout the early Woodland period, and social structures and trade continued to develop. Around 500 AD, corn cultivation began, later expanding to include beans and squash around 1100 AD. Increased agriculture enabled more permanent, fortified, and significantly larger settlements. In southern Ontario during the 1400s, the population of some villages numbered in the thousands, with longhouses that could house over a hundred people. Around this time, large-scale warfare began in southern Ontario, leading to the emergence of Iroquoian groups, including the Neutral Confederacy, Erie and Wendat (Huron). Groups in northern Ontario were primarily Algonquian and included the Ojibwe, who traded with the Iroquois.

Many ethnocultural groups emerged and came to exist on the lands of Ontario: the Algonquins, Mississaugas, Ojibway, Cree, Odawa, Pottowatomi, and Iroquois.

===Pays d&#x27;en Haut (1610–1763)===

In the 15th century, the Byzantine Empire fell, prompting Western Europeans to search for new sea routes to the Far East. Around 1522–1523, Giovanni da Verrazzano persuaded King Francis I of France to commission an expedition to find a western route to Cathay (China) via a Northwest Passage. Though this expedition was unsuccessful, it established the name &quot;New France&quot; for northeastern North America. After a few expeditions, France mostly abandoned North America for 50 years because of its financial crisis; France was involved in the Italian Wars and there were religious wars between Protestants and Catholics. Around 1580 however, the rise of the fur trade (particularly the demand for beaver pelts), reignited French interest.

In 1608, Samuel de Champlain established France&#x27;s first colonial settlement in New France, the Habitation de Québec (now Quebec City), in the colony of Canada (now southern Quebec). Afterwards, French explorers continued to travel west, establishing new villages along the coasts of the Saint Lawrence River. French explorers, the first of which was Étienne Brûlé who explored the Georgian Bay area in 1610–1612, mapped Southern Ontario and called the region the Pays d&#x27;en Haut (&quot;Upper Country&quot;), in reference to the region being upstream of the Saint Lawrence River. The colony of the Pays d&#x27;en Haut was formally established in 1610 as an administrative dependency of Canada, and was for defence and business rather than a settlement colony. The territory of the Pays-d&#x27;en-Haut was quite large and would today include the province of Ontario, as well as, in whole or in part, the American states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. Indigenous peoples were the vast majority of the Pays d&#x27;en Haut population. As for Northern Ontario, the English explorer Henry Hudson sailed into Hudson Bay in 1611 and claimed its drainage basin for England. The area would become known as Rupert&#x27;s Land.

Samuel de Champlain reached Lake Huron in 1615, and French missionaries, such as the Jésuites and Supliciens, began to establish posts along the Great Lakes. The French allied with most Indigenous groups of Ontario, all for the fur trade and for defence against Iroquois attacks (which would later be called the Iroquois Wars). The French would declare their Indigenous allies to be subjects of the King of France and would often act as mediators between different groups. The Iroquois later allied themselves with the British.

From 1634 to 1640, the Huron were devastated by European infectious diseases, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no immunity. By 1700, the Iroquois had been driven out or left the area that would become Ontario and the Mississaugas of the Ojibwa had settled the north shore of Lake Ontario. The remaining Huron settled north of Quebec.

During the French and Indian War, the North American theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War of 1754 to 1763, the British defeated the armies of New France and its Indigenous allies. In the Treaty of Paris 1763 France ceded most of its possessions in North America to Britain. Using the Quebec Act, Britain re-organised the territory into the Province of Quebec.

===Province of Quebec (1763–1791)===
In 1782–1784, 5,000 United Empire Loyalists entered what is now Ontario following the American Revolution. The Kingdom of Great Britain granted them land and other items with which to rebuild their lives. The British also set up reserves in Ontario for the Mohawks who had fought for the British and had lost their land in New York state. Other Iroquois, also displaced from New York were resettled in 1784 at the Six Nations reserve at the west end of Lake Ontario. The Mississaugas, displaced by European settlements, would later move to Six Nations also.

After the American War of Independence, the first reserves for First Nations were established. These are situated at Six Nations (1784), Tyendinaga (1793) and Akwesasne (1795). Six Nations and Tyendinaga were established by the British for those Indigenous groups who had fought on the side of the British, and were expelled from the new United States. Akwesasne was a pre-existing Mohawk community and its borders were formalized under the 1795 Jay Treaty.

In 1788, while part of the province of Quebec, southern Ontario was divided into four districts: Hesse, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, and Nassau. In 1792, the four districts were renamed: Hesse became the Western District, Lunenburg became the Eastern District, Mecklenburg became the Midland District, and Nassau became the Home District. Counties were created within the districts.

The population of Canada west of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence substantially increased during this period, a fact recognized by the &quot;Constitutional Act&quot; of 1791, which split Quebec into the Canadas: Upper Canada southwest of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence, and Lower Canada east of it.

===Upper Canada (1791–1841)===
John Graves Simcoe was appointed Upper Canada&#x27;s first Lieutenant governor in 1793. A second wave of Americans, not all of them necessarily loyalists moved to Upper Canada after 1790 until the pre-war of 1812, many seeking available cheap land, and at the time, lower taxation.

By 1798, there were eight districts: Eastern, Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, and Western. By 1826, there were eleven districts: Bathurst, Eastern, Gore, Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, and Western. By 1838, there were twenty districts: Bathurst, Brock, Colbourne, Dalhousie, Eastern, Gore, Home, Huron, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, Prince Edward, Simcoe, Talbot, Victoria, Wellington, and Western.

American troops in the War of 1812 invaded Upper Canada across the Niagara River and the Detroit River, but were defeated and pushed back by the British, Canadian fencibles and militias, and First Nations warriors. However, the Americans eventually gained control of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The 1813 Battle of York saw American troops defeat the garrison at the Upper Canada capital of York. The Americans looted the town and burned the Upper Canada Parliament Buildings during their brief occupation. The British would burn the American capital of Washington, D.C. in 1814.

After the War of 1812, relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from Europe rather than from the United States. As was the case in the previous decades, this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders. Despite affordable and often free land, many arriving newcomers, mostly from Britain and Ireland, found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. However, population growth far exceeded emigration in the following decades. It was a mostly agrarian-based society, but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving previously damaged relations over time.

Meanwhile, Ontario&#x27;s numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development. As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation&#x27;s leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts and communications.

Unrest in the colony began to chafe against the aristocratic Family Compact who governed while benefiting economically from the region&#x27;s resources, and who did not allow elected bodies power. This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early Canadian nationalism. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions; Louis-Joseph Papineau led the Lower Canada Rebellion and William Lyon Mackenzie, first Toronto mayor, led the Upper Canada Rebellion. In Upper Canada, the rebellion was quickly a failure. William Lyon Mackenzie escaped to the United States, where he declared the Republic of Canada on Navy Island on the Niagara River.

===Canada West (1841–1867)===

Although both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent Lord Durham to investigate the causes. He recommended responsible government be granted, and Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the French Canadians. Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the Province of Canada by the &quot;Act of Union 1840&quot;, with the capital initially at Kingston, and Upper Canada becoming known as Canada West. Responsible government was achieved in 1848. There were heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s, and the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade. As a result, for the first time, the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of Canada East, tilting the representative balance of power.

In 1849, the districts of southern Ontario were abolished by the Province of Canada, and county governments took over certain municipal responsibilities. The Province of Canada also began creating &quot;districts&quot; in sparsely populated Northern Ontario with the establishment of Algoma District and Nipissing District in 1858.

An economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province, further increasing the economic strength of Central Canada. With the repeal of the Corn Laws and a reciprocity agreement in place with the United States, various industries such as timber, mining, farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously.

A political stalemate developed in the 1850s, between finely balanced political groups: conservative and reform groups from Canada West and Canada East aligned against reform and liberal groups from Canada East each group having some support from French-Canadian and English-Canadian legislators. There was also a fear of aggression from the United States during and immediately after the American Civil War. These factors led to the formation of the Great Coalition in the elected Legislative Assembly, which initiated a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all British North American colonies. The &quot;British North America Act&quot; took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with the four provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the &quot;British North America Act&quot; to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario&#x27;s provincial capital.

===Canadian province (1867–present)===

The borders of Ontario, its new name in 1867, were provisionally expanded north and west. When the Province of Canada was formed, its borders were not entirely clear, and Ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the Rocky Mountains and Arctic Ocean. With Canada&#x27;s acquisition of Rupert&#x27;s Land, Ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders, especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing. After the federal government asked Ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area, the province asked for an elaboration on its limits, and its boundary was moved north to the 51st parallel north.
Once constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the lawyer Oliver Mowat became Premier of Ontario and remained as premier until 1896. He fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. His battles with the federal government greatly decentralized Canada, giving the provinces far more power than John A. Macdonald had intended. He consolidated and expanded Ontario&#x27;s educational and provincial institutions, created districts in Northern Ontario, and fought to ensure that those parts of Northwestern Ontario not historically part of Upper Canada (the vast areas north and west of the Lake Superior-Hudson Bay watershed, known as the District of Keewatin) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the &quot;Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889&quot;. He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called &quot;Empire Ontario&quot;.

Beginning with Macdonald&#x27;s National Policy (1879) and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1875–1885) through Northern Ontario and the Canadian Prairies to British Columbia, Ontario manufacturing and industry flourished. However, population increases slowed after a large recession hit the province in 1893, thus slowing growth drastically but for only a few years. Many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railway to the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, sparsely settling Northern Ontario.

The northern and western boundaries of Ontario were in dispute after Canadian Confederation. Ontario&#x27;s right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1884 and confirmed by the &quot;Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889&quot; of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. By 1899, there were seven northern districts: Algoma, Manitoulin, Muskoka, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, and Thunder Bay. Four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912: Cochrane, Kenora, Sudbury and Timiskaming.

Mineral exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast, such as Sudbury, Cobalt and Timmins. The province harnessed its water power to generate hydro-electric power and created the state-controlled Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, later Ontario Hydro. The availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry. The Ford Motor Company of Canada was established in 1904 and the McLaughlin Motor Car Company (later General Motors Canada) was founded in 1907. The motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the Ontario economy during the 20th century.

In July 1912, the Conservative government of James Whitney issued Regulation 17 which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province&#x27;s French-speaking minority. French Canadians reacted with outrage, journalist Henri Bourassa denouncing the &quot;Prussians of Ontario&quot;. The regulation was eventually repealed in 1927.

Influenced by events in the United States, the government of William Hearst introduced prohibition of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the &quot;Ontario Temperance Act&quot;. However, residents could distil and retain their own personal supply, and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further. Ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the United States, which was under complete prohibition. Prohibition in Ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario under the government of Howard Ferguson. The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld.

The post-World War II period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth. Ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from war-torn Europe in the 1950s and 1960s and following changes in federal immigration law, a massive influx of non-Europeans since the 1970s. From a largely ethnically British province, Ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse.

The nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly after the election of the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; in 1976, contributed to driving many businesses and English-speaking people out of Quebec to Ontario, and as a result, Toronto surpassed Montreal as the largest city and economic centre of Canada. Depressed economic conditions in the Maritime Provinces have also resulted in de-population of those provinces in the 20th century, with heavy migration into Ontario.

Ontario&#x27;s official language is English, although there exists a number of French-speaking communities across Ontario. French-language services are made available for communities with a sizeable French-speaking population; a service that is ensured under the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot; of 1989.

== Demographics ==

=== Population ===
In the 2021 census, Ontario had a population of 14,223,942 living in 5,491,201 of its 5,929,250 total dwellings, a 5.8 percent change from its 2016 population of 13,448,494. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. The largest population centres in Ontario are Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, Kitchener, London and Oshawa, which all have more than 300,000 inhabitants.

=== Ethnicity ===
The percentages given below add to more than 100 per cent because of dual responses (e.g., &quot;French and Canadian&quot; response generates an entry both in the category &quot;French Canadian&quot; and in the category &quot;Canadian&quot;).

The majority of Ontarians are of English or other European descent including large Scottish, Irish and Italian communities. Slightly less than 5 per cent of the population of Ontario is Franco-Ontarian, that is those whose native tongue is French, although those with French ancestry account for 11 per cent of the population. Compared to natural increase or interprovincial migration, immigration is a huge population growth force in Ontario, as it has been over the last two centuries. More recent sources of immigrants with large or growing communities in Ontario include East Asians, South Asians, Caribbeans, Latin Americans, Europeans, and Africans. Most populations have settled in the larger urban centres.

=== Visible minorities and Indigenous peoples ===
In 2021, 34.3% of the population consisted of visible minorities and 2.9% of the population was Indigenous, mostly of First Nations and Métis descent. There was also a small number of Inuit in the province. The number of Indigenous people and visible minorities has been increasing at a faster rate than the general population of Ontario.

=== Religion ===

In 2021, 52.1% of the population was Christian, with the largest religious denominations being the Roman Catholic Church (with 26.0% of the population) and the United Church of Canada with (4.1%). Other religions included Islam (6.7%), Hinduism (4.1%). 31.6% of Ontarians had no religious affiliation.

The major religious groups in Ontario in 2021 were:
In Ontario, Catholics are represented by the Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Ontario and the Anglican Protestants by the Ecclesiastical Province of Ontario.

=== Language ===



As of the 2021 Canadian Census, the ten most spoken languages in the province included English (13,650,230 or 97.28%), French (1,550,545 or 11.05%), Mandarin (467,420 or 3.33%), Hindi (436,125 or 3.11%), Spanish (401,205 or 2.86%), Punjabi (397,865 or 2.84%), Cantonese (352,135 or 2.51%), Arabic (342,860 or 2.44%), Italian (312,800 or 2.23%), and Urdu (295,175 or 2.1%).

The principal language of Ontario is English, the province&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; official language, with approximately 97.2 per cent of Ontarians having proficiency in the language, although only 69.5 per cent of Ontarians reported English as their mother tongue in the 2016 Census. English is one of two official languages of Canada, with the other being French. English and French are the official languages of the courts in Ontario. Approximately 4.6 per cent of the population identified as francophone, and a total of 11.5 per cent of Ontarians reported having proficiency in French. Approximately 11.2 per cent of Ontarians reported being bilingual in both English and French. Approximately 2.5 per cent of Ontarians have no proficiency in either English or French.

Franco-Ontarians are concentrated in the northeastern, eastern, and extreme southern parts of the province, where under the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot;, provincial government services are required to be available in French if at least 10 per cent of a designated area&#x27;s population report French as their native language or if an urban centre has at least 5,000 francophones.

Other languages spoken by residents include Arabic, Bengali, Cantonese, Dutch, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Hebrew, Italian, Korean, Malayalam, Mandarin, Marathi, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Russian, Sinhalese, Somali, Spanish, Tagalog, Telugu, Tamil, Tibetan, Ukrainian, Urdu, and Vietnamese.

== Economy ==

Ontario is Canada&#x27;s leading manufacturing province, accounting for 52% of the total national manufacturing shipments in 2004. Ontario&#x27;s largest trading partner is the American state of Michigan. , Moody&#x27;s bond-rating agency rated Ontario debt at AA2/stable, while S&amp;P rated it AA−. Dominion Bond Rating Service rated it AA(low) in January 2013. Long known as a bastion of Canadian manufacturing and financial solvency, Ontario&#x27;s public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to be 38.4% in fiscal year 2023–2024.

Mining and the forest products industry, notably pulp and paper, are vital to the economy of Northern Ontario. As of 2011, roughly 200,000 ha are clearcut each year; herbicides for hardwood suppression are applied to a third of the total. There has been controversy over the Ring of Fire mineral deposit, and whether the province can afford to spend CAD$2.25 billion on a road from the Trans-Canada Highway near Kenora to the deposit, currently valued at CAD$60 billion.

An abundance of natural resources, excellent transportation links to the North American heartland and the inland Great Lakes making ocean access possible via container ships, have all contributed to making manufacturing the principal industry of the province, found mainly in the Golden Horseshoe region, which is the largest industrialized area in Canada, the southern end of the region being part of the North American Rust Belt. Important products include motor vehicles, iron, steel, food, electrical appliances, machinery, chemicals, and paper.

Hamilton is the largest steel manufacturing city in Canada followed closely by Sault Ste. Marie, and Sarnia is the centre for petrochemical production. Construction employed more than 6.5% of the province&#x27;s work force in June 2011. Ontario&#x27;s steel industry was once centred in Hamilton. Hamilton harbour, which can be seen from the QEW Skyway bridge, is an industrial wasteland; U.S. Steel-owned Stelco announced in the autumn of 2013 that it would close in 2014, with the loss of 875 jobs. The move flummoxed a union representative, who seemed puzzled why a plant with capacity of 2 million tonnes per annum would be shut while Canada imported 8 million tonnes of steel the previous year. Algoma Steel maintains a plant in Sault Ste Marie.

Ontario surpassed Michigan in car production, assembling more than 2,696,000 vehicles in 2004. Ontario has Chrysler plants in Windsor and Bramalea, two GM plants in Oshawa and one in Ingersoll, a Honda assembly plant in Alliston, Ford plants in Oakville and St. Thomas and Toyota assembly plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. However, as a result of steeply declining sales, in 2005, General Motors announced massive layoffs at production facilities across North America, including two large GM plants in Oshawa and a drive train facility in St. Catharines, that resulted in 8,000 job losses in Ontario alone. In 2006, Ford Motor Company announced between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs phased until 2012; Ontario was spared the worst, but job losses were announced for the St Thomas facility and the Windsor Casting plant. However, these losses will be offset by Ford&#x27;s recent announcement of a hybrid vehicle facility slated to begin production in 2007 at its Oakville plant and GM&#x27;s re-introduction of the Camaro which will be produced in Oshawa. On December 4, 2008, Toyota announced the grand opening of the RAV4 plant in Woodstock, and Honda also plans to add an engine plant at its facility in Alliston. Despite these new plants coming online, Ontario has not yet fully recovered following massive layoffs during the Great Recession; its unemployment rate was 7.3% in May 2013, compared to 8.7 percent in January 2010 and approximately 6% in 2007. In September 2013, the Ontario government committed CAD$70.9 million to the Ford plant in Oakville, while the federal government committed CAD$71.1mn, to secure 2,800 jobs. The province has lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs in the decade from 2003, and the Bank of Canada noted that &quot;while the energy and mining industries have benefitted from these movements, the pressure on the manufacturing sector has intensified, since many firms in this sector were already dealing with growing competition from low-cost economies such as China.&quot;

Toronto, the capital of Ontario, is the centre of Canada&#x27;s financial services and banking industry. Neighbouring cities are home to product distribution, IT centres, and manufacturing industries. Canada&#x27;s Federal Government is the largest single employer in the National Capital Region, which centres on the border cities of Ontario&#x27;s Ottawa and Quebec&#x27;s Gatineau.

The information technology sector is important, particularly in the &quot;Silicon Valley North&quot; section of Ottawa, home to Canada&#x27;s largest technology park. IT is also important in the Waterloo Region, where the headquarters of BlackBerry is located.

Tourism contributes heavily to the economy of Central Ontario, peaking during the summer months owing to the abundance of fresh water recreation and wilderness found there in reasonable proximity to the major urban centres. At other times of the year, hunting, skiing and snowmobiling are popular. This region has some of the most vibrant fall colour displays anywhere on the continent, and tours directed at overseas visitors are organized to see them. Tourism also plays a key role in border cities with large casinos, among them Windsor, Cornwall, Sarnia and Niagara Falls, the latter of which attracts millions of US and other international visitors.

=== Agriculture ===
Once the dominant industry, agriculture now uses a small percentage of the workforce. Massey Ferguson, a farm-implement manufacturer, was originally founded in the province in 1847, before eventually expanding internationally. As the following table shows, while the number of individual farms has steadily decreased and their overall size has shrunk at a lower rate, greater mechanization has supported increased supply to satisfy the ever-increasing demands of a growing population base; this has also meant a gradual increase in the total amount of land used for growing crops.
Common types of farms reported in the 2001 census include those for cattle, small grains and dairy. The fruit- and wine industry is primarily on the Niagara Peninsula, Prince Edward County, and along the northern shore of Lake Erie, where tobacco farms are also situated. Market vegetables grow in the rich soils of the Holland Marsh near Newmarket. The area near Windsor is also very fertile.

The area defined as the Corn Belt covers much of the southwestern area of the province, extending as far north as close to Goderich, but corn and soy are grown throughout the southern portion of the province. Apple orchards are a common sight along the southern shore of Nottawasaga Bay (part of Georgian Bay) near Collingwood and along the northern shore of Lake Ontario near Cobourg. Tobacco production, centred in Norfolk County, has decreased, allowing an increase in alternative crops such as hazelnuts and ginseng. Southern Ontario&#x27;s limited supply of agricultural land is going out of production at an increasing rate. Urban sprawl and farmland severances contribute to the loss of thousands of acres of productive agricultural land in Ontario each year. Over 2,000 farms and of farmland in the GTA alone were lost to production in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. This loss represented approximately 18%&quot;. of Ontario&#x27;s Class 1 farmland being converted to urban purposes. In addition, increasing rural severances provide ever-greater interference with agricultural production. In an effort to protect the farmland and green spaces of the National Capital Region, and Greater Toronto Area, the Federal and Provincial Governments introduced greenbelts around Ottawa and the Golden Horseshoe, limiting urban development in these areas.

=== Energy ===

Ontario&#x27;s rivers make it rich in hydroelectric energy. In 2009, Ontario Power Generation generated 70 percent of the province&#x27;s electricity, of which 51 percent is nuclear, 39% is hydroelectric and 10% is fossil-fuel derived. By 2025, nuclear power is projected to supply 42%, while fossil-fuel-derived generation is projected to decrease slightly over the next 20 years. Much of the newer power generation coming online in the last few years is natural gas or combined-cycle natural gas plants. OPG is not, however, responsible for the transmission of power, which is under the control of Hydro One.
Despite its diverse range of power options, problems related to increasing consumption, lack of energy efficiency and ageing nuclear reactors, Ontario has been forced in recent years to purchase power from its neighbours Quebec and Michigan to supplement its power needs during peak consumption periods. Ontario&#x27;s basic domestic rate in 2010 was 11.17 cents per kWh; by contrast. Quebec&#x27;s was 6.81. In December 2013, the government projected a 42 percent hike by 2018, and 68 percent by 2033. Industrial rates are projected to rise by 33% by 2018, and 55% in 2033.

The &quot;Green Energy and Green Economy Act&quot;, 2009 (GEA), takes a two-pronged approach to commercializing renewable energy; first, it aims to bring more renewable energy sources to the province; and secondly, it aims to adopt more energy-efficiency measures to help conserve energy. The bill envisaged appointing a Renewable Energy Facilitator to provide &quot;one-window&quot; assistance and support to project developers to facilitate project approvals.

The approvals process for transmission projects would also be and (for the first time in Ontario) the bill would enact standards for renewable energy projects. Homeowners would have access to incentives to develop small-scale renewables such as low- or no-interest loans to finance the capital cost of renewable energy generating facilities like solar panels.

Ontario is home to Niagara Falls, which supplies a large amount of electricity to the province. The Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, the second largest operational nuclear power plant in the world, is also in Ontario and uses 8 CANDU reactors to generate electricity for the province.

Ontario had the most wind energy capacity of the country with 4,900 MW of power (41% of Canada&#x27;s capacity).

== Government, law and politics ==

The &quot;British North America Act 1867&quot; section 69 stipulated &quot;There shall be a Legislature for Ontario consisting of the Lieutenant Governor and of One House, styled the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.&quot; The assembly currently has 124 seats (increased from 107 as of the 42nd Ontario general election) representing ridings elected in a first-past-the-post system across the province.

The legislative buildings at Queen&#x27;s Park are the seat of government. Following the Westminster system, the leader of the party holding the most seats in the assembly is known as the &quot;Premier and President of the Council&quot; (Executive Council Act R.S.O. 1990). The Premier chooses the cabinet or Executive Council whose members are deemed ministers of the Crown.

Although the &quot;Legislative Assembly Act&quot; (R.S.O. 1990) refers to &quot;members of the assembly&quot; in English and in French, the legislators are now commonly called MPPs (Members of the Provincial Parliament) in English, but they have also been called MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly); both are acceptable but the latter is uncommon. The title of Prime Minister of Ontario, correct in French (), is permissible in English but now generally avoided in favour of the title &quot;Premier&quot; to avoid confusion with the Prime Minister of Canada.

=== Law ===
Ontario has grown, from its roots in Upper Canada, into a modern jurisdiction. The old titles of the chief law officers, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, remain in use. They both are responsible to the Legislature. The Attorney-General draughts the laws and is responsible for criminal prosecutions and the administration of justice, while the Solicitor-General is responsible for law enforcement and the police services of the province. The &quot;Municipal Act&quot; is the main statute governing the creation, administration and government of municipalities in the Canadian province of Ontario, other than the City of Toronto. After being passed in 2001, it came into force on January 1, 2003, replacing the previous &quot;Municipal Act&quot;. Effective January 1, 2007, the &quot;Municipal Act&quot; (the Act) was significantly amended by the &quot;Municipal Statute Law Amendment Act, 2006&quot; (Bill 130).

=== Politics ===
Ontario has numerous political parties which run for election. The four main parties are the centre-right Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, the social democratic Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP), the centre to centre-left Ontario Liberal Party, and Green Party of Ontario. The Progressive Conservatives, Liberals and New Democrats have each governed the province, while the Greens elected their first member to the Legislative Assembly in 2018.

The 2018 provincial election resulted in a Progressive Conservative majority government under party leader Doug Ford, who was sworn in as Premier on June 29. Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath was sworn in as the leader of her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition.

===Administrative divisions===
Ontario has three types of first-level administrative divisions. They include single-tier municipalities, upper-tier municipalities (which may be in the form of either regional municipalities or counties), and districts. Upper-tier municipalities and districts are made up of smaller municipalities and other types of administrative divisions.

Administrative divisions differ primarily in the services that they provide to their residents, with the differing structures of these administrative regions resulting in disparities among Ontario&#x27;s different regions. The administrative regions of Ontario are roughly coterminous with the census divisions used by Statistics Canada, although some exceptions do exist.

=== Urban areas ===

Statistics Canada&#x27;s measure of a &quot;metro area&quot;, the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), roughly bundles together population figures from the core municipality with those from &quot;commuter&quot; municipalities.

*Parts of Quebec (including Gatineau) are included in the Ottawa CMA. The population of the Ottawa CMA, in both provinces, is shown. The Ontario portion of the CMA is about 75% of the total population of the CMA.

;Ten largest municipalities by population
== Education ==

Ontario operates four publicly funded school systems, with there being both English and French equivalents of the public school system and the Catholic school system. About half of Ontario&#x27;s government-funded District School Boards are Catholic (37 out of 72). There are some publicly funded schools with non-Catholic religious affiliation: these include Eden High School (under the District School Board of Niagara) and the Burkevale Protestant Separate School (under the Penetanguishene Protestant Separate School Board). Legislation regarding primary and secondary level education in Ontario is outlined in the &quot;Education Act&quot;. , two million children were enrolled as students within the province. Elementary schools teach children enrolled in kindergarten and grades 1–8, while secondary schools teach adolescents in grades 9–12. Four and five year olds may enter kindergarten programs but are not required by law to do so until they turn six that calendar year.

=== Higher education ===
Higher education in Ontario includes postsecondary education and skills training regulated by the Ministry of Colleges and Universities, whose current minister is Jill Dunlop. Recognized institutions include universities, colleges of applied arts and technology, and private career colleges. While there is some overlap between the purpose of universities and colleges in Canada, they generally serve different purposes. Universities place greater emphasis on academics while colleges place greater emphasis on work-integrated learning. Both colleges and universities can offer undergraduate degree programs. There are also programs that involve a partnership between a college and a university. Some students choose to attend college over university because it is the more affordable option.

== Culture ==
Outdoor recreation is popular in Ontario and the region is home to numerous cultural events and festivals. There is no single regional dish in Ontario. Local fish and wild game, such as walleye and moose, are sometimes consumed. Poutine, a dish that originated in Quebec, is also popular in Ontario.

In 2019, the government of Ontario passed legislation that established the Poet Laureate of Ontario.

=== Museums ===
The largest museum in both Ontario and Canada is the Royal Ontario Museum, located in Toronto and founded in 1912. Receiving over one million visitors each year, it is also Canada&#x27;s most popular museum. It features 40 exhibits containing &quot;art, culture and nature from around the world.&quot; Iconic objects include: the world&#x27;s largest faceted cerussite gem, Light of the Desert; four large totem poles, Nisga&#x27;a and Haida; and a Neo-Babylonian wall relief, Striding Lion. Ontario is also home to a number of national museums, due to the location of Ottawa. These include, among others, the Canadian War Museum, dedicated to Canada&#x27;s military history, the Canadian Museum of Nature, dedicated to natural history and the Canada Science and Technology Museum, dedicated to the history of science and technology in Canada. There are also numerous other smaller, regional museums located in Ontario.

=== Music and arts ===
Ontario has a particularly prominent role in Canadian music. The provincial capital city of Toronto, Canada&#x27;s largest municipality, In classical music, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and the National Arts Centre Orchestra are renowned internationally. Many smaller Ontario cities have orchestras of their own as well. The Canadian Opera Company, also based in Toronto, is the country&#x27;s largest and most influential producer of opera productions. Other institutions in the province include the Royal Conservatory of Music, MuchMusic, National Ballet of Canada and concert venues such as Roy Thomson Hall, Massey Hall, the National Arts Centre, and the Four Seasons Centre.

=== Media ===
, Ontario has 357 newspapers, 32 of which are daily, the highest in any province. Ontario is home to the largest newspaper in Canada, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, and Canada&#x27;s newspaper of record, The Globe and Mail. There are also numerous weekly newspapers for individual communities, though print publications for these papers have been on a downwards trend due to local news being shared on sites like Facebook.

=== Songs and slogans ===

In 1973, the first slogan to appear on licence plates in Ontario was &quot;Keep It Beautiful&quot;. This was replaced by &quot;Yours to Discover&quot; in 1982, which was originally used as a tourism slogan beginning in 1980. Plates with the French equivalent, , were made available to the public beginning in May 2008. (From 1988 to 1990, &quot;Ontario Incredible&quot; gave &quot;Yours to Discover&quot; a brief respite.) In 2020, as part of a licence plate redesign, the slogan was changed to &quot;A Place to Grow,&quot; inspired by the song A Place to Stand, a Place to Grow. This decision was reversed in the same year, due to visibility concerns. The slogan on licence plates remains &quot;Yours to Discover&quot;.

A Place to Stand, a Place to Grow is a song commissioned by the government of Ontario for its pavilion in Expo 67, and an unofficial anthem of the province. As a part of the Canada 150 celebrations in 2017, the provincial government released an updated rendition. In 2007, the provincial tourism agency commissioned a new song, &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like This&quot; is featured in television advertising, performed by Ontario artists including Molly Johnson, Brian Byrne, Keshia Chanté, as well as Tomi Swick and Arkells.

=== Professional sports ===
The province has professional sports teams in baseball, basketball, Canadian football, ice hockey, lacrosse, rugby league, rugby union and soccer.

=== Notable residents ===
== Transportation ==
Transportation in Ontario is under the purview of the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario and Transport Canada. Infrastructure and laws relating to road transport is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation, while infrastructure and laws relating to air, rail and marine transport is the responsibility of Transport Canada.

=== Air travel ===

, there are two Transport Canada designated international airports in Ontario They are Toronto Pearson International Airport, the busiest airport in Canada, handling 44 million passengers in 2023 and Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport, Ontario&#x27;s second largest airport, handling over 4 million passengers in 2023. In addition to airports in Ottawa, and Toronto, the province also operates 11 other airports of entry.

A number of Ontario cities also have regional airports, many of which have scheduled commuter flights from Jazz Aviation or smaller airlines and charter companies – flights from mid-size cities such as Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie, to larger airports in Toronto and Ottawa. Bearskin Airlines also runs flights along the northerly east–west route, connecting North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, and Thunder Bay directly.

Remote and isolated towns and settlements in the northern areas of the province rely partly or entirely on air service for travel, goods, and even ambulance services (MEDIVAC), since much of the far northern area of the province cannot be reached by road (or by year-round road) or rail.

=== Railways ===
Via Rail operates the inter-regional passenger train service on the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, along with &quot;The Canadian&quot;, a transcontinental rail service from Southern Ontario to Vancouver, and the Sudbury–White River train. Additionally, Amtrak rail connects Ontario with key New York cities including Buffalo, Albany, and New York City. Ontario Northland provides rail service to destinations as far north as Moosonee near James Bay, connecting them with the south. Regional commuter rail is limited to the provincially owned GO Transit, and serves a train-bus network spanning the Golden Horseshoe region, with Union Station in Toronto serving as the transport hub.

Freight rail is dominated by the founding cross-country Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (formerly CP Rail) companies. As of 2021, there are 19,979 km of railways in operation.

There are several city rail-transit systems in the Province. The Toronto Transit Commission operates subways, as well as streetcars (being one of the busiest streetcar systems in North America). OC Transpo operates a light rail metro system in Ottawa. In addition, Waterloo region operates a surface light rail system called Ion. Construction on light rail lines, such as the Hurontario LRT, are also underway in the Regional Municipality of Peel, and are expected to be completed by late 2024.

=== Roads ===
400-series highways make up the primary vehicular network in the south of province, and they connect at a number of points to border crossings to the United States, and Quebec, the busiest being the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel and Ambassador Bridge and the Blue Water Bridge (via Highway 402). Some of the primary highways along the southern route are Highway 401, Highway 417, and Highway 400, Highway 401 being the busiest highway in North America. Other provincial highways and regional roads inter-connect the remainder of the province, and the Trans-Canada Highway connects the province to the rest of the country.

=== Waterways ===

The Saint Lawrence Seaway, which extends across most of the southern portion of the province and connects to the Atlantic Ocean, is the primary water transportation route for cargo, particularly iron ore and grain. In the past, the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River were also a major passenger transportation route, including with the early 20th century growth of Canada Steamship Lines, but in the 1930s, passenger traffic greatly declined, and though some cruise lines still exist, as of 2022 less than 20% of traffic were non-cargo or passenger ships. Ontario&#x27;s three largest ports are the Port of Hamilton, Port of Thunder Bay and the Port of Nanticoke. Ontario&#x27;s only saltwater port is located in the town of Moosonee on James Bay.
