<text>In mathematics, a group is a set with an operation that satisfies the following constraints: the operation is associative, it has an identity element, and every element of the set has an inverse element. 

Many mathematical structures are groups endowed with other properties. For example, the integers with the addition operation form an infinite group, which is generated by a single element called (these properties characterize the integers in a unique way).

The concept of a group was elaborated for handling, in a unified way, many mathematical structures such as numbers, geometric shapes and polynomial roots. Because the concept of groups is ubiquitous in numerous areas both within and outside mathematics, some authors consider it as a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.

In geometry, groups arise naturally in the study of symmetries and geometric transformations: The symmetries of an object form a group, called the symmetry group of the object, and the transformations of a given type form a general group. Lie groups appear in symmetry groups in geometry, and also in the Standard Model of particle physics. The Poincaré group is a Lie group consisting of the symmetries of spacetime in special relativity. Point groups describe symmetry in molecular chemistry.

The concept of a group arose in the study of polynomial equations, starting with Évariste Galois in the 1830s, who introduced the term &quot;group&quot; (French: ) for the symmetry group of the roots of an equation, now called a Galois group. After contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870. Modern group theory—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right. To explore groups, mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of representation theory (that is, through the representations of the group) and of computational group theory. A theory has been developed for finite groups, which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups, completed in 2004. Since the mid-1980s, geometric group theory, which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects, has become an active area in group theory.


== Definition and illustration ==

=== First example: the integers ===
One of the more familiar groups is the set of integers 
formula_1
together with addition. For any two integers formula_2 and , the sum formula_3 is also an integer; this &quot;closure&quot; property says that formula_4 is a binary operation on . The following properties of integer addition serve as a model for the group axioms in the definition below.
* For all integers , formula_5 and , one has . Expressed in words, adding formula_2 to formula_5 first, and then adding the result to formula_8 gives the same final result as adding formula_2 to the sum of formula_5 and . This property is known as &quot;associativity&quot;.
* If formula_2 is any integer, then formula_12 and . Zero is called the &quot;identity element&quot; of addition because adding it to any integer returns the same integer.
* For every integer , there is an integer formula_5 such that formula_14 and . The integer formula_5 is called the &quot;inverse element&quot; of the integer formula_2 and is denoted .

The integers, together with the operation , form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To appropriately understand these structures as a collective, the following definition is developed.

=== Definition ===
A group is a non-empty set formula_17 together with a binary operation on , here denoted &quot;&quot;, that combines any two elements formula_2 and formula_5 of formula_17 to form an element of , denoted , such that the following three requirements, known as group axioms, are satisfied:

; Associativity : For all , , in , one has .
; Identity element : There exists an element formula_21 in formula_17 such that, for every formula_2 in , one has and .
: Such an element is unique (see below). It is called the &quot;identity element&quot; (or sometimes &quot;neutral element&quot;) of the group.
; Inverse element : For each formula_2 in , there exists an element formula_5 in formula_17 such that formula_27 and , where formula_21 is the identity element.
: For each , the element formula_5 is unique (see below); it is called &quot;the inverse&quot; of formula_2 and is commonly denoted .

=== Notation and terminology ===
Formally, a group is an ordered pair of a set and a binary operation on this set that satisfies the group axioms. The set is called the &quot;underlying set&quot; of the group, and the operation is called the &quot;group operation&quot; or the &quot;group law&quot;.

A group and its underlying set are thus two different mathematical objects. To avoid cumbersome notation, it is common to abuse notation by using the same symbol to denote both. This reflects also an informal way of thinking: that the group is the same as the set except that it has been enriched by additional structure provided by the operation.

For example, consider the set of real numbers , which has the operations of addition formula_3 and multiplication . Formally, formula_32 is a set, formula_33 is a group, and formula_34 is a field. But it is common to write formula_32 to denote any of these three objects.

The &quot;additive group&quot; of the field formula_32 is the group whose underlying set is formula_32 and whose operation is addition. The &quot;multiplicative group&quot; of the field formula_32 is the group formula_39 whose underlying set is the set of nonzero real numbers formula_40 and whose operation is multiplication.

More generally, one speaks of an &quot;additive group&quot; whenever the group operation is notated as addition; in this case, the identity is typically denoted , and the inverse of an element formula_41 is denoted . Similarly, one speaks of a &quot;multiplicative group&quot; whenever the group operation is notated as multiplication; in this case, the identity is typically denoted , and the inverse of an element formula_41 is denoted . In a multiplicative group, the operation symbol is usually omitted entirely, so that the operation is denoted by juxtaposition, formula_43 instead of .

The definition of a group does not require that formula_44 for all elements formula_2 and formula_5 in . If this additional condition holds, then the operation is said to be commutative, and the group is called an abelian group. It is a common convention that for an abelian group either additive or multiplicative notation may be used, but for a nonabelian group only multiplicative notation is used.

Several other notations are commonly used for groups whose elements are not numbers. For a group whose elements are functions, the operation is often function composition ; then the identity may be denoted id. In the more specific cases of geometric transformation groups, symmetry groups, permutation groups, and automorphism groups, the symbol formula_47 is often omitted, as for multiplicative groups. Many other variants of notation may be encountered.

=== Second example: a symmetry group ===
Two figures in the plane are congruent if one can be changed into the other using a combination of rotations, reflections, and translations. Any figure is congruent to itself. However, some figures are congruent to themselves in more than one way, and these extra congruences are called symmetries. A square has eight symmetries. These are:

* the identity operation leaving everything unchanged, denoted id;
* rotations of the square around its center by 90°, 180°, and 270° clockwise, denoted by , formula_48 and , respectively;
* reflections about the horizontal and vertical middle line ( and ), or through the two diagonals ( and ).
These symmetries are functions. Each sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry. For example, formula_49 sends a point to its rotation 90° clockwise around the square&#x27;s center, and formula_50 sends a point to its reflection across the square&#x27;s vertical middle line. Composing two of these symmetries gives another symmetry. These symmetries determine a group called the dihedral group of degree four, denoted . The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetries, and the group operation is function composition. Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to the square, and the second one to the result of the first application. The result of performing first formula_2 and then formula_5 is written symbolically &quot;from right to left&quot; as formula_53 (&quot;apply the symmetry formula_5 after performing the symmetry &quot;). This is the usual notation for composition of functions.

A Cayley table lists the results of all such compositions possible. For example, rotating by 270° clockwise () and then reflecting horizontally () is the same as performing a reflection along the diagonal (). Using the above symbols, highlighted in blue in the Cayley table:
formula_55
Given this set of symmetries and the described operation, the group axioms can be understood as follows.

&quot;Binary operation&quot;: Composition is a binary operation. That is, formula_56 is a symmetry for any two symmetries formula_2 and . For example,
formula_58
that is, rotating 270° clockwise after reflecting horizontally equals reflecting along the counter-diagonal (). Indeed, every other combination of two symmetries still gives a symmetry, as can be checked using the Cayley table.

&quot;Associativity&quot;: The associativity axiom deals with composing more than two symmetries: Starting with three elements , and of , there are two possible ways of using these three symmetries in this order to determine a symmetry of the square. One of these ways is to first compose formula_2 and formula_5 into a single symmetry, then to compose that symmetry with . The other way is to first compose formula_5 and , then to compose the resulting symmetry with . These two ways must give always the same result, that is,
formula_62
For example, formula_63 can be checked using the Cayley table:
formula_64

&quot;Identity element&quot;: The identity element is , as it does not change any symmetry formula_2 when composed with it either on the left or on the right.

&quot;Inverse element&quot;: Each symmetry has an inverse: , the reflections , , , and the 180° rotation formula_48 are their own inverse, because performing them twice brings the square back to its original orientation. The rotations formula_67 and formula_49 are each other&#x27;s inverses, because rotating 90° and then rotation 270° (or vice versa) yields a rotation over 360° which leaves the square unchanged. This is easily verified on the table.

In contrast to the group of integers above, where the order of the operation is immaterial, it does matter in , as, for example, formula_69 but . In other words, formula_70 is not abelian.

== History ==

The modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics. The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician Évariste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions). The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois&#x27;s ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously. More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy. Arthur Cayley&#x27;s &quot;On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation formula_71&quot; (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a finite group.

Geometry was a second field in which groups were used systematically, especially symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein&#x27;s 1872 Erlangen program. After novel geometries such as hyperbolic and projective geometry had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884.

The third field contributing to group theory was number theory. Certain abelian group structures had been used implicitly in Carl Friedrich Gauss&#x27;s number-theoretical work &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; (1798), and more explicitly by Leopold Kronecker. In 1847, Ernst Kummer made early attempts to prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem by developing groups describing factorization into prime numbers.

The convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with Camille Jordan&#x27;s (1870). Walther von Dyck (1882) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations, and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an &quot;abstract group&quot;, in the terminology of the time. As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and William Burnside (who worked on representation theory of finite groups), Richard Brauer&#x27;s modular representation theory and Issai Schur&#x27;s papers. The theory of Lie groups, and more generally locally compact groups was studied by Hermann Weyl, Élie Cartan and many others. Its algebraic counterpart, the theory of algebraic groups, was first shaped by Claude Chevalley (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of Armand Borel and Jacques Tits.

The University of Chicago&#x27;s 1960–61 Group Theory Year brought together group theorists such as Daniel Gorenstein, John G. Thompson and Walter Feit, laying the foundation of a collaboration that, with input from numerous other mathematicians, led to the classification of finite simple groups, with the final step taken by Aschbacher and Smith in 2004. This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size, in both length of proof and number of researchers. Research concerning this classification proof is ongoing. Group theory remains a highly active mathematical branch, impacting many other fields, as the examples below illustrate.

== Elementary consequences of the group axioms ==
Basic facts about all groups that can be obtained directly from the group axioms are commonly subsumed under &quot;elementary group theory&quot;. For example, repeated applications of the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity of
formula_72
generalizes to more than three factors. Because this implies that parentheses can be inserted anywhere within such a series of terms, parentheses are usually omitted.

=== Uniqueness of identity element ===
The group axioms imply that the identity element is unique; that is, there exists only one identity element: any two identity elements formula_21 and formula_74 of a group are equal, because the group axioms imply . It is thus customary to speak of &quot;the&quot; identity element of the group.

=== Uniqueness of inverses ===
The group axioms also imply that the inverse of each element is unique. Let a group element formula_2 have both formula_5 and formula_8 as inverses. Then
: formula_78

Therefore, it is customary to speak of &quot;the&quot; inverse of an element.

=== Division ===
Given elements formula_2 and formula_5 of a group , there is a unique solution formula_41 in formula_17 to the equation , namely . It follows that for each formula_2 in formula_17, the function formula_85 that maps each formula_41 to formula_87 is a bijection; it is called &quot;left multiplication&quot; by formula_2 or &quot;left translation&quot; by .

Similarly, given formula_2 and , the unique solution to formula_90 is . For each , the function formula_85 that maps each formula_41 to formula_93 is a bijection called &quot;right multiplication&quot; by formula_2 or &quot;right translation&quot; by .

=== Equivalent definition with relaxed axioms ===
The group axioms for identity and inverses may be &quot;weakened&quot; to assert only the existence of a left identity and left inverses. From these &quot;one-sided axioms&quot;, one can prove that the left identity is also a right identity and a left inverse is also a right inverse for the same element. Since they define exactly the same structures as groups, collectively the axioms are not weaker.

In particular, assuming associativity and the existence of a left identity formula_21 (that is, ) and a left inverse formula_96 for each element formula_74 (that is, ), one can show that every left inverse is also a right inverse of the same element as follows.
Indeed, one has
: formula_98

Similarly, the left identity is also a right identity:
: formula_99

These proofs require all three axioms (associativity, existence of left identity and existence of left inverse). For a structure with a looser definition (like a semigroup) one may have, for example, that a left identity is not necessarily a right identity.

The same result can be obtained by only assuming the existence of a right identity and a right inverse.

However, only assuming the existence of a &quot;left&quot; identity and a &quot;right&quot; inverse (or vice versa) is not sufficient to define a group. For example, consider the set formula_100 with the operator formula_101 satisfying formula_102 and . This structure does have a left identity (namely, ), and each element has a right inverse (which is formula_21 for both elements). Furthermore, this operation is associative (since the product of any number of elements is always equal to the rightmost element in that product, regardless of the order in which these operations are done). However, formula_104 is not a group, since it lacks a right identity.

== Basic concepts ==
When studying sets, one uses concepts such as subset, function, and quotient by an equivalence relation. When studying groups, one uses instead subgroups, homomorphisms, and quotient groups. These are the analogues that take the group structure into account.

=== Group homomorphisms ===

Group homomorphisms are functions that respect group structure; they may be used to relate two groups. A &quot;homomorphism&quot; from a group formula_105 to a group formula_106 is a function formula_107 such that

It would be natural to require also that formula_108 respect identities, , and inverses, formula_109 for all formula_2 in . However, these additional requirements need not be included in the definition of homomorphisms, because they are already implied by the requirement of respecting the group operation.

The &quot;identity homomorphism&quot; of a group formula_17 is the homomorphism formula_112 that maps each element of formula_17 to itself. An &quot;inverse homomorphism&quot; of a homomorphism formula_107 is a homomorphism formula_115 such that formula_116 and , that is, such that formula_117 for all formula_118 in formula_17 and such that formula_120 for all formula_121 in . An &quot;isomorphism&quot; is a homomorphism that has an inverse homomorphism; equivalently, it is a bijective homomorphism. Groups formula_17 and formula_123 are called &quot;isomorphic&quot; if there exists an isomorphism . In this case, formula_123 can be obtained from formula_17 simply by renaming its elements according to the function ; then any statement true for formula_17 is true for , provided that any specific elements mentioned in the statement are also renamed.

The collection of all groups, together with the homomorphisms between them, form a category, the category of groups.

An injective homomorphism formula_127 factors canonically as an isomorphism followed by an inclusion, formula_128 for some subgroup of .
Injective homomorphisms are the monomorphisms in the category of groups.

=== Subgroups ===

Informally, a &quot;subgroup&quot; is a group formula_123 contained within a bigger one, : it has a subset of the elements of , with the same operation. Concretely, this means that the identity element of formula_17 must be contained in , and whenever formula_131 and formula_132 are both in , then so are formula_133 and , so the elements of , equipped with the group operation on formula_17 restricted to , indeed form a group. In this case, the inclusion map formula_135 is a homomorphism.

In the example of symmetries of a square, the identity and the rotations constitute a subgroup , highlighted in red in the Cayley table of the example: any two rotations composed are still a rotation, and a rotation can be undone by (i.e., is inverse to) the complementary rotations 270° for 90°, 180° for 180°, and 90° for 270°. The subgroup test provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a nonempty subset of a group to be a subgroup: it is sufficient to check that formula_136 for all elements formula_118 and formula_121 in . Knowing a group&#x27;s subgroups is important in understanding the group as a whole.

Given any subset formula_139 of a group , the subgroup generated by formula_139 consists of all products of elements of formula_139 and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup of formula_17 containing . In the example of symmetries of a square, the subgroup generated by formula_48 and formula_144 consists of these two elements, the identity element , and the element . Again, this is a subgroup, because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses (which are, in this particular case, these same elements) yields an element of this subgroup.

=== Cosets ===

In many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup. For example, in the symmetry group of a square, once any reflection is performed, rotations alone cannot return the square to its original position, so one can think of the reflected positions of the square as all being equivalent to each other, and as inequivalent to the unreflected positions; the rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been performed. Cosets are used to formalize this insight: a subgroup formula_123 determines left and right cosets, which can be thought of as translations of formula_123 by an arbitrary group element . In symbolic terms, the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; cosets of , containing an element , are

The left cosets of any subgroup formula_123 form a partition of ; that is, the union of all left cosets is equal to formula_17 and two left cosets are either equal or have an empty intersection. The first case formula_149 happens precisely when , i.e., when the two elements differ by an element of . Similar considerations apply to the right cosets of . The left cosets of formula_123 may or may not be the same as its right cosets. If they are (that is, if all formula_118 in formula_17 satisfy ), then formula_123 is said to be a &quot;normal subgroup&quot;.

In , the group of symmetries of a square, with its subgroup formula_154 of rotations, the left cosets formula_155 are either equal to , if formula_118 is an element of formula_154 itself, or otherwise equal to formula_158 (highlighted in green in the Cayley table of ). The subgroup formula_154 is normal, because formula_160 and similarly for the other elements of the group. (In fact, in the case of , the cosets generated by reflections are all equal: .)

=== Quotient groups ===

Suppose that formula_161 is a normal subgroup of a group , and
formula_162
denotes its set of cosets.
Then there is a unique group law on formula_163 for which the map formula_164 sending each element formula_118 to formula_166 is a homomorphism.
Explicitly, the product of two cosets formula_166 and formula_168 is , the coset formula_169 serves as the identity of , and the inverse of formula_166 in the quotient group is .
The group , read as &quot; modulo &quot;, is called a &quot;quotient group&quot; or &quot;factor group&quot;.
The quotient group can alternatively be characterized by a universal property.
The elements of the quotient group formula_171 are formula_154 and . The group operation on the quotient is shown in the table. For example, . Both the subgroup formula_173 and the quotient formula_171 are abelian, but formula_70 is not. Sometimes a group can be reconstructed from a subgroup and quotient (plus some additional data), by the semidirect product construction; formula_70 is an example.

The first isomorphism theorem implies that any surjective homomorphism formula_177 factors canonically as a quotient homomorphism followed by an isomorphism: .
Surjective homomorphisms are the epimorphisms in the category of groups.

=== Presentations ===

Every group is isomorphic to a quotient of a free group, in many ways.

For example, the dihedral group formula_70 is generated by the right rotation formula_49 and the reflection formula_144 in a vertical line (every element of formula_70 is a finite product of copies of these and their inverses).
Hence there is a surjective homomorphism from the free group formula_182 on two generators to formula_70 sending formula_184 to formula_49 and formula_74 to .
Elements in formula_187 are called &quot;relations&quot;; examples include .
In fact, it turns out that formula_187 is the smallest normal subgroup of formula_182 containing these three elements; in other words, all relations are consequences of these three.
The quotient of the free group by this normal subgroup is denoted .
This is called a &quot;presentation&quot; of formula_70 by generators and relations, because the first isomorphism theorem for yields an isomorphism . 

A presentation of a group can be used to construct the Cayley graph, a graphical depiction of a discrete group.

== Examples and applications ==

Examples and applications of groups abound. A starting point is the group formula_191 of integers with addition as group operation, introduced above. If instead of addition multiplication is considered, one obtains multiplicative groups. These groups are predecessors of important constructions in abstract algebra.

Groups are also applied in many other mathematical areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.
Elements of the fundamental group of a topological space are equivalence classes of loops, where loops are considered equivalent if one can be smoothly deformed into another, and the group operation is &quot;concatenation&quot; (tracing one loop then the other). For example, as shown in the figure, if the topological space is the plane with one point removed, then loops which do not wrap around the missing point (blue) can be smoothly contracted to a single point and are the identity element of the fundamental group. A loop which wraps around the missing point formula_192 times cannot be deformed into a loop which wraps formula_193 times (with ), because the loop cannot be smoothly deformed across the hole, so each class of loops is characterized by its winding number around the missing point. The resulting group is isomorphic to the integers under addition.

In more recent applications, the influence has also been reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background. In a similar vein, geometric group theory employs geometric concepts, for example in the study of hyperbolic groups. Further branches crucially applying groups include algebraic geometry and number theory.

In addition to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. Cryptography relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtained in computational group theory, in particular when implemented for finite groups. Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as physics, chemistry and computer science benefit from the concept.

=== Numbers ===
Many number systems, such as the integers and the rationals, enjoy a naturally given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as rings and fields. Further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.

==== Integers ====
The group of integers formula_191 under addition, denoted , has been described above. The integers, with the operation of multiplication instead of addition, formula_195 do &quot;not&quot; form a group. The associativity and identity axioms are satisfied, but inverses do not exist: for example, formula_196 is an integer, but the only solution to the equation formula_197 in this case is , which is a rational number, but not an integer. Hence not every element of formula_191 has a (multiplicative) inverse.

==== Rationals ====
The desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses suggests considering fractions
formula_199

Fractions of integers (with formula_5 nonzero) are known as rational numbers. The set of all such irreducible fractions is commonly denoted . There is still a minor obstacle for , the rationals with multiplication, being a group: because zero does not have a multiplicative inverse (i.e., there is no formula_41 such that ), formula_202 is still not a group.

However, the set of all &quot;nonzero&quot; rational numbers formula_203 does form an abelian group under multiplication, also denoted . Associativity and identity element axioms follow from the properties of integers. The closure requirement still holds true after removing zero, because the product of two nonzero rationals is never zero. Finally, the inverse of formula_204 is , therefore the axiom of the inverse element is satisfied.

The rational numbers (including zero) also form a group under addition. Intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called rings and – if division by other than zero is possible, such as in formula_205 – fields, which occupy a central position in abstract algebra. Group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts of the theory of those entities.

=== Modular arithmetic ===

Modular arithmetic for a &quot;modulus&quot; formula_206 defines any two elements formula_2 and formula_5 that differ by a multiple of formula_206 to be equivalent, denoted by . Every integer is equivalent to one of the integers from formula_210 to , and the operations of modular arithmetic modify normal arithmetic by replacing the result of any operation by its equivalent representative. Modular addition, defined in this way for the integers from formula_210 to , forms a group, denoted as formula_212 or , with formula_210 as the identity element and formula_214 as the inverse element of .

A familiar example is addition of hours on the face of a clock, where 12 rather than 0 is chosen as the representative of the identity. If the hour hand is on formula_215 and is advanced formula_216 hours, it ends up on , as shown in the illustration. This is expressed by saying that formula_217 is congruent to formula_218 &quot;modulo &quot; or, in symbols,
formula_219

For any prime number , there is also the multiplicative group of integers modulo. Its elements can be represented by formula_218 to . The group operation, multiplication modulo , replaces the usual product by its representative, the remainder of division by . For example, for , the four group elements can be represented by . In this group, , because the usual product formula_221 is equivalent to : when divided by formula_222 it yields a remainder of . The primality of formula_223 ensures that the usual product of two representatives is not divisible by , and therefore that the modular product is nonzero. The identity element is represented by , and associativity follows from the corresponding property of the integers. Finally, the inverse element axiom requires that given an integer formula_2 not divisible by , there exists an integer formula_5 such that 
formula_226
that is, such that formula_223 evenly divides . The inverse formula_5 can be found by using Bézout&#x27;s identity and the fact that the greatest common divisor formula_229 equals . In the case formula_230 above, the inverse of the element represented by formula_216 is that represented by , and the inverse of the element represented by formula_232 is represented by , as . Hence all group axioms are fulfilled. This example is similar to formula_233 above: it consists of exactly those elements in the ring formula_234 that have a multiplicative inverse. These groups, denoted , are crucial to public-key cryptography.

=== Cyclic groups ===
A &quot;cyclic group&quot; is a group all of whose elements are powers of a particular element formula_2. In multiplicative notation, the elements of the group are
formula_236
where formula_237 means , formula_238 stands for , etc. Such an element formula_2 is called a generator or a primitive element of the group. In additive notation, the requirement for an element to be primitive is that each element of the group can be written as
formula_240

In the groups formula_241 introduced above, the element formula_218 is primitive, so these groups are cyclic. Indeed, each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are . Any cyclic group with formula_206 elements is isomorphic to this group. A second example for cyclic groups is the group of th complex roots of unity, given by complex numbers formula_244 satisfying . These numbers can be visualized as the vertices on a regular formula_206-gon, as shown in blue in the image for . The group operation is multiplication of complex numbers. In the picture, multiplying with formula_244 corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation by 60°. From field theory, the group formula_247 is cyclic for prime formula_223: for example, if , formula_232 is a generator since , , , and .

Some cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements. In these groups, for every non-zero element , all the powers of formula_2 are distinct; despite the name &quot;cyclic group&quot;, the powers of the elements do not cycle. An infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to , the group of integers under addition introduced above. As these two prototypes are both abelian, so are all cyclic groups.

The study of finitely generated abelian groups is quite mature, including the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups; and reflecting this state of affairs, many group-related notions, such as center and commutator, describe the extent to which a given group is not abelian.

=== Symmetry groups ===


&quot;Symmetry groups&quot; are groups consisting of symmetries of given mathematical objects, principally geometric entities, such as the symmetry group of the square given as an introductory example above, although they also arise in algebra such as the symmetries among the roots of polynomial equations dealt with in Galois theory (see below). Conceptually, group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object if every group element can be associated to some operation on and the composition of these operations follows the group law. For example, an element of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on a triangular tiling of the hyperbolic plane by permuting the triangles. By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.

In chemistry, point groups describe molecular symmetries, while space groups describe crystal symmetries in crystallography. These symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of quantum mechanical analysis of these properties. For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because of the symmetry of the states involved.

Group theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.

Such spontaneous symmetry breaking has found further application in elementary particle physics, where its occurrence is related to the appearance of Goldstone bosons.

Finite symmetry groups such as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory, which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in CD players. Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved. Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in (geometric) invariant theory.

=== General linear group and representation theory ===
Matrix groups consist of matrices together with matrix multiplication. The &quot;general linear group&quot; formula_251 consists of all invertible -by- matrices with real entries. Its subgroups are referred to as &quot;matrix groups&quot; or &quot;linear groups&quot;. The dihedral group example mentioned above can be viewed as a (very small) matrix group. Another important matrix group is the special orthogonal group . It describes all possible rotations in formula_206 dimensions. Rotation matrices in this group are used in computer graphics.

&quot;Representation theory&quot; is both an application of the group concept and important for a deeper understanding of groups. It studies the group by its group actions on other spaces. A broad class of group representations are linear representations in which the group acts on a vector space, such as the three-dimensional Euclidean space . A representation of a group formula_17 on an formula_206-dimensional real vector space is simply a group homomorphism
formula_255
from the group to the general linear group. This way, the group operation, which may be abstractly given, translates to the multiplication of matrices making it accessible to explicit computations.

A group action gives further means to study the object being acted on. On the other hand, it also yields information about the group. Group representations are an organizing principle in the theory of finite groups, Lie groups, algebraic groups and topological groups, especially (locally) compact groups.

=== Galois groups ===

&quot;Galois groups&quot; were developed to help solve polynomial equations by capturing their symmetry features. For example, the solutions of the quadratic equation formula_256 are given by
formula_257
Each solution can be obtained by replacing the formula_258 sign by formula_4 or formula_260; analogous formulae are known for cubic and quartic equations, but do &quot;not&quot; exist in general for degree 5 and higher. In the quadratic formula, changing the sign (permuting the resulting two solutions) can be viewed as a (very simple) group operation. Analogous Galois groups act on the solutions of higher-degree polynomial equations and are closely related to the existence of formulas for their solution. Abstract properties of these groups (in particular their solvability) give a criterion for the ability to express the solutions of these polynomials using solely addition, multiplication, and roots similar to the formula above.

Modern Galois theory generalizes the above type of Galois groups by shifting to field theory and considering field extensions formed as the splitting field of a polynomial. This theory establishes—via the fundamental theorem of Galois theory—a precise relationship between fields and groups, underlining once again the ubiquity of groups in mathematics.

== Finite groups ==

A group is called &quot;finite&quot; if it has a finite number of elements. The number of elements is called the order of the group. An important class is the &quot;symmetric groups&quot; , the groups of permutations of formula_161 objects. For example, the symmetric group on 3 letters formula_262 is the group of all possible reorderings of the objects. The three letters ABC can be reordered into ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA, forming in total 6 (factorial of 3) elements. The group operation is composition of these reorderings, and the identity element is the reordering operation that leaves the order unchanged. This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group formula_263 for a suitable integer , according to Cayley&#x27;s theorem. Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above, formula_262 can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle.

The order of an element formula_2 in a group formula_17 is the least positive integer formula_206 such that , where formula_268 represents
formula_269
that is, application of the operation &quot; to formula_206 copies of . (If &quot; represents multiplication, then formula_268 corresponds to the th power of .) In infinite groups, such an formula_206 may not exist, in which case the order of formula_2 is said to be infinity. The order of an element equals the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by this element.

More sophisticated counting techniques, for example, counting cosets, yield more precise statements about finite groups: Lagrange&#x27;s Theorem states that for a finite group formula_17 the order of any finite subgroup formula_123 divides the order of . The Sylow theorems give a partial converse.

The dihedral group formula_70 of symmetries of a square is a finite group of order 8. In this group, the order of formula_49 is 4, as is the order of the subgroup formula_154 that this element generates. The order of the reflection elements formula_144 etc. is 2. Both orders divide 8, as predicted by Lagrange&#x27;s theorem. The groups formula_247 of multiplication modulo a prime formula_223 have order .

=== Finite abelian groups ===
Any finite abelian group is isomorphic to a product of finite cyclic groups; this statement is part of the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups.

Any group of prime order formula_223 is isomorphic to the cyclic group formula_283 (a consequence of Lagrange&#x27;s theorem). 
Any group of order formula_284 is abelian, isomorphic to formula_285 or .
But there exist nonabelian groups of order formula_286; the dihedral group formula_70 of order formula_288 above is an example.

=== Simple groups ===
When a group formula_17 has a normal subgroup formula_161 other than formula_291 and formula_17 itself, questions about formula_17 can sometimes be reduced to questions about formula_161 and . A nontrivial group is called &quot;simple&quot; if it has no such normal subgroup. Finite simple groups are to finite groups as prime numbers are to positive integers: they serve as building blocks, in a sense made precise by the Jordan–Hölder theorem.

=== Classification of finite simple groups ===
Computer algebra systems have been used to list all groups of order up to 2000.
But classifying all finite groups is a problem considered too hard to be solved.

The classification of all finite &quot;simple&quot; groups was a major achievement in contemporary group theory. There are several infinite families of such groups, as well as 26 &quot;sporadic groups&quot; that do not belong to any of the families. The largest sporadic group is called the monster group. The monstrous moonshine conjectures, proved by Richard Borcherds, relate the monster group to certain modular functions.

The gap between the classification of simple groups and the classification of all groups lies in the extension problem.

== Groups with additional structure ==
An equivalent definition of group consists of replacing the &quot;there exist&quot; part of the group axioms by operations whose result is the element that must exist. So, a group is a set formula_17 equipped with a binary operation formula_296 (the group operation), a unary operation formula_297 (which provides the inverse) and a nullary operation, which has no operand and results in the identity element. Otherwise, the group axioms are exactly the same. This variant of the definition avoids existential quantifiers and is used in computing with groups and for computer-aided proofs.

This way of defining groups lends itself to generalizations such as the notion of group object in a category. Briefly, this is an object with morphisms that mimic the group axioms.

=== Topological groups ===
Some topological spaces may be endowed with a group law. In order for the group law and the topology to interweave well, the group operations must be continuous functions; informally, formula_298 and formula_299 must not vary wildly if formula_118 and formula_121 vary only a little. Such groups are called &quot;topological groups,&quot; and they are the group objects in the category of topological spaces. The most basic examples are the group of real numbers under addition and the group of nonzero real numbers under multiplication. Similar examples can be formed from any other topological field, such as the field of complex numbers or the field of -adic numbers. These examples are locally compact, so they have Haar measures and can be studied via harmonic analysis. Other locally compact topological groups include the group of points of an algebraic group over a local field or adele ring; these are basic to number theory Galois groups of infinite algebraic field extensions are equipped with the Krull topology, which plays a role in infinite Galois theory. A generalization used in algebraic geometry is the étale fundamental group.

=== Lie groups ===

A &quot;Lie group&quot; is a group that also has the structure of a differentiable manifold; informally, this means that it looks locally like a Euclidean space of some fixed dimension. Again, the definition requires the additional structure, here the manifold structure, to be compatible: the multiplication and inverse maps are required to be smooth.

A standard example is the general linear group introduced above: it is an open subset of the space of all formula_206-by-formula_206 matrices, because it is given by the inequality
formula_304
where formula_305 denotes an formula_206-by-formula_206 matrix.

Lie groups are of fundamental importance in modern physics: Noether&#x27;s theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, as well as translations in space and time, are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example is the group of Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of spacetime in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory. An important example of a gauge theory is the Standard Model, which describes three of the four known fundamental forces and classifies all known elementary particles.

== Generalizations ==

More general structures may be defined by relaxing some of the axioms defining a group. The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups.

For example, if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated, the resulting algebraic structure is called a monoid. The natural numbers formula_308 (including zero) under addition form a monoid, as do the nonzero integers under multiplication . Adjoining inverses of all elements of the monoid formula_309 produces a group , and likewise adjoining inverses to any (abelian) monoid produces a group known as the Grothendieck group of .

A group can be thought of as a small category with one object in which every morphism is an isomorphism: given such a category, the set formula_310 is a group; conversely, given a group , one can build a small category with one object in which .
More generally, a groupoid is any small category in which every morphism is an isomorphism.
In a groupoid, the set of all morphisms in the category is usually not a group, because the composition is only partially defined: is defined only when the source of matches the target of .
Groupoids arise in topology (for instance, the fundamental groupoid) and in the theory of stacks.

Finally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an -ary operation (i.e., an operation taking arguments, for some nonnegative integer ). With the proper generalization of the group axioms, this gives a notion of -ary group.

<doc id="19448" wikidata="Q485893" url="?curid=19448" title="Marilyn Manson (band)">
<text>Marilyn Manson is an American rock band formed by namesake lead singer Marilyn Manson and guitarist Daisy Berkowitz in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1989. Originally named Marilyn Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids, they gained a local cult following in South Florida in the early 1990s with their theatrical live performances. In 1993, they were the first act signed to Trent Reznor&#x27;s Nothing Records label. Until 1996, the name of each member was created by combining the first name of a female sex symbol and the last name of a male serial for example, Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson. Their lineup has changed between many of their album releases; the eponymous lead singer is the only remaining original member.

In the past, band members dressed in outlandish makeup and costumes, and engaged in intentionally shocking behavior both onstage and off. Their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs, while their live performances were frequently called offensive and obscene. On several occasions, protests and petitions led to the group being blocked from performing, with at least three US states passing legislation banning the group from performing at state-owned venues. They released a number of platinum-selling albums, including &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; (1996) and &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; (1998). These albums, along with their highly stylized music videos and worldwide touring, brought public recognition to Marilyn Manson. In 1999, news media, infamously, falsely blamed the band for influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre.

As this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band&#x27;s mainstream popularity. Despite this, Jon Wiederhorn of MTV, in June 2003, referred to Marilyn Manson as &quot;the only true artist today&quot;. Marilyn Manson is widely regarded as being one of the most iconic and controversial figures in rock music, with the band and its lead singer influencing numerous other groups and musicians, both in metal-associated acts and also in wider popular culture. VH1 ranked Marilyn Manson as the seventy-eighth best rock band on their &quot;100 Great Artists of Hard Rock&quot;. They were inducted into the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Hall of Fame in 2000 and have been nominated for four Grammy Awards. In the U.S., the band has seen ten of its releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. Marilyn Manson have sold in excess of 50 million records worldwide.
==History==
===Formation and The Spooky Kids (1989–1992)===
In 1989, Brian Warner was a college student working towards a degree in journalism at Broward College, gaining experience by writing music articles for the South Florida lifestyle magazine &quot;25th Parallel&quot;. It was in this capacity that he met several of the musicians to whom his own band would later be compared, including My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. That December, he met Scott Putesky, who proposed the two form a band, after reading some lyrics and poems written by Warner. Warner, guitarist Putesky and bassist Brian Tutunick recorded their first demo tape as Marilyn Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids in 1990, taking on the stage names of Marilyn Manson, Daisy Berkowitz and Olivia Newton Bundy, respectively. Bundy left the band soon after, and was replaced by Gidget Gein, born Brad Stewart. They were later joined on keyboard by Stephen Bier, who called himself Madonna Wayne Gacy. In 1991, drummer Fred Streithorst joined the band under the name Sara Lee Lucas.

The stage names adopted by each member were representative of a concept the band considered central: the dichotomy of good and evil, and the existence of both, together, in every whole. &quot;Marilyn Monroe had a dark side&quot;, explained Manson in his autobiography, &quot;just as Charles Manson has a good, intelligent side.&quot; Over the next six years, all of the band&#x27;s members would adopt names that combined the first name of a female sex symbol and the surname of a serial killer. Images of both Monroe and Manson, as well as of other famous and infamous figures, were common in the band&#x27;s early promotional materials.

The Spooky Kids&#x27; popularity in the area grew quickly and because of the band&#x27;s highly visual concerts, which drew from performance art and used many shock techniques such as &quot;naked women nailed to a cross, a child in a cage, or bloody animal body parts.&quot; Band members variously performed in women&#x27;s clothing or bizarre costumes; and, for lack of a professional pyrotechnician, would set their own stage props on fire. The band would contrast these theatrics with elements drawn from their youth: characters from 1970s and &#x27;80s children&#x27;s television made regular, often grotesquely altered, appearances on band flyers and newsletters, and were frequently sampled in their music. They continued to perform and release cassettes – shortening their name to Marilyn Manson in 1992 – until the summer of 1993, when they drew the attention of Reznor, who had just founded his own label, Nothing Records.

===&quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; and &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; (1993–1995)===

Reznor offered the band a contract with the label, as well as an opening slot supporting Nine Inch Nails on their upcoming &quot;Self Destruct Tour&quot;. After accepting both offers, recording sessions for their debut studio album began in July 1993 with Swans producer Roli Mosimann at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. Recording a selection of new songs along with material from their Spooky Kids repertoire, the first version of their debut, titled &quot;The Manson Family Album&quot;, was completed by the end of the month. However, it was not well received. The band&#x27;s members, along with Reznor, criticized Mosimann&#x27;s production as being flat, lifeless and poorly representative of the band&#x27;s live performances. At the same time, Gidget Gein had begun to lose control of his addiction to heroin. Before reworking the album, the band played two shows in Florida under the name Mrs. Scabtree. This band featured Manson on drums, Gacy on keyboard, Berkowitz on guitar, and Jessicka from Jack Off Jill sharing vocal duties with Jeordie White of Coral Springs thrash band Amboog-a-Lard. Four other local musicians, bassists Mark Dubin of Sister Venus and Patrick Joyce from The Itch, guitarist Miles Hie and violinist Mary Karlzen were also involved.

Reznor agreed to rework production of &quot;The Manson Family Album&quot; in October 1993 at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Gein, who had been hospitalized after his fourth heroin overdose, was not invited to participate, and was fired from the band soon after, replaced by White, of Amboog-a-Lard, who undertook the alias Twiggy Ramirez. After seven weeks of mixing, re-recording and remixing, the album – now titled &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; – was presented to Nothing&#x27;s parent label Interscope. The album was released on July 19, 1994, and peaked at number thirty-five on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers album chart. The band began its first national headlining tour in December 1994, with Jack Off Jill opening. During the band&#x27;s stint as opening act on the Nine Inch Nails tour, Manson met Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey. LaVey bestowed the title of &quot;Reverend&quot; on Manson– meaning a person who is revered by the church, and not necessarily one who dedicates their life to preaching the religion to others, as with a priest or minister. Manson would use this title in the liner notes of the band&#x27;s following album, citing himself as &quot;Reverend Marilyn Manson&quot;.

In March 1995, the band began a two-month tour, this time with Monster Voodoo Machine as support. This would be drummer Sara Lee Lucas&#x27;s last tour with the band. Kenneth Wilson, better known by his stage name Ginger Fish, then joined the group before they embarked on a tour with rock band Danzig and metal band Korn. The band then relocated to the new home of Nothing Studios in New Orleans to begin work on remixes and b-sides for &quot;Portrait&quot;″s third single, &quot;Dope Hat&quot;, releasing a music video inspired by the boat ride scene from the 1971 movie &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;. The proposed single eventually developed into &quot;Smells Like Children&quot;, which included the band&#x27;s version of the Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;, their first hit; the song&#x27;s music video was placed in heavy rotation on MTV, in stark contrast with the &quot;Dope Hat&quot; video, which the same channel had banished to late-night airplay only a few months prior.

===&quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; (1996–1997)===

The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, was released on October 8, 1996. It was recorded at Nothing Studios with Reznor, Manson, Sean Beavan and former Skinny Puppy member and longtime producer Dave Ogilvie sharing co-production duties; members of both Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails took part in its recording. The process of making the album was a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments involving sleep deprivation and near-constant drug use, in an effort to create a violent and hostile environment suited to the album&#x27;s content. During this time, antagonism between band members was high. Daisy Berkowitz, the band&#x27;s founding guitarist, departed the band partway through the album&#x27;s recording process, with Twiggy performing much of the album&#x27;s guitar work. Timothy Linton responded to an advert seeking Berkowitz&#x27;s replacement. He would form a close relationship with Madonna Wayne Gacy, who was responsible for the inclusion of one of the major sources of inspiration for the album: Kabbalah. Breaking with the six-year tradition of naming band members after female icons and serial killers, Zim Zum was chosen as Linton&#x27;s stage name. It was derived from the Lurianic Kabbalah concept of Tzimtzum. &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single. It created enough anticipation for &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; that the album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 132,000 copies. Manson also appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who awarded the band their &#x27;Best New Artist&#x27; accolade in 1997. The year-long &quot;Dead to the World Tour&quot; followed, which was the band&#x27;s longest and widest-ranging tour yet. In the US, however, the band was receiving more attention than ever before, and not all of it was positive. As the tour was getting underway, the band found itself the target of bipartisan congressional hearings, led by conservative violent entertainment watchdog group Empower America (now known as FreedomWorks) co-directors Republican Secretary of Education William Bennett and Democratic U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman, to determine the effects, if any, of violent lyrics on young listeners. In addition, nearly every performance of the tour was picketed by religious organizations.

In July 1997, Manson collaborated with British trip hop group Sneaker Pimps for the single &quot;Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot; from the soundtrack to the 1997 film &quot;Spawn&quot;. The band released their second EP, &quot;Remix &amp; Repent&quot;, on November 25, 1997. It featured new versions of &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;&#x27;s four singles: &quot;The Beautiful People&quot;, &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; and &quot;Man That You Fear&quot;. In February 1998, Manson released his autobiography, &quot;The Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot;, as well as a live video entitled &quot;Dead to the World&quot;. It was also confirmed that &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; would be the first installment in a concept album trilogy which the band called their triptych.

===&quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; (1998–1999)===

The band released the second part of their triptych, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;, on September 15, 1998. Co-produced by the band&#x27;s lead singer with Sean Beavan and Michael Beinhorn, the album moved away from the industrial rock production of its predecessor and was strongly influenced by 1970s glam rock, particularly David Bowie&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;. Billy Corgan served as an unofficial consultant to the band during the early development of the album. After playing a few songs for him, Corgan advised them that &quot;This is definitely the right direction&quot; but to &quot;go all the way with it. Don&#x27;t just hint at it&quot;, referring to its inclusion of glam influences. To suit their new musical style, the band also recast itself as a glam rock outfit, setting aside the &quot;rotting-corpse chic&quot; of the previous era in favor of attire more suited to the genre, incorporating leather, platform boots and brightly dyed hair. The band also relocated from New Orleans to Los Angeles, while Zim Zum was replaced by guitarist John Lowery of 2wo, whose stage name, John 5, was given to him by Manson during their first lunch meeting.

Interscope&#x27;s promotion of the album was massive, with the label erecting enormous billboards of the lead singer as an androgynous extraterrestrial in both Times Square and Sunset Strip. Repeated appearances on MTV and other networks helped propel the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, to number twelve on Billboard&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting single yet. The song&#x27;s music video was critically acclaimed, winning two awards at the 1998 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Video Awards as well as the Best Cinematography award at the 1999 MTV VMA&#x27;s; while the song was also nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. The album would go on to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first week sales of over 223,000.

After a brief promotional campaign, the band set out on the &quot;Beautiful Monsters Tour&quot; with Hole. The tour would be a problematic one, and was marred by frequent on–and–off stage exchanges between Manson and Hole vocalist Courtney Love. Private disputes also arose over the tour&#x27;s financial arrangements, with Hole unwittingly financing most of Manson&#x27;s production costs, which were disproportionately high relative to Hole&#x27;s. The tour was to include thirty-seven shows spanning over a two-month period, although Hole left after taking part in just nine of the scheduled dates. A broken ankle from Manson also forced the postponement of the next two shows, with the remainder of the tour being renamed &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot; and Jack Off Jill and Nashville Pussy taking over select opening slots.

The final four dates of the tour were canceled out of respect for the victims of the Columbine High School massacre. The latter half of 1999 and much of 2000 was a period of relative silence for the band, who refused to take part in interviews and retreated from public life. They shelved plans for a proposed single and music video for their cover of AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;. They spent this period writing and recording in a secluded studio in Death Valley, with only the live album &quot;The Last Tour on Earth&quot; appearing during this time. A studio outtake from &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, titled &quot;Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes&quot;, served as its only single.

===&quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot; (2000–2001)===

&quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot; was released on November 11, 2000. Produced by the band&#x27;s lead singer with Dave Sardy, the album also features programming and pre-production editing by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb. The band wrote over 100 songs for the album, which was a return to the darker, more abrasive sound of &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;. Much of its content was written in response to the Columbine massacre, with the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;The Nobodies&quot;, directly referring to the shootings. Described by the band&#x27;s frontman as the third part of a trilogy which began with &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; and continued in &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;, its overarching theme is an exploration of the relationship between death and fame in American culture, and its lyrics and artwork contain many references to John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald, John Lennon and Mark David Chapman, and Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. The &quot;Guns, God and Government Tour&quot; elaborated on &quot;Holy Wood&quot;&#x27;s central theme, and with its logo – a rifle and handguns arranged to resemble the Christian cross – Manson made no attempt to conceal what he saw as the source of that fascination.

The band also revealed that within their concept album trilogy, &quot;Holy Wood&quot; serves as prequel to &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; and &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; despite the latter two preceding &quot;Holy Wood&quot; in release date. Each album contains its own distinct storyline, which can be linked together to create a larger overarching storyline encompassing all three. Manson has offered this much in the way of an interpretation: &quot;[&quot;Holy Wood&quot; is about] wanting to fit into a world that didn&#x27;t want me, and fighting really hard to get there. [The album&#x27;s deepest elements] are idealism and the desire to start a revolution. If you begin with &quot;Holy Wood&quot;, then &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; really talks about how that revolution gets taken away from you and turned into a product, and then &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; is where you&#x27;re given a choice to decide if you&#x27;re going to be controlled by the power that you created or if you want to destroy yourself and then start over. It just becomes a cycle.&quot;

The band initially declined to join the 2001 lineup of Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s Ozzfest, as its June 21 date in Denver would mark their first appearance in Colorado since the Columbine massacre. After the band announced on their website that they would perform in Denver, they were protested by religious groups. The band planned to &quot;balance out&quot; their &quot;violent lyrics&quot; by quoting biblical texts, &quot;so we can examine the virtues of wonderful Christian stories of disease, murder, adultery, suicide and child sacrifice.&quot; The tour was documented by a DVD of the same name, which was released on October 29, 2002. In addition to a compilation style concert [songs from multiple individual shows edited together to appear as a single performance], it includes a thirty-minute short film titled &quot;The Death Parade&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Guns, God and Government – Live in LA&quot; in 2009, which depicts their performance of January 13, 2001, at Los Angeles&#x27;s Grand Olympic Auditorium in its entirety.

Earlier in 2001, the band released a cover of Gloria Jones&#x27;s &quot;Tainted Love&quot; on the soundtrack to &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;. The song became the band&#x27;s biggest international hit yet, peaking at number one in numerous European territories. In 2002, Jonathan Davis of Korn invited Marilyn Manson to record vocals on a track titled &quot;Redeemer&quot;, which was released on his soundtrack to &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;. Manson also appeared in Michael Moore&#x27;s 2002 documentary, &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;; his appearance was filmed on the same day as their Denver Ozzfest performance. When Moore asked what Manson would have said to the students at Columbine, he replied, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say a single word to them. I would listen to what they have to say, and that&#x27;s what no one did.&quot;

===&quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot; and &quot;Lest We Forget&quot; (2002–2006)===
With the &quot;triptych&quot; of previous albums complete, the band was free to begin a fresh project. In 2002, Manson created an original score for the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film with former KMFDM multi-instrumentalist Tim Skold. Soon after, Skold became an official band member when Twiggy Ramirez amicably left the group, citing creative differences. After finding inspiration through Manson&#x27;s girlfriend Dita Von Teese in the swing and burlesque movements of 1920s Berlin, the band recorded &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot;, which was released on May 13, 2003, and debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, selling over 118,000 copies on its first week. It was also an international success, particularly in Europe, where it sold over 400,000 copies on its first week, and topping various national record charts, as well as &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s European Albums Chart. The album also appeared on several critics&#x27; year-end lists, and won a 2003 Metal Edge Readers&#x27; Choice Award for &quot;Album of the Year&quot;.

Eschewing the lyrical depth and symbolism found on &quot;Holy Wood&quot;, the album was relatively straightforward: in an extended metaphor, Manson compares his own often-criticized work to the &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot; banned by the Nazi regime. Lyrically, Manson utilizes the narrative mode of stream of consciousness throughout the album to examine the human psyche in times of crisis, specifically focusing on the mindset of lunatics and children, as, according to Manson, &quot;they don&#x27;t follow the rules [of society].&quot; Several songs incorporate elements commonly found in playground chants and nursery rhymes, which Manson would &quot;pervert into something ugly and lurid.&quot; The work of Kurt Weill was also noted as an influence, along with the lucid dreams the singer was having during its production, with Manson explaining that he would &quot;wake up and say, &#x27;I want to write a song that sounds like a stampeding elephant,&#x27; or &#x27;I want to write a song that sounds like a burning piano.&#x27;&quot;

Manson began his long-term collaboration with Austrian-Irish artist Gottfried Helnwein, working together on several multi-media projects associated with the album, including the exhibitions and installation art projects featured at the album&#x27;s launch party at The Key Club in Los Angeles, the album artwork, the music video to lead single &quot;mOBSCENE&quot;, as well as the artwork which accompanied Manson&#x27;s essay for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Limited edition copies of the album included a DVD titled &quot;Doppelherz&quot; (Double-heart), a 25-minute surrealist short film directed by Manson which featured art direction by Helnwein. Another world tour followed, &quot;Grotesk Burlesk&quot;, which furthered the album&#x27;s Weimar Republic-inspired theme by adding Helnwein-created stage dressing and elements of German &quot;Kabarett&quot; to the group&#x27;s performances. Manson and the band members began appearing both on-and off-stage in designer suits created by Jean-Paul Gaultier.

&quot;Lest We Forget: The Best Of&quot; was released on September 28, 2004, and was referred to by Manson as a &quot;farewell&quot; compilation. It was the last album released under Nothing Records, as the label was dissolved following a lawsuit filed by Reznor against his former manager and business partner, John Malm. The compilation was supported by the &quot;Against All Gods Tour&quot;, as well as a single–a cover of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;. It was the first and only tour to feature Mark Chaussee of Rob Halford&#x27;s Fight on lead guitar, replacing John 5, whose relationship with Manson had soured over the previous year. Former Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna also replaced Ginger Fish, who fractured his wrist, skull and cheekbone after falling several feet off his drum riser during a performance at a German awards ceremony.

===&quot;Eat Me, Drink Me&quot; (2007–2008)===

By late 2005, the band had composed 18 new songs, but work on their sixth studio album was halted when Manson focused his attention on various film and art projects, including the development of his screenplay, &quot;&quot;, as well as a minor role in the Lucy Liu movie &quot;&quot;. He also launched a self-proclaimed art movement, the Celebritarian Corporation, which included artist Gottfried Helnwein, fashion designer Steven Klein and director Anthony Silva, as well as announcing plans to open an art gallery and publish a book of his paintings. It was after opening the Celebritarian Corporation Gallery Of Fine Art on Melrose Avenue in 2006 that work started on new material, with Manson writing lyrics over Skold&#x27;s already existing compositions.

The resulting material was composed and recorded entirely by Skold, and does not feature writing or performance contributions from any other member of the band. Its content is largely inspired by personal troubles relating to Manson&#x27;s failed marriage to Von Teese, and his burgeoning relationship with then-19-year old actress Evan Rachel Wood. The band made their debut appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on October 31, 2006, performing their cover of &quot;This Is Halloween&quot; from a deluxe edition re-release of &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; soundtrack. This would be their last performance featuring longtime keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy, who would go on to file a $20m lawsuit against the band the following year for unpaid &quot;partnership proceeds&quot;.

The album was preceded by the release of a single, &quot;Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)&quot;, whose music video was shot using director James Cameron&#x27;s 3D Fusion Camera System technology. The video caused controversy upon release, with several sources claiming that it featured genuine footage of Manson and Wood engaged in sexual intercourse. Wood was reportedly paid &quot;the highest [music] video salary in history&quot; to appear in the video. &quot;Eat Me, Drink Me&quot; was released on June 5, 2007, and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number eight with first week sales of 88,000 copies. It also peaked in the top ten of most major international album charts, as well as at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s European Albums Chart. &quot;Putting Holes in Happiness&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single.

To promote the album, the band embarked on the nine-month &quot;Rape of the World Tour&quot;, which featured Skold on lead guitar, former The Prodigy bassist Rob Holliday and longtime drummer Ginger Fish; while Vrenna rejoined the band as their live keyboardist. The first leg of the tour was a co-headlining set with American thrash metal band Slayer, with support coming from Bleeding Through. In November 2007, Manson confirmed that he and Skold had begun work on the band&#x27;s next studio album, with Slayer&#x27;s Kerry King, former The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha and Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs set to feature. By the beginning of 2008, however, Twiggy Ramirez had rejoined the band as bassist, resulting in the exit of Skold, with Holliday moving from bass to lead guitar for the remaining duration of the tour. Future collaborations with Skold were not ruled out.

===&quot;The High End of Low&quot; (2009–2010)===
In 2008, former Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland joined the band for their headlining show at the 2008 ETP Fest in South Korea. However, Borland left the group to reunite with Limp Bizkit, later saying that he was reluctant to be a &quot;hired gun&quot;, citing the band&#x27;s refusal to record any of the nine songs he submitted for their upcoming album. R&amp;B singer Ne-Yo claimed in early December that he would hold writing sessions with the band&#x27;s frontman on new material, although Manson denied it, saying that he had &quot;never even met Ne-Yo. I can assure him that he would not want to be associated with something this godless.&quot;

&quot;The High End of Low&quot; was recorded throughout 2008, with Manson recording vocals at his Hollywood Hills home studio between November and January 5, 2009. Produced by Manson, Twiggy and Vrenna with &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; and &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; co-producer Sean Beavan, Manson described the album as containing &quot;extreme&quot; autobiographical content relating to the dissolution of his engagement to Wood, and as being &quot;very ruthless, heavy and violent&quot;. Its fifteen songs appear on the album in the order they were written. The penultimate track, &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, portrays the vocalist&#x27;s mental state on Christmas Day, wherein he attempted to contact Wood 158 times, cutting himself with a razorblade on the face or hands for each corresponding attempt. The album&#x27;s final song, &quot;15&quot;, was completed on Manson&#x27;s January 5 birthday – hence the name. Manson utilized his entire home as a canvas to document the disintegration of the relationship, writing its lyrics on walls and coupling them with paintings and drawings relating to Wood, as well as used condoms, bags of cocaine and other drug paraphernalia.
&quot;We&#x27;re from America&quot; was released as a free download on the band&#x27;s website on March 27, 2009, while a Hot Topic-exclusive CD single followed two weeks later. After playing an instrumental version of &quot;Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon&quot; to Interscope&#x27;s A&amp;R department, it was chosen as the album&#x27;s official lead single, with an employee telling Manson, &quot;This is gonna be a hit!&quot;. Manson then quipped to the employee, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m glad that you have no consideration for what I [might] put on top of it.&quot; A heavily censored version of the profanity-laced track – re-titled to &quot;Arma ... geddon&quot; – was serviced to radio from April 13, and peaked at number thirty-seven on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart, becoming their lowest-peaking single in the process. The album was released on May 20, 2009 and debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of over 49,000 copies, their lowest opening week figure since &quot;The Last Tour on Earth&quot; debuted with 26,000 copies in 1999.

Prior to &quot;The High End of Low&quot;&#x27;s release, Manson made a series of disparaging comments regarding Interscope and its artistic censorship; as well as its then-CEO Jimmy Iovine, who Manson said &quot;wasn&#x27;t smart enough to understand what [we] do&quot;, and publicly claiming that the label &quot;cares more about Vitamin Water [the private equity venture of Interscope-signed 50 Cent] than music.&quot; Reznor – who, as of 2015, remains friends with Iovine – responded by calling Manson a &quot;dopey clown&quot; and claiming that &quot;He is a malicious guy and will step on anybody&#x27;s face to succeed and cross any line of decency.&quot; While promoting the album in the UK, Manson appeared inebriated in a series of interviews. An interview for &quot;Alan Carr: Chatty Man&quot; recorded during this time remains unaired, due to graphic language and content. A music video for &quot;Running to the Edge of the World&quot; – in which Manson beats a Wood lookalike to death – was released on November 4 and was condemned as a perceived glorification of violence against women. The band parted ways with Interscope on December 3. They settled the lawsuit filed by former keyboardist Stephen Bier (aka M.W. Gacy), with Manson&#x27;s insurance company paying Bier&#x27;s attorney&#x27;s fees and Bier receiving no monetary value.

===&quot;Born Villain&quot; (2011–2013)===
Upon parting with Interscope, Manson said &quot;a lot of the creative control on which my hands were tied [has been regained]&quot;, while stating that the band had been writing new material while touring their previous album. Manson attested that its lyrical content would be &quot;more romantic&quot; yet &quot;self-abusive&quot;, and described its sonic elements as being &quot;suicide death metal&quot;. Fred Sablan joined the band in July 2010. By October, Twiggy described the album as being &quot;almost done&quot;, and opined that &quot;It&#x27;s our best record yet. I mean, everyone always says that, but I think this is our best work so far. It&#x27;s kind of like a little more of a punk rock &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;, without sounding too pretentious.&quot; The following month, it was announced that the band had signed a joint-venture deal with London-based indie label Cooking Vinyl. As part of the deal, the band would retain creative control over their artistic direction, with the band and label sharing profits equally after the label recoups costs associated with marketing, promotion and distribution.

For much of 2011, Manson removed himself from the public spotlight and ceased almost all communication with fans, only taking a break from his self-imposed sequestration to appear in the music video for &quot;Tempat Ku&quot; by Brunei rock band D&#x27;Hask. On February 24, longtime drummer Ginger Fish announced his resignation from the group. On May 22, their website underwent a complete overhaul. A 26-second clip of an unreleased song, tentatively titled &quot;I am among no one&quot;, was uploaded to their Vimeo account, along with a new logo.

After being impressed by his directorial work on one of Kid Cudi&#x27;s music videos, Manson employed actor Shia LaBeouf to direct a short film entitled &quot;Born Villain&quot;. Contrary to media reports that the project would be a &quot;making-of&quot; video documenting the album&#x27;s recording, &quot;Born Villain&quot; was a surrealist short featuring a previously unreleased track, &quot;Overneath the Path of Misery&quot;. Containing numerous references to &quot;Macbeth&quot;, it was inspired by Jodorowsky&#x27;s &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; and Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí&#x27;s 1929 silent film &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot;. To promote the project, LaBeouf and his girlfriend, photographer Karolyn Pho, graffitied areas of LA with its artwork. LaBeouf and Pho later photographed their work, and released it as a limited edition book titled &quot;Campaign&quot;, which was bundled with a DVD of the film. In November, Vrenna departed the band to focus on other production work, whilst indicating that production of their eighth studio album was &quot;largely completed&quot;.

The album was preceded by the release of &quot;No Reflection&quot;, which Manson leaked to KROQ-FM on March 7, 2012. Cooking Vinyl CEO Martin Goldschmidt called the leak a &quot;masterstroke&quot;, saying &quot;we had all these exclusives lined up around the world, and then Manson blew them all. We&#x27;re already getting more radio play than the whole of the last record.&quot; The song went on to peak at number twenty-six on the Mainstream Rock chart, spending fourteen weeks on the chart, and was their best-performing single there since &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; in 2004. &quot;Born Villain&quot; was released worldwide from April 25, debuting at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and atop both the Independent Albums and Top Hard Rock Albums charts. The album spent two weeks at number one on the UK Rock Albums Chart. A remix EP for &quot;Slo-Mo-Tion&quot; followed on November 5. The band embarked on the seventeen-month &quot;Hey Cruel World... Tour&quot; from the end of April, which was interspersed by co-headlining tours with Rob Zombie (&quot;Twins of Evil&quot;) and Alice Cooper (&quot;Masters of Madness&quot;).

===&quot;The Pale Emperor&quot; (2014–2016)===
In August 2012, it was announced that Manson would play a fictionalized version of himself in a four-episode arc of the sixth season of TV series &quot;Californication&quot;. While filming its season finale at the Greek Theatre in LA, Manson met the series&#x27; composer, Tyler Bates, and the two discussed a potential collaboration. Manson confirmed that production started on new material by May 2013. Four months later, Sablan announced that he had left the group.

One track from the album, &quot;Cupid Carries a Gun&quot; was used as the opening theme to &quot;Salem&quot; from its second episode onwards, which premiered on US television on April 27. In October, a large portion of the album track &quot;Killing Strangers&quot; was predominantly featured in the Keanu Reeves movie &quot;John Wick&quot;. &quot;Third Day of a Seven Day Binge&quot; was released for free download on the band&#x27;s website on October 26, and served as the album&#x27;s first official single. The band performed several new songs live for the first time as they played a handful of concerts around southern California in October and early November. &quot;Deep Six&quot; was released on December 16, with a music video following three days later. It went on to peak at number eight on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart, making it the band&#x27;s highest-ever peaking single on &quot;Billboard&quot;. &quot;Cupid Carries a Gun&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third official single on January 8, 2015.

&quot;The Pale Emperor&quot; was released on January 15 in the US. It is dedicated to Manson&#x27;s mother, who died in May 2014 after an eight-year battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and dementia. It was both a critical and commercial success, debuting at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of over 51,000 copies, their largest opening-week figure since &quot;Eat Me, Drink Me&quot; in 2007. Numerous publications referred to it as the band&#x27;s best album in over a decade. It would go on to appear on several &#x27;best of 2015&#x27; lists, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; dubbing it the &#x27;best metal album&#x27; of 2015. Music videos for both &quot;The Mephistopheles of Los Angeles&quot; and &quot;Third Day of a Seven Day Binge&quot; were released in May and July, respectively.

The band embarked on the nearly-two year-long The Hell Not Hallelujah Tour in support of the album, which was interspersed by a co-headlining tour with The Smashing Pumpkins titled The End Times. In February 2016, Manson contributed vocals to a version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Cat People (Putting Out Fire)&quot; on &quot;Countach (For Giorgio)&quot;, a tribute album to Giorgio Moroder curated by Shooter Jennings. A 16-bit music video for the song was released five months later. Also in February, details were announced of another co-headlining tour, this time with Slipknot. The tour was scheduled to begin on June 9 in Salt Lake City and consist of thirty-four dates in Amphitheatres throughout North America, with support from Of Mice &amp; Men. However, the first twelve dates of the tour were postponed after an examination revealed that Corey Taylor had broken two vertebrae in his neck. The tour began on June 28 in Nashville, Tennessee, with the postponed shows rescheduled for August.

===&quot;Heaven Upside Down&quot; (2017–2018)===
While touring with The Smashing Pumpkins, Manson indicated a &quot;strong possibility&quot; of working with Corgan on new material, and also revealed plans to collaborate with Korn frontman Jonathan Davis on a &quot;Southern-sounding, acoustic&quot; project. Manson announced in an interview with KEGL in November that work had begun on the band&#x27;s tenth studio album, while also confirming that Twiggy, Bates and Sharone would all be involved in its recording. &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; was reissued on cassette exclusively in Europe as part of Record Store Day 2016. To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, Manson indicated that a special edition of &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; would be issued on October 20, although this failed to materialize. Among its bonus content would have been a previously unreleased film, created during the &quot;Dead to the World Tour&quot;.

On July 19, Manson announced that the band&#x27;s tenth studio album had the working title &quot;SAY10&quot;, and predicted a release date of Valentine&#x27;s Day 2017. In September, Manson confirmed that the band were &quot;putting the finishing touches&quot; on the album, and said: &quot;It&#x27;s not very much in any way like &quot;The Pale Emperor&quot;. It&#x27;s pretty violent in its nature for some reason, and it&#x27;s not emotional in the same way. It&#x27;s got a chip on its shoulder. I can&#x27;t wait for people to hear it. I think they&#x27;re going to be quite surprised.&quot; On November 8 – the day of the 2016 US presidential election – Manson released a teaser clip of a new music video created alongside &quot;Final Girl&quot; director Tyler Shields. It featured scenes of Manson brandishing a knife while standing over a decapitated corpse. According to &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;″s Marlow Stern, the decapitated figure is dressed to resemble Donald Trump. Manson would later say that the figure in the video &quot;wasn&#x27;t anyone except if you wanted it to be them.&quot;

The album was not released in February 2017, and instead a long series of cryptic videos were posted to Marilyn Manson&#x27;s personal Instagram account over the course of just under 2 months, before Manson revealed on May 9 that the album had been named &quot;Heaven Upside Down&quot;. The band began their Heaven Upside Down Tour on July 20, 2017, in Budapest. The first single from the album, &quot;We Know Where You Fucking Live&quot;, was released on September 11, with the album due to follow on October 6. A second single, &quot;Kill4Me&quot;, was released on September 20. The band&#x27;s founding guitarist, Daisy Berkowitz, died on October 22, 2017, at the age of 49; he had been diagnosed with Stage IV colorectal cancer in 2013. Two days later, Manson announced he had &quot;decided to part ways&quot; with bassist Twiggy, after a rape allegation was made against Twiggy by his former girlfriend, Jack Off Jill vocalist Jessicka; for the rest of the tour, Juan Alderete (formerly of Racer X and The Mars Volta) joined. In July 2018, Manson embarked on the Twins of Evil: The Second Coming Tour in the US with co-headliner Rob Zombie and special guest Deadly Apples.

===&quot;We Are Chaos&quot; (2019–2023)===
In March 2019, Manson announced that he was nearly finished recording his next studio album and that country musician Shooter Jennings was involved. Later that year, drummer Gil Sharone announced he was leaving the band to pursue &quot;other current and future projects&quot;, with former Black Flag drummer Brandon Pertzborn hired as his replacement. Manson also revealed that Bates is no longer involved with the group, and that the album would be produced by Jennings and feature contributions from his drummer Jamie Douglass. In July, Manson embarked on the Twins of Evil: Hell Never Dies Tour in the US and Canada with co-headliner Rob Zombie, followed by festivals and headline dates with support from Deadly Apples. The band released their cover of The Doors&#x27; &quot;The End&quot; on streaming music services in November, with a limited edition vinyl scheduled to be issued on March 6, 2020. The song was recorded for the soundtrack to the upcoming miniseries &quot;The Stand&quot;, based on Stephen King&#x27;s novel of the same name. Manson is set to appear in the miniseries. The band are set to appear as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne during his No More Tours II series, a North American tour beginning in May 2020. However the tour was eventually cancelled along with Manson&#x27;s performances after Ozzy Osbourne was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

On January 13, 2020, live bassist Juan Alderete (ex-Racer X) was involved in a bicycle accident which left him with a diffuse axonal injury, a type of traumatic brain injury. A GoFundMe page has been created to help cover the cost of his medical expenses. On April 29, Manson and Jennings confirmed they had finished work on the band&#x27;s eleventh studio album, with both calling it a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. On July 28, Manson announced that a new single titled &quot;We Are Chaos&quot; would be released the following day. The next day, the track was released alongside the announcement of the band&#x27;s upcoming eleventh studio album titled &quot;We Are Chaos&quot; set for release on September 11, 2020. At the same time, the band revealed the album cover and the track list. The album debuted at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it their tenth top ten release on the chart.

In February 2021, Loma Vista Recordings announced they would not promote or participate in the distribution of any future recordings released by the band, following former girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood and various other accusations that the band&#x27;s vocalist sexually and psychologically abused them. In November 2021, former band member Tim Skold announced he was again working on new material with Marilyn Manson. In May 2023, Brandon Pertzborn left Marilyn Manson to join The Offspring as their drummer. Also in May, Marilyn Manson became active again on social media, posting two new pictures and announcing that there&#x27;s &quot;something new for you to hear&quot;.

===&quot;One Assassination Under God – Chapter 1&quot; (2024–present)===
In March 2024, it was announced the band would embark on an arena and amphitheater tour of North America with Five Finger Death Punch. The tour began on August 2, and was interspersed with the band&#x27;s own headlining shows. The same day the tour began, the band released &quot;As Sick as the Secrets Within&quot;, their first new single in four years. This was followed two weeks later by another new song, &quot;Raise the Red Flag&quot;. Music videos were released for each song, which were both directed by Bill Yukich. &quot;Sacrilegious&quot; was released in September. The band&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;One Assassination Under God – Chapter 1&quot;, was released on November 22, 2024. They began their own headline tour of Europe in February 2025, with a U.S. tour scheduled to begin in May.

==Musical style==
Although the band&#x27;s music has often been labeled as shock rock by mainstream media, Manson disputes the use of the label, preferring instead to identify his band&#x27;s music as rock and roll. The band combined industrial, goth, shock rock and metal into a &quot;creative bricolage&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the band &quot;draws equally from schlock metal, progressive metal, new wave, goth rock, and industrial rock&quot;. AllMusic also described the band&#x27;s music as &quot;glam-influenced industrial metal&quot;.&quot;The Daily Texan&quot; wrote that the band &quot;originally found success during the rise and popularity of nu metal&quot;, however &quot;Manson distanced himself from that movement, preferring alternative metal anguish over cookie monster-sounding raps.&quot; According to &quot;The Evolution of Goth Culture&quot;, the goth subculture &quot;resisted this takeover of the goth name by Marilyn Manson and their fans&quot; initially, but the band&#x27;s music would eventually be identified as being goth rock and industrial metal, even though Manson himself has been reluctant to &quot;pigeonhole&quot; his band as goth or metal. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the band&#x27;s music as &quot;heavy, industrialized goth rock&quot;, while AllMusic contends that the band merely borrows from gothic rock&#x27;s imagery. &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; wrote that &quot;gothic darkness and industrial rock [pervades] all of&quot; the band&#x27;s music. &quot;Stereogum&quot; wrote that &quot;metal has never been an integral part of Manson’s sound&quot; and although the band utilizes &quot;varying degrees [of] gritty, distorted guitar&quot;, the magazine suggested that the core of their music was actually pop music.

From 1996 to his departure in 2002, Twiggy was their chief musical contributor, co-writing many of the band&#x27;s biggest hits with Manson during this period. Despite never receiving a writing credit, drummer Ginger Fish provided substantial pre-production assistance to both Manson and Twiggy while composing demos for &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;. His drums loops and sound effects would go on to be predominantly featured on several tracks, most notably &quot;The Beautiful People&quot;. John 5 and Tim Skold were also prevalent composers, while &quot;The Pale Emperor&quot; and &quot;Heaven Upside Down&quot; were composed entirely by Tyler Bates.

All of the band&#x27;s lyrics are written by Manson, whose songwriting style varies between albums. Utilizing aesthetics often found within spoken-word poetry, his writing features comedy, puns, and double entendres, and he makes frequent use of alliteration. The band&#x27;s witticisms often take the form of neologisms, delivered several at a time in rapid-fire succession. Lyrical content has emerged from a wide range of subjects, including love, sex and sexuality, sexual abuse, rape, consumerism, politics, revenge, suicide, capitalism, violence and mortality, as well as the Bible and Greek mythology.

Manson predominantly delivers lyrics in a melodic fashion, although he invariably enhances his vocal register by utilizing several extended vocal techniques, such as vocal fry, screaming, growling and crooning. His voice can emit five different tones simultaneously, which mixing engineer Robert Carranza discovered can form a pentagram when imported into a phrasal analyzer. He possesses a baritone vocal type. His lowest bass note of A1 can be heard in &quot;Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon&quot;, while his highest note, an E6 – the first note of the whistle register – can be heard on the &quot;Born Villain&quot; song &quot;Hey, Cruel World ...&quot;.

==Influences==

Manson&#x27;s earliest musical memory was listening to Kiss during a family road trip; he has since cited the band as a major influence. As a child, he would imitate Kiss&#x27;s &quot;kabuki&quot;-like makeup and draw pictures of Gene Simmons and Peter Criss. The earliest incarnation of the band was conceived by Manson at a Fort Lauderdale nightclub called The Reunion Room in December 1989, where he was introduced to Big Black&#x27;s &quot;Songs About Fucking&quot; by his future keyboardist, Stephen Bier. Daisy Berkowitz played in several punk rock outfits before co-founding the Spooky Kids, and was influenced by acts such as the New York Dolls and the Jim Carroll Band, whose &quot;People Who Died&quot; was covered regularly at live shows.

As its only permanent member, Manson heads the direction of the band&#x27;s sound; he has been influenced by the shock rock of artists such as Arthur Brown, Alice Cooper, The Doors, Ozzy Osbourne and Iggy Pop. His biggest influence, however, was David Bowie, whom he credited with &quot;changing [his] life forever&quot;. The two have often been compared by mainstream media, particularly in relation to their ability to shift genre and style – replete with a new look and musical philosophy – with each studio release. Manson&#x27;s two favorite songs are Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Quicksand&quot; and &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;. For several years, Manson sang Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Cat People (Putting Out Fire)&quot; as a vocal warm up exercise before live performances; he later covered the song with musician Shooter Jennings.

During their period at Nothing Records, the band&#x27;s sound gathered sonic elements from other outfits on that label&#x27;s roster, particularly Nine Inch Nails, with Reznor co-producing their first two studio albums. Manson has cited Queen as an influence on the band&#x27;s more melodic work, while new wave and synthpop acts such as Depeche Mode and Gary Numan have been noted as influencing their electronic material. Manson said of the latter, &quot;I was always into his apocalyptic fiction lyrics. He pioneered electronic dance music.&quot; The work of gothic rock acts such as The Cure and Bauhaus has also been cited, with Twiggy saying that &quot;as far as guitar and bass combinations go&quot;, Bauhaus&#x27;s Daniel Ash and David J were &quot;a really big influence&quot;. Manson&#x27;s other influences include The Beatles, Rihanna, Madonna, Prince, White Zombie, Johnny Cash, Jimi Hendrix, N.W.A, The Smashing Pumpkins, Justin Timberlake, Ministry, Led Zeppelin, the occult, horror comics, and the King James Bible.

==Impact and legacy==

Marilyn Manson have been credited with creating some of the most recognizable and visually defining music videos of the MTV Generation, with some commentators suggesting that their music videos played a significant role in the band&#x27;s commercial success. Their work frequently incorporates surrealist iconography and purposefully grotesque imagery, and their style has been emulated by other performers. Joseph Schafer of &quot;Stereogum&quot; said in 2015 that &quot;perhaps no single artist has mastered the music video as a medium so well [as Marilyn Manson].&quot; They have received numerous awards and accolades for their work. Three of their videos – &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;, &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; and &quot;The Dope Show&quot; – received a total of five MTV Video Music Award nominations, with the latter winning the Award for Best Cinematography at the 1999 ceremony. The clip for &quot;The Dope Show&quot; also won two awards at the 1998 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Video Awards. &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; appeared at number fifty-four on MTV&#x27;s list of the &#x27;100 Greatest Music Videos Ever Made&#x27;. as well as at number one-hundred on MuchMusic&#x27;s 100 Greatest Videos Ever. Their 2003 video for &quot;(s)AINT&quot; was referred to by &quot;NME&quot; as &quot;one of the most explicit music videos ever made&quot;, and was included in lists of the &#x27;Most Controversial Music Videos&#x27; by both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;SF Weekly&quot;.

The band have received several Kerrang! Awards throughout their career, and were inducted into the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Hall of Fame in 2000. Manson also received their Icon Award in 2005, as well as their Lifetime Achievement Award ten years later. The publication has ranked &quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot; as the eleventh greatest rock album of the 2000s, and in 2015 they listed Manson as the twenty-eighth greatest rockstar in the world. VH1 included Marilyn Manson at seventy-eight on their list of the &#x27;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&#x27;, and also included &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; at number eighty-six on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs&quot;. Similarly, Gigwise included Manson at number thirty-six in their list of the &#x27;60 Greatest Solo Artists of All Time&#x27;. In 2016, Manson was presented with an Icon Award at the Alternative Press Music Awards. The band has also received four Grammy Award nominations, including two for Best Metal Performance, along with nominations for Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance. Marilyn Manson have sold over 50 million records worldwide.

Several commentators have referred to the band&#x27;s lead singer as being one of the most iconic and controversial figures in heavy metal music, with some going so far as to call him a &quot;pop culture icon&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine said there were &quot;few artists in the 90s as shocking as Marilyn Manson, the most famous of the shock-rockers.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Lorraine Ali credited &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; with marking the end of the reign of grunge within popular music, writing that Marilyn Manson &quot;[offered] total escapism as a true alternative&quot;, elaborating that the album was &quot;a volatile reaction to five years of earnest, post-Nirvana rock.&quot; In 2003, Jon Wiederhorn of MTV called Manson &quot;the only major performer today who can justifiably call himself an artist.&quot; Graham Hartmann of &quot;Loudwire&quot; said that the band&#x27;s best songs document &quot;a career that is unlike any other that came before&quot;, highlighting their mix of a &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll mentality with profound lyrics narrating the progression of society in real time, Manson has developed a polarizing identity as both a beloved hero and a reviled villain.&quot; Hannah Ewers of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote in 2016 that the band&#x27;s music has &quot;never been more relevant [than] at this time of cultural and political turbulence. Whether [his lyrics are addressing] America&#x27;s gun crime problem, sexual abuse, religious hypocrisy or consumerism, Manson remains a relevant cultural figure rather than a 90s one, because he continues to address the times without lapsing into a parody&quot;, and opined: &quot;As long as young people are angry (which they are), he will have listeners.&quot;

The band has been noted as influencing numerous groups within metal-associated genres, such as American Head Charge, Babymetal, Black Veil Brides, Combichrist, Kittie, Korn, Motionless in White, Murderdolls, Mushroomhead, New Years Day, September Mourning, Slipknot, and Vanna. Outside of heavy metal, both the band and its lead singer have inspired a diverse group of acts, including the Astroid Boys, Avril Lavigne, Charli XCX, Creeper, Die Antwoord, Eminem, Grimes, Halsey, Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey, Lil Uzi Vert, Ghostemane, Ski Mask the Slump God, Kid Bookie, Trippie Redd, Lil Peep, Lisa Marie Presley, Muse, My Chemical Romance, Mykki Blanco, Natalia Kills, Porcelain Black, Salem, Skrillex, Skylar Grey and Years &amp; Years. Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson has called Manson an &quot;amazing figure and provocateur and agitator&quot; and said that he was &quot;always challenging you to think about the church, to think about sexuality and to think about society in different ways. We just don&#x27;t have singers like that anymore.&quot; Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins has commended Manson&#x27;s manipulation of the culture of celebrity, saying: &quot;He&#x27;s very savvy, in that he lets people think things about him or plays into things to see what will happen, almost like a performance artist. He&#x27;s a visionary in a way, because he identified a culture that was coming and now that culture is everywhere.&quot;

==Controversies==

In December 1996, Secretary of Education William Bennett, along with U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman and former Pennsylvania Secretary of State C. DeLores Tucker, held a press conference wherein they questioned MCA – the owner of Interscope – president Edgar Bronfman Jr.&#x27;s ability to head the label competently whilst profiting from &quot;profanity-laced&quot; albums by artists such as Tupac Shakur, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Marilyn Manson. The following November, Representative Sam Brownback chaired a hearing of the Committee on Government Affairs. At this subcommittee, Lieberman once again criticized the band&#x27;s music, calling it &quot;vile, hateful, nihilistic and damaging&quot;, and repeated his request that Seagram – then-owner of MCA – &quot;start ... disassociating itself from Marilyn Manson.&quot; The subcommittee also heard from Raymond Kuntz, of Burlington, North Dakota, who blamed his son Richard&#x27;s suicide on &quot;Antichrist Superstar—&quot;specifically the song &quot;The Reflecting God&quot;.

The band&#x27;s live performances have also come under fire—the &quot;Dead to the World Tour&quot;, in particular, was followed by protesters at nearly every North American venue it visited. Several state legislatures, including the Utah State Legislature, South Carolina Legislature and the Virginia General Assembly, enacted legislation specifically targeting the group, which banned them from performing in state-operated venues. These laws would later be repealed, following separate lawsuits from fans, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Ozzy Osbourne, who sued the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority after they forced the cancellation of the New Jersey date of the 1997 Ozzfest at Giants Stadium.

On June 30, 2003, the mutilated body of fourteen-year old schoolgirl Jodi Jones was discovered in woodland near her home in Easthouses, Scotland. The injuries sustained by Jones closely resembled those of actress Elizabeth Short, who was murdered in 1947 and was popularly referred to by media as the Black Dahlia. Jones&#x27;s boyfriend, then-fifteen year old Luke Mitchell, was arrested on suspicion of her murder ten months later. During a search of his home, detectives confiscated a copy of &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot; containing the short film &quot;Doppelherz&quot;. It was purchased two days after Jones&#x27;s death. A ten-minute excerpt from the film, as well as several paintings by Manson depicting the Black Dahlia&#x27;s mutilated body, were presented as evidence during the trial. Mitchell was found guilty of murder and sentenced to serve a minimum of twenty years in prison.

The band&#x27;s scheduled appearance at the Park Live Festival in Moscow on June 27, 2014, was canceled moments before they were due to arrive on stage, after authorities received numerous bomb threats, while hundreds of activists affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church protested outside the venue. The incident culminated in the assault of several members of the band and crew near their hotel. Two days later, a performance in Novosibirsk was also canceled when authorities refused to grant permission for the show to go ahead, accusing Manson of insulting the beliefs of the Orthodox church and of &quot;promoting sadomasochism&quot;. Later that year, Manson garnered significant media attention when a video depicting the simulated rape of Lana Del Rey was posted onto YouTube by production company Sturmgruppe. The video, titled &quot;Sturmgruppe 2013 Reel&quot;, showed simulated footage of film director Eli Roth attacking Del Rey, which was interspersed by unrelated images from two of the band&#x27;s previous music videos—&quot;No Reflection&quot; and &quot;Slo-Mo-Tion&quot;. Manson&#x27;s representatives released a statement to &quot;Billboard&quot; denying any involvement in the production of the rape scenes.

In October 2017, Twiggy Ramirez was accused of sexual assault by ex-girlfriend Jessicka Addams during their relationship in the mid-90s. Soon after, Manson announced that he had &quot;decided to part ways&quot; with his longterm bassist. Several days later, Ramirez released a statement which said: &quot;I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain, I apologize and truly regret it.&quot;

===School shootings===
====Columbine massacre====


On April 20, 1999, Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed twelve students and a teacher, and wounded twenty-one others before committing suicide. In the days following the massacre, media reports surfaced alleging that they were influenced by violence in entertainment, specifically movies, video games and music. The pair were widely reported as being fans of German bands KMFDM and Rammstein, but the majority of blame was directed at Marilyn Manson.

Five days after the incident, longtime music industry critics Republican former Secretary of Education William Bennett and Democratic U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman cited the band as a contributing factor to the massacre during an appearance on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. Soon after, sensationalist headlines such as &quot;Killers Worshipped Rock Freak Manson&quot; and &quot;Devil-Worshipping Maniac Told Kids To Kill&quot; began appearing in media coverage of the tragedy (such as Fox News). The Mayor of Denver, Wellington Webb, successfully petitioned promoters to cancel KBPI-FM&#x27;s annual &#x27;Birthday Bash&#x27;, at which the band was scheduled to appear. Coloradoan politicians such as Governor Bill Owens and Republican Representative Tom Tancredo accused Manson of promoting &quot;hate, violence, death, suicide, drug use and the attitudes and actions of the Columbine High School killers.&quot; Later reports stated that neither Harris nor Klebold were fans of Marilyn Manson. The band canceled the remaining four dates of the Rock Is Dead Tour out of respect for the victims, while maintaining that music, movies, books or video games were not to blame.

Eleven days after the massacre, Manson wrote an op-ed piece for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, titled &quot;Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?&quot;, where he rebuked the ensuing hysteria and &quot;witch hunt&quot;, and castigated US gun culture, the political influence of the National Rifle Association of America, and the media&#x27;s culpability in similarly violent events in the future – through their irresponsible coverage – in facilitating the placement of blame on a scapegoat, instead of informing the populace of genuine societal issues.

====Other shootings====
The controversy connecting the band and school shootings continued on October 10, 2007, following the SuccessTech Academy shooting. After being punched in the face by another student while exiting a bathroom, Asa Coon shot his attacker – Michael Peek – in the abdomen. Armed with two revolvers, he then proceeded down a hallway, where he wounded another student and two teachers by firing into two occupied classrooms, before entering a nearby bathroom and committing suicide. Coon was wearing a black Marilyn Manson T-shirt during the incident.

On May 18, 2009, 15-year-old Justin Doucet, a student at Larose Middle School in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, entered the school armed with a .25-caliber Automatic Colt Pistol. When seventh-grade teacher Jessica Plaisance refused to comply with Doucet&#x27;s demand to say &quot;Hail Marilyn Manson&quot;, he fired two shots, narrowly missing her head, before turning the gun on himself. He died from his injuries a week later.

<text>Mortimer Jerome Adler (; December 28, 1902 – June 28, 2001) was an American philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, popular author and lay theologian. As a philosopher he worked within the Aristotelian and Thomistic traditions. He taught at Columbia University and the University of Chicago, served as chairman of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; board of editors, and founded the Institute for Philosophical Research.

He lived for long stretches in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, and San Mateo, California.

== Biography ==
=== Intellectual development and philosophic evolution ===
While doing newspaper work and taking night classes during his adolescence, Adler encountered works of men he would come to call heroes: Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, John Locke, John Stuart Mill, and others, who &quot;were assailed as irrelevant by student activists in the 1960s and subjected to &#x27;politically correct&#x27; attack in later decades.&quot; His thought evolved toward the correction of what he considered &quot;philosophical mistakes&quot;, as reflected in his 1985 book &quot;Ten Philosophical Mistakes: Basic Errors in Modern Thought&quot;. In Adler&#x27;s view, these errors were introduced by Descartes on the continent and by Thomas Hobbes and David Hume in Britain, and were caused by a &quot;culpable ignorance&quot; about Aristotle by those who rejected the conclusions of dogmatic philosophy without acknowledging its sound classical premises. These modern errors were compounded and perpetuated, according to Adler, by Kant and the idealists and existentialists on the one side, and by John Stuart Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and Bertrand Russell and the English analytic tradition on the other. Adler held that he corrected these mistakes with reference to insights and distinctions drawn from the Aristotelian tradition.

=== New York City ===
Adler was born in Manhattan, New York City, on December 28, 1902, to Jewish immigrants from Germany: Clarissa (Manheim), a schoolteacher, and Ignatz Adler, a jewelry salesman. He dropped out of school at age 14 to become a copy boy for &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, with the ultimate aspiration of becoming a journalist. Adler soon returned to school to take writing classes at night, where he discovered the western philosophical tradition. After his early schooling and work, he went on to study at Columbia University and contributed to the student literary magazine, &quot;The Morningside,&quot; a poem &quot;Choice&quot; (in 1922 when Charles A. Wagner was editor-in-chief and Whittaker Chambers an associate editor). Though he refused to take the required swimming test for a bachelor&#x27;s degree (a matter that was rectified when Columbia gave him an honorary degree in 1983), he stayed at the university and eventually received an instructorship and finally a doctorate in psychology. While at Columbia University, Adler wrote his first book: &quot;Dialectic&quot;, published in 1927.

Adler worked with Scott Buchanan at the People&#x27;s Institute and then for many years on their respective Great Books efforts. (Buchanan was the founder of the Great Books program at St. John&#x27;s College).

=== Chicago ===
In 1930, Robert Hutchins, the newly appointed president of the University of Chicago, whom Adler had befriended some years earlier, arranged for Chicago&#x27;s law school to hire him as a professor of the philosophy of law. The philosophers at Chicago (who included James H. Tufts, E. A. Burtt, and George H. Mead) had &quot;entertained grave doubts as to Dr. Adler&#x27;s competence in the field [of philosophy]&quot; and resisted Adler&#x27;s appointment to the university&#x27;s Department of Philosophy. Adler was the first &quot;non-lawyer&quot; to join the law school faculty. After the Great Books seminar inspired Chicago businessman and university trustee Walter Paepcke to found the Aspen Institute, Adler taught philosophy to business executives there.

=== Popular appeal ===
Adler long strove to bring philosophy to the masses, and some of his works (such as &quot;How to Read a Book&quot;) became popular bestsellers. He was also an advocate of economic democracy and wrote an influential preface to Louis O. Kelso&#x27;s &quot;The Capitalist Manifesto&quot;. Adler was often aided in his thinking and writing by Arthur Rubin, an old friend from his Columbia undergraduate days. In his own words:
Dwight Macdonald once criticized Adler&#x27;s popular style by saying &quot;Mr. Adler once wrote a book called &quot;How to Read a Book&quot;. He should now read a book called &quot;How to Write a Book&quot;.&quot;

== Encyclopedia and Educational Reform ==
Adler and Hutchins went on to found the Great Books of the Western World program and the Great Books Foundation. In 1952, Adler founded and served as director of the Institute for Philosophical Research. He also served on the Board of Editors of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, compiled its Syntopicon and later Propaedia, and succeeded Hutchins as its chairman from 1974. As the director of editorial planning for the fifteenth edition of &quot;Britannica&quot; from 1965, he was instrumental in the major reorganization of knowledge embodied in that edition. He introduced the Paideia Proposal which resulted in his founding the Paideia Program, a grade school curriculum centered around guided reading and discussion of difficult works (as judged for each grade). With Max Weismann, he founded the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas in 1990 in Chicago.

=== Great books of the Western canon === 
== Religion and theology ==
Adler was born into a nonobservant Jewish family. In his early twenties, he discovered St. Thomas Aquinas, and in particular the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;. Many years later, he wrote that its &quot;intellectual austerity, integrity, precision and brilliance ... put the study of theology highest among all of my philosophical interests.&quot; An enthusiastic Thomist, he was a frequent contributor to Catholic philosophical and educational journals, as well as a frequent speaker at Catholic institutions, so much so that some assumed he was a convert to Catholicism. But that was reserved for later.

In 1940, James T. Farrell called Adler &quot;the leading American fellow-traveller of the Roman Catholic Church.&quot; What was true for Adler, Farrell said, was what was &quot;postulated in the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church,&quot; and he &quot;sang the same tune&quot; as avowed Catholic philosophers like Étienne Gilson, Jacques Maritain, and Martin D&#x27;Arcy. He also greatly admired Henri Bergson, the French Jewish philosopher and Nobel laureate, whose books the Catholic church had indexed as prohibited. Bergson refused to convert during the collaborationist Vichy regime, and despite the Statute on Jews he instead restated his previous views and was thus stripped of all his previous posts and honors. Farrell attributed Adler&#x27;s delay in joining the Church to his being among those Christians who &quot;wanted their cake and ... wanted to eat it too&quot; and compared him to the Emperor Constantine, who waited until he was on his deathbed to formally become a Catholic.

Adler took a long time to make up his mind about theological issues. When he wrote &quot;How to Think About God: A Guide for the Twentieth-Century Pagan&quot; in 1980, he claimed to consider himself the pagan of the book&#x27;s subtitle. In volume 51 of the &quot;Mars Hill Audio Journal&quot; (2001), Ken Myers includes his 1980 interview with Adler, conducted after &quot;How to Think About God&quot; was published. Myers reminisces, &quot;During that interview, I asked him why he had never embraced the Christian faith himself. He explained that while he had been profoundly influenced by a number of Christian thinkers during his life, ... there were moral – not intellectual – obstacles to his conversion. He didn&#x27;t explain any further.&quot;

Myers notes that Adler finally &quot;surrendered to the Hound of Heaven&quot; and &quot;made a confession of faith and was baptized&quot; as an Episcopalian in 1984, only a few years after that interview. Offering insight into Adler&#x27;s conversion, Myers quotes him from a subsequent 1990 article in &quot;Christianity&quot; magazine: &quot;My chief reason for choosing Christianity was because the mysteries were incomprehensible. What&#x27;s the point of revelation if we could figure it out ourselves? If it were wholly comprehensible, then it would just be another philosophy.&quot;

According to his friend Deal Hudson, Adler &quot;had been attracted to Catholicism for many years&quot; and &quot;wanted to be a Roman Catholic, but issues like abortion and the resistance of his family and friends&quot; kept him away. Many thought he was baptized as an Episcopalian rather than a Catholic solely because of his &quot;wonderful – and ardently Episcopal – wife&quot; Caroline. Hudson suggests it is no coincidence that it was only after her death in 1998 that he took the final step. In December 1999, in San Mateo, where he had moved to spend his last years, Adler was formally received into the Catholic Church by a long-time friend and admirer, Bishop Pierre DuMaine. &quot;Finally,&quot; wrote another friend, Ralph McInerny, &quot;he became the Roman Catholic he had been training to be all his life&quot;.

Despite not being a Catholic for most of his life, on account of his lifelong participation in the Neo-Thomist movement and his almost equally long membership in the American Catholic Philosophical Association, this latter, according to McInerny is willing to consider Adler &quot;a Catholic philosopher&quot;.

== Philosophy ==
Adler referred to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; as the &quot;ethics of common sense&quot; and also as &quot;the only moral philosophy that is sound, practical, and undogmatic.&quot; Thus, it is the only ethical doctrine that answers all the questions that moral philosophy should and can attempt to answer, neither more nor less, and that has answers that are true by the standard of truth that is appropriate and applicable to normative judgments. In contrast, Adler believed that other theories or doctrines try to answer more questions than they can or fewer than they should, and their answers are mixtures of truth and error, particularly the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant.

Adler was a self-proclaimed &quot;moderate dualist&quot; and viewed the positions of psychophysical dualism and materialistic monism to be opposite sides of two extremes. Regarding dualism, he dismissed the extreme form of dualism that stemmed from such philosophers as Plato (body and soul) and Descartes (mind and matter), as well as the theory of extreme monism and the mind–brain identity theory. After eliminating the extremes, Adler subscribed to a more moderate form of dualism. He believed that the brain is only a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for conceptual thought; that an &quot;immaterial intellect&quot; is also requisite as a condition; and that the difference between human and animal behavior is a radical difference in kind. Adler defended this position against many challenges to dualistic theories.

===Freedom and free will===
The meanings of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;free will&quot; have been and are under debate, and the debate is confused because there is no generally accepted definition of either term. Adler&#x27;s &quot;Institute for Philosophical Research&quot; spent ten years studying the &quot;idea of freedom&quot; as the word was used by hundreds of authors who have discussed and disputed freedom. The study was published in 1958 as Volume One of &quot;The Idea of Freedom&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom&quot; with subsequent comments in &quot;Adler&#x27;s Philosophical Dictionary&quot;. Adler&#x27;s study concluded that a delineation of three kinds of freedom – circumstantial, natural, and acquired – is necessary for clarity on the subject.
# &quot;Circumstantial freedom&quot; denotes &quot;freedom from coercion or restraint.&quot;
# &quot;Natural freedom&quot; denotes &quot;freedom of a free will&quot; or &quot;free choice.&quot; It is the freedom to determine one&#x27;s own decisions or plans. This freedom exists in everyone inherently, regardless of circumstances or state of mind.
# &quot;Acquired freedom&quot; is the freedom &quot;to will as we ought to will&quot; and, thus, &quot;to live as [one] ought to live.&quot; This freedom is not inherent: it must be acquired by a change whereby a person gains qualities as &quot;good, wise, virtuous, etc.&quot;

===Religion===
As Adler&#x27;s interest in religion and theology increased, he made references to the Bible and the need to test articles of faith for compatibility with the conclusions of the science of nature and of philosophers. In his 1981 book &quot;How to Think About God&quot;, Adler attempts to demonstrate God as the exnihilator (the creator of something from nothing). Adler stressed that even with this conclusion, God&#x27;s existence cannot be proven or demonstrated, but only established as true beyond a reasonable doubt. However, in a recent re-review of the argument, John Cramer concluded that recent developments in cosmology appear to converge with and support Adler&#x27;s argument, and that in light of such theories as the multiverse, the argument is no worse for wear and may, indeed, now be judged somewhat more probable than it was originally.

Adler believed that, if theology and religion are living things, there is nothing intrinsically wrong about efforts to modernize them. They must be open to change and growth like everything else. Furthermore, there is no reason to be surprised when discussions such as those about the &quot;death of God&quot; – a concept drawn from Friedrich Nietzsche – stir popular excitement as they did in the recent past and could do so again today. According to Adler, of all the great ideas, the idea of God has always been and continues to be the one that evokes the greatest concern among the widest group of men and women. However, he was opposed to the idea of converting atheism into a new form of religion or theology.

== Personal life ==
Mortimer Adler was married twice and had four children. He married Helen Boynton in 1927. Together they adopted two children, Mark and Michael, in 1938 and 1940, respectively. They divorced in 1960. In 1963, Adler married Caroline Pring, his junior by thirty-four years; they had two children, Douglas and Philip.

<doc id="19455" wikidata="Q9387" url="?curid=19455" title="Max Weber">
<text>Maximilian Carl Emil Weber (; ; 21 April 186414 June 1920) was a German sociologist, historian, jurist, and political economist who was one of the central figures in the development of sociology and the social sciences more generally. His ideas continue to influence social theory and research.

Born in Erfurt in 1864, Weber studied law and history in Berlin, Göttingen, and Heidelberg. After earning his doctorate in law in 1889 and habilitation in 1891, he taught in Berlin, Freiburg, and Heidelberg. He married his cousin Marianne Schnitger two years later. In 1897, he had a breakdown after his father died following an argument. Weber ceased teaching and travelled until the early 1900s. He recovered and wrote &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;. During the First World War, he initially supported Germany&#x27;s war effort but became critical of it and supported democratisation. He also gave the lectures &quot;Science as a Vocation&quot; and &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot;. After the war, Weber co-founded the German Democratic Party, unsuccessfully ran for office, and advised the drafting of the Weimar Constitution. Becoming frustrated with politics, he resumed teaching in Vienna and Munich. He died of pneumonia in 1920 at the age of 56, possibly as a result of the post-war Spanish flu pandemic. A book, &quot;Economy and Society&quot;, was left unfinished.

One of Weber&#x27;s main intellectual concerns was in understanding the processes of rationalisation, secularisation, and disenchantment. He formulated a thesis arguing that such processes were associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity. Weber also argued that the Protestant work ethic influenced the creation of capitalism in &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;. It was followed by &quot;The Economic Ethics of the World Religions&quot;, where he examined the religions of China, India, and ancient Judaism. In terms of government, Weber argued that states were defined by their monopoly on violence and categorised social authority into three distinct forms: charismatic, traditional, and rational-legal. He was also a key proponent of methodological antipositivism, arguing for the study of social action through interpretive rather than purely empiricist methods. Weber made a variety of other contributions to economic sociology, political sociology, and the sociology of religion.

After his death, the rise of Weberian scholarship was slowed by the Weimar Republic&#x27;s political instability and the rise of Nazi Germany. In the post-war era, organised scholarship began to appear, led by Talcott Parsons. Other American and British scholars were also involved in its development. Over the course of the twentieth century, Weber&#x27;s reputation rose due to the publication of translations of his works and scholarly interpretations of his life and works. As a result of these works, he began to be regarded as a founding father of sociology, alongside Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim, and one of the central figures in the development of the social sciences more generally.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Maximilian Carl Emil Weber was born on 21 April 1864 in Erfurt, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia, and his family moved to Berlin in 1869. He was the oldest of Max Weber Sr. and Helene Fallenstein&#x27;s eight children. Over the course of his life, Weber Sr. held posts as a lawyer, civil servant, and parliamentarian for the National Liberal Party in the Prussian Landtag and German Reichstag. His involvement in public life immersed his home in both politics and academia, as his salon welcomed scholars and public figures such as the philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey, the jurist Levin Goldschmidt, and the historian Theodor Mommsen. The young Weber and his brother Alfred, who also became a sociologist, passed their formative years in this intellectual atmosphere. Meanwhile, Fallenstein was partly descended from the French Huguenot , which had obtained wealth through international commerce and the textile industry. Over time, Weber was affected by the marital and personality tensions between his father, who enjoyed material pleasures while overlooking religious and philanthropic causes, and his mother, a devout Calvinist and philanthropist.

Weber entered the in Charlottenburg in 1870, before attending the between 1872 and 1882. While in class, bored and unimpressed with his teachers, Weber secretly read all forty volumes by the writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe later exerted an important influence on his thought and methodology. Before entering university, he read many other classical works, including those by the philosopher Immanuel Kant. For Christmas in 1877, a thirteen-year-old Weber gifted his parents two historical essays, entitled &quot;About the Course of German History, with Special Reference to the Positions of the Emperor and the Pope&quot; and &quot;About the Roman Imperial Period from Constantine to the Migration Period&quot;. Two years later, also during Christmastime, he wrote another historical essay, &quot;Observations on the Ethnic Character, Development, and History of the Indo-European Nations&quot;. These three essays were non-derivative contributions to the philosophy of history and were derived from Weber&#x27;s reading of &quot;numerous sources&quot;.

In 1882, Weber enrolled in Heidelberg University as a law student, later studying at the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin and the University of Göttingen. He practiced law and worked as a lecturer simultaneously with his studies. In 1886, Weber passed the Referendar examination, which was comparable to the bar association examination in the British and U.S. legal systems. Throughout the late 1880s, he continued to study law and history. Under the tutelage of Levin Goldschmidt and Rudolf von Gneist, Weber earned his law doctorate in 1889 by writing a dissertation on legal history titled &quot;Development of the Principle of Joint Liability and a Separate Fund of the General Partnership out of the Household Communities and Commercial Associations in Italian Cities&quot;. It was a part of a longer work, &quot;On the History of Commercial Partnerships in the Middle Ages, Based on Southern European Documents&quot;, which he published in the same year. In the same year, Weber began working with the statistician August Meitzen to complete his habilitation, a post-doctoral thesis, and completed it two years later. The dissertation, titled &quot;Roman Agrarian History and Its Significance for Public and Private Law&quot;, focused on the relationship between Roman surveying and Roman agrarian law. Having thus become a , Weber joined the faculty of the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin, lecturing, conducting research, and consulting for the government.

Weber&#x27;s years as a university student were dotted with several periods of military service, the longest of which lasted between October 1883 and September 1884. During this time, he was in Strasbourg and attended classes at the University of Strasbourg that his uncle, the historian Hermann Baumgarten, taught. Weber befriended Baumgarten and he influenced Weber&#x27;s growing liberalism and criticism of Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s domination of German politics. He was a member of the &quot;&quot;, a (&quot;student association&quot;), and heavily drank beer and engaged in academic fencing during his first few years in university. As a result of the latter, he obtained several duelling scars on the left side of his face. His mother was displeased by his behaviour and slapped him after he came home when his third semester ended in 1883. However, Weber matured, increasingly supported his mother in family arguments, and grew estranged from his father.

===Marriage, early work, and breakdown===

From 1887 until her declining mental health caused him to break off their relationship five years later, Weber had a relationship and semi-engagement with Emmy Baumgarten, the daughter of Hermann Baumgarten. Afterwards, he began a relationship with his distant cousin Marianne Schnitger in 1893 and married her on 20 September of that year. The marriage gave Weber financial independence, allowing him to leave his parents&#x27; household. They had no children. Marianne was a feminist activist and an author in her own right. Academically, between the completion of his dissertation and habilitation, Weber took an interest in contemporary social policy. He joined the (&quot;Association for Social Policy&quot;) in 1888. The was an organisation of reformist thinkers who were generally members of the historical school of economics. He also involved himself in politics, participating in the founding of the left-leaning Evangelical Social Congress in 1890. It applied a Protestant perspective to the political debate regarding the social question. In the same year, the established a research program to examine the , which was the western migration of ethnically German agricultural labourers from eastern Germany and the corresponding influx of Polish farm workers into it. Weber was put in charge of the study and wrote a large part of the final report, which generated considerable attention and controversy, marking the beginning of his renown as a social scientist.

From 1893 to 1899, Weber was a member of the Pan-German League (), an organisation that campaigned against the influx of Polish workers. The degree of his support for the Germanisation of Poles and similar nationalist policies continues to be debated by scholars. Weber and his wife moved to Freiburg in 1894, where he was appointed professor of economics at the University of Freiburg. During his tenure there, in 1895, he gave a provocative lecture titled &quot;The Nation State and Economic Policy&quot;. In it, he criticised Polish immigration and argued that the Junkers were encouraging Slavic immigration to serve their economic interests over those of the German nation. It influenced the politician Friedrich Naumann to create the National-Social Association, which was a Christian socialist and nationalist political organisation. Weber was pessimistic regarding the association&#x27;s ability to succeed, and it dissolved after winning a single seat in the Reichstag during the 1903 German federal election. In 1896, he accepted an appointment to a chair in economics and finance at Heidelberg University. There, Weber and his wife became the central figures in the eponymous Weber Circle, which included Georg Jellinek, Ernst Troeltsch, and Werner Sombart. Younger scholars, such as György Lukács and Robert Michels, also joined it.

In 1897, Weber had a severe quarrel with his father. Weber Sr. died two months later, leaving the argument unresolved. Afterwards, Weber became increasingly prone to depression, nervousness, and insomnia, which made it difficult for him to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him seek an exemption from his teaching obligations, which he was granted in 1899. He spent time in the in 1898 and in a different sanatorium in Bad Urach in 1900. Weber also travelled to Corsica and Italy between 1899 and 1903 in order to alleviate his illness. He fully withdrew from teaching in 1903 and did not return to it until 1918. Weber thoroughly described his ordeal with mental illness in a personal chronology that his widow later destroyed. Its destruction was possibly caused by Marianne&#x27;s fear that his work would have been discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known.

===Later work===

After recovering from his illness, Weber accepted a position as an associate editor of the (&quot;Archive for Social Science and Social Policy&quot;) in 1904, alongside his colleagues Edgar Jaffé and Werner Sombart. It facilitated his reintroduction to academia and became one of the most prominent social science journals as a result of his efforts. Weber published some of his most seminal works in this journal, including his book &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;, which became his most famous work and laid the foundations for his later research on the impact of religion on the development of economic systems. Also in 1904, he was invited to participate in the Congress of Arts and Sciences that was held in connection with the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis alongside his wife, Werner Sombart, Ernst Troeltsch, and other German scholars. Taking advantage of the fair, the Webers embarked on a trip that began and ended in New York City and lasted for almost three months. They travelled throughout the country, from New England to the Deep South. Different communities were visited, including German immigrant towns and African American communities. North Carolina was also visited, as some of Weber&#x27;s relatives in the Fallenstein family had settled there. Weber used the trip to learn more about America&#x27;s social, economic, and theological conditions and how they related to his thesis. Afterwards, he felt that he was unable to resume regular teaching and remained a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907.

Shortly after returning, Weber&#x27;s attention shifted to the then-recent Russian Revolution of 1905. He learned the Russian language in a few months, subscribed to Russian newspapers, and discussed Russian political and social affairs with the Russian community in Heidelberg. He was personally popular in that community and twice entertained the idea of a trip to Russia. His schedule prevented it, however. While he was sceptical of the revolution&#x27;s ability to succeed, Weber supported the establishment of a liberal democracy in Russia. He wrote two essays on it that were published in the . Weber interpreted the revolution as having been the result of the peasants&#x27; desire for land. He discussed the role of the , rural peasant communities, in Russian political debates. According to Weber, they were difficult for liberal agrarian reformers to abolish due to a combination of their basis in natural law and the rising class manipulating them for their own gain. His general interpretation of the Russian Revolution was that it lacked a clear leader and was not based on the Russian intellectuals&#x27; goals. Instead, it was the result of the peasants&#x27; emotional passions.

In 1909, having become increasingly dissatisfied with the political conservatism and perceived lack of methodological discipline of the , he co-founded the German Sociological Association () and served as its first treasurer. Weber associated the society with the and viewed the two organisations as not having been competitors. He unsuccessfully tried to steer the direction of the association. As part of that, Weber tried to make the its official journal. He resigned from his position as treasurer in 1912. That was caused by his support for value-freedom in the social sciences, as that was a controversial position in the association. Weberalongside Simmel, Sombart, and Tönniesplaced an abbreviated form of it into the association&#x27;s statutes, prompting criticism from its other members. In the same year, Weber and his wife befriended a former student of his, Else von Richthofen, and the pianist . After a failed attempt to court Richthofen, Weber began an affair with Tobler in 1911.

===Political involvements===
Later, during the spring of 1913, Weber holidayed in the Monte Verità community in Ascona, Switzerland. While holidaying, he was advising Frieda Gross in her custody battle for her children. He opposed Erich Mühsam&#x27;s involvement because Mühsam was an anarchist. Weber argued that the case needed to be dealt with by bourgeois reformers who were not &quot;derailed&quot;. A year later, also in spring, he again holidayed in Ascona. The community contained several different expressions of the then-contemporaneous radical political and lifestyle reform movements. They included naturism, free love, and Western esotericism, among others. Weber was critical of the anarchist and erotic movements in Ascona, as he viewed their fusion as having been politically absurd.

====First World War====
After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Weber volunteered for service and was appointed as a reserve officer in charge of organising the army hospitals in Heidelberg, a role he fulfilled until the end of 1915. His views on the war and the expansion of the German Empire changed over the course of the conflict. Early on, he supported the German war effort, with some hesitation, viewing the war as having been necessary to fulfill Germany&#x27;s duty as a leading state power. In time, however, Weber became one of the most prominent critics of both German expansionism and the Kaiser&#x27;s war policies. He publicly criticised Germany&#x27;s potential annexation of Belgium and unrestricted submarine warfare, later supporting calls for constitutional reform, democratisation, and universal suffrage. His younger brother Karl, an architect, was killed near Brest-Litovsk in 1915 while fighting in the war. Weber had previously viewed him negatively but his death made him feel more connected to him.

He and his wife also participated in the 1917 Lauenstein Conferences that were held at in Bavaria. These conferences were planned by the publisher Eugen Diederichs and brought together intellectuals, including Theodor Heuss, Ernst Toller, and Werner Sombart. Weber&#x27;s presence elevated his profile in Germany and served to dispel some of the event&#x27;s romantic atmosphere. After he spoke at the first one, he became involved in the planning for the second one, as Diederichs thought that the conferences needed someone who could serve as an oppositional figure. In this capacity, he argued against the political romanticism that Max Maurenbrecher, a former theologian, espoused. Weber also opposed what he saw as the excessive rhetoric of the youth groups and nationalists at Lauenstein, instead supporting German democratisation. For Weber and the younger participants, the conferences&#x27; romantic intent was irrelevant to the determination of Germany&#x27;s future. In November, shortly after the second conference, Weber was invited by the Free Student Youth, a student organisation, to give a lecture in Munich, resulting in &quot;Science as a Vocation&quot;. In it, he argued that an inner calling and specialisation were necessary for one to become a scholar. Weber also began a sadomasochistic affair with Else von Richthofen the next year. Meanwhile, she was simultaneously conducting an affair with his brother, Alfred. Max Weber&#x27;s affairs with Richtofen and Mina Tobler lasted until his death in 1920.

====Weimar Republic====
After the war ended, Weber unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Weimar National Assembly in January 1919 as a member of the liberal German Democratic Party, which he had co-founded. He also advised the National Assembly in its drafting of the Weimar Constitution. While he was campaigning for his party, Weber critiqued the left and complained about Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg who led the leftist Spartacus League. He regarded the German Revolution of 1918–1919 as having been responsible for Germany&#x27;s inability to fight against Poland&#x27;s claims on its eastern territories. His opposition to the revolution may have prevented Friedrich Ebert, the new president of Germany and a member of the Social Democratic Party, from appointing him as a minister or ambassador. Weber was also critical of the Treaty of Versailles, which he believed unjustly assigned war guilt to Germany. Instead, he believed that many countries were guilty of starting it, not just Germany. In making this case, Weber argued that Russia was the only great power that actually desired the war. He also regarded Germany as not having been culpable for its invasion of Belgium, viewing Belgian neutrality as having obscured an alliance with France. Overall, Weber&#x27;s political efforts were largely unsuccessful, with the exception of his support for a democratically elected and strong presidency.

On 28 January 1919, after his electoral defeat, Weber delivered a lecture titled &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot;, which commented on the subject of politics. It was prompted by the early Weimar Republic&#x27;s political turmoil and was requested by the Free Student Youth. Shortly before he left to join the delegation in Versailles on 13 May 1919, Weber used his connections with the German National People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s deputies to meet with Erich Ludendorff. He spent several hours unsuccessfully trying to convince Ludendorff to surrender himself to the Allies. This debate also shifted to other subjects, such as who was culpable for Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war. Weber thought that the German high command had failed, while Ludendorff regarded Weber as a democrat who was partially responsible for the revolution. Weber tried to disabuse him of that notion by expressing support for a democratic system with a strong executive. Since he held Ludendorff responsible for Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war and having sent many young Germans to die on the battlefield, Weber thought that he should surrender himself and become a political martyr. However, Ludendorff was not willing to do so and instead wanted to live off of his pension.

===Last years===
Frustrated with politics, Weber resumed teaching, first at the University of Vienna in 1918, then at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1919. In Vienna, Weber filled a previously vacant chair in political economy that he had been in consideration for since October 1917. Later, in Munich, he was appointed to Lujo Brentano&#x27;s chair in social science, economic history, and political economy. He accepted the appointment in order to be closer to his mistress, Else von Richthofen. Responding to student requests, he gave a series of lectures on economic history. The student transcriptions of it were later edited and published as the &quot;General Economic History&quot; by and in 1923. In terms of politics, he opposed the pardoning of the Bavarian Minister-President Kurt Eisner&#x27;s murderer, Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley. In response to that, right-wing students disrupted his classes and protested in front of his home.

In early 1920, Weber gave a seminar that contained a discussion of Oswald Spengler&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the West&quot;. Weber respected him and privately described him as having been &quot;a very brilliant and scholarly dilettante&quot;. That seminar provoked some of his students, who knew Spengler personally, to suggest that he debate Spengler alongside other scholars. They met in the Munich town hall and debated for two days. The audience was primarily young Germans with different political perspectives, including communists. While neither of them were able to convince the other of their points, Weber was more cautious and careful in his arguments against Spengler than the other debaters were. Afterwards, the students did not feel that the question of how to resolve Germany&#x27;s post-war issues had been answered.

Lili Schäfer, one of Weber&#x27;s sisters, committed suicide on 7 April 1920 after the pedagogue Paul Geheeb ended his affair with her. Weber thought positively of it, as he thought that her suicide was justified and that suicide in general could be an honourable act. Weber and his wife took in Lili&#x27;s four children and planned to raise them. He was uncomfortable with his newfound role as a father figure, but he thought that Marianne was fulfilled as a woman by this event. She later formally adopted them in 1928. Weber wished for her to stay with the children in Heidelberg or move closer to Geheeb&#x27;s (&quot;Odenwald School&quot;) so that he could be alone in Munich with his mistress, Else von Richthofen. He left the decision to Marianne, but she said that only he could make the decision to leave for himself. While this was occurring, Weber began to believe that own life had reached its end.

On 4 June 1920, Weber&#x27;s students were informed that he had a cold and needed to cancel classes. By 14 June 1920, the cold had turned into influenza and he died of pneumonia in Munich. He had likely contracted the Spanish flu during the post-war pandemic and been subjected to insufficient medical care. Else von Richthofen, who was present by his deathbed alongside his wife, thought that he could have survived his illness if he had been given better treatment. His body was cremated in the Munich after a secular ceremony, and the urn that contained his ashes was later buried in the Heidelberg &quot;&quot; in 1921. The funeral service was attended by his students, including and Karl Loewenstein, and fellow scholars, such as Lujo Brentano. At the time of his death, Weber had not finished writing &quot;Economy and Society&quot;, his on sociological theory. His widow, Marianne, helped prepare it for its publication in 1922. She later published a biography of her late husband in 1926 which became one of the central historical accounts of his life.

==Methodology==
Weber&#x27;s sociology treated social action as its central focus. He also interpreted it as having been an important part of the field&#x27;s scientific nature. He divided social action into the four categories of affectional, traditional, instrumental, and value-rational action. In his methodology, he distinguished himself from Émile Durkheim and Karl Marx in that his primary focus was on individuals and culture. Whereas Durkheim focused on society, Weber concentrated on the individual and their actions. Meanwhile, compared to Marx&#x27;s support for the primacy of the material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating individuals&#x27; actions. He had a different perspective from the two of them regarding structure and action and macrostructure in that he was open to the idea that social phenomena could have several different causes and placed importance on social actors&#x27; interpretations of their actions.


In terms of methodology, Weber was primarily concerned with the question of objectivity and subjectivity, distinguishing social action from social behavior and noting that social action must be understood through the subjective relationships between individuals. According to him, the study of social action through interpretive means or (&quot;to understand&quot;) needed to be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attached to their actions. Determining an individual&#x27;s interpretation of their actions required either empathically or rationally derived evidence. Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in the social sciences made the creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in the natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences were able to create was limited. Overall, he supported objective science as a goal worth striving for but noted that it was ultimately an unreachable goal.

Weber&#x27;s methodology was developed in the context of wider debates about social scientific methodology. The first of which was the (&quot;method dispute&quot;). His position in it was close to historicism, as he thought that social actions were heavily tied to particular historical contexts. Furthermore, analysing social actions required an understanding of the relevant individuals&#x27; subjective motivations. Therefore, his methodology emphasised the use of comparative historical analysis. As such, he was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes than in predicting those processes&#x27; outcome in the future. The second debate that shaped Weber&#x27;s perspective on methodology was the (&quot;value-judgement dispute&quot;). This debate was held between 1909 and 1914 on the subject of value-judgements in the social sciences. It originated with a debate in the between the supporters of the idea that ethics was an important consideration in the field of economics and those who opposed it. Weber&#x27;s position was that the social sciences should strive to be value-free. In his view, scholars and students needed to avoid promoting political values in the classroom. Science had no part in the choosing of values. With regards to economics, he argued that productivity was not a useful scientific concept, as it could impede the proper evaluation of economic phenomena.

===Methodological individualism===
The principle of methodological individualism, which holds that social scientists should seek to understand collectivities solely as the result of individual people&#x27;s actions, can be traced to Weber. The term &quot;methodological individualism&quot; was coined in 1908 by the Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter as a way of referring to Weber&#x27;s views on how to explain social phenomena. While his research interests placed a strong emphasis on interpreting economic history, Weber&#x27;s support of methodological individualism represented a break with the historical school and an agreement with the Austrian school&#x27;s founder, Carl Menger, in the . In the first chapter of &quot;Economy and Society&quot;, he argued that only individuals &quot;can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively understandable action&quot;. Despite the term&#x27;s usage of &quot;individualism&quot;, Weber did not interpret the individual as being the true source for sociological explanations. Instead, while only individuals could engage in intentional action, they were not necessarily separate from the collective group. He interpreted methodological individualism as having had close proximity to (&quot;interpretive&quot;) sociology, as actions could be interpreted subjectively. Similarly, it was also related to ideal types in that it involved discussions of abstract and rational models of human behaviour.

===Ideal type===
The ideal type was a central concept in Weber&#x27;s methodology. He interpreted them as having been indispensable for it. Due their taking of meaning into account, they are unique to the social sciences. The term &quot;ideal type&quot; was derived from Georg Jellinek&#x27;s use of it. Weber outlined it in &quot;The &#x27;Objectivity&#x27; of Knowledge in Social Science and Social Policy&quot; and the first chapter of &quot;Economy and Society&quot;. The ideal types&#x27; three functions are the formulation of terminology, classifications, and hypotheses. The latter task was of the greatest importance of the three. In terms of their construction, an ideal type is a schematic that represents a social action and considers the role of meaning in it. By its nature, it was an exaggeration of an empirical situation through its assumption that the involved individuals were rational, had complete situational knowledge, were completely aware of the situation, were completely aware of their actions, and made no errors. This was then contrasted with empirical reality, allowing the researcher to better understand it. However, ideal types are not direct representations of reality and Weber warned against interpreting them as such. He placed no limits on what could be analysed through the use of ideal types. Since, for him, rational methodology and science were synonymous with one another, ideal types were constructed rationally.

===Value-freedom===
Weber believed that social scientists needed to avoid making value-judgements. Instead, he wanted social scientific research to be value-free. This would give them objectivity, but it needed to be combined with an acknowledgement that their research connected with values in different ways. As part of his support for value-freedom, Weber opposed both instructors and students promoting their political views in the classroom. He first articulated it in his writings on scientific philosophy, including &quot;The &#x27;Objectivity&#x27; of Knowledge in Social Science and Social Policy&quot; and &quot;Science as a Vocation&quot;. Weber was influenced by Heinrich Rickert&#x27;s concept of value-relevance. Rickert used it to relate historical objects to values while maintaining objectivity through explicitly defined conceptual distinctions. However, Weber disagreed with the idea that a scholar could maintain objectivity while ascribing to a hierarchy of values in the way that Rickert did, however. His argument regarding value-freedom was connected to his involvement in the . As part of it, he argued in favour of the idea that the social sciences needed to be value-free. During it, he unsuccessfully tried to turn the German Sociological Association into a value-free organisation. Ultimately, that prompted his resignation from it.

==Theories==
===Rationalisation===
Rationalisation was a central theme in Weber&#x27;s scholarship. This theme was situated in the larger context of the relationship between psychological motivations, cultural values, cultural beliefs, and the structure of the society. Weber understood rationalisation as having resulted in increasing knowledge, growing impersonality, and the enhanced control of social and material life. He was ambivalent towards rationalisation. Weber admitted that it was responsible for many advances, particularly freeing humans from traditional, restrictive, and illogical social guidelines. However, he also criticised it for dehumanising individuals as &quot;cogs in the machine&quot; and curtailing their freedom, trapping them in the iron cage of rationality and bureaucracy. His studies of the subject began with &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;. In it, he argued that Protestantism&#x27;sparticularly Calvinism&#x27;sredefinition of the connection between work and piety caused a shift towards rational efforts that were aimed at achieving economic gain. In Protestantism, piety towards God was expressed through one&#x27;s secular vocation. The religious principles that influenced the creation of capitalism became unnecessary and it became able to propagate itself without them.

Weber continued his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy and on the classification of legitimate authority into three ideal typesrational-legal, traditional, and charismaticof which rational-legal was the dominant one in the modern world. In these works, Weber described what he saw as society&#x27;s movement towards rationalisation. Bureaucratic states justified themselves through their own rationality and were supported by expert knowledge which made them rational. Rationalisation could also be seen in the economy, with the development of a highly rational and calculating capitalism. Capitalism&#x27;s rationality related to its basis in calculation, which separated it from alternative forms of economic organisation. State bureaucracy and capitalism served as the twin pillars of the developing rational society. These changes eliminated the preexisting traditions that relied on the trades. Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors that set the West apart from the rest of the world. He also applied rationalisation to music in his &quot;The Rational and Social Foundations of Music&quot;. In writing it, he was influenced by his affair with the pianist and a sense that Western music was the only type that had become harmonic, while other cultures&#x27; music was more intense and focused on hearing. Weber argued that music was becoming increasingly rational. In his view, that resulted from new developments in musical instrument construction and simultaneous socio-economic shifts of the different instruments&#x27; players.

===Disenchantment===
The process of disenchantment caused the world to become more explained and less mystical, moving from polytheistic religions to monotheistic ones and finally to the Godless science of modernity. Older explanations of why events occurred relied on the belief in supernatural interference in the material world. Due to disenchantment, this gave way to rational and scientific explanations for events. According to the &quot;Sociology of Religion&quot; religious activity began with actions in the material world that people associated with vague spirits and gave magical meanings to. Over time, these magical beliefs became increasingly systemised and the spirits became gods that were represented by symbols. This increasing theological systemisation resulted in polytheism and organised religion. Increasing rationality caused the development of Western monotheism, which resulted in groups focusing on specific gods for political and economic purposes, creating a universal religion. According to Weber, Protestantism encouraged an increased pursuit of rationality that led to the devaluing of itself. In turn, this devaluation led to nihilism through its destruction of unifying values.

===&quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;===


&quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; is Weber&#x27;s most famous work. It was his first work on how religions affected economic systems&#x27; development. In the book, he put forward the thesis that the Protestant work ethic, which was derived from the theological ideas of the Reformation, influenced the development of capitalism. Weber was looking for elective affinities between the Protestant work ethic and capitalism. He argued that the Puritans&#x27; religious calling to work caused them to systematically obtain wealth. They wished to prove that they were members of the elect who were destined to go to Heaven. Weber used Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s personal ethic, as described in his &quot;Advice to a Young Tradesman&quot;, as an example of the Protestant sects&#x27; economic ethic. Both rationalisation and the ideal type, concepts that later became central to his scholarship, appeared in the thesis. Rationalisation caused the West to be trapped in the (&quot;iron cage&quot; or &quot;steel-hard casing&quot;) that was the modern capitalist economic order. Meanwhile, ideal types were representative figures, or case studies, that represented concepts.

Christian religious devotion was historically accompanied by the rejection of mundane affairs, including economic pursuit. Weber argued that the origin of modern capitalism was in the religious ideas of the Reformation. According to him, certain types of Protestantismnotably Calvinismwere supportive of the rational pursuit of economic gain and the worldly activities that were dedicated to it, seeing those activities as having been endowed with moral and spiritual significance. The spirit of capitalism was found in the desire to work hard in a way that pleased the worker and signified their worth and originally had a basis in theology. In particular, the Protestant work ethic motivated the believers to work hard, be successful in business, and reinvest their profits in further development rather than frivolous pleasures. Weber thought that self-restraint, hard work, and a belief that wealth could be a sign of salvation were representative of ascetic Protestantism. Ascetic Protestants practiced inner-worldly asceticism and sought to change the world to better reflect their beliefs. The notion of a religious calling, when combined with predestination, meant that each individual had to take action to prove their salvation to themselves. However, the success that these religious principles created ultimately removed them as an influence on modern capitalism as a result of its creation of a worldly perspective. As a result, the inheritors of that system were entrapped in a socioeconomic iron cage.

===&quot;The Economic Ethics of the World Religions&quot;===
Weber&#x27;s work in the field of sociology of religion began with the book &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;. It continued with the book series &quot;The Economic Ethics of the World Religions&quot;, which contained &quot;The Religion of China&quot;, &quot;The Religion of India&quot;, and &quot;Ancient Judaism&quot;. However, his work was left incomplete as a result of his sudden death in 1920, which prevented him from following &quot;Ancient Judaism&quot; with studies of early Christianity and Islam. The three main themes within the books were: religious ideas&#x27; effect on economic activities, the relationship between social stratification and religious ideas, and the distinguishable characteristics of Western civilisation. His goal was to find reasons for the different developmental paths of the cultures of the Western world and the Eastern world, without making value-judgements, unlike the contemporaneous social Darwinists. Weber simply wanted to explain the distinctive elements of Western civilisation. Weber also proposed a socio-evolutionary model of religious change where societies moved from magic to ethical monotheism, with the intermediatory steps of polytheism, pantheism, and monotheism. According to him, this was the result of growing economic stability, which allowed for professionalisation and the evolution of an increasingly sophisticated priesthood. As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed. Meanwhile, as their power became more centralised, the concept of a universal God became more popular and desirable.

====&quot;The Religion of China&quot;====
In &quot;The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism&quot;, Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were different from those of Western Europe, especially those aspects that contrasted with Puritanism. As part of that, he questioned why capitalism had not developed in China. He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese patrimonialism and officialdom and Chinese religion and philosophyprimarily Confucianism and Taoismas the areas in which Chinese development significantly differed from the European route. According to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism were superficially similar, but were actually largely different from one another. Instead, they were mutually exclusive types of rational thought, each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma. Notably, they both valued self-control and restraint and did not oppose accumulation of wealth. However, both of those qualities were simply means to different final goals. Confucianism&#x27;s goal was &quot;a cultured status position&quot;, while Puritanism&#x27;s goal was to create individuals who were &quot;tools of God&quot;. According to Weber, the Puritans sought rational control of the world and rejected its irrationality while Confucians sought rational acceptance of that state of affairs. Therefore, he stated that it was the difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China.

====&quot;The Religion of India&quot;====
In &quot;The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism&quot;, Weber dealt with the structure of Indian society, with the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally with the impact of religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society. In Weber&#x27;s view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The Indian caste system, which developed in post-Classical India and served as the source for legitimate social interactions, served as a key part of that. Both Hinduism and the Brahmins&#x27; high status upheld the caste system. The Brahmins used their monopoly on education and theological authority to maintain their position, while Hinduism created a psychological justification for it in the form of the cycle of reincarnation. A person&#x27;s position in the caste order was thought to have been determined by one&#x27;s actions in their past life. As a result, advancement of the soul and obeying the predetermined order were more important than seeking advancement in the material world, including economic advancement.

Weber ended his research of society and religion in India by bringing in insights from his previous work on China to discuss the similarities of the Asian belief systems. He noted that these religions&#x27; believers used otherworldly mystical experiences to interpret the meaning of life. The social world was fundamentally divided between the educated elite who followed the guidance of a prophet or wise man and the uneducated masses whose beliefs are centered on magic. In Asia, there were no messianic prophecies to give both educated and uneducated followers meaning in their regular lives. Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies, notably from the Near East, with the exemplary prophecies found in mainland Asia that focused more on reaching to the educated elites and enlightening them on the proper ways to live one&#x27;s life, usually with little emphasis on hard work and the material world. It was those differences that prevented Western countries from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilisations. His next work, &quot;Ancient Judaism&quot;, was an attempt to prove this theory.

====&quot;Ancient Judaism&quot;====
In &quot;Ancient Judaism&quot;, Weber attempted to explain the factors that resulted in the early differences between Eastern and Western religiosity. He contrasted the innerworldly asceticism developed by Western Christianity with the mystical contemplation that developed in India. Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections. This fundamental characteristic of Christianity originally stemmed from ancient Jewish prophecy. Weber classified the Jewish people as having been a pariah people, which meant that they were separated from the society that contained them. He examined the ancient Jewish people&#x27;s origins and social structures. In his view, the Israelites maintained order through a covenant with the war god Yahweh and the practice of warrior asceticism. Under Solomon, that changed into a more organised and law-based society than the old confederation was. Religiously, the priests replaced the previous charismatic religious leaders. Weber thought that Elijah was the first prophet to have risen from the shepherds. Elijah promulgated political prophecies and opposed the monarchy.

===Theodicy===
Weber used the concept of theodicy in his interpretation of theology and religion throughout his corpus. This involved both his scholarly and personal interests in the subject. It was central to his conception of humanity, which he interpreted as having been connected with finding meaning. Theodicy was a popular subject of study amongst German scholars who sought to determine how a world created by an omnibenevolent and omnipotent being can contain suffering. As part of this tradition, Weber was careful in his study of the subject. Rather than interpreting it through a theological or ethical lens, he interpreted it through a social one. Furthermore, he incorporated Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s concept of into his discussion of the topic. However, Weber disagreed with Nietzsche&#x27;s emotional discussion of the topic and his interpretation of it as having been a Jewish-derived expression of slave morality.

Weber divided theodicy into three main types:

# Persian dualism – God is not all powerful and misfortune comes from outside his power
# Indian doctrine of karma – God is not all powerful and misfortune comes from inside oneself
# Doctrine of predestination – Only a chosen few will be saved from damnation

Weber defined the importance of societal class within religion by examining the difference between the theodicies of fortune and misfortune and to what class structures they apply. The theodicy of fortune related to the desire of those who were successful to prove that they deserved it. They were also prone to not being satisfied with what they already had and wished to avoid the notion that they were illegitimate or sinful. Those without the work ethic believed in the theodicy of misfortune, believing wealth and happiness were granted in the afterlife. Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influenced class was that those of lower economic status tended towards deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future, while those of higher economic status preferred the sacraments or actions that proved their right to possess greater wealth.

===The state, politics, and government===
In political sociology, one of Weber&#x27;s most influential contributions is his lecture &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot;, in which he defined the state as an entity that was &quot;based on the legitimate use of force&quot;. Accordingly, Weber proposed that politics is the sharing of state power between various groups, whereas political leaders were those who wielded this power. He divided action into the oppositional and &quot;&quot; (the &quot;ethic of ultimate ends&quot; and the &quot;ethic of responsibility&quot;). An adherent of the justified their actions based on their consequences. Meanwhile, an adherent of the justified their actions based on their ideals. While Weber thought that both of them would ideally be present in a politician, he associated them with different types of people and mindsets. These different types of people and mindsets reflected the pacifists and those who wanted to reverse Germany&#x27;s defeat in the First World War, respectively.

Weber distinguished three ideal types of legitimate authority:
# Charismatic authority – Familial and religious
# Traditional authority – Patriarchy, patrimonialism, feudalism
# Rational-legal authority – Modern law and state, bureaucracy

In his view, all historical relationships between rulers and ruled contained these elements, which could be analysed on the basis of this tripartite classification of authority. Charismatic authority was held by extraordinary figures and was unstable, as it relied on the charismatic figure&#x27;s success and resisted institutionalisation. It was forced to be routinised into more structured forms of authority. An administrative structure would be formed by the charismatic leader&#x27;s followers. In an ideal type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a ruler led to a &quot;traditional revolution&quot;. Traditional authority was based on loyalty to preestablished traditions and those who were placed into authority as a result of those traditions. Rational-legal authority relied on bureaucracy and belief in both the legality of the society&#x27;s rules and the legitimacy of those who were placed into power as a result of those rules. Unlike the other types of authority, it gradually developed. That was the result of legal systems ability to exist without charismatic individuals or traditions.

====Bureaucracy====
Weber&#x27;s commentary on societal bureaucratisation is one of the most prominent parts of his work. According to him, bureaucracy was the most efficient method of societal organisation and the most formally rational system. It was necessary for modern society to function and would also be difficult to destroy. Bureaucratic officials felt superior to non-bureaucrats, had a strong sense of duty, and had fixed salaries that caused them to be disinclined to pursue monetary acquisition. Bureaucracy was less likely to be found among elected officials. Furthermore, Bureaucracy&#x27;s treatment of all people without regard for individuals suited capitalism well. It was also a requirement for both modern capitalism and modern socialism to exist. This depersonalisation related to its increased efficiency. Bureaucrats could not openly make decisions arbitrarily or base them on personal favours. As the most efficient and rational way of organising, bureaucratisation was the key part of rational-legal authority. Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalisation of Western society.

Weber listed six characteristics of an ideal type of bureaucracy:
# It was in a fixed area that was governed by rules
# Bureaucracies were hierarchical
# Its actions were based on written documents
# Expert training was required
# Bureaucrats were completely devoted to their work
# The system relied on basic rules that were learnable

The development of communication and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible and popularly requested. Meanwhile, the democratisation and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everyone equally. Weber&#x27;s ideal type of bureaucracy was characterised by hierarchical organisation, delineated lines of authority in a fixed area of activity, action taken on the basis of written rules, bureaucratic officials needing expert training, rules being implemented neutrally, and career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations. While arguing that bureaucracy was the most efficient form of organisation and was indispensable for the modern state, Weber was also critical of it. In his view, an inescapable bureaucratisation of society would happen in the future. He also thought that a hypothetical victory of socialism over capitalism would have not been able to prevent that. Economic and political organisations needed entrepreneurs and politicians in order to counteract bureaucrats. Otherwise, they would be stifled by bureaucracy.

====Social stratification====
Weber also formulated a three-component theory of stratification that contained the conceptually distinct elements of social class, social status, and political party. This distinction was most clearly described in his essay &quot;The Distribution of Power Within the : Classes, , Parties&quot;, which was first published in his book &quot;Economy and Society&quot;. Status served as one of the central ways in which people were ranked in society. As part of it, issues of honour and prestige were important. With regards to class, the theory placed heavy emphasis on class conflict and private property as having been key to its definition. While Weber drew upon Marx&#x27;s interpretation of class conflict in his definition of class, he did not see it as having defined all social relations and stratification. Political parties were not given as much attention by Weber as the other two components were, as he thought that they were not particularly effectual in their actions. Their purpose was to seek power to benefit their members materially or ideologically.

The three components of Weber&#x27;s theory were:
# Social class – Based on an economically determined relationship with the market
# Status () – Based on non-economic qualities such as honour and prestige
# Party – Affiliations in the political domain

This conceptualisation emerged from Weber&#x27;s study of farm labour and the stock exchange, as he found social relationships that were unexplainable through economic class alone. The Junkers had social rules regarding marriage between different social levels and farm labourers had a strong sense of independence, neither of which was economically based. Weber maintained a sharp distinction between the terms &quot;status&quot; and &quot;class&quot;, although non-scholars tend to use them interchangeably in casual use. Status and its focus on honour emerged from the , which denoted the part of society where loyalty originated from. Class emerged from the , a subdivision of the that included rationally driven markets and legal organisation. Parties emerged from a combination of the two. Weber interpreted life chances, the opportunities to improve one&#x27;s life, as having been a definitional aspect of class. It related to the differences in access to opportunities that different people might have had in their lives. The relationship between status and class was not straightforward. One of them could lead to the other, but an individual or group could have success in one but not the other.

===The vocation lectures===
Towards the end of his life, Weber gave two lectures, &quot;Science as a Vocation&quot; and &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot;, at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich that were on the subject of the scientific and political vocations. The Free Student Youth, a left-liberal student organisation, had invite him to give the lectures. In &quot;Science as a Vocation&quot;, he argued that an inner calling was necessary for one to become a scholar. Weber thought that only a particular type of person was able to have an academic career. He used his own career as an example of that. Recalling his arguments regarding the Protestant work ethic, Weber stated that the path forward in scholarship required the scholar to understand the potential for a lack of success and be methodical in their research. Specialisation was also an aspect of modern scholarship that a scholar needed to engage in. Disenchantment and intellectual rationalisation were major aspects of his commentary on the scholar&#x27;s role in modernity. These processes resulted in the value of scholarship being questioned. Weber argued that scholarship could provide certainty through its starting presumptions, despite its inability to give absolute answers. Meanwhile, &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot; commented on the subject of politics. Weber was responding to the early Weimar Republic&#x27;s political instability. He defined politics as having been divided into three aspects: passion, judgement, and responsibility. There was also a division between conviction and responsibility. While these two concepts were sharply divided, it was possible for single individualparticularly the ideal politicianto possess both of them. He also divided legitimate authority into the three categories of traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal authority. Towards the lecture&#x27;s end, he described politics as having been &quot;a slow, powerful drilling through hard boards&quot;. Ultimately, Weber thought that the political issues of his day required consistent effort to resolve, rather than the quick solutions that the students preferred.

===&quot;The City&quot;===


As part of his overarching effort to understand the Western world&#x27;s unique development, Weber wrote a general study of the European city and its development in antiquity and the Middle Ages titled &quot;The City&quot;. According to him, Christianity served to break the traditional bonds of kinship by causing its believers to participate in the religion as individuals. However, the institutions that formed as a result of this process were secular in nature. He also saw the rise of a unique form of non-legitimate domination in medieval European cities that successfully challenged the existing forms of legitimate dominationtraditional, charismatic, and rational-legalthat had prevailed until then in the medieval world. These cities were previously under the jurisdiction of several different entities that were removed as they became autonomous. That process was caused by the granting of privileges to newer cities and the usurpation of authority in older ones.

===Economics===
Weber primarily regarded himself as an economist, and all of his professorial appointments were in economics, but his contributions to that field were largely overshadowed by his role as a founder of modern sociology. As a political economist and economic historian, Weber belonged to the German historical school of economics, represented by academics such as Gustav von Schmoller and his student Werner Sombart. While Weber&#x27;s research interests were largely in line with this school, his views on methodology and marginal utility significantly diverged from those of the other German historicists. Instead, they were closer to those of Carl Menger and the Austrian school of economics, the traditional rivals of the historical school. The division caused by the caused Weber to support a broad interpretation of economics that combined economic theory, economic history, and economic sociology in the form of &quot;&quot; (&quot;social economics&quot;).

====&quot;Economy and Society&quot;====


Weber&#x27;s &quot;Economy and Society&quot; is an essay collection that he was working on at the time of his death in 1920. Its text was largely unfinished, outside of the first three chapters. The first four chapters were written between 1919 and 1920, but the other chapters were generally written between 1909 and 1914. After his death, the final organisation and editing of the book fell to his widow Marianne. She was assisted by the economist . The resulting volume was published in 1922 and was titled . The resulting volume included a wide range of essays dealing with Weber&#x27;s views regarding sociology, social philosophy, politics, social stratification, world religion, diplomacy, and other subjects. In 1956, the German jurist edited and organised a revised fourth edition of &quot;Economy and Society&quot;, later editing a fifth edition of it in 1976. Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich edited an English translation of the work in 1968. It was based on Winckelmann&#x27;s 1956 edition of the text that he had revised in 1964.

====Marginal utility====
Unlike other historicists, Weber accepted marginal utility and taught it to his students. His overall economic sociology was based on it. In 1908, Weber published an article, &quot;Marginal Utility Theory and &#x27;The Fundamental Law of Psychophysics&#x27;&quot;, in which he argued that marginal utility and economics were not based on psychology. As part of that, he disputed Lujo Brentano&#x27;s claim that marginal utility reflected the form of the psychological response to stimuli as described by the Weber–Fechner law. He rejected the idea that marginal utility and economics were dependent on psychophysics. In general, Weber disagreed with the idea that economics relied on another field. He also included a similar discussion of marginal utility in the second chapter of &quot;Economy and Society&quot;. Both marginal utility and declining utility&#x27;s roles in his writings were implied through his usage of instrumentally rational action in that chapter.

====Economic calculation====
Like his colleague Werner Sombart, Weber regarded economic calculation, particularly double-entry bookkeeping, as having played a significant role in rationalisation and the development of capitalism. Weber&#x27;s preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to critique socialism as lacking a mechanism to efficiently allocate resources to satisfy human needs. Otto Neurath, a socialist thinker, thought that prices would not exist and central planners would use in-kind, rather than monetary, economic calculation in a completely socialised economy. According to Weber, this type of coordination was inefficient because it was incapable of solving the problem of imputation, which related to the difficulties in accurately determining the relative values of capital goods. Weber wrote that the value of goods had to be determined in a socialist economy. However, there was no clear method for doing so in that economic system. Planned economies were, therefore, irrational. At approximately the same time, Ludwig von Mises independently made the same argument against socialism. Weber himself had a significant influence on Mises, whom he had befriended when they were both at the University of Vienna in the spring of 1918. However, Mises ultimately regarded him as having been a historian, rather than an economist.

==Inspirations==
Weber was strongly influenced by German idealism, particularly by neo-Kantianism. He was exposed to it by Heinrich Rickert, who was his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. The neo-Kantian belief that reality was essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from the way the human mind focused its attention on certain aspects of reality and organised the resulting perceptions was particularly important to Weber&#x27;s scholarship. His opinions regarding social scientific methodology showed parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel. Weber was also influenced by Kantian ethics more generally, but he came to think of it as being obsolete in a modern age that lacked religious certainties. His interpretation of Kant and neo-Kantianism was pessimistic as a result.

Weber was responding to Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy&#x27;s effect on modern thought. His goal in the field of ethics was to find non-arbitrarily defined freedom in what he interpreted as having been a post-metaphysical age. That represented a division between the parts of his thought that represented Kantianism and Nietzscheanism. After his debate with Oswald Spengler in 1920, Weber said that the world was significantly intellectually influenced by Nietzsche and Marx. In &quot;The Protestant Work Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; and &quot;Science as a Vocation&quot;, Weber negatively described &quot;&quot; (&quot;the &#x27;last men&#x27;&quot;), who were Nietzschean &quot;specialists without spirit&quot; who he warned about in both texts. Similarly, he also used Nietzsche&#x27;s concept of in his discussion of theodicy, but he interpreted it differently. Weber disliked Nietzsche&#x27;s emotional approach to the subject and did not interpret it as having been a type of slave morality that was derived from Judaism.

While a student in Charlottenburg, Weber read all forty volumes by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who later exerted an influence over his methodology and concepts. For him, Goethe was one of the seminal figures in German history. In his writings, including &quot;The Protestant Work Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;, Weber quoted Goethe on several occasions. His usage of &quot;elective affinity&quot; in his writings may have been derived from Goethe, as one of Goethe&#x27;s works used it as its title. Weber was also influenced by Goethe&#x27;s usage of the Greek (&quot;fate&quot;). That concept influenced Weber&#x27;s perspective that one&#x27;s fate was inevitable and that one was able to use experience to create intellectual passion. He thought that Goethe, his Faust, and Nietzsche&#x27;s Zarathustra were figures that represented the and expressed the quality of human action by ceaselessly striving for knowledge.

Another major influence in Weber&#x27;s life was the writings of Karl Marx and socialist thought in academia and active politics. While Weber agreed with Marx on the importance of social conflict, he did not think that it would destroy a society if the traditions that upheld it were valued more than it was. Furthermore, he thought that a social conflict would have been resolvable within the preexisting social system. Writing in 1932, Karl Löwith contrasted the work of Marx and Weber, arguing that both were interested in the causes and effects of Western capitalism, but they viewed it through different lenses. Marx viewed capitalism through the lens of alienation, while Weber used the concept of rationalisation to interpret it. Weber also expanded Marx&#x27;s interpretation of alienation from the specific idea of the worker who was alienated from his work to similar situations that involved intellectuals and bureaucrats. Scholars during the Cold War frequently interpreted Weber as having been &quot;a bourgeois answer to Marx&quot;, but he was instead responding to the issues that were relevant to the bourgeoisie in Wilhelmine Germany. In that regard, he focused on the conflict between rationality and irrationality.

==Legacy==
Weber&#x27;s most influential work was on economic sociology, political sociology, and the sociology of religion. Along with Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim, he is commonly regarded as one of the founders of modern sociology. He was instrumental in developing an antipositivist, hermeneutic, tradition in the social sciences. Weber influenced many scholars across the political spectrum. Left-leaning social theoristssuch as Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer, György Lukács, and Jürgen Habermaswere influenced by his discussion of modernity and its friction with modernisation. As part of that, his analysis of modernity and rationalisation significantly influenced the Frankfurt School&#x27;s critical theory. Right-leaning scholarsincluding Carl Schmitt, Joseph Schumpeter, Leo Strauss, Hans Morgenthau, and Raymond Aronemphasised different elements of his thought. They placed importance on his discussion of strong leaders in democracy, political ethics&#x27; relationship with value-freedom and value-relativism, and using political action to combat bureaucracy. The scholars who have examined his works philosophically, including Strauss, Hans Henrik Bruun, and Alfred Schütz, have traditionally looked at them through the lens of Continental philosophy.

===Weber studies===
Weberian scholarship&#x27;s beginnings were delayed by the disruption of academic life in the Weimar Republic. Hyper-inflation caused Weber&#x27;s support for parliamentary democracy to be countered by the decline the respect that professors had for it. The alienation that they experienced from politics caused many of them to become pessimistic and closer to the historical viewpoints espoused by Oswald Spengler in his &quot;The Decline of the West&quot;. Furthermore, universities increasingly came under state control and influence. After the Nazi Party took power, that process accelerated. The previously dominant style of sociology, that of Alfred Vierkandt and Leopold von Wiese, was largely replaced by a sociology that was dominated by support for the Nazis. Hans Freyer and Othmar Spann were representative of that movement, while Werner Sombart began to support collectivism and Nazism. The Nazi Party&#x27;s rise had relegated Weber&#x27;s scholarship to a marginal position in the Germany academy. However, some Weberian scholars had left Germany while this was happening, with most of them settling in the United States and the United Kingdom.

These scholars began to involve themselves in American and British scholarship at a time when Weber&#x27;s writings, such as the &quot;General Economic History&quot;, were beginning to be translated into English. Talcott Parsons, an American scholar, was influenced by his readings of Weber and Sombart as a student in Germany during the 1920s. He obtained permission from Marianne Weber to publish a translation of &quot;The Protestant Work Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; in his 1930 essay collection, the &quot;Collected Essays on the Sociology of Religion&quot;. This translated version, which was heavily edited by the publisher, was not initially successful. Parsons used this translation as part of his effort to create an academic sociology, which resulted in his 1937 book &quot;The Structure of Social Action&quot;. In it, Parsons argued that Weber and Durkheim were foundational sociologists. However, his book was not successful until after the Second World War. He then published a translation of &quot;Economy and Society&quot; as &quot;The Theory of Social and Economic Organization&quot;. Parsons&#x27;s increasing scholarly prominence led to this volume&#x27;s own elevated influence. Other translations began to appear, including C. Wright Mills and &quot;From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology&quot; in 1946. Their volume was a collection of excerpts from Weber&#x27;s writings. In the last year of the decade, Edward Shils edited a translation of Weber&#x27;s &quot;Collected Essays on Methodology&quot;, which was published as &quot;The Methodology of the Social Sciences&quot;.

As the 1940s ended, Weber&#x27;s scholarly reputation rose as a result of scholarly interpretations of it through the lenses of Parsons&#x27;s structural functionalism and Mills&#x27;s conflict theory. Over the course of the following decades, continued publications of translated versions of Weber&#x27;s works began to appear, including ones on law, religion, music, and the city. Despite the translations&#x27; flaws, it became possible to obtain a largely complete view of Weber&#x27;s scholarship. That was still impeded by the unorganised publishing of the translations, which prevented scholars from knowing the connections between the different texts. In 1968, a complete translation of Marianne Weber&#x27;s prepared version of &quot;Economy and Society&quot; was published. While an interpretation of Weber that was separate from Parson&#x27;s structural functionalism had begun with &quot;From Max Weber&quot;, a more political and historical interpretation was forwarded by Reinhard Bendix&#x27;s 1948 &quot;Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait&quot;, Ralf Dahrendorf&#x27;s 1957 &quot;Class and Conflict in an Industrial Society&quot;, and John Rex&#x27;s 1962 &quot;Key Problems in Sociological Theory&quot;. Raymond Aron&#x27;s interpretation of Weber in his 1965 text, &quot;Main Currents in Sociological Thought&quot;, gave an alternative to Parson&#x27;s perspective on the history of sociology. Weber, while still integral to it, was being framed as one of the three foundational figures, the other two were Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim. Anthony Giddens solidified that interpretation of them with the publication of his &quot;Capitalism and Modern Social Theory&quot; in 1971. After the end of the 1970s, more of Weber&#x27;s less prominent publications were published. That effort coincided with the continued writing of critical commentaries on his works and idea, including the creation of a scholarly journal in 2000, &quot;Max Weber Studies&quot;, that is devoted to such scholarship.
The idea of publishing a collected edition of Weber&#x27;s complete works was pushed forward by Horst Baier in 1972. A year later, the &quot;&quot;, a multi-volume set of all of his writings, began to take shape. Wolfgang J. Mommsen, Wolfgang Schluchter, , M. Rainer Lepsius, and were the initial editors. After Mommsen&#x27;s death in 2004, succeeded him. Winckelmann, Lepsius, and Baier also died before the completion of the project. The writings were organised in a combination of chronological order and by subject, with the material that was not intended to be published by Weber in purely chronological order. The final editions of each text were used, with the exception of &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;, which was published in both its first and final forms. Mohr Siebeck was selected to publish the volumes. The project was presented to the academic community in 1981 with the publication of a prospectus that was colloquially referred to as the &quot;green brochure&quot;. It outlined the three sections of the series: &quot;Writings and Speeches&quot;, &quot;Letters&quot;, and &quot;Lecture Manuscripts and Lecture Notes&quot;. Four years later, the project entered publication. It concluded in June 2020 and contains forty-seven volumes, including two index volumes.

<text>Max Horkheimer ( ; ; 14 February 1895 – 7 July 1973) was a German philosopher and sociologist who was famous for his work in critical theory as a member of the Frankfurt School of social research. Horkheimer addressed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis, and the poverty of mass culture using the philosophy of history as a framework. This became the foundation of critical theory. His most important works include &quot;Eclipse of Reason&quot; (1947), &quot;Between Philosophy and Social Science&quot; (1930–1938) and, in collaboration with Theodor Adorno, &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; (1947). Through the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer planned, supported and made other significant works possible.

==Biography==
===Early life===
On 14 February 1895, Horkheimer was born the only son of Moritz and Babetta Horkheimer. Horkheimer was born into a conservative, wealthy Orthodox Jewish family. His father was a successful businessman who owned several textile factories in the Zuffenhausen district of Stuttgart, where Max was born. Moritz expected his son to follow in his footsteps and own the family business.

Max was taken out of school in 1910 to work in the family business, where he eventually became a junior manager. During this period he would begin two relationships that would last for the rest of his life. First, he met Friedrich Pollock, who would later become a close academic colleague, and who would remain Max&#x27;s closest friend. He also met Rose Riekher, his father&#x27;s personal secretary. Eight years Max&#x27;s senior, a Christian, and from a lower economic class, Riekher (whom Max called &quot;Maidon&quot;) was not considered a suitable match by Moritz Horkheimer. Despite this, Max and Maidon would marry in 1926 and remain together until her death in 1969.

In 1917, his manufacturing career ended and his chances of taking over his family business were interrupted when he was drafted into World War I. However, Horkheimer avoided service, being rejected on medical grounds.

===Education===
In the spring of 1919, after failing an army physical, Horkheimer enrolled at Munich University. While living in Munich, he was mistaken for the revolutionary playwright Ernst Toller and arrested and imprisoned.

After being released, Horkheimer moved to Frankfurt am Main, where he studied philosophy and psychology under Hans Cornelius. There, he met Theodor Adorno, several years his junior, with whom he would strike a lasting friendship and a collaborative relationship. After an abortive attempt at writing a dissertation on gestalt psychology, Horkheimer, with Cornelius&#x27;s direction, completed his doctorate in philosophy with a 78-page dissertation titled &quot;The Antinomy of Teleological Judgment&quot; ().

In 1925, Horkheimer was habilitated with a dissertation entitled &quot;Kant&#x27;s Critique of Judgment as Mediation between Practical and Theoretical Philosophy&quot; (). Here, he met Friedrich Pollock, who would be his colleague at the Institute of Social Research. The following year, Max was appointed &quot;Privatdozent.&quot; Shortly after, in 1926, Horkheimer married Rose Riekher.

===Institute of Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung)===
In 1926, Horkheimer was an &quot;unsalaried lecturer in Frankfurt.&quot; Shortly after, in 1930, he was promoted to professor of philosophy at Frankfurt University. In the same year, when the Institute for Social Research&#x27;s (now known as Frankfurt School of Critical Theory) directorship became vacant, after the departure of Carl Grünberg, Horkheimer was elected to the position &quot;by means of an endowment from a wealthy businessman&quot;. The Institute had had its beginnings in a Marxist study group started by Felix Weil, a one-time student of political science at Frankfurt who used his inheritance to fund the group as a way to support his leftist academic aims. Pollock and Horkheimer were partners with Weil in the early activities of the institute.

Horkheimer worked to make the Institute a purely academic enterprise. As director, he changed the institute from an orthodox Marxist school to a heterodox school for critical social research. The following year publication of the institute&#x27;s &quot;Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung&quot; began, with Horkheimer as its editor.

Horkheimer intellectually reoriented the institute, proposing a programme of collective research aimed at specific social groups (specifically the working class) that would highlight the problem of the relationship of history and reason. The Institute focused on integrating the views of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. The Frankfurt School attempted this by systematically hitching together the different conceptual structures of historical materialism and psychoanalysis.

During the time between Horkheimer&#x27;s being named Professor of Social Philosophy and director of the Institute in 1930, the Nazi party became the second largest party in the Reichstag. In the midst of the violence surrounding the Nazis&#x27; rise, Horkheimer and his associates began to prepare for the possibility of moving the Institute out of Germany. Horkheimer&#x27;s &quot;venia legendi&quot; was revoked by the new Nazi government because of the Marxian nature of the institute&#x27;s ideas as well as its prominent Jewish association. When Hitler was named the Chancellor in 1933, the institute was thus forced to close its location in Germany.

He emigrated to Geneva, Switzerland, and then to New York City the following year, where Horkheimer met with the president of Columbia University, Nicholas Murray Butler, to discuss hosting the institute. To Horkheimer&#x27;s surprise, the president agreed to host the Institute in exile as well as offer Horkheimer a building for the institute. In July 1934, Horkheimer accepted an offer from Columbia to relocate the institute to one of their buildings.

In 1940, Horkheimer received American citizenship and moved to the Pacific Palisades district of Los Angeles, California, where his collaboration with Adorno would yield the &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment.&quot; In 1942, Horkheimer assumed the directorship of the Scientific Division of the American Jewish Committee. In this capacity, he helped launch and organize a series of five Studies in Prejudice, which were published in 1949 and 1950. The most important of these was the pioneering study in social psychology entitled &quot;The Authoritarian Personality&quot;, itself a methodologically advanced reworking of some of the themes treated in a collective project produced by the Institute in its first years of exile, Studies in Authority and Family.

In the years that followed, Horkheimer did not publish much, although he continued to edit &quot;Studies in Philosophy and Social Science&quot; as a continuation of the &quot;Zeitschrift.&quot; In 1949, he returned to Frankfurt where the Institute for Social Research reopened in 1950. Between 1951 and 1953 Horkheimer was rector of the University of Frankfurt. In 1953, Horkheimer stepped down from director of the Institute and took on a smaller role in the institute, while Adorno became director.

===Later years===
Horkheimer continued to teach at the university until his retirement in the mid-1960s. In 1953, he was awarded the Goethe Plaque of the City of Frankfurt, and was later named an honorary citizen of Frankfurt for life. He returned to the United States in 1954 and 1959 to lecture as a frequent visiting professor at the University of Chicago. In the late 1960s, Horkheimer supported Pope Paul VI&#x27;s stand against artificial contraception, specifically the pill, arguing that it would lead to the end of romantic love.

===Legacy===
He remained an important figure until his death in Nuremberg in 1973. Max Horkheimer with the help of Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Leo Lowenthal, Otto Kirchheimer, Frederick Pollock and Franz Neumann developed &quot;Critical Theory&quot;. According to Larry Ray &quot;Critical Theory&quot; has &quot;become one of the most influential social theories of the twentieth century&quot;.

==Thought==

Horkheimer&#x27;s work is marked by a concern to show the relation between affect (especially suffering) and concepts (understood as action-guiding expressions of reason). In that, he responded critically to what he saw as the one-sidedness of both neo-Kantianism (with its focus on concepts) and &quot;Lebensphilosophie&quot; (with its focus on expression and world-disclosure). He did not think that either was wrong, but he insisted that the insights of each school on its own could not adequately contribute to the repair of social problems. Horkheimer focused on the connections between social structures, networks/subcultures and individual realities and concluded that we are affected and shaped by the proliferation of products on the marketplace. It is also important to note that Horkheimer collaborated with Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno, and Walter Benjamin.

===Critical theory===
Through critical theory, a social theory focusing on critiquing and changing society, Horkheimer &quot;attempted to revitalize radical social, and cultural criticism&quot; and discussed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis and the poverty of mass culture. Horkheimer helped to create critical theory through a mix of radical and conservative lenses that stem from radical Marxism and end up in &quot;pessimistic Jewish transcendentalism&quot;.

He developed his critical theory by examining his own wealth while witnessing the juxtaposition of the bourgeois and the impoverished. This critical theory embraced the future possibilities of society and was preoccupied with forces which moved society toward rational institutions that would ensure a true, free, and just life. He was convinced of the need to &quot;examine the entire material and spiritual culture of mankind&quot; in order to transform society as a whole. Horkheimer sought to enable the working class to reclaim their power in order to resist the lure of fascism. Horkheimer stated himself that &quot;the rationally organized society that regulates its own existence&quot; was necessary along with a society that could &quot;satisfy common needs&quot;. To satisfy these needs, it reached out for a total understanding of history and knowledge. Through this, critical theory develops a &quot;critique of bourgeois society through which &#x27;ideology critique&#x27; attempted to locate the &#x27;utopian content&#x27; of dominant systems of thought&quot;. Above all, critical theory sought to develop a critical perspective in the discussion of all social practices.

=== Writing ===
====&quot;Between Philosophy and Social Science&quot;====
&quot;Between Philosophy and Social Science&quot; appeared between 1930 and 1938, during the time the Frankfurt school moved from Frankfurt to Geneva to Columbia University. It included: &quot;Materialism and Morality&quot;, &quot;The Present Situation of Moral Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social Research&quot;, &quot;On the Problem of Truth&quot;, &quot;Egoism and the Freedom Movement&quot;, &quot;History and Psychology&quot;, &quot;A New Concept of Ideology&quot;, &quot;Remarks on Philosophical Anthropology&quot;, and &quot;The Rationalism Debate in Contemporary Philosophy&quot;. It also included &quot;The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research&quot;, &quot;Egoism and Freedom Movements&quot; and &quot;Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History&quot;. The essays within &quot;Between Philosophy and Social Science&quot; were Horkheimer&#x27;s attempts to &quot;remove the individual from mass culture, a function for philosophy from the commodification of everything&quot;. Horkheimer was extremely invested in the individual. In one of his writings, he states, &quot;When we speak of an individual as a historical entity, we mean not merely the space-time and the sense existence of a particular member of the human race, but in addition, his awareness of his own individuality as a conscious human being, including recognition of his own identity.&quot;

&quot;The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research&quot; was not only included in this volume, but it was also used as Horkheimer&#x27;s inaugural speech as director of the Frankfurt School. In this speech he related economic groups to the struggles and challenges of real life. Horkheimer often referenced human struggle and used this example in his speech because it was a topic he understood well.

&quot;Egoism and Freedom Movements&quot; and &quot;Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History&quot; are the longest of the essays. The first is an evaluation of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Vico; the latter discusses the bourgeois control. In Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History, Horkheimer explained &quot;what he learned from the bourgeois rise to power and what of the bourgeois he thought was worth preserving.

The volume also looks at the individual as the &quot;troubled center of philosophy.&quot; Horkheimer expressed that &quot;there is no formula that defines the relationship among individuals, society and nature for all time&quot;. To understand the problem of the individual further, Horkheimer included two case studies on the individual: one on Montaigne and one on himself.

==== &quot;Eclipse of Reason&quot; ====

Horkheimer&#x27;s book, &quot;Eclipse of Reason&quot;, started in 1941 and published in 1947, is broken into five sections: Means and Ends, Conflicting Panaceas, The Revolt of Nature, The Rise and Decline of the Individual, and On the Concept of Philosophy. The &quot;Eclipse of Reason&quot; focuses on the concept of reason within the history of Western philosophy, which can only be fostered in an environment of free, critical thinking while also linking positivist and instrumental reason with the rise of fascism. He distinguishes between objective, subjective and instrumental reason, and states that we have moved from the former through the center and into the latter (though subjective and instrumental reason are closely connected). Objective reason deals with universal truths that dictate that an action is either right or wrong. It is a concrete concept and a force in the world that requires specific modes of behavior. The focus in the objective faculty of reason is on the ends, rather than the means. Subjective reason is an abstract concept of reason, and focuses primarily on means. Specifically, the reasonable nature of the purpose of action is irrelevant – the ends only serve the purpose of the subject (generally self-advancement or preservation). To be &quot;reasonable&quot; in this context is to be suited to a particular purpose, to be &quot;good for something else&quot;. This aspect of reason is universally conforming, and easily furnishes ideology. In instrumental reason, the sole criterion of reason is its operational value or purposefulness, and with this, the idea of truth becomes contingent on mere subjective preference (hence the relation with subjective reason). Because subjective/instrumental reason rules, the ideals of a society, for example democratic ideals, become dependent on the &quot;interests&quot; of the people instead of being dependent on objective truths. Horkheimer writes, &quot;Social power is today more than ever mediated by power over things. The more intense an individual&#x27;s concern with power over things, the more will things dominate him, the more will he lack any genuine individual traits, and the more will his mind be transformed into an automation of formalized reason.&quot;

Horkheimer acknowledges that objective reason has its roots in Reason (&quot;Logos&quot; in Greek) and concludes, &quot;If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate – in short, the emancipation from fear – then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service we can render.&quot;

==== &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; ====

Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno collaborated to publish &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot;, which was originally published in 1944. The inspiration for this piece came from when Horkheimer and Adorno had to flee Germany, because of Hitler, and go to New York. They went to America and &quot;absorbed the popular culture&quot;; thinking that it was a form of totalitarianism. Nonetheless, Dialectic of Enlightenment&#x27;s main argument was to serve as a wide-ranging critique of the &quot;self-destruction of enlightenment&quot;. The work criticized popular culture as &quot;the product of a culture industry whose goal was to stupefy the masses with endless mass produced copies of the same thing&quot; (Lemert). Along with that, Horkheimer and Adorno had a few arguments; one being that these mass-produced products only appear to change over time. Horkheimer and Adorno stated that these products were so standardized in order to help consumers comprehend and appreciate the products with little attention given to them. They expressed, &quot;the result is a constant reproduction of the same thing&quot; (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1993 [1944]). However, they also explain how pseudo-individuality is encouraged among these products in order to keep the consumers coming back for more. They argue that small differences in products within the same area are acceptable.

The similar patterns found in the content of popular culture (films, popular songs and radio) have the same central message; &quot;it&#x27;s all linked to &quot;the necessity of obedience of the masses to the social hierarchy in place in advanced capitalist societies&quot;. These products appeal to the masses and encourage conformity to the consumers. In return, capitalism remains in power while buyers continue to consume from the industry. This is dangerous because the consumers&#x27; belief that the powers of technology are liberating, starts to increase. To support their claim, Horkheimer and Adorno, &quot;proposed an antidote: not just thinking the relations of &quot;things&quot;, but also, as an immediate second step, thinking &quot;through&quot; that thinking, self-reflexively.&quot; In other words, technology lacks self-reflexivity. Nonetheless, Horkheimer and Adorno believed that art was an exception, because it &quot;is an open-ended system with no fixed rules&quot;; thus, it could not be an object of the industry.

==Criticisms==
Perry Anderson sees Horkheimer&#x27;s attempt to make the Institute purely academic as &quot;symptomatic of a more universal process, the emergence of a &#x27;Western Marxism&#x27; divorced from the working-class movement and dominated by academic philosophers and the &#x27;product of defeat because of the isolation of the Russian Revolution. Rolf Wiggershaus, author of &quot;The Frankfurt School&quot; believed Horkheimer lacked the audacious theoretical construction produced by those like Marx and Lukács and that his main argument was that those living in misery had the right to material egoism. In his book, &quot;Social Theory&quot;, Alex Callinicos claims that &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; offers no systematic account of conception of rationality, but rather professes objective reason intransigently to an extent. Charles Lemert discusses in his book &quot;Social Theory&quot; that in writing &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot;, Horkheimer and Adorno lack sufficient sympathy for the cultural plight of the average working person, unfair to criticize the tastes of ordinary people, and that popular culture does not really buttress social conformity and stabilize capitalism as much as the Frankfurt school thinks.

Ingar Solty, in a February 2020 &quot;Jacobin&quot; magazine article, notes that the work of Horkheimer, Adorno, and the Frankfurt School as a whole is marked by &quot;the vast historical defeats suffered by the interwar socialist movement.&quot; He notes, &quot;Horkheimer and Adorno thus became increasingly pessimistic with regards to the working class&#x27;s ability to overthrow capitalism ... Horkheimer did not conduct empirical research on capitalism and its crises ... the hierarchical nature of the international division of labor, the organization of internationalizing capitalism in a system of nation-states, the origins of imperialism and inter-imperial rivalries, or such ... For Horkheimer, the working class had been a revolutionary subject only in the abstract ... [it] was essentially an empty placeholder for the subject which would overthrow an economic and social system which they considered wrong. If it failed to live up to its expectations, then it could easily be replaced by another subject of revolution—or the conclusion that there was no way out (of capitalism).&quot;

Solty contextualizes Horkheimer&#x27;s (and, by implication, the Frankfurt School&#x27;s) &quot;return from &#x27;revolutionary optimism&#x27; to &#x27;revolutionary pessimism by noting, &quot;[m]any postwar radical leftists and anti-capitalists, especially those not organized in real workers&#x27; parties, were disappointed revolutionaries. The German writer Alfred Andersch, who had been close to the KPD before 1933 and then withdrawn into &quot;inner emigration,&quot; called the West German postwar left a &quot;homeless left.&quot; The working classes&#x27; betrayals seemed to continue after 1945. After the short-lived socialist revival, the Cold War and the internationalization of the New Deal as the Keynesian welfare state seemed to have completely absorbed what was left of revolutionary working-class spirit. This led many disappointed leftists to culture and ideology as levels of analyses which could explain this failure of the working class.&quot; Solty identifies Horkheimer&#x27;s (and, implicitly, the Frankfurt School&#x27;s) work as an important influence on that of Michel Foucault:Ultimately, both Horkheimer and Foucault only considered the defense of remaining elements of freedom and the identification of &quot;micro-powers&quot; of domination a possibility, but changes in the macro-power structures were out of reach. In other words, a Left was born that was no longer oriented toward &quot;counter-hegemony&quot; (as per Antonio Gramsci), as a way of building toward power, but rather &quot;anti-hegemony&quot; (Horkheimer, Foucault, etc.), as John Sanbonmatsu put it in his critique of postmodernism.

<text>Myanmar, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and also rendered as Burma (the official English form until 1989), is a country in northwest Southeast Asia. It is the largest country by area in Mainland Southeast Asia and has a population of about 55 million. It is bordered by India and Bangladesh to its northwest, China to its northeast, Laos and Thailand to its east and southeast, and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its south and southwest. The country&#x27;s capital city is Naypyidaw, and its largest city is Yangon (formerly Rangoon).

Early civilisations in the area included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Myanmar and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Myanmar. In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley, and following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, the Burmese language and culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country. The Pagan Kingdom fell to Mongol invasions, and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the Taungoo dynasty, the country became the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a short period. The early 19th-century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Assam, the Lushai Hills, and Manipur as well. The British East India Company seized control of the administration of Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century, and the country became a British colony. After a brief Japanese occupation, Myanmar was reconquered by the Allies. On 4 January 1948, Myanmar declared independence under the terms of the Burma Independence Act 1947.

Myanmar&#x27;s post-independence history has been checkered by continuing unrest and conflict to this day. The coup d&#x27;état in 1962 resulted in a military dictatorship under the Burma Socialist Programme Party. On 8 August 1988, the 8888 Uprising then resulted in a nominal transition to a multi-party system two years later, but the country&#x27;s post-uprising military council refused to cede power, and has continued to rule the country through to the present. The country remains riven by ethnic strife among its myriad ethnic groups and has one of the world&#x27;s longest-running ongoing civil wars. The United Nations and several other organisations have reported consistent and systemic human rights violations in the country. In 2011, the military junta was officially dissolved following a 2010 general election, and a nominally civilian government was installed. Aung San Suu Kyi and political prisoners were released and the 2015 Myanmar general election was held, leading to improved foreign relations and eased economic sanctions, although the country&#x27;s treatment of its ethnic minorities, particularly in connection with the Rohingya conflict, continued to be a source of international tension and consternation. Following the 2020 Myanmar general election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi’s party won a clear majority in both houses, the Burmese military (Tatmadaw) again seized power in a coup d&#x27;état. The coup, which was widely condemned by the international community, led to continuous ongoing widespread protests in Myanmar and has been marked by violent political repression by the military, as well as a larger outbreak of the civil war. The military also arrested Aung San Suu Kyi in order to remove her from public life, and charged her with crimes ranging from corruption to violation of COVID-19 protocols; all of the charges against her are &quot;politically motivated&quot; according to independent observers.

Myanmar is a member of the East Asia Summit, Non-Aligned Movement, ASEAN, and BIMSTEC, but it is not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations despite once being part of the British Empire. Myanmar is a Dialogue Partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The country is very rich in natural resources, such as jade, gems, oil, natural gas, teak and other minerals, as well as endowed with renewable energy, having the highest solar power potential compared to other countries of the Great Mekong Subregion. However, Myanmar has long suffered from instability, factional violence, corruption, poor infrastructure, as well as a long history of colonial exploitation with little regard to human development. In 2013, its GDP (nominal) stood at US$56.7 billion and its GDP (PPP) at US$221.5 billion. The income gap in Myanmar is among the widest in the world, as a large proportion of the economy is controlled by cronies of the military junta. Myanmar is one of the least developed countries. Since 2021, more than 600,000 people were displaced across Myanmar due to the civil war post-coup, with more than three million people in dire need of humanitarian assistance. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are over 1.3 million people counted as refugees and asylum seekers, and 3.5 million people displaced internally as of December 2024.

== Etymology ==

The name of the country has been a matter of dispute and disagreement, particularly in the early 21st century, focusing mainly on the political legitimacy of those using &quot;Myanmar&quot; versus &quot;Burma&quot;. Both names derive from the earlier Burmese &quot;Mranma&quot; or &quot;Mramma&quot;, an ethnonym for the majority Burman ethnic group, of uncertain etymology. The terms are also popularly thought to derive from Sanskrit &quot;Brahma Desha&quot;, &#x27;land of Brahma&#x27;.

In 1989, the military government officially changed the English translations of many names dating back to Burma&#x27;s colonial period or earlier, including that of the country itself: &quot;Burma&quot; became &quot;Myanmar&quot;. The renaming remains a contested issue. Many political and ethnic opposition groups and countries continue to use &quot;Burma&quot; because they do not recognise the legitimacy or authority of the military government.

The country&#x27;s official full name is &quot;Republic of the Union of Myanmar&quot; (, &#x27;, ). Countries that do not officially recognise that name use the long form &quot;Union of Burma&quot; instead. In English, the country is popularly known as either &quot;Burma&quot; or &quot;Myanmar&quot;. In Burmese, the pronunciation depends on the register used and is either &#x27; () or &quot;&quot; ().

Official United States foreign policy retains &quot;Burma&quot; as the country&#x27;s name although the State Department&#x27;s website lists the country as &quot;Burma (Myanmar)&quot;. The United Nations uses &quot;Myanmar&quot;, as does the ASEAN and as do Australia, Russia, Germany, China, India, Bangladesh, Norway, Japan, Switzerland, Canada and Ukraine. Most English-speaking international news media refer to the country by the name &quot;Myanmar&quot;, including the BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, Reuters, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)/Radio Australia. Myanmar is known by a name deriving from &quot;Burma&quot; in Spanish, Italian, Romanian, and Greek. French-language media consistently use &quot;Birmanie&quot;.

There are at least nine different pronunciations of the English name &quot;Myanmar&quot;, and no single one is standard. Pronunciations with two syllables are found most often in major British and American dictionaries. Dictionaries—such as Collins—and other sources also report pronunciations with three syllables.

As John Wells explains, the English spellings of both Myanmar and Burma assume a non-rhotic variety of English, in which the letter r before a consonant or finally serves merely to indicate a long vowel: . So the pronunciation of the last syllable of Myanmar as by some speakers in the UK and most speakers in North America is in fact a spelling pronunciation based on a misunderstanding of non-rhotic spelling conventions. However, &quot;Burma&quot; is pronounced by rhotic speakers of English due to a phonotactic constraint, as occurs only before in those accents.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===

Archaeological evidence shows that &quot;Homo erectus&quot; lived in the region now known as Myanmar as early as 750,000 years ago, with no more &quot;erectus&quot; finds after 75,000 years ago. The first evidence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; is dated to about 25,000 BP with discoveries of stone tools in central Myanmar. Evidence of Neolithic age domestication of plants and animals and the use of polished stone tools dating to sometime between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE has been discovered in the form of cave paintings in Padah-Lin Caves.

The Bronze Age arrived when people in the region were turning copper into bronze, growing rice and domesticating poultry and pigs; they were among the first people in the world to do so. Human remains and artefacts from this era were discovered in Monywa District in the Sagaing Region. The Iron Age began around 500 BCE with the emergence of iron-working settlements in an area south of present-day Mandalay. Evidence also shows the presence of rice-growing settlements of large villages and small towns that traded with their surroundings as far as China between 500 BCE and 200 CE. Iron Age Burmese cultures also had influences from outside sources such as India and Thailand, as seen in their funerary practices concerning child burials. This indicates some form of communication between groups in Myanmar and other places, possibly through trade.

=== Early city-states ===

Around the second century BCE the first-known city-states emerged in central Myanmar. The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of Myanmar of whom records are extant, from present-day Yunnan. The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India, importing Buddhism as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on later Burmese culture and political organisation.

By the 9th century, several city-states had sprouted across the land: the Pyu in the central dry zone, Mon along the southern coastline and Arakanese along the western littoral. The balance was upset when the Pyu came under repeated attacks from Nanzhao between the 750s and the 830s. In the mid-to-late 9th century the Bamar people founded a small settlement at Bagan. It was one of several competing city-states until the late 10th century, when it grew in authority and grandeur.

=== Pagan Kingdom ===


Pagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s–1060s when Anawrahta founded the Pagan Kingdom, the first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Pagan Empire and the Khmer Empire were two main powers in mainland Southeast Asia. The Burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the Pyu, Mon and Pali norms by the late 12th century. Theravada Buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level, although Tantric, Mahayana, Hinduism, and folk religion remained heavily entrenched. Pagan&#x27;s rulers and wealthy built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone alone. Repeated Mongol invasions in the late 13th century toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287.
Pagan&#x27;s collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century. Like the Burmans four centuries earlier, Shan migrants who arrived with the Mongol invasions stayed behind. Several competing Shan States came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley. The valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two sizeable powers, Ava Kingdom and Hanthawaddy Kingdom, emerged. In the west, a politically fragmented Arakan was under competing influences of its stronger neighbours until the Kingdom of Mrauk U unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437. The kingdom was a protectorate of the Bengal Sultanate at different time periods.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, Ava fought wars of unification but could never quite reassemble the lost empire. Having held off Ava, the Mon-speaking Hanthawaddy entered its golden age, and Arakan went on to become a power in its own right for the next 350 years. In contrast, constant warfare left Ava greatly weakened, and it slowly disintegrated from 1481 onward. In 1527, the Confederation of Shan States conquered Ava and ruled Upper Myanmar until 1555.

Like the Pagan Empire, Ava, Hanthawaddy and the Shan states were all multi-ethnic polities. Despite the wars, cultural synchronisation continued. This period is considered a golden age for Burmese culture. Burmese literature &quot;grew more confident, popular, and stylistically diverse&quot;, and the second generation of Burmese law codes as well as the earliest pan-Burma chronicles emerged. Hanthawaddy monarchs introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country.

=== Taungoo and Konbaung ===

Political unification returned in the mid-16th century, through the efforts of Taungoo, a former vassal state of Ava. Taungoo&#x27;s young, ambitious King Tabinshwehti defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War. His successor Bayinnaung went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland Southeast Asia including the Shan states, Lan Na, Manipur, Mong Mao, the Ayutthaya Kingdom, Lan Xang and southern Arakan. However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung&#x27;s death in 1581, completely collapsing by 1599. Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and Portuguese mercenaries established Portuguese rule at Thanlyin (Syriam).

The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features continued well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.
After the fall of Ava, the Konbaung–Hanthawaddy War involved one resistance group under Alaungpaya defeating the Restored Hanthawaddy, and by 1759 he had reunited all of Myanmar and Manipur and driven out the French and the British, who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy. By 1770, Alaungpaya&#x27;s heirs had subdued much of Laos and fought and won the Burmese–Siamese War against Ayutthaya and the Sino-Burmese War against Qing China.

With Burma preoccupied by the Chinese threat, Ayutthaya recovered its territories by 1770 and went on to capture Lan Na by 1776. Burma and Siam went to war until 1855, but all resulted in a stalemate, exchanging Tenasserim (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Ayutthaya). Faced with a powerful China and a resurgent Ayutthaya in the east, King Bodawpaya turned west, acquiring Arakan (1785), Manipur (1814) and Assam (1817). It was the second-largest empire in Burmese history but also one with a long ill-defined border with British India.

In 1826, Burma lost Arakan, Manipur, Assam and Tenasserim to the British in the First Anglo-Burmese War. In 1852, the British easily seized Lower Burma in the Second Anglo-Burmese War. King Mindon Min tried to modernise the kingdom and in 1875 narrowly avoided annexation by ceding the Karenni States. The British, alarmed by the consolidation of French Indochina, annexed the remainder of the country in the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885.

Konbaung kings extended Restored Toungoo&#x27;s administrative reforms and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion. For the first time in history, the Burmese language and culture came to predominate the entire Irrawaddy valley. The evolution and growth of Burmese literature and theatre continued, aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era (half of all males and 5% of females). Nonetheless, the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of British colonialism.

=== British Burma (1885–1948) ===


In the 19th century, Burmese rulers sought to maintain their traditional influence in the western areas of Assam, Manipur and Arakan. Pressing them, however, was the British East India Company, which was expanding its interests eastwards over the same territory. Over the next 60 years, diplomacy, raids, treaties and compromises, known collectively as the Anglo-Burmese Wars, continued until Britain proclaimed control over most of Burma. With the fall of Mandalay, all of Burma came under British rule, being annexed on 1 January 1886.

Throughout the colonial era, many Indians arrived as soldiers, civil servants, construction workers and traders and, along with the Anglo-Burmese community, dominated commercial and civil life in Burma. Rangoon became the capital of British Burma and an important port between Calcutta and Singapore. Burmese resentment was strong, and was vented in violent riots that periodically paralysed Rangoon until the 1930s. Some of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for Burmese culture and traditions. Buddhist monks became the vanguards of the independence movement. U Wisara, an activist monk, died in prison after a 166-day hunger strike.

On 1 April 1937, Burma became a separately administered colony of Britain, and Ba Maw became the first Prime Minister and Premier of Burma. Ba Maw was an outspoken advocate for Burmese self-rule, and he opposed the participation of Britain, and by extension Burma, in World War II. He resigned from the Legislative Assembly and was arrested for sedition. In 1940, before Japan formally entered the war, Aung San formed the Burma Independence Army in Japan.

As a major battleground, Burma was devastated during World War II by the Japanese invasion. Within months after they entered the war, Japanese troops had advanced on Rangoon, and the British administration had collapsed. A Burmese Executive Administration headed by Ba Maw was established by the Japanese in August 1942. Wingate&#x27;s British Chindits were formed into long-range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines. A similar American unit, Merrill&#x27;s Marauders, followed the Chindits into the Burmese jungle in 1943.

Beginning in late 1944, allied troops launched a series of offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in July 1945. The battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting. Overall, the Japanese lost some 150,000 men in Burma with 1,700 prisoners taken. Although many Burmese fought initially for the Japanese as part of the Burma Independence Army, many Burmese, mostly from the ethnic minorities, served in the British Burma Army. The Burma National Army and the Arakan National Army fought with the Japanese from 1942 to 1944 but switched allegiance to the Allied side in 1945. Overall, 170,000 to 250,000 Burmese civilians died during World War II.

Following World War II, Aung San negotiated the Panglong Agreement with ethnic leaders that guaranteed the independence of Myanmar as a unified state. Aung Zan Wai, Pe Khin, Bo Hmu Aung, Sir Maung Gyi, Sein Mya Maung, Myoma U Than Kywe were among the negotiators of the historic Panglong Conference negotiated with Bamar leader General Aung San and other ethnic leaders in 1947. In 1947, Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Myanmar, a transitional government. But in July 1947, political rivals assassinated Aung San and several cabinet members.

=== Independence (1948–1962) ===

On 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic, under the terms of the Burma Independence Act 1947. The new country was named the &quot;Union of Burma&quot;, with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first president and U Nu as its first prime minister. Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, Burma did not become a member of the Commonwealth. A bicameral parliament was formed, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Nationalities, and multi-party elections were held in 1951–1952, 1956 and 1960.

The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the Panglong Agreement, which combined Burma Proper, which consisted of Lower Burma and Upper Burma, and the Frontier Areas, which had been administered separately by the British.

In 1961, U Thant, the Union of Burma&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former secretary to the prime minister, was elected Secretary-General of the United Nations, a position he held for ten years.

When the non-Burman ethnic groups pushed for autonomy or federalism, alongside having a weak civilian government at the centre, the military leadership staged a coup d&#x27;état in 1962. Though incorporated in the 1947 Constitution, successive military governments construed the use of the term &#x27;federalism&#x27; as being anti-national, anti-unity and pro-disintegration.

=== Military rule (1962–2011) ===
On 2 March 1962, the military led by General Ne Win took control of Burma through a coup d&#x27;état, and the government had been under direct or indirect control by the military since then. Between 1962 and 1974, Myanmar was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general. Almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were nationalised or brought under government control under the Burmese Way to Socialism, which combined Soviet-style nationalisation and central planning.

A new constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma was adopted in 1974. Until 1988, the country was ruled as a one-party system, with the general and other military officers resigning and ruling through the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP). During this period, Myanmar became one of the world&#x27;s most impoverished countries. There were sporadic protests against military rule during the Ne Win years, and these were almost always violently suppressed. On 7 July 1962, the government broke up demonstrations at Rangoon University, killing 15 students. In 1974, the military violently suppressed anti-government protests at the funeral of U Thant. Student protests in 1975, 1976, and 1977 were quickly suppressed by overwhelming force.

In 1988, unrest over economic mismanagement and political oppression by the government led to widespread pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the country known as the 8888 Uprising. Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and General Saw Maung staged a coup d&#x27;état and formed the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). In 1989, SLORC declared martial law after widespread protests. The military government finalised plans for People&#x27;s Assembly elections on 31 May 1989. SLORC changed the country&#x27;s official English name from the &quot;Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma&quot; to the &quot;Union of Myanmar&quot; on 18 June 1989 by enacting the adaptation of the expression law.

In May 1990, the government held free multiparty elections for the first time in almost 30 years, and the National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, won earning 392 out of a total 492 seats (i.e., 80% of the seats). However, the military junta refused to cede power and continued to rule the nation, first as SLORC and, from 1997, as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) until its dissolution in March 2011. General Than Shwe took over the Chairmanship – effectively the position of Myanmar&#x27;s top ruler – from General Saw Maung in 1992 and held it until 2011.

On 23 June 1997, Myanmar was admitted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On 27 March 2006, the military junta, which had moved the national capital from Yangon to a site near Pyinmana in November 2005, officially named the new capital Naypyidaw, meaning &quot;city of the kings&quot;.


In August 2007, an increase in the price of fuel led to the Saffron Revolution led by Buddhist monks that were dealt with harshly by the government. The government cracked down on them on 26 September 2007, with reports of barricades at the Shwedagon Pagoda and monks killed. There were also rumours of disagreement within the Burmese armed forces, but none was confirmed. The military crackdown against unarmed protesters was widely condemned as part of the international reactions to the Saffron Revolution and led to an increase in economic sanctions against the Burmese Government.

In May 2008, Cyclone Nargis caused extensive damage in the densely populated rice-farming delta of the Irrawaddy Division. It was the worst natural disaster in Burmese history with reports of an estimated 200,000 people dead or missing, damages totalled to 10 billion US dollars, and as many as 1 million were left homeless. In the critical days following this disaster, Myanmar&#x27;s isolationist government was accused of hindering United Nations recovery efforts. Humanitarian aid was requested, but concerns about foreign military or intelligence presence in the country delayed the entry of United States military planes delivering medicine, food, and other supplies.

In early August 2009, a conflict broke out in Shan State in northern Myanmar. For several weeks, junta troops fought against ethnic minorities including the Han Chinese, Wa, and Kachin. During 8–12 August, the first days of the conflict, as many as 10,000 Burmese civilians fled to Yunnan in neighbouring China.

=== Civil wars ===

Civil wars have been a constant feature of Myanmar&#x27;s socio-political landscape since the attainment of independence in 1948. These wars are predominantly struggles for ethnic and sub-national autonomy, with the areas surrounding the ethnically Bamar central districts of the country serving as the primary geographical setting of conflict. Foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the areas in which Myanmar&#x27;s civil wars continue.

In October 2012, the ongoing conflicts in Myanmar included the Kachin conflict, between the Pro-Christian Kachin Independence Army and the government; a civil war between the Rohingya Muslims, and the government and non-government groups in Rakhine State; and a conflict between the Shan, Lahu, and Karen minority groups, and the government in the eastern half of the country. In addition, al-Qaeda signalled an intention to become involved in Myanmar.

Armed conflict between ethnic Chinese rebels and the Myanmar Armed Forces resulted in the Kokang offensive in February 2015. The conflict had forced 40,000 to 50,000 civilians to flee their homes and seek shelter on the Chinese side of the border. During the incident, the government of China was accused of giving military assistance to the ethnic Chinese rebels. Clashes between Burmese troops and local insurgent groups have continued, fuelling tensions between China and Myanmar.

=== Period of liberalisation, 2011–2021 ===

The military-backed Government had promulgated a &quot;Roadmap to Discipline-flourishing Democracy&quot; in 1993, but the process appeared to stall several times, until 2008 when the Government published a new draft national constitution, and organised a (flawed) national referendum which adopted it. The new constitution provided for election of a national assembly with powers to appoint a president, while practically ensuring army control at all levels.
A general election in 2010 - the first for twenty years - was boycotted by the NLD. The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party declared victory, stating that it had been favoured by 80 per cent of the votes; fraud, however, was alleged. A nominally civilian government was then formed, with retired general Thein Sein as president.

A series of liberalising political and economic actions – or reforms – then took place. By the end of 2011 these included the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission, the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners, new labour laws that permitted labour unions and strikes, a relaxation of press censorship, and the regulation of currency practices. In response, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Myanmar in December 2011 – the first visit by a US Secretary of State in more than fifty years – meeting both President Thein Sein and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s NLD party participated in the 2012 by-elections, facilitated by the government&#x27;s abolition of the laws that previously barred it. In the April 2012 by-elections, the NLD won 43 of the 45 available seats. The 2012 by-elections were also the first time that international representatives were allowed to monitor the voting process in Myanmar.

Myanmar&#x27;s improved international reputation was indicated by ASEAN&#x27;s approval of Myanmar&#x27;s bid for the position of ASEAN chair in 2014.

==== 2015 general elections ====
General elections were held on 8 November 2015. These were the first openly contested elections held in Myanmar since the 1990 general election (which was annulled). The results gave the NLD an absolute majority of seats in both chambers of the national parliament, enough to ensure that its candidate would become president, while NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the presidency.

The new parliament convened on 1 February 2016, and on 15 March 2016, Htin Kyaw was elected as the first non-military president since the military coup of 1962. On 6 April 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi assumed the newly created role of state counsellor, a role akin to a prime minister.

=== Coup d&#x27;état and civil war ===

In Myanmar&#x27;s 2020 parliamentary election, the ostensibly ruling National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, competed with various other smaller parties – particularly the military-affiliated Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). Suu Kyi&#x27;s NLD won the 2020 Myanmar general election on 8 November in a landslide. The USDP, regarded as a proxy for the military, suffered a &quot;humiliating&quot; defeat – even worse than in 2015 – capturing only 33 of the 476 elected seats.

As the election results began emerging, the USDP rejected them, urging a new election with the military as observers. More than 90 other smaller parties contested the vote, including more than 15 who complained of irregularities. However, election observers declared there were no major irregularities. However, despite the election commission validating the NLD&#x27;s overwhelming victory, the USDP and Myanmar&#x27;s military persistently alleged fraud.
In January, 2021, just before the new parliament was to be sworn in, the NLD announced that Suu Kyi would retain her State Counsellor role in the upcoming government.


In the early morning of 1 February 2021, the day parliament was set to convene, the Tatmadaw, Myanmar&#x27;s military, detained Suu Kyi and other members of the ruling party. The military handed power to military chief Min Aung Hlaing and declared a state of emergency for one year and began closing the borders, restricting travel and electronic communications nationwide. The military announced it would replace the existing election commission with a new one, and a military media outlet indicated new elections would be held in about one year – though the military avoided making an official commitment to that. The military expelled NLD party Members of Parliament from the capital city, Naypyidaw. By 15 March 2021 the military leadership continued to extend martial law into more parts of Yangon, while security forces killed 38 people in a single day of violence.

By the second day of the coup, thousands of protesters were marching in the streets of Yangon, and other protests erupted nationwide, largely halting commerce and transportation. Despite the military&#x27;s arrests and killings of protesters, the first weeks of the coup found growing public participation, including groups of civil servants, teachers, students, workers, monks and religious leaders – even normally disaffected ethnic minorities.

The coup was immediately condemned by the United Nations Secretary General, and leaders of democratic nations. The U.S. threatened sanctions on the military and its leaders, including a &quot;freeze&quot; of US$1 billion of their assets in the U.S. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Russia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines and China refrained from criticizing the military coup. A United Nations Security Council resolution called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the other detained leaders – a position shared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

International development and aid partners – business, non-governmental, and governmental – hinted at suspension of partnerships with Myanmar. Banks were closed and social media communications platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, removed Tatmadaw postings. Protesters appeared at Myanmar embassies in foreign countries. The National Unity Government then declared the formation of an armed wing on 5 May 2021, a date that is often cited as the start of a full-scale civil war. This armed wing was named the People&#x27;s Defence Force (PDF) to protect its supporters from military junta attacks and as a first step towards a Federal Union Army. The civil war is ongoing as of 2024.

== Geography ==
Myanmar has a total area of . It lies between latitudes 9° and 29°N, and longitudes 92° and 102°E. Myanmar is bordered in the northwest by the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh and the Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh states of India. Its north and northeast border is with the Tibet Autonomous Region and Yunnan for a Sino-Myanmar border total of . It is bounded by Laos and Thailand to the southeast. Myanmar has of contiguous coastline along the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea to the southwest and the south, which forms one quarter of its total perimeter.

In the north, the Hengduan Mountains form the border with China. Hkakabo Razi, located in Kachin State, at an elevation of , is the highest point in Myanmar. Many mountain ranges, such as the Rakhine Yoma, the Bago Yoma, the Shan Hills and the Tenasserim Hills exist within Myanmar, all of which run north-to-south from the Himalayas. The mountain chains divide Myanmar&#x27;s three river systems, which are the Irrawaddy, Salween (Thanlwin), and the Sittaung rivers. The Irrawaddy River, Myanmar&#x27;s longest river at nearly , flows into the Gulf of Martaban. Fertile plains exist in the valleys between the mountain chains. The majority of Myanmar&#x27;s population lives in the Irrawaddy valley, which is situated between the Rakhine Yoma and the Shan Plateau.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Myanmar is divided into seven states () and seven regions (), formerly called divisions. Regions are predominantly Bamar (that is, mainly inhabited by Myanmar&#x27;s dominant ethnic group). States, in essence, are regions that are home to particular ethnic minorities. The administrative divisions are further subdivided into districts, which are further subdivided into townships, wards, and villages.

Below are the number of districts, townships, cities/towns, wards, village groups and villages in each division and state of Myanmar as of 31 December 2001:

=== Climate ===


Much of the country lies between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator. It lies in the monsoon region of Asia, with its coastal regions receiving over of rain annually. Annual rainfall in the delta region is approximately , while average annual rainfall in the dry zone in central Myanmar is less than . The northern regions of Myanmar are the coolest, with average temperatures of . Coastal and delta regions have an average maximum temperature of .
Previously and currently analysed data, as well as future projections on changes caused by climate change predict serious consequences to development for all economic, productive, social, and environmental sectors in Myanmar. In order to combat the hardships ahead and do its part to help combat climate change Myanmar has displayed interest in expanding its use of renewable energy and lowering its level of carbon emissions. Groups involved in helping Myanmar with the transition and move forward include the UN Environment Programme, Myanmar Climate Change Alliance, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation which directed in producing the final draft of the Myanmar national climate change policy that was presented to various sectors of the Myanmar government for review.

In April 2015, it was announced that the World Bank and Myanmar would enter a full partnership framework aimed to better access to electricity and other basic services for about six million people and expected to benefit three million pregnant woman and children through improved health services. Acquired funding and proper planning has allowed Myanmar to better prepare for the impacts of climate change by enacting programs which teach its people new farming methods, rebuild its infrastructure with materials resilient to natural disasters, and transition various sectors towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

=== Biodiversity ===


Myanmar is a biodiverse country with more than 16,000 plant, 314 mammal, 1131 bird, 293 reptile, and 139 amphibian species, and 64 terrestrial ecosystems including tropical and subtropical vegetation, seasonally inundated wetlands, shoreline and tidal systems, and alpine ecosystems. Myanmar houses some of the largest intact natural ecosystems in Southeast Asia, but the remaining ecosystems are under threat from land use intensification and over-exploitation. According to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems categories and criteria more than a third of Myanmar&#x27;s land area has been converted to anthropogenic ecosystems over the last 2–3 centuries, and nearly half of its ecosystems are threatened. Despite large gaps in information for some ecosystems, there is a large potential to develop a comprehensive protected area network that protects its terrestrial biodiversity.

Myanmar continues to perform badly in the global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) with an overall ranking of 153 out of 180 countries in 2016, among the worst in the South Asian region. The environmental areas where Myanmar performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) are air quality (174), health impacts of environmental issues (143) and biodiversity and habitat (142). Myanmar performs best (i.e. lowest ranking) in environmental impacts of fisheries (21) but with declining fish stocks. Despite several issues, Myanmar also ranks 64 and scores very good (i.e. a high percentage of 93.73%) in environmental effects of the agricultural industry because of an excellent management of the nitrogen cycle. Myanmar is one of the most highly vulnerable countries to climate change; this poses a number of social, political, economic and foreign policy challenges to the country.

Myanmar&#x27;s slow economic growth has contributed to the preservation of much of its environment and ecosystems. Forests, including dense tropical growth and valuable teak in lower Myanmar, cover over 49% of the country, including areas of acacia, bamboo, ironwood and &quot;Magnolia champaca&quot;. Coconut and betel palm and rubber have been introduced. In the highlands of the north, oak, pine and various rhododendrons cover much of the land.

Heavy logging since the new 1995 forestry law went into effect has seriously reduced forest area and wildlife habitat. The lands along the coast support all varieties of tropical fruits and once had large areas of mangroves although much of the protective mangroves have disappeared. In much of central Myanmar (the dry zone), vegetation is sparse and stunted.

Typical jungle animals, particularly tigers, occur sparsely in Myanmar. In upper Myanmar, there are rhinoceros, wild water buffalo, clouded leopard, wild boars, deer, antelope, and elephants, which are also tamed or bred in captivity for use as work animals, particularly in the lumber industry. Smaller mammals are also numerous, ranging from gibbons and monkeys to flying foxes. The abundance of birds is notable with over 800 species, including parrots, myna, peafowl, red junglefowl, weaverbirds, crows, herons, and barn owl. Among reptile species there are crocodiles, geckos, cobras, Burmese pythons, and turtles. Hundreds of species of freshwater fish are wide-ranging, plentiful and are very important food sources.

== Government and politics ==
Myanmar operates &quot;de jure&quot; as a unitary assembly-independent republic under its 2008 constitution. But in February 2021, the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, was deposed by the Tatmadaw. In February 2021, Myanmar military declared a one-year state emergency and First Vice President Myint Swe became the Acting President of Myanmar and handed the power to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing and he assumed the role Chairman of the State Administration Council, then Prime Minister. The President of Myanmar acts as the de jure head of state and the Chairman of the State Administration Council acts as the de facto head of government.
The constitution of Myanmar, its third since independence, was drafted by its military rulers and published in September 2008. The country is governed as a parliamentary system with a bicameral legislature (with an executive president accountable to the legislature), with 25% of the legislators appointed by the military and the rest elected in general elections.

The legislature, called the Assembly of the Union, is bicameral and made up of two houses: The 224-seat upper House of Nationalities and the 440-seat lower House of Representatives. The upper house consists 168 members who are directly elected and 56 who are appointed by the Burmese Armed Forces. The lower house consists of 330 members who are directly elected and 110 who are appointed by the armed forces.

=== Political culture ===
The major political parties are the National League for Democracy and the Union Solidarity and Development Party.

Myanmar&#x27;s army-drafted constitution was approved in a referendum in May 2008. The results, 92.4% of the 22 million voters with an official turnout of 99%, are considered suspect by many international observers and by the National League of Democracy with reports of widespread fraud, ballot stuffing, and voter intimidation.

The elections of 2010 resulted in a victory for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party. Various foreign observers questioned the fairness of the elections. One criticism of the election was that only government-sanctioned political parties were allowed to contest in it and the popular National League for Democracy was declared illegal. However, immediately following the elections, the government ended the house arrest of the democracy advocate and leader of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, and her ability to move freely around the country is considered an important test of the military&#x27;s movement toward more openness.

=== Foreign relations ===

Though the country&#x27;s foreign relations, particularly with Western nations, have historically been strained, the situation has markedly improved since the reforms following the 2010 elections. After years of diplomatic isolation and economic and military sanctions, the United States relaxed curbs on foreign aid to Myanmar in November 2011 and announced the resumption of diplomatic relations on 13 January 2012 The European Union has placed sanctions on Myanmar, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid.

Sanctions imposed by the United States and European countries against the former military government, coupled with boycotts and other direct pressure on corporations by supporters of the democracy movement, have resulted in the withdrawal from the country of most U.S. and many European companies. Despite Western isolation, Asian corporations have generally remained willing to continue investing in the country and to initiate new investments, particularly in natural resource extraction. The country has close relations with neighbouring India and China with several Indian and Chinese companies operating in the country. Under India&#x27;s Look East policy, fields of co-operation between India and Myanmar include remote sensing, oil and gas exploration, information technology, hydropower and construction of ports and buildings. Myanmar also has close political relations with Vietnam and Japan.

In May 2013, Thein Sein became the first Myanmar president to visit the White House in 47 years. President Barack Obama praised the former general for political and economic reforms and the cessation of tensions between Myanmar and the United States. Political activists objected to the visit because of concerns over human rights abuses in Myanmar, but Obama assured Thein Sein that Myanmar will receive U.S. support. The two governments agreed to sign a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement on 21 May 2013.

In June 2013, Myanmar held its first ever summit, the World Economic Forum on East Asia 2013. A regional spinoff of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the summit was held on 5–7 June and attended by 1,200 participants, including 10 heads of state, 12 ministers and 40 senior directors from around the world.

On 19 January 2025, Reuters reported that ASEAN had told Myanmar&#x27;s military government to prioritise ceasefire, &quot;urging the junta to start dialogue and end hostilities immediately&quot; and &quot;to allow unhindered humanitarian access&quot;, citing Malaysia&#x27;s foreign minister Mohamad Hasan. The ASEAN chair&#x27;s statement denounced &quot;the continued acts of violence against civilians and public facilities and urged all parties involved&quot; to &quot;immediately halt indiscriminate violence, exercise utmost restraint, ensure the protection and safety of all civilians and civilian infrastructures, and create a conducive environment for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and inclusive national dialogue&quot;. 

=== Military ===
Since the late 1950s, Myanmar&#x27;s military has had major roles in Myanmar&#x27;s politics.
Myanmar has received extensive military aid from China in the past.
Myanmar has been a member of ASEAN since 1997. Though it gave up its turn to hold the ASEAN chair and host the ASEAN Summit in 2006, it chaired the forum and hosted the summit in 2014. In November 2008, Myanmar&#x27;s political situation with neighbouring Bangladesh became tense as they began searching for natural gas in a disputed block of the Bay of Bengal. Controversy surrounding the Rohingya population also remains an issue between Bangladesh and Myanmar.

Myanmar&#x27;s armed forces are known as the Tatmadaw, which numbers 488,000. The Tatmadaw comprises the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. The country ranked twelfth in the world for its number of active troops in service. The military is very influential in Myanmar, with all top cabinet and ministry posts usually held by military officials. Official figures for military spending are not available. Estimates vary widely because of uncertain exchange rates, but Myanmar&#x27;s military forces&#x27; expenses are high. Myanmar imports most of its weapons from Russia, Ukraine, China and India.

Myanmar is building a research nuclear reactor near Pyin Oo Lwin with help from Russia. It is one of the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation pact since 1992 and a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) since 1957. The military junta had informed the IAEA in September 2000 of its intention to construct the reactor. In 2010 as part of the leaked diplomatic cables, Myanmar was suspected of using North Korean construction teams to build a fortified surface-to-air missile facility. As of 2019, the United States Bureau of Arms Control assessed that Myanmar is not in violation of its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty but that the Myanmar government had a history of non-transparency on its nuclear programs and aims.

Until 2005, the United Nations General Assembly annually adopted a detailed resolution about the situation in Myanmar by consensus. But in 2006 a divided United Nations General Assembly voted through a resolution that strongly called upon the government of Myanmar to end its systematic violations of human rights. In January 2007, Russia and China vetoed a draft resolution before the United Nations Security Council calling on the government of Myanmar to respect human rights and begin a democratic transition. South Africa also voted against the resolution.

=== Human rights and internal conflicts ===


There is consensus that the former military regime in Myanmar (1962–2010) was one of the world&#x27;s most repressive and abusive regimes. In November 2012, Samantha Power, Barack Obama&#x27;s Special Assistant to the President on Human Rights, wrote on the White House blog that &quot;Serious human rights abuses against civilians in several regions continue, including against women and children.&quot; Members of the United Nations and major international human rights organisations have issued repeated and consistent reports of widespread and systematic human rights violations in Myanmar. The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly called on the Burmese military junta to respect human rights and in November 2009 the General Assembly adopted a resolution &quot;strongly condemning the ongoing systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms&quot; and calling on the Burmese military regime &quot;to take urgent measures to put an end to violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.&quot;

International human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have repeatedly documented and condemned widespread human rights violations in Myanmar. The &quot;Freedom in the World 2011&quot; report by Freedom House notes, &quot;The military junta has ... suppressed nearly all basic rights; and committed human rights abuses with impunity.&quot; In July 2013, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners indicated that there were approximately 100 political prisoners being held in Burmese prisons. Evidence gathered by a British researcher was published in 2005 regarding the extermination or &quot;Burmisation&quot; of certain ethnic minorities, such as the Karen, Karenni and Shan.
Based on the evidence gathered by Amnesty photographs and video of the ongoing armed conflict between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army (AA), attacks escalated on civilians in Rakhine State. Ming Yu Hah, Amnesty International&#x27;s Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns said, the UN Security Council must urgently refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court. The military is notorious for rampant use of sexual violence.

In November 2024, the ICC prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan KC filed an arrest warrant application of Senior General, Acting President and Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing for &quot;criminal responsibility for the crimes against humanity of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya, committed in Myanmar, and in part in Bangladesh&quot;.

==== Child soldiers ====
Child soldiers were reported in 2012 to have played a major part in the Burmese Army. &quot;The Independent&quot; reported in June 2012 that &quot;Children are being sold as conscripts into the Burmese military for as little as $40 and a bag of rice or a can of petrol.&quot; In September 2012, the Myanmar Armed Forces released 42 child soldiers, and the International Labour Organization met with representatives of the government as well as the Kachin Independence Army to secure the release of more child soldiers.

==== Slavery and human trafficking ====
Forced labour and human trafficking are common in Myanmar. Human trafficking happens mostly to women who are unemployed and have low incomes. They are deceived by brokers that better opportunities and wages exist for them abroad. In 2017, the government reported 185 trafficking cases. The government of Burma makes little effort to eliminate human trafficking. The U.S. State Department reported that both the government and Tatmadaw were complicit in sex and labour trafficking. Women and girls from all ethnic groups and foreigners have been victims of sex trafficking in Myanmar. They are forced into prostitution, marriages or pregnancies. Sex trafficking in Myanmar has been fuelled by factors like internal conflict, political instability, land confiscation, poor border management, and government restrictions on providing travel documents.

A cyber-scam industry in Myanmar&#x27;s borderlands has involved human trafficking, forced labour and other abuses. Many of the scam centres are in territories controlled by junta allies like the Border Guard Force. In August 2023, a report from the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights noted that at least 120,000 people in Myanmar were trapped in such centres by criminal gangs.

==== Genocide allegations and crimes against Rohingya people ====
The Rohingya people have consistently faced human rights abuses by the Burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as Burmese citizens (despite some of them having lived in Burma for over three generations)—the Rohingya have been denied Burmese citizenship since the enactment of a 1982 citizenship law. The Burmese regime has attempted to forcibly expel Rohingya and bring in non-Rohingyas to replace them—this policy has resulted in the expulsion of approximately half of the 800,000 Rohingya from Burma, while the Rohingya people have been described as &quot;among the world&#x27;s least wanted&quot; and &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most persecuted minorities.&quot;

Rohingya are not allowed to travel without official permission, are banned from owning land, and are required to sign a commitment to have no more than two children. As of July 2012, the Myanmar government does not include the Rohingya minority group—classified as stateless Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh since 1982—on the government&#x27;s list of more than 130 ethnic races and, therefore, the government states that they have no claim to Myanmar citizenship.

Since the democratic transition began in 2011, there has been continuous violence as 280 people have been killed and 140,000 forced to flee from their homes in the Rakhine state in 2014. A UN envoy reported in March 2013 that unrest had re-emerged between Myanmar&#x27;s Buddhist and Muslim communities, with violence spreading to towns that are located closer to Yangon.

==== Organ trading ====
The military forces took over Myanmar in 2021. A yearlong investigation conducted by CNN reveals that half of Myanmar&#x27;s 54 million population lives below poverty line. This drives many of them to the extreme measures such as online organ trade. This illegal action of selling their personal organs can earn them a payment equal to a two-year salary. Many advertise the organ they wish to donate on social media, this is an endless cycle as families time and again find themselves online to trade their organs as money runs out.  

==== Government reforms ====
According to the Crisis Group, since Myanmar transitioned to a new government in August 2011, the country&#x27;s human rights record has been improving. Previously giving Myanmar its lowest rating of 7, the 2012 &quot;Freedom in the World&quot; report also notes improvement, giving Myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil liberties and political rights, the release of political prisoners, and a loosening of restrictions. In 2013, Myanmar improved yet again, receiving a score of 5 in civil liberties and 6 in political freedoms.

The government has assembled a National Human Rights Commission that consists of 15 members from various backgrounds. Several activists in exile, including Thee Lay Thee Anyeint members, have returned to Myanmar after President Thein Sein&#x27;s invitation to expatriates to return home to work for national development. In an address to the United Nations Security Council on 22 September 2011, Myanmar&#x27;s Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin confirmed the government&#x27;s intention to release prisoners in the near future.

The government has also relaxed reporting laws, but these remain highly restrictive. In September 2011, several banned websites, including YouTube, Democratic Voice of Burma and Voice of America, were unblocked. A 2011 report by the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations found that, while contact with the Myanmar government was constrained by donor restrictions, international humanitarian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) see opportunities for effective advocacy with government officials, especially at the local level. At the same time, international NGOs are mindful of the ethical quandary of how to work with the government without bolstering or appeasing it. 
Following Thein Sein&#x27;s first ever visit to the UK and a meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron, the Myanmar president declared that all of his nation&#x27;s political prisoners will be released by the end of 2013, in addition to a statement of support for the well-being of the Rohingya Muslim community. In a speech at Chatham House, he revealed that &quot;We [Myanmar government] are reviewing all cases. I guarantee to you that by the end of this year, there will be no prisoners of conscience in Myanmar.&quot;

Homosexual acts are illegal in Myanmar and can be punishable by life imprisonment.

In 2016, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi was accused of failing to protect Myanmar&#x27;s Muslim minority. Since August 2017 Doctors Without Borders have treated 113 Rohingya refugee females for sexual assault with all but one describing military assailants.

== Economy ==
Myanmar&#x27;s economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the world with a nominal GDP of US$76.09 billion in 2019 and an estimated purchasing power adjusted GDP of US$327.629 billion in 2017 according to the World Bank. Foreigners are able to legally lease but not own property. In December 2014, Myanmar set up its first stock exchange, the Yangon Stock Exchange.

The informal economy&#x27;s share in Myanmar is one of the biggest in the world and is closely linked to corruption, smuggling and illegal trade activities. In addition, decades of civil war and unrest have contributed to Myanmar&#x27;s current levels of poverty and lack of economic progress. Myanmar lacks adequate infrastructure. Goods travel primarily across the Thai border (where most illegal drugs are exported) and along the Irrawaddy River. Notably, opium production in Myanmar is the world&#x27;s second-largest source of opium after Afghanistan, producing some 25% of the world&#x27;s opium, forming part of the Golden Triangle. While opium poppy cultivation in Myanmar had declined year-on-year since 2015, cultivation area increased by 33% totalling 40,100 hectares alongside an 88% increase in yield potential to 790 tonnes in 2022 according to latest data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Myanmar Opium Survey 2022. With that said, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has also warned that opium production in Myanmar may rise again if the economic crunch brought on by COVID-19 and the country&#x27;s February 1 military coup persists, with significant public health and security consequences for much of Asia. At the same time, the Golden Triangle, and specifically Shan State of Myanmar, is believed to be the largest methamphetamine producing area in the world. The growing signs of an intensification of methamphetamine manufacturing activity within and around the Golden Triangle, and a corresponding decrease in the number of production facilities dismantled in other parts of the region, suggests that methamphetamine manufacture in East and Southeast Asia is now consolidated into the lower Mekong region. Countries in East and Southeast Asia have collectively witnessed sustained increases in seizures of methamphetamine over the last decade, totalling over 171 tons and a record of over 1 billion methamphetamine tablets in 2021 according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, more than any other part of the world. In April and May 2020, Myanmar authorities reported Asia&#x27;s largest ever drug operation in Shan State totalling what was believed to be 193 million methamphetamine tablets, hundreds of kilogrammes of crystal methamphetamine as well as some heroin, and over 162,000 litres and 35.5 tons of drug precursors as well as sophisticated production equipment and several staging and storage facilities.

Both China and India have attempted to strengthen ties with the government for economic benefit in the early 2010s. Many Western nations, including the United States and Canada, and the European Union, historically imposed investment and trade sanctions on Myanmar. The United States and European Union eased most of their sanctions in 2012. From May 2012 to February 2013, the United States began to lift its economic sanctions on Myanmar &quot;in response to the historic reforms that have been taking place in that country.&quot; Foreign investment comes primarily from China, Singapore, the Philippines, South Korea, India, and Thailand. The military has stakes in some major industrial corporations of the country (from oil production and consumer goods to transportation and tourism).

=== Economic history ===
Under the British administration, the people of Burma were at the bottom of the social hierarchy, with Europeans at the top, Indians, Chinese, and Christianized minorities in the middle, and Buddhist Burmese at the bottom. Forcefully integrated into the world economy, Burma&#x27;s economy grew by involving itself with extractive industries and cash crop agriculture. However, much of the wealth was concentrated in the hands of Europeans. The country became the world&#x27;s largest exporter of rice, mainly to European markets, while other colonies like India suffered mass starvation. Being a follower of free market principles, the British opened up the country to large-scale immigration with Rangoon exceeding New York City as the greatest immigration port in the world in the 1920s. Historian Thant Myint-U states, &quot;This was out of a total population of only 13 million; it was equivalent to the United Kingdom today taking 2 million people a year.&quot; By then, in most of Burma&#x27;s largest cities, Rangoon, Akyab, Bassein and Moulmein, the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population. The Burmese under British rule felt helpless, and reacted with a &quot;racism that combined feelings of superiority and fear&quot;.

Crude oil production, an indigenous industry of Yenangyaung, was taken over by the British and put under Burmah Oil monopoly. British Burma began exporting crude oil in 1853. European firms produced 75% of the world&#x27;s teak. The wealth was, however, mainly concentrated in the hands of Europeans. In the 1930s, agricultural production fell dramatically as international rice prices declined and did not recover for several decades. During the Japanese invasion of Burma in World War II, the British followed a scorched earth policy. They destroyed major government buildings, oil wells and mines that developed for tungsten (Mawchi), tin, lead and silver to keep them from the Japanese. Myanmar was bombed extensively by the Allies.

After independence, the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed. With the loss of India, Burma lost relevance and obtained independence from the British. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister U Nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all of the land in Burma. The government tried to implement an eight-year plan partly financed by injecting money into the economy, but this caused inflation to rise. The 1962 coup d&#x27;état was followed by an economic scheme called the Burmese Way to Socialism, a plan to nationalise all industries, with the exception of agriculture. While the economy continued to grow at a slower rate, the country eschewed a Western-oriented development model, and by the 1980s, was left behind capitalist powerhouses like Singapore which were integrated with Western economies. Myanmar asked for admittance to a least developed country status in 1987 to receive debt relief.

=== Agriculture ===

The major agricultural product is rice, which covers about 60% of the country&#x27;s total cultivated land area. Rice accounts for 97% of total food grain production by weight. Through collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute, 52 modern rice varieties were released in the country between 1966 and 1997, helping increase national rice production to 14 million tons in 1987 and to 19 million tons in 1996. By 1988, modern varieties were planted on half of the country&#x27;s ricelands, including 98 percent of the irrigated areas. In 2008 rice production was estimated at 50 million tons.

=== Extractive industries ===
Myanmar produces precious stones such as rubies, sapphires, pearls, and jade. Rubies are the biggest earner; 90% of the world&#x27;s rubies come from the country, whose red stones are prized for their purity and hue. Thailand buys the majority of the country&#x27;s gems. Myanmar&#x27;s &quot;Valley of Rubies&quot;, the mountainous Mogok area, north of Mandalay, is noted for its rare pigeon&#x27;s blood rubies and blue sapphires.

Many U.S. and European jewellery companies, including Bulgari, Tiffany and Cartier, refuse to import these stones based on reports of deplorable working conditions in the mines. Human Rights Watch has encouraged a complete ban on the purchase of Burmese gems based on these reports and because nearly all profits go to the ruling junta, as the majority of mining activity in the country is government-run. The government of Myanmar controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private owners of mines.

Rare-earth elements are also a significant export, as Myanmar supplies around 10% of the world&#x27;s rare earths. Conflict in Kachin State has threatened the operations of its mines as of February 2021.

Other industries include agricultural goods, textiles, wood products, construction materials, gems, metals, oil and natural gas. Myanmar Engineering Society has identified at least 39 locations capable of geothermal power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to Yangon which is a significant underutilised resource for electrical production.

=== Tourism ===

The government receives a significant percentage of the income of private-sector tourism services. The most popular available tourist destinations in Myanmar include big cities such as Yangon and Mandalay; religious sites in Mon State, Pindaya, Bago and Hpa-An; nature trails in Inle Lake, Kengtung, Putao, Pyin Oo Lwin; ancient cities such as Bagan and Mrauk-U; as well as beaches in Nabule, Ngapali, Ngwe-Saung, and Mergui. Nevertheless, much of the country is off-limits to tourists, and interactions between foreigners and the people of Myanmar, particularly in the border regions, are subject to police scrutiny. They are not to discuss politics with foreigners, under penalty of imprisonment and, in 2001, the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit &quot;unnecessary contact&quot; between foreigners and ordinary Burmese people.

The most common way for travellers to enter the country is by air. According to the website &quot;Lonely Planet&quot;, getting into Myanmar is problematic: &quot;No bus or train service connects Myanmar with another country, nor can you travel by car or motorcycle across the border – you must walk across.&quot; They further state that &quot;It is not possible for foreigners to go to/from Myanmar by sea or river.&quot; There are a few border crossings that allow the passage of private vehicles, such as the border between Ruili (China) to Mu-se, the border between Htee Kee (Myanmar) and Phu Nam Ron (Thailand)—the most direct border between Dawei and Kanchanaburi, and the border between Myawaddy and Mae Sot, Thailand. At least one tourist company has successfully run commercial overland routes through these borders since 2013.

Flights are available from most countries, though direct flights are limited to mainly Thai and other ASEAN airlines. According to &quot;Eleven&quot; magazine, &quot;In the past, there were only 15 international airlines and increasing numbers of airlines have begun launching direct flights from Japan, Qatar, Taiwan, South Korea, Germany and Singapore.&quot;

== Demographics ==

The provisional results of the 2014 Myanmar Census showed that the total population was 51,419,420. This figure includes an estimated 1,206,353 persons in parts of northern Rakhine State, Kachin State and Kayin State who were not counted. People who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures. There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand, and millions more work illegally. Burmese citizens account for 80% of all migrant workers in Thailand. At the beginning of the 20th century, Burma&#x27;s population was approximately 10 million. The national population density is , among the lowest in Southeast Asia.

Myanmar&#x27;s fertility rate in 2011 was 2.23, slightly above the replacement level and low compared to Southeast Asian countries of similar economic standing. There has been a significant decline in fertility in the 2000s, from a rate of 4.7 children per woman in 1983, down to 2.4 in 2001, despite the absence of any national population policy. The fertility rate is much lower in urban areas.

The relatively rapid decline in fertility is attributed to several factors, including extreme delays in marriage (almost unparalleled among developing countries in the region), the prevalence of illegal abortions, and the high proportion of single, unmarried women of reproductive age, with 25.9% of women aged 30–34 and 33.1% of men and women aged 25–34 being single.

These patterns stem from economic dynamics, including high income inequality, which results in residents of reproductive age opting for delay of marriage and family-building in favour of attempting to find employment and establish some form of wealth; the average age of marriage in Myanmar is 27.5 for men, 26.4 for women.

=== Ethnic groups ===

Myanmar is ethnically diverse. The government recognises 135 distinct ethnic groups. There are at least 108 different ethnolinguistic groups in Myanmar, consisting mainly of distinct Tibeto-Burman peoples, but with sizeable populations of Tai–Kadai, Hmong–Mien, and Austroasiatic (Mon–Khmer) peoples.

The Bamar form an estimated 68% of the population. 10% of the population are Shan. The Kayin make up 7% of the population. The Rakhine people constitute 4% of the population. Overseas Chinese form approximately 3% of the population. Myanmar&#x27;s ethnic minority groups prefer the term &quot;ethnic nationality&quot; over &quot;ethnic minority&quot; as the term &quot;minority&quot; furthers their sense of insecurity in the face of what is often described as &quot;Burmanisation&quot;—the proliferation and domination of the dominant Bamar culture over minority cultures.

Mon, who form 2% of the population, are ethno-linguistically related to the Khmer. Overseas Indians are 2%. The remainder are Kachin, Chin, Rohingya, Anglo-Indians, Gurkha, Nepali and other ethnic minorities. Included in this group are the Anglo-Burmese. Once forming a large and influential community, the Anglo-Burmese left the country in steady streams from 1958 onwards, principally to Australia and the United Kingdom. It is estimated that 52,000 Anglo-Burmese remain in Myanmar. , 110,000 Burmese refugees were living in refugee camps in Thailand.

Refugee camps exist along Indian, Bangladeshi and Thai borders while several thousand are in Malaysia. Conservative estimates state that there are over 295,800 minority refugees from Myanmar, with the majority being Rohingya, Karen, and Karenni are principally located along the Thai-Myanmar border. There are nine permanent refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of which were established in the mid-1980s. The refugee camps are under the care of the Thai-Burma Border Consortium (TBBC). Since 2006, over 55,000 Burmese refugees have been resettled in the United States.

The persecution of Burmese Indians, Burmese Chinese and other ethnic groups after the military coup headed by General Ne Win in 1962 led to the expulsion or emigration of 300,000 people. They migrated to escape racial discrimination and the wholesale nationalisation of private enterprise that took place in 1964. The Anglo-Burmese at this time either fled the country or changed their names and blended in with the broader Burmese society.

Many Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar. Many refugees headed to neighbouring Bangladesh, including 200,000 in 1978 as a result of the King Dragon operation in Arakan. 250,000 more left in 1991. Since August 2017, an estimated 23,000-43,700 Rohingya have been killed in the ongoing Rohingya genocide, and another 730,000 have fled to Bangladesh.

=== Languages ===
Myanmar is home to four major language families: Sino-Tibetan, Tai–Kadai, Austroasiatic, and Indo-European. Sino-Tibetan languages are most widely spoken. They include Burmese, Karen, Kachin, Chin, and Chinese (mainly Hokkien). The primary Tai–Kadai language is Shan. Mon, Palaung, and Wa are the major Austroasiatic languages spoken in Myanmar. The two major Indo-European languages are Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, and English. More than a hundred languages are spoken in total. Since many of them are known only within small tribes around the country, they may have been lost (many if not all) after a few generations.

Burmese, the mother tongue of the Bamar and official language of Myanmar, is related to Tibetan and Chinese. It is written in a script consisting of circular and semi-circular letters, which were adapted from the Mon script, which in turn was developed from a southern Indian script in the 5th century. The earliest known inscriptions in the Burmese script date from the 11th century. It is also used to write Pali, the sacred language of Theravada Buddhism, as well as several ethnic minority languages, including Shan, several Karen dialects, and Kayah (Karenni), with the addition of specialised characters and diacritics for each language.

=== Religion ===
Many religions are practised in Myanmar. Religious edifices and orders have been in existence for many years. The Christian and Muslim populations do, however, face religious persecution and it is hard, if not impossible, for non-Buddhists to join the army or get government jobs, the main route to success in the country. Such persecution and targeting of civilians is particularly notable in eastern Myanmar, where over 3,000 villages have been destroyed in the past ten years. More than 200,000 Muslims have fled to Bangladesh by 2007 to escape persecution.

A large majority of the population practices Buddhism; estimates range from 80% to 89%. According to 2014 Myanmar Census, 87.9% of the population identifies as Buddhists. Theravāda Buddhism is the most widespread. There are some 500,000 Buddhist monks and 75,000 nuns in this country of 54 million. Other religions are practised largely without obstruction, with the notable exception of some religious minorities such as the Rohingya people, who have continued to have their citizenship status denied and treated as illegal immigrants instead, and Christians in Chin State.

According to 2014 census, 6.2% of the population identifies as Christian; 4.3% as Muslim; 0.8% as followers of tribal religions; 0.5% as Hindus; 0.2% as followers of other religions; and 0.1% follow no religion. According to the 2010 estimates of the Pew Research Center, 7% of the population is Christian; 4% is Muslim; 1% follows traditional animistic beliefs; and 2% follow other religions, including Mahayana Buddhism, Hinduism, and East Asian religions. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have been present since 1914 and have about 80 congregations around the country and a branch office in Yangon publishing in 16 languages. A tiny Jewish community in Yangon had a synagogue but no resident rabbi.
Although Hinduism is practised by 0.5% of the population, it was a major religion in Myanmar&#x27;s past. Burmese folk religion is practised by many Bamars alongside Buddhism.

=== Health ===

The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country&#x27;s GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Myanmar is 240. This is compared with 219.3 in 2008 and 662 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 73 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5&#x27;s mortality is 47. According to Doctors without Borders, 25,000 Burmese AIDS patients died in 2007, deaths that could largely have been prevented by antiretroviral therapy drugs and proper treatment.

HIV/AIDS, recognised as a disease of concern by the Myanmar Ministry of Health, is most prevalent among sex workers and intravenous drug users. In 2005, the estimated adult HIV prevalence rate in Myanmar was 1.3% (200,000–570,000 people), according to UNAIDS, and early indicators of any progress against the HIV epidemic are inconsistent. However, the National AIDS Programme Myanmar found that 32% of sex workers and 43% of intravenous drug users in Myanmar have HIV.

=== Education ===


According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, Myanmar&#x27;s official literacy rate as of 2000 was 90%. Historically, Myanmar has had high literacy rates. The educational system of Myanmar is operated by the government agency, the Ministry of Education. The education system is based on the United Kingdom&#x27;s system after nearly a century of British and Christian presences in Myanmar. Nearly all schools are government-operated, but there has been an increase in privately funded English language schools in the early 21st century. Schooling is compulsory until the end of elementary school, approximately 9 years old, while the compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level.

There are 101 universities, 12 institutes, 9 degree colleges and 24 colleges in Myanmar, a total of 146 higher education institutions. There are 10 technical training schools, 23 nursing training schools, 1 sport academy and 20 midwifery schools. There are four international schools acknowledged by WASC and College Board—The International School Yangon, Myanmar International School, Yangon International School, and International School of Myanmar in Yangon. Myanmar was ranked 125th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

=== Crime ===
Myanmar had a murder rate of 15.2 per 100,000 population with a total of 8,044 murders in 2012. Factors influencing Myanmar&#x27;s high murder rate include communal violence and armed conflict. Myanmar is one of the world&#x27;s most corrupt nations. The 2012 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index ranked the country at number 171, out of 176 countries in total. Myanmar is the world&#x27;s second largest producer of opium after Afghanistan, producing some 25% of the world&#x27;s opium, and forms part of the Golden Triangle. The opium industry was a monopoly during colonial times and has since been illegally operated by corrupt officials in the Burmese military and rebel fighters, primarily as the basis for heroin manufacture. Myanmar is the largest producer of methamphetamines in the world, with the majority of &quot;Ya ba&quot; found in Thailand produced in Myanmar, particularly in the Golden Triangle and northeastern Shan State, which borders Thailand, Laos and China. Burmese-produced &quot;ya ba&quot; is typically trafficked to Thailand via Laos, before being transported through the northeastern Thai region of Isan.

== Culture ==
A diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar, with majority culture primarily Buddhist and Bamar. Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries, manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre. The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism. Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the &quot;Yama Zatdaw&quot;, an adaptation of India&#x27;s &quot;Ramayana&quot;, has been influenced greatly by Thai, Mon, and Indian versions of the play. Buddhism is practised along with nat worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats.

In a traditional village, the monastery is the centre of cultural life. Monks are venerated and supported by the lay people. A novitiation ceremony called shinbyu is the most important coming of age events for a boy, during which he enters the monastery for a short time. All male children in Buddhist families are encouraged to be a novice (beginner for Buddhism) before the age of twenty and to be a monk after the age of twenty. Girls have ear-piercing ceremonies () at the same time. Burmese culture is most evident in villages where local festivals are held throughout the year, the most important being the pagoda festival. Many villages have a guardian nat, and superstition and taboos are commonplace.

British colonial rule introduced Western elements of culture to Myanmar. Myanmar&#x27;s education system is modelled after that of the United Kingdom. Colonial architectural influences are most evident in major cities such as Yangon. Many ethnic minorities, particularly the Karen in the southeast and the Kachin and Chin who populate the north and northeast, practice Christianity. According to &quot;The World Factbook&quot;, the Burman population is 68% and the ethnic groups constitute 32%. In contrast, the exiled leaders and organisations claim the country is 40% ethnic.

=== Cuisine ===

Burmese cuisine is characterised by extensive use of fish products such as fish sauce, ngapi (fermented seafood) and dried prawn. Mohinga is the traditional breakfast dish and is Myanmar&#x27;s national dish. Seafood is a common ingredient in coastal cities, while meat and poultry are more commonly used in landlocked cities like Mandalay. Freshwater fish and shrimp have been incorporated into inland cooking as a primary source of protein and are used in a variety of ways, fresh, salted whole or filleted, salted and dried, made into a salty paste, or fermented sour and pressed. Burmese cuisine also includes a variety of salads (&quot;a thoke&quot;), centred on one major ingredient, ranging from starches like rice, wheat and rice noodles, glass noodles and vermicelli, to potato, ginger, tomato, kaffir lime, long bean, and lahpet (pickled tea leaves).

=== Sport ===

The Lethwei, Bando, Banshay, and Pongyi thaing martial arts and chinlone are traditional sports in Myanmar. Football is played all over the country, even in villages, and its national team is ruled by the Myanmar Football Federation. The 2013 Southeast Asian Games took place in Naypyidaw, Yangon, Mandalay and Ngwesaung Beach in December representing the third occasion that the event has been staged in Myanmar. Myanmar previously hosted the games in 1961 and 1969.

=== Art ===

Burmese traditional art concepts are popular and respected by the Burmese people and people from abroad. Burmese contemporary art has developed quite rapidly on its own terms. Artists born after the 1980s have had greater chances of art practice outside the country.

One of the first to study western art was Ba Nyan. Together with Ngwe Gaing and a handful of other artists, they were the pioneers of western painting style. Later on most young children learned the concepts from them. Some well known contemporary artists are Lun Gywe, Aung Kyaw Htet, MPP Yei Myint, Myint Swe, Min Wai Aung, Aung Myint, Kin Maung Yin, Po Po and Zaw Zaw Aung.

=== Media and communications ===

Because of Myanmar&#x27;s political climate, there are not many media companies in relation to the country&#x27;s population. Some are privately owned. All programming must meet with the approval of the censorship board. The Burmese government announced on 20 August 2012 that it would stop censoring media before publication. Following the announcement, newspapers and other outlets no longer required approved by state censors; however, journalists in the country can still face consequences for what they write and say. In April 2013, international media reports were published to relay the enactment of the media liberalisation reforms that we announced in August 2012. For the first time in numerous decades, the publication of privately owned newspapers commenced in the country.

==== Internet ====
Internet use is estimated to be relatively low compared to other countries. Myanmar&#x27;s internet used to be subject to censorship, and authorities viewed e-mails and posts on Internet blogs until 2012 when the government removed media censorship. During the strict censorship days, activity at internet cafes was regulated, and one blogger named Zarganar was sentenced to prison for publishing a video of destruction caused by Cyclone Nargis in 2008; Zarganar was released in October 2011.

In regards to communications infrastructure, Myanmar is the last ranked Asian country in the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Networked Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the development level of a country&#x27;s information and communication technologies. With 139 countries reported on, Myanmar ranked number 133 overall in the 2016 NRI ranking.

=== Film ===

Myanmar&#x27;s first film was a documentary of the funeral of Tun Shein—a leading politician of the 1910s, who campaigned for Burmese independence in London. The first Burmese silent film &quot;Myitta Ne Thuya&quot; (&quot;Love and Liquor&quot;) in 1920 which proved a major success, despite its poor quality. During the 1920s and 1930s, many Burmese-owned film companies made and produced several films. The first Burmese sound film was produced in 1932 in Bombay, India with the title Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya (Money Can&#x27;t Buy It). After World War II, Burmese cinema continued to address political themes. Many of the films produced in the early Cold War era had a strong propaganda element.

In the era that followed the political events of 1988, the film industry has been increasingly controlled by the government. Film stars who had been involved in the political activities were banned from appearing in films. The government issues strict rules on censorship and largely determines who produces films, as well as who gets academy awards.

Over the years, the movie industry has also shifted to producing many lower-budget direct-to-video films. Most of the movies produced nowadays are comedies. In 2008, only 12 films worthy of being considered for an Academy Award were made, although at least 800 VCDs were produced. Myanmar is the primary subject of a 2007 graphic novel titled &quot;Chroniques Birmanes&quot; by Québécois author and animator, Guy Delisle. The graphic novel was translated into English under the title &quot;Burma Chronicles&quot; in 2008. In 2009, a documentary about Burmese videojournalists called &quot;Burma VJ&quot; was released. This film was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 2010 Academy Awards. &quot;The Lady&quot; had its world premiere on 12 September 2011 at the 36th Toronto International Film Festival.

<text>&quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot;, also known as the &quot;Mazurek Dąbrowskiego&quot; (English: Dąbrowski&#x27;s Mazurka), and the &quot;Song of the Polish Legions in Italy&quot;, is the national anthem of Poland. 
The original lyrics were written by Józef Wybicki in Reggio Emilia, in Northern Italy, between 16 and 19 July 1797, two years after the Third Partition of Poland marked the end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Its initial purpose was to raise the morale of Jan Henryk Dąbrowski&#x27;s Polish Legions that served with Napoleon Bonaparte in the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. The song expressed the idea that the nation of Poland, despite lacking an independent state of their own, had not disappeared as long as the Polish people endured and fought in its name.

Following the declaration of independence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918, the song became its &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem, and was officially adopted in 1927. It also inspired similar songs by other peoples struggling for independence during the 19th century, such as the Ukrainian anthem &quot;Ukraine Is Not Yet Perished&quot; and the Yugoslav anthem &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot;. The first Slovak Republic also used the Polish anthem&#x27;s melody for its anthem.

==Etymology==
It is also known by its original title, &quot; (&#x27;Song of the Polish Legions in Italy&#x27;). As there are no official translations of the name into English, various translations of its Polish incipit &quot;&quot; include &#x27;Poland has not yet perished&#x27;, &#x27;Poland has not perished yet&#x27;, &#x27;Poland is not lost&#x27;, &#x27;Poland is not lost yet&#x27;, &#x27;Poland is not yet lost&#x27;, and &#x27;Poland has not yet succumbed&#x27;.

== Lyrics ==
The original lyrics, authored by Wybicki, are a poem consisting of six quatrains and a refrain quatrain repeated after all but the last stanza, all following an ABAB rhyme scheme. The official lyrics, based on a variant from 1806, &quot;Poland has not yet died&quot; suggesting a more violent cause of the nation&#x27;s possible death. Wybicki&#x27;s original manuscript was in the hands of his descendants until February 1944, when it was lost in Wybicki&#x27;s great-great-grandson, Johann von Roznowski&#x27;s home in Charlottenburg during the Allied bombing of Berlin. The manuscript is known today only from facsimile copies, twenty four of which were made in 1886 by Edward Rożnowski, Wybicki&#x27;s grandson, who donated them to Polish libraries.

The main theme of the poem is the idea that was novel in the times of early nationalisms based on centralized nation-statesthat the lack of political sovereignty does not preclude the existence of a nation. As Adam Mickiewicz explained in 1842 to students of Slavic Literature in Paris, the song &quot;The famous song of the Polish legions begins with lines that express the new history: Poland has not perished yet as long as we live. These words mean that people who have in them what constitutes the essence of a nation can prolong the existence of their country regardless of its political circumstances and may even strive to make it real again...&quot; The song also includes a call to arms and expresses the hope that, under General Dąbrowski&#x27;s command, the legionaries would rejoin their nation and retrieve &quot;what the alien force has seized&quot; through armed struggle.

The chorus and subsequent stanzas include heart-lifting examples of military heroes, set as role models for Polish soldiers: Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, Napoleon, Stefan Czarniecki and Tadeusz Kościuszko.

Dąbrowski, for whom the anthem is named, was a commander in the failed 1794 Kościuszko Uprising against Russia. After the Third Partition in 1795, he came to Paris to seek French aid in re-establishing Polish independence and, in 1796, he started the formation of the Polish Legions, a Polish unit of the French Revolutionary Army.

Bonaparte was, at the time when the song was written, a commander of the Italian campaign of French Revolutionary Wars and Dąbrowski&#x27;s superior. Having already proven his skills as a military leader, he is described in the lyrics as the one &quot;who has shown us ways to victory.&quot; Bonaparte is the only non-Polish person mentioned by name in the Polish anthem.

Stefan Czarniecki was a 17th-century hetman, famous for his role in driving the Swedish Army out of Poland after an occupation that had left the country in ruins and is remembered by Poles as the Deluge. With the outbreak of a Dano-Swedish War, he continued his fight against Sweden in Denmark, from where he &quot;returned across the sea&quot; to fight the invaders alongside the king who was then at the Royal Castle in Poznań. In the same castle, Józef Wybicki, started his career as a lawyer in 1765.

Kościuszko, mentioned in a stanza now missing from the anthem, became a hero of the American Revolutionary War before coming back to Poland to defend his native country from Russia in the war of 1792 and a national uprising he led in 1794. One of his major victories during the uprising was the Battle of Racławice where the result was partly due to Polish peasants armed with scythes. Alongside the scythes, the song mentioned other types of weaponry, traditionally used by the Polish &quot;szlachta&quot;, or nobility: the sabre, known in Polish as &quot;szabla&quot;, and the backsword.

Basia (a feminine diminutive of Barbara) and her father are fictional characters. They are used to represent the women and elderly men who waited for the Polish soldiers to return home and liberate their fatherland. The route that Dąbrowski and his legions hoped to follow upon leaving Italy is hinted at by the words &quot;we&#x27;ll cross the Vistula, we&#x27;ll cross the Warta&quot;, two major rivers flowing through the parts of Poland that were in Austrian and Prussian hands at the time.

===Current official lyrics===


===Original text by Józef Wybicki===

== Music ==

The melody of the Polish anthem is a lively and rhythmical mazurka. Mazurka as a musical form derives from the stylization of traditional melodies for the folk dances of Mazovia, a region in central Poland. It is characterized by a triple meter and strong accents placed irregularly on the second or third beat. Considered one of Poland&#x27;s national dances in pre-partition times, it owes its popularity in 19th-century Western European ballrooms to the mazurkas of Frédéric Chopin.

The composer of &quot; is not known. The melody is most probably Wybicki&#x27;s adaptation of a folk tune that had already been popular during the second half of the 18th century. The composition used to be erroneously attributed to Michał Kleofas Ogiński who was known to have written a march for Dąbrowski&#x27;s legions. Several historians confused Ogiński&#x27;s &quot; (&#x27;March for the Polish Legions&#x27;) with Wybicki&#x27;s mazurka, possibly due to the mazurka&#x27;s chorus &quot;March, march, Dąbrowski&quot;, until Ogiński&#x27;s sheet music for the march was discovered in 1938 and proven to be a different piece of music than Poland&#x27;s national anthem.

The first composer to use the anthem for an artistical music piece is always stated to be Karol Kurpiński. In 1821 he composed his piano/organ Fugue on &quot;Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła&quot; (it was published in 1821 in Warsaw; the first modern edition by Rostislaw Wygranienko was printed only in 2009). However, Karol Lipiński used it in an overture for his opera &quot;Kłótnia przez zakład&quot; composed and staged in Lviv .

 was the next who arranged &quot;&quot; for the piano. The arrangement, accompanied by the lyrics in Polish and French, was published 1829 in Paris. German composers who were moved by the suffering of the November Uprising wove the mazurek into their works. Examples include Richard Wagner&#x27;s Polonia Overture and Albert Lortzing&#x27;s &quot;Der Pole und sein Kind&quot;.

The current official musical score of the national anthem was arranged by Kazimierz Sikorski and published by the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. Sikorski&#x27;s harmonization allows for each vocal version to be performed either &quot;a cappella&quot; or together with any of the instrumental versions. Some orchestra parts, marked in the score as &quot;ad libitum&quot;, may be left out or replaced by other instruments of equivalent musical scale.

In 1908, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, later to become the first Prime Minister of independent Poland, quoted the anthem in a disguised way in his Symphony in B minor &quot;Polonia&quot;. He scored it in duple meter rather than its standard triple meter.

The anthem was quoted by Edward Elgar in his symphonic prelude &quot;Polonia&quot;, composed in 1915.

== Regulations ==
The national anthem is, along with the national coat of arms and the national colors, one of three national symbols defined by the Polish constitution.
As such, it is protected by law which declares that treating the national symbols &quot;with reverence and respect&quot; is the &quot;right and obligation&quot; of every Polish citizen and all state organs, institutions and organizations. The anthem should be performed or reproduced especially at celebrations of national holidays and anniversaries. Civilians should pay respect to the anthem by standing in a dignified manner; additionally, men should uncover their heads. Members of uniformed services should stand at attention; if their uniform includes headgear and they are not standing in an organized group, they should also perform the two-finger salute. The song is required to be played in the key of F-major if played for a public purpose. Color guards pay respect to the anthem by dipping their banners.

== History ==
=== Origin ===


In 1795, after a prolonged decline and despite last-minute attempts at constitutional reforms and armed resistance, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was ultimately partitioned by its three neighbors: Russia, Prussia and Austria. A once vast and powerful empire was effectively erased from the map while monarchs of the partitioning powers pledged never to use the name &quot;Poland&quot; in their official titles. For many, including even leading representatives of the Polish Enlightenment, this new political situation meant an end of the Polish nation. In the words of Hugo Kołłątaj, a notable Polish political thinker of the time, &quot;Poland no longer belonged to currently extant nations,&quot; while historian Tadeusz Czacki declared that Poland &quot;was now effaced from the number of nations.&quot;

Meanwhile, Polish patriots and revolutionaries turned for help to France, Poland&#x27;s traditional ally, which was at war with Austria (member of the First Coalition) at the time. Józef Wybicki was among the leading moderate émigré politicians seeking French aid in re-establishing Polish independence. In 1796, he came up with the idea of creating Polish Legions within the French Revolutionary Army. To this end, he convinced General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, a hero of the Greater Poland campaign of the 1794 Kościuszko Uprising, to come to Paris and present the plan to the French Directory. Dąbrowski was sent by the Directory to Napoleon who was then spreading the French Revolution in northern Italy. In January 1797, the newly created French-controlled Cisalpine Republic accepted Dąbrowski&#x27;s offer and a Polish legion was formed. Dąbrowski and his soldiers hoped to fight against Austria under Napoleon and, subsequently, march across the Austrian territory, &quot;from Italy to Poland&quot;, where they would ignite a national uprising.

In early July 1797, Wybicki arrived in Reggio Emilia where the Polish Legions were then quartered and where he wrote the &quot;Song of the Polish Legions&quot; soon afterwards. He first sung it at a private meeting of Polish officers in the Legions&#x27; headquarters at the episcopal palace in Reggio. The first public performance most probably took place on 16 July 1797 during a military parade in Reggio&#x27;s Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square). On 20 July, it was played again as the Legions were marching off from Reggio to Milan, the Cisalpine capital.

With its heart-lifting lyrics and folk melody, the song soon became a popular tune among Polish legionaries. On 29 August 1797, Dąbrowski already wrote to Wybicki from Bologna: &quot;soldiers gain more and more taste for your song.&quot; It appealed to both officers, usually émigré noblemen, and simple soldiers, most of whom were Galician peasants who had been drafted into the Austrian army and captured as POWs by the French. The last stanza, referring to Kościuszko, who famously fought for freedom of the entire nation rather than the nobility alone, and the &quot;scythes of Racławice&quot;, seems to be directed particularly at the latter. Wybicki may have even hoped for Kościuszko to arrive in Italy and personally lead the Legions which might explain why the chorus &quot;March, march, Dąbrowski&quot; is not repeated after the last stanza. At that time Wybicki was not yet aware that Kościuszko had already returned to Philadelphia.

=== Rising popularity ===
The song became popular in Poland as soon as late 1797 and quickly became an object of variations and modifications. A variant from 1798 introduced some stylistic changes, which have since become standard, such as replacing (&#x27;not dead&#x27;) with (&#x27;not perished&#x27;) or (&#x27;to Poland from the Italian land&#x27;) with (&#x27;from the Italian land to Poland&#x27;). It also added four new stanzas, now forgotten, written from the viewpoint of Polish patriots waiting for General Dąbrowski to bring freedom and human rights to Poland.

The ultimate fate of the Polish Legions in Italy was different from that promised by Wybicki&#x27;s song. Rather than coming back to Poland, they were exploited by the French government to quell uprisings in Italy, Germany and, later, in Haiti where they were decimated by war and disease. Polish national hopes were revived with the outbreak of a Franco-Prussian war (part of the War of the Fourth Coalition) in 1806. Napoleon called Dąbrowski and Wybicki to come back from Italy and help gather support for the French army in Polish-populated parts of Prussia. On 6 November 1806, both generals arrived in Poznań, enthusiastically greeted by locals singing &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot;. The ensuing Greater Poland Uprising and Napoleon&#x27;s victory over Russian forces at Friedland led to the creation of a French-controlled Polish puppet state known as the Duchy of Warsaw.

&quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot; was one of the most popular patriotic songs in the duchy, stopping short of becoming that entity&#x27;s national anthem. Among other occasions, it was sung in Warsaw on 16 June 1807 to celebrate the battle of Friedland, in Kraków as it was liberated by Prince Józef Poniatowski on 19 July 1809, and at a ball in Warsaw on 23 December 1809, the birthday of Frederick Augustus, King of Saxony and Duke of Warsaw. On the occasion of Dąbrowski&#x27;s name day on 25 December 1810 in Poznań, Dąbrowski and Wybicki led the mazurka to the tune of &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot;. Although the melody of Wybicki&#x27;s song remained unchanged and widely known, the lyrics kept changing. With the signing of a Franco-Russian alliance at Tilsit in 1807, the fourth stanza, specifically mentioning Russians as Poland&#x27;s enemies, was removed. The last stanza, referring to Kościuszko, who had grown suspicious of Napoleon and refused to lend his support to the emperor&#x27;s war in Poland, met the same fate.

The anthem is mentioned twice in &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;, the Polish national epic written by Adam Mickiewicz in 1834, but set in the years 1811–1812. The author makes the first reference to the song when Tadeusz, the main protagonist, returns home and, recalling childhood memories, pulls the string of a chiming clock to hear the &quot;old Dąbrowski&#x27;s Mazurka&quot; once again. Music boxes and musical clocks playing the melody of &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot; belonged to popular patriotic paraphernalia of that time. The song appears in the epic poem again when Jankiel, a Jewish dulcimerist and ardent Polish patriot, plays the mazurka in the presence of General Dąbrowski himself.

With Napoleon&#x27;s defeat and the Congress of Vienna in 1815 came a century of foreign domination over Poland interspersed with occasional bursts of armed rebellion. &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot; continued to be sung throughout that period, especially during national uprisings. During the November Uprising against Russia in 1830–1831, the song was chanted in the battlefields of Stoczek, Olszynka Grochowska and Iganie. In peacetime, Polish patriots performed it at homes, official functions and political demonstrations. New variants of the song, of various artistic value and length of life, abounded. At least 16 alternative versions were penned during the November Uprising alone. At times, Dąbrowski&#x27;s name was replaced by other national heroes: from Józef Chłopicki during the November Uprising to Józef Piłsudski during the First World War to Władysław Sikorski during the Second World War. New lyrics were also written in regional dialects of Polish, from Silesia to Ermland and Masuria. A variant known as &quot;Marsz Polonii&quot; (&#x27;March of Polonia&#x27;) spread among Polish immigrants in the Americas.

Mass political emigration following the defeat of the November Uprising, known as the Great Emigration, brought &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot; to Western Europe. It soon found favor from Britain to France to Germany where it was performed as a token of sympathy with the Polish cause. It was also highly esteemed in Central Europe where various, mostly Slavic, peoples struggling for their own independence, looked to the Polish anthem for inspiration. Back in Poland, however, especially in the parts under Russian and Prussian rule, it was becoming increasingly risky to sing the anthem in public. Polish patriotic songs were banned in Prussia in 1850; between 1873 and 1911, German courts passed 44 sentences for singing such songs, 20 of which were specifically for singing &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot;. When Poland was part of the Russian Empire, public performance of the song often ended with police intervention.

=== Choice of national anthem ===
When Poland re-emerged as an independent state after World War I in 1918, it had to make a decision about its national symbols. While the coat of arms and the flag were officially adopted as soon as 1919, the question of a national anthem had to wait. Apart from &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot;, there were other popular patriotic songs which could compete for the status of an official national anthem.


In the Middle Ages, the role of a national anthem was played by hymns. Among them were &quot;Bogurodzica&quot; (&#x27;Mother of God&#x27;), one of the oldest (11th–12th century) known literary texts in Polish, and the Latin &quot;Gaude Mater Polonia&quot; (&#x27;Rejoice, Mother Poland&#x27;), written in the 13th century to celebrate the canonization of Bishop Stanislaus of Szczepanów, the patron saint of Poland. Both were chanted on special occasions and on battlefields. The latter is sung nowadays at university ceremonies. During the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, several songs, both religious and secular, were written with the specific purpose of creating a new national anthem. Examples include the 16th-century Latin prayer (&#x27;Prayer for the Commonwealth and the King&#x27;) by a Calvinist poet, Andrzej Trzeciński, and &quot; (&#x27;Hymn to the Love of the Fatherland&#x27;) written in 1744 by Prince-Bishop Ignacy Krasicki. They failed, however, to win substantial favor with the populace. Another candidate was &quot; (&#x27;God Is Born&#x27;), whose melody was originally a 16th-century coronation polonaise (dance) for Polish kings.

The official anthem of the Russian-controlled Congress Kingdom of Poland was &quot;&quot; (&#x27;National Song to the King&#x27;s Prosperity&#x27;) written in 1816 by Alojzy Feliński and Jan Kaszewski. Initially unpopular, it evolved in the early 1860s into an important religious and patriotic hymn. The final verse, which originally begged &quot;Save, O Lord, our King&quot;, was substituted with &quot;Return us, O Lord, our free Fatherland&quot; while the melody was replaced with that of a Marian hymn. The result, known today as &quot;Boże, coś Polskę&quot; (from the first lines &quot;Boże! Coś Polskę przez tak liczne wieki / Otaczał blaskiem potęgi i chwały...&quot;, &quot;Lord! Who for so many ages enclosed Poland with the light of power and glory...&quot;), has been sung in Polish churches ever since, with the final verse alternating between &quot;Return...&quot; and &quot;Bless, O Lord, our free Fatherland&quot;, depending on Poland&#x27;s political situation.

A national song that was particularly popular during the November Uprising was &quot;Warszawianka&quot;, originally written in French as &quot; by Casimir Delavigne, with melody by Karol Kurpiński. The song praised Polish insurgents taking their ideals from the French July Revolution of 1830. A peasant rebellion against Polish nobles, which took place in western Galicia in 1846 and was encouraged by Austrian authorities who wished to thwart a new uprising attempt, moved Kornel Ujejski to write a mournful chorale entitled &quot; (&#x27;With the Smoke of Fires&#x27;). With the music composed by , it became one of the most popular national songs of the time, although it declined into obscurity during the 20th century. In 1908, Maria Konopnicka and Feliks Nowowiejski created &quot;Rota&quot; (&#x27;Oath&#x27;), a song protesting against the oppression of the Polish population of the German Empire, who were subject to eviction from their land and forced assimilation. First publicly performed in 1910, during a quincentennial celebration of the Polish–Lithuanian victory over the Teutonic Knights at Grunwald, it too became one of the most treasured national Polish songs.

At the inauguration of the United Nations in 1945, no delegation from Poland had been invited. The Polish pianist Artur Rubinstein, who was to perform the opening concert at the inauguration, began the concert by stating his deep disappointment that the conference did not have a delegation from Poland. Rubinstein later described becoming overwhelmed by a blind fury and angrily pointing out to the public the absence of the Polish flag. He then sat down to the piano and played &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot; loudly and slowly, repeating the final part in a great thunderous &quot;forte&quot;. When he had finished, the public rose to their feet and gave him a great ovation.

Over 60 years later, on 22 September 2005, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, President of Poland, said: 

== Influence ==
During the European Revolutions of 1848, &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot; won favor throughout Europe as a revolutionary anthem. This led the Slovak poet Samo Tomášik to write the ethnic anthem, &quot;Hej, Sloveni&quot;, based on the melody of the Polish national anthem. It was later adopted by the Prague Slavic Congress as the Pan-Slavic Anthem. During the Second World War, a translation of this anthem became the national anthem of Yugoslavia, and later, Serbia and Montenegro. The similarity of the anthems sometimes caused confusion during these countries&#x27; football or volleyball matches. However, after the 2006 split between the two, neither Serbia nor Montenegro kept the song as its national anthem, instead choosing &quot;Bože pravde&quot; and &quot;Oj, svijetla majska zoro&quot; respectively. The Polish national anthem is also notable for influencing the lyrics of the national anthem of Ukraine.

The line &quot;Poland is not yet lost&quot; has become proverbial in some languages. For example, in German, &quot;&quot; is a common saying meaning all is not lost&#x27;. In Swedish, the similar phrase &quot;&quot; is also used in the same context.

Additionally, the Italian anthem &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; contains a reference to the Partitions of Poland by Prussia, Austria and Russia, due to the two countries&#x27; close relations.

<text>Mahjong ( ) is a tile-based game that was developed in the 19th century in China and has spread throughout the world since the early 20th century. It is played by four players (with some three-player variations found in parts of China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and Southeast Asia). The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout East and Southeast Asia and have also become popular in Western countries. The game has also been adapted into a widespread online entertainment. Similar to the Western card game rummy, mahjong is a game of skill, strategy, and luck. To distinguish it from mahjong solitaire, it is sometimes referred to as mahjong rummy.

The game is played with a set of 144 tiles based on Chinese characters and symbols, although many regional variations may omit some tiles or add unique ones. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn, players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four melds (or sets) and a pair (eye). A player can also win with a small class of special hands. While many variations of mahjong exist, most variations have some basic rules in common including how a piece is drawn and discarded, the use of suits (numbered tiles) and honors (winds and dragons), the basic kinds of melds allowed, how to deal the tiles and the order of play. Beyond these basic common rules, numerous regional variations exist which may have notably different criteria for legal melds and winning hands, radically different scoring systems and even elaborate extra rules. A group of players may introduce their own house rules which can notably change the feel of play.

== Etymology ==
The game was originally called ()meaning sparrowwhich is still used in several Chinese languages, mostly in the south, such as Cantonese and Hokkien. It is said that the clacking of tiles during shuffling resembles the chattering of sparrows. It has also been suggested that the name came from an evolution of an earlier card game called Madiao from which mahjong tiles were adapted. In Chinese, denotes a form of guerilla warfare tactics colloquially called &#x27;sparrow warfare (tactics)&#x27;. Other languages, such as Sichuanese, Shanghainese and Standard Mandarin, now call the game (), which is a nasal erhua form of the original name. Its name is similar in other languages, except in Thai, where it is called (), a calque meaning &quot;sparrow cards&quot;.

== Old Hong Kong mahjong rules ==

There are many highly varied versions of mahjong both in rules and tiles used. &quot;Old Hong Kong mahjong&quot; uses the same basic features and rules as the majority of the different variations of the game. This form of mahjong uses all of the tiles of the most commonly available sets, includes no exotic complex rules, and has a relatively small set of scoring sets/hands with a simple scoring system. For these reasons Hong Kong mahjong is a suitable variation for the introduction of game rules and play and is the focus of this article.

=== Game equipment ===
Old Hong Kong mahjong is played with a standard set of 144 mahjong tiles (though cards may be used). Sets often include counters (to keep score), dice (to decide how to deal), and a marker to show who the dealer is and which round is being played. Some sets include racks to hold the tiles, especially if they are larger or smaller than standard tiles or have an odd shape. Mahjong sets originating from the United States, Japan or Southeast Asia will likely have extra tiles or specialized markings.

The tiles are split into three categories: suited, honors, and bonus tiles.

==== Suited tiles ====
Suited tiles are divided into three suits and each are numbered from 1 to 9. The suits are bamboos, dots, and characters. There are four identical copies of each suited tile totaling 108 tiles.
The bamboo suit is also known as &quot;sticks&quot;, &quot;strings&quot; or &quot;bams&quot; suit; the first tile usually has a bird (traditionally, a peacock or sparrow) instead of a single bamboo. The dots suit is also known as the &quot;wheels&quot;, &quot;circles&quot;, &quot;coins&quot;, &quot;stones&quot;, &quot;marbles&quot; or &quot;balls&quot; suit. The characters suit is also known as the &quot;myriads&quot;, &quot;cracks&quot; or &quot;numbers&quot; suit since the top characters are numbers in the Chinese writing system, and the bottom characters (in traditional Chinese characters) are the Chinese character for &quot;ten thousand&quot;.

==== Honors tiles ====
There are two different sets of honors tiles: winds and dragons. The winds are east, south, west, and north, beginning with east. The dragons are red, green, and white. The white dragon has a blue or black frame on the face of the piece or in some sets is entirely blank. These tiles have no numerical sequence like the suited tiles (for example the bamboo pieces number 1 to 9). Like the suited tiles, there are four identical copies of each honors tile, for a total of 28 honors tiles.


==== Bonus tiles ====
There are two sets of bonus tiles: flowers and seasons. The flower and season tiles play a unique role in the mechanics of the game. When drawn, the bonus tile is not added into a player&#x27;s hand but are instead set aside and kept near the player&#x27;s other tiles for scoring purposes should they win the hand, and an extra tile is drawn in replacement of the bonus tile.

In addition, unlike the suited and honors tiles, there is only one of each bonus tile, so there are a total of four flower and four season tiles in the set. The tiles have a different artistic rendering of a specific type of flower or season.

It is not necessary to know the names or the Chinese characters of each bonus tile, only the number, as this is associated with a specific direction, and the player receives bonus points when the bonus tile matches the seat direction. There is no relation between the bonus tile &quot;bamboo&quot; flower and the bamboo suit of suited tiles (e.g. 4 bamboo). In traditional Chinese culture, the Four Gentlemen are the plum (winter), orchid (spring), bamboo (summer), and chrysanthemum (autumn) which are regarded as the representative plants of those seasons, but people regard it as plum blossom (spring), orchid (summer), chrysanthemum (autumn) and bamboo (winter) now.

=== Choosing table positions and first dealer ===

Before the game can begin, players need to be assigned one of the wind positions at the table - those being (in counterclockwise order) East, South, West, and North. East will also be the first dealer. Play proceeds in this counterclockwise order.

There are a variety of ways to determine positions. For example, one way is to have each player roll dice and assign East to the player that rolls the highest, South to the second-highest, and so on. Another way is to shuffle the 4 wind tiles face down and have each player choose one, determining their position.

=== Hands, rounds, and matches ===

A match consists of four rounds, each representing a &quot;prevailing wind&quot;, starting with East. Once the first round is completed, a second round begins with South as the prevailing wind, and so on. Wind position is significant in that it affects the scoring of the game. A mahjong set with winds in play will usually include a separate prevailing wind marker (typically a die marked with the wind characters in a holder).

In each round at least four hands are played, with each player taking the position of dealer. In the first hand of each round, Player 1 (winner of the dice toss) is East and therefore dealer. In the second hand, Player 2 takes the East position, shifting the seat winds amongst the players counter-clockwise (though players do not physically move their chairs). This continues until all four players have been East (dealer). A marker is used to mark which player is East and often the round number. (In sets with racks, a rack may be marked differently to denote the dealer.)

Whenever a player in the East position (dealer) wins a hand, or if there is no winner (a draw or &quot;goulash hand&quot;), an extra hand is played with the same seating positions and prevailing wind as in the previous hand. This means that a match may potentially have no limit to the number of hands played (though some players will set a limit of three consecutive hands allowed with the same seat positions and prevailing wind).

Example of games:

=== Dealing tiles ===

====Shuffling tiles====

All tiles are placed face down on the table and are shuffled. By convention all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces around the table rigorously and loudly for a lengthy period. Tiles may get flipped up during this process and players should flip them facing down as soon as possible to avoid identifying the location of the revealed tiles.

====Stacking tiles====
Each player then stacks a row of 18 tiles, two tiles high in front of them (for a total of 36 tiles). Players then push each side of their stack together to form a square wall.

Regular players usually place their stacks in a slightly diagonal position (about 20 to 30 degrees counter-clockwise); the right end of their stack is pushed slightly further in to the centre of the table to meet almost the middle of the stack of the player on the right. This creates a smaller square wall the length of about half of each stack, with walls extended away from each corner of the square. The diagonally positioned stacks and a smaller square creates a bigger space for players&#x27; tiles and also makes an ergonomic position for drawing tiles from the stack.

====Drawing tiles====

The dealer throws three dice in the square wall and sums up the total. Counting counter-clockwise so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south (player to the right) is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player&#x27;s quarter of the wall is chosen. Some house rules may use only two dice but have double throws to increase randomness. In the case of double throws, the player of the chosen wall makes the second throw.

Using the same total on the dice (or the total of the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts the stacks of tiles from right to left. (For double throws, the count may extend to the left side player&#x27;s stack.) This determines the location where the &#x27;deck&#x27; of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer draws four tiles for their hand. Proceeding in counter-clockwise order, players take turns drawing blocks of four tiles (so that the stacks decrease clockwise) until each player (including the dealer) has 12 tiles. Each player then draws one last tile to make a 13-tile hand. The tile to be drawn is always the topmost tile left of the cut.

Dealing does not have to be strictly this way and may be done quite differently based on house rules. Tiles may flip over when being dealt and players should agree in advance on how to deal with the problem. Solutions include having the dealer penalised points, shuffling the turned over piece back into the wall somehow, allowing the player to whom the tiles were dealt to take the piece or not (meaning the dealer must take it as their 14th piece), or other house rules.

Each player now sets aside any flowers or seasons they may have drawn and takes turns to draw replacement tiles from the wall in the counter-clockwise direction from the dealer. If a player gets any flowers or seasons tiles in the replacement draw, the players must wait for the next turn to draw replacement tiles.

====Game play starts====
The dealer draws a piece from the wall in clockwise direction, adding it to their hand. Typically, this draw is performed during the initial deal to speed up play. If this does not complete a legal hand, the dealer then discards a piece (throwing it into the middle of the wall with no particular order in mind).

=== Rules ===
Each player in turn, in counter-clockwise direction, draws a tile from the wall; as long as the tile drawn is not one of the bonus tiles, the player proceeds to discard a tile (either the tile just drawn, or a tile in the hand) to maintain a hand of 13. The discarded tile is thrown into the centre and, if desired, the player announces out loud what the piece is. The other players have an opportunity to seize the discarded tile; if no one takes it, the turn continues to the next player. Play continues this way until one player has a legal winning hand and calls out the win (each region does this call differently—no Asian version uses the word &quot;mahjong&quot; to signal a win) while revealing their hand.

There are four different ways that regular order of play can be interrupted:
#A bonus tile (flower or season) is drawn
#A meld (pong, kong, or chow) is made from a discard
#Going mahjong (declaring a winning hand)
#Robbing a kong

During play, each player&#x27;s hand should always be 13 tiles (meaning in each turn a tile must be picked up and another discarded). The count of 13 tiles do not include any bonus tiles (flowers and seasons), which are set to the side, nor does it include the fourth added piece of a kong. If a player is seen to have fewer or more than 13 tiles in their hand outside of their turn they are penalised.

==== Legal hand ====
A winning hand consists of 14 tiles. Since players always have 13 tiles in their hand during play, they must win by either drawing a piece from the wall that completes a 14-tile hand (&quot;winning from the wall&quot;) or claiming a discard from another player which completes a 14-tile hand (&quot;winning by discard&quot;). The winning hand is made of four &quot;melds&quot; (a specific pattern of three pieces) and the &quot;eyes&quot; (a pair of identical pieces). The exceptions to this rule are the special hands listed below.

Most players play with a table minimum, meaning a winning hand must score a minimum number of points (which can be seen in the scoring section). In Hong Kong mahjong the most common point set is three, but can be higher or lower depending on house rules.

==== Melds ====
Melds are groups of tiles within the player&#x27;s hand, consisting of either a pong (three identical tiles), a kong (four identical tiles), a chow (three suited tiles in numerical sequence), or eyes (two identical tiles needed in a winning hand). Melds may be formed by drawing a tile from the wall, or by seizing another player&#x27;s discard. There are rules governing which player has priority for a discard, and whether the meld should be exposed (displayed to all players) or remain concealed, depending on the manner in which the meld is formed.

==== Interruption of play ====
The regular counter-clockwise order of turns may be interrupted for four events:

===== 1. Flower or season =====
Whenever a player draws a flower or season, it is announced and then placed to the side (it is not considered a part of the 13-tile hand, but in the event that player wins, they may earn bonus points for them) and the last tile of the wall is drawn as a replacement tile so that the player has the 14 pieces needed before their discard. This may happen successively in a player&#x27;s turn.

===== 2. Melding another player&#x27;s discard =====
When a player discards a tile, other players may steal the tile to complete a meld. Stealing tiles has both advantages (quickly forming a winning hand and scoring extra points) and disadvantages (being forced to reveal part of one&#x27;s hand to other players and not being able to change the meld once declared).

When a meld (pong, kong, or chow) is declared through a discard, the player must state the type of meld to be declared and expose the meld by placing the three (or four) tiles face up. The player must then discard a tile, and play continues to the right. If the player who melds a discard is not directly after the discarder (in order of play), one or two players will essentially miss their turn as play continues counter-clockwise from the player who declared the meld.

If multiple players call for a discarded tile, priority for the discard depends on the declared action of the player stealing the discard.

# Highest priority goes to the player who needs the discarded tile to win the hand. A player may take the tile to win the hand from any other player.
# Next priority goes to the player who declares a pong or kong using the discard. A player who calls for a pong or kong may take the discard from any other player. Only one player can be in this position because there are only four of any tile in a mahjong set.
# Last priority goes to the player who declares a chow using the discard. Players may only call for a chow from the discard of the player immediately prior to them unless the tile is the final one required to win the hand.

===== 3. Winning a hand =====
The act of winning a hand interrupts play to assess the validity of the hand won. Upon confirmation, the player is awarded the hand&#x27;s value per the specific game&#x27;s rule.

======From a discard======
If at any point in the game a player can use another player&#x27;s discard to complete a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they declare a win and reveal their winning hand. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If more than one player can use a discard to win the hand, there are multiple ways to handle the situation based on agreed table rules: The players might count the points they would win with the discard and the winner is the one with the higher score, the winner might simply be the player closest to the discarder in order of turn, or multiple players may be granted the win simultaneously.

======From the wall======
Alternatively, a player may also win by drawing a tile that completes a legal hand. This is called &quot;winning from the wall&quot;. In Hong Kong mahjong, winning from the wall doubles the number of base points each loser must pay.

======False Win======
Technically, the declaration for winning a hand may be done at any time. However, the player must have a complete and legal hand. Otherwise, the player is penalized. The penalty depends on table rules. The player may forfeit points to the other players. Another potential penalty is the player who called out the false win must play the rest of the hand with their tiles face up on the table so other players can see them (open hand). Some methods apply the penalty at the end of the entire game. Again, the table rules dictate the enforcement of the penalty.

===== 4. Robbing a kong =====
A rarely occurring and high-scoring feature of Hong Kong mahjong is a move called robbing the kong. If a player declares a kong by adding a fourth piece to a melded pong but another player can use that piece to complete a hand, the completing player takes priority to win the hand and may steal that piece from the player who intended to declare the kong.

==== Examples of winning hands ====
Below are two examples of winning hands. A winning hand must consist of four melds (pongs, kongs, or chows) and a pair (eyes) and must also score the agreed table minimum.

Most players include table variations in their games, of which some non-standard are included. The hands of &quot;seven different pairs&quot; and &quot;13 orphans&quot; are examples which do not have four melds and the eyes. They are described in more detail below.

==== Repeated hands ====

If the dealer wins the hand, they will remain the dealer and an extra hand is played in addition to the minimum 16 hands in a match.

An extra hand is also played if there is no winner by the time all the tiles in the wall have been drawn. When there is no winner it is known as a &quot;goulash hand&quot;. Depending on table rules, the winner of the next game may take an agreed number of points from each player, carrying over the points from the non-winning hand to the winning one. If there are two or three goulash hands in a row then the winner would collect a considerable number of points from each player on top of their scoring hand. Because extra hands may be played every time a dealer wins or if there is a goulash hand, a match of 16 hands can easily become a match of 20 or even much more.

As table rules add a large amount of flexibility for players, they can choose to disregard the rule of extra hands and pass on the dealership regardless of who wins or if it results in a goulash hand. This puts a maximum estimated limit on the game duration and provides some amount of predictability.

====Rhythm of play====
Players may agree on table rules if the pace of the game is brisk or leisurely. For brisk games players may agree that a couple seconds after a discard are allowed for a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; before the next player picks up from the wall. Usually it is agreed once the next player has waited the duration of the &quot;window of opportunity&quot; and draws a tile from the wall, the previous discard is lost and cannot be claimed.

=== Scoring ===
Old Hong Kong scoring is relatively simple. There is only one winner (or if there is a draw the hand is replayed). The winner must have a legal hand that meets the minimum &quot;faan&quot; points agreed to in advance (not including any bonus points). Only the winner scores, and the other players pay the winner various sums. After each hand ends, the winner counts their &quot;faan&quot; points.
* &quot;Faan&quot; points depend on:
** The composition of the entire hand
** How the hand was won
** Bonus tiles
** Special patterns
** A few other special criteria.
* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum &quot;faan&quot; value agreed in advance (often 3). Bonus tiles and a few other elements are not included in the minimum &quot;faan&quot; value a player needs to form a legal winning hand. For example, in a three &quot;faan&quot; minimum game, if a player has two &quot;faan&quot; points and one bonus point, the player has not met the proper requirements to win and will need to gain another &quot;faan&quot; point before calling a win. Though the bonus points cannot be included in the minimum points needed to win, they are included in the overall score after a player wins.
* The other players do not score their hand. Once the winner has added their points (&quot;faan&quot; points plus bonus points), the points must be converted into base points (the chart is below). These base points represent how much the opponents pay to the winner
* Players then pay the winner (in money or when not gambling with &quot;chips or points&quot;) based on three factors:
** The base points (&quot;faan&quot; points and bonus points converted into a payment unit)
** If the player won from the wall (doubles the points)
** If the player was the dealer (doubles the points).

==== Concealed vs. revealed meld and hand ====

A concealed meld is one that contains no tiles stolen from another player&#x27;s discard. A concealed hand is one made up of only concealed melds. Many variations distinguish between a concealed hand (winning from the wall) and a semi concealed hand (the last tile is a stolen discard). In most mahjong variations having a concealed hand can be valuable in scoring. Hong Kong mahjong does not award concealed melds/hands as generously as others. Concealed hands only the case with a few limit hands or half-limit hands (thirteen orphans, heavenly gates, four concealed pongs) as well as a complete hand (seven pairs) and over several melds (three concealed pongs).

==== &quot;Faan&quot; value ====

===== Basic &quot;faan&quot; value =====
A winning hand must include an agreed minimum amount of &quot;faan&quot; value (often 3). Some examples of scoring include:

===== Bonus &quot;faan&quot; =====


A player only scores a bonus &quot;faan&quot; for flowers or seasons if it is their own flower or season (East=1, South=2, West=3 and North=4) or if the player has all four flowers or all four seasons (scoring 5 &quot;faan&quot; in total).

==== Payment ====

The losers pay the winning player points based on several criteria and depending on whether the game is for fun or for money. How points are reckoned is agreed by players beforehand. For example, they can keep a tally, exchange chips, or pay one another with money. The &quot;faan&quot; value of a hand is converted into base points which are then used to calculate the points the losers pay the winner. The table is progressive, doubling the number of base points when reaching a certain &quot;faan&quot; point target. The following is the Old Hong Kong simplified table; for other tables, see Hong Kong mahjong scoring rules.

This table is based on play where 3 &quot;faan&quot; is the minimum needed in order to win with a legal hand. If a player has 3 &quot;faan&quot;, then their hand is worth one base point. A winning hand with 9 &quot;faan&quot; is worth four base points. Losing players must give the winning player the value of these base points. The following special cases result in doubled base points:
* If the winner wins from the wall, their base points are doubled.
* If the hand was won by discard, the discarder doubles the amount they owe the winner.
* If the winner is east, all losers double the base points.
* If the east player is a losing player, they pay double the points to the winner.

If two of these criteria apply to any player, they must double and then redouble the points owed to the winner.

===== Examples =====
Hong Kong mahjong is essentially a payment system of doubling and redoubling, where winning from the wall adds great value to the final payment and where the dealer is highly rewarded or penalised if they win or lose.

===== Limit hands =====
In Hong Kong mahjong there are a series of &quot;limit hands&quot;. These are exceptional hands, difficult to obtain, and are very valuable in point scoring. As many table rules put a limit on the number of points a winner&#x27;s hand can score, full limit hands score that maximum. Table rules dictate if these rare and special hands are allowed, which ones, and the limit for scoring. A common scoring limit is 64 points, which is the highest base points doubled twice. A winner receives the scoring limit from each player without any doubling.

Some limit hands by necessity must be completely concealed (not discards used) or semi-concealed (the only discard used is the one needed to win). This includes the 13 orphans, 4 concealed pongs, heavenly hand and earthly hand. It is usually expected that the heavenly gates hand be concealed or semi-concealed. As for the dragon limit hands and the great winds, table rules dictate whether the hand must be concealed or not. Some table rules claim that a semi-concealed hand (winning from a discard) scores a half-limit.

Some groups also play with the &quot;great flowers&quot; rule. If a player picks up all four flowers and all four seasons during their hand, they instantly win the hand and receive the maximum points from all of the players. This is exceptionally rare.

In all the hands that require pongs, each pong can be replaced by the corresponding kong.

==== Other examples of high-scoring hands ====

== Variations ==

Variations may have far more complicated scoring systems, add or remove tiles, and include far more scoring elements and limit hands.

In many places, players often observe one version and are either unaware of other variations or claim that different versions are incorrect. In mainland China alone, there are over thirty variants. Many variations today differ only by scoring.
===Chinese variants===
* Changsha mahjong is widely played in Hunan Province. Like Wuhan mahjong, players need to obtain special Jong consisting of only tiles of two, five or eight. Changsha mahjong forbids using winds and some special tiles, those tiles are first drawn out from the table when playing. Winners each round get a special drawing session for bonuses, usually doubling the score.
* Chinese classical mahjong is the oldest surviving variety of mahjong and was the version introduced to America in the 1920s under various names. It has a small, loyal following in the West, although few play it in Asia. All players score and it is possible to score higher than the winner.
* Competition mahjong is an international standard founded by All-China Sports Federation in July 1998 that some mahjong societies have adopted for competition play and in some cases for all play. It includes a large variety of different scoring rules in a way that emphasizes strategy and calculation ability.
* Fujian mahjong, thirteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. No dragons. Winds are treated as bonuses.
* Harbin mahjong, popular in northeastern China, using only 108 suit and 4 red dragon tiles. The player&#x27;s hand must meet a set of few conditions (e.g. at least one chow / pong, at least one terminal or red dragon, etc.) and be declared &quot;ready&quot; in order to win, with points earned by discard or self-draw and a bonus tile revealed when the player wins.
* Hong Kong mahjong or Cantonese mahjong is a more common form of mahjong, differing in minor scoring details from the Chinese Classical variety. It does not allow multiple players to win from a single discard.
* Shenyang mahjong, a fast-paced version with 13-tile hands. Valid winning hands must contain all 3 suits, honor or terminal tiles, and at least one open pung.
* is a growing variety, particularly in southern China, disallowing chow melds, and using only the suited tiles. Play continues until a loser is decided or a draw. It can be played very quickly.
* &#x27;, or Lisi&quot;&quot;&#x27; (): the players must win with the first four blocks drawn which are placed separately in front of the others. These four blocks cannot be touched until the player has a ready hand.
* using normally seven jokers, with special scoring such as &quot;joker-free&quot;, &quot;joker-waiting-pair&quot;, &quot;catch-5&quot;, &quot;dragon&quot;, &quot;joker-suited-dragon&quot;.
* Wuhan mahjong is growing rapidly and become popular in southern China. It is different from other parts of China such that it has a tile that can be used as everything called Laizi, and the player has to have a set of special two tiles, namely two, five, eight, as prerequisite for winning. Another variation has become the new trend. Special tiles need to be discarded.
* Xiangyang mahjong is played with three players, and without winds, seasons, flowers and one suit of dots, bamboo and characters. It places special emphasis on the 5 tile giving extra points for any hand made using a 5 tile.

===Other variants===
* American mahjong is a derivative of mahjong, standardized and regulated by the U.S.-based National Mah Jongg League, Inc. and the American Mah-Jongg Association. Unlike other forms of Mahjong, permitted &quot;legal&quot; hands are changed annually through a published card that must be purchased by players from one of the sponsoring organizational bodies. It uses joker tiles, the Charleston, plus melds of five or more tiles, treats bonus tiles as honors, and eschews the chow and the notion of a standard hand. Purists claim that this makes American mahjong a separate game. In addition, the NMJL and AMJA variations, which have minor scoring differences, are commonly referred to as &quot;mahjongg&quot; or &quot;mah-jongg&quot; (with 2 Gs, often hyphenated).
* is the variety prevalent in Taiwan and involves hands of sixteen tiles (as opposed to the thirteen-tile hands in other versions), features bonuses for dealers and recurring dealerships, and allows multiple players to win from a single discard.
* Japanese classical mahjong is still used in tournaments. It is closer to the Chinese classical scoring system but only the winner scores.
* Japanese mahjong is a standardized form of mahjong in Japan and South Korea, and is also found prevalently in video games. In addition to scoring changes, the rules of &quot;rīchi&quot; (ready hand) and &quot;dora&quot; (bonus tiles) are unique highlights of this variant. In addition, tile discards are specifically arranged in front of each player by discard order, to take discarded tiles into account during play. Some rules replace some number 5 tiles with red tiles so that they can eventually get more value.
* Korean mahjong is unique in many ways and is an excellent version for three players. One suit is omitted completely (usually the bamboo set or 2–8 of bamboo) as well as the seasons. The scoring is simpler and the play is faster. No melded chows are allowed and concealed hands are common. Riichi (much like its Japanese cousin) is an integral part of the game as well.
* Pussers bones is a fast-moving variant developed by sailors in the Royal Australian Navy. It uses an alternative vocabulary, such as &quot;Eddie&quot;, &quot;Sammy&quot;, &quot;Wally&quot;, and &quot;Normie&quot;, instead of &quot;East&quot;, &quot;South&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, and &quot;North&quot; respectively.
* Singaporean mahjong and Malaysian mahjong are two similar variants with much in common with Hong Kong mahjong. Unique elements are the use of four animal bonus tiles (cat, mouse, cockerel, and centipede) as well as certain alternatives in the scoring rules, which allow payouts midway through the game if certain conditions (such as a &quot;kong&quot;) are met. Melds may also be presented in a form different from most other variations.
* South African mahjong is a variant of Cantonese mahjong. It is very similar in terms of game play and follows most of the rules and regulations of Cantonese mahjong. However, there are some minor differences in scoring, e.g. the limit on the maximum points a hand can be rewarded is three or four &quot;faan&quot; depending on the &quot;house&quot; rules. A chicken hand (gai wu) is normally considered a value hand. Depending on the house rules flowers may also be used to boost scoring.
* Thai mahjong has eight specialized jokers with eight extra flowers and eight animals for a total of 168 tiles.
* Vietnamese mahjong has the same eight specialized jokers but with only eight different extra flowers for a total of 160 tiles. A modern variant triplicates or quadruplicates the jokers for a total of 176 or 184 tiles.
* Western classical mahjong is a descendant of the version of mahjong introduced by Babcock to America in the 1920s. Today, this term largely refers to the &quot;Wright-Patterson&quot; rules, used in the U.S. military, and other similar American-made variants that are closer to the Babcock rules.
* Three player mahjong (or 3-&quot;ka&quot;) is a simplified three-person mahjong that involves hands of 13 tiles (with a total of 84 tiles on the table) and may use jokers depending on the variation. Any rule set can be adapted for three players; however, this is far more common and accepted in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. It usually eliminates one suit entirely, or tiles 2–8 in one suit leaving only the terminals. It needs fewer people to start a game and the turnaround time of a game is short—hence, it is considered a fast game. In some versions there is a jackpot for winning in which whoever accumulates a point of 10 is considered to hit the jackpot or whoever scores three hidden hands first. The Malaysian and Korean versions drop one wind and may include a seat dragon.

=== Equipment ===

==== Tables ====

Mahjong playing surfaces are typically square and small enough to be within arm&#x27;s length of all equipment. The edges are raised to prevent tiles from sliding off and the surface is covered in felt to limit wear on the tiles. Automatic dealing tables, often used for high stakes playing and tournaments, are able to shuffle tiles, build walls, and randomize dice. It is an elaborate device built into a table which uses two alternating sets of tiles . It shuffles one set of tiles while the players play on the other set. After the round is finished the tiles are dropped into the table and the standby wall raises upwards.

====Tiles====
The following chart shows the most generic set of tiles
There are variations that feature specific use of tiles. Some three-player versions remove the North wind and one Chinese provincial version has no honors. Korean mahjong removes the bamboo suit or at least its numbers 2–8 so that terminals can be used. Japanese mahjong rarely uses flowers or seasons. The seasons are removed in Korean mahjong, while many Southeast Asian sets have more flower series.

==== Wild cards and jokers ====

Some mahjong variants accept wildcard tiles. The wildcard tiles are decided at the beginning of the game by choosing one random tile. The wild card could be the immediately following tile on the wall, after distributing tiles to all players, or it could also be separately decided by a dice throw. Wildcard tiles cannot be discarded and can only replace tiles in chows. Wildcard tiles cannot replace tiles in pongs and kongs. For example, if a character 4 is chosen, then character 4 and the next sequential tile, character 5, can be used as wild cards in this round. (When the wildcard indicator is chosen and exposed, only 3 tiles remain of the same denomination, so the next tile in the suit will also be used as a wildcard, adding to 7 wildcard tiles for 4 players.) Also, if a tile numbered 9 is the indicator, the suits circle back to 1, after 9. Thus, the number 9 and 1 are wild cards.

Also, if the chosen tile is not in the suited tiles, the wild cards are decided in rules:

The bonus tiles are not available for wild cards.

A feature of several variations of mahjong, most notably in American mahjong, is the notion of some number of Joker tiles. They may be used as a wild card: a substitute for any tile in a hand, or, in some variations, only tiles in melds. Another variation is that the Joker tile may &quot;not&quot; be used for melding. Depending on the variation, a player may replace a Joker tile that is part of an exposed meld belonging to any player with the tile it represents.

Rules governing discarding Joker tiles also exist; some variations permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of any tile, and others only permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of the previously discarded tile (or the absence of a tile, if it is the first discard).

Joker tiles may or may not affect scoring, depending on the variation. Some special hands may require the use of Joker tiles (for example, to represent a &quot;fifth tile&quot; of a certain suited or honor tile).

In American mahjong, it is illegal to pass Jokers during the Charleston.

===== Flowers =====
Japanese rule sets discourage the use of flowers and seasons. Korean rules and three-player mahjong in the Korean/Japanese tradition use only flowers. In Singapore and Malaysia an extra set of bonus tiles of four animals are used. The rule set includes a unique function in that players who get two specific animals get a one-time immediate payout from all players. In Taiwanese mahjong, getting all eight flowers and seasons constitutes an automatic win of the hand and specific payout from all players.

Four of the flower tiles represent the four noble plants of Confucian reckoning:
* 🀢 plum,
* 🀣 orchid,
* 🀥 chrysanthemum,
* and 🀤 bamboo.

The other 4 flower tiles (or season tiles) represent seasons:
* 🀦 spring,
* 🀧 summer,
* 🀨 autumn,
* and 🀩 winter.

These animal tiles are used in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and local variations. They represent the cat, mouse, rooster and centipede. Like flower tiles, they also function as bonus tiles. However, as they have no corresponding seat position, any player who draws one of these gets a bonus point.

===== Walls =====
All tiles are placed face down and shuffled. Each player then stacks a row of tiles two tiles high in front of them, the length of the row depending on the number of tiles in use:
* 136 tiles: 17 stacks for each player
** Suits of circles, bamboos, and characters + winds + dragons
* 144 tiles: 18 stacks for each player
* 148 tiles: 19 stacks for dealer and player opposite, 18 for rest
* 152 tiles: 19 stacks for each player

====Dice, markers, and counting pieces====

Depending on the variation, two or three dice are usually used to decide what part of the wall to start dealing from. They are six-sided dice, traditionally but not necessarily Chinese dice with red one and four pips.

The dealer marker is a round or square object that the dealer places to the side to remind players who the dealer is. The wind marker may be used which indicates the current prevailing wind. In some cases the dealer marker and the wind marker are represented by one large marker, usually a small wheel where one can swivel the outer circle to indicate the prevailing wind (which the dealer holds onto), a cube with the four winds placed onto four of the sides which can be placed in a hollow square (the dealer holds onto it), or a cylinder locked into frame which can be rolled to expose the wind on the top. Japanese mahjong, especially in a gambling environment, may optionally use four yakitori markers to indicate which players have not won a hand yet and has to pay a penalty.

There are a variety of counting pieces used in different countries. They range from Chinese or Japanese counting sticks (thin sticks with various dots on them to represent various points), jetons, play money, paper and pencil, or various apps on touchscreen devices used to calculate and keep scores.

=== Rules ===
Japanese and Korean mahjong have some special rules. A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already discarded that piece, where players&#x27; discards are kept in neat rows in front of them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.
Taiwanese mahjong adds three tiles to a hand requiring a 5th set to be formed, making a clean hand or all-pong hand very difficult to procure.
American mahjong has distinctive game mechanics and the article on American mahjong details these. Some differences include many special patterns, a different scoring system and the use of jokers and five-of-a-kind.

==== Charleston ====
In the American variations it is required that, before each hand begins, a Charleston be enacted. In the first exchange, three tiles are passed to the player on one&#x27;s right; in the next exchange, the tiles are passed to the player opposite, followed by three tiles passed to the left. If all players are in agreement, a second Charleston is performed; however, any player may decide to stop passing after the first Charleston is complete. The Charleston is followed by an optional pass to the player across of one, two, or three tiles. The Charleston, a distinctive feature of American mahjong, may have been borrowed from card games such as Hearts.

=== Hands ===
Many variations have specific hands, some of which are common while some are optional depending on regions and players. One example is the Pure Green hand made of chows or pongs using 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of bamboo and green dragon.

==== Ready hands ====
When a hand is one tile short of winning (for example: , waiting for: , , or , as can be the eyes), the hand is said to be a ready hand, or more figuratively, &quot;on the pot&quot;. The player holding a ready hand is said to be &quot;waiting&quot; for certain tiles. It is common to be waiting for two or three tiles, and some variations award points for a hand that is waiting for one tile. In 13-tile mahjong, the largest number of tiles for which a player can wait is 13 (the &quot;thirteen wonders&quot;, or &quot;13 orphans&quot;, a nonstandard special hand). Ready hands must be declared in some variations of mahjong, while other variations prohibit the same.

Some variations of mahjong, most notably Japanese and Korean ones, allow a player to declare . A declaration of &quot;rīchi&quot; is a promise that any tile drawn by the player is immediately discarded unless it constitutes a win. Standard requirements for &quot;rīchi&quot; are that the hand be &quot;closed&quot; or have no melds declared (other than a concealed kong) and that players already have points for declaration of &quot;rīchi&quot;. A player who declares &quot;rīchi&quot; and wins usually receives a point bonus for their hand directly, and a player who won with &quot;rīchi&quot; also has the advantage to open the inner dora which leads to higher possibilities to match such a card, thus has more chance to grant additional bonus. However, a player who declares &quot;rīchi&quot; and loses is usually penalised in some fashion. Declaring a nonexistent &quot;rīchi&quot; is also penalised in some way.

In some variations, a situation in which all four players declare a &quot;rīchi&quot; is an automatic drawn game, as it reduces the game down to pure luck, i.e., who gets their needed tile first.

=== Draws ===
If only the dead wall remains (or if no dead wall exists and the wall is depleted) and no one has won, the hand is drawn or &quot;goulashed&quot;. A new hand begins, and depending on the variant, the Game Wind may change. For example, in most playing circles in Singapore, if there is at least one kong when the hand is a draw, the following player of the dealer becomes the next dealer; otherwise, the dealer remains dealer.

Japanese mahjong has a special rule called sanchahō, which is, if three players claim the same discard in order to win, the hand is drawn. One reason for this is that there are cases in which bars of 1,000 points for declaring &quot;rīchi&quot; cannot be divided by three. The rule is treated the same as &quot;abortive draws&quot;.

==== Abortive draws ====
In Japanese mahjong, rules allow abortive draws to be declared while tiles are still available. They can be declared under the following conditions:
* On a player&#x27;s first turn when no meld has been declared yet, if a player has nine different terminal (also known as major) or honor tiles, the player may declare the hand to be drawn (for example, , but could also go for the nonstandard &quot;thirteen wonders&quot; hand as well).
* Four winds&#x27; barrier: On the first turn without any meld declarations, if all 4 players discard the same Wind tile, the hand is drawn.
* Yonin rīchi: If all four players declare &quot;rīchi&quot;, the hand is drawn.
* Four kongs&#x27; abort: The hand is drawn when the fourth kong is declared, unless all four kongs were declared by a single player. Still, the hand is drawn when another player declares a fifth kong.

===Scoring===
Scoring in mahjong involves points, with a monetary value for points agreed upon by players. Although in many variations scoreless hands are possible, many require that hands be of some point value in order to win the hand.

While the basic rules are more or less the same throughout mahjong, the greatest divergence between variations lies in the scoring systems. Like the rules, there is a generalized system of scoring, based on the method of winning and the winning hand, from which Chinese and Japanese base their roots. American mahjong generally has greatly divergent scoring rules, as well as greatly divergent general rules.

Because of the large differences between the various systems of scoring (especially for Chinese variants), groups of players will often agree on particular scoring rules before a game.

====Points====
Points (terminology of which differs from variation to variation) are obtained by matching the winning hand with different criteria scoring different values. The points obtained may be modified into scores for each player using some (typically exponential) functions. Some criteria may be also in terms of both points and score.

In many variations the dealer receives no scoring bonus and does not maintain their turn by winning or a dead hand.

In classical mahjong all players score points. Points are given for sets and hand composition and winning bonuses, doubled and redoubled for basic patterns. Sometimes a loser may score more points than a winner. Japanese mahjong has a complex scoring system with several stages of scoring, rules and exceptions, evening out scores and bonus points at the end of a match. Korean mahjong has a simple scoring system where only winner scores without any form of doubling.

Some variations give points for concealed hands, in which case no melds are made except by winning on a discard.

In Old Hong Kong mahjong:
* Only the winner scores points.
* Winning hands are scored by totaling the point value of each element in the hand. Points are distinct from the actual payment received from each player.
* The winner receives points (also known as &quot;faan&quot; among some players) for:
** Individual melds,
** The composition of the entire hand,
** How the hand was won,
** Bonus tiles,
** Special patterns,
** A few other special criteria.
* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum points agreed in advance (often 3).
* Bonus points are separate from the minimum points a player needs to win.
* If a player goes mahjong with a legal and minimum hand, their hand is scored by adding their points and bonus points together.
* The payment received from each player depends on three factors:
** The point value of the hand,
** If the player won from a discard or from the wall, and
** If the player was the dealer or not.

=== Comparison ===
===Mahjong solitaire===

A single player game employs the tiles of mahjong, usually played on computers or devices. Gameplay is entirely unrelated to mahjong or its variations and is a recent invention. The game involves stacking tiles face up in various elaborate patterns and removing uncovered matching tiles at the end of rows.

== Competition ==
In 1998, in the interest of dissociating illegal gambling from Mahjong, the China State Sports Commission published a new set of rules, now generally referred to as Chinese Official rules or International Tournament rules (). The principles of the new, wholesome Mahjong are no gambling, no drinking, and no smoking. In international tournaments, players are often grouped in teams to emphasize that Mahjong from now on is considered a sport.

The new rules are highly pattern-based. The rulebook contains 81 combinations, based on patterns and scoring elements popular in classic and modern regional Chinese variants; some table practices of Japan have also been adopted. Points for flower tiles (each flower is worth one point) may not be added until the player has scored eight points. The winner of a game receives the score from the player who discards the winning tile, plus eight basic points from each player; in the case of &quot;zimo&quot; (self-drawn win), they receive the value of this round plus eight points from all players.

The new rules were first used in an international tournament in Tokyo, where, in 2002, the first global tournament in mahjong was organized by the Mahjong Museum, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, and the city council of Ningbo, China. One hundred players participated, mainly from Japan and China, but also from Europe and the United States. Mai Hatsune, from Japan, became the first world champion. The following year saw the first annual China Mahjong Championship, held in Hainan; the next two annual tournaments were held in Hong Kong and Beijing. Most players were Chinese; players from other nations attended as well.

In 2005, the first Open European Mahjong Championship was held in the Netherlands, with 108 players. The competition was won by Masato Chiba from Japan. The second European championship in Copenhagen (2007) was attended by 136 players and won by Danish player Martin Wedel Jacobsen. The first Online European Mahjong Championship was held on the Mahjong Time server in 2007, with 64 players, and the winner was Juliani Leo, from the U.S., and the Best European Player was Gerda van Oorschot, from the Netherlands. The Third Open European Mahjong Championship 2009 at Baden/Vienna, Austria, was won by Japanese player Koji Idota, while runner-up Bo Lang from Switzerland became European Champion. There were 152 participants.

In 2006, the World Mahjong Organization (WMO) was founded in Beijing, China, with the cooperation of, amongst others, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee (JMOC) and the European Mahjong Association (EMA). This organization held its first World Mahjong Championship in November 2007 in the Chinese town of Chengdu, attended by 144 participants from all over the world. It was won by Li Li, a Chinese student at Tsinghua University. The next World Championship took place in Utrecht, the Netherlands, 27 to 29 August 2010.

Other major international tournaments include the Mahjong International League&#x27;s World Mahjong Sports Games and the privately sponsored World Series Of Mahjong.

American mahjong tournaments are held in virtually every state—the largest is in Las Vegas, Nevada, twice a year, and in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by Mah Jongg Madness (MJM), and an annual cruise is hosted by the National Mah Jongg League and MJM. MJM tournaments host between 150 and 500 participants at these larger events; there are several smaller-scale, but equally successful, tournaments held annually by other hosts. Prize pools are based on the number participating. Rules are based on the National Mah Jongg League standard rules.

== History ==

Mahjong is based on draw-and-discard card games that were popular in 18th and 19th century China, some of which are still popular today. They were played with a stripped deck of money-suited cards. Each deck is divided into three suits of Cash or coins, Strings of cash, and Myriads of strings. There are nine ranks in each suit. In addition, there are three wild cards: Red flower, White flower, and Old thousand. Depending on the game, there are multiple copies of each card.

Games scholar David Parlett has written that the Western card games Conquian and Rummy share a common origin with Mahjong. All these games involve players drawing and discarding tiles or cards to make melds. Khanhoo is an early example of such a game. The most likely ancestor to Mahjong was &quot;pènghú&quot; which was played with 120 or 150 cards. During the late 19th century, &quot;pènghú&quot; was used interchangeably with &quot;máquè&quot; in both card and tile form.

It is not known when the conversion from cards to tiles took place precisely but it most likely occurred in the middle of the 19th century. The earliest surviving tile sets date to around 1870 and were acquired in Fuzhou, Shanghai, and Ningbo. These sets differ from modern ones in several ways, there were no &quot;flower&quot; and &quot;fā&quot; (&quot;green dragon&quot;) tiles. In their place were &quot;king&quot; tiles for heaven, earth, man, and harmony and also for each of the 4 &quot;winds&quot; which may have acted as bonus tiles. In the contemporaneous Himly set, there were no &quot;zhōng&quot; (&quot;red dragon&quot;) tiles either. Instead there were the wild cards known as Cash Flower, String Flower, and Myriad Flower plus an additional tile, the king of everything. These early jokers are still found in the Vietnamese and Thai sets. They may have been removed as the tiles share the same titles as the leaders of the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864). For example, Hong Xiuquan was the self-styled &quot;Heavenly King of Great Peace&quot; and his top subordinates were called east king, south king, west king, and north king.

The ban on gambling after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic in 1949 led to a decline in playing. The game itself was banned during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). Today, it is a favorite pastime in China and other Chinese-speaking communities.

=== Mahjong in the West ===
The first Western records about mahjong seem to correspond to the papers of British Consul General F.E.B. Harvey, around the time when he served as consul in Ningbo, during the 1860s. He mentions in his papers making the acquaintance of an English-fluent, rank-three official under the Daoguang Emperor, Chen Yumen, who taught him the game. In the same writings he details the rules he was taught by Chen. In 1895, British sinologist William Henry Wilkinson wrote a paper which mentioned a set of cards known in central China by the name of &quot;ma chioh&quot;, literally, hemp sparrow, which he maintained was the origin of the term Mahjong. He did not explain the dialect of the originator or region specific etymology of this information. By 1910, there were written accounts in many languages, including French and Japanese.

The game was imported to the United States in the 1920s. The first Mahjong sets sold in the U.S. were sold by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch starting in 1920. It became a success in Washington, D.C., and the co-owner of the company, Ezra Fitch, sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy every Mahjong set they could find. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch sold a total of 12,000 Mahjong sets. Mahjong became a central part of cultural bonding for Chinese Americans in the 1920s and &#x27;30s in Chinatown, Manhattan and was part of community building for suburban American Jewish women in the 1940s and 50s.

Also in 1920, Joseph Park Babcock published his book &quot;Rules of Mah-Jongg&quot;, also known as the &quot;red book&quot;. This was the earliest version of Mahjong known in America. Babcock had learned Mahjong while living in China. His rules simplified the game to make it easier for Americans to take up, and his version was common through the Mahjong fad of the 1920s. Later, when the 1920s fad died out, many of Babcock&#x27;s simplifications were abandoned.

The game has taken on a number of trademarked names, such as &quot;Pung Chow&quot; and the &quot;Game of Thousand Intelligences&quot;. Mahjong nights in America often involved dressing and decorating rooms in Chinese style. Several hit songs were recorded during the Mahjong fad, most notably &quot;Since Ma Is Playing Mah Jong&quot; by Eddie Cantor.

Many variants of Mahjong developed during this period. By the 1930s, many revisions of the rules developed that were substantially different from Babcock&#x27;s classical version (including some that were considered fundamentals in other variants, such as the notion of a standard hand). Standardization came with the formation of the National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) in 1937, along with the first American Mahjong rulebook, &quot;Maajh: The American Version of the Ancient Chinese Game&quot;, written by NMJL&#x27;s first president and co-founder, Viola L. Cecil. In 1999, a second organization was formed, the American Mah Jongg Association.

In the United Kingdom, British author Alan D. Millington revived the Chinese classical game of the 1920s with his book &quot;The Complete Book of Mah-jongg&quot; (1977). This handbook includes a formal rules set for the game.

=== Current development ===
There are many governing bodies which often host exhibition games and tournaments for modern and traditional Mahjong gaming.

Mahjong, as of 2010, is the most popular table game in Japan. As of 2008, there were approximately 7.6 million Mahjong players in Japan and an estimated 8,900 Mahjong parlors did ¥300 billion (converting to US$2.8 billion according to exchange rates for 30 April 2020) in sales. There are several manga and anime (e.g. &quot;Saki&quot; and &quot;Akagi&quot;) devoted to dramatic and comic situations involving Mahjong. Since the 1980s, hundreds of different Mahjong arcade machines in Japanese video arcades have been created, including strip versions. Newer units can connect with other arcade machines across the Internet.

Mahjong culture is still deeply ingrained in the Chinese community. Sam Hui wrote Cantopop songs using Mahjong as their themes, and Hong Kong movies have often included scenes of Mahjong games. Many gambling movies have been filmed in Hong Kong, and a recent subgenre is the Mahjong movie.
Although the popularity of the game in China is still broad, since 1949, mahjong was frowned upon by the government because it is seen as a means of gambling addiction, an issue that the government always sought to tackle.

Prolonged playing of Mahjong may trigger epileptic seizures according to a 2007 study. To date there are 23 reported cases of Mahjong-induced seizures in the English medical literature. Some doctors speculate that this may be due to stress and complex manual movement correlated with intense brain function similar to playing chess or card games such as poker.

Studies by doctors have also shown in Hong Kong that the game is beneficial for individuals suffering from dementia or cognitive memory difficulties, leading to the development of Mahjong therapy.

Researchers have also used artificial intelligence techniques to develop Mahjong-playing agents using neural networks and reinforcement learning. They have shown that a self-learning machine can be trained to compete with some of the best Richi Mahjong players.

== Superstitions ==
Even though both skill and chance play a fundamental role in the game, there is no shortage of superstitions in which players believe where they sit, how they hold their pieces or objects they have on their person will somehow affect the outcome. For example, players will try to find seats with the best feng shui or wear their lucky clothing or trinkets. Some believe that specific pieces (one dot, for example) bode bad luck if received in their opening hand.

More elaborate superstitions in mahjong range from those found in the game poker, such as not counting one&#x27;s wins and losses, to the comical, such as changing one&#x27;s undergarments after a loss. As with all superstitions in gaming, none of them have been properly demonstrated as effective, though, for some, the rituals have become an integral part of the game experience and its aesthetics.
