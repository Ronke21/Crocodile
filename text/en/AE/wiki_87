<text>Pharaoh (, ; Egyptian: &quot;&quot;; ; Biblical Hebrew: &quot;Parʿō&quot;) was the title of the monarch of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty () until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Republic in 30 BCE. However, regardless of gender, &quot;king&quot; was the term used most frequently by the ancient Egyptians for their monarchs through the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty during the New Kingdom. The earliest confirmed instances of &quot;pharaoh&quot; used contemporaneously for a ruler were a letter to Akhenaten (reigned –1336 BCE) or an inscription possibly referring to Thutmose III (–1425 BCE).

In the early dynasties, ancient Egyptian kings had as many as three titles: the Horus, the Sedge and Bee (), and the Two Ladies or Nebty () name. The Golden Horus and the nomen titles were added later.

In Egyptian society, religion was central to everyday life. One of the roles of the king was as an intermediary between the deities and the people. The king thus was deputised for the deities in a role that was both as civil and religious administrator. The king owned all of the land in Egypt, enacted laws, collected taxes, and served as commander-in-chief of the military. Religiously, the king officiated over religious ceremonies and chose the sites of new temples. The king was responsible for maintaining Maat (), or cosmic order, balance, and justice, and part of this included going to war when necessary to defend the country or attacking others when it was believed that this would contribute to Maat, such as to obtain resources.

During the early days prior to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, the Deshret or the &quot;Red Crown&quot;, was a representation of the kingdom of Lower Egypt, while the Hedjet, the &quot;White Crown&quot;, was worn by the kings of Upper Egypt. After the unification of both kingdoms, the Pschent, the combination of both the red and white crowns became the official crown of the pharaoh. With time new headdresses were introduced during different dynasties such as the Khat, Nemes, Atef, Hemhem crown, and Khepresh. At times, a combination of these headdresses or crowns worn together was depicted.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;pharaoh&quot; ultimately derives from the Egyptian compound &#x27;, * &quot;great house&quot;, written with the two biliteral hieroglyphs &#x27; &quot;house&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;column&quot;, here meaning &quot;great&quot; or &quot;high&quot;. It was the title of the royal palace and was used only in larger phrases such as &quot; pr-ꜥꜣ&quot; &quot;Courtier of the High House&quot;, with specific reference to the buildings of the court or palace. From the Twelfth Dynasty onward, the word appears in a wish formula &quot;Great House, May it Live, Prosper, and be in Health&quot;, but again only with reference to the royal palace and not a person.

Sometime during the era of the New Kingdom, &quot;pharaoh&quot; became the form of address for a person who was king. The earliest confirmed instance where &quot;pr ꜥꜣ&quot; is used specifically to address the ruler is in a letter to the eighteenth dynasty king, Akhenaten (reigned –1336 BCE), that is addressed to &quot;Great House, L, W, H, the Lord&quot;. However, there is a possibility that the title &quot;pr ꜥꜣ&quot; first might have been applied personally to Thutmose III (–1425 BCE), depending on whether an inscription on the Temple of Armant may be confirmed to refer to that king. During the Eighteenth dynasty (sixteenth to fourteenth centuries BCE) the title pharaoh was employed as a reverential designation of the ruler. About the late Twenty-first Dynasty (tenth century BCE), however, instead of being used alone and originally just for the palace, it began to be added to the other titles before the name of the king, and from the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty (eighth to seventh centuries BCE, during the declining Third Intermediate Period) it was, at least in ordinary use, the only epithet prefixed to the royal appellative.

From the Nineteenth dynasty onward &quot;pr-ꜥꜣ&quot; on its own, was used as regularly as , &quot;Majesty&quot;. The term, therefore, evolved from a word specifically referring to a building to a respectful designation for the ruler presiding in that building, particularly by the time of the Twenty-Second Dynasty and Twenty-third Dynasty.

The first dated appearance of the title &quot;pharaoh&quot; being attached to a ruler&#x27;s name occurs in Year 17 of Siamun (tenth century BCE) on a fragment from the Karnak Priestly Annals, a religious document. Here, an induction of an individual to the Amun priesthood is dated specifically to the reign of &quot;Pharaoh Siamun&quot;. This new practice was continued under his successor, Psusennes II, and the subsequent kings of the twenty-second dynasty. For instance, the Large Dakhla stela is specifically dated to Year 5 of king &quot;Pharaoh Shoshenq, beloved of Amun&quot;, whom all Egyptologists concur was Shoshenq I—the founder of the Twenty-second Dynasty—including Alan Gardiner in his original 1933 publication of this stela. Shoshenq I was the second successor of Siamun. Meanwhile, the traditional custom of referring to the sovereign as, &quot;pr-ˤ3&quot;, continued in official Egyptian narratives.

The title is reconstructed to have been pronounced in the Late Egyptian language, from which the Greek historian Herodotus derived the name of one of the Egyptian kings, . In the Hebrew Bible, the title also occurs as ; from that, in the Septuagint, , and then in Late Latin &quot;pharaō&quot;, both &quot;-n&quot; stem nouns. The Qur&#x27;an likewise spells it &quot;firʿawn&quot; with &quot;n&quot; (here, always referring to the one evil king in the Book of Exodus story, by contrast to the good king in surah Yusuf&#x27;s story). The Arabic combines the original ayin from Egyptian along with the &quot;-n&quot; ending from Greek.

In English, the term was at first spelled &quot;Pharao&quot;, but the translators for the King James Bible revived &quot;Pharaoh&quot; with &quot;h&quot; from the Hebrew. Meanwhile, in Egypt, evolved into Sahidic Coptic &quot;pərro&quot; and then &quot;ərro&quot; by rebracketing &quot;p-&quot; as the definite article &quot;the&quot; (from ancient Egyptian &quot;&quot;).

Other notable epithets are &quot;&quot;, translated to &quot;king&quot;; , &quot;Majesty&quot;; &quot;&quot; for &quot;monarch or sovereign&quot;; &quot;&quot; for &quot;lord&quot;; and &quot;&quot; for &quot;ruler&quot;.

== Functions ==

As a central figure of the state, the pharaoh was the obligatory intermediary between the gods and humans. To the former, he ensured the proper performance of rituals in the temples; to the latter, he guaranteed agricultural prosperity, the defense of the territory and impartial justice.

In the sanctuaries, the image of the sovereign is omnipresent through parietal scenes and statues. In this iconography, the pharaoh is invariably represented as the equal of the gods. In the religious speech, he is however only their humble servant, a zealous servant who makes multiple offerings. This piety expresses the hope of a just return of service. Filled with goods, the gods must favorably activate the forces of nature for a common benefit to all Egyptians. The only human being admitted to dialogue with the gods on an equal level, the Pharaoh was the supreme officiant; the first of the priests of the country. More widely, the pharaonic gesture covered all the fields of activity of the collective and ignored the separation of powers. Also, every member of the administration acts only in the name of the royal person, by delegation of power.

From the &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot;, the political actions of the sovereign were framed by a single maxim: &quot;Bring Maat and repel Isfet&quot;, that is to say, promote harmony and repel chaos. As the nurturing father of the people, the Pharaoh ensured prosperity by calling upon the gods to regulate the waters of the Nile, by opening the granaries in case of famine and by guaranteeing a good distribution of arable land. Chief of the armies, the pharaoh was the brave protector of the borders. Like Ra who fights the serpent Apophis, the king of Egypt repels the plunderers of the desert, fights the invading armies and defeats the internal rebels. The Pharaoh was always the sole victor; standing up and knocking out a bunch of prisoners or shooting arrows from his battle chariot. As the only legislator, the laws and decrees he promulgated were seen as inspired by divine wisdom. This legislation, kept in the archives and placed under the responsibility of the vizier, applied to all, for the common good and social agreement.

== Regalia ==
=== Scepters and staves ===

Sceptres and staves were a general symbol of authority in ancient Egypt. One of the earliest royal scepters was discovered in the tomb of Khasekhemwy in Abydos. Kings were also known to carry a staff, and Anedjib is shown on stone vessels carrying a so-called &quot;mks&quot;-staff. The scepter with the longest history seems to be the &quot;heqa&quot;-sceptre, sometimes described as the shepherd&#x27;s crook. The earliest examples of this piece of regalia dates to prehistoric Egypt. A scepter was found in a tomb at Abydos that dates to Naqada III.

Another scepter associated with the king is the &quot;was&quot;-sceptre. This is a long staff mounted with an animal head. The earliest known depictions of the &quot;was&quot;-scepter date to the First Dynasty. The &quot;was&quot;-scepter is shown in the hands of both kings and deities.

The flail later was closely related to the &quot;heqa&quot;-scepter (the crook and flail), but in early representations the king was also depicted solely with the flail, as shown in a late pre-dynastic knife handle that is now in the Metropolitan museum, and on the Narmer Macehead.

=== The Uraeus ===
The earliest evidence known of the Uraeus—a rearing cobra—is from the reign of Den from the first dynasty. The cobra supposedly protected the king by spitting fire at its enemies.

== Crowns and headdresses ==

=== Deshret ===

The red crown of Lower Egypt, the Deshret crown, dates back to pre-dynastic times and symbolised chief ruler. A red crown has been found on a pottery shard from Naqada, and later, Narmer is shown wearing the red crown on both the Narmer Macehead and the Narmer Palette.

=== Hedjet ===
The white crown of Upper Egypt, the Hedjet, was worn in the Predynastic Period by Scorpion II, and, later, by Narmer.

=== Pschent ===
This is the combination of the Deshret and Hedjet crowns into a double crown, called the Pschent crown. It is first documented in the middle of the First Dynasty of Egypt. The earliest depiction may date to the reign of Djet, and is otherwise surely attested during the reign of Den.

=== Khat ===

The &quot;khat&quot; headdress consists of a kind of &quot;kerchief&quot; whose end is tied similarly to a ponytail. The earliest depictions of the &quot;khat&quot; headdress comes from the reign of Den, but is not found again until the reign of Djoser.

=== Nemes ===
The Nemes headdress dates from the time of Djoser. It is the most common type of royal headgear depicted throughout Pharaonic Egypt. Any other type of crown, apart from the Khat headdress, has been commonly depicted on top of the Nemes. The statue from his Serdab in Saqqara shows the king wearing the &quot;nemes&quot; headdress.
=== Atef ===
Osiris is shown to wear the Atef crown, which is an elaborate Hedjet with feathers and disks. Depictions of kings wearing the Atef crown originate from the Old Kingdom.

=== Hemhem ===
The Hemhem crown is usually depicted on top of Nemes, Pschent, or Deshret crowns. It is an ornate, triple Atef with corkscrew sheep horns and usually two uraei. The depiction of this crown begins among New Kingdom rulers during the Early Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.

=== Khepresh ===

Also called the blue crown, the Khepresh crown has been depicted in art since the New Kingdom. It is often depicted being worn in battle, but it was also frequently worn during ceremonies. It used to be called a war crown by many, but modern historians refrain from defining it thus.

=== Physical evidence ===
Egyptologist Bob Brier has noted that despite their widespread depiction in royal portraits, no ancient Egyptian crown has ever been discovered. The tomb of Tutankhamun that was discovered largely intact, contained such royal regalia as a crook and flail, but no crown was found among his funerary equipment. Diadems have been discovered. It is presumed that crowns would have been believed to have magical properties and were used in rituals. Brier&#x27;s speculation is that crowns were religious or state items, so a dead king likely could not retain a crown as a personal possession. The crowns may have been passed along to the successor, much as the crowns of modern monarchies.

== Titles ==

During the Early Dynastic Period kings had three titles. The Horus name is the oldest and dates to the late pre-dynastic period. The Nesu Bity name was added during the First Dynasty. The Nebty name (Two Ladies) was first introduced toward the end of the First Dynasty. The Golden falcon (&quot;bik-nbw&quot;) name is not well understood. The prenomen and nomen were introduced later and are traditionally enclosed in a cartouche. By the Middle Kingdom, the official titulary of the ruler consisted of five names; Horus, Nebty, Golden Horus, nomen, and prenomen for some rulers, only one or two of them may be known.

=== Horus name ===
The Horus name was adopted by the king, when taking the throne. The name was written within a square frame representing the palace, named a serekh. The earliest known example of a serekh dates to the reign of king Ka, before the First Dynasty. The Horus name of several early kings expresses a relationship with Horus. Aha refers to &quot;Horus the fighter&quot;, Djer refers to &quot;Horus the strong&quot;, etc. Later kings express ideals of kingship in their Horus names. Khasekhemwy refers to &quot;Horus: the two powers are at peace&quot;, while Nebra refers to &quot;Horus, Lord of the Sun&quot;.

=== Nesu Bity name ===
The &quot;Nesu Bity&quot; name, also known as prenomen, was one of the new developments from the reign of Den. The name would follow the glyphs for the &quot;Sedge and the Bee&quot;. The title is usually translated as king of Upper and Lower Egypt. The &quot;nsw bity&quot; name may have been the birth name of the king. It was often the name by which kings were recorded in the later annals and king lists.

=== Nebty name ===
The earliest example of a &quot;Nebty&quot; (Two Ladies) name comes from the reign of king Aha from the First Dynasty. The title links the king with the goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt, Nekhbet and Wadjet. The title is preceded by the vulture (Nekhbet) and the cobra (Wadjet) standing on a basket (the neb sign).

=== Golden Horus ===
The Golden Horus or Golden Falcon name was preceded by a falcon on a gold or &quot;nbw&quot; sign. The title may have represented the divine status of the king. The Horus associated with gold may be referring to the idea that the bodies of the deities were made of gold and the pyramids and obelisks are representations of (golden) sun-rays. The gold sign may also be a reference to Nubt, the city of Set. This would suggest that the iconography represents Horus conquering Set.

=== Nomen and prenomen ===
The prenomen and nomen were contained in a cartouche. The prenomen often followed the King of Upper and Lower Egypt (&quot;nsw bity&quot;) or Lord of the Two Lands (&quot;nebtawy&quot;) title. The prenomen often incorporated the name of Re. The nomen often followed the title, Son of Re (&quot;sa-ra&quot;), or the title, Lord of Appearances (&quot;neb-kha&quot;).
== Divinity ==

=== Ancient Egypt ===
In Ancient Egypt, the Pharaoh was often considered to be divine. This precept originated before 3000 BCE and the Egyptian office of divine kingship would go on to influence many other societies and kingdoms, surviving into the modern era. The Pharaoh also became a mediator between the gods and man. This institution represents an innovation over that of Sumerian city-states where, though the clan leader or king mediated between his people and the gods, did not himself represent a god on Earth. The few Sumerian exceptions to this would post-date the origins of this practice in ancient Egypt. For example, the legendary king Gilgamesh, thought to have reigned in Uruk as a contemporary of the Egyptian ruler Djoser, was cast as having had his mother as the Mesopotamian goddess Ninsun alongside his father, the previous human ruler of Uruk. Another Mesopotamian example of a god-king was Naram-Sin of Akkad. During the Early Dynastic Period, the Pharaoh was represented as the divine incarnation of Horus, and the unifier of Upper and Lower Egypt. By the time of Djedefre (26th century BCE), the Pharaoh also ceased to have a father, as his mother was magically impregnated by the solar deity Ra. According to Pyramid Text Utterance 571, &quot;... the King was fashioned by his father Atum before the sky existed, before earth existed, before men existed, before the gods were born, before death existed ...&quot; According to an inscription on the statue of Horemheb (14th–13th centuries BCE): &quot;he [Horemheb] already came out of his mother&#x27;s bosom adorned with the prestige and the divine color ...&quot; Inscriptions regularly described the Pharaoh as the &quot;good god&quot; or &quot;perfect god&quot; (&quot;nfr ntr&quot;). By the time of the New Kingdom, the divinity of the king was imbued as he possessed the manifestation of the god Amun-Re; this was referred to as his &#x27;living royal &quot;ka&quot;&#x27; which he received during the coronation ceremony. The divinity of Pharaoh was still held to during the period of Persian domination of Egypt. The Persian emperor Darius the Great (522–486 BCE) was referred to as a divine being in Egyptian temple texts. Such descriptions continued and were designated to Alexander the Great after his conquest of Egypt, and later still for the rulers of the Ptolemaic Kingdom that succeeded Alexander&#x27;s rule.

=== Classical Greece ===
Descriptions of the divinity of the Pharaoh are much more infrequent in sources from Classical Greece. One Ptolemaic-era hymn describes the divinity of the Pharaoh, though this may reflect Greek notions of divine kingship just as much as it could reflect Egyptian ones. The historian Herodotus explicitly denies this, claiming that Egyptian priests rejected any notion of the divinity of the king. The only explicit classical Greek source which describes the divinity of Pharaoh is contained in the writings of Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BCE, who in turn relies on Hecataeus of Abdera as his source of information. Diodorus slightly contradicts himself in a different passage where he asserts that Darius I was the first ruler of Egypt to be honored as a king.

=== Rabbinic literature ===
Even after the reign of the Egyptian kings and pharaohs, the notion of Pharaoh&#x27;s self-notion as a divine being survived and is described in rabbinic literature. In these sources, the Pharaoh is described as hubristically asserting his own divinity and yet, compared to the one true God, is no more than an impotent human. &quot;Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael&quot;, Shirah 8:32 names Pharaoh among those who proclaimed themselves as gods, alongside Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar. &quot;Genesis Rabbah&quot; 89:3 invokes Pharaoh describing himself as the god over the Nile river. In &quot;Exodus Rabbah&quot; 10:2, Pharaoh boasts that he is the creator and owner of the Nile. God is then said to have responded to this statement by challenging the Pharaoh over who owns the Nile, as God proceeds to create a disaster by bringing forth frogs from it that consume Egypt&#x27;s agriculture. In other midrashic texts, Pharaoh asserts himself as the creator of the universe and even of himself. In the &quot;Tanhuma&quot;, in commentary on Ezekiel 29:9, Pharaoh is said to have proclaimed himself as lord of the universe. Pharaoh is represented as a heretical figure who presents himself as divine, and these texts then claim that his claims were exposed when he had to go to the Nile to relieve himself.

<text>A printing press is a mechanical device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a print medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink. It marked a dramatic improvement on earlier printing methods in which the cloth, paper, or other medium was brushed or rubbed repeatedly to achieve the transfer of ink and accelerated the process. Typically used for texts, the invention and global spread of the printing press was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.

In Germany, around 1440, the goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable-type printing press, which started the Printing Revolution. Modelled on the design of existing screw presses, a single Renaissance movable-type printing press could produce up to 3,600 pages per workday, compared to forty by hand-printing and a few by hand-copying. Gutenberg&#x27;s newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities. His two inventions, the hand mould and the movable-type printing press, together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents in Europe, particularly for shorter print runs.

From Mainz, the movable-type printing press spread within several decades to over 200 cities in a dozen European countries. By 1500, printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than 20 million volumes. In the 16th century, with presses spreading further afield, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies. The earliest press in the Western Hemisphere was established by Spaniards in New Spain in 1539, and by the mid-17th century, the first printing presses arrived in British colonial America in response to the increasing demand for Bibles and other religious literature. The operation of a press became synonymous with the enterprise of printing and lent its name to a new medium of expression and communication, &quot;the press&quot;.

The spread of mechanical movable type printing in Europe in the Renaissance introduced the era of mass communication, which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and (revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation, and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its peoples led to the rise of proto-nationalism and accelerated the development of European vernaculars, to the detriment of Latin&#x27;s status as lingua franca. In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale.

== History ==
=== Economic conditions and intellectual climate ===

The rapid economic and socio-cultural development of late medieval society in Europe created favorable intellectual and technological conditions for Gutenberg&#x27;s improved version of the printing press: the entrepreneurial spirit of emerging capitalism increasingly made its impact on medieval modes of production, fostering economic thinking and improving the efficiency of traditional work processes. The sharp rise of medieval learning and literacy amongst the middle class led to an increased demand for books which the time-consuming hand-copying method fell far short of accommodating.

=== Technological factors ===
Technologies preceding the press that led to the press&#x27;s invention included: manufacturing of paper, development of ink, woodblock printing, and invention of eyeglasses. At the same time, a number of medieval products and technological processes had reached a level of maturity which allowed their potential use for printing purposes. Gutenberg took up these far-flung strands, combined them into one complete and functioning system, and perfected the printing process through all its stages by adding a number of inventions and innovations of his own:

The screw press which allowed direct pressure to be applied on a flat plane was already of great antiquity in Gutenberg&#x27;s time and was used for a wide range of tasks. Introduced in the 1st century AD by the Romans, it was commonly employed in agricultural production for pressing grapes for wine and olives for oil, both of which formed an integral part of the Mediterranean and medieval diet. The device was also used from very early on in urban contexts as a cloth press for printing patterns. Gutenberg may have also been inspired by the paper presses which had spread through the German lands since the late 14th century and which worked on the same mechanical principles.

During the Islamic Golden Age, Arab Muslims were printing texts, including passages from the Qur’an, embracing the Chinese craft of paper making, developed it and adopted it widely in the Muslim world, which led to a major increase in the production of manuscript texts. In Egypt during the Fatimid era, the printing technique was adopted reproducing texts on paper strips by hand and supplying them in various copies to meet the demand.

Gutenberg adopted the basic design, thereby mechanizing the printing process. Printing, however, put a demand on the machine quite different from pressing. Gutenberg adapted the construction so that the pressing power exerted by the platen on the paper was now applied both evenly and with the required sudden elasticity. To speed up the printing process, he introduced a movable undertable with a plane surface on which the sheets could be swiftly changed.
The concept of movable type existed prior to 15th century Europe; sporadic evidence that the typographical principle, the idea of creating a text by reusing individual characters, was known and had been cropping up since the 12th century and possibly before (the oldest known application dating back as far as the Phaistos disc).
The first movable type was invented by Chinese engineer Bi Sheng in the 11th century during the Song dynasty, and a book dating to 1193 recorded the first copper movable type. 

This received limited use compared to woodblock printing. The technology spread outside China, as the oldest printed book using metal movable type was the &quot;Jikji&quot;, printed in Korea in 1377 during the Goryeo era. Other notable examples include the Prüfening inscription from Germany, letter tiles from England and Altarpiece of Pellegrino II in Italy. However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted. Tsuen-Hsuin and Needham, and Briggs and Burke suggest that the movable-type printing in China and Korea was rarely employed.

Gutenberg greatly improved the process by treating typesetting and printing as two separate work steps. A goldsmith by profession, he created his type pieces from a lead-based alloy which suited printing purposes so well that it is still used today. The mass production of metal letters was achieved by his key invention of a special hand mould, the matrix. The Latin alphabet proved to be an enormous advantage in the process because, in contrast to logographic writing systems, it allowed the type-setter to represent any text with a theoretical minimum of only around two dozen different letters.

Another factor conducive to printing arose from the book existing in the format of the codex, which had originated in the Roman period. Considered the most important advance in the history of the book prior to printing itself, the codex had completely replaced the ancient scroll at the onset of the Middle Ages (AD500). The codex holds considerable practical advantages over the scroll format: it is more convenient to read (by turning pages), more compact, and less costly, and both recto and verso sides could be used for writing or printing, unlike the scroll.

A fourth development was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing paper manufacture. The introduction of water-powered paper mills, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282, allowed for a massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese and Muslim papermaking. Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one-sixth of parchment and then falling further. Papermaking centers reached Germany a century later.

Despite this it appears that the final breakthrough of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing. Codices of parchment, which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material, still had a substantial share in Gutenberg&#x27;s edition of the 42-line Bible. After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties which traditional water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an oil-based ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.

== Function and approach ==

A printing press, in its classical form, is a standing mechanism, ranging from long, wide, and tall. The small individual metal letters known as type would be set up by a compositor into the desired lines of text. Several lines of text would be arranged at once and were placed in a wooden frame known as a galley. Once the correct number of pages were composed, the galleys would be laid face up in a frame, also known as a forme, which itself is placed onto a flat stone, &#x27;bed,&#x27; or &#x27;coffin.&#x27; 

The text is inked using two balls, pads mounted on handles. The balls were made of dog skin leather, because it has no pores, and stuffed with sheep&#x27;s wool and were inked. This ink was then applied to the text evenly. One damp piece of paper was then taken from a heap of paper and placed on the tympan. The paper was damp as this lets the type &#x27;bite&#x27; into the paper better. Small pins hold the paper in place. The paper is now held between a frisket and tympan (two frames covered with paper or parchment).

These are folded down, so that the paper lies on the surface of the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a windlass mechanism. A small rotating handle called the &#x27;rounce&#x27; is used to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or &#x27;Devil&#x27;s Tail.&#x27; In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.

The function of the printing press was described by William Skeen in 1872:
== Gutenberg&#x27;s press ==
Johannes Gutenberg&#x27;s work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehn—a man who had previously instructed in gem-cutting—and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill. However, it was not until a 1439 lawsuit against Gutenberg that an official record existed; witnesses&#x27; testimony discussed Gutenberg&#x27;s types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds.

Having previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions, a special matrix enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His type case is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, ligatures, punctuation marks, and so forth.

Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and vellum (high-quality parchment). In the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg made a trial of colour printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies. A later work, the Mainz Psalter of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer, had elaborate red and blue printed initials.

== The Printing Revolution ==

The Printing Revolution occurred when the spread of the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of information and ideas, acting as an &quot;agent of change&quot; through the societies that it reached. Demand for bibles and other religious literature was one of the main drivers of the very rapid initial expansion of printing. Much later, printed literature played a major role in rallying support, and opposition, during the lead-up to the English Civil War, and later still the American and French Revolutions through newspapers, pamphlets and bulletins. The advent of the printing press brought with it issues involving censorship and freedom of the press.

=== Mass production and spread of printed books ===


The invention of mechanical movable type printing led to a huge increase of printing activities across Europe within only a few decades. From a single print shop in Mainz, Germany, printing had spread to no less than around 270 cities in Central, Western and Eastern Europe by the end of the 15th century. As early as 1480, there were printers active in 110 different places in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, England, Bohemia and Poland. From that time on, it is assumed that &quot;the printed book was in universal use in Europe&quot;.

In Italy, a center of early printing, print shops had been established in 77 cities and towns by 1500. At the end of the following century, 151 locations in Italy had seen at one time printing activities, with a total of nearly three thousand printers known to be active. Despite this proliferation, printing centres soon emerged; thus, one third of the Italian printers published in Venice.

By 1500, the printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million copies. In the following century, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.

European printing presses of around 1600 were capable of producing between 1,500 and 3,600 impressions per workday. By comparison, Far Eastern printing, where the back of the paper was manually rubbed to the page, did not exceed an output of forty pages per day.

Of Erasmus&#x27;s work, at least 750,000 copies were sold during his lifetime alone (1469–1536). In the early days of the Reformation, the revolutionary potential of bulk printing took princes and papacy alike by surprise. In the period from 1518 to 1524, the publication of books in Germany alone skyrocketed sevenfold; between 1518 and 1520, Luther&#x27;s tracts were distributed in 300,000 printed copies.

The rapidity of typographical text production, as well as the sharp fall in unit costs, led to the issuing of the first newspapers (see &quot;Relation&quot;) which opened up an entirely new field for conveying up-to-date information to the public.

Incunable are surviving pre-16th century print works which are collected by many of the libraries in Europe and North America.

=== Circulation of information and ideas ===

The printing press was also a factor in the establishment of a community of scientists who could easily communicate their discoveries through the establishment of widely disseminated scholarly journals, helping to bring on the Scientific Revolution. Because of the printing press, authorship became more meaningful and profitable. It was suddenly important who had said or written what, and what the precise formulation and time of composition was. This allowed the exact citing of references, producing the rule, &quot;One Author, one work (title), one piece of information&quot; (Giesecke, 1989; 325). Before, the author was less important, since a copy of Aristotle made in Paris would not be exactly identical to one made in Bologna. For many works prior to the printing press, the name of the author has been entirely lost.

Because the printing process ensured that the same information fell on the same pages, page numbering, tables of contents, and indices became common, though they previously had not been unknown. The process of reading also changed, gradually moving over several centuries from oral readings to silent, private reading. Over the next 200 years, the wider availability of printed materials led to a dramatic rise in the adult literacy rate throughout Europe.

The printing press was an important step towards the democratization of knowledge. Within 50 or 60 years of the invention of the printing press, the entire classical canon had been reprinted and widely promulgated throughout Europe (Eisenstein, 1969; 52). More people had access to knowledge both new and old, more people could discuss these works. Book production became more commercialised, and the first copyright laws were passed. On the other hand, the printing press was criticized for allowing the dissemination of information that may have been incorrect.

A second outgrowth of this popularization of knowledge was the decline of Latin as the language of most published works, to be replaced by the vernacular language of each area, increasing the variety of published works. The printed word also helped to unify and standardize the spelling and syntax of these vernaculars, in effect &#x27;decreasing&#x27; their variability. This rise in importance of national languages as opposed to pan-European Latin is cited as one of the causes of the rise of nationalism in Europe.

A third consequence of popularization of printing was on the economy. The printing press was associated with higher levels of city growth. The publication of trade-related manuals and books teaching techniques like double-entry bookkeeping increased the reliability of trade and led to the decline of merchant guilds and the rise of individual traders.

== Industrial printing presses ==

At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the mechanics of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press were still essentially unchanged, although new materials in its construction, amongst other innovations, had gradually improved its printing efficiency. By 1800, Lord Stanhope had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the printed area. With a capacity of 480 pages per hour, the Stanhope press doubled the output of the old style press. Nonetheless, the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious.

Two ideas altered the design of the printing press radically: First, the use of steam power for running the machinery, and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer Friedrich Koenig in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818. Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig soon met Thomas Bensley and secured financial support for his project in 1807. Patented in 1810, Koenig had designed a steam press &quot;much like a hand press connected to a steam engine.&quot; In April 1811, the first production trial of this model occurred. He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer Andreas Friedrich Bauer.

In 1814, Koenig and Bauer sold two of their first models to &quot;The Times&quot; in London, capable of 1,100 impressions per hour. The first edition so printed was on 28 November 1814. They improved the early model so that it could print on both sides of a sheet at once. This began the long process of making newspapers available to a mass audience, which helped spread literacy. From the 1820s it changed the nature of book production, forcing a greater standardization in titles and other metadata. Their company Koenig &amp; Bauer AG is still one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of printing presses today.

===Rotary press===
The steam-powered rotary printing press, invented in 1843 in the United States by Richard M. Hoe, ultimately allowed millions of copies of a page in a single day. Mass production of printed works flourished after the transition to rolled paper, as continuous feed allowed the presses to run at a much faster pace. Hoe&#x27;s original design operated at up to 2,000 revolutions per hour where each revolution deposited 4 page images, giving the press a throughput of 8,000 pages per hour. By 1891, The New York World and Philadelphia Item were operating presses producing either 90,000 4-page sheets per hour or 48,000 8-page sheets.

In the middle of the 19th century, there was a separate development of jobbing presses, small presses capable of printing small-format pieces such as billheads, letterheads, business cards, and envelopes. Jobbing presses were capable of quick setup, with an average setup time for a small job was under 15 minutes, and quick production. Even on treadle-powered jobbing presses it was considered normal to get 1,000 impressions per hour [iph] with one pressman, with speeds of 1,500 iph often attained on simple envelope work. Job printing emerged as a reasonably cost-effective duplicating solution for commerce at this time.

<text>Patrick Michael Rafter (born 28 December 1972) is an Australian former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), and world No. 6 in doubles. Rafter won eleven ATP Tour-level singles titles, including two majors at the 1997 and 1998 US Opens, as well as two Masters titles. He was also the runner-up at Wimbledon in 2000 and 2001. In doubles, Rafter won ten titles, including a major at the 1999 Australian Open partnering Jonas Björkman, and two Masters titles. 

Rafter became the first man in the Open Era to win the Canada Masters, Cincinnati Masters and the US Open in the same year, a feat repeated only by Andy Roddick in 2003, and Rafael Nadal in 2013. Rafter is the third man in the Open Era to reach at least the semifinals of every major in both singles and doubles, after Rod Laver and Stefan Edberg, and remains the last man to date to accomplish this. He is also been considered to be a sex symbol in the media.

==Tennis career==
Rafter turned professional in 1991. During the course of his career, he twice won the men&#x27;s singles title at the US Open and was twice the runner-up at Wimbledon. He was known for his serve-and-volley style of play.

===Early years (1991–1996)===
Rafter won his first tour-level match in 1993, at Wimbledon. He reached the third round, before losing to Andre Agassi. He also reached the semifinals in Indianapolis. He defeated Pete Sampras in the quarterfinals in three tight sets, before losing to Boris Becker in the semifinals. Rafter finished 1993 with a ranking of 66.

Rafter won his first career singles title in 1994 in Manchester. Prior to 1997, this was the only ATP singles title he had won.

===Breakthrough and stardom (1997–1999)===
Rafter&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1997. At that year&#x27;s French Open, he reached the semifinals, falling in four sets to two time former champion Sergi Bruguera. Then, he surprised many by winning the US Open, defeating Andriy Medvedev, Magnus Norman, Lionel Roux, Andre Agassi, Magnus Larsson, and Michael Chang before beating Greg Rusedski in a four-set final; he was the first non-American to win the title since Stefan Edberg in 1992. This was his first Grand Slam title, and catapulted him ahead of Chang to finish the year ranked #2 in the world (behind only Pete Sampras). The unexpected nature of his US Open title led many, including Hall-of-famer and four-time US Open champion John McEnroe to criticise Rafter as a &quot;one-slam wonder&quot;.

Rafter had a particularly strong year in 1998, winning the Canadian Open and the Cincinnati Masters ─ Andre Agassi (1995), Andy Roddick (2003), and Rafael Nadal (2013) are the only other players to have won both of these tournaments in the same year. Rafter defeated ninth-ranked Richard Krajicek in the Toronto final and second-ranked Pete Sampras in the Cincinnati final. When asked about the difference between himself and Rafter following their titles, Sampras responded, &quot;10 grand slams&quot;. He added that a tennis player must come back and win a Grand Slam again in order to be considered great.

Entering the U.S. Open as the defending champion, Rafter reached the final by defeating Hicham Arazi, Hernán Gumy, David Nainkin, Goran Ivanišević and Jonas Björkman before besting Sampras in a five-set semifinal. Rafter then defended his US Open title by defeating fellow Australian Mark Philippoussis in four sets, committing only five unforced errors throughout the match. Altogether, Rafter won six tournaments in 1998, finishing the year No. 4 in the world.

Rafter won the Australian Open men&#x27;s doubles title in 1999 (partnering Jonas Björkman), making him one of few players in the modern era to win both a singles and doubles Grand Slam title during their career (fellow countryman Lleyton Hewitt would later achieve this feat in 2001). He and Björkman also won a doubles title at the ATP Masters Series event in Canada in 1999. At the 1999 French Open, Rafter drew future world No. 1 and 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer in the first round, making him the first-ever opponent of Federer in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament. Rafter defeated him in four sets. Rafter then reached the Wimbledon semifinals for the first time in 1999, losing in straight sets to Agassi. This was the first of three consecutive years that the two met in the Wimbledon semifinals. July 1999 saw Rafter holding the world No. 1 men&#x27;s singles ranking for one week, making him the shortest-reigning world No. 1 in ATP Tour history. As the two-time defending US Open champion, Rafter lost in the first round of the tournament, retiring in the fifth set against Cédric Pioline after succumbing to shoulder tendinitis. Rafter&#x27;s shoulder injury wound up being serious enough to necessitate surgery.

Due to injury, Rafter was unable to play in the 1999 Davis Cup final won by Australia; however, he won important matches in the earlier rounds to help the team qualify.

===Late career (2000–2003)===

Rafter&#x27;s ranking had fallen to No. 21 by the time he reached the Wimbledon final in July 2000. In the semifinals, he defeated Agassi 7–5, 4–6, 7–5, 4–6, 6–3. The match was hailed as a classic, particularly because of their contrasting playing styles, with Agassi playing primarily from the baseline and Rafter attacking the net. Rafter faced Sampras in the final, who was gunning for a record-breaking seventh Wimbledon title overall (and seven in the past eight years). While Rafter made a strong start to the match and took the first set, after the match he would claim that he had &quot;choked&quot; part way through the second set tie-break, and was then not able to get back into his game. Sampras won in four sets.

Rafter played on the Australian Davis Cup Team that lost in the final in 2000 (to Spain) and 2001 (to France). Rafter played on the Australian teams that won the World Team Cup in 1999 and 2001.

In 2001, Rafter reached the semifinals of the Australian Open. Despite holding a two sets to one lead and having the support of the home crowd, Rafter lost the match to Agassi in five sets. Later in the year, Rafter again reached the Wimbledon final. For the third straight year, he faced Agassi in the semifinals and won in yet another five-setter, 2–6, 6–3, 3–6, 6–2, 8–6. Much like the previous year&#x27;s semifinal, this match also received praise for the quality of play that the two men displayed. The final was originally scheduled to play on the second Sunday but was rescheduled to the third Monday because the other semifinal between Goran Ivanišević and Tim Henman was played on three separate days. In the final he played Ivanišević, who had reached the Wimbledon final three times before but had slid down the rankings to World No. 125 following injury problems. In a five-set struggle that lasted just over three hours, Ivanišević prevailed. He played his last match at the Davis Cup final on rubber, winning the singles but losing the doubles.

Rafter did not play any tour matches in 2002. He spent the year recovering from injuries. In January 2003, he announced his retirement from professional tennis, stating that he had lost all motivation to compete at the top level.

===Comebacks and post-retirement activities===
The 5,500-seat centre court of the Queensland Tennis Centre in Brisbane, Australia, was named &quot;Pat Rafter Arena&quot; in Rafter&#x27;s honour. In 2002, he won the Australian of the Year award. This created some controversy, as he had spent much of his career residing in Bermuda for tax purposes.

Rafter did return at the beginning of the 2004 season to play doubles at two tournaments only; the 2004 Australian Open and the 2004 AAPT Championships (in Adelaide). However, he lost in round one of both events, playing alongside Joshua Eagle.

In 2005, Rafter won the International Club&#x27;s prestigious Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award.

He was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame and inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2006. On Australia Day 2008, Rafter was inducted into the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame.

In 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, Rafter was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as a &quot;sports legend&quot;.

In October 2010, Rafter was announced as Australia&#x27;s Davis Cup captain. Rafter stood down as Australia&#x27;s Davis Cup captain on 29 January 2015. He was succeeded by Wally Masur.

On 12 January 2014, Rafter—then aged 41—announced that he would be partnering current Australian number one Lleyton Hewitt in the doubles draw of the 2014 Australian Open. The comeback, however, was short-lived, as the pair went down in straight sets to eventual runner-ups Eric Butorac and Raven Klaasen in the first round.

====ATP Champions Tour====
At the 2009 AEGON Masters Tennis, Rafter lost his opening round robin match against the 1987 Wimbledon Champion and fellow Aussie Pat Cash 2–6, 6–2, 10–6. In a much anticipated match and replay of the 2001 Wimbledon final, Rafter faced Goran Ivanišević. Rafter won the match when Ivanisevic retired while serving for the opening set, 3–5. Despite his performance, the retirement was enough to push Rafter into the final against Stefan Edberg. In what is described as a spell-binding serve-and-volley showdown, Rafter won the match 6–7, 6–4, 11–9. This represented the first time that Rafter was able to defeat Edberg.

<text>Proportional representation (PR) refers to any electoral system under which subgroups of an electorate are reflected proportionately in the elected body. The concept applies mainly to political divisions (political parties) among voters. The aim of such systems is that all votes cast contribute to the result so that each representative in an assembly is mandated by a roughly equal number of voters, and therefore all votes have equal weight. Under other election systems, a bare plurality or a scant majority are all that are used to elect candidates. PR systems provide balanced representation to different factions, usually defined by parties, reflecting how votes were cast. Where only a choice of parties is allowed, the seats are allocated to parties in proportion to the vote tally or &quot;vote share&quot; each party receives. 

Exact proportionality is never achieved under PR systems, except by chance. The use of electoral thresholds that are intended to limit the influence of small, extreme parties will reduce proportionality in list systems, and any insufficiency of leveling seats will further reduce proportionality in mixed-member proportional or additional-member systems. Small districts with few seats in each that allow localised representation reduce proportionality in STV or list PR systems. Other sources of disproportionality are electoral tactics, such as party splitting in some MMP systems. 

Nonetheless, PR systems approximate proportionality much better than other systems and are more (or completely) resistant to gerrymandering and other forms of manipulation.

Some PR systems do not necessitate the use of parties; others do. The most widely used families of PR electoral systems are party-list PR, used in 85 countries; mixed-member PR (MMP), used in 7 countries; and the single transferable vote (STV), used in Ireland, Malta, the Australian Senate, and Indian Rajya Sabha. Proportional representation systems are used at all levels of government and are also used for elections to non-governmental bodies, such as corporate boards.
== Basics ==
&quot;Proportional representation&quot; refers to the general principle found in any electoral system in which the popularly chosen subgroups (parties) of an electorate are reflected proportionately in the elected body. To achieve that intended effect, proportional electoral systems need to either have more than one seat in each district (e.g. single transferable vote), or have some form of compensatory seats (e.g. mixed-member proportional representation apportionment methods). A legislative body (e.g. assembly, parliament) may be elected proportionally, whereas there is no need for a single office (e.g. a president, or mayor) to be elected proportionately if no votes are for parties (subgroups).

In the European Parliament, for instance, each member state has a number of seats that is (roughly) proportional to its population, enabling geographical proportional representation. For these elections, all European Union (EU) countries also must use a proportional electoral system (enabling political proportional representation): When &quot;n&quot;% of the electorate support a particular political party or set of candidates as their favourite, then roughly &quot;n&quot;% of seats are allotted to that party or those candidates. All PR systems aim to provide some form of equal representation for votes but may differ in their approaches on how they achieve this.

=== How party-list PR works ===
Party-list PR is the most commonly used version of proportional representation. Voters cast votes for parties and each party is allocated seats based on its party share.

Some party-list PR systems use overall country-wide vote counts; others count vote shares in separate parts of the country and allocate seats in each part according to that specific vote count. Some use both.

List PR involves parties in the election process. Voters do not primarily vote for candidates (persons), but for &quot;electoral lists&quot; (or &quot;party lists&quot;), which are lists of candidates that parties put forward. The mechanism that allocates seats to the parties/lists is how these systems achieve proportionality. Once this is done, the candidates who take the seats are based on the order in which they appear on the list. This is the basic, closed list version of list PR.

An example election where the assembly has 200 seats to be filled is presented below. Every voter casts their vote for the list created by their favourite party and the results of the election are as follows (popular vote). Under party-list PR, every party gets a number of seats proportional to their share of the popular vote.
This is done by a proportional formula or method; for example, the Sainte-Laguë methodthese are the same methods that may be used to allocate seats for geographic proportional representation (for example, how many seats each states gets in the US House of Representatives). Votes and seats often cannot be mathematically perfectly allocated, so some amount of rounding has to be done. The various methods deal with this in different ways, although the difference is reduced if there are many seatsfor example, if the whole country is one district. Party-list PR is also more complicated in reality than in the example, as countries often use more than one district, multiple tiers (e.g. local, regional and national), open lists or an electoral threshold. This can mean that final seat allocations are frequently not proportional to the parties&#x27; vote share.

=== How the single transferable vote (STV) works ===
The single transferable vote is an older method than party-list PR, and it does not need to formally involve parties in the election process. Instead of parties putting forward ordered lists of candidates from which winners are drawn in some order, candidates run by name, each voter casts one vote by marking preferences for candidates, with only one marked preference used to place the vote. Votes cast for the candidates determine the winners. 

STV uses preferential ballots. The ranking is used to instruct election officials how the vote should be transferred in case the first preference is marked for an unelectable candidate or for an already elected candidate. Each voter casts one vote and the district used elects multiple members (more than one, usually 3 to 7). Because parties play no role in the vote count, STV may be used for nonpartisan elections, such as the city council of Cambridge, Massachusetts. A large proportion of the votes cast are used to actually elect someone so the result is mixed and balanced with no one voting block taking much more than its due share of the seats. Where party labels are indicated, proportionality party-wise is noticeable.

Counting votes under STV is more complicated than first-past-the-post voting, but the following example shows how the vote count is performed and how proportionality is achieved in a district with 3 seats. In reality, districts usually elect more members than that in order to achieve more proportional results. A risk is that if the number of seats is larger than, for example, 10 seats, the ballot will be so large as to be inconvenient and voters may find it difficult to rank the many candidates, although 21 are elected through STV in some elections with no great difficulty. (In many STV systems, voters are not required to mark more choices than desired. Even if all voters marked only one preference, the resulting representation would be more balanced than under single-winner FPTP.)

Under STV, the &quot;quota&quot;, an amount that guarantees election, is determined. In the example below, the Droop quota is used. Any candidate who earns more than 25 percent of the vote is declared elected. Note that it is only possible for 3 candidates to each achieve that quota.

In the first count, the first preference (favourite candidate) marked on each of the ballots is counted. Candidates whose vote tally equals or passes the quota are declared elected as shown in the example below. 
The table below shows the initial count, or first round or stage, of the vote count process.

Quota is 25 percent plus 1. (Droop quota).

Jane Doe and Fred Rubble are elected in the first round.

Next, surplus votes belonging to those already elected, votes the candidates received above the quota (votes that they did not need to be elected), are transferred to the next preference marked by the voters who voted for them. Continuing the example, suppose that all voters who marked first preference for Jane Doe marked John Citizen as their second choice. Based on this, Jane Doe&#x27;s surplus votes are transferred to John Citizen. John Citizen achieves the quota and so is declared elected to the third and last seat that had to be filled. 

Even if all of Fred Rubble&#x27;s surplus had gone to Joe Smith, the vote transfer plus Smith&#x27;s original votes would not add up to quota. 

Party B did not have two quotas of votes so was not due two seats, while Party A with 67 percent of the vote, was. It is possible, in realistic STV elections, for a candidate to win without quota if they are still in the running when the field of candidates has thinned to the number of remaining open seats.

In this example, the district result is balanced party-wise. No one party took all the seats, as frequently happens under FPTP or other non-proportional voting systems. The result is fairthe most popular party took two seats; the less popular party took just one. 

As well, the most popular candidates in each party won the party&#x27;s seats. 81 percent of the voters saw their first choice elected. At least 15 percent of them (the Doe first, Citizen second voters) saw both their first and second choices electedthey were likely more than 15 percent if some &quot;Citizen first&quot; votes gave their second preference to Doe. Every voter had satisfaction of seeing someone of the party they support elected in the district. 

Final-round vote tallies and party satisfaction break-down 

(quota is 25 percent plus 1) 
Under STV, to make up the 200-seat legislature as large as in the examples that follow, about 67 three-seat districts would be used. Districts with more seats would provide more proportional resultsone form of STV in Australia uses a district with 21 members being elected at once. With a larger district magnitude, it is more likely that more than two parties will have some of their candidates elected. 

With a lower district magnitude, it is more likely that only two parties will have their candidates elected. For example, in Malta, where STV is used with 5-member districts, it is common for successful candidates to receive 16.6 percent of the vote in the district. This produces a high effective threshold in the districts, and the country maintains a very strong two-party system. However, about 4000 voters in a district would be enough to elect a third-party candidate if voters desired but this seldom happens.

Conversely, New South Wales, which uses STV to elect its state legislative council in 21-seat contests, sees election of representatives of seven or eight different parties each time. In this election about 1/22nd of the vote in the state is enough to take a seat, and seven or eight parties take at least that many votes, demonstrating a different voting pattern than Malta exhibits.

=== How mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) works ===
Mixed-member proportional representation combines election of district members with election of additional members as compensatory top-up. Often MMP systems use single-member districts (SMDs) to elect district members. (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden use multi-member districts in their MMP systems.) MMP with SMDs is described here.

The mixed-member proportional system combines single member plurality voting (SMP), also known as first-past-the-post (FPTP), with party-list PR in a way that the overall result of the election is supposed to be proportional. The voter may vote for a district candidate as well as a party. The main idea behind MMP is &quot;compensation&quot;, meaning that the list-PR seat allocation is not independent of the results of the district level voting. First-past-the-post is a single winner system and cannot be proportional (winner-takes-all), so these disproportionalities are compensated by the party-list component.

A simple, yet common version of MMP has as many list-PR seats as there are single-member districts. In the example it can be seen, as is often the case in reality, that the results of the district elections are highly disproportional: large parties typically win more seats than they should proportionally, but there is also randomnessa party that receives more votes than another party might not win more seats than the other. Any such dis-proportionality produced by the district elections is addressed, where possible, by the allocation of the compensatory additional members.

MMP gives only as many compensatory seats to a party as they need to have the number of seats of each party be proportional. Another way to say this is that MMP focuses on making the outcome proportional.

==== Differences from mixed-member majoritarian system ====
Compare the MMP example to a mixed-member majoritarian system, where the party-list PR seat allocation is independent of the district results (this is also called parallel voting). Under a mixed-member majoritarian system, there is no compensation (no regard to how the district seats were filled) when allocating party-list seats so as to produce a proportional allocation of seats overall. The popular vote, the number of district seats won by each party, and the number of district and party-list PR seats are the same as in the MMP example above, yet the parties&#x27; seat tallies are different.

Parallel voting (using non-compensatory party seats)

The overall results are not proportional, although they are more balanced and fair than most single-winner first-past-the-post elections. Parallel voting is mostly semi-proportional. Mixed systems are the most proportional if the additional members are allocated in a compensatory way.

There are many versions of MMP in use. Some use only a single vote; in some, voters cast two votes, one for a local candidate and one for a party. Some allocate compensatory seats to best losers; others allocate according to party lists. Some use levelling seats to compensate for potential overhang seats; others don&#x27;t. Most impose an electoral threshold in order for a party to be eligible for any additional seats; some allow parties that elect one or more district seats to be eligible for additional seats even if its party share is below the threshold. Any barrier to access to the additional seats may produce wasted votes and dis-proportionality in the final result.

As well, there is single non-transferable vote, which is also semi-proportional. It has the advantage that parties play no direct role in elections and voters do not need to mark ranked votes. Each voter casts one vote for a candidate and as many candidates win by plurality as the number of seats in the district. Due to each voter casting just one vote, as in STV, and each district electing multiple members, as in STV, mixed representation is produced in each district and overall rough proportionality more or less. Without transferable votes, more votes are wasted than under STV.

== Proportional representation versus &quot;representation by population&quot; ==
The term &quot;proportional representation&quot; may be used to mean fair representation by population as applied to states, regions, etc. However, representation being proportional with respect solely to population size is not considered to make an electoral system &quot;proportional&quot; the way the term is usually used. 

For example, the US House of Representatives has 435 members, who each represent a roughly equal number of people; each state is allocated a number of members in accordance with its population size (aside from a minimum single seat that even the smallest state receives), thus producing equal representation by population. But members of the House are elected in single-member districts generally through first-past-the-post elections: a single-winner contest does not produce proportional representation as it has only one winner. 

Conversely, the representation achieved under PR electoral systems is typically proportional to a district&#x27;s population size (seats per set amount of population), votes cast (votes per winner), and party vote share (in party-based systems such as party-list PR). (Party-proportionality is also evident in many PR systems where party labels are used.) 

Both PR and &quot;rep. by pop.&quot; are preserved in European Parliament elections. EU gives each member state a number of seats roughly based on its population size (see degressive proportionality) and in each member state, the election must also be held using a PR system (with proportional results based on vote share). The members are elected through list PR (a system that allows voters to mark preferences for party lists) or STV. As well, country-wide electoral thresholds are restricted to five percent or lower, and to two to five percent in any district (or at-large district) where 35 or more are elected through list PR.

== Districting under proportional representation ==
All PR systems require multi-member election contests, meaning votes are pooled to elect multiple representatives at once. Pooling at the national level may be done in multi-member voting districts (in STV and most list-PR systems) or in single countrywidea so called &quot;at-large&quot;district (in only a few list-PR systems). A country-wide pooling of votes to elect more than a hundred members is used in Angola, for example. 

Where PR is desired at the municipal level, a city-wide at-large districting is sometimes used, to allow as large a district magnitude as possible. In other cases, multi-member wards are used.

For large districts, party-list PR is often used, but even when list PR is used, districts sometimes contain fewer than 20 members. 

STV, a candidate-based PR system, has only rarely been used to elect more than 21 in a single contest. 

Some PR systems use party lists and at-large pooling or regional pooling in conjunction with single-member districts (such as New Zealand&#x27;s MMP and Scotland&#x27;s additional member system). Other PR systems use party lists and at-large pooling in conjunction with multi-member districts (Scandinavian countries). In these systems, votes are pooled to allocate &quot;leveling seats&quot; (top-up) to compensate for the disproportional results produced in single-member districts using FPTP or to increase the fairness already produced in multi-member districts using list PR. PR systems that achieve the highest levels of proportionality tend to use as general pooling as possible (typically country-wide) or districts with large numbers of seats (high district magnitude). 

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The case for a single transferable vote system, a form of proportional representation, was made by John Stuart Mill in his 1861 essay &quot;Considerations on Representative Government&quot;. His remarks are relevant to any form of PR.
Mill&#x27;s essay does not support party-based proportional representation and may indicate a distaste for the ills of party-based systems in saying:Of all modes in which a national representation can possibly be constituted, this one affords the best security for the intellectual qualifications desirable in the representatives. At present, by universal admission, it is becoming more and more difficult for any one who has only talents and character to gain admission into the House of Commons. The only persons who can get elected are those who possess local influence, or make their way by lavish expenditure, or who, on the invitation of three or four tradesmen or attorneys, are sent down by one of the two great parties from their London clubs, as men whose votes the party can depend on under all circumstances.Many political theorists agree with Mill that in a representative democracy the representatives should represent all substantial segments of society but want reform rather than abolition of direct local community representation in the legislature. (Mill himself only served one term as MP and then found it impossible to get a party to nominate him as their candidate. He was pointed out as an example of the kind of publicly spirited person who cannot even achieve a nomination under first-past-the-post.)

STV and regionalized forms of additional-member systems or MMP systems (such as used to elect the Scottish Assembly) produce local area representation and overall PR through mixed, balanced representation at the district or regional level.

===Fairness===
PR tries to resolve the unfairness of single-winner and winner-take-all systems such as plurality voting, where the largest parties typically receive an &quot;unfair&quot; seat bonus and smaller parties are disadvantaged, always under-represented, and on occasion win no representation at all (Duverger&#x27;s law). Under FPTP, an established party in UK elections has been elected to majority government with as little as 33.7% of votes (in 2024,) and ten times on record since 1830, a government obtained the most seats while losing the popular vote to another party. In certain Canadian elections, majority governments have been formed by parties with the support of under 40 percent of votes cast (2011 Canadian election, 2015 Canadian election). If turnout levels in the electorate are less than 60 percent, such outcomes allow a party to form a majority government by convincing as few as one quarter of the electorate to vote for it. 

That same situation can occur elsewhere as well. In the 2005 UK election, for example, the Labour Party under Tony Blair won a comfortable parliamentary majority with the votes of only 21.6 percent of the total electorate. Such misrepresentation has been criticized as &quot;no longer a question of &#x27;fairness&#x27; but of elementary rights of citizens&quot;.

However, some PR systems with a high electoral threshold, or other features that reduce proportionality, are not necessarily much fairer: in the 2002 Turkish general election, using an open-list list PR system with a 10 percent threshold, 46 percent of votes were wasted. The other 54 percent of the votes did receive fair level of representation, though. 

Under first-past-the-post, a third or so of members are elected with less than half the votes cast in their district, the majority of voters in such districts not getting any local representation and with no levelling seats being used, getting no representation entirely.

District-based winner-take-all systems also benefit regional parties by allowing them to win many seats in the region where they have a strong following even though they have less support nationally, while other parties with support that is not concentrated in a few districts, like various Green parties, win few or no seats. An example was Canada&#x27;s 1993 election when the Bloc Québécois won 52 seats, all in Quebec, on 14 percent of the national vote , which was 12 more seats than it would have earned if seats were allocated based on the popular vote. The Progressive Conservatives collapsed to two seats on 16 percent of the votes spread nationally, when it was due 48. The Conservative party, although strong nationally, previously had won many of its seats in the West, In 1993, many of its Western supporters turned to the Reform party (a regional party), which won all its seats west of Ontario and most of its seats west of Saskatchewan. 

The Conservative vote was spread so thin that in only one riding did it take a majority of votes, and in only two ridings did it take enough votes to win the seat. In about 150 districts the Conservative candidate received more than 15 percent of the vote, but in only two cases did the candidate take enough votes to win the seat. Under PR, the Conservative party&#x27;s 16 percent of the votes would have been mirrored by elected repesentation (likely about 48 seats), while under FPTP the use of 295 separate election contests, with no overarching mechanism of proportionality, meant almost all of the Conservative votes were wasted. 

Similarly, in the 2015 UK General Election, conducted using single-winner FPTP, the Scottish National Party gained 56 seats, all in Scotland, with a 4.7 percent share of the national vote, while the UK Independence Party, with 12.6 percent, gained only a single seat.

===Representation of minor parties===
The use of multiple-member districts elects a greater variety of members compared to first past the post. It has been argued that in emerging democracies, inclusion of minorities in the legislature can be essential for social stability and to consolidate the democratic process.

Critics of PR, on the other hand, claim inclusion can give extreme parties a foothold in parliament. That is sometimes cited as a cause for the collapse of the Weimar government. With very low thresholds, very small parties can act as &quot;king-makers&quot;, holding larger parties to ransom during coalition discussions. The example of Israel is often quoted, These problems can be limited, as in the modern German Bundestag, by the use of a high electoral threshold, limiting the parties that receive parliamentary representation (This would in turn increase the number of wasted votes, if voters cannot register alternate preferences).

Another criticism is that the dominant parties in plurality/majoritarian systems, often looked on as &quot;coalitions&quot; or as &quot;broad churches&quot;, can fragment under PR as the election of candidates from smaller groups becomes possible. Israel, Brazil, and Italy (until 1993) are examples. However, research shows, in general, there is only a small increase in the number of parties in parliament (although small parties have larger representation) under PR.

Open list systems and STV, the only prominent PR system that does not require political parties, enable independent candidates to be elected. In Ireland, on average, about six independent candidates have been elected each parliament. This can lead to a situation where forming a Parliamentary majority requires support of one or more of these independent representatives. In some cases these independents have positions that are closely aligned with the governing party and it hardly matters. The Irish Government formed after the 2016 election even included independent representatives in the cabinet of a minority government. In other cases, the independent member&#x27;s electoral platform is entirely local and addressing this is a price for support.

===Coalitions===
The election of smaller parties gives rise to one of the principal objections to PR systems, that they almost always result in coalition governments.

Supporters of PR see coalitions as an advantage, forcing compromise between parties to form a coalition at the centre of the political spectrum, and often when an election forces government change, some of the old coalition are in the new coalition so PR produces continuity and stability. Opponents counter that with many policies, compromise is not possible. Neither can many policies be easily positioned on the left-right spectrum (for example, the environment). So policies are horse-traded during coalition formation, with the consequence that voters have no way of knowing which policies will be pursued by the government they elect; voters have less influence on governments. Also, coalitions do not necessarily form at the centre, and small parties can have excessive influence, supplying a coalition with a majority only on condition that a policy or policies favoured by few voters is/are adopted. Most importantly, some say the ability of voters to vote an unpopular party out of power is curtailed.

All these disadvantages, the PR opponents contend, are avoided by two-party plurality voting systems. Coalitions are rare; the two dominant parties necessarily compete at the centre for votes, so that governments are more reliably moderate; the strong opposition necessary for proper scrutiny of government is assured; and governments remain sensitive to public sentiment because they can be, and are, regularly voted out of power. However, this is not necessarily so; a two-party system can result in a &quot;drift to extremes&quot;, hollowing out the centre, or, at least, in one party drifting to an extreme. As well, a two-party election system may operate in an oligopolistic manner, with both parties ignoring a particular viewpoint (the two parties engaging in too much compromise), or one party may verge off, having been controlled by an extreme group, so creating polarization. A two-party plurality election system means there are many safe seats, districts where only one party has a chance to be elected. This often leads to polarization and low voter turnout, and sometimes opens door to foreign interference at the nomination stage. 

The opponents of PR also contend that coalition governments created under PR are less stable, and elections are more frequent. Italy is an often-cited example with many governments composed of many different coalition partners. However, Italy is unusual in that both its houses can make a government fall, whereas other countries, including many PR nations, have either just one house or have one of their two houses be the core body supporting a government. Italy&#x27;s current parallel voting system is not PR, so Italy is not an appropriate candidate for measuring the stability of PR. Canada, which uses FPTP with a multi-party system, had more elections between 1945 and 2017 than PR countries such as Norway, Germany and Ireland.

===Voter participation===
Plurality systems usually result in single-party-majority government because generally fewer parties are elected in large numbers under FPTP compared to PR, and FPTP compresses politics to little more than two-party contests. Relatively few votes in a few of the most finely balanced districts, the &quot;swing seats&quot;, are able to swing majority control in the house. Incumbents in less evenly divided districts are invulnerable to slight swings of political mood. In the UK, for example, about half the constituencies have always elected the same party since 1945; in the 2012 US House elections 45 districts (10% of all districts) were uncontested by one of the two dominant parties. Voters who know their preferred candidate will not win have little incentive to vote, and even if they do their votes have no effect, although they are still counted in the popular vote calculation.

With PR, there are no &quot;swing seats&quot;. Most votes contribute to the election of a candidate, so parties need to campaign in all districts, not just those where their support is strongest or where they perceive most advantage. This fact in turn encourages parties to be more responsive to voters, producing a more &quot;balanced&quot; ticket by nominating more women and minority candidates. On average about 8 percent more women are elected in PR systems than non-PR systems.

Since most votes count, there are fewer &quot;wasted votes&quot;, so voters, aware that their vote can make a difference, are more likely to make the effort to vote, and less likely to vote tactically. Compared to countries with plurality electoral systems, voter turnout improves and the population is more involved in the political process. However, some experts argue that transitioning from plurality to PR only increases voter turnout in geographical areas associated with safe seats under the plurality system; turnout may decrease in areas formerly associated with swing seats.

Proportional systems show higher political efficacy, citizens&#x27; trust in their ability to influence and understand the government, compared to plurality and majoritarian systems.

===Gerrymandering===
First-past-the-post elections are dependent on the drawing of boundaries of their single-member districts, a process vulnerable to political interference (gerrymandering) even if districts are drawn in such a way as to ensure approximately equal representation. However, because voter turnout varies from district to district and because in one district a winner might take 80 percent of the vote while in another the winner might be elected with only 30 percent of the vote, there might be wide variation in votes-per-winner, even if districts are drawn in such a way as to take in equivalent population. As one party might take its seats with a low votes-per-winner ratio while another party might not have that advantage, the result is likely to be disproportionate.

To compound the problem, boundaries have to be periodically re-drawn to accommodate population changes. Even apolitically drawn boundaries can unintentionally produce the effect of gerrymandering, reflecting naturally occurring concentrations.

PR systems, due to having larger districts with multiple members, are less prone to gerrymanderingresearch suggests five-seat districts or larger are immune to gerrymandering.

Equality of size of multiple-member districts is not important (the number of seats can vary) so districts can be aligned with historical territories of varying sizes such as cities, counties, states or provinces. Later population changes can be accommodated by simply adjusting the number of representatives in the district, without having to re-draw a single boundary. For example, Mollison in his 2010 plan for STV for the UK divided the country into 143 districts and then allocated varying number of seats to each district (to add up to the existing total of 650 MPs) depending on the number of voters in each but with wide ranges (his five-seat districts include one with 327,000 voters and another with 382,000 voters). His district boundaries follow historical county and local authority boundaries, yet he achieves more uniform representation than does the Boundary Commission, the body responsible for balancing the UK&#x27;s first-past-the-post constituency sizes.

Mixed-member systems are susceptible to gerrymandering for the local seats that remain a part of such systems. Under parallel voting, a semi-proportional system, there is no compensation for the effects that such gerrymandering might have. Under MMP, the use of compensatory list seats makes gerrymandering less of an issue. However, its effectiveness in this regard depends upon the features of the system, including the size of the regional districts, the relative share of list seats in the total, and opportunities for collusion that might exist. A striking example of how the compensatory mechanism can be undermined can be seen in the 2014 Hungarian parliamentary election, where the leading party, Fidesz, combined gerrymandering and decoy lists, which resulted in a two-thirds parliamentary majority from a 45% vote. This illustrates how certain implementations of mixed systems (if non-compensatory or insufficiently compensatory) can produce moderately proportional outcomes, similar to parallel voting.

===Link between constituent and representative===
It is generally accepted that a particular advantage of plurality electoral systems such as first-past-the-post, or majoritarian electoral systems such as the alternative vote, is the geographic link between representatives and their constituents. A notable disadvantage of PR is that, as its multiple-member districts are made larger, this link is weakened. In party list PR systems without delineated districts, such as the Netherlands and Israel, the there is no geographic link between representatives and their constituents. This makes it more difficult for local or regional issues to be addressed at the federal level. With relatively small multiple-member districts, in particular with STV, there are counter-arguments: about 90 percent of voters can consult a representative they voted for, someone whom they might think more sympathetic to their problem. In such cases it is sometimes argued that constituents and representatives have a closer link; constituents have a choice of representative so they can consult one with particular expertise in the topic at issue. With multiple-member districts, prominent candidates have more opportunity to be elected in their home constituencies, which they know and can represent authentically. There is less likely to be a strong incentive to parachute them into constituencies in which they are strangers and thus less than ideal representatives. Mixed-member PR systems incorporate single-member districts to preserve the link between constituents and representatives. However, because up to half the parliamentary seats are list rather than district seats, the districts are necessarily up to twice as large as with a plurality/majoritarian system where all representatives serve single-member districts.

An interesting case occurred in the Netherlands, when &quot;out of the blue&quot; a party for the elderly, the General Elderly Alliance gained six seats in the 1994 election. The other parties had not paid attention, but this made them aware. With the next election, the Party of the Elderly was gone, because the established parties had started to listen to the elderly. Today, a party for older citizens, 50PLUS, has established itself in the Netherlands, albeit never winning as many as six seats. 

This can be seen as an example how geographic representation is not all-important and does not overshadow all other particulars of the voting population. Voting in a single-member district restricts the voters to a specific geography where their votes either go to the winner in the district or are wasted. MMP allows a vote (in the form of the voter&#x27;s party vote) to be used outside the district if necessary to produce representation for the voter.

===Potential lack of balance in presidential systems===
In a presidential system, the president is chosen independently from the parliament. As a consequence, it is possible to have a divided government where a parliament and president have opposing views and may want to balance each other&#x27;s influence. However, the proportional system favors government of coalitions of many smaller parties that require compromising and negotiating topics. As a consequence, these coalitions might have difficulties presenting a united front to counter presidential influence, leading to a lack of balance between these two powers. With a proportionally elected House, a President may strong-arm certain political issues

This issue does not happen in a parliamentary system, where the prime-minister is elected indirectly by the parliament itself. As a consequence, a divided government is impossible. Even if the political views change with time and the prime minister loses their support from parliament, they can be replaced with a motion of no confidence. Effectively, both measures make it impossible to create a divided government.

==Attributes of PR systems==
===District magnitude===
Academics agree that the most important influence on proportionality is an electoral district&#x27;s magnitude, the number of representatives elected from the district. As magnitude increases, proportionality improves.

At one extreme, where the district encompasses the entire country (and with a low electoral threshold, highly proportionate representation of political parties can result), parties gain by broadening their appeal by nominating more minority and women candidates. Very few countries elect using an at-large districtonly the Netherlands, Israel, and a few others. Almost all PR systems use multi-member districts that divide the electorate while producing local representation. 

At the other extreme, the binomial electoral system used in Chile between 1989 and 2013, a nominally proportional open-list system, featured two-member districts. In some of those elections a party with more than a quarter of the vote in a district was ignored. As well, overall it gave just one seat to a party with 5 percent of the vote. It is generally not considered a genuinely proportional system.

Similar plans for very small districts that produce quasi- or semi-proportional representation have been proposed in the United States and United Kingdom. The FairVote plan for STV in the US House of Representatives proposes three- to five-member districts. Under such a system due to transferable votes, a party with around one-fourth of the vote in a district would win a seat there and in most districts no one party would take all the seats. 

Mollison&#x27;s plan for STV in the UK proposes four- and five-member districts mostly, with three- and six-seat districts used as necessary to fit existing boundaries, and even two-seat and single-member districts used where geography dictates.

After the introduction of STV in Ireland in 1921, district magnitudes slowly diminished as more and more three-member constituencies were defined, benefiting the dominant Fianna Fáil party, until 1979, when an independent boundary commission was established, reversing the trend. In 2010, a parliamentary constitutional committee recommended a minimum magnitude of four but that was no implemented. Currently every Dáil constituency elects three, four or five TDs.

===Electoral threshold===
The electoral threshold is the minimum vote required to win one seat. The lower the threshold, the higher the proportion of votes contributing to the election of representatives and the lower the proportion of votes wasted. An explicit threshold requires parties to win a certain percentage of the vote in order to be awarded seats from the party lists, and otherwise denies any representation to parties . By contrast, a natural threshold is (equal to a Droop quota) is the smallest number of votes needed to mathematically guarantee a seat.

In New Zealand, which uses mixed-member proportional representation, the electoral threshold is 5% of the national vote but parties that win at least one constituency seat get their due number of seats even if they do not achieve the threshold.

Turkey sets its electoral threshold at 7 percent, while the Netherlands sets its threshold at a single Hare quota, or 0.67 percent of national vote count. 

Israel has raised its threshold from 1 percent (before 1992) to 1.5 percent (1992-2004), to 2 percent (in 2006, and to 3.25 percent in 2014. Because that country uses at-large districting, the natural threshold would be less than 1 percent, much lower than the electoral threshold. 

South Africa has no explicit electoral threshold.

In STV elections, a candidate winning an electoral quota&#x27;s worth of votes (usually Droop quota) is assured election, and thus that candidate&#x27;s party would win one seat in the district.

===Party magnitude===
Party magnitude is the number of candidates elected from one party in one district. As district magnitude increases, it is likely more parties will elect larger delegations in the district and thus enjoy larger party magnitude.

As party magnitude increases, a party may decide to broaden its appeal by nominating women and members of minority groups. A balanced ticket will be more successful than a narrow slate. This encourages parties to nominate women and minority candidates.

But under STV, nominating too many candidates can be counter-productive, splitting the first-preference votes and allowing candidates to be eliminated before receiving transferred votes from elected or eliminated candidates of the same party and of other parties. An example of this was identified in a ward in the 2007 Scottish local elections where Labour, putting up three candidates, won only one seat while they might have won two if they had only run two and party support (as seen in first-preference votes) had been redistributed among just the two. 

The same effect may have contributed to the collapse of representation of Fianna Fáil in the 2011 Irish general election. The party received about half the votes compared to the previous election but received only one quarter of the seats it had received in that earlier election. In Dublin West, for example, it ran 13 candidates but elected just one.

But generally in STV contests, transfers of votes allow each party to take roughly its due share of the seats based on vote tallies of the party&#x27;s candidates. As well, where all the candidates of a party preferred by a voter are eliminated, the vote may find usefulness by being transferred to a candidate of a different party who is liked by the voter.

===Others===
Other aspects of PR can influence proportionality such as the size of the elected body, the choice of open or closed lists, ballot design, and vote counting methods.

==Measuring disproportionality==
Exact proportionality has a single unambiguous definition: the seat shares must exactly equal the vote shares, measured as seats-to-votes ratio. When this condition is violated, the allocation is disproportional, and it may be interesting to examine the degree of disproportionalitythe degree to which the number of seats won by each party differs from that of a perfectly proportional outcome. This degree does not have a single unambiguous definition. Some common disproportionality indexes are:

* The Gallagher Indexinvolves squaring the difference between each party&#x27;s vote share and seat share, and finding the square root of half of the sum of these amounts.
* Wasted vote, which counts votes cast for parties that did not obtain any seats (or votes not used to elect anyone at the district level, in systems where district-level electing is all that is used)
* The Sainte-Laguë Indexwhere the squared discrepancy from ideal seats-to-votes ratio is weighted equally for each voter.

Disproportionality changes from one election to another depending on voter behavior and size of electoral threshold or natural threshold. This is seen in the number of wasted votes in New Zealand. In 2005 New Zealand general election every party receiving more than 1 percent of the votes acquired seats due to every party at that level getting at least one seat in first-past-the-post voting. This election thus saw far fewer wasted votes compared to other elections when only the most popular parties took district seats. 

Different indexes measure different concepts of disproportionality. Some disproportionality concepts have been mapped to social welfare functions.

Disproportionality indexes are sometimes used to evaluate existing and proposed electoral systems. For example, the Canadian Parliament&#x27;s 2016 Special Committee on Electoral Reform recommended that if the existing election system was replaced, the new system should be designed to achieve &quot;a Gallagher score of 5 or less&quot;. This low level of disproportionality is consistently achieved in European PR but is much lower than was produced in the 2015 Canadian election under first-past-the-post voting, where the Gallagher index was 12.

==PR electoral systems==

=== Party-based systems ===

==== Party list PR ====
Party list proportional representation is an electoral system in which seats are first allocated to parties based on vote share, and then assigned to party-affiliated candidates on the parties&#x27; electoral lists. This system is used in many countries, including Finland (open list), Latvia (open list), Sweden (open list), Israel (national closed list), Brazil (open list), Kazakhstan (closed list), Nepal (closed list) as adopted in 2008 in first CA election, the Netherlands (open list), Russia (closed list), South Africa (closed list), Democratic Republic of the Congo (open list), and Ukraine (open list). For elections to the European Parliament, most member states use open lists; but most large EU countries use closed lists, so that the majority of EP seats are distributed by those. Local lists were used to elect the Italian Senate during the second half of the 20th century. Some common types of electoral lists are:

* Closed list systems, where each party lists its candidates according to the party&#x27;s candidate selection process. This sets the order of candidates on the list and thus, in effect, their probability of being elected. The first candidate on a list, for example, will get the first seat that party wins. Each voter casts a vote for a list of candidates. Voters, therefore, do not have the option to express their preferences at the ballot as to which of a party&#x27;s candidates are elected into office. A party is allocated seats in proportion to the number of votes it receives.
* Ley de Lemas, an intermediate system used in Uruguay, where each party presents several closed lists, each representing a faction. Seats are distributed between parties according to the number of votes, and then between the factions within each party.
* Open list systems, where voters may vote, depending on the model, for one person, or for two or more, or vote for a party list but indicate their order of preference within the list. These votes sometimes rearrange the order of names on the party&#x27;s list and thus which of its candidates are elected. Nevertheless, the number of candidates elected from each list is determined by the number of votes that the list receives or that the candidates on the list receive.
* Localized list systems, where parties divide their candidates in single member-like constituencies, which are ranked inside each general party list depending by their percentages. This method allows electors to judge every single candidate as in a FPTP system.
* Two-tier party list systems, as in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. These operate similarly to mixed-member proportional systems or additional member systems. For example, Denmark is divided into ten multiple-member voting districts arranged in three regions, electing 135 representatives. In addition, 40 compensatory seats are elected. Voters have one vote. It is cast for an individual candidate or for a party list on the district ballot. To determine district winners, parties are allocated district seats based on their district vote shares. Candidates in the district are apportioned their share of their party&#x27;s district list vote plus their individual votes, and the most-popular are elected to fill their party&#x27;s seats. Compensatory seats are apportioned to the regions according to the party votes aggregated nationally, and then to the districts where the compensatory representatives are determined. In the 2007 general election, the district magnitudes, including compensatory representatives, varied between 14 and 28. The basic design of the system has remained unchanged since its introduction in 1920.

==== Mixed systems ====
There are mixed electoral systems combining a plurality/majority formula with a proportional formula or using the proportional component to compensate for disproportionality caused by the plurality/majority component.

The most prominent mixed compensatory system is mixed-member proportional representation (MMP). It combines a single-district vote, usually first-past-the-post, with a compensatory regional or nationwide party list proportional vote. For example, suppose that a party wins 10 seats based on plurality, but requires 15 seats in total to obtain its proportional share of an elected body. A fully proportional mixed compensatory system would award this party 5 compensatory (PR) seats, raising the party&#x27;s seat count from 10 to 15. MMP has the potential to produce proportional or moderately proportional election outcomes, depending on a number of factors such as the ratio of FPTP seats to PR seats, the existence or nonexistence of extra compensatory seats to make up for overhang seats, and electoral thresholds. It was invented for the German Bundestag after the Second World War, and has spread to Lesotho, Bolivia, New Zealand and Thailand. The system is also used for the Scottish Parliament where it is called the additional member system.

Voters typically have two votes, one for their district representative and one for the party list. The list vote usually determines how many seats are allocated to each party in parliament. After the district winners have been determined, sufficient candidates from each party list are elected to &quot;top-up&quot; each party to the overall number of parliamentary seats due to it according to the party&#x27;s overall list vote. Before apportioning list seats, all list votes for parties which failed to reach the threshold are discarded. If eliminated parties lose seats in this manner, then the seat counts for parties that achieved the threshold improve. Any direct seats won by independent candidates are subtracted from the parliamentary total used to apportion list seats.

Proportionality of MMP can be compromised if the ratio of list to district seats is too low, as it may then not be possible to completely compensate district seat disproportionality. 

Another factor can be how overhang seats are handled, district seats that a party wins in excess of the number due to it under the list vote. To achieve proportionality, other parties require &quot;balance seats&quot;, increasing the size of parliament by twice the number of overhang seats, but this is not always done. Until recently, Germany increased the size of parliament by the number of overhang seats but did not use the increased size for apportioning list seats. This was changed for the 2013 national election after the constitutional court rejected the previous law, not compensating for overhang seats had resulted in a negative vote weight effect. Lesotho, Scotland and Wales do not increase the size of parliament at all, even if there are overhang seats. In 2012, a New Zealand parliamentary commission proposed abandoning compensation for overhang seats, and so fixing the size of parliament. At the same time, it proposed abolishing the single-seat threshold (the go-around past the electoral threshold used by some small parties to get their due share of seats). It was expected that such seats would be overhang seats. If that was done without abolishing overhang compensation, it would have increased the size of parliament further through the overhang compensation. The commission also proposed reducing the electoral threshold from 5 percent to 4 percent. It was expected that proportionality would not suffer from these changes.

Similarly to MMP, mixed single vote systems (MSV) use a proportional formula for allocating seats on the compensatory tier, but voters only have one vote that functions on both levels. MSV may use a positive vote transfer system, where unused votes are transferred from the lower tier to the upper, compensatory tier, where only these are used in the proportional formula. Alternatively, the MMP (seat linkage) algorithm can be used with a mixed single vote to &quot;top-up&quot; to a proportional result. With MSV, the similar requirements as in MMP apply to guarantee an overall proportional result.

Parallel voting (MMM) systems use proportional formulas to allocate seats on a proportional tier separately from other tiers. Certain systems, like scorporo use a proportional formula after combining results of a parallel list vote with transferred votes from lower tiers (using negative or positive vote transfer).

Another mixed system is dual-member proportional representation (DMP). It is a single-vote system that elects two representatives in every district. The first seat in each district is awarded to the candidate who wins a plurality of the votes, similar to FPTP voting. The remaining seats are awarded in a compensatory manner to achieve proportionality across a larger region. DMP employs a formula similar to the &quot;best near-winner&quot; variant of MMP used in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. In Baden-Württemberg, compensatory seats are awarded to candidates who receive high levels of support at the district level compared with other candidates of the same party. DMP differs in that at most one candidate per district is permitted to obtain a compensatory seat. If multiple candidates contesting the same district are slated to receive one of their parties&#x27; compensatory seats, the candidate with the highest vote share is elected and the others are eliminated. DMP is similar to STV in that all elected representatives, including those who receive compensatory seats, serve their local districts. Invented in 2013 in the Canadian province of Alberta, DMP received attention on Prince Edward Island where it appeared on a 2016 plebiscite as a potential replacement for FPTP, but was eliminated on the third round. It was also one of three proportional voting system options on a 2018 referendum in British Columbia.

==== Biproportional apportionment ====
Biproportional apportionment aims to achieve proportionality in two dimensions, for example: proportionality by region and proportionality by party. There are several mathematical methods to attain biproportionality.

One method is called iterative proportional fitting (IPF). It was proposed for elections by the mathematician Michel Balinski in 1989, and first used by the city of Zürich for its council elections in February 2006, in a modified form called &quot;new Zürich apportionment&quot; (&quot;Neue Zürcher Zuteilungsverfahren&quot;). Zürich had had to modify its party list PR system after the Swiss Federal Court ruled that its smallest wards, as a result of population changes over many years, unconstitutionally disadvantaged smaller political parties. With biproportional apportionment, the use of open party lists has not changed, but the way winning candidates are determined has. The proportion of seats due to each party is calculated according to their overall citywide vote, and then the district winners are adjusted to conform to these proportions. This means that some candidates, who would otherwise have been successful, can be denied seats in favor of initially unsuccessful candidates, in order to improve the relative proportions of their respective parties overall. This peculiarity is accepted by the Zürich electorate because the resulting city council is proportional and all votes, regardless of district magnitude, now have equal weight. The system has since been adopted by other Swiss cities and cantons.

Balinski has proposed another variant called fair majority voting (FMV) to replace single-winner plurality/majoritarian electoral systems, in particular the system used for the US House of Representatives. FMV introduces proportionality without changing the method of voting, the number of seats, or thepossibly gerrymandereddistrict boundaries. Seats would be apportioned to parties in a proportional manner at the state level. In a related proposal for the UK parliament, whose elections are contested by many more parties, the authors note that parameters can be tuned to adopt any degree of proportionality deemed acceptable to the electorate. In order to elect smaller parties, a number of constituencies would be awarded to candidates placed fourth or even fifth in the constituency unlikely to be acceptable to the electorate, the authors concede but this effect could be substantially reduced by incorporating a third, regional, apportionment tier, or by specifying minimum thresholds.

=== Candidate-based systems ===

==== Single transferable vote ====
The single transferable vote (STV), also called ranked choice voting, is a ranked system: voters rank candidates in order of preference. Voting districts usually elect three to seven representatives; each voter casts just one vote. The count is cyclic, electing or eliminating candidates and transferring votes until all seats are filled. A candidate whose tally reaches a quota, the minimum vote that guarantees election, is declared elected. The candidate&#x27;s surplus votes (those in excess of the quota) are transferred to other candidates at a fraction of their value proportionate to the surplus, according to the voters&#x27; preferences. If there are no surplus votes to transfer and there are still seats to fill, the least popular candidate is eliminated, those votes being transferred to their next preference at full value. The votes are transferred according to the next marked preference. Any votes that cannot be transferred are moved to a pile labelled exhausted or non-transferable.

The count continues until all the seats are filled or until there is only one more candidate than the number of remaining open seats. At that point all of them except the least popular candidate are declared elected, even if they do not have quota.

The transfer of votes of eliminated candidates is simplethe transfer of surplus votes is more involved. There are various methods for transferring surplus votes.

Manual methods used in early times and still today in places where STV was adopted in early 20th century (Ireland and Malta) transfer surplus votes according to a randomly selected sample, or transfer only a segment of the votes held by the successful candidate as surplus, selected based on the next usable marked preference.

Other more recent methods transfer all votes held by successful candidate at a fraction of their value (the fraction derived by the surplus divided by the candidate&#x27;s tally) and with reference to all the marked preferences on the ballots, not just the next usable preference. They may need the use of a computer.

The different methods may not produce the same result in all respects. But the front runners in the first count before any transfers are conducted are all or mostly elected in the end under any STV variant, so the various methods of transfers all produce much the same result.

Some variants of STV allow transfers to already elected or eliminated candidates, and these, too, can require a computer.

In effect, the method produces groups of voters of much the same size so the overall effect is to reflect the diversity of the electorate, each substantial group electing one or more representatives that the group had voted for.

In Cambridge, under STV, 90 percent of voters see their vote help to elect a candidate, more than 65 percent of voters see their first choice candidate elected, and more than 95 percent of voters see one of their top three choices win.

Other reports claim that 90 percent of voters have a representative to whom they gave their first preference. Voters can choose candidates using any criteria they wish, the proportionality is implicit. Another source states that, when STV was used between 1925 and 1955 in Cincinnati, 90 percent of voters saw their first choice elected or their vote used to elect a secondary preference, with about 60 to 74 percent of voters seeing their first choice elected, even if their vote was not used to elect that person because it was transferred on as a surplus vote.

Political parties are not necessary; all other prominent PR electoral systems presume that parties reflect voters wishes, which many believe gives power to parties. STV satisfies the electoral system criterion &quot;proportionality for solid coalitions&quot; a solid coalition for a set of candidates is the group of voters that rank all those candidates above all others and is therefore considered a system of proportional representation.

However, the small district magnitude used in STV elections (usually 5 to 9 seats, but sometimes rising to 21) has been criticized as impairing proportionality, especially when more parties compete than there are seats available, and STV has, for this reason, sometimes been labelled &quot;quasi proportional&quot;.

While this may be true when considering districts in isolation, results are usually more proportional.

Even though Ireland has particularly small magnitudes (3 to 5 seats), results of STV elections are &quot;highly proportional&quot;. In 1997, the average magnitude was 4. Eight parties gained representation, four of them with less than 3% of first-preference votes nationally. Six independent candidates also won election.

There have been claims made that STV handicaps certain extreme candidates because, to gain transfers based on back-up preferences and so improve their chance of election, candidates need to canvass voters beyond their own circle of supporters, and so need to moderate their views. This argument is made from the high natural threshold STV provides with low district magnitude.

Conversely, widely respected candidates can win election even if they receive relatively few first preferences. They do this by benefiting from strong subordinate preference support. Of course, they must have enough initial support so that they are not in the bottom rung of popularity or they will be eliminated when the field of candidate is thinned.

Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), the polymath logician and author, developed a passionate interest in voting methods. He believed RCV/STV to be fundamentally flawed, particularly regarding the allocation of “surplus” votes. His novel solution was to let the candidates themselves caucus and “club” votes together through the process of a negotiated consensus. As he stated:

May I, in conclusion, point out that the method advocated in my pamphlet
(where each elector names one candidate only, and the candidates themselves can, after the numbers are announced, club their votes, so as to bring in others besides those already announced as returned) would be at once perfectly simple and perfectly equitable in its result?

However, his entreaties to Lord Salisbury, leader of the Conservative Party and future prime minister, to adopt “clubbing” were rejected in 1884 as “too sweeping a change&quot;. Subsequently, he joined with Thomas Hare and several Conservative and Liberal members of Parliament to found the Proportional Representation Society (later the Electoral Reform Society) and to pursue STV.

==== Proportional approval voting ====
Systems can be devised that aim at proportional representation but are based on approval votes on individual candidates (not parties). Such is the idea of proportional approval voting (PAV). It satisifes an adaptation of PR called extended justified representation (EJR).

When there are many seats to be filled, as in a legislature, counting ballots under PAV may not be feasible, so sequential variants have been used, such as sequential proportional approval voting (SPAV). SPAV was used briefly in Sweden during the early 1900s. The vote counting procedure occurs in rounds. The first round of SPAV is identical to approval voting. All ballots are added with equal weight, and the candidate with the highest overall score is elected. In all subsequent rounds, ballots that support candidates who have already been elected are added with a reduced weight. Thus, voters who support none of the winners in the early rounds are increasingly likely to elect one of their preferred candidates in a later round. The procedure has been shown to yield proportional outcomes especially when voters are loyal to distinct groups of candidates (e.g. political parties).

Reweighted range voting (RRV) uses the same method as sequential proportional approval voting but uses a score ballot. Reweighted range voting was used for the nominations in the Visual Effects category for recent Academy Award Oscars from 2013 through 2017, and is used in the city of Berkeley, California, for sorting the priorities of the city council.

== History ==

=== Pre–19th century ===
One of the earliest proposals of proportionality in an assembly was by John Adams in his influential pamphlet &quot;Thoughts on Government&quot;, written in 1776 during the American Revolution:
Mirabeau, speaking to the Assembly of Provence on 30 January 1789, was also an early proponent of a proportionally representative assembly:

In February 1793, the Marquis de Condorcet led the drafting of the Girondist constitution which proposed a limited voting scheme with proportional aspects. Before that could be voted on, the Montagnards took over the National Convention and produced their own constitution. On 24 June, Saint-Just proposed the single non-transferable vote, which is semi-proportional, for national elections but the constitution was passed on the same day specifying first-past-the-post voting.

Already in 1787, James Wilson, like Adams a US Founding Father, understood the importance of multiple-member districts: &quot;Bad elections proceed from the smallness of the districts which give an opportunity to bad men to intrigue themselves into office&quot;, and again, in 1791, in his Lectures on Law: &quot;It may, I believe, be assumed as a general maxim, of no small importance in democratical governments, that the more extensive the district of election is, the choice will be the more wise and enlightened&quot;. The 1790 Constitution of Pennsylvania specified multiple-member districts for the state Senate and required their boundaries to follow county lines.

=== 19th century ===
A PR system that uses single transferable votes was invented in 1819 by an English schoolmaster, Thomas Wright Hill. He devised a &quot;plan of election&quot; for the committee of the Society for Literary and Scientific Improvement in Birmingham that used not only transfers of surplus votes from elected candidates but also transfers from candidates who did not have enough votes to be elected, a refinement that later Andræ and Hare initially omitted. But the procedure seemed unsuitable for a public election and was not publicised. In 1839, Hill&#x27;s son, colonial administrator Rowland Hill, recommended the concept for a city election in Adelaide, and a simple process was used in which voters were allowed to form groups that would each elect one representative. Each group being equally sized elected a representative with the same number of votes, ensuring election of a carpenter and a draper in addition to usual politician types.

The Sainte-Laguë method of party-list proportional representation was first described in 1832 by the American statesman and senator Daniel Webster.

The list plan system was conceived by Thomas Gilpin, a retired paper-mill owner, in a paper he read to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia in 1844: &quot;On the representation of minorities of electors to act with the majority in elected assemblies&quot;. It ensured at least one popularly elected member for each part of a multi-member district and also district-wide party-balanced representation. It was never put into practical use, but even as late as 1914 it was put forward as a way to elect the U.S. electoral college delegates and for local elections.

A practical election using the single transferable vote system (a combination of preferential voting and multi-member districts) was devised in Denmark by Carl Andræ, a mathematician, and first used there in 1855, making it the oldest PR system.

STV was also invented (apparently independently) in the UK in 1857 by Thomas Hare, a London barrister, in his pamphlet &quot;The Machinery of Representation&quot; and expanded on in his 1859 &quot;Treatise on the Election of Representatives&quot;. The scheme was enthusiastically taken up by John Stuart Mill, ensuring international interest. The 1865 edition of Hare&#x27;s book included the transfer of preferences from dropped candidates and the STV method was essentially complete, although Hare pictured the entire British Isles as one single district. Mill proposed it to the House of Commons in 1867, but the British parliament rejected it. The name of the system evolved from &quot;Mr. Hare&#x27;s scheme&quot; to &quot;proportional representation&quot;, then &quot;proportional representation with the single transferable vote&quot;, and finally, by the end of the 19th century, to &quot;the single transferable vote&quot;. Such a system was well suited to the British political tradition prevalent in the English-speaking world because under STV votes are cast directly for individuals. STV was later adopted for national elections in Malta (1921), the Republic of Ireland (1921) and Australia (1948).

In Australia, the political activist Catherine Helen Spence became an enthusiast of STV and an author on the subject. Through her influence and the efforts of the Tasmanian politician Andrew Inglis Clark, Tasmania became an early pioneer of the system, electing the world&#x27;s first legislators through STV in 1896, prior to its federation into Australia.

=== 20th century ===
In Russia, Leon Trotsky had proposed the election of a new Soviet presidium with other socialist parties on the basis of proportional representation in September 1917.

In the UK, the 1917 Speaker&#x27;s Conference recommended STV for all multi-seat Westminster constituencies, but it was only applied to university constituencies, lasting from 1918 until 1950 when the last of those constituencies were abolished.

In Ireland, STV was used in 1918 in the Dublin University constituency, and was introduced for devolved elections in 1921.

STV is currently used for two national lower houses of parliament, Ireland, since independence (as the Irish Free State) in 1922, and Malta, since 1921, long before independence in 1966. In Ireland, two attempts were made by Fianna Fáil governments to abolish STV and replace it with the first-past-the-post plurality system. Both attempts were rejected by voters in referendums held in 1959 and again in 1968. STV is also prescribed for all other elections in Ireland including that of the presidency, although it is there effectively the alternative vote, as it is an election with a single winner.

It is also used for the Northern Ireland Assembly and European and local authorities, Scottish local authorities, some New Zealand and Australian local authorities, the Tasmanian (since 1907) and Australian Capital Territory assemblies, where the method is known as &quot;Hare-Clark&quot;, and the city council in Cambridge, Massachusetts (since 1941).

The D&#x27;Hondt method was devised in 1878 by Belgian mathematician Victor D&#x27;Hondt as a way to allocate seats in a party-list PR system. Some Swiss cantons started using it to produce PR, beginning with Ticino in 1890. Victor Considerant, a utopian socialist, described a similar system in an 1892 book. Many European countries adopted similar systems during or after World War I. List PR was favoured on the Continent because the use of lists in elections, the scrutin de liste, was already widespread. Each uses one of a variety of methods of allocating seatsthe D&#x27;Hondt method, the Sainte-Laguë method or a different one.

Through the late 1800s and early 1900s, political reformers were involved in discussion and squabbles on the alternative system that would replace the first-past-the-post or block voting systems that were being used. Cumulative voting, limited voting, supplementary voting (contingent voting), STV, instant-runoff voting, the Bucklin system of ranked voting, and list PR were used in different places, at the municipal, state or national level in that period. List PR or STV eventually became the preferred alternative electoral method for many jurisdictions by the 1920s. The MMP version of list PR began to be used after the Second World War. District representation, proportionality of the results, the rate of wasted votes, the acceptable level of complication for voters and election officials, quickness of announcement of results and other aspects were often valued differently by the different reformers and by the elected governments who usually had the power to make decisions over electoral system. There is thus a wide range of PR systems used by the countries in the world that have adopted PR.

PR is used by a majority of the world&#x27;s 33 most robust democracies with populations of at least two million people23 use PR (20 use list PR, two use MMP and one uses STV), while only six use plurality or a majoritarian system (runoff or instant runoff) for elections to the legislative assembly; and four use parallel systems, which usually involves some members being elected through PR. PR dominates Europe, including Germany and most of northern and eastern Europe; it is also used for European Parliament elections. France adopted PR at the end of World War II, but discarded it in 1958; it was used for parliament elections in 1986. Switzerland has the most widespread use of proportional representation, as it is used there to elect not only national legislatures but also cantonal and communal legislatures.

PR is less common in the English-speaking world, especially at the national level. Malta and Ireland use STV for election of legislators. Australia uses it for senate elections. New Zealand adopted MMP in 1993. Gibraltar uses quasi-PR, limited voting. 

The UK, Canada and India use first-past-the-post systems for legislative elections, but even then its use is a fairly recent phenomenon, with single-member plurality used exclusively in the UK only since 1958, in Canada only since 1968, and in India only since 1950. STV was used to elect British university MPs prior to 1958. As well, a variety of election systems were used in Canada to elect provincial legislators. STV was used to elect some provincial legislators in Alberta from 1924 to 1955, and in Manitoba from 1920 to 1953. In both provinces, the alternative vote (AV) was used in rural areas alongside STV in the major urban centres. First-past-the-post was re-adopted in Alberta by the dominant party for reasons of political advantage. In Manitoba, a principal reason given was to address under-representation of Winnipeg in the provincial legislature (which could have otherwise been addressed by adding more members to urban districts).

STV has some history in the United States. Between 1915 and 1962, twenty-four cities used the system for at least one election. In many cities, minority parties and other groups used STV to break up single-party monopolies on elective office. One of the most famous cases is New York City, where a coalition of Republicans and others pursued the adoption of STV in 1936 as part of an effort to free the city from control by the Tammany Hall political machine. Under the new electoral system, Tammany Hall&#x27;s power was abated but NYC dropped STV in 1946 after only five elections. Another famous case is Cincinnati, Ohio, where, in 1924, Democrats and Progressive-wing Republicans secured the adoption of a council–manager charter with STV elections in order to dislodge the Republican machine of Rudolph K. Hynicka. Although Cincinnati&#x27;s council–manager system survives, Republicans and other disaffected groups replaced STV with plurality-at-large voting in 1957. From 1870 to 1980, Illinois used a semi-proportional cumulative voting system to elect its House of Representatives. Each district across the state elected both Republicans and Democrats year-after-year.

Cambridge, Massachusetts (STV) and Peoria, Illinois (cumulative voting) have used PR for many years. Illinois used cumulative voting for decades in its state elections.

San Francisco (in most elections before 1977 and between 1980 and 1999) had citywide elections in which people cast multiple votessometimes for as many as nine candidates but usually for five or sixsimultaneously (block voting), producing some aspects of PR through the use of a multi-member district. San Francisco used preferential voting (Bucklin voting) in its 1917 city election.

== List of countries using proportional representation ==
Eighty-five countries in the world use a proportional electoral system to fill a nationally elected legislative body.

The table below lists those countries and gives information on the specific PR system that is in use.

Detailed information on electoral systems applying to the first chamber of the legislature is maintained by the ACE Electoral Knowledge Network. Countries using PR as part of a mixed-member majoritarian (e.g. parallel voting) system are not included.

==Incentives for choosing an electoral system==
Changing the electoral system requires the agreement of a majority of the currently selected legislators, who were chosen using the incumbent electoral system. Therefore, an interesting question is what incentives make current legislators support a new electoral system, particularly a PR system.

Many political scientists argue that PR was adopted by parties on the right as a strategy to survive amid suffrage expansion, democratization and the rise of workers&#x27; parties. According to Stein Rokkan in a seminal 1970 study, parties on the right opted to adopt PR as a way to survive as competitive parties in situations when the parties on the right were not united enough to exist under majoritarian systems. This argument was formalized and supported by Carles Boix in a 1999 study. Amel Ahmed notes that prior to the adoption of PR, many electoral systems were based on majority or plurality rule, and that these systems risked eradicating parties on the right in areas where the working class was large in numbers. He therefore argues that parties on the right adopted PR as a way to ensure that they would survive as potent political forces amid suffrage expansion. A 2021 study linked the adoption of PR to incumbent fears of revolutionary threats.

In contrast, other scholars argue that the choice to adopt PR was also due to a demand by parties on the left to ensure a foothold in politics, as well as to encourage a consensual system that would help the left realize its preferred economic policies. The pressure to change may become so great that the government feels it must give in to the demand, even if it itself does not benefit from the change. This is the same process by which women&#x27;s suffrage was achieved in many countries.

<text>The Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA), officially known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA; ) and informally known as the Provos, was an Irish republican paramilitary force that sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland, facilitate Irish reunification and bring about an independent republic encompassing all of Ireland. It was the most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles. It argued that the all-island Irish Republic continued to exist, and it saw itself as that state&#x27;s army, the sole legitimate successor to the original IRA from the Irish War of Independence. It was designated a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and an unlawful organisation in the Republic of Ireland, both of whose authority it rejected.

The Provisional IRA emerged in December 1969, due to a split within the previous incarnation of the IRA and the broader Irish republican movement. It was initially the minority faction in the split compared to the Official IRA but became the dominant faction by 1972. The Troubles had begun shortly before when a largely Catholic, nonviolent civil rights campaign was met with violence from both Ulster loyalists and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), culminating in the August 1969 riots and deployment of British soldiers. The IRA initially focused on defence of Catholic areas, but it began an offensive campaign in 1970 that was aided by external sources, including Irish diaspora communities within the Anglosphere, and the Palestine Liberation Organization and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. It used guerrilla tactics against the British Army and RUC in both rural and urban areas, and carried out a bombing campaign in Northern Ireland and England against military, political and economic targets, and British military targets in mainland Europe. They also targeted civilian contractors to the British security forces. The IRA&#x27;s armed campaign, primarily in Northern Ireland but also in England and mainland Europe, killed over 1,700 people, including roughly 1,000 members of the British security forces and 500–644 civilians.

The Provisional IRA declared a final ceasefire in July 1997, after which its political wing Sinn Féin was admitted into multi-party peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland. These resulted in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, and in 2005 the IRA formally ended its armed campaign and decommissioned its weapons under the supervision of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. Several splinter groups have been formed as a result of splits within the IRA, including the Continuity IRA, which is still active in the dissident Irish republican campaign, and the Real IRA.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

The original IRA was formed in 1913 as the Irish Volunteers, at a time when all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom. The Volunteers took part in the Easter Rising against British rule in 1916, and the War of Independence that followed the Declaration of Independence by the revolutionary parliament Dáil Éireann in 1919, during which they came to be known as the IRA. Ireland was partitioned into Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and following the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922 Southern Ireland, renamed the Irish Free State, became a self-governing dominion while Northern Ireland chose to remain under home rule as part of the United Kingdom. The Treaty caused a split in the IRA, the pro-Treaty IRA were absorbed into the National Army, which defeated the anti-Treaty IRA in the Civil War. Subsequently, while denying the legitimacy of the Free State, the surviving elements of the anti-Treaty IRA focused on overthrowing the Northern Ireland state and the achievement of a united Ireland, carrying out a bombing campaign in England in 1939 and 1940, a campaign in Northern Ireland in the 1940s, and the Border campaign of 1956–1962. Following the failure of the Border campaign, internal debate took place regarding the future of the IRA. Chief-of-staff Cathal Goulding wanted the IRA to adopt a socialist agenda and become involved in politics, while traditional republicans such as Seán Mac Stíofáin wanted to increase recruitment and rebuild the IRA.

Following partition, Northern Ireland became a de facto one-party state governed by the Ulster Unionist Party in the Parliament of Northern Ireland, in which Catholics were viewed as second-class citizens. Protestants were given preference in jobs and housing, and local government constituencies were gerrymandered in places such as Derry. Policing was carried out by the armed Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the B-Specials, both of which were almost exclusively Protestant. In the mid-1960s tension between the Catholic and Protestant communities was increasing. In 1966 Ireland celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising, prompting fears of a renewed IRA campaign. Feeling under threat, Protestants formed the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), a paramilitary group which killed three people in May 1966, two of them Catholic men. In January 1967 the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) was formed by a diverse group of people, including IRA members and liberal unionists. Civil rights marches by NICRA and a similar organisation, People&#x27;s Democracy, protesting against discrimination were met by counter-protests and violent clashes with loyalists, including the Ulster Protestant Volunteers, a paramilitary group led by Ian Paisley.

Marches marking the Ulster Protestant celebration The Twelfth in July 1969 led to riots and violent clashes in Belfast, Derry and elsewhere. The following month a three-day riot began in the Catholic Bogside area of Derry, following a march by the Protestant Apprentice Boys of Derry. The Battle of the Bogside caused Catholics in Belfast to riot in solidarity with the Bogsiders and to try to prevent RUC reinforcements being sent to Derry, sparking retaliation by Protestant mobs. The subsequent arson attacks, damage to property and intimidation forced 1,505 Catholic families and 315 Protestant families to leave their homes in Belfast in the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969 The riots resulted in 275 buildings being destroyed or requiring major repairs, 83.5% of them occupied by Catholics. A number of people were killed on both sides, some by the police, and the British Army were deployed to Northern Ireland. The IRA had been poorly armed and failed to properly defend Catholic areas from Protestant attacks, which had been considered one of its roles since the 1920s. Veteran republicans were critical of Goulding and the IRA&#x27;s Dublin leadership which, for political reasons, had refused to prepare for aggressive action in advance of the violence. On 24 August a group including Joe Cahill, Seamus Twomey, Dáithí Ó Conaill, Billy McKee, and Jimmy Steele came together in Belfast and decided to remove the pro-Goulding Belfast leadership of Billy McMillen and Jim Sullivan and return to traditional militant republicanism. On 22 September Twomey, McKee, and Steele were among sixteen armed IRA men who confronted the Belfast leadership over the failure to adequately defend Catholic areas. A compromise was agreed where McMillen stayed in command, but he was not to have any communication with the IRA&#x27;s Dublin based leadership.

=== 1969 split ===
The IRA split into &quot;Provisional&quot; and &quot;Official&quot; factions in December 1969, after an IRA convention was held in Boyle, County Roscommon, Republic of Ireland. The two main issues at the convention were a resolution to enter into a &quot;National Liberation Front&quot; with radical left-wing groups, and a resolution to end abstentionism, which would allow participation in the British, Irish, and Northern Ireland parliaments. Traditional republicans refused to vote on the &quot;National Liberation Front&quot;, and it was passed by twenty-nine votes to seven. The traditionalists argued strongly against the ending of abstentionism, and the official minutes report the resolution passed by twenty-seven votes to twelve.

Following the convention the traditionalists canvassed support throughout Ireland, with IRA director of intelligence Mac Stíofáin meeting the disaffected members of the IRA in Belfast. Shortly after, the traditionalists held a convention which elected a &quot;Provisional&quot; Army Council, composed of Mac Stíofáin, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, Paddy Mulcahy, Sean Tracey, Leo Martin, Ó Conaill, and Cahill. The term provisional was chosen to mirror the 1916 Provisional Government of the Irish Republic, and also to designate it as temporary pending ratification by a further IRA convention. Nine out of thirteen IRA units in Belfast sided with the &quot;Provisional&quot; Army Council in December 1969, roughly 120 activists and 500 supporters. The Provisional IRA issued their first public statement on 28 December 1969, stating:

We declare our allegiance to the 32 county Irish republic, proclaimed at Easter 1916, established by the first Dáil Éireann in 1919, overthrown by force of arms in 1922 and suppressed to this day by the existing British-imposed six-county and twenty-six-county partition states... We call on the Irish people at home and in exile for increased support towards defending our people in the North and the eventual achievement of the full political, social, economic and cultural freedom of Ireland.

The Irish republican political party Sinn Féin split along the same lines on 11 January 1970 in Dublin, when a third of the delegates walked out of the party&#x27;s highest deliberative body, the ard fheis, in protest at the party leadership&#x27;s attempt to force through the ending of abstentionism, despite its failure to achieve a two-thirds majority vote of delegates required to change the policy. The delegates that walked out reconvened at another venue where Mac Stíofáin, Ó Brádaigh and Mulcahy from the &quot;Provisional&quot; Army Council were elected to the Caretaker Executive of &quot;Provisional&quot; Sinn Féin. Despite the declared support of that faction of Sinn Féin, the early Provisional IRA avoided political activity, instead relying on physical force republicanism. £100,000 was donated by the Fianna Fáil-led Irish government in 1969 to the Central Citizens Defence Committee in Catholic areas, some of which ended up in the hands of the IRA. This resulted in the 1970 Arms Crisis where criminal charges were pursued against two former government ministers and others including John Kelly, an IRA volunteer from Belfast. The Provisional IRA maintained the principles of the pre-1969 IRA, considering both British rule in Northern Ireland and the government of the Republic of Ireland to be illegitimate, and the Army Council to be the provisional government of the all-island Irish Republic. This belief was based on a series of perceived political inheritances which constructed a legal continuity from the Second Dáil of 1921–1922. The IRA recruited many young nationalists from Northern Ireland who had not been involved in the IRA before, but had been radicalised by the violence that broke out in 1969. These people became known as &quot;sixty niners&quot;, having joined after 1969. The IRA adopted the phoenix as the symbol of the Irish republican rebirth in 1969, one of its slogans was &quot;out of the ashes rose the Provisionals&quot;, representing the IRA&#x27;s resurrection from the ashes of burnt-out Catholic areas of Belfast.

=== Initial phase ===
In January 1970, the Army Council decided to adopt a three-stage strategy; defence of nationalist areas, followed by a combination of defence and retaliation, and finally launching a guerrilla campaign against the British Army. The Official IRA was opposed to such a campaign because they felt it would lead to sectarian conflict, which would defeat their strategy of uniting the workers from both sides of the sectarian divide. The Provisional IRA&#x27;s strategy was to use force to cause the collapse of the Northern Ireland government and to inflict such heavy casualties on the British Army that the British government would be forced by public opinion to withdraw from Ireland. Mac Stíofáin decided they would &quot;escalate, escalate and escalate&quot;, in what the British Army would later describe as a &quot;classic insurgency&quot;. In October 1970 the IRA began a bombing campaign against economic targets; by the end of the year there had been 153 explosions. The following year it was responsible for the vast majority of the 1,000 explosions that occurred in Northern Ireland. The strategic aim behind the bombings was to target businesses and commercial premises to deter investment and force the British government to pay compensation, increasing the financial cost of keeping Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. The IRA also believed that the bombing campaign would tie down British soldiers in static positions guarding potential targets, preventing their deployment in counter-insurgency operations. Loyalist paramilitaries, including the UVF, carried out campaigns aimed at thwarting the IRA&#x27;s aspirations and maintaining the political union with Britain. Loyalist paramilitaries tended to target Catholics with no connection to the republican movement, seeking to undermine support for the IRA.

As a result of escalating violence, internment without trial was introduced by the Northern Ireland government on 9 August 1971, with 342 suspects arrested in the first twenty-four hours. Despite loyalist violence also increasing, all of those arrested were republicans, including political activists not associated with the IRA and student civil rights leaders. The one-sided nature of internment united all Catholics in opposition to the government, and riots broke out in protest across Northern Ireland. Twenty-two people were killed in the next three days, including six civilians killed by the British Army as part of the Ballymurphy massacre on 9 August, and in Belfast 7,000 Catholics and 2,000 Protestants were forced from their homes by the rioting. The introduction of internment dramatically increased the level of violence. In the seven months prior to internment 34 people had been killed, 140 people were killed between the introduction of internment and the end of the year, including thirty soldiers and eleven RUC officers. Internment boosted IRA recruitment, and in Dublin the Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, abandoned a planned idea to introduce internment in the Republic of Ireland. IRA recruitment further increased after Bloody Sunday in Derry on 30 January 1972, when the British Army killed fourteen unarmed civilians during an anti-internment march. Due to the deteriorating security situation in Northern Ireland the British government suspended the Northern Ireland parliament and imposed direct rule in March 1972. The suspension of the Northern Ireland parliament was a key objective of the IRA, in order to directly involve the British government in Northern Ireland, as the IRA wanted the conflict to be seen as one between Ireland and Britain. In May 1972 the Official IRA called a ceasefire, leaving the Provisional IRA as the sole active republican paramilitary organisation. New recruits saw the Official IRA as existing for the purpose of defence in contrast to the Provisional IRA as existing for the purpose of attack, increased recruitment and defections from the Official IRA to the Provisional IRA led to the latter becoming the dominant organisation.
On 22 June the IRA announced that a ceasefire would begin at midnight on 26 June, in anticipation of talks with the British government. Two days later Ó Brádaigh and Ó Conaill held a press conference in Dublin to announce the Éire Nua (New Ireland) policy, which advocated an all-Ireland federal republic, with devolved governments and parliaments for each of the four historic provinces of Ireland. This was designed to deal with the fears of unionists over a united Ireland, an Ulster parliament with a narrow Protestant majority would provide them with protection for their interests. The British government held secret talks with the republican leadership on 7 July, with Mac Stíofáin, Ó Conaill, Ivor Bell, Twomey, Gerry Adams, and Martin McGuinness flying to England to meet a British delegation led by William Whitelaw. Mac Stíofáin made demands including British withdrawal, removal of the British Army from sensitive areas, and a release of republican prisoners and an amnesty for fugitives. The British refused and the talks broke up, and the IRA&#x27;s ceasefire ended on 9 July. In late 1972 and early 1973 the IRA&#x27;s leadership was being depleted by arrests on both sides of the Irish border, with Mac Stíofáin, Ó Brádaigh and McGuinness all imprisoned for IRA membership. Due to the crisis the IRA bombed London in March 1973, as the Army Council believed bombs in England would have a greater impact on British public opinion. This was followed by an intense period of IRA activity in England that left forty-five people dead by the end of 1974, including twenty-one civilians killed in the Birmingham pub bombings.

Following an IRA ceasefire over the Christmas period in 1974 and a further one in January 1975, on 8 February the IRA issued a statement suspending &quot;offensive military action&quot; from six o&#x27;clock the following day. A series of meetings took place between the IRA&#x27;s leadership and British government representatives throughout the year, with the IRA being led to believe this was the start of a process of British withdrawal. Occasional IRA violence occurred during the ceasefire, with bombs in Belfast, Derry, and South Armagh. The IRA was also involved in tit for tat sectarian killings of Protestant civilians, in retaliation for sectarian killings by loyalist paramilitaries. By July the Army Council was concerned at the progress of the talks, concluding there was no prospect of a lasting peace without a public declaration by the British government of their intent to withdraw from Ireland. In August there was a gradual return to the armed campaign, and the truce effectively ended on 22 September when the IRA set off 22 bombs across Northern Ireland. The leadership of Ó Brádaigh, Ó Conaill, and McKee were criticised by a younger generation of activists following the ceasefire, and their influence in the IRA slowly declined. The younger generation viewed the ceasefire as being disastrous for the IRA, causing the organisation irreparable damage and taking it close to being defeated. The Army Council was accused of falling into a trap that allowed the British breathing space and time to build up intelligence on the IRA, and McKee was criticised for allowing the IRA to become involved in sectarian killings, as well a feud with the Official IRA in October and November 1975 that left eleven people dead.

=== The &quot;Long War&quot; ===


Following the end of the ceasefire, the British government introduced a new three-part strategy to deal with the Troubles; the parts became known as Ulsterisation, normalisation, and criminalisation. Ulsterisation involved increasing the role of the locally recruited RUC and Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), a part-time element of the British Army, in order to try to contain the conflict inside Northern Ireland and reduce the number of British soldiers recruited from outside of Northern Ireland being killed. Normalisation involved the ending of internment without trial and Special Category Status, the latter had been introduced in 1972 following a hunger strike led by McKee. Criminalisation was designed to alter public perception of the Troubles, from an insurgency requiring a military solution to a criminal problem requiring a law enforcement solution. As result of the withdrawal of Special Category Status, in September 1976 IRA prisoner Kieran Nugent began the blanket protest in the Maze Prison, when hundreds of prisoners refused to wear prison uniforms.

In 1977 the IRA evolved a new strategy which they called the &quot;Long War&quot;, which would remain their strategy for the rest of the Troubles. This strategy accepted that their campaign would last many years before being successful, and included increased emphasis on political activity through Sinn Féin. A republican document of the early 1980s states &quot;Both Sinn Féin and the IRA play different but converging roles in the war of national liberation. The Irish Republican Army wages an armed campaign... Sinn Féin maintains the propaganda war and is the public and political voice of the movement&quot;. The 1977 edition of the &quot;Green Book&quot;, an induction and training manual used by the IRA, describes the strategy of the &quot;Long War&quot; in these terms:

# A war of attrition against enemy personnel [British Army] which is aimed at causing as many casualties and deaths as possible so as to create a demand from their [the British] people at home for their withdrawal.
# A bombing campaign aimed at making the enemy&#x27;s financial interests in our country unprofitable while at the same time curbing long-term investment in our country.
# To make the Six Counties... ungovernable except by colonial military rule.
# To sustain the war and gain support for its ends by National and International propaganda and publicity campaigns.
# By defending the war of liberation by punishing criminals, collaborators and informers.

The &quot;Long War&quot; saw the IRA&#x27;s tactics move away from the large bombing campaigns of the early 1970s, in favour of more attacks on members of the security forces. The IRA&#x27;s new multi-faceted strategy saw them begin to use armed propaganda, using the publicity gained from attacks such as the assassination of Lord Mountbatten and the Warrenpoint ambush to focus attention on the nationalist community&#x27;s rejection of British rule. The IRA aimed to keep Northern Ireland unstable, which would frustrate the British objective of installing a power sharing government as a solution to the Troubles.

The prison protest against criminalisation culminated in the 1981 Irish hunger strike, when seven IRA and three Irish National Liberation Army members starved themselves to death in pursuit of political status. The hunger strike leader Bobby Sands and Anti H-Block activist Owen Carron were successively elected to the British House of Commons, and two other protesting prisoners were elected to Dáil Éireann. The electoral successes led to the IRA&#x27;s armed campaign being pursued in parallel with increased electoral participation by Sinn Féin. This strategy was known as the &quot;Armalite and ballot box strategy&quot;, named after Danny Morrison&#x27;s speech at the 1981 Sinn Féin ard fheis:

Who here really believes that we can win the war through the ballot box? But will anyone here object if with a ballot paper in this hand and an Armalite in this hand we take power in Ireland?

Attacks on high-profile political and military targets remained a priority for the IRA. The Chelsea Barracks bombing in London in October 1981 killed two civilians and injured twenty-three soldiers; a week later the IRA struck again in London with an assassination attempt on Lieutenant General Steuart Pringle, the Commandant General Royal Marines. Attacks on military targets in England continued with the Hyde Park and Regent&#x27;s Park bombings in July 1982, which killed eleven soldiers and injured over fifty people including civilians. In October 1984 they carried out the Brighton hotel bombing, an assassination attempt on British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, whom they blamed for the deaths of the ten hunger strikers. The bombing killed five members of the Conservative Party attending a party conference including MP Anthony Berry, with Thatcher narrowly escaping death. A planned escalation of the England bombing campaign in 1985 was prevented when six IRA volunteers, including Martina Anderson and the Brighton bomber Patrick Magee, were arrested in Glasgow. Plans for a major escalation of the campaign in the late 1980s were cancelled after a ship carrying 150 tonnes of weapons donated by Libya was seized off the coast of France. The plans, modelled on the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War, relied on the element of surprise which was lost when the ship&#x27;s captain informed French authorities of four earlier shipments of weapons, which allowed the British Army to deploy appropriate countermeasures. In 1987 the IRA began attacking British military targets in mainland Europe, beginning with the Rheindahlen bombing, which was followed by approximately twenty other gun and bomb attacks aimed at British Armed Forces personnel and bases between 1988 and 1990.

=== Peace process ===
By the late 1980s the Troubles were at a military and political stalemate, with the IRA able to prevent the British government imposing a settlement but unable to force their objective of Irish reunification. Sinn Féin president Adams was in contact with Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume and a delegation representing the Irish government, in order to find political alternatives to the IRA&#x27;s campaign. As a result of the republican leadership appearing interested in peace, British policy shifted when Peter Brooke, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, began to engage with them hoping for a political settlement. Backchannel diplomacy between the IRA and British government began in October 1990, with Sinn Féin being given an advance copy of a planned speech by Brooke. The speech was given in London the following month, with Brooke stating that the British government would not give in to violence but offering significant political change if violence stopped, ending his statement by saying:

The British government has no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland: Our role is to help, enable and encourage ... Partition is an acknowledgement of reality, not an assertion of national self-interest.
The IRA responded to Brooke&#x27;s speech by declaring a three-day ceasefire over Christmas, the first in fifteen years. Afterwards the IRA intensified the bombing campaign in England, planting 36 bombs in 1991 and 57 in 1992, up from 15 in 1990. The Baltic Exchange bombing in April 1992 killed three people and caused an estimated £800 million worth of damage, £200 million more than the total damage caused by the Troubles in Northern Ireland up to that point. In December 1992 Patrick Mayhew, who had succeeded Brooke as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, gave a speech directed at the IRA in Coleraine, stating that while Irish reunification could be achieved by negotiation, the British government would not give in to violence. The secret talks between the British government and the IRA via intermediaries continued, with the British government arguing the IRA would be more likely to achieve its objective through politics than continued violence. The talks progressed slowly due to continued IRA violence, including the Warrington bombing in March 1993 which killed two children and the Bishopsgate bombing a month later which killed one person and caused an estimated £1 billion worth of damage. In December 1993 a press conference was held at London&#x27;s Downing Street by British prime minister John Major and the Irish Taoiseach Albert Reynolds. They delivered the Downing Street Declaration which conceded the right of Irish people to self-determination, but with separate referendums in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In January 1994 The Army Council voted to reject the declaration, while Sinn Féin asked the British government to clarify certain aspects of the declaration. The British government replied saying the declaration spoke for itself, and refused to meet with Sinn Féin unless the IRA called a ceasefire.

On 31 August 1994 the IRA announced a &quot;complete cessation of military operations&quot; on the understanding that Sinn Féin would be included in political talks for a settlement. A new strategy known as &quot;TUAS&quot; was revealed to the IRA&#x27;s rank-and-file following the ceasefire, described as either &quot;Tactical Use of Armed Struggle&quot; to the Irish republican movement or &quot;Totally Unarmed Strategy&quot; to the broader Irish nationalist movement. The strategy involved a coalition including Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Irish government acting in concert to apply leverage to the British government, with the IRA&#x27;s armed campaign starting and stopping as necessary, and an option to call off the ceasefire if negotiations failed. The British government refused to admit Sinn Féin to multi-party talks before the IRA decommissioned its weapons, and a standoff began as the IRA refused to disarm before a final peace settlement had been agreed. The IRA regarded themselves as being undefeated and decommissioning as an act of surrender, and stated decommissioning had never been mentioned prior to the ceasefire being declared. In March 1995 Mayhew set out three conditions for Sinn Féin being admitted to multi-party talks. Firstly the IRA had to be willing to agree to &quot;disarm progressively&quot;, secondly a scheme for decommissioning had to be agreed, and finally some weapons had to be decommissioned prior to the talks beginning as a confidence building measure. The IRA responded with public statements in September calling decommissioning an &quot;unreasonable demand&quot; and a &quot;stalling tactic&quot; by the British government.
On 9 February 1996 a statement from the Army Council was delivered to the Irish national broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann announcing the end of the ceasefire, and just over 90 minutes later the Docklands bombing killed two people and caused an estimated £100–150 million damage to some of London&#x27;s more expensive commercial property. Three weeks later the British and Irish governments issued a joint statement announcing multi-party talks would begin on 10 June, with Sinn Féin excluded unless the IRA called a new ceasefire. The IRA&#x27;s campaign continued with the Manchester bombing on 15 June, which injured over 200 people and caused an estimated £400 million of damage to the city centre. Attacks were mostly in England apart from the Osnabrück mortar attack on a British Army base in Germany. The IRA&#x27;s first attack in Northern Ireland since the end of the ceasefire was not until October 1996, when the Thiepval barracks bombing killed a British soldier. In February 1997 an IRA sniper team killed Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick, the last British soldier to be killed by the IRA.

Following the May 1997 UK general election Major was replaced as prime minister by Tony Blair of the Labour Party. The new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, had announced prior to the election she would be willing to include Sinn Féin in multi-party talks without prior decommissioning of weapons within two months of an IRA ceasefire. After the IRA declared a new ceasefire in July 1997, Sinn Féin was admitted into multi-party talks, which produced the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998. One aim of the agreement was that all paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland fully disarm by May 2000. The IRA began decommissioning in a process that was monitored by Canadian General John de Chastelain&#x27;s Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), with some weapons being decommissioned on 23 October 2001 and 8 April 2002. The October 2001 decommissioning was the first time an Irish republican paramilitary organisation had voluntarily disposed of its arms. In October 2002 the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended by the British government and direct rule returned, in order to prevent a unionist walkout. This was partly triggered by Stormontgate—allegations that republican spies were operating within the Parliament Buildings and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)—and the IRA temporarily broke off contact with de Chastelain. However, further decommissioning took place on 21 October 2003. In the aftermath of the December 2004 Northern Bank robbery, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Michael McDowell stated there could be no place in government in either Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland for a party that supported or threatened the use of violence, possessed explosives or firearms, and was involved in criminality. At the beginning of February 2005, the IRA declared that it was withdrawing a decommissioning offer from late 2004. This followed a demand from the Democratic Unionist Party, under Paisley, insisting on photographic evidence of decommissioning.

=== End of the armed campaign ===

On 28 July 2005, the IRA, with a statement read to the media by Séanna Walsh, declared an end to the armed campaign, affirming that it would work to achieve its aims solely through peaceful political means and ordering volunteers to end all paramilitary activity. The IRA also stated it would complete the process of disarmament as quickly as possible. The IRA invited two independent witnesses to view the secret disarmament work, Catholic priest Father Alec Reid and Protestant minister Reverend Harold Good. On 26 September 2005, the IICD announced that &quot;the totality of the IRA&#x27;s arsenal&quot; had been decommissioned. Jane&#x27;s Information Group estimated that the IRA weaponry decommissioned in September 2005 included:

* 1,000 rifles
* 2 tonnes of the plastic explosive Semtex
* 20–30 heavy machine guns
* 7 surface-to-air missiles
* 7 flamethrowers
* 1,200 detonators
* 11 rocket-propelled grenade launchers
* 90 handguns
* 100+ hand grenades

Having compared the weapons decommissioned with the British and Irish security forces&#x27; estimates of the IRA&#x27;s arsenal, and because of the IRA&#x27;s full involvement in the process of decommissioning the weapons, the IICD concluded that all IRA weaponry had been decommissioned. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain, said he accepted the conclusion of the IICD. Since then, there have been occasional claims in the media that the IRA had not decommissioned all of its weaponry. In response to such claims, the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) stated in its 10th report that the IRA had decommissioned all weaponry under its control. The report stated that if any weapons had been kept they would have been kept by individuals and against IRA orders.

In February 2015, Garda Commissioner Nóirín O&#x27;Sullivan stated that the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s police service, the Gardaí, have no evidence that the IRA&#x27;s military structure remains operational or that the IRA is engaged in criminal activity. In August 2015, George Hamilton, the PSNI chief constable, stated that the IRA no longer exists as a paramilitary organisation. He added that some of its structure remains, but that the group is committed to following a peaceful political path and is not engaged in criminal activity nor directing violence. He pointed out, however, that some of its members have engaged in criminal activity or violence for their own, individual ends. The statement was made in response to the killings of former Belfast IRA commanders Kevin McGuigan and Gerard Davison. McGuigan was shot dead in what was believed to be a revenge killing by former IRA members over the shooting death three months earlier of Davison. The Chief Constable stated there was no evidence that the killing of McGuigan was sanctioned by the IRA leadership. Also in response, the British government commissioned the Assessment on Paramilitary Groups in Northern Ireland. The assessment, concluded in October 2015, was that &quot;all the main paramilitary groups operating during the Troubles are still in existence, including the Ulster Volunteer Force, the Red Hand Commando, the Ulster Defence Association, the Provisional IRA, and Irish National Liberation Army.&quot; But, it added, &quot;the leaderships of the main paramilitary groups [including the IRA&#x27;s] are committed to peaceful means to achieve their political objectives.&quot;

== Weaponry and operations ==
In the early days of the Troubles the IRA was poorly armed: in Derry in early 1972 the IRA&#x27;s weaponry consisted of six M1 carbines, two Thompson submachine guns, one or two M1 Garand rifles, and a variety of handguns. As a result of black market arms deals and donations from sympathisers, the IRA obtained a large array of weapons such as surface-to-air missiles; M60 machine guns; ArmaLite AR-18, FN FAL, AKM and M16 rifles; DShK heavy machine guns; LPO-50 flamethrowers; and Barrett M90 sniper rifles. The IRA also used a variety of bombs during its armed campaign, such as car and truck bombs, time bombs, and booby traps, using explosives including ANFO and gelignite donated by IRA supporters in the Republic of Ireland and the plastic explosive Semtex donated by the Libyan government. The IRA&#x27;s engineering department also manufactured a series of improvised mortars in the Republic of Ireland, which by the 1990s were built to a standard comparable to military models. The IRA&#x27;s development of mortar tactics was a response to the heavy fortifications on RUC and British Army bases; as IRA mortars generally fired indirectly they were able to bypass some perimeter security measures. The mortars used a variety of different firing mechanisms including delay timers, this combined with the disposable nature of the weapons allowed IRA volunteers to reduce the risk of being arrested at the scene.

The IRA was mainly active in Northern Ireland, although it also attacked targets in England and mainland Europe, and limited activity also took place in the Republic of Ireland. The IRA&#x27;s offensive campaign mainly targeted the British Army (including the UDR) and the RUC, with British soldiers being the IRA&#x27;s preferred target. Other targets included British government officials, politicians, establishment and judicial figures, and senior British Army and police officers. The bombing campaign principally targeted political, economic and military targets, and was described by counter-terrorism expert Andy Oppenheimer as &quot;the biggest terrorist bombing campaign in history&quot;. Economic targets included shops, restaurants, hotels, railway stations and other public buildings. The IRA was blamed for the Abercorn Restaurant bombing in March 1972, when a bomb exploded without warning killing two women and injuring many people. Due to negative publicity after the Abercorn bombing, the IRA introduced a system of telephoned coded warnings to try to avoid civilian casualties while still causing the intended damage to properties and the economy. Civilian deaths were counter-productive to the IRA, as they provided the British with propaganda coups and affected recruitment and funding. Despite this IRA bombs continued to kill civilians, generally due to IRA mistakes and incompetence or errors in communication. These included the Donegall Street bombing which killed seven people including four civilians, and Bloody Friday, when nine people, five of them civilians, were killed when twenty-two bombs were planted in a one-mile radius of Belfast city centre. Premature explosions were another cause of civilian deaths, such as the Remembrance Day bombing which killed eleven people including ten civilians, and the Shankill Road bombing which killed ten people including eight civilians.

== Casualties ==
The IRA was responsible for more deaths than any other organisation during the Troubles. Two detailed studies of deaths in the Troubles, the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), and the book &quot;Lost Lives&quot;, differ slightly on the numbers killed by the IRA and the total number of conflict deaths. According to CAIN, the IRA was responsible for 1,705 deaths, about 48% of the total conflict deaths. Of these, 1,009 (about 59%) were members or former members of the British security forces, while 508 (about 29%) were civilians. According to &quot;Lost Lives&quot;, the IRA was responsible for 1,781 deaths, about 47% of the total conflict deaths. Of these, 944 (about 53%) were members of the British security forces, while 644 (about 36%) were civilians (including 61 former members of the security forces). The civilian figure also includes civilians employed by British security forces, politicians, members of the judiciary, and alleged criminals and informers. Most of the remainder were loyalist or republican paramilitary members, including over 100 IRA members accidentally killed by their own bombs or shot for being security force agents or informers. Overall, the IRA was responsible for 87–90% of the total British security force deaths, and 27–30% of the total civilian deaths.

During the IRA&#x27;s campaign in England it was responsible for at least 488 incidents causing 2,134 injuries and 115 deaths, including 56 civilians and 42 British soldiers. Between 275 and 300 IRA members were killed during the Troubles, with the IRA&#x27;s biggest loss of life in a single incident being the Loughgall ambush in 1987, when eight volunteers attempting to bomb a police station were killed by the British Army&#x27;s Special Air Service.

== Structure ==

All levels of the organisation were entitled to send delegates to General Army Conventions. The convention was the IRA&#x27;s supreme decision-making authority, and was supposed to meet every two years, or every four years following a change to the IRA&#x27;s constitution in 1986. Before 1969 conventions met regularly, but owing to the difficulty in organising such a large gathering of an illegal organisation in secret, while the IRA&#x27;s armed campaign was ongoing they were only held in September 1970, October 1986, and October or November 1996. After the 1997 ceasefire they were held more frequently, and are known to have been held in October 1997, May 1998, December 1998 or early 1999, and June 2002. The convention elected a 12-member Executive, which selected seven members, usually from within the Executive, to form the Army Council. Any vacancies on the Executive would then be filled by substitutes previously elected by the convention. For day-to-day purposes, authority was vested in the Army Council which, as well as directing policy and taking major tactical decisions, appointed a chief-of-staff from one of its number or, less often, from outside its ranks.

The chief-of-staff would be assisted by an adjutant general as well as a General Headquarters (GHQ) staff, which consisted of a quartermaster general, and directors of finance, engineering, training, intelligence, publicity, operations, and security. GHQ&#x27;s largest department, the quartermaster general&#x27;s, accounted for approximately 20% of the IRA&#x27;s personnel, and was responsible for acquiring weapons and smuggling them to Ireland where they would be hidden in arms dumps, and distributed them to IRA units as needed. The next most important department was engineering, which manufactured improvised explosive devices and improvised mortars. Below GHQ, the IRA was divided into a Northern Command and a Southern Command. Northern Command operated in Northern Ireland as well as the border counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, and Louth, while Southern Command operated in the remainder of Ireland. In 1977, parallel to the introduction of cell structures at the local level, command of the &quot;war-zone&quot; was given to the Northern Command, which facilitated coordinated attacks across Northern Ireland and rapid alterations in tactics. Southern Command consisted of the Dublin Brigade and a number of smaller units in rural areas. Its main responsibilities were support activities for Northern Command, such as importation and storage of arms, providing safe houses, raising funds through robberies, and organising training camps. Another department attached to GHQ but separate from all other IRA structures was the England department, responsible for the bombing campaign in England.

The IRA referred to its ordinary members as volunteers (or &quot;óglaigh&quot; in Irish), to reflect the IRA being an irregular army which people were not forced to join and could leave at any time. Until the late 1970s, IRA volunteers were organised in units based on conventional military structures. Volunteers living in one area formed a company as part of a battalion, which could be part of a brigade, such as the Belfast Brigade, Derry Brigade, South Armagh Brigade, and East Tyrone Brigade. In late 1973 the Belfast Brigade restructured, introducing clandestine cells named active service units, consisting of between four and ten members. Similar changes were made elsewhere in the IRA by 1977, moving away from the larger conventional military organisational principle owing to its security vulnerability. The old structures were used for support activities such as policing nationalist areas, intelligence-gathering, and hiding weapons, while the bulk of attacks were carried out by active service units, using weapons controlled by the brigade&#x27;s quartermaster. The exception to this reorganisation was the South Armagh Brigade, which retained its traditional hierarchy and battalion structure. Only a handful of volunteers from the South Armagh Brigade were convicted of serious offences, and it had fewer arrests than any other area, meaning that the security forces struggled to recruit informers.

== Political ideology ==

The IRA&#x27;s goal was an all-Ireland democratic socialist republic. Richard English, a professor at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, writes that while the IRA&#x27;s adherence to socialist goals has varied according to time and place, radical ideas, specifically socialist ones, were a key part of IRA thinking. Former IRA volunteer Tommy McKearney states that while the IRA&#x27;s goal was a socialist republic, there was no coherent analysis or understanding of socialism itself, other than an idea that the details would be worked out following an IRA victory. This was in contrast to the Official IRA and the Irish National Liberation Army, both of which adopted clearly defined Marxist positions. Similarly, the Northern Ireland left-wing politician Eamonn McCann has remarked that the Provisional IRA was considered a non-socialist IRA compared to the Official IRA.

During the 1980s, the IRA&#x27;s commitment to socialism became more solidified as IRA prisoners began to engage with works of political and Marxist theory by authors such as Frantz Fanon, Che Guevara, Antonio Gramsci, Ho-Chi Minh, and General Giap. Members felt that an Irish version of the Tet Offensive could possibly be the key to victory against the British, pending on the arrival of weapons secured from Libya. However, this never came to pass, and the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 brought a dogmatic commitment to socialism back into question, as possible socialist allies in Eastern Europe wilted away. In the years that followed, IRA prisoners began to look towards South African politics and the example being set by the African National Congress. Many of the imprisoned IRA members saw parallels between their own struggle and that of Nelson Mandela and were encouraged by Mandela&#x27;s use of compromise following his ascent to power in South Africa to consider compromise themselves.

The Provisionals considered their campaign to be a continuation of events such as the Irish revolutionary period of 1916-1923, with IRA leader Ruairí Ó Brádaigh describing their campaign as &quot;the current phase of the age-old Irish republican struggle&quot;.

== Categorisation ==

The IRA is a proscribed organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000, and an unlawful organisation in the Republic of Ireland under the Offences Against the State Acts, where IRA volunteers are tried in the non-jury Special Criminal Court. A similar system was introduced in Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973, with a Diplock court consisting of a single judge and no jury. The IRA rejected the authority of the courts in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and its standing orders did not allow volunteers on trial in a criminal court to enter a plea or recognise the authority of the court, doing so could lead to expulsion from the IRA. These orders were relaxed in 1976 due to sentences in the Republic of Ireland for IRA membership being increased from two years to seven years imprisonment. IRA prisoners in the UK and the Republic of Ireland were granted conditional early release as part of the Good Friday Agreement. IRA members were often refused travel visas to enter the United States, due to previous criminal convictions or because the Immigration and Nationality Act bars the entry of people who are members of an organisation which advocates the overthrow of a government by force.

American TV news broadcasts used the terms &quot;activists&quot;, &quot;guerrillas&quot;, and &quot;terrorists&quot; to describe IRA members, while British TV news broadcasts commonly used the term &quot;terrorists&quot;, particularly the BBC as part of its editorial guidelines published in 1989. Republicans reject the label of terrorism, instead describing the IRA&#x27;s activity as war, military activity, armed struggle or armed resistance. The IRA prefer the terms freedom fighter, soldier, activist, or volunteer for its members. The IRA has also been described as a &quot;private army&quot;. The IRA saw the Irish War of Independence as a guerrilla war which accomplished some of its aims, with some remaining &quot;unfinished business&quot;.

An internal British Army document written by General Sir Mike Jackson and two other senior officers was released in 2007 under the Freedom of Information Act. It examined the British Army&#x27;s 37 years of deployment in Northern Ireland, and described the IRA as &quot;a professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient force&quot;, while loyalist paramilitaries and other republican groups were described as &quot;little more than a collection of gangsters&quot;.

== Strength and support ==

=== Numerical strength ===

It is unclear how many people joined the IRA during the Troubles, as it did not keep detailed records of personnel. Journalists Eamonn Mallie and Patrick Bishop state roughly 8,000 people passed through the ranks of the IRA in the first 20 years of its existence, many of them leaving after arrest, retirement or disillusionment. McGuinness, who held a variety of leadership positions, estimated a total membership of 10,000 over the course of the Troubles. The British Army estimates the IRA had 500 volunteers in July 1971, 130 in Derry and 340 in Belfast, journalist Ed Moloney states by the end of the year the IRA in Belfast had over 1,200 volunteers. After the late 1970s restructure, the British Army estimated the IRA had 500 full-time volunteers. A 1978 British Army report by Brigadier James Glover stated that the restructured IRA did not require the same number of volunteers as the early 1970s, and that a small number of volunteers could &quot;maintain a disproportionate level of violence&quot;. Journalist Brendan O&#x27;Brien states by the late 1980s the IRA had roughly 300 active volunteers and 450 more in support roles, while historian Richard English states in 1988 the IRA was believed to have no more than thirty experienced gunmen and bombers, with a further twenty volunteers with less experience and 500 more in support roles. Moloney estimates in October 1996 the IRA had between 600 and 700 active volunteers.

=== Support from other countries and organisations ===

Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was a supplier of arms to the IRA, donating two shipments of arms in the early 1970s, and another five in the mid-1980s. The final shipment in 1987 was intercepted by French authorities, but the prior four shipments included 1,200 AKM assault rifles, 26 DShK heavy machine guns, 40 general-purpose machine guns, 33 RPG-7 rocket launchers, 10 SAM-7 surface-to-air missiles, 10 LPO-50 flamethrowers, and over two tonnes of plastic explosive Semtex. He also gave $12 million in cash to the IRA.

Irish Americans (both Irish immigrants and natives of Irish descent) also donated weapons and money. The financial backbone of IRA support in the United States was the Irish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID), founded by Irish immigrant and IRA veteran Michael Flannery. NORAID officially raised money for the families of IRA prisoners but was strongly accused by opponents of being a front for the IRA and being involved in IRA gunrunning. The key IRA transatlantic gunrunning network was run by Irish immigrant and IRA veteran George Harrison, who estimated to have smuggled 2,000–2,500 weapons and approximately 1 million rounds of ammunition to Ireland. However, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested Harrison for IRA arms smuggling in June 1981, thereby blocking the IRA&#x27;s arms supply from America. This forced the IRA to focus on importing weaponry from its already-established networks in Europe and the Middle East. In addition, Irish American support for the Republican cause began to weaken in the mid-1970s and gradually diminished in the 1980s due to bad publicity surrounding IRA atrocities and NORAID. By 1998, only $3.6 million were raised in America for the Irish Republican cause, in which many historians and scholars agreed such an amount was too small to make an actual difference in the conflict. 

Irish Canadians, Irish Australians, and Irish New Zealanders were also active in supporting the Republican cause. More than A$20,000 were sent per year to the Provisionals from supporters in Australia by the 1990s. Canadian supporters did not just fundraise and import weapons, but also smuggled IRA and Sinn Féin members into the United States, which, unlike Canada, enacted a visa ban on such members on the basis of advocating violence since the early 1970s. Gearóid Ó Faoleán wrote that &quot;[i]n 1972, inclement weather forced a light aeroplane to reroute to Shannon Airport from Farranfore in County Kerry, where IRA volunteers had been awaiting its arrival. The plane, piloted by a Canadian [IRA supporter], had flown from Libya with at least one cargo of arms that included RPG-7 rocket launchers&quot; where IRA smuggled these weapons into safe houses for its armed campaign. In 1974, seven Canadian residents (six who were originally from Belfast) were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for smuggling weapons to the IRA after &quot;raids in St. Catharines, Tavistock and Toronto and at the U.S. border at Windsor&quot;. Philip Kent, one of those arrested, was discovered in his car for having &quot;fifteen FN rifles and a .50 calibre machine gun&quot;.

Former MI5 agent Willie Carlin said that one of the main reasons why the IRA Army Council did not attack Scotland during the conflict was because doing so would reduce support from Scots and have a negative impact on its fundraising and other activities there. Carlin explained that &quot;[t]here were politicians in Scotland, a lot of whom were very sympathetic to the nationalist cause, and even the Sinn Fein cause&quot;. He also noted that while much of the money was donated by supporters in Glasgow, funds also came from all over the country, from &quot;farmers up there who had family and relatives in Ireland&quot;.

The IRA had links with the Basque separatist group ETA. Maria McGuire states the IRA received fifty revolvers from ETA in exchange for explosives training. In 1973 the IRA was accused by the Spanish police of providing explosives for the assassination of Spanish prime minister Luis Carrero Blanco in Madrid, and the following year an ETA spokesman told German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; they had &quot;very good relations&quot; with the IRA. In 1977 a representative of the Basque political party Euskal Iraultzarako Alderdia attended Sinn Féin&#x27;s 1977 ard fheis, and Ó Brádaigh had a close relationship with Basque separatists, regularly visiting the Basque region between 1977 and 1983. The IRA received support from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in the 1970s, with volunteers attending training camps in the Middle East. In 1977 a shipment of arms from the PLO was seized in Antwerp, Belgium. The shipment included twenty-nine AK-47 assault rifles, twenty-nine French submachine guns, seven RPG-7 rocket launchers and sixty rocket-propelled grenades, two Bren light machine guns, mortars, grenades and ammunition. PLO leader Yasser Arafat distanced himself from the IRA following the assassination of Lord Mountbatten in 1979.

In May 1996, the Federal Security Service, Russia&#x27;s internal security service, accused Estonia of arms smuggling, and claimed that the IRA had bought weapons from arms dealers linked to Estonia&#x27;s volunteer defence force, Kaitseliit. In 2001, three Irishmen, known as the Colombia Three, were arrested and accused of training Colombian guerrillas, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated the IRA was to be paid up to $35 million to train FARC in bomb-making techniques, including shaped charges, propane bombs, landmines and the construction of mortars. In 2005 a commander in the National Army of Colombia stated IRA techniques were being used all over Colombia by FARC, and British military experts confirmed bombs used by FARC had previously been used by the IRA. The Colombia Three were acquitted at trial in April 2004, before this was reversed at an appeal court in December 2004 although the men had fled the country and returned to Ireland before the appeal court verdict.

=== Financing ===

While overseas financial support was generally appreciated, the vast majority of the IRA revenue came from activities in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Since the Troubles began, the IRA was involved in criminal activities such as robberies, counterfeiting, protection rackets, kidnapping for ransom, fuel laundering and cigarette smuggling in order to fund its armed campaign. The IRA also raised funds by running legitimate businesses such as taxi firms, nightclubs, offices, and nursing homes. British law enforcement estimated that, by the 1990s, the IRA needed £10.5 million a year to operate. IRA supporters argue that as it was a clandestine organisation it was forced to use extra legal methods of fundraising, which were justified in order to achieve a political goal. However, this activity allowed the British government to portray the IRA as no more than a criminal gang. Armed robberies of banks, trains and small businesses across Ireland were a significant source of funding for the IRA, with over 1,000 raids on post offices in Northern Ireland. The PSNI, the IMC, and the British and Irish governments all accused the IRA of involvement in the biggest bank raid in British history—the 2004 Northern Bank robbery—when £26.5 million was stolen, which the IRA denied. In April 1987, RUC chief constable John Hermon told government ministers at the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference that &quot;[i]t costs the IRA £2-£3 million per year to maintain its activity. That amount is no problem to them and they have no shortage of money to purchase weapons.&quot;

The Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee in its 26 June 2002 report stated that &quot;the importance of overseas donations has been exaggerated and donations from the USA have formed only a small portion of IRA income.&quot; It identified extortion, fuel laundering, rum-running, tobacco smuggling, armed robbery, and counterfeiting in Ireland and Britain as the primary sources of funding for both Republican and Loyalist militants throughout and after the Troubles, while &quot;the sums involved [from overseas] [were and] are comparatively small&quot;. The committee estimated that the Provisional IRA made £5-8 million a year while spending £1.5m annually to carry out its campaign. One IRA interviewee stated that starting in the 1970s for example:

Belfast ran itself for years on its [social] clubs. You know the clubs? They formed the clubs, earlier on they formed it and ... the car parks, you know, not building them but taking over areas and running them as car parks. There was no one to say how much you took in and how much you took out and so, you know, if there was twenty-thousand coming in every week you could say there&#x27;s twelve-thousand coming in and then there&#x27;s eight-thousand going one way, and you paid your people and say there&#x27;s so much going every week. And that financed the movement.

Generally, the IRA was against drug dealing and prostitution, because it would be unpopular within Catholic communities and for moral reasons. The chief of the RUC Drugs Squad, Kevin Sheehy, said the IRA tried to prevent volunteers being directly involved with drugs, and noted one occasion when an IRA member caught with a small amount of cannabis was &quot;disowned and humiliated&quot; in his local area. The IRA targeted drug dealers with punishment shootings and ordered them to leave Ireland, and some were killed using the covername Direct Action Against Drugs. However, there are claims the IRA &quot;licensed&quot; certain dealers to operate and forced them to pay protection money. Following the murder of Robert McCartney in 2005, the IRA expelled three IRA volunteers. Adams said at Sinn Féin&#x27;s 2005 ard fheis &quot;There is no place in republicanism for anyone involved in criminality&quot;, while adding &quot;we refuse to criminalise those who break the law in pursuit of legitimate political objectives&quot;. This was echoed shortly after by an IRA statement issued at Easter, saying that criminality within the ranks would not be tolerated. In 2008, the IMC stated that the IRA was no longer involved in criminality, but that some members have engaged in criminality for their own ends, without the sanction or support of the IRA.

=== Popular support ===
Support for the IRA within nationalist communities and within the Republic of Ireland has fluctuated over the course of the conflict. In September 1979 the Economic and Social Research Institute conducted a wide-ranging survey of attitudes to the IRA in the Republic. Its findings showed that 20.7% broadly supported IRA activities, while 60.5% opposed them. Meanwhile, when respondents were asked whether they sympathised or rejected their motives, 44.8% of respondents expressed some level of sympathy with their motives while 33.5% broadly rejected them.
A study in 1999 showed amongst Catholics in Northern Ireland, 42% of respondents expressed sympathy with republican violence while 52% said they had no sympathy. The same study found 39.7% of respondents in the Republic of Ireland sympathised with republican violence.

According to a 2022 poll, 69% of Irish nationalists polled believe there was no option but &quot;violent resistance to British rule during the Troubles&quot;.

== Other activities ==
=== Sectarian attacks ===
The IRA publicly condemned sectarianism and sectarian attacks, however some IRA members did carry out sectarian attacks. Of those killed by the IRA, Malcolm Sutton classifies 130 (about 7%) of them as sectarian killings of Protestants, 88 of them committed between 1974 and 1976. Unlike loyalists, the IRA denied responsibility for sectarian attacks and the members involved used cover names, such as &quot;Republican Action Force&quot;, which was used to claim responsibility for the 1976 Kingsmill massacre where ten Protestant civilians were killed in a gun attack. They stated that their attacks on Protestants were retaliation for attacks on Catholics. Many in the IRA opposed these sectarian attacks, but others deemed them effective in preventing similar attacks on Catholics. Robert White, a professor at the Indiana University, states the IRA was generally not a sectarian organisation, and Rachel Kowalski from the Department of War Studies, King&#x27;s College London states that the IRA acted in a way that was mostly blind to religious diversity.

Protestants in the rural border areas of counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, where the number of members of the security forces killed was high, viewed the IRA&#x27;s campaign as ethnic cleansing. Henry Patterson, a professor at the University of Ulster, concludes that while the IRA&#x27;s campaign was unavoidably sectarian, it did not amount to ethnic cleansing. Although the IRA did not specifically target these people because of their religious affiliation, more Protestants joined the security forces so many people from that community believed the attacks were sectarian. McKearney argues that due to the British government&#x27;s Ulsterisation policy increasing the role of the locally recruited RUC and UDR, the IRA had no choice but to target them because of their local knowledge, but acknowledges that Protestants viewed this as a sectarian attack on their community.

=== Vigilantism ===

During the Troubles, the IRA took on the role of policing in some nationalist areas of Northern Ireland. Many nationalists did not trust the official police force—the RUC—and saw it as biased against their community. The RUC found it difficult to operate in certain nationalist neighbourhoods and only entered in armoured convoys due to the risk of attack, preventing community policing that could have occurred if officers patrolled on foot. In these neighbourhoods, many residents expected the IRA to act as a policing force, and such policing had propaganda value for the IRA. The IRA also sought to minimise contact between residents and the RUC, because residents might pass on information or be forced to become a police informer. The IRA set up arbitration panels that would adjudicate and investigate complaints from locals about criminal or &#x27;anti-social&#x27; activities. First time offenders may have been given a warning, or for more serious offences a curfew may have been imposed. Those responsible for more serious and repeat offences could have been given a punishment beating, or banished from the community. Kneecapping was also used by the IRA as a form of punishment. No punishment attacks have been officially attributed to the IRA since February 2006.

The vigilantism of the IRA and other paramilitary organisations has been condemned as &quot;summary justice&quot;. In January 1971, the IRA and British Army held secret talks aimed at stopping persistent rioting in Ballymurphy. It was agreed that the IRA would be responsible for policing there, but the agreement was short-lived. During the 1975 ceasefire incident centres were set up across Northern Ireland, staffed by Sinn Féin members who dealt with incidents that might endanger the truce. Residents went there to report crime as well as to make complaints about the security forces. The incident centres were seen by locals as &quot;IRA police stations&quot; and gave some legitimacy to the IRA as a policing force. Following the end of the ceasefire the incident centres remained open as Sinn Féin offices where crime continued to be reported, to be dealt with by the IRA.

=== Informers ===
Throughout the Troubles, some members of the IRA passed information to the security forces. In the 1980s, many IRA members were arrested after being implicated by former IRA members known as &quot;supergrasses&quot; such as Raymond Gilmour. There have been some high-profile allegations of senior IRA figures having been British informers. In May 2003, an American website named Freddie Scappaticci as being a British spy code-named Stakeknife. Scappaticci was said to be a high-level IRA informer working for the British Army&#x27;s Force Research Unit, while he was head of the IRA&#x27;s Internal Security Unit, which interrogated and killed suspected informers. Scappaticci denied being Stakeknife, and involvement in IRA activity. In December 2005, Sinn Féin member and former IRA volunteer Denis Donaldson appeared at a press conference in Dublin and confessed to being a British spy since the early 1980s. Donaldson, who ran Sinn Féin&#x27;s operations in New York during the Northern Ireland peace process, was expelled by the party. On 4 April 2006, Donaldson was shot dead by the Real IRA splinter group at his retreat near Glenties in County Donegal. Other prominent informers include Eamon Collins, Sean O&#x27;Callaghan, and Roy McShane, who worked as a driver for the leadership of Sinn Féin including Adams.

The IRA regarded informers as traitors, and a threat to the organisation and lives of its members. Suspected informers were dealt with by the IRA&#x27;s Internal Security Unit, which carried out an investigation and interrogated the suspects. Following this a court martial would take place, consisting of three members of equal or higher rank than the accused, plus a member of GHQ or the Army Council acting as an observer. Any death sentence would be ratified by the Army Council, who would be informed of the verdict by the observer. The original IRA, as well as all the major paramilitary organisations active during the Troubles, also killed alleged informers. The IRA usually killed informers with a single shot to the head, and left many of their bodies in public to deter other informers. There was also a group of sixteen people known as the Disappeared who were secretly buried between 1972 and 1985, which included alleged informers, agents for the security forces, and people that stole IRA weapons and used them in armed robberies. In March 1999 the IRA apologised for the &quot;prolonged anguish&quot; caused to the families of the Disappeared, and stated it had identified the burial places of nine people, including the most high-profile victim, Jean McConville, a Catholic civilian and widowed mother-of-ten. This led to the recovery of three bodies later in 1999, although Jean McConville&#x27;s body was not recovered until August 2003. As of 2019, the bodies of Columba McVeigh, Joe Lynskey, and undercover British Army intelligence officer Robert Nairac have yet to be recovered.

== Splinter groups ==
Former IRA volunteers are involved in various dissident republican splinter groups, which are active in the low-level dissident Irish republican campaign. The oldest dissident group is the Continuity IRA, which formed in 1986 following a split in the republican movement, over the decision to allow members, if elected, to take seats in Dáil Éireann. This group was inactive for several years while acquiring weapons and finance, their first attack was in 1994 during the Provisional IRA&#x27;s first ceasefire. The Real IRA was formed in November 1997 when senior Provisional IRA members, including quartermaster-general Michael McKevitt, resigned over acceptance of the Mitchell Principles. The Real IRA is best known for the 1998 Omagh bombing which killed 29 civilians, and the 2009 Massereene Barracks shooting which killed two British soldiers. In 2005/6 some Provisional IRA members defected and formed Óglaigh na hÉireann, which became active in 2009. This group also included former members of the Irish National Liberation Army and a faction that splintered from the Real IRA. In 2011 a group calling itself &quot;the IRA&quot; claimed responsibility for the murder of Ronan Kerr, a Catholic member of the PSNI. The group was believed to have formed in 2008, and included former senior Provisional IRA members unhappy at Sinn Féin&#x27;s direction and the peace process. Also in 2008, Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD) was formed in Derry. This vigilante group&#x27;s membership included former Provisional IRA members and members of other republican groups. RAAD, &quot;the IRA&quot;, and some smaller groups merged with the Real IRA in 2012 to form the New IRA.

<doc id="23300" wikidata="Q185465" url="?curid=23300" title="Paula Abdul">
<text>Paula Julie Abdul (born June 19, 1962) is an American singer, dancer, choreographer, actress, and television personality. She began her career as a cheerleader for the Los Angeles Lakers at the age of 18 and later became the head choreographer for the Laker Girls, where she was discovered by the Jacksons. After choreographing music videos for Janet Jackson, Abdul became a choreographer at the height of the music video era and soon thereafter she was signed to Virgin Records. Her debut studio album &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; (1988) became one of the most successful debut albums at that time, selling seven million copies in the United States and setting a record for the most number-one singles from a debut album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart: &quot;Straight Up&quot;, &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;, &quot;Cold Hearted&quot;, and &quot;Opposites Attract&quot;. Her second album &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1991) scored her two more chart-toppers – &quot;Rush Rush&quot; and &quot;The Promise of a New Day&quot;. With six number-one singles on Hot 100, Abdul tied Diana Ross for the third-most chart-toppers among female solo artists at the time. As of 2025, Abdul places seventh along with Diana Ross and Lady Gaga for the most number-one singles by female artists in the U.S. to date.

Abdul was one of the original judges on the television series &quot;American Idol&quot; from 2002 to 2009, and has since appeared as a judge on &quot;The X Factor&quot;, &quot;Live to Dance&quot;, &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;, and &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot;. She received choreography credits in numerous films, including &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; (1987), &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1987), &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988), &quot;Action Jackson&quot; (1988), &quot;The Doors&quot; (1991), &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996), and &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999). She received 17 MTV Video Music Award nominations, winning five, as well as receiving the Grammy Award for Best Music Video for &quot;Opposites Attract&quot; in 1991. She received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography twice for her work on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, and her own performance at the American Music Awards in 1990. Abdul was honored with her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and is the first entertainer to be honored with the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards&#x27; Hall of Fame Award.

==Early life==
Abdul was born in San Fernando, California. She is Jewish: her father, Harry Abdul, is of Syrian Jewish heritage and was born in Aleppo, Syria, raised in Brazil and emigrated to the United States. Her mother, Lorraine (Rykiss), was a concert pianist of Jewish heritage, from Minnedosa, Manitoba. Abdul has an older sister named Wendy. As an avid dancer, Abdul was inspired towards a show business career by Gene Kelly in the film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;.

Abdul began taking dance lessons at an early age in ballet, jazz, and tap. She attended Van Nuys High School, where she was a cheerleader and an honor student. At 15, she received a scholarship to a dance camp near Palm Springs, and in 1978, appeared in a low-budget independent musical film, &quot;Junior High School&quot;. In 1980, she graduated from Van Nuys High School. Abdul studied broadcasting at the California State University, Northridge. During her freshman year, she was selected from a pool of 700 candidates for the cheerleading squad of the Los Angeles Lakers NBA basketball team—the famed Laker Girls. Within a year, she became head choreographer. She remained with the Laker Girls until 1986.

==Career==
===1982–1986: Career beginnings===
Abdul was discovered by the Jacksons, after a few of the band members had watched her while attending a Los Angeles Lakers game. She was signed to do the choreography for the video to their single &quot;Torture&quot;. Abdul recalled feeling intimidated by having to tell the Jacksons how to dance, stating that she was &quot;not quite sure how [she] got through that.&quot; The success of the choreography in the video led to Abdul&#x27;s career as choreographer of music videos, notably Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot;, &quot;Nasty&quot;, &quot;When I Think of You&quot; and &quot;Control&quot; videos. It was also due to the success of the video that Abdul was chosen to be the choreographer for the Jacksons&#x27; &quot;Victory&quot; tour. Abdul also choreographed sequences for the giant keyboard scene involving Tom Hanks&#x27;s character in &quot;Big&quot; (1988).

===1987–1999: &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;, &quot;Spellbound&quot; and &quot;Head over Heels&quot;===

In 1987, Abdul used her savings to make a singing demo. Soon thereafter, she was signed to the newly formed Virgin Records America by Jeff Ayeroff, who had worked in marketing at A&amp;M Records with Janet Jackson. Although she was a skilled dancer and choreographer, Abdul was a relatively untrained singer, and worked with various coaches and record producers to develop her vocal ability. She has a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Ayeroff recalled signing Abdul to a recording contract years later, stating: &quot;She said, &#x27;I can sing, you know. I want to do an album.&#x27; Paula&#x27;s in our industry. Here&#x27;s someone with a personality and she&#x27;s gorgeous, and she can dance. If she can sing, she could be a star. So she went into the studio and cut a demo record and she could sing.&quot;

Abdul&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; (1988), would become the most successful debut album in history at that time, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart after 64 weeks (where it would spend 10 weeks at number one), and set a record for the most singles from a debut album to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the United States, with four: &quot;Straight Up&quot;, &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;, &quot;Cold Hearted&quot;, and &quot;Opposites Attract&quot;. The album was later certified 7× platinum by the RIAA. A remix album, &quot;Shut Up and Dance: Mixes&quot;, was also released and reached number seven in the United States, becoming one of the most successful remix albums to date. At the 32nd Grammy Awards, Abdul won her first Grammy for Best Music Video for &quot;Opposites Attract&quot;. She was also nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Straight Up&quot;, but lost to Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s &quot;Nick of Time&quot;. In 1991, singer Yvette Marine filed a lawsuit against Abdul and the Virgin label, alleging that it was her vocals that were used on several tracks from &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;, most notably &quot;Opposites Attract&quot;. A jury sided with Abdul and the label two years later in 1993, rejecting Marine&#x27;s claim to credit and copyright compensation.

Abdul saw continued success with her second studio album &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1991), which saw two additional number-one singles: &quot;Rush Rush&quot; and &quot;The Promise of a New Day&quot;. A third single &quot;Blowing Kisses in the Wind&quot; reached number six for three consecutive weeks. &quot;Spellbound&quot; retained the dance-pop sound from &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; and introduced elements of R&amp;B, and sold 7 million copies worldwide. The music video for &quot;Rush Rush&quot; featured a &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; motif, starring Keanu Reeves in the James Dean role. The album&#x27;s other singles, &quot;Vibeology&quot; and &quot;Will You Marry Me?&quot;, saw moderate success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching the top 20. In 1991, Abdul starred in a popular Diet Coke commercial in which she danced with a digital image of her idol, a young Gene Kelly. Abdul was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in December 1991. Abdul promoted &quot;Spellbound&quot; through the Under My Spell Tour, which was named by an MTV contest for fans. The tour was nearly cancelled due to an accident during rehearsals, but began on schedule in October 1991 and concluded in August 1992.

After her initial period of professional success, Abdul&#x27;s career entered a brief hiatus while she sought treatment for personal and physical issues. Her third studio album, &quot;Head over Heels&quot; (1995), retained both pop and R&amp;B elements and saw moderate commercial success, peaking at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the United States and later becoming her lowest-selling release. The lead single from &quot;Head over Heels&quot;, &quot;My Love Is for Real&quot;, featured a fusion of R&amp;B and traditional Middle Eastern instruments, and was performed with Yemeni-Israeli singer Ofra Haza. Its accompanying &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;-inspired music video was played in theaters across the world as a prologue to the film &quot;Clueless&quot;. The single performed well on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where it reached number one, and peaked at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Crazy Cool&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; served as the album&#x27;s second and third singles. To date, &quot;Head over Heels&quot; has sold over 500,000 copies in the United States. In 1995, Abdul released a dance workout video entitled &quot;Paula Abdul&#x27;s Get Up and Dance!&quot; (re-released on DVD in 2003), a fast-paced, hip-hop style workout. In 1997, Abdul co-wrote a song called &quot;Spinning Around&quot; with record producer and composer Kara DioGuardi, which was intended to be her comeback single from a new album, but the plan never materialized and the song was later given to Kylie Minogue. That year, Abdul appeared in the ABC television film &quot;Touched By Evil&quot;, playing a businesswoman who discovers that her boyfriend is a serial rapist. In 1998, she released a second workout video called &quot;Cardio Dance&quot; (re-released on DVD in 2000). Thereafter, Abdul served as the choreographer for several film and theater productions, including the 1998 musical &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; and the cheerleading scenes in &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999).

===2000–2009: &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Hey Paula&quot; and return to music===
In 2000, Virgin Records, with whom Abdul was already no longer affiliated, released the first of two compilation albums by Abdul, &quot;Paula Abdul: Greatest Hits&quot;. Abdul co-produced the 2001 pilot for &quot;Skirts&quot;, an MTV television series about a high school cheerleading squad; Abdul was also set to appear as the head coach. The pilot never aired. In 2002, she began appearing as one of three judges on the Fox reality competition series &quot;American Idol&quot;, where she won praise as a sympathetic and compassionate judge and mentor. She seemed especially kind compared to fellow judge Simon Cowell, who was often blunt in his appraisals of the contestants&#x27; performances. When she realized that Cowell&#x27;s over-the-top judging style was heartbreaking for many young contestants, Abdul was horrified and she considered leaving the series. Although their differences often resulted in heated on-air exchanges and confrontations, Cowell says he played a major role in convincing Abdul not to leave the series. While serving as a judge on &quot;American Idol&quot;, Abdul accepted a second assignment as reporter for &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. In December 2005, Abdul launched a cheerleading/fitness/dance DVD series called &quot;Cardio Cheer,&quot; which is marketed to children and teenage girls involved with cheerleading and dance. Abdul also choreographed The King&#x27;s touchdown celebration, as seen in a string of Burger King television commercials that aired during the 2005–06 NFL season. In 2006, Abdul appeared on the third series of &quot;The X Factor&quot; UK as a guest judge during the auditions, sitting alongside judges Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh.

A second compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits: Straight Up!&quot;, was released in 2007 by the Virgin label, who also made all of Abdul&#x27;s releases under their label available for digital download on iTunes. That year, Bravo began airing a reality television series centered around Abdul, &quot;Hey Paula,&quot; which followed her through her day-to-day life. Abdul&#x27;s behavior as depicted on the series was described as &quot;erratic&quot; by comedian Rosie O&#x27;Donnell and was criticized by audiences and critics, and &quot;Hey Paula&quot; was cancelled after a single season.

In 2007, Paula Abdul Jewelry launched its nationwide consumer debut on QVC, with the tagline &quot;fashion jewelry designed with heart and soul.&quot; Abdul&#x27;s first QVC appearance resulted in 15 sellouts of her first jewelry collection involving more than 34,000 pieces. In 2008, Abdul returned to music charts for the first time in nearly thirteen years with the single &quot;Dance Like There&#x27;s No Tomorrow&quot;, the first track on the album &quot;Randy Jackson&#x27;s Music Club Vol. 1&quot;. The song debuted on &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot;, and Abdul performed it during the pre-game show for Super Bowl XLII. &quot;Dance Like There&#x27;s No Tomorrow&quot; was a modest comeback hit for Abdul, peaking at number 62 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The moderate success led to reports of Abdul beginning work on a new album, but this never materialized. Abdul also made a brief guest appearance on an episode of the British television series &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot;, which aired in the United Kingdom in February 2008.

In January 2009, Abdul hosted &quot;RAH!,&quot; a cheerleading competition on MTV. &quot;RAH!&quot; featured five collegiate squads competing in a series of challenges with Abdul crowning one the winner. In May 2009, Abdul debuted her latest original song to date, &quot;I&#x27;m Just Here for the Music&quot; (originally an unreleased song from Kylie Minogue&#x27;s ninth album &quot;Body Language&quot;) on the Ryan Seacrest Radio KIIS-FM show and performed the single on the &quot;American Idol&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m Just Here for the Music&quot; reached number 87 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Abdul&#x27;s fifteenth song to appear on the chart.

In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in July 2009, Abdul&#x27;s manager David Sonenberg told the newspaper that, &quot;Very sadly, it does not appear that she&#x27;s going to be back on &quot;Idol&quot;.&quot; This came about as a result of stalled negotiations between Abdul and the series. In August, after numerous contract negotiations, Abdul confirmed that she would not return to &quot;Idol&quot; for its ninth season. &quot;The Times&quot; cited reports Abdul had been earning as much as $5 million per season and that she was reportedly seeking as much as $20 million to return. Abdul was replaced by Ellen DeGeneres. Abdul claimed her departure from &quot;Idol&quot; was not about money, but that she had to stand on principle.

===2010–2015: &quot;Live to Dance&quot;, &quot;The X Factor&quot; and &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;===
In January 2010, Abdul presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to choreographer Julie McDonald at the 11th Anniversary show of The Carnival: Choreographer&#x27;s Ball. In November, Abdul launched and co-founded AuditionBooth.com, a website that allows aspiring talents to connect with casting directors, producers, and managers.

In January 2011, Abdul began appearing on the short-lived CBS reality competition series &quot;Live to Dance&quot;, where she was also an executive producer. Abdul said that unlike &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Live to Dance&quot; is less about &quot;competition&quot; and more about &quot;celebration&quot;. After its first season of seven episodes, it was cancelled by CBS. In May 2011, it was announced that Abdul would rejoin Cowell on the first season of the American edition of &quot;The X Factor&quot;. In January 2012, Abdul announced that she would not return as a judge for the series&#x27; second season. Abdul was replaced by Britney Spears. In October 2012, Abdul served as a guest judge during week four of the &quot;All-Stars version&quot; of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. In April 2013, Abdul appeared on the Top 5 results show of season 12 of &quot;American Idol&quot; to compliment contestant Candice Glover on her performance of &quot;Straight Up&quot;.

On July 9, 2013, Abdul was a guest judge on &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; (season ten). In October 2013, Abdul was named as a judge on the revamped &quot;So You Think You Can Dance Australia&quot;, which aired on Australia&#x27;s Network Ten from February 9 through May 1, 2014. Abdul was present as a permanent member of the judge&#x27;s panel for all episodes of this season. She later became a permanent judge of the American version starting with its twelfth season. In January 2017, Abdul announced that she would not be returning as a judge for its fourteenth season because of her tour schedule.

In April 2014, Abdul was a guest judge on &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; (episode &quot;Queens of Talk&quot;), which reunited her with previous &quot;Idol&quot; contestant Adore Delano. In June 2014, Abdul made a cameo appearance on the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; and shared scenes with established character Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher). In 2015, Abdul made a guest appearance on the comedy sitcom &quot;Real Husbands of Hollywood&quot; on its season 4 premiere. She was shown in a comedic scene with Arsenio Hall where she was trying to kick Hall out of her pool house. On November 16, 2015, Abdul along with Charles &quot;Chucky&quot; Klapow, Renee Richie, and Nakul Dev Mahajan won the World Choreography Award for Outstanding Choreography Digital Format for the video &#x27;Check Yourself&#x27;. On November 22, 2015, Abdul and Donnie Wahlberg presented Favorite Female Artist – Pop/Rock at the 43rd American Music Awards; the award Abdul won at the 1990 AMAs, presented to her by Wahlberg.

===2016–present: Return to performing, Las Vegas residency===
On August 6, 2016, Abdul performed a full headline set for the first time in 26 years at the Mixtape Festival in Hershey, Pennsylvania. In November 2016, New Kids on the Block announced that Abdul would be touring with them and Boyz II Men on their Total Package Tour in 2017; her first tour in 25 years. The tour began on May 12 in Columbus, Ohio, and concluded on July 16, 2017, in Hollywood, Florida, for a total of 47 shows. In an interview with &quot;Elle&quot; magazine, Abdul stated there were &quot;many reasons&quot; she decided to return to the stage after over two decades, saying: &quot;I took a long break and had sustained some injuries in the past. Then I returned to television with &quot;American Idol&quot; and that took up a good decade of my life. Then I went out to do some more television, as well. I always wanted to get back on stage, because I missed it. I wanted to get back in close contact with the people who have supported me all throughout my career and be able to see them again. Plus, I was getting asked all the time if I would ever do it again! I finally said, You know what, I want to and I&#x27;m going to make it a priority. I&#x27;m really passionate about it and it&#x27;s fun, and I want to connect with my fans around the country.&quot;

In July 2018, Abdul announced that she would embark on a solo headlining tour across North America that fall, entitled Straight Up Paula!, as part of the celebration of the 30th anniversary of her debut studio album &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;. The tour began in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on October 18 and concluded in Los Angeles, California, on June 7, 2019, for a total of 25 shows.

Abdul performed a medley of her greatest hits at the 2019 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, closing out the show. On May 1, 2019, Abdul announced her first Las Vegas residency, Paula Abdul: Forever Your Girl. The residency&#x27;s first leg began on August 13, the first of 20 dates, ending in January 2020. On June 7, 2019, Abdul opened LA Pride.

Abdul also performed at the fourteenth series finale of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; with Light Balance Kids, Brian King Joseph, and Tyler Butler-Figueroa to surprise Cowell. In October 2020, it was announced that Abdul would serve as a panelist for Fox&#x27;s reality competition, &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot;. In April 2021, ABC announced that Abdul would return to &quot;American Idol&quot; as a guest-judge while Luke Bryan was out sick after being diagnosed with COVID-19. She returned as a guest judge on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; for Music Video Night in its 32nd season. In 2023, Abdul joined the producing team of the Broadway musical &quot;How to Dance in Ohio&quot;. She also appeared as a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&quot;. In 2024, Abdul co-headlines The Magic Summer Tour. Her Straight Up! to Canada Tour that was scheduled to commence in September 2024 has since been cancelled.

==Personal life==

=== Relationships ===
Abdul married actor Emilio Estevez in 1992, and filed for divorce in 1994. In 1995, Abdul stated that the reason for their divorce was that she wanted children and Estevez, who had two children from a previous relationship, did not. Abdul married clothing designer Brad Beckerman in 1996, at the New England Carousel Museum in Bristol, Connecticut. They filed for divorce in 1998, after 17 months of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences.

=== Beliefs ===
Abdul is observant in her Jewish faith, and is proud of her heritage. She once stated, &quot;My father is a Syrian Jew whose family immigrated to Brazil. My mother is Canadian with Jewish roots. My dream is to go to Israel for a real holiday.&quot; In November 2006, when Israeli Tourism Minister Isaac Herzog invited her to Israel, Abdul responded with a hug, adding, &quot;I will come; you have helped me make a dream come true.&quot; In 2013, at the age of 51, Abdul had her bat mitzvah in Safed, Israel, at the International Center for Tzfat Kabbalah, a museum and spiritual retreat for the study of Kabbalah – Jewish mysticism. In 2003, Abdul was reported as a practitioner of Transcendental Meditation.

Abdul is a dog lover who raised awareness about National Guide Dog Month in May 2009, and she teamed up with Dick Van Patten to help people with blindness to have more independence through the help of guide dogs. She does not wear real fur.

=== Health ===
Abdul has said that she was injured in a plane crash in 1992 during her Under My Spell Tour, necessitating 15 cervical spinal surgeries. When, in 2020, some gossip sites, including &quot;Jezebel&quot;, questioned the veracity of this, Abdul responded during an interview with Yahoo Entertainment, stating &quot;You know what? It&#x27;s like, there are seven other people that were on the plane, who were in that plane accident with me. So, I really don&#x27;t care what people have to say. I don&#x27;t.&quot; Abdul has insisted in interviews that the reason the crash has no official NTSB record or was documented in the media at the time is because the occupants on the plane signed non-disclosure agreements.

In 1994, Abdul sought treatment for bulimia nervosa, which she revealed years later had first developed during her teens and only intensified after she became a pop star. She said: &quot;I learned at a very early age I didn&#x27;t fit in physically. I learned through years of rejections from auditions. I would ask myself, &#x27;Why can&#x27;t I be tall and skinny like the other dancers?&#x27; I felt nervous and out of control, and all I could think about was food. Food numbed the fear and anxiety. I&#x27;d eat and then run to the bathroom.&quot;

In 2005, Abdul said she had been diagnosed in November 2004 with a neurological disorder causing chronic pain, reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), following a &quot;cheerleading accident&quot; at age 17. She discussed the diagnosis in response to allegations of drug use.

In April 2006, Abdul filed a report at a Hollywood police station stating she had been a victim of battery at a private party at about 1 am on April 2, according to LAPD spokesman Lt. Paul Vernon. &quot;According to Abdul, the man at the party argued with her, grabbed her by the arm and threw her against a wall,&quot; Vernon said. &quot;She said she had sustained a concussion and spinal injuries.&quot;

==== Allegations of drug use ====
Substance abuse allegations arose as the result of what some described as &quot;erratic behavior&quot; by Abdul during episodes of &quot;American Idol&quot;. After reading these allegations on message boards, Abdul told &quot;People&quot; in April 2005 about her RSD diagnosis; she added that she was pain-free following treatment with anti-inflammatory medication. Allegations arose again in January 2007 when videos circulated on the Internet of Abdul appearing to sway in her chair and slur her speech during a set of interviews. Abdul&#x27;s publicist attributed this to fatigue and technical difficulties during the recording of the interviews. It was revealed on the Bravo show &quot;Hey Paula&quot;, which had followed Abdul with a video camera prior to the interviews, that Abdul had not been sleeping, perhaps suffering from some mild form of insomnia. In February 2007, Abdul told &quot;Us Weekly&quot; that she had never been drunk or used illegal drugs, and called the allegations &quot;lies&quot;.

In May 2009, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; posted an article on its website that said that Abdul told them she stayed at the La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California, for three days the previous year to recover from physical dependence on prescription pain medications. The medications, prescribed due to injuries and her RSD diagnosis, included a pain patch, nerve medication, and a muscle relaxant. According to the article, Abdul said the medications made her &quot;get weird&quot; at times and that she suffered from physical withdrawal symptoms during her recovery. Later that same week, in an interview with Detroit radio station WKQI, Abdul rejected the article&#x27;s accuracy. She told the radio station she never checked into a rehab clinic and never had a drug abuse problem.

=== 2004 car crash ===
In December 2004, Abdul was driving her Mercedes-Benz on a Los Angeles-area freeway when she changed lanes and hit another vehicle, but did not stop or render assistance. The driver and passenger took a photograph with a cell phone camera and wrote down the license plate number of the car, which was traced to Abdul. In March 2005, Abdul was fined US$900 and given 24 months of informal probation after pleading &quot;nolo contendere&quot; (no contest) to misdemeanor hit-and-run driving. She was ordered to pay US$775 for damage to the other car.

=== 2005 accusations by Corey Clark ===
In May 2005, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Primetime Live&quot; reported claims by season 2 &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant Corey Clark that he and Abdul had had an affair during that season, and that she had coached him on how to succeed in the competition. Some considered Clark&#x27;s timing suspicious as he was marketing a CD and trying to get a book deal, but Clark said that his career was being prejudiced because of his relationship with Abdul, and that is why he came forward with the information to clear his name.

For the most part, Abdul refused to comment on Clark&#x27;s allegations. Simon Cowell came to Abdul&#x27;s defense, stating, &quot;It was just somebody using her to get a lot of publicity for an appalling record, full stop.&quot; Abdul appeared in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit, making light of the situation. In August 2005, the Fox network confirmed that Abdul would be returning to the show, as the investigation had found &quot;insufficient evidence that the communications between Mr. Clark and Ms. Abdul in any way aided his performance&quot;.

=== 2008 stalking incident ===
On November 11, 2008, a 30-year-old woman named Paula Goodspeed was found dead in her car outside of Abdul&#x27;s Los Angeles home in Sherman Oaks, California. The death was ruled a suicide by drug overdose, and she was found surrounded by prescription pills, along with photos and CDs of Abdul. Goodspeed was an obsessive fan of Abdul, having legally changed her name to Paula, drawn many pictures of her, sent her flowers and auditioned for Abdul on season 5 of &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2005 at a stop in Austin, Texas, before being dismissed from the show. Goodspeed had been accused in the press of being a celebrity stalker but her relatives disputed the claim.

=== 2023 sexual assault lawsuit against Nigel Lythgoe===
On December 29, 2023, Abdul filed a lawsuit accusing producer Nigel Lythgoe of sexual assault when they worked together on &quot;American Idol&quot; in the 2000s. Lythgoe denied the allegations. It was reported in December 2024 that the case had been settled. Abdul commented on the settlement, &quot;I am grateful that this chapter has successfully come to a close and is now something I can now put behind me,&quot; while expressing optimism that her experience could inspire women facing similar obstacles.

<text>Project Gutenberg (PG) is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, as well as to &quot;encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks.&quot; It was founded in 1971 by American writer Michael S. Hart and is the oldest digital library. Most of the items in its collection are the full texts of books or individual stories in the public domain. All files can be accessed for free under an open format layout, available on almost any computer. , Project Gutenberg had reached 70,000 items in its collection of free eBooks.

The releases are available in plain text as well as other formats, such as HTML, PDF, EPUB, MOBI, and Plucker wherever possible. Most releases are in the English language, but many non-English works are also available. There are multiple affiliated projects that provide additional content, including region- and language-specific works. Project Gutenberg is closely affiliated with Distributed Proofreaders, an Internet-based community for proofreading scanned texts.

Project Gutenberg is named after the inventor Johannes Gutenberg, whose works in developing printing technology led to an increase in the mass availability of books and other text.

==History==

Michael S. Hart began Project Gutenberg in 1971 with the digitization of the United States Declaration of Independence. Hart, a student at the University of Illinois, obtained access to a Xerox Sigma V mainframe computer in the university&#x27;s Materials Research Lab. Through friendly operators, he received an account with a virtually unlimited amount of computer time; its value at that time has since been variously estimated at $100,000 or $100,000,000. Hart explained he wanted to &quot;give back&quot; this gift by doing something one could consider to be of great value. His initial goal was to make the 10,000 most consulted books available to the public at little or no charge by the end of the 20th century.

On July 4, 1971, after being inspired by a free printed copy of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, he decided to type the text into a computer, and to transmit it to other users on the computer network.
:— Gregory B. Newby

This particular computer was one of the 15 nodes on ARPANET, the computer network that would become the Internet. Hart believed one day the general public would be able to access computers and decided to make works of literature available in electronic form for free. He used a copy of the United States Declaration of Independence in his backpack, and this became the first Project Gutenberg e-text. He named the project for Johannes Gutenberg, the fifteenth century German printer who propelled the movable type printing press revolution.

By the mid-1990s, Hart was running Project Gutenberg from Illinois Benedictine College. More volunteers had joined the effort. He manually entered all of the text until 1989 when image scanners and optical character recognition software improved and became more available, making book scanning more feasible. Hart later came to an arrangement with Carnegie Mellon University, which agreed to administer Project Gutenberg&#x27;s finances. As the volume of e-texts increased, volunteers began to take over the project&#x27;s day-to-day operations that Hart had run.

Italian volunteer Pietro Di Miceli developed and administered the first Project Gutenberg website and started the development of the Project online Catalog. In his ten years in this role (1994–2004), the Project web pages won a number of awards, often being featured in &quot;best of the Web&quot; listings, contributing to the project&#x27;s popularity.

Starting in 2004, an improved online catalog made Project Gutenberg content easier to browse, access and hyperlink. Project Gutenberg is now hosted by ibiblio at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Hart died on 6 September 2011 at his home in Urbana, Illinois, at the age of 64.

==CD and DVD project==
In August 2003, Project Gutenberg created a CD containing approximately 600 of the &quot;best&quot; e-books from the collection. The CD is available for download as an ISO image. When users are unable to download the CD, they can request to have a copy sent to them, free of charge.

In December 2003, a DVD was created containing nearly 10,000 items. At the time, this represented almost the entire collection. In early 2004, the DVD also became available by mail.

In July 2007, a new edition of the DVD was released containing over 17,000 books, and in April 2010, a dual-layer DVD was released, containing nearly 30,000 items.

The majority of the DVDs, and all of the CDs mailed by the project, were recorded on recordable media by volunteers. However, the new dual layer DVDs were manufactured, as it proved more economical than having volunteers burn them. , the project has mailed approximately 40,000 discs. As of 2017, the delivery of free CDs has been discontinued, though the ISO image is still available for download.

==Scope of collection==
, Project Gutenberg claimed over items in its collection, with an average of over 50 new e-books being added each week. These are primarily works of literature from the Western cultural tradition. In addition to literature such as novels, poetry, short stories and drama, Project Gutenberg also has cookbooks, reference works and issues of periodicals. The Project Gutenberg collection also has a few non-text items such as audio files and music-notation files.

Most releases are in English, but there are also significant numbers in many other languages. , the non-English languages most represented are: French, German, Finnish, Dutch, Italian, and Portuguese.

Whenever possible, Gutenberg releases are available in plain text, mainly using US-ASCII character encoding but frequently extended to ISO-8859-1 (needed to represent accented characters in French and Scharfes s in German, for example). Besides being copyright-free, the requirement for a Latin (character set) text version of the release had been a criterion of Michael Hart&#x27;s since the founding of Project Gutenberg, as he believed it was the format most likely to be readable in the extended future. Out of necessity, this criterion has had to be extended further for the sizable collection of texts in East Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese now in the collection, where UTF-8 is used instead.

Other formats may be released as well when submitted by volunteers. The most common non-ASCII format is HTML, which allows markup and illustrations to be included. Some project members and users have requested more advanced formats, believing them to be easier to read. But some formats that are not easily editable, such as PDF, are generally not considered to fit with the goals of Project Gutenberg. Also Project Gutenberg has two options for master formats that can be submitted (from which all other files are generated): customized versions of the Text Encoding Initiative standard (since 2005) and reStructuredText (since 2011).

Beginning in 2009, the Project Gutenberg catalog began offering auto-generated alternate file formats, including HTML (when not already provided), EPUB and plucker.

==Ideals==
Michael Hart said in 2004, &quot;The mission of Project Gutenberg is simple: &#x27;To encourage the creation and distribution of ebooks. His goal was &quot;to provide as many e-books in as many formats as possible for the entire world to read in as many languages as possible&quot;. Likewise, a project slogan is to &quot;break down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy&quot;, because its volunteers aim to continue spreading public literacy and appreciation for the literary heritage just as public libraries began to do in the late 19th century.

Project Gutenberg is intentionally decentralized; there is no selection policy dictating what texts to add. Instead, individual volunteers work on what they are interested in, or have available. The Project Gutenberg collection is intended to preserve items for the long term, so they cannot be lost by any one localized accident. In an effort to ensure this, the entire collection is backed-up regularly and mirrored on servers in many different locations.

==Copyright==
Project Gutenberg is careful to verify the status of its ebooks according to United States copyright law. Material is added to the Project Gutenberg archive only after it has received a copyright clearance, and records of these clearances are saved for future reference. Project Gutenberg does not claim new copyright on titles it publishes. Instead, it encourages their free reproduction and distribution.

Most books in the Project Gutenberg collection are distributed as public domain under United States copyright law. There are also a few copyrighted texts, such as those of science fiction author Cory Doctorow, that Project Gutenberg distributes with permission. These are subject to further restrictions as specified by the copyright holder, although they generally tend to be licensed under Creative Commons.

&quot;Project Gutenberg&quot; is a trademark of the organization, and the mark cannot be used in commercial or modified redistributions of public domain texts from the project. There is no legal impediment to the reselling of works in the public domain if all references to Project Gutenberg are removed, but Gutenberg contributors have questioned the appropriateness of directly and commercially reusing content that has been formatted by volunteers. There have been instances of books being stripped of attribution to the project and sold for profit in the Kindle Store and other booksellers, one being the 1906 book &quot;Fox Trapping&quot;.

From 2018 to 2021, the Project Gutenberg website was not accessible within Germany, as a result of a court order from S. Fischer Verlag regarding the works of Heinrich Mann, Thomas Mann and Alfred Döblin. Although they were in the public domain in the United States, the German court (Frankfurt am Main Regional Court) recognized the infringement of copyrights still active in Germany, and asserted that the Project Gutenberg website was under German jurisdiction because it hosts content in the German language and is accessible in Germany. This judgment was confirmed by the Frankfurt Court of Appeal on 30 April 2019 (11 U 27/18). The Frankfurt Court of Appeal has not given permission for a further appeal to the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), however, an application for permission to appeal has been filed with the Federal Court of Justice. As of 4 October 2020 that application was still pending (Federal Court of Justice I ZR 97/19). According to Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, &quot;In October 2021, the parties reached a settlement agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Project Gutenberg eBooks by the three authors will be blocked from Germany until their German copyright expires. Under the terms of the settlement, the all-Germany block is no longer in place. Other terms of the settlement are confidential.&quot;

The Project Gutenberg website has been blocked in Italy since May 2020, as part of a larger effort to block websites that publish newspapers and journals that are protected by copyright in Italy.

==Criticism==

The text files use the format of plain text encoded in UTF-8 and are typically wrapped at 65–70 characters, with paragraphs separated by a double line break. In recent decades, the resulting appearance and the lack of a markup possibility have often been perceived as bland and as a drawback of this format. Project Gutenberg attempts to address this by making many texts available in HTML, ePub, and PDF versions as well. HTML versions of older texts are autogenerated versions. Another not-for-profit project, Standard Ebooks, aims to address these issues with its collection of public domain titles that are formatted and styled. It corrects issues related to design and typography.

In December 1994, Project Gutenberg was criticized by the Text Encoding Initiative for failing to include documentation or discussion of the decisions unavoidable in preparing a text, or in some cases, not documenting which of several (conflicting) versions of a text has been the one digitized.

The selection of works (and editions) available has been determined by popularity, ease of scanning, being out of copyright, and other factors; this would be difficult to avoid in any crowd-sourced project.

In March 2004, an initiative was begun by Michael Hart and John S. Guagliardo to provide low-cost intellectual properties. The initial name for this project was &quot;Project Gutenberg 2&quot; (PG II), which created controversy among PG volunteers because of the re-use of the project&#x27;s trademarked name for a commercial venture.

==Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation==
In 2000, a non-profit corporation, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, Inc. 501(c)(3) EIN: 64-6221541 was chartered in Mississippi, United States, to handle the project&#x27;s legal needs. Donations to it are tax-deductible.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg.org/donate&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory B. Newby, while assistant professor at UNC School of Information and Library Science, and a long-time Project Gutenberg volunteer, in 2001, became the foundation&#x27;s first CEO, later Arctic Region Supercomputing Center Director, later Compute Canada&#x27;s Chief Technology Officer.

==Partners==
* Project Gutenberg Consortia Center specializes in collections of collections. These do not have the editorial oversight or consistent formatting of the main Project Gutenberg. Thematic collections, as well as numerous languages, are featured. This is sponsored by &quot;worldlibrary.net&quot;, which hosts &quot;self.gutenberg.org&quot;, a self-publishing portal.
* ibiblio, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, now hosts &quot;Project Gutenberg&quot;
* Distributed Proofreaders: In 2000, Charles Franks founded Distributed Proofreaders (DP), which allowed the proofreading of scanned texts to be distributed among many volunteers over the Internet. This effort increased the number and variety of texts being added to Project Gutenberg, as well as making it easier for new volunteers to start contributing. DP became officially affiliated with Project Gutenberg in 2002. , the 36,000+ DP-contributed books comprised almost two-thirds of the nearly books in Project Gutenberg.

==Sister projects==
All sister projects are independent organizations that share the same ideals and have been given permission to use the &quot;Project Gutenberg&quot; trademark. They often have a particular national or linguistic focus.

<text>A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network for interconnecting electronic devices within an individual person&#x27;s workspace. A PAN provides data transmission among devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets and personal digital assistants. PANs can be used for communication among the personal devices themselves, or for connecting to a higher level network and the Internet where one master device takes up the role as gateway. 

A PAN may be carried over wired interfaces such as USB, but is predominantly carried wirelessly, also called a wireless personal area network (WPAN). A PAN is wirelessly carried over a low-powered, short-distance wireless network technology such as IrDA, Wireless USB, Bluetooth, NearLink or Zigbee. The reach of a WPAN varies from a few centimeters to a few meters. WPANs specifically tailored for low-power operation of the sensors are sometimes also called low-power personal area network (LPPAN) to better distinguish them from low-power wide-area network (LPWAN).

==Wired==

Wired personal area networks provide short connections between peripherals. Example technologies include USB, IEEE 1394 and Thunderbolt.

==Wireless==
A wireless personal area network (WPAN) is a personal area network in which the connections are wireless. IEEE 802.15 has produced standards for several types of PANs operating in the ISM band including Bluetooth. The Infrared Data Association (IrDA) has produced standards for WPANs that operate using infrared communications.

===Bluetooth===

Bluetooth uses short-range radio waves. Uses in a WPAN include, for example, Bluetooth devices such as keyboards, pointing devices, audio headsets, and printers that may connect to smartwatches, cell phones, or computers. A Bluetooth WPAN is also called a &quot;piconet&quot;, and is composed of up to 8 active devices in a master-slave relationship (a very large number of additional devices can be connected in &quot;parked&quot; mode). The first Bluetooth device in the piconet is the master, and all other devices are slaves that communicate with the master. A piconet typically has a range of , although ranges of up to can be reached under ideal circumstances. Long-range Bluetooth routers with augmented antenna arrays connect Bluetooth devices up to .

With Bluetooth mesh networking the range and number of devices is extended by using mesh networking techniques to relay information from one device to another. Such a network doesn&#x27;t have a master device and may or may not be treated as a WPAN.

===IrDA===
IrDA uses infrared light, which has a frequency below the human eye&#x27;s sensitivity. Infrared is used in other wireless communications applications, for instance, in remote controls. Typical WPAN devices that use IrDA include printers, keyboards, and other serial communication interfaces.

<text>A personal digital assistant (PDA) is a multi-purpose mobile device which functions as a personal information manager. Following a boom in the 1990s and 2000s, PDAs were mostly displaced by the widespread adoption of more highly capable smartphones, in particular those based on iOS and Android in the late 2000s, and thus saw a rapid decline.

A PDA has an electronic visual display. Most models also have audio capabilities, allowing usage as a portable media player, and also enabling many of them to be used as telephones. By the early 2000s, nearly all PDA models had the ability to access the Internet, intranets or extranets via Wi-Fi or Wireless WANs, and since then generally included a web browser. Sometimes, instead of buttons, later PDAs employ touchscreen technology.

== History ==

The first PDA, the Organiser, was released in 1984 by Psion, followed by Psion&#x27;s Series 3, in 1991. The latter began to resemble the more familiar PDA style, including a full keyboard. The term &quot;PDA&quot; was first used on 7 January 1992 by Apple Inc. CEO John Sculley at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, referring to the Apple Newton.
In 1994, IBM introduced the first PDA with analog cellular phone functionality, the IBM Simon, which can also be considered the first smartphone. Then in 1996, Nokia introduced a PDA with digital cellphone functionality, the 9000 Communicator.

Another early entrant in this market was Palm, with a line of PDA products which began in March 1996. Palm would eventually be the dominant vendor of PDAs until the rising popularity of Pocket PC devices in the early 2000s.

By the mid-2000s most PDAs had morphed into smartphones as classic PDAs without cellular radios were increasingly becoming uncommon.

==Typical features==
A typical PDA has a touchscreen for navigation, a memory card slot for data storage, and IrDA, Bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi. However, some PDAs may not have a touchscreen, using soft keys, a directional pad, and a numeric keypad or a thumb keyboard for input. To have the functions expected of a PDA, a device&#x27;s software typically includes an appointment calendar, a to-do list, an address book for contacts, a calculator, and some sort of memo (or &quot;note&quot;) program. PDAs with wireless data connections also typically include an email client and a Web browser, and may or may not include telephony functionality.

===Touchscreen===

Many of the original PDAs, such as the Apple Newton and Palm Pilot, featured a touchscreen for user interaction, having only a few buttons—usually reserved for shortcuts to often-used programs. Some touchscreen PDAs, including Windows Mobile devices, had a detachable stylus to facilitate making selections. The user interacts with the device by tapping the screen to select buttons or issue commands, or by dragging a finger (or the stylus) on the screen to make selections or scroll.

Typical methods of entering text on touchscreen PDAs include:

* A virtual keyboard, where a keyboard is shown on the touchscreen. Text is entered by tapping the on-screen keyboard with a finger or stylus.
* An external keyboard connected via USB, Infrared port, or Bluetooth. Some users may choose a chorded keyboard for one-handed use.
* Handwriting recognition, where letters or words are written on the touchscreen, often with a stylus, and the PDA converts the input to text. Recognition and computation of handwritten horizontal and vertical formulas, such as &quot;1 + 2 =&quot;, may also be a feature.
* Stroke recognition allows the user to make a predefined set of strokes on the touchscreen, sometimes in a special input area, representing the various characters to be input. The strokes are often simplified character shapes, making them easier for the device to recognize. One widely known stroke recognition system is Palm&#x27;s Graffiti.

Despite research and development projects, end-users experienced mixed results with handwriting recognition systems. Some found it frustrating and inaccurate, while others were satisfied with the quality of the recognition.

Touchscreen PDAs intended for business use, such as the BlackBerry and Palm Treo, usually also offer full keyboards and scroll wheels or thumbwheels to facilitate data entry and navigation. Many touchscreen PDAs support some form of external keyboard as well. Specialized folding keyboards, which offer a full-sized keyboard but collapse into a compact size for transport, were made available for many models. External keyboards may attach to the PDA directly, using a cable, or may use wireless technology such as infrared or Bluetooth to connect to the PDA. Newer PDAs, such as the HTC HD2, Palm Pre, Pre Plus, Pixi, and Pixi Plus, as well as devices running the Android operating system, include more advanced forms of touchscreen that can register multiple touches simultaneously. These &quot;multi-touch&quot; displays allow for more sophisticated interfaces using various gestures entered with one or more fingers.

===Memory cards===
Although many early PDAs did not have memory card slots, later models had either some form of Secure Digital (SD) slot, a CompactFlash slot or a combination of the two. Although designed for memory, Secure Digital Input/Output (SDIO) and CompactFlash cards were made available that provided peripheral accessories like Wi-Fi or digital cameras to devices with software support. Some PDAs also have a USB port, mainly for USB flash drives. Some PDAs use microSD cards, which are electronically compatible with SD cards, but have a much smaller physical size.

===Wired connectivity===
While early PDAs connected to a user&#x27;s personal computer via serial ports and other proprietary connections, later models connect via a USB cable. Older PDAs were unable to connect to each other via USB, as their implementations of USB did not support acting as the &quot;host&quot;. Some early PDAs were able to connect to the Internet indirectly by means of an external modem connected via the PDA&#x27;s serial port or &quot;sync&quot; connector, or directly by using an expansion card that provided an Ethernet port.

===Wireless connectivity===
Most PDAs use Bluetooth, a popular wireless protocol for mobile devices. Bluetooth can be used to connect keyboards, headsets, GPS receivers, and other nearby accessories. It is also possible to transfer files between PDAs that have Bluetooth. Many PDAs have Wi-Fi wireless network connectivity and can connect to Wi-Fi hotspots. All smartphones, and some other PDAs, can connect to Wireless Wide Area Networks, such as those provided by cellular telecommunications companies. Older PDAs, from the 1990s to 2006, typically had an IrDA (infrared) port allowing short-range, line-of-sight wireless communication. Few later models used this technology, as it had been supplanted by Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. IrDA allows communication between two PDAs, or between a PDA and any device with an IrDA port or adapter. Some contemporary printers have IrDA receivers, allowing IrDA-equipped PDAs to print to them, if the PDA&#x27;s operating system supports it. Universal PDA keyboards designed for these older PDAs use infrared technology, due to cost and a lack of wireless interference.

===Synchronization===
Most PDAs can synchronize their data with applications on a user&#x27;s computer, allowing the user to update contact, schedule, or other information on their computer, using software such as Microsoft Outlook or ACT!, and have that same data transferred to the PDA—or transfer updated information from the PDA back to the computer, eliminating the need for the user to update their data in two places. Synchronization also prevents the loss of information stored on the device if it is lost, stolen, or destroyed. When the PDA is repaired or replaced, it can be &quot;re-synced&quot; with the computer, restoring the user&#x27;s data. Some users found that data input was quicker on their computer than on their PDA since text input via a touchscreen or small-scale keyboard was slower than a full-size keyboard. Transferring data to a PDA via the computer was, therefore, a lot quicker than having to manually input all data on the handheld device.

Most PDAs come with the ability to synchronize to a computer. This is done through &quot;synchronization software&quot; provided with the handheld, or sometimes with the computer&#x27;s operating system. Examples of synchronization software include:

* HotSync Manager, for Palm OS PDAs
* Microsoft ActiveSync, used by Windows XP and older Windows operating systems to synchronize with Windows Mobile, Pocket PC, and Windows CE PDAs, as well as PDAs running iOS, Palm OS, and Symbian
* Microsoft Windows Mobile Device Center for Windows Vista, which supports Microsoft Windows Mobile and Pocket PC devices
* Apple iTunes used on Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows to sync iOS devices
* iSync, included with Mac OS X, can synchronize many SyncML-enabled PDAs
* BlackBerry Desktop Software, used to sync BlackBerry devices.

These programs allow the PDA to be synchronized with a personal information manager, which may be part of the computer&#x27;s operating system, provided with the PDA, or sold separately by a third party. For example, the RIM BlackBerry came with RIM&#x27;s &quot;Desktop Manager&quot; program, which can synchronize to both Microsoft Outlook and ACT!. Other PDAs come only with their own proprietary software. For example, some early Palm OS PDAs came only with Palm Desktop, while later Palm PDAs—such as the Treo 650—have the ability to sync to Palm Desktop or Microsoft Outlook. Microsoft&#x27;s ActiveSync and Windows Mobile Device Center only synchronized with Microsoft Outlook or a Microsoft Exchange server. Third-party synchronization software was also available for some PDAs from companies like CommonTime and CompanionLink. Third-party software can be used to synchronize PDAs to other personal information managers that are not supported by the PDA manufacturers (for example, GoldMine and IBM Lotus Notes).

====Wireless synchronization====
Some PDAs can synchronize some or all of their data using their wireless networking capabilities, rather than having to be directly connected to a personal computer via a cable. Devices running Palm&#x27;s webOS or Google&#x27;s Android operating system primarily sync with the cloud. For example, if Gmail is used, information in contacts, email, and calendars can be synchronized between the PDA and Google&#x27;s servers. RIM sells BlackBerry Enterprise Server to corporations so that corporate BlackBerry users can wirelessly synchronize their PDAs with the company&#x27;s Microsoft Exchange Server, IBM Lotus Domino, or Novell GroupWise servers. Email, calendar entries, contacts, tasks, and memos kept on the company&#x27;s server are automatically synchronized with the BlackBerry.

==Operating systems of PDAs==
The most common operating systems pre-installed on PDAs are:

* Palm OS
* Microsoft Windows Mobile (Pocket PC) with a Windows CE kernel

Other, rarely used operating systems:

* EPOC, then Symbian OS (in mobile phone + PDA combos)
* Linux (e.g. VR3, iPAQ, Sharp Zaurus PDA, Opie, GPE, Familiar Linux etc.)
* Newton
* QNX (also on iPAQ)

==Automobile navigation==
Some PDAs include Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. Other PDAs are compatible with external GPS-receiver add-ons that use the PDA&#x27;s processor and screen to display location information. PDAs with GPS functionality can be used for automotive navigation. Integrated PDAs were fitted as standard on new cars throughout the 2000&#x27;s. PDA-based GPS can also display traffic conditions, perform dynamic routing, and show known locations of roadside mobile radar guns. TomTom, Garmin, and iGO offered GPS navigation software for PDAs.

==Ruggedized==
Some businesses and government organizations rely upon rugged PDAs, sometimes known as enterprise digital assistants (EDAs) or mobile computers, for mobile data applications. These PDAs have features that make them more robust and able to handle inclement weather, jolts, and moisture. EDAs often have extra features for data capture, such as barcode readers, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers, magnetic stripe card readers, or smart card readers. These features are designed to facilitate the use of these devices to scan product or item codes.

Typical applications include:

* Access control and security
* Capital asset maintenance
* Facilities maintenance and management
* Infection control audit and surveillance within healthcare environments
* Medical treatment and recordkeeping in hospitals
* Meter reading by utilities
* Military (U.S. Army, Pakistan Army)
* Package delivery
* Park and wildlife rangers
* Parking enforcement
* Route accounting
* Supply chain management in warehouses
* Taxicab allocation and routing
* Waiter and waitress applications in restaurants and hospitality venues
* Wildlife biologists

==Educational uses==
PDAs and handheld devices were allowed in many classrooms for digital note-taking. Students could spell-check, modify, and amend their class notes on a PDA. Some educators distributed course material through the Internet or infrared file-sharing functions of the PDA. Textbook publishers released e-books, which can be uploaded directly to a PDA, reducing the number of textbooks students were required to carry. Brighton and Sussex Medical School in the UK was the first medical school to provide wide scale use of PDAs to its undergraduate students. The learning opportunities provided by having PDAs complete with a suite of key medical texts were studied with results showing that learning occurred in context with timely access to key facts and through consolidation of knowledge via repetition. The PDA was an important addition to the learning ecology rather than a replacement. Software companies also developed PDA programs to meet the instructional needs of educational institutions, such as dictionaries, thesauri, word processing software, encyclopedias, webinars and digital lesson planners.

===Recreational uses===
PDAs were used by music enthusiasts to play a variety of music file formats. Many PDAs include the functionality of an MP3 player. Road rally enthusiasts can use PDAs to calculate distance, speed, and time. This information may be used for navigation, or the PDA&#x27;s GPS functions can be used for navigation. Underwater divers can use PDAs to plan breathing gas mixtures and decompression schedules using software such as &quot;V-Planner&quot;.

<text>The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX; ) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines application programming interfaces (APIs), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility (portability) with variants of Unix and other operating systems. POSIX is also a trademark of the IEEE. POSIX is intended to be used by both application and system developers.

==Name==
Originally, the name &quot;POSIX&quot; referred to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, released in 1988. The family of POSIX standards is formally designated as IEEE 1003 and the ISO/IEC standard number is ISO/IEC 9945.

The standards emerged from a project that began in 1984 building on work from related activity in the &quot;/usr/group&quot; association. Richard Stallman suggested the name &quot;POSIX&quot; to the IEEE instead of the former &quot;IEEE-IX&quot;. The committee found it more easily pronounceable and memorable, and thus adopted it.

==Overview==
Unix was selected as the basis for a standard system interface partly because it was &quot;manufacturer-neutral&quot;. However, several major versions of Unix existed—so there was a need to develop a common-denominator system. The POSIX specifications for Unix-like operating systems originally consisted of a single document for the core programming interface, but eventually grew to 19 separate documents (POSIX.1, POSIX.2, etc.). The standardized user command line and scripting interface were based on the UNIX System V shell. Many user-level programs, services, and utilities (including awk, echo, ed) were also standardized, along with required program-level services (including basic I/O: file, terminal, and network). POSIX also defines a standard threading library API which is supported by most modern operating systems. In 2008, most parts of POSIX were combined into a single standard &quot;(IEEE Std 1003.1-2008&quot;, also known as &quot;POSIX.1-2008).&quot;

, POSIX documentation is divided into two parts:
* POSIX.1, 2013 Edition: POSIX Base Definitions, System Interfaces, and Commands and Utilities (which include POSIX.1, extensions for POSIX.1, Real-time Services, Threads Interface, Real-time Extensions, Security Interface, Network File Access and Network Process-to-Process Communications, User Portability Extensions, Corrections and Extensions, Protection and Control Utilities and Batch System Utilities. This is POSIX 1003.1-2008 with Technical Corrigendum 1.)
* POSIX Conformance Testing: A test suite for POSIX accompanies the standard: VSX-PCTS or the VSX POSIX Conformance Test Suite.

The development of the POSIX standard takes place in the Austin Group (a joint working group among the IEEE, The Open Group, and the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 15).

==Versions==
===Parts before 1997===
Before 1997, POSIX comprised several standards:
* POSIX.1: Core Services (incorporates Standard ANSI C) (IEEE Std 1003.1-1988)
** Process Creation and Control
** Signals
*** Floating Point Exceptions
*** Segmentation / Memory Violations
*** Illegal Instructions
*** Bus Errors
*** Timers
** File and Directory Operations
** Pipes
** C Library (Standard C)
** The POSIX terminal interface
* POSIX.1b: Real-time extensions (IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993, later appearing as librt—the Realtime Extensions library)
** Priority Scheduling
** Real-Time Signals
** Clocks and Timers
** Semaphores
** Message Passing
** Shared Memory
** Asynchronous and Synchronous I/O
** Memory Locking Interface
* POSIX.1c: Threads extensions (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995)
** Thread Creation, Control, and Cleanup
** Thread Scheduling
** Thread Synchronization
** Signal Handling
* POSIX.2: Shell and Utilities (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992)
** Command Interpreter
** Utility Programs

===Versions after 1997===
After 1997, the Austin Group developed the POSIX revisions. The specifications are known under the name Single UNIX Specification, before they become a POSIX standard when formally approved by the ISO.

====POSIX.1-2001 (with two TCs)====
&quot;POSIX.1-2001&quot; (or IEEE Std 1003.1-2001) equates to the &quot;Single UNIX Specification, version 3&quot; minus &quot;X/Open Curses&quot;.

This standard consisted of:
* the Base Definitions, Issue 6,
* the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 6,
* the Commands and Utilities, Issue 6.

IEEE Std 1003.1-2004 involved a minor update of POSIX.1-2001. It incorporated two minor updates or errata referred to as &quot;Technical Corrigenda&quot; (TCs). Its contents are available on the web.

====POSIX.1-2008 (with two TCs)====
&quot;Base Specifications, Issue 7&quot; (or &quot;IEEE Std 1003.1-2008&quot;, 2016 Edition).

This standard consists of:
* the Base Definitions, Issue 7,
* the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 7,
* the Commands and Utilities, Issue 7,
* the Rationale volume.

====POSIX.1-2017====
IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 (Revision of IEEE Std 1003.1-2008) - IEEE Standard for Information Technology—Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX(R)) Base Specifications, Issue 7 is available from either The Open Group or IEEE. It is technically identical to POSIX.1-2008 with Technical Corrigenda 1 and 2 applied. Its contents are available on the web.

====POSIX.1-2024====
IEEE Std 1003.1-2024 - IEEE Standard for Information Technology—Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX(R)) Base Specifications, Issue 8 was published on 14 June 2024. Its contents are available on the web.

==Controversies==
===512- vs 1024-byte blocks===
POSIX mandates 512-byte default block sizes for the df and du utilities, reflecting the typical size of blocks on disks. When Richard Stallman and the GNU team were implementing POSIX for the GNU operating system, they objected to this on the grounds that most people think in terms of 1024 byte (or 1 KiB) blocks. The environment variable was introduced to allow the user to force the standards-compliant behaviour. The variable name was later changed to . This variable is now also used for a number of other behaviour quirks.

==POSIX-oriented operating systems==
Depending upon the degree of compliance with the standards, one can classify operating systems as fully or partly POSIX compatible.

===POSIX-certified===
Current versions of the following operating systems have been certified to conform to one or more of the various POSIX standards. This means that they passed the automated conformance tests and their certification has not expired and the operating system has not been discontinued.
*AIX
*HP-UX
*INTEGRITY
*macOS (since Mac OS X Leopard)
*OpenServer
*UnixWare
*VxWorks
*z/OS
===Formerly POSIX-certified===
Some versions of the following operating systems had been certified to conform to one or more of the various POSIX standards. This means that they passed the automated conformance tests. The certification has expired and some of the operating systems have been discontinued.
*EulerOS (exp. 2022)
*Inspur K-UX (exp. 2019)
*IRIX (defunct 2006)
*OS/390 (defunct 2004)
*QNX Neutrino
*Solaris (exp. 2019)
*Tru64 (defunct 2010)
*LiteOS (defunct 2020)
===Mostly POSIX-compliant===
The following are not certified as POSIX compliant yet comply in large part:

*Android (Available through Android NDK)
*Darwin (core of macOS and iOS)
*DragonFly BSD
*FreeBSD

====POSIX for Microsoft Windows====
*Cygwin provides a largely POSIX-compliant development and run-time environment for Microsoft Windows.
*MinGW, a fork of Cygwin, provides a less POSIX-compliant development environment and supports compatible C-programmed applications via Msvcrt, Microsoft&#x27;s old Visual C runtime library.
*libunistd, a largely POSIX-compliant development library originally created to build the Linux-based C/C++ source code of CinePaint as is in Microsoft Visual Studio. A lightweight implementation that has POSIX-compatible header files that map POSIX APIs to call their Windows API counterparts.
*Microsoft POSIX subsystem, an optional Windows subsystem included in Windows NT-based operating systems up to Windows 2000. It supported POSIX.1 as it stood in the 1990 revision, without threads or sockets.
*Interix, originally OpenNT by Softway Systems, Inc., is an upgrade and replacement for Microsoft POSIX subsystem that was purchased by Microsoft in 1999. It was initially marketed as a stand-alone add-on product and then later included as a component in Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) and finally incorporated as a component in Windows Server 2003 R2 and later Windows OS releases under the name &quot;Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications&quot; (SUA); later made deprecated in 2012 (Windows 8) and dropped in 2013 (2012 R2, 8.1). It enables full POSIX compliance for certain Microsoft Windows products.
*Windows Subsystem for Linux, also known as WSL, is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10 and 11 using a Linux image such as Ubuntu, Debian, or OpenSUSE among others, acting as an upgrade and replacement for Windows Services for UNIX. It was released in beta in April 2016. The first distribution available was Ubuntu.
*UWIN from AT&amp;T Research implements a POSIX layer on top of the Win32 APIs.
*MKS Toolkit, originally created for MS-DOS, is a software package produced and maintained by MKS Inc. that provides a Unix-like environment for scripting, connectivity and porting Unix and Linux software to both 32- and 64-bit Microsoft Windows systems. A subset of it was included in the first release of Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) in 1998.
*Windows C Runtime Library and Windows Sockets API implement commonly used POSIX API functions for file, time, environment, and socket access, although the support remains largely incomplete and not fully interoperable with POSIX-compliant implementations.

====POSIX for OS/2====
Mostly POSIX compliant environments for OS/2:
* emx+gcc – largely POSIX compliant

====POSIX for DOS====
Partially POSIX compliant environments for DOS include:
* emx+gcc – largely POSIX compliant
* DJGPP – partially POSIX compliant
* DR-DOS multitasking core via – a POSIX threads frontend API extension is available
====Compliant via compatibility layer====

The following are not officially certified as POSIX compatible, but they conform in large part to the standards by implementing POSIX support via some sort of compatibility feature (usually translation libraries, or a layer atop the kernel). Without these features, they are usually non-compliant.

*AmigaOS (through the ixemul library or vbcc_PosixLib)
*eCos – POSIX is part of the standard distribution, and used by many applications. &#x27;external links&#x27; section below has more information.
*IBM i (through the PASE compatibility layer)
*MorphOS (through the built-in ixemul library)
*OpenVMS (through optional POSIX package)
*Plan 9 from Bell Labs APE - ANSI/POSIX Environment
*RIOT (through optional POSIX module)
*Symbian OS with PIPS (PIPS Is POSIX on Symbian)
*VAXELN (partial support of 1003.1 and 1003.4 through the VAXELN POSIX runtime library)
*Windows NT kernel when using Microsoft SFU 3.5 or SUA
**Windows 2000 Server or Professional with Service Pack 3 or later. To be POSIX compliant, one must activate optional features of Windows NT and Windows 2000 Server.
**Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 1 or later
**Windows Server 2003
**Windows Server 2008 and Ultimate and Enterprise versions of Windows Vista
**Windows Server 2008 R2 and Ultimate and Enterprise versions of Windows 7
**albeit deprecated, still available for Windows Server 2012 and Enterprise version of Windows 8

<text>The Personal Telco Project (or PTP) is a wireless community network project in Portland, Oregon. It was founded by Adam Shand in November 2000 after he read a Slashdot article about the Consume The Net project in London.

PTP has wireless hotspots offering free Internet access at locations around Portland including Pioneer Courthouse Square, three public parks, and several restaurants and coffee shops using Wi-Fi.
In 2005 PTP was involved in a grant-funded project to bring free wireless Internet to an entire neighborhood in North Portland, along N. Mississippi Avenue.

PTP is a non-profit organization in the state of Oregon, and received its 501(c)(3) status (a federal tax exemption granted to charitable organizations) in early 2003.

PTP made US news in August 2002 when their hotspot at Pioneer Courthouse Square was blocked by a for-fee hotspot at a nearby Starbucks coffee shop. The problem was resolved amicably when the for-fee hotspot moved their connection to another channel.

On March 4, 2003, a study was published stating Portland had more wireless hotspots per capita than any other U.S. city. This was due in part to PTP&#x27;s advocacy.

<text>Paul Edward Huston (born April 2, 1967), better known by his stage name Prince Paul, is an American record producer, disc jockey and recording artist from Amityville, New York. Paul began his career as a DJ for Stetsasonic. He has worked on albums by Boogie Down Productions, Gravediggaz, MC Lyte, Big Daddy Kane and 3rd Bass, among others. Major recognition for Prince Paul came when he produced De La Soul&#x27;s debut album &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; (1989), in which he pioneered new approaches to hip hop production, mixing and sampling, notably by including comedy sketches.

His first solo album, &quot;&quot;, came out in 1997, followed by a second album, &quot;A Prince Among Thieves&quot;, in 1999.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life ===
Paul Edward Huston was born on April 2, 1967 in Amityville, New York. Paul was interested in music from a young age and started collecting vinyl when he was five. According to his mother, he was mature for his age and tended to hang out with older friends.

When he was in fifth grade he started DJing, using a makeshift setup of one Lafayette turntable hooked up to another turntable set and using the balance knob as a fader. In 1981, at age 14, Paul performed a DJ set at The Ace Center Amityville that helped him gain recognition. He did a routine with Trouble Funk&#x27;s &quot;Pump Me Up&quot; which he later described as his &quot;claim to fame.&quot; After The Ace Center performance, Paul started doing parties and tapes with Biz Markie while he was in 8th grade. At the same time, Paul&#x27;s middle school music teacher was Everett Collins, a drummer for The Isley Brothers. Collins later introduced Paul to De La Soul member Maseo.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
Prince Paul began performing with groups during his teenage years, first joining a group called Soul Brothers with his longtime friend Don Newkirk. Paul was one of the original members of Stetsasonic. He joined the group in 1984 after impressing Daddy-O with his routine in the &quot;Brevoit Day Celebration&quot; DJ battle in Brooklyn. Daddy-O was struck by Paul&#x27;s energy, saying that he performed his routine with Liquid Liquid&#x27;s song &quot;Cavern&quot;, &quot;like he was mad at the turntables&quot;. Paul credits Grandmaster Flash&#x27;s song &quot;Flash To The Beat&quot; as the reason he purchased his drum machine.

Prince Paul produced &quot;The Gas Face&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn-Queens&quot; on 3rd Bass&#x27; 1989 debut &quot;The Cactus Album.&quot; The original version of &quot;The Gas Face&quot; was recorded on 4-track cassette tape and started out as mistake. Paul wanted to change the beat after he realized the pattern was not what he had intended, but MC Serch and Pete Nice convinced him to keep it. The song was recorded on the 4th of July.

Paul also worked on De La Soul&#x27;s first three albums, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; (1989), &quot;De La Soul Is Dead&quot; (1991), and &quot;Buhloone Mindstate&quot; (1993). &quot;De La Soul is Dead&quot; received a five mic album review from &quot;The Source&quot;. According to Paul, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; (1989) had a budget of about $20,000 and took a month and a half to make. In Brian Coleman&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;Check the Technique&quot;, Paul reflected on his work with De La Soul by saying, &quot;If there was ever a sign of the existence of God, De La Soul would be that proof to me. I&#x27;ve never had such a perfect fit in any other production situation.&quot;

In 1990, Russell Simmons gave Prince Paul an imprint under his Def Jam label, however the only album, &quot;It Takes a Nation of Suckers to Let Us In&quot; by Resident Alien, was never officially released. It is available as an unofficial release, which is different to a bootleg.

Along with Frukwan of Stetsasonic, Too Poetic of Brothers Grimm, and the RZA of Wu-Tang Clan, Prince Paul formed the group Gravediggaz. They recorded a demo together in 1991 and released their first album &quot;Niggamortis/6 Feet Deep&quot; in 1994 on Gee Street Records. Before signing a deal with Gee Street, Eazy-E wanted to release the album on Ruthless Records. Paul flew to Los Angeles to have a meeting with Eazy-E and Jerry Heller but was unimpressed with the contract and declined. After the group signed to Gee Street, Paul estimated that it took them about six months to complete the album.

Prince Paul also contributed to several other projects during this time period. He produced three songs for Boogie Down Productions&#x27; 1992 album &quot;Sex and Violence&quot;, though later expressed frustration that the group released the album before he had finalized and polished those tracks. In 1995, Paul and Teo Macero collaborated to produce the solo debut from guitarist Vernon Reid, and in 1996 he appeared on the compilation album &quot;America Is Dying Slowly&quot;. Additionally, Paul joined forces with Amityville rapper Superstar to launch a supergroup called Horror City. Paul produced a Horror City album, but proved unable to successfully market the album to any record labels. Ultimately, Paul decided to offer &quot;Horror City&quot; as a free download in 2010.

In 1996, during the early recording sessions for &quot;Stakes Is High&quot;, De La Soul and Prince Paul decided to part ways. Although Paul was not involved in the making of the album, he has praised it in several interviews, once saying, &quot;I was going through a serious transition period in my life when that album dropped. I was trying to figure out the next thing I was going to do; I was going through a custody case for my son, and I was running out of money. There were a lot of things going on at the time and in a sense, that album pulled me through everything.&quot;

After splitting from De La Soul, Paul released two solo albums in the following years: &quot;&quot; (1996) and &quot;A Prince Among Thieves&quot; (1999). These albums featured a wide range of rappers, including Big Daddy Kane, Xzibit, Kool Keith, and Everlast. When Paul was recording &quot;Psychoanalysis&quot; he thought his career was over and had a hard time finding people who wanted to be involved with the project. Many of the vocals were provided by friends of his from outside the music industry. Years later he recalled thinking, &quot;Some people might get butt-hurt about it, but so what? It&#x27;s probably the last record I&#x27;ll make anyway,&quot; during the recording of &quot;Beautiful Night (Manic Psychopath)&quot;. The song is very dark and deals with date rape, racism, and violence.

According to Paul, he originally proposed the idea for &quot;A Prince Among Thieves&quot; to Russell Simmons in the early 1990s but Simmons was not interested. While describing his goals for the album in an interview he said, &quot;I wanted to make a movie on wax. I wanted to make an adults&#x27; kid album.&quot; To prepare for the album he watched many B movies and tried to use scenes from various films as inspiration. On &quot;A Prince Among Thieves&quot;, Paul also repurposed some of the beats he had initially composed for &quot;Horror City&quot;. In addition to the extensive list of rappers on the album, Paul reached out to Vanilla Ice to perform on &quot;Handle Your Time&quot; with Sadat X and Xzibit. He also reached out to The Notorious B.I.G. about playing a role on the album and was supposed to meet up with him the night he was murdered.

Prince Paul formed the duo Handsome Boy Modeling School with Dan the Automator. Their 1999 debut album, &quot;So... How&#x27;s Your Girl?&quot;, featured Sean Lennon, Del the Funky Homosapien, Alec Empire, and Don Novello.

=== 21st century ===
Paul contributed to multiple projects in the year 2000. His work from that year includes the song &quot;The Fantabulous Rap Extravaganza&quot; on Deltron 3030&#x27;s self-titled album, as well as &quot;It&#x27;s Very Stimulating&quot;, the debut EP by MC Paul Barman.

Prince Paul&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Politics of the Business&quot; again featured many guests such as Chuck D, Ice-T, The Beatnuts, and Wordsworth. The latter also collaborated on a track Paul composed for &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; soundtrack. Paul followed this project with a second Handsome Boy Modeling School album, &quot;White People&quot;, in 2004. His next solo album was &quot;Itstrumental&quot; (2005). It encompasses a range of genres, relying heavily on past samples, especially from &quot;A Prince Among Thieves&quot;, and combining them with lighthearted skits about his depression. As of 2023, &quot;Itstrumental&quot; is Paul&#x27;s most recent studio album.

Paul continued to collaborate throughout the 2000s. In 2005, he produced the album &quot;The Art of Picking Up Women&quot; by the Dix, which combines some of hip-hop&#x27;s misogyny and boasting with 1960s-style R&amp;B. He also collaborated with Parliament, Don Newkirk, and Talking Heads keyboardist Bernie Worrell to release an album titled &quot;Turn My Teeth Up!&quot; (2007) under the moniker Baby Elephant. Another project Paul produced during this period was &quot;Montezuma&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, a 2009 album by Souls of Mischief. On this album, Paul extensively used vintage equipment such as the Emu SP-12, Ensoniq ASR-10, Akai MPC-60 and an Akai MPC-2000.

At the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006, Prince Paul was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for his work on Chris Rock&#x27;s &quot;Never Scared&quot;.

In 2012, Paul spoke openly in an interview about the possibility of doing another De La Soul album after Maseo had made some public comments about a reunion. In the interview, Paul states that he asked the members of De La Soul to work on a new album on and off since 1999. Though he wanted to do a reunion at one time, it seemed in the interview he had moved past the idea, partially because of the far more restrictive sampling laws that exist today. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to think about it, but I kind of like where we left it. There would be so many expectations. For me to do another De La record, I don&#x27;t think I could really live up to it. Especially in a day and age where I can&#x27;t openly sample like that.&quot;

Paul continued to provide occasional contributions to various products in the 2010s and 2020s. In 2016, he collaborated with Brazilian hip hop fusion group Broozkill! on an album titled &quot;Throwback to the Future&quot;. In 2017 Prince Paul helped to score &quot;Mogul&quot;, a Gimlet Media podcast about hip-hop scene-maker Chris Lighty. In 2020, Prince Paul co-produced the Gorillaz song &quot;Pac-Man&quot; for the band&#x27;s Song Machine web series.

In 2017, Prince Paul joined the Creators Advisory Board of Tracklib. In an interview with Tracklib, Prince Paul stated that &quot;I know Tracklib will help (producers) because it will give everybody an opportunity to sample without having to look over their shoulder.&quot;

== Equipment ==
Paul has talked about his fondness for vintage equipment in several interviews. One of his favorite pieces of vintage equipment is the Akai S900, which he credits for having a unique sound, saying, &quot;Even though it&#x27;s big and bulky, nothing sounds like that. It&#x27;s pretty flexible, it&#x27;s easy to work, and it&#x27;s easy to truncate your sample and get things tight...When you look at all this new technology, everything sounds very sterile. Everything is clean and super quiet. It kind of lacks something. When I plug that in, it&#x27;s like, &#x27;Wow, this is hip hop.&#x27;&quot;

== Record collection ==
He is known for sampling from a wide range of genres. Rapper Biz Markie once said of Paul&#x27;s production style, &quot;Prince Paul&#x27;s contribution to hip-hop is that you could use records that weren&#x27;t by James Brown or just break-beats.&quot;

== Style and influences ==
Unlike the vast majority of hip-hop producers during the 1980s and early 1990s, Paul explored many genres outside of funk and soul to extract samples. 

Chris Rock listed the &quot;Buhloone Mindstate&quot; album at number ten on his &quot;Top 25 Albums&quot; list. He credited the album as helping to shape him as a comedian. In 1999, Rock appeared on Paul&#x27;s &quot;A Prince Among Thieves.&quot; Later in 2005, Rock&#x27;s debut album was produced by Paul.

Paul credits The Bomb Squad and Public Enemy as being a significant influence on early De La Soul production, saying, &quot;Early Public Enemy production used layers upon layers and layers, and their arrangements were always super duper incredible to me. We were kind of like students to what they did.&quot; In addition to The Bomb Squad, he also lists George Clinton, Dr. Dre, Rick Rubin, and Bernie Worrell as his major influences.

While Paul continues to utilize samples, he has expanded his production to include live instrumentation, including guitar, bass guitar, and several analog keyboards. To combine elements of sampling and live instrumentation, Paul now re-plays some of his samples with instruments. In a 2010 interview he described the process by saying, &quot;I’ve gotten to the point now where I’ll re-play samples with instruments. I learned how to interpolate, change the sound, and dust it out so that when I’m re-playing certain samples, it sounds like a direct sample from a record.&quot;

Paul has credited the process of working with Dan the Automator on the Handsome Boy Modeling School project as helping him learn a great deal about production.

<text>Paul Vixie is an American computer scientist whose technical contributions include Domain Name System (DNS) protocol design and procedure, mechanisms to achieve operational robustness of DNS implementations, and significant contributions to open source software principles and methodology. He also created and launched the first successful commercial anti-spam service. He authored the standard UNIX system programs &quot;SENDS&quot;, &quot;proxynet&quot;, &quot;rtty&quot; and Vixie cron. At one point he ran his own consulting business, Vixie Enterprises. In 2002, Vixie held the record for &quot;most CERT advisories due to a single author&quot;.

==Early life==
Paul A Vixie was born on 23 May 1963 and grew up in San Francisco, and his mother&#x27;s maiden name is Killian.

&quot;There were no computers at my school. I used to cut school and go to City College of San Francisco, where they had a Honeywell system&quot; — Paul Vixie

In 1980, when George Washington High School in San Francisco told him he&#x27;d have to repeat 11th grade, he quit school and got a job as a programmer at a consulting firm.

==Career==
Vixie worked on BIND as a software engineer at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) from 1988 to 1993. After he left DEC in 1994, he founded Internet Software Consortium (ISC) in 1996 together with Rick Adams and Carl Malamud to support BIND and other software for the Internet. The activities of ISC were assumed by a new company, Internet Systems Consortium in 2004. Although ISC operates the F root name server, Vixie at one point joined the Open Root Server Network (ORSN) project and operated their L root server.

In 1995 he cofounded the Palo Alto Internet Exchange (PAIX) and, after Metromedia Fiber Network (MFN) bought it in 1999, served as the chief technology officer to MFN / AboveNet and later as the president of PAIX.

In 1998 he cofounded Mail Abuse Prevention System (MAPS), a California non-profit company with the goal of stopping email abuse.

Vixie is the author of several Request for Comments (RFC)s, including a Best Current Practice document on &quot;Classless IN-ADDR.ARPA Delegation&quot; (BCP 20), and some Unix software. He stated in 2002 that he &quot;now hold[s] the record for &#x27;most CERT advisories due to a single author.&#x27;&quot;

In 2008, Vixie served as a judge for the Mozilla Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Download Day&quot;, an attempt to set a Guinness World Record for most downloads in a single day for a new piece of software.

Vixie served on the board of trustees of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) from 2005 to 2013, and served as chairman in 2009 and 2010. Vixie also serves on the Security and Stability Advisory Committee of ICANN.

He received a Ph.D. in computer science from Keio University in 2011.

In 2013, after nearly 20 years at ISC, he founded a new company, Farsight Security, Inc. spinning off the Security Business Unit from ISC.

In 2014, Vixie was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame as an Innovator.

In 2021, Vixie&#x27;s company FarSight Security was acquired by DomainTools. Since 2022, he has been working at AWS.

<doc id="23310" wikidata="Q25546" url="?curid=23310" title="Pleistocene">
<text>The Pleistocene ( ; referred to colloquially as the &quot;Ice Age&quot;) is the geological epoch that lasted from to 11,700 years ago, spanning the Earth&#x27;s most recent period of repeated glaciations. Before a change was finally confirmed in 2009 by the International Union of Geological Sciences, the cutoff of the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene was regarded as being 1.806 million years Before Present (BP). Publications from earlier years may use either definition of the period. The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology. The name is a combination of Ancient Greek () &#x27;most&#x27; and (; Latinized as ) &#x27;new&#x27;.

At the end of the preceding Pliocene, the previously isolated North and South American continents were joined by the Isthmus of Panama, causing a faunal interchange between the two regions and changing ocean circulation patterns, with the onset of glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere occurring around 2.7 million years ago. During the Early Pleistocene (2.58–0.8 Ma), archaic humans of the genus &quot;Homo&quot; originated in Africa and spread throughout Afro-Eurasia. The end of the Early Pleistocene is marked by the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, with the cyclicity of glacial cycles changing from 41,000-year cycles to asymmetric 100,000-year cycles, making the climate variation more extreme. The Late Pleistocene witnessed the spread of modern humans outside of Africa as well as the extinction of all other human species. Humans also spread to the Australian continent and the Americas for the first time, co-incident with the extinction of most large-bodied animals in these regions.

The aridification and cooling trends of the preceding Neogene were continued in the Pleistocene. The climate was strongly variable depending on the glacial cycle, with the sea levels being up to lower than present at peak glaciation, allowing the connection of Asia and North America via Beringia and the covering of most of northern North America by the Laurentide Ice Sheet.


==Etymology==
Charles Lyell introduced the term &quot;Pleistocene&quot; in 1839 to describe strata in Sicily that had at least 70% of their molluscan fauna still living today. This distinguished it from the older Pliocene Epoch, which Lyell had originally thought to be the youngest fossil rock layer. He constructed the name &quot;Pleistocene&quot; (&#x27;most new&#x27; or &#x27;newest&#x27;) from the Greek &quot;πλεῖστος&quot; (&quot;pleīstos&quot;) &#x27;most&#x27; and &quot;καινός&quot; (&quot;kainós&quot; (Latinized as &quot;cænus&quot;) &#x27;new&#x27;). This contrasts with the immediately preceding Pliocene (&quot;newer&quot;, from &quot;πλείων&quot; (&quot;pleíōn&quot;, &quot;more&quot;) and &quot;kainós&quot;) and the immediately subsequent Holocene (&quot;wholly new&quot; or &quot;entirely new&quot;, from &quot;ὅλος&quot; (&quot;hólos&quot;, &quot;whole&quot;) and &quot;kainós&quot;) epoch, which extends to the present time.

==Dating==
The Pleistocene has been dated from 2.580 million (±0.005) to 11,700 years BP with the end date expressed in radiocarbon years as 10,000 carbon-14 years BP. It covers most of the latest period of repeated glaciation, up to and including the Younger Dryas cold spell. The end of the Younger Dryas has been dated to about 9700 BCE (11,700 calendar years BP). The end of the Younger Dryas is the official start of the current Holocene Epoch. Although it is considered an epoch, the Holocene is not significantly different from previous interglacial intervals within the Pleistocene. In the ICS timescale, the Pleistocene is divided into four stages or ages, the Gelasian, Calabrian, Chibanian (previously the unofficial &quot;Middle Pleistocene&quot;), and Upper Pleistocene (unofficially the &quot;Tarantian&quot;). In addition to these international subdivisions, various regional subdivisions are often used.

In 2009 the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) confirmed a change in time period for the Pleistocene, changing the start date from 1.806 to 2.588 million years BP, and accepted the base of the Gelasian as the base of the Pleistocene, namely the base of the Monte San Nicola GSSP. The start date has now been rounded down to 2.580 million years BP. The IUGS has yet to approve a type section, Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), for the upper Pleistocene/Holocene boundary (&quot;i.e.&quot; the upper boundary). The proposed section is the &quot;North Greenland Ice Core Project&quot; ice core 75° 06&#x27; N 42° 18&#x27; W. The lower boundary of the Pleistocene Series is formally defined magnetostratigraphically as the base of the Matuyama (C2r) chronozone, isotopic stage 103. Above this point there are notable extinctions of the calcareous nannofossils: &quot;Discoaster pentaradiatus&quot; and &quot;Discoaster surculus&quot;. The Pleistocene covers the recent period of repeated glaciations. 

The name Plio-Pleistocene has, in the past, been used to mean the last ice age. Formerly, the boundary between the two epochs was drawn at the time when the foraminiferal species &quot;Hyalinea baltica&quot; first appeared in the marine section at La Castella, Calabria, Italy. However, the revised definition of the Quaternary, by pushing back the start date of the Pleistocene to 2.58 Ma, results in the inclusion of all the recent repeated glaciations within the Pleistocene.

Radiocarbon dating is considered to be inaccurate beyond around 50,000 years ago. Marine isotope stages (MIS) derived from Oxygen isotopes are often used for giving approximate dates.

==Deposits==
Pleistocene non-marine sediments are found primarily in fluvial deposits, lakebeds, slope and loess deposits as well as in the large amounts of material moved about by glaciers. Less common are cave deposits, travertines and volcanic deposits (lavas, ashes). Pleistocene marine deposits are found primarily in shallow marine basins mostly (but with important exceptions) in areas within a few tens of kilometres of the modern shoreline. In a few geologically active areas such as the Southern California coast, Pleistocene marine deposits may be found at elevations of several hundred metres.

==Paleogeography and climate==
The modern continents were essentially at their present positions during the Pleistocene, the plates upon which they sit probably having moved no more than relative to each other since the beginning of the period. In glacial periods, the sea level would drop by up to lower than today during peak glaciation, exposing large areas of the present continental shelf as dry land.

According to Mark Lynas (through collected data), the Pleistocene&#x27;s overall climate could be characterised as a continuous El Niño with trade winds in the south Pacific weakening or heading east, warm air rising near Peru, warm water spreading from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific, and other El Niño markers.

===Glacial features===
Pleistocene climate was marked by repeated glacial cycles in which continental glaciers pushed to the 40th parallel in some places. It is estimated that, at maximum glacial extent, 30% of the Earth&#x27;s surface was covered by ice. In addition, a zone of permafrost stretched southward from the edge of the glacial sheet, a few hundred kilometres in North America, and several hundred in Eurasia. The mean annual temperature at the edge of the ice was ; at the edge of the permafrost, .

Each glacial advance tied up huge volumes of water in continental ice sheets thick, resulting in temporary sea-level drops of or more over the entire surface of the Earth. During interglacial times, such as at present, drowned coastlines were common, mitigated by isostatic or other emergent motion of some regions.

The effects of glaciation were global. Antarctica was ice-bound throughout the Pleistocene as well as the preceding Pliocene. The Andes were covered in the south by the Patagonian ice cap. There were glaciers in New Zealand and Tasmania. The current decaying glaciers of Mount Kenya, Mount Kilimanjaro, and the Ruwenzori Range in east and central Africa were larger. Glaciers existed in the mountains of Ethiopia and to the west in the Atlas Mountains.

In the northern hemisphere, many glaciers fused into one. The Cordilleran Ice Sheet covered the North American northwest; the east was covered by the Laurentide. The Fenno-Scandian ice sheet rested on northern Europe, including much of Great Britain; the Alpine ice sheet on the Alps. Scattered domes stretched across Siberia and the Arctic shelf. The northern seas were ice-covered.

South of the ice sheets large lakes accumulated because outlets were blocked and the cooler air slowed evaporation. When the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated, north-central North America was completely covered by Lake Agassiz. Over a hundred basins, now dry or nearly so, were overflowing in the North American west. Lake Bonneville, for example, stood where Great Salt Lake now does. In Eurasia, large lakes developed as a result of the runoff from the glaciers. Rivers were larger, had a more copious flow, and were braided. African lakes were fuller, apparently from decreased evaporation. Deserts, on the other hand, were drier and more extensive. Rainfall was lower because of the decreases in oceanic and other evaporation.

It has been estimated that during the Pleistocene, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet thinned by at least 500 meters, and that thinning since the Last Glacial Maximum is less than 50 meters and probably started after ca 14 ka.

===Major events===

During the 2.5 million years of the Pleistocene, numerous cold phases called glacials (Quaternary ice age), or significant advances of continental ice sheets, in Europe and North America, occurred at intervals of approximately 40,000 to 100,000 years. The long glacial periods were separated by more temperate and shorter interglacials which lasted about 10,000–15,000 years. The last cold episode of the last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago. Over 11 major glacial events have been identified, as well as many minor glacial events. A major glacial event is a general glacial excursion, termed a &quot;glacial&quot;. Glacials are separated by &quot;interglacials&quot;. During a glacial, the glacier experiences minor advances and retreats. The minor excursion is a &quot;stadial&quot;; times between stadials are &quot;interstadials&quot;.

These events are defined differently in different regions of the glacial range, which have their own glacial history depending on latitude, terrain and climate. There is a general correspondence between glacials in different regions. Investigators often interchange the names if the glacial geology of a region is in the process of being defined. However, it is generally incorrect to apply the name of a glacial in one region to another.

For most of the 20th century, only a few regions had been studied and the names were relatively few. Today the geologists of different nations are taking more of an interest in Pleistocene glaciology. As a consequence, the number of names is expanding rapidly and will continue to expand. Many of the advances and stadials remain unnamed. Also, the terrestrial evidence for some of them has been erased or obscured by larger ones, but evidence remains from the study of cyclical climate changes.

The glacials in the following tables show &quot;historical&quot; usages, are a simplification of a much more complex cycle of variation in climate and terrain, and are generally no longer used. The headings &quot;Glacial 1&quot; to &quot;Glacial 4&quot; are designations indicating the four most recent glacials, with &quot;Glacial 4&quot; being the most recent. These names have been abandoned in favour of numeric data because many of the correlations were found to be either inexact or incorrect and more than four major glacials have been recognised since the historical terminology was established.

Corresponding to the terms glacial and interglacial, the terms pluvial and interpluvial are in use (Latin: &quot;pluvia&quot;, rain). A pluvial is a warmer period of increased rainfall; an interpluvial is of decreased rainfall. Formerly a pluvial was thought to correspond to a glacial in regions not iced, and in some cases it does. Rainfall is cyclical also. Pluvials and interpluvials are widespread.

There is no systematic correspondence between pluvials to glacials, however. Moreover, regional pluvials do not correspond to each other globally. For example, some have used the term &quot;Riss pluvial&quot; in Egyptian contexts. Any coincidence is an accident of regional factors. Only a few of the names for pluvials in restricted regions have been stratigraphically defined.

===Palaeocycles===

The sum of transient factors acting at the Earth&#x27;s surface is cyclical: climate, ocean currents and other movements, wind currents, temperature, etc. The waveform response comes from the underlying cyclical motions of the planet, which eventually drag all the transients into harmony with them. The repeated glaciations of the Pleistocene were caused by the same factors.

The Mid-Pleistocene Transition, approximately one million years ago, saw a change from low-amplitude glacial cycles with a dominant periodicity of 41,000 years to asymmetric high-amplitude cycles dominated by a periodicity of 100,000 years.

However, a 2020 study concluded that ice age terminations might have been influenced by obliquity since the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, which caused stronger summers in the Northern Hemisphere.

====Milankovitch cycles====
Glaciation in the Pleistocene was a series of glacials and interglacials, stadials and interstadials, mirroring periodic climate changes. The main factor at work in climate cycling is now believed to be Milankovitch cycles. These are periodic variations in regional and planetary solar radiation reaching the Earth caused by several repeating changes in the Earth&#x27;s motion. The effects of Milankovitch cycles were enhanced by various positive feedbacks related to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and Earth&#x27;s albedo.

Milankovitch cycles cannot be the sole factor responsible for the variations in climate since they explain neither the long-term cooling trend over the Plio-Pleistocene nor the millennial variations in the Greenland Ice Cores known as Dansgaard-Oeschger events and Heinrich events. Milankovitch pacing seems to best explain glaciation events with periodicity of 100,000, 40,000, and 20,000 years. Such a pattern seems to fit the information on climate change found in oxygen isotope cores.

====Oxygen isotope ratio cycles====
In oxygen isotope ratio analysis, variations in the ratio of to (two isotopes of oxygen) by mass (measured by a mass spectrometer) present in the calcite of oceanic core samples is used as a diagnostic of ancient ocean temperature change and therefore of climate change. Cold oceans are richer in , which is included in the tests of the microorganisms (foraminifera) contributing the calcite.

A more recent version of the sampling process makes use of modern glacial ice cores. Although less rich in than seawater, the snow that fell on the glacier year by year nevertheless contained and in a ratio that depended on the mean annual temperature.

Temperature and climate change are cyclical when plotted on a graph of temperature versus time. Temperature coordinates are given in the form of a deviation from today&#x27;s annual mean temperature, taken as zero. This sort of graph is based on another isotope ratio versus time. Ratios are converted to a percentage difference from the ratio found in standard mean ocean water (SMOW).

The graph in either form appears as a waveform with overtones. One half of a period is a Marine isotopic stage (MIS). It indicates a glacial (below zero) or an interglacial (above zero). Overtones are stadials or interstadials.

According to this evidence, Earth experienced 102 MIS stages beginning at about 2.588 Ma BP in the Early Pleistocene Gelasian. Early Pleistocene stages were shallow and frequent. The latest were the most intense and most widely spaced.

By convention, stages are numbered from the Holocene, which is MIS1. Glacials receive an even number and interglacials receive an odd number. The first major glacial was MIS2-4 at about 85–11 ka BP. The largest glacials were 2, 6, 12, and 16. The warmest interglacials were 1, 5, 9 and 11. For matching of MIS numbers to named stages, see under the articles for those names.

==Fauna==

Both marine and continental faunas were essentially modern but with many more large land mammals such as Mammoths, Mastodons, &quot;Diprotodons&quot;, &quot;Smilodons&quot;, tigers, lions, Aurochs, short-faced bears, giant sloths, species within &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; and others. Isolated landmasses such as Australia, Madagascar, New Zealand and islands in the Pacific saw the evolution of large birds and even reptiles such as the Elephant bird, moa, Haast&#x27;s eagle, &quot;Quinkana&quot;, &quot;Megalania&quot; and &quot;Meiolania&quot;.

The severe climatic changes during the Ice Age had major impacts on the fauna and flora. With each advance of the ice, large areas of the continents became depopulated, and plants and animals retreating southwards in front of the advancing glacier faced tremendous stress. The most severe stress resulted from drastic climatic changes, reduced living space, and curtailed food supply. A major extinction event of large mammals (megafauna), which included mammoths, mastodons, saber-toothed cats, &quot;glyptodons&quot;, the woolly rhinoceros, various giraffids, such as the Sivatherium; ground sloths, Irish elk, cave lions, cave bears, Gomphotheres, American lions, dire wolves, and short-faced bears, began late in the Pleistocene and continued into the Holocene. Neanderthals also became extinct during this period. At the end of the last ice age, cold-blooded animals, smaller mammals like wood mice, migratory birds, and swifter animals like whitetail deer had replaced the megafauna and migrated north. Late Pleistocene bighorn sheep were more slender and had longer legs than their descendants today. Scientists believe that the change in predator fauna after the late Pleistocene extinctions resulted in a change of body shape as the species adapted for increased power rather than speed.

The extinctions hardly affected Africa but were especially severe in North America where native horses and camels were wiped out.

* Asian land mammal ages (ALMA) include Zhoukoudianian, Nihewanian, and Yushean.
* European land mammal ages (ELMA) include the Villafranchian, Galerian, and Aurelian
*North American land mammal ages (NALMA) include Blancan (4.75–1.8), Irvingtonian (1.8–0.24) and Rancholabrean (0.24–0.01) in millions of years. The Blancan extends significantly back into the Pliocene.
* South American land mammal ages (SALMA) include Uquian (2.5–1.5), Ensenadan (1.5–0.3) and Lujanian (0.3–0.01) in millions of years. The Uquian previously extended significantly back into the Pliocene, although the new definition places it entirely within the Pleistocene.

In July 2018, a team of Russian scientists in collaboration with Princeton University announced that they had brought two female nematodes frozen in permafrost, from around 42,000 years ago, back to life. The two nematodes, at the time, were the oldest confirmed living animals on the planet.

===Humans===
The evolution of anatomically modern humans took place during the Pleistocene. At the beginning of the Pleistocene &quot;Paranthropus&quot; species were still present, as well as early human ancestors, but during the lower Palaeolithic they disappeared, and the only hominin species found in fossilic records is &quot;Homo erectus&quot; for much of the Pleistocene. Acheulean lithics appear along with &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, some 1.8 million years ago, replacing the more primitive Oldowan industry used by &quot;A. garhi&quot; and by the earliest species of &quot;Homo&quot;. The Middle Paleolithic saw more varied speciation within &quot;Homo&quot;, including the appearance of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; about 300,000 years ago. Artifacts associated with modern human behavior are unambiguously attested starting 40,000–50,000 years ago.

According to mitochondrial timing techniques, modern humans migrated from Africa after the Riss glaciation in the Middle Palaeolithic during the Eemian Stage, spreading all over the ice-free world during the late Pleistocene. A 2005 study posits that humans in this migration interbred with archaic human forms already outside of Africa by the late Pleistocene, incorporating archaic human genetic material into the modern human gene pool.

<text>In food processing, pasteurization (also pasteurisation) is a process of food preservation in which packaged foods (e.g., milk and fruit juices) are treated with mild heat, usually to less than , to eliminate pathogens and extend shelf life. Pasteurization either destroys or deactivates microorganisms and enzymes that contribute to food spoilage or the risk of disease, including vegetative bacteria, but most bacterial spores survive the process.

Pasteurization is named after the French microbiologist Louis Pasteur, whose research in the 1860s demonstrated that thermal processing would deactivate unwanted microorganisms in wine. Spoilage enzymes are also inactivated during pasteurization. Today, pasteurization is used widely in the dairy industry and other food processing industries for food preservation and food safety.

By the year 1999, most liquid products were heat treated in a continuous system where heat was applied using a heat exchanger or the direct or indirect use of hot water and steam. Due to the mild heat, there are minor changes to the nutritional quality and sensory characteristics of the treated foods. Pascalization or high-pressure processing (HPP) and pulsed electric field (PEF) are non-thermal processes that are also used to pasteurize foods.

==History==

Heating wine for preservation has been known in China since AD 1117 and was documented in Japan in the diary &quot;Tamonin-nikki&quot; written by a series of monks between 1478 and 1618.

In 1768, research performed by the Italian priest and scientist Lazzaro Spallanzani proved that a product could be made &quot;sterile&quot; after thermal processing. Spallanzani boiled meat broth for one hour sealed the container immediately after boiling, and noticed that the broth did not spoil and was free from microorganisms. In 1795, a Parisian chef and confectioner named Nicolas Appert began experimenting with ways to preserve foodstuffs, succeeding with soups, vegetables, juices, dairy products, jellies, jams, and syrups. He placed the food in glass jars, sealed them with cork and sealing wax, and placed them in boiling water. In that same year, the French military offered a cash prize of 12,000 francs for a new method to preserve food. After some 14 or 15 years of experimenting, Appert submitted his invention and won the prize in January 1810. Later that year, Appert published &quot;L&#x27;Art de conserver les substances animales et végétales&quot; (&quot;The Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable Substances&quot;). This was the first cookbook on modern food preservation methods.

&quot;La Maison Appert&quot; , in the town of Massy, near Paris, became the first food-bottling factory in the world, preserving a variety of foods in sealed bottles. Appert&#x27;s filled thick, large-mouthed glass bottles with produce of every description, ranging from beef and fowl to eggs, milk, and prepared dishes. He left air space at the top of the bottle, and the cork would then be sealed firmly in the jar by using a vise. The bottle was then wrapped in canvas to protect it while it was dunked into boiling water and then boiled for as much time as Appert deemed appropriate for cooking the contents thoroughly. Appert patented his method, sometimes called &quot;appertisation&quot; in his honor.

Appert&#x27;s method was so simple and workable that it quickly became widespread. In 1810, the British inventor and merchant Peter Durand, also of French origin, patented his method, but this time in a tin can, so creating the modern-day process of canning foods. In 1812, the Englishmen Bryan Donkin and John Hall purchased both patents and began producing preserves. A decade later, Appert&#x27;s canning method had come to America. Tin can production was not common until the beginning of the 20th century, partly because a hammer and chisel were needed to open cans until the invention of a can opener by Robert Yeates in 1855.

A less aggressive method was developed by French chemist Louis Pasteur during an 1864 summer holiday in Arbois. To remedy the frequent acidity of the local aged wines, he found out experimentally that it is sufficient to heat a young wine to only about for a short time to kill the microbes, and that the wine could subsequently be aged without sacrificing the final quality. In honor of Pasteur, this process is known as pasteurization. Pasteurization was originally used as a way of preventing wine and beer from souring, and it would be many years before milk was pasteurized. In the United States in the 1870s, before milk was regulated, it was common for milk to contain substances intended to mask spoilage.

===Milk===

Milk is an excellent medium for microbial growth, and when it is stored at ambient temperature, bacteria and other pathogens soon proliferate. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says improperly handled raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other food-borne disease source, making it one of the world&#x27;s most dangerous food products. Diseases prevented by pasteurization include tuberculosis, brucellosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and Q-fever; it also kills the harmful bacteria &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Listeria&quot;, &quot;Yersinia&quot;, &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and &quot;Escherichia coli O157:H7&quot;, among others.

Before industrialization, dairy cows were kept in urban areas to limit the time between milk production and consumption, hence the risk of disease transmission via raw milk was reduced. As urban densities increased and supply chains lengthened to the distance from country to city, raw milk (often days old) became recognized as a source of disease. For example, between 1912 and 1937, some 65,000 people died of tuberculosis contracted from consuming milk in England and Wales alone. Because tuberculosis has a long incubation period in humans, it was difficult to link unpasteurized milk consumption with the disease. In 1892, chemist Ernst Lederle experimentally inoculated milk from tuberculosis-diseased cows into guinea pigs, which caused them to develop the disease. In 1910, Lederle, then in the role of Commissioner of Health, introduced mandatory pasteurization of milk in New York City.

Developed countries adopted milk pasteurization to prevent such disease and loss of life, and as a result, milk is now considered a safer food. A traditional form of pasteurization by scalding and straining of cream to increase the keeping qualities of butter was practiced in Great Britain in the 18th century and was introduced to Boston in the British Colonies by 1773, although it was not widely practiced in the United States for the next 20 years. Pasteurization of milk was suggested by Franz von Soxhlet in 1886. In the early 20th century, Milton Joseph Rosenau established the standards – i.e. low-temperature, slow heating at for 20 minutes – for the pasteurization of milk while at the United States Marine Hospital Service, notably in his publication of &quot;The Milk Question&quot; (1912). States in the U.S. soon began enacting mandatory dairy pasteurization laws, with the first in 1947, and in 1973 the U.S. federal government required pasteurization of milk used in any interstate commerce.

The shelf life of refrigerated pasteurized milk is greater than that of raw milk. For example, high-temperature, short-time (HTST) pasteurized milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks, whereas ultra-pasteurized milk can last much longer, sometimes two to three months. When ultra-heat treatment (UHT) is combined with sterile handling and container technology (such as aseptic packaging), it can even be stored non-refrigerated for up to 9 months.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, between 1998 and 2011, 79% of dairy-related disease outbreaks in the United States were due to raw milk or cheese products. They report 148 outbreaks and 2,384 illnesses (with 284 requiring hospitalization), as well as two deaths due to raw milk or cheese products during the same period.

===Medical equipment===

Medical equipment, notably respiratory and anesthesia equipment, is often disinfected using hot water, as an alternative to chemical disinfection. The temperature is raised to for 30 minutes. More thorough sterilization can be performed at higher temperatures and pressures in an autoclave.

==Pasteurization process==
Pasteurization is a mild heat treatment of liquid foods (both packaged and unpackaged) where products are typically heated to below . The heat treatment and cooling process are designed to inhibit a phase change in the product. The acidity of the food determines the parameters (time and temperature) of the heat treatment as well as the duration of shelf life. Parameters also take into account nutritional and sensory qualities that are sensitive to heat.

In acidic foods (with pH of 4.6 or less), such as fruit juice and beer, the heat treatments are designed to inactivate enzymes (pectin methylesterase and polygalacturonase in fruit juices) and destroy spoilage microbes (yeast and lactobacillus). Due to the low pH of acidic foods, pathogens cannot grow. The shelf-life is thereby extended by several weeks. In less acidic foods (with pH greater than 4.6), such as milk and liquid eggs, heat treatments are designed to destroy pathogens and spoilage organisms (yeast and molds). Not all spoilage organisms are destroyed under pasteurization parameters, so subsequent refrigeration is necessary.

High-temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurization, such as that used for milk ( for 15 seconds) ensures the safety of milk and provides a refrigerated shelf life of approximately two weeks. In ultra-high-temperature (UHT) pasteurization, milk is pasteurized at for 1–2 seconds, which provides the same level of safety, but along with the packaging, extends shelf life to three months under refrigeration.

===Equipment===

Food can be pasteurized either before or after being packaged into containers. Pasteurization of food in containers generally uses either steam or hot water. When food is packaged in glass, hot water is used to avoid cracking the glass from thermal shock. When plastic or metal packaging is used, the risk of thermal shock is low, so steam or hot water is used.

Most liquid foods are pasteurized by using a continuous process that passes the food through a heating zone, a hold tube to keep it at the pasteurization temperature for the desired time, and a cooling zone, after which the product is filled into the package. Plate heat exchangers are often used for low-viscosity products such as animal milk, nut milk, and juices. A plate heat exchanger is composed of many thin vertical stainless steel plates that separate the liquid from the heating or cooling medium. 

Shell and tube heat exchangers are often used for the pasteurization of foods that are non-Newtonian fluids, such as dairy products, tomato ketchup, and baby foods. A tube heat exchanger is made up of concentric stainless steel tubes. Food passes through the inner tube or tubes, while the heating/cooling medium is circulated through the outer tube.

Scraped-surface heat exchangers are a type of shell and tube that contain an inner rotating shaft having spring-loaded blades that serve to scrape away any highly viscous material that accumulates on the wall of the tube.

The benefits of using a heat exchanger to pasteurize foods before packaging, versus pasteurizing foods in containers are:
* Higher uniformity of treatment
* Greater flexibility with regard to the products that can be pasteurized
* Higher heat transfer-efficiency
* Greater throughput

After being heated in a heat exchanger, the product flows through a hold tube for a set period to achieve the required treatment. If pasteurization temperature or time is not achieved, a flow diversion valve is used to divert the under-processed product back to the raw product tank. If the product is adequately processed, it is cooled in a heat exchanger, then filled.

===Verification===

Direct microbiological techniques are the ultimate measurement of pathogen contamination, but these are costly and time-consuming, which means that products have a reduced shelf-life by the time pasteurization is verified.

As a result of the unsuitability of microbiological techniques, milk pasteurization efficacy is typically monitored by checking for the presence of alkaline phosphatase, which is denatured by pasteurization. Destruction of alkaline phosphatase ensures the destruction of common milk pathogens. Therefore, the presence of alkaline phosphatase is an ideal indicator of pasteurization efficacy. For liquid eggs, the effectiveness of the heat treatment is measured by the residual activity of α-amylase.

====Efficacy against pathogenic bacteria====

During the early 20th century, there was no robust knowledge of what time and temperature combinations would inactivate pathogenic bacteria in milk, so several different pasteurization standards were in use. By 1943, both HTST pasteurization conditions of for 15 seconds, as well as batch pasteurization conditions of for 30 minutes, were confirmed by studies of the complete thermal death (as best as could be measured at that time) for a range of pathogenic bacteria in milk. Complete inactivation of &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot; (which was thought at the time to cause Q fever by oral ingestion of infected milk) as well as of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; (which causes tuberculosis) were later demonstrated. For all practical purposes, these conditions were adequate for destroying almost all yeasts, molds, and common spoilage bacteria and also for ensuring adequate destruction of common pathogenic, heat-resistant organisms. However, the microbiological techniques used until the 1960s did not allow for the actual reduction of bacteria to be enumerated. Demonstration of the extent of inactivation of pathogenic bacteria by milk pasteurization came from a study of surviving bacteria in milk that was heat-treated after being deliberately spiked with high levels of the most heat-resistant strains of the most significant milk-borne pathogens.

The mean log10 reductions and temperatures of inactivation of the major milk-borne pathogens during a 15-second treatment are:
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; &gt; 6.7 at 
* &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot; &gt; 6.8 at 
* Pathogenic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; &gt; 6.8 at 
* &quot;Cronobacter sakazakii&quot; &gt; 6.7 at 
* &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; &gt; 6.9 at 
* Salmonella ser. Typhimurium &gt; 6.9 at 
(A log10 reduction between 6 and 7 means that 1 bacterium out of 1 million (106) to 10 million (107) bacteria survive the treatment.)

The Codex Alimentarius &quot;Code of Hygienic Practice for Milk&quot; notes that milk pasteurization is designed to achieve at least a 5 log10 reduction of &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot;. The Code also notes that: &quot;The minimum pasteurization conditions are those having bactericidal effects equivalent to heating every particle of the milk to for 15 seconds (continuous flow pasteurization) or for 30 minutes (batch pasteurization)” and that &quot;To ensure that each particle is sufficiently heated, the milk flow in heat exchangers should be turbulent, &quot;i.e&quot;. the Reynolds number should be sufficiently high&quot;. The point about turbulent flow is important because simplistic laboratory studies of heat inactivation that use test tubes, without flow, will have less bacterial inactivation than larger-scale experiments that seek to replicate conditions of commercial pasteurization.

As a precaution, modern HTST pasteurization processes must be designed with flow-rate restriction as well as divert valves which ensure that the milk is heated evenly and that no part of the milk is subject to a shorter time or a lower temperature. It is common for the temperatures to exceed by .

=== Double pasteurization ===
Pasteurization is not sterilization and does not kill spores. &quot;Double&quot; pasteurization, which involves a secondary heating process, can extend shelf life by killing spores that have germinated.

The acceptance of double pasteurization varies by jurisdiction. In places where it is allowed, milk is initially pasteurized when it is collected from the farm so it does not spoil before processing. Many countries prohibit the labelling of such milk as &quot;pasteurized&quot; but allow it to be marked &quot;thermized&quot;, which refers to a lower-temperature process.

==Effects on nutritional and sensory characteristics of foods==

Because of its mild heat treatment, pasteurization increases the shelf-life by a few days or weeks. However, this mild heat also means there are only minor changes to heat-labile vitamins in the foods.

===Milk===
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis, it was found that pasteurization appeared to reduce concentrations of vitamins B12 and E, but it also increased concentrations of vitamin A. However, in the review, there was only limited research regarding how much pasteurization affects A, B12, and E levels. Milk is not considered an important source of vitamins B12 or E in the North American diet, so the effects of pasteurization on the adult daily intake of these vitamins is negligible. However, milk is considered an important source of vitamin A, and because pasteurization appears to increase vitamin A concentrations in milk, the effect of milk heat treatment on this vitamin is a not a major public health concern. Results of meta-analyses reveal that pasteurization of milk leads to a significant decrease in vitamin C and folate, but milk is also not an important source of these vitamins. A significant decrease in vitamin B2 concentrations was found after pasteurization. Vitamin B2 is typically found in bovine milk at concentrations of 1.83 mg/liter. Because the recommended daily intake for adults is 1.1 mg/day, milk consumption greatly contributes to the recommended daily intake of this vitamin. Except for B2, pasteurization does not appear to be a concern in diminishing the nutritive value of milk because milk is often not a primary source of these studied vitamins in the North American diet.

===Sensory effects===

Pasteurization also has a small but measurable effect on the sensory attributes of the foods that are processed. In fruit juices, pasteurization may result in loss of volatile aroma compounds. Fruit juice products undergo a deaeration process before pasteurization that may be responsible for this loss. Deaeration also minimizes the loss of nutrients like vitamin C and carotene. To prevent the decrease in quality resulting from the loss in volatile compounds, volatile recovery, though costly, can be utilized to produce higher-quality juice products.

Regarding color, the pasteurization process does not have much effect on pigments such as chlorophylls, anthocyanins, and carotenoids in plants and animal tissues. In fruit juices, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is the main enzyme responsible for causing browning and color changes. However, this enzyme is deactivated in the deaeration step before pasteurization with the removal of oxygen.

In milk, the color difference between pasteurized and raw milk is related to the homogenization step that takes place before pasteurization. Before pasteurization milk is homogenized to emulsify its fat and water-soluble components, which results in the pasteurized milk having a whiter appearance compared to raw milk. For vegetable products, color degradation is dependent on the temperature conditions and the duration of heating.

Pasteurization may result in some textural loss as a result of enzymatic and non-enzymatic transformations in the structure of pectin if the processing temperatures are too high as a result. However, with mild heat treatment pasteurization, tissue softening in the vegetables that causes textural loss is not of concern as long as the temperature does not get above .

==Novel pasteurization methods==

&quot;Pasteurizing&quot; in the broad sense refers to any method that reduces microbes by an amount (log reduction) equivalent to Pasteur&#x27;s process. Novel processes, thermal and non-thermal, have been developed to pasteurize foods as a way of reducing the effects on nutritional and sensory characteristics of foods and preventing the degradation of heat-labile nutrients. Pascalization or high pressure processing (HPP), pulsed electric field (PEF), ionising radiation, high pressure homogenisation, UV decontamination, pulsed high intensity light, high intensity laser, pulsed white light, high power ultrasound, oscillating magnetic fields, high voltage arc discharge, and streamer plasma are examples of these non-thermal pasteurization methods that are currently commercially utilized.

Microwave volumetric heating (MVH) is the newest available pasteurization technology. It uses microwaves to heat liquids, suspensions, or semi-solids in a continuous flow. Because MVH delivers energy evenly and deeply into the whole body of a flowing product, it allows for gentler and shorter heating, so that almost all heat-sensitive substances in the milk are preserved.

<text>Penicillins (P, PCN or PEN) are a group of β-lactam antibiotics originally obtained from &quot;Penicillium&quot; moulds, principally &quot;P. chrysogenum&quot; and &quot;P. rubens&quot;. Most penicillins in clinical use are synthesised by &quot;P. chrysogenum&quot; using deep tank fermentation and then purified. A number of natural penicillins have been discovered, but only two purified compounds are in clinical use: penicillin G (intramuscular or intravenous use) and penicillin V (given by mouth). Penicillins were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci. They are still widely used today for various bacterial infections, though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use.
Ten percent of the population claims penicillin allergies, but because the frequency of positive skin test results decreases by 10% with each year of avoidance, 90% of these patients can eventually tolerate penicillin. Additionally, those with penicillin allergies can usually tolerate cephalosporins (another group of β-lactam) because the immunoglobulin E (IgE) cross-reactivity is only 3%.
Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming as a crude extract of &quot;P. rubens&quot;. Fleming&#x27;s student Cecil George Paine was the first to successfully use penicillin to treat eye infection (neonatal conjunctivitis) in 1930. The purified compound (penicillin F) was isolated in 1940 by a research team led by Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain at the University of Oxford. Fleming first used the purified penicillin to treat streptococcal meningitis in 1942. The 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was shared by Chain, Fleming, and Florey.

Several semisynthetic penicillins are effective against a broader spectrum of bacteria: these include the antistaphylococcal penicillins, aminopenicillins, and antipseudomonal penicillins.

== Nomenclature ==
The term &quot;penicillin&quot; is defined as the natural product of &quot;Penicillium&quot; mould with antimicrobial activity. It was coined by Alexander Fleming on 7 March 1929 when he discovered the antibacterial property of &quot;Penicillium rubens&quot;. Fleming explained in his 1929 paper in the &quot;British Journal of Experimental Pathology&quot; that &quot;to avoid the repetition of the rather cumbersome phrase &#x27;Mould broth filtrate&#x27;, the name &#x27;penicillin&#x27; will be used.&quot; The name thus refers to the scientific name of the mould, as described by Fleming in his Nobel lecture in 1945:

I have been frequently asked why I invented the name &quot;Penicillin&quot;. I simply followed perfectly orthodox lines and coined a word which explained that the substance penicillin was derived from a plant of the genus Penicillium just as many years ago the word &quot;Digitalin&quot; was invented for a substance derived from the plant &quot;Digitalis&quot;.

In modern usage, the term penicillin is used more broadly to refer to any β-lactam antimicrobial that contains a thiazolidine ring fused to the β-lactam core and may or may not be a natural product. Like most natural products, penicillin is present in &quot;Penicillium&quot; moulds as a mixture of active constituents (gentamicin is another example of a natural product that is an ill-defined mixture of active components). The principal active components of &quot;Penicillium&quot; are listed in the following table:&quot;

Other minor active components of &quot;Penicillium&quot; include penicillin O, penicillin U1, and penicillin U6. Other named constituents of natural &quot;Penicillium&quot;, such as penicillin A, were subsequently found not to have antibiotic activity and are not chemically related to antibiotic penicillins.

The precise constitution of the penicillin extracted depends on the species of &quot;Penicillium&quot; mould used and on the nutrient media used to culture the mould. Fleming&#x27;s original strain of &quot;Penicillium rubens&quot; produces principally penicillin F, named after Fleming. But penicillin F is unstable, difficult to isolate, and produced by the mould in small quantities.

The principal commercial strain of &quot;Penicillium chrysogenum&quot; (the Peoria strain) produces penicillin G as the principal component when corn steep liquor is used as the culture medium. When phenoxyethanol or phenoxyacetic acid are added to the culture medium, the mould produces penicillin V as the main penicillin instead.

6-Aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) is a compound derived from penicillin G. 6-APA contains the beta-lactam core of penicillin G, but with the side chains stripped off; 6-APA is a useful precursor for manufacturing other penicillins. There are many semi-synthetic penicillins derived from 6-APA and these are in three groups: antistaphylococcal penicillins, broad-spectrum penicillins, and antipseudomonal penicillins. The semi-synthetic penicillins are all referred to as penicillins because they are all derived ultimately from penicillin G.

=== Penicillin units ===
* One unit of penicillin G sodium is defined as 0.600 micrograms. Therefore, 2 million units (2 megaunits) of penicillin G is 1.2 g.
* One unit of penicillin V potassium is defined as 0.625 micrograms. Therefore 400,000 units of penicillin V is 250 mg.

The use of units to prescribe penicillin is a historical accident and is largely obsolete outside of the US. Since the original penicillin was an ill-defined mixture of active compounds (an amorphous yellow powder), the potency of each batch of penicillin varied from batch to batch. It was therefore impossible to prescribe 1 g of penicillin because the activity of 1 g of penicillin from one batch would be different from the activity from another batch. After manufacture, each batch of penicillin had to be standardised against a known unit of penicillin: each glass vial was then filled with the number of units required. In the 1940s, a vial of 5,000 Oxford units was standard, but the depending on the batch, could contain anything from 15 mg to 20 mg of penicillin. Later, a vial of 1,000,000 international units became standard, and this could contain 2.5 g to 3 g of natural penicillin (a mixture of penicillin I, II, III, and IV and natural impurities). With the advent of pure penicillin G preparations (a white crystalline powder), there is little reason to prescribe penicillin in units.

The &quot;unit&quot; of penicillin has had three previous definitions, and each definition was chosen as being roughly equivalent to the previous one.
* Oxford or Florey unit (1941). This was originally defined as the minimum amount of penicillin dissolved in 50 ml of meat extract that would inhibit the growth of a standard strain of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (the Oxford Staphylococcus). The reference standard was a large batch of impure penicillin kept in Oxford. The assay was later modified by Florey&#x27;s group to a more reproducible &quot;cup assay&quot;: in this assay, a penicillin solution was defined to contain one unit/ml of penicillin when 339 microlitres of the solution placed in a &quot;cup&quot; on a plate of solid agar produced a 24 millimetre zone of inhibition of growth of Oxford Staphylococcus.
* First International Standard (1944). A single 8 gram batch of pure crystalline penicillin G sodium was stored at The National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill in London (the International Standard). One penicillin unit was defined at 0.6 micrograms of the International Standard. An impure &quot;working standard&quot; was also defined and was available in much larger quantities distributed around the world: one unit of the working standard was 2.7 micrograms (the amount per unit was much larger because of the impurities). At the same time, the cup assay was refined, where instead of specifying a zone diameter of 24 mm, the zone size were instead plotted against a reference curve to provide a readout on potency.
* Second International Standard (1953). A single 30 gram batch of pure crystalline penicillin G sodium was obtained: this was also stored at Mill Hill. One penicillin unit was defined as 0.5988 micrograms of the Second International Standard.

There is an older unit for penicillin V that is not equivalent to the current penicillin V unit. The reason is that the US FDA incorrectly assumed that the potency of penicillin V is the same mole-for-mole as penicillin G. In fact, penicillin V is less potent than penicillin G, and the current penicillin V unit reflects that fact.
* First international unit of penicillin V (1959). One unit of penicillin V was defined as 0.590 micrograms of a reference standard held at Mill Hill in London. This unit is now obsolete.

A similar standard was also established for penicillin K.

== Types ==
Penicillins consist of a distinct 4-membered beta-lactam ring, in addition to a thiazolide ring and an R side chain. The main distinguishing feature between variants within this family is the &quot;R substituent&quot;. 

This side chain is connected to the 6-aminopenicillanic acid residue and results in &quot;variations&quot; in the antimicrobial spectrum, stability, and susceptibility to beta-lactamases of each type.
=== Natural penicillins ===
Penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) was first produced from a penicillium fungus that occurs in nature. The strain of fungus used today for the manufacture of penicillin G was created by genetic engineering to improve the yield in the manufacturing process. None of the other natural penicillins (F, K, N, X, O, U1 or U6) are currently in clinical use.

===Semi-synthetic penicillin===

Penicillin V (phenoxymethylpenicillin) is produced by adding the precursor phenoxyacetic acid to the medium in which a genetically modified strain of the penicillium fungus is being cultured.

=== Antibiotics created from 6-APA ===
There are three major groups of other semi-synthetic antibiotics related to the penicillins. They are synthesised by adding various side-chains to the precursor 6-APA, which is isolated from penicillin G. These are the antistaphylococcal antibiotics, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and antipseudomonal antibiotics.

====Antistaphylococcal antibiotics====
* Cloxacillin (by mouth or by injection)
* Dicloxacillin (by mouth or by injection)
* Flucloxacillin (by mouth or by injection)
* Methicillin (injection only)
* Nafcillin (injection only)
* Oxacillin (by mouth or by injection)
Antistaphylococcal antibiotics are so-called because they are resistant to being broken down by staphylococcal penicillinase. They are also, therefore, referred to as being penicillinase-resistant.

====Broad-spectrum antibiotics====
This group of antibiotics is called &quot;broad-spectrum&quot; because they are active against a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot;, for which penicillin is not suitable. However, resistance in these organisms is now common.
* Ampicillin
* Amoxicillin

There are many ampicillin precursors in existence. These are inactive compounds that are broken down in the gut to release ampicillin. None of these pro-drugs of ampicillin are in current use:
* Pivampicillin (pivaloyloxymethyl ester of ampicillin)
* Bacampicillin
* Metampicillin (formaldehyde ester of ampicillin)
* Talampicillin
* Hetacillin (ampicillin conjugated to acetone)

Epicillin is an aminopenicillin that has never seen widespread clinical use.

====Antipseudomonal antibiotics====
The Gram-negative species, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa,&quot; is naturally resistant to many antibiotic classes. There were many efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to develop antibiotics that are active against &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species. There are two chemical classes within the group: carboxypenicillins and ureidopenicillins. All are given by injection: none can be given by mouth.

===== Carboxypenicillins =====
* Carbenicillin
* Ticarcillin
* Temocillin

===== Ureidopenicillins =====
* Mezlocillin
* Piperacillin
* Azlocillin

=== β-lactamase inhibitors ===
* Clavulanic acid
* Sulbactam
* Tazobactam

==Medical usage==
The term &quot;penicillin&quot;, when used by itself, may refer to either of two chemical compounds, penicillin G or penicillin V.
=== Penicillin G ===
Penicillin G is destroyed by stomach acid, so it cannot be taken by mouth, but doses as high as 2.4 g can be given (much higher than penicillin V). It is given by intravenous or intramuscular injection. It can be formulated as an insoluble salt, and there are two such formulations in current use: procaine penicillin and benzathine benzylpenicillin. When a high concentration in the blood must be maintained, penicillin G must be administered at relatively frequent intervals, because it is eliminated quite rapidly from the bloodstream by the kidney.

Penicillin G is licensed for use to treat septicaemia, empyema, pneumonia, pericarditis, endocarditis and meningitis caused by susceptible strains of staphylococci and streptococci. It is also licensed for the treatment of anthrax, actinomycosis, cervicofacial disease, thoracic and abdominal disease, clostridial infections, botulism, gas gangrene (with accompanying debridement and/or surgery as indicated), tetanus (as an adjunctive therapy to human tetanus immune globulin), diphtheria (as an adjunctive therapy to antitoxin and for the prevention of the carrier state), erysipelothrix endocarditis, fusospirochetosis (severe infections of the oropharynx, lower respiratory tract and genital area), &quot;Listeria&quot; infections, meningitis, endocarditis, &quot;Pasteurella&quot; infections including bacteraemia and meningitis, Haverhill fever; rat-bite fever and disseminated gonococcal infections, meningococcal meningitis and/or septicaemia caused by penicillin-susceptible organisms and syphilis.

=== Penicillin V ===
Penicillin V can be taken by mouth because it is relatively resistant to stomach acid. Doses higher than 500 mg are not fully effective because of poor absorption. It is used for the same bacterial infections as those of penicillin G and is the most widely used form of penicillin. However, it is not used for diseases, such as endocarditis, where high blood levels of penicillin are required.

===Bacterial susceptibility===

Because penicillin resistance is now so common, other antibiotics are now the preferred choice for treatments. For example, penicillin used to be the first-line treatment for infections with &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; and &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;, but it is no longer recommended for treatment of these infections. Penicillin resistance is now very common in &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, which means penicillin should not be used to treat infections caused by &quot;S. aureus&quot; infection unless the infecting strain is known to be susceptible.

== Side effects ==

Common (≥ 1% of people) adverse drug reactions associated with use of the penicillins include diarrhoea, hypersensitivity, nausea, rash, neurotoxicity, urticaria, and superinfection (including candidiasis). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of people) include fever, vomiting, erythema, dermatitis, angioedema, seizures (especially in people with epilepsy), and pseudomembranous colitis. Penicillin can also induce serum sickness or a serum sickness-like reaction in some individuals. Serum sickness is a type III hypersensitivity reaction that occurs one to three weeks after exposure to drugs including penicillin. It is not a true drug allergy, because allergies are type I hypersensitivity reactions, but repeated exposure to the offending agent can result in an anaphylactic reaction. Allergy will occur in 1–10% of people, presenting as a skin rash after exposure. IgE-mediated anaphylaxis will occur in approximately 0.01% of patients.

Pain and inflammation at the injection site are also common for parenterally administered benzathine benzylpenicillin, benzylpenicillin, and, to a lesser extent, procaine benzylpenicillin. The condition is known as livedoid dermatitis or Nicolau syndrome.

== Structure ==
The term &quot;penam&quot; is used to describe the common core skeleton of a member of the penicillins. This core has the molecular formula R-C9H11N2O4S, where R is the variable side chain that differentiates the penicillins from one another. The penam core has a molar mass of 243 g/mol, with larger penicillins having molar mass near 450—for example, cloxacillin has a molar mass of 436 g/mol. 6-APA (C8H12N2O3S) forms the basic structure of penicillins. It is made up of an enclosed dipeptide formed by the condensation of and . This results in the formations of β-lactam and thiazolidinic rings.

The key structural feature of the penicillins is the four-membered β-lactam ring; this structural moiety is essential for penicillin&#x27;s antibacterial activity. The β-lactam ring is itself fused to a five-membered thiazolidine ring. The fusion of these two rings causes the β-lactam ring to be more reactive than monocyclic β-lactams because the two fused rings distort the β-lactam amide bond and therefore remove the resonance stabilisation normally found in these chemical bonds. An acyl side side chain attached to the β-lactam ring.

A variety of β-lactam antibiotics have been produced following chemical modification from the 6-APA structure during synthesis, specifically by making chemical substitutions in the acyl side chain. For example, the first chemically altered penicillin, methicillin, had substitutions by methoxy groups at positions 2’ and 6’ of the 6-APA benzene ring from penicillin G. This difference makes methicillin resistant to the activity of β-lactamase, an enzyme by which many bacteria are naturally unsusceptible to penicillins.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Entry into bacteria ===
Penicillin can easily enter bacterial cells in the case of Gram-positive species. This is because Gram-positive bacteria do not have an outer cell membrane and are simply enclosed in a thick cell wall. Penicillin molecules are small enough to pass through the spaces of glycoproteins in the cell wall. For this reason Gram-positive bacteria are very susceptible to penicillin (as first evidenced by the discovery of penicillin in 1928).

Penicillin, or any other molecule, enters Gram-negative bacteria in a different manner. The bacteria have thinner cell walls but the external surface is coated with an additional cell membrane, called the outer membrane. The outer membrane is a lipid layer (lipopolysaccharide chain) that blocks passage of water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules like penicillin. It thus acts as the first line of defence against any toxic substance, which is the reason for relative resistance to antibiotics compared to Gram-positive species. But penicillin can still enter Gram-negative species by diffusing through aqueous channels called porins (outer membrane proteins), which are dispersed among the fatty molecules and can transport nutrients and antibiotics into the bacteria. Porins are large enough to allow diffusion of most penicillins, but the rate of diffusion through them is determined by the specific size of the drug molecules. For instance, penicillin G is large and enters through porins slowly; while smaller ampicillin and amoxicillin diffuse much faster. In contrast, large vancomycin can not pass through porins and is thus ineffective for Gram-negative bacteria. The size and number of porins are different in different bacteria. As a result of the two factors—size of penicillin and porin—Gram-negative bacteria can be unsusceptible or have varying degree of susceptibility to specific penicillin.

=== Mechanism of action ===


Penicillin kills bacteria by inhibiting the completion of the synthesis of peptidoglycans, the structural component of the bacterial cell wall. It specifically inhibits the activity of enzymes that are needed for the cross-linking of peptidoglycans during the final step in cell wall biosynthesis. It does this by binding to penicillin binding proteins with the β-lactam ring, a structure found on penicillin molecules. This causes the cell wall to weaken due to fewer cross-links and means water uncontrollably flows into the cell because it cannot maintain the correct osmotic gradient. This results in cell lysis and death.

Bacteria constantly remodel their peptidoglycan cell walls, simultaneously building and breaking down portions of the cell wall as they grow and divide. During the last stages of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, uridine diphosphate-&quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid pentapeptide (UDP-MurNAc) is formed in which the fourth and fifth amino acids are both -alanyl--alanine. The transfer of -alanine is done (catalysed) by the enzyme -transpeptidase (penicillin-binding proteins are such type). The structural integrity of bacterial cell wall depends on the cross linking of UDP-MurNAc and &quot;N&quot;-acetyl glucosamine. Penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics act as an analogue of -alanine--alanine (the dipeptide) in UDP-MurNAc owing to conformational similarities. The -transpeptidase then binds the four-membered β-lactam ring of penicillin instead of UDP-MurNAc. As a consequence, -transpeptidase is inactivated, the formation of cross-links between UDP-MurNAc and &quot;N&quot;-acetyl glucosamine is blocked so that an imbalance between cell wall production and degradation develops, causing the cell to rapidly die.

The enzymes that hydrolyze the peptidoglycan cross-links continue to function, even while those that form such cross-links do not. This weakens the cell wall of the bacterium, and osmotic pressure becomes increasingly uncompensated—eventually causing cell death (cytolysis). In addition, the build-up of peptidoglycan precursors triggers the activation of bacterial cell wall hydrolases and autolysins, which further digest the cell wall&#x27;s peptidoglycans. The small size of the penicillins increases their potency, by allowing them to penetrate the entire depth of the cell wall. This is in contrast to the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin, which are both much larger than the penicillins.

Gram-positive bacteria are called protoplasts when they lose their cell walls. Gram-negative bacteria do not lose their cell walls completely and are called spheroplasts after treatment with penicillin.

Penicillin shows a synergistic effect with aminoglycosides, since the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis allows aminoglycosides to penetrate the bacterial cell wall more easily, allowing their disruption of bacterial protein synthesis within the cell. This results in a lowered MBC for susceptible organisms.

Penicillins, like other &quot;β&quot;-lactam antibiotics, block not only the division of bacteria, including cyanobacteria, but also the division of cyanelles, the photosynthetic organelles of the glaucophytes, and the division of chloroplasts of bryophytes. In contrast, they have no effect on the plastids of the highly developed vascular plants. This supports the endosymbiotic theory of the evolution of plastid division in land plants.

Some bacteria produce enzymes that break down the β-lactam ring, called β-lactamases, which make the bacteria resistant to penicillin. Therefore, some penicillins are modified or given with other drugs for use against antibiotic-resistant bacteria or in immunocompromised patients. The use of clavulanic acid or tazobactam, β-lactamase inhibitors, alongside penicillin gives penicillin activity against β-lactamase-producing bacteria. β-Lactamase inhibitors irreversibly bind to β-lactamase preventing it from breaking down the beta-lactam rings on the antibiotic molecule. Alternatively, flucloxacillin is a modified penicillin that has activity against β-lactamase-producing bacteria due to an acyl side chain that protects the beta-lactam ring from β-lactamase.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Penicillin has low protein binding in plasma. The bioavailability of penicillin depends on the type: penicillin G has low bioavailability, below 30%, whereas penicillin V has higher bioavailability, between 60 and 70%.

Penicillin has a short half-life and is excreted via the kidneys. This means it must be dosed at least four times a day to maintain adequate levels of penicillin in the blood. Early manuals on the use of penicillin, therefore, recommended injections of penicillin as frequently as every three hours, and dosing penicillin has been described as being similar to trying to fill a bath with the plug out. This is no longer required since much larger doses of penicillin are cheaply and easily available; however, some authorities recommend the use of continuous penicillin infusions for this reason.

== Resistance ==
When Alexander Fleming discovered the crude penicillin in 1928, one important observation he made was that many bacteria were not affected by penicillin. This phenomenon was realised by Ernst Chain and Edward Abraham while trying to identify the exact of penicillin. In 1940, they discovered that unsusceptible bacteria like &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; produced specific enzymes that can break down penicillin molecules, thus making them resistant to the antibiotic. They named the enzyme penicillinase. Penicillinase is now classified as member of enzymes called β-lactamases. These β-lactamases are naturally present in many other bacteria, and many bacteria produce them upon constant exposure to antibiotics. In most bacteria, resistance can be through three different mechanisms – reduced permeability in bacteria, reduced binding affinity of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) or destruction of the antibiotic through the expression of β-lactamase. Using any of these, bacteria commonly develop resistance to different antibiotics, a phenomenon called multi-drug resistance.

The actual process of resistance mechanism can be very complex. In case of reduced permeability in bacteria, the mechanisms are different between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In Gram-positive bacteria, blockage of penicillin is due to changes in the cell wall. For example, resistance to vancomycin in &quot;S. aureus&quot; is due to additional peptidoglycan synthesis that makes the cell wall much thicker preventing effective penicillin entry. Resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is due to mutational variations in the structure and number of porins. In bacteria like &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, there is reduced number of porins; whereas in bacteria like &quot;Enterobacter&quot; species, &quot;Escherichia&quot; &quot;coli&quot; and &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, there are modified porins such as non-specific porins (such as OmpC and OmpF groups) that cannot transport penicillin.

Resistance due to PBP alterations is highly varied. A common case is found in &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; where there is mutation in the gene for PBP, and the mutant PBPs have decreased binding affinity for penicillins. There are six mutant PBPs in &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;, of which PBP1a, PBP2b, PBP2x and sometimes PBP2a are responsible for reduced binding affinity. &quot;S. aureus&quot; can activate a hidden gene that produces a different PBP, PBD2, which has low binding affinity for penicillins. There is a different strain of &quot;S. aureus&quot; named methicillin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; (MRSA) which is resistant not only to penicillin and other β-lactams, but also to most antibiotics. The bacterial strain developed after introduction of methicillin in 1959. In MRSA, mutations in the genes (&quot;mec&quot; system) for PBP produce a variant protein called PBP2a (also termed PBP2&#x27;), while making four normal PBPs. PBP2a has poor binding affinity for penicillin and also lacks glycosyltransferase activity required for complete peptidoglycan synthesis (which is carried out by the four normal PBPs). In &quot;Helicobacter cinaedi&quot;, there are multiple mutations in different genes that make PBP variants.

Enzymatic destruction by β-lactamases is the most important mechanism of penicillin resistance, and is described as &quot;the greatest threat to the usage [of penicillins]&quot;. It was the first discovered mechanism of penicillin resistance. During the experiments when purification and biological activity tests of penicillin were performed in 1940, it was found that &quot;E. coli&quot; was unsusceptible. The reason was discovered as production of an enzyme penicillinase (hence, the first β-lactamase known) in &quot;E. coli&quot; that easily degraded penicillin. There are over 2,000 types of β-lactamases each of which has unique amino acid sequence, and thus, enzymatic activity. All of them are able to hydrolyse β-lactam rings but their exact target sites are different. They are secreted on the bacterial surface in large quantities in Gram-positive bacteria but less so in Gram-negative species. Therefore, in a mixed bacterial infection, the Gram-positive bacteria can protect the otherwise penicillin-susceptible Gram-negative cells.

There are unusual mechanisms in &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot;, in which there can be biofilm-mediated resistance and formation of multidrug-tolerant persister cells.

== History ==
=== Discovery ===

Starting in the late 19th century there had been reports of the antibacterial properties of &quot;Penicillium&quot; mould, but scientists were unable to discern what process was causing the effect. Scottish physician Alexander Fleming at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in London (now part of Imperial College) was the first to show that &quot;Penicillium rubens&quot; had antibacterial properties. On 3 September 1928 he observed by chance that fungal contamination of a bacterial culture (&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;) appeared to kill the bacteria. He confirmed this observation with a new experiment on 28 September 1928. He published his experiment in 1929, and called the antibacterial substance (the fungal extract) penicillin.

C. J. La Touche identified the fungus as &quot;Penicillium rubrum&quot; (later reclassified by Charles Thom as &quot;P. notatum&quot; and &quot;P. chrysogenum&quot;, but later corrected as &quot;P. rubens&quot;). Fleming expressed initial optimism that penicillin would be a useful antiseptic, because of its high potency and minimal toxicity in comparison to other antiseptics of the day, and noted its laboratory value in the isolation of &quot;Bacillus influenzae&quot; (now called &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;).
Fleming did not convince anyone that his discovery was important. This was largely because penicillin was so difficult to isolate that its development as a drug seemed impossible. It is speculated that had Fleming been more successful at making other scientists interested in his work, penicillin would possibly have been developed years earlier.

The importance of his work has been recognized by the placement of an International Historic Chemical Landmark at the Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum in London on 19 November 1999.

=== Development and medical application ===

In 1930, Cecil George Paine, a pathologist at the Royal Infirmary in Sheffield, successfully treated ophthalmia neonatorum, a gonococcal infection in infants, with penicillin (fungal extract) on November 25, 1930.

In 1940, Australian scientist Howard Florey (later Baron Florey) and a team of researchers (Ernst Chain, Edward Abraham, Arthur Duncan Gardner, Norman Heatley, Margaret Jennings, Jean Orr-Ewing and Arthur Gordon Sanders) at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford made progress in making concentrated penicillin from fungal culture broth that showed both &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; bactericidal action. In 1941, they treated a policeman, Albert Alexander, with a severe face infection; his condition improved, but then supplies of penicillin ran out and he died. Subsequently, several other patients were treated successfully. In December 1942, survivors of the Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston were the first burn patients to be successfully treated with penicillin.

The first successful use of pure penicillin was in 1942 when Fleming cured Harry Lambert of an infection of the nervous system (streptococcal meningitis) which would otherwise have been fatal. By that time the Oxford team could produce only a small amount. Florey willingly gave the only available sample to Fleming. Lambert showed improvement from the very next day of the treatment, and was completely cured within a week. Fleming published his clinical trial in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1943. Following the medical breakthrough, the British War Cabinet set up the Penicillin Committee on 5 April 1943 that led to projects for mass production.

=== Mass production ===

As the medical application was established, the Oxford team found that it was impossible to produce usable amounts in their laboratory. Failing to persuade the British government, Florey and Heatley travelled to the US in June 1941 with their mould samples in order to interest the US government for large-scale production. They approached the USDA Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL, now the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research) at Peoria, Illinois, where facilities for large-scale fermentations were established. Mass culture of the mould and search for better moulds immediately followed.

On March 14, 1942, the first patient was treated for streptococcal sepsis with US-made penicillin produced by Merck &amp; Co. Half of the total supply produced at the time was used on that one patient, Anne Miller. By June 1942, just enough US penicillin was available to treat ten patients. In July 1943, the War Production Board drew up a plan for the mass distribution of penicillin stocks to Allied troops fighting in Europe. The results of fermentation research on corn steep liquor at the NRRL allowed the United States to produce 2.3 million doses in time for the invasion of Normandy in the spring of 1944. After a worldwide search in 1943, a mouldy cantaloupe in a Peoria, Illinois market was found to contain the best strain of mould for production using the corn steep liquor process. Six times as much penicillin could be produced compared to using Fleming&#x27;s mold. Pfizer scientist Jasper H. Kane suggested using a deep-tank fermentation method for producing large quantities of pharmaceutical-grade penicillin. Large-scale production resulted from the development of a deep-tank fermentation plant by chemical engineer Margaret Hutchinson Rousseau. As a direct result of the war and the War Production Board, by June 1945, over 646 billion units per year were being produced.

G. Raymond Rettew made a significant contribution to the American war effort by his techniques to produce commercial quantities of penicillin, wherein he combined his knowledge of mushroom spawn with the function of the Sharples Cream Separator. By 1943, Rettew&#x27;s lab was producing most of the world&#x27;s penicillin. During World War II, penicillin made a major difference in the number of deaths and amputations caused by infected wounds among Allied forces, saving an estimated 12–15% of lives. Availability was severely limited, however, by the difficulty of manufacturing large quantities of penicillin and by the rapid renal clearance of the drug, necessitating frequent dosing. Methods for mass production of penicillin were patented by Andrew Jackson Moyer in 1945. Florey had not patented penicillin, having been advised by Sir Henry Dale that doing so would be unethical.

Penicillin is actively excreted, and about 80% of a penicillin dose is cleared from the body within three to four hours of administration. Indeed, during the early penicillin era, the drug was so scarce and so highly valued that it became common to collect the urine from patients being treated, so that the penicillin in the urine could be isolated and reused. This was not a satisfactory solution, so researchers looked for a way to slow penicillin excretion. They hoped to find a molecule that could compete with penicillin for the organic acid transporter responsible for excretion, such that the transporter would preferentially excrete the competing molecule and the penicillin would be retained. The uricosuric agent probenecid proved to be suitable. When probenecid and penicillin are administered together, probenecid competitively inhibits the excretion of penicillin, increasing penicillin&#x27;s concentration and prolonging its activity. Eventually, the advent of mass-production techniques and semi-synthetic penicillins resolved the supply issues, so this use of probenecid declined. Probenecid is still useful, however, for certain infections requiring particularly high concentrations of penicillins.

After World War II, Australia was the first country to make the drug available for civilian use. In the U.S., penicillin was made available to the general public on March 15, 1945.

Fleming, Florey, and Chain shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the development of penicillin.

=== Structure determination and total synthesis ===

The chemical structure of penicillin was first proposed by Edward Abraham in 1942 and was later confirmed in 1945 using X-ray crystallography by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, who was also working at Oxford. She later in 1964 received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for this and other structure determinations.

Chemist John C. Sheehan at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) completed the first chemical synthesis of penicillin in 1957. Sheehan had started his studies into penicillin synthesis in 1948, and during these investigations developed new methods for the synthesis of peptides, as well as new protecting groups—groups that mask the reactivity of certain functional groups. Although the initial synthesis developed by Sheehan was not appropriate for mass production of penicillins, one of the intermediate compounds in Sheehan&#x27;s synthesis was 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), the nucleus of penicillin.

6-APA was discovered by researchers at the Beecham Research Laboratories (later the Beecham Group) in Surrey in 1957 (published in 1959). Attaching different groups to the 6-APA &#x27;nucleus&#x27; of penicillin allowed the creation of new forms of penicillins which are more versatile and better in activity.

=== Developments from penicillin ===
The narrow range of treatable diseases or &quot;spectrum of activity&quot; of the penicillins, along with the poor activity of the orally active phenoxymethylpenicillin, led to the search for derivatives of penicillin that could treat a wider range of infections. The isolation of 6-APA, the nucleus of penicillin, allowed for the preparation of semisynthetic penicillins, with various improvements over benzylpenicillin (bioavailability, spectrum, stability, tolerance).

The first major development was ampicillin in 1961. It offered a broader spectrum of activity than either of the original penicillins. Further development yielded β-lactamase-resistant penicillins, including flucloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and methicillin. These were significant for their activity against β-lactamase-producing bacterial species, but were ineffective against the methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) strains that subsequently emerged.

Another development of the line of true penicillins was the antipseudomonal penicillins, such as carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and piperacillin, useful for their activity against Gram-negative bacteria. However, the usefulness of the β-lactam ring was such that related antibiotics, including the mecillinams, the carbapenems, and, most important, the cephalosporins, still retain it at the center of their structures.

== Production ==
Penicillin is produced by the fermentation of various types of sugar by the fungus &quot;Penicillium rubens&quot;. The fermentation process produces penicillin as a secondary metabolite when the growth of the fungus is inhibited by stress. The biosynthetic pathway outlined below experiences feedback inhibition involving the by-product -lysine inhibiting the enzyme homocitrate synthase.

:: α-ketoglutarate + AcCoA → homocitrate → -α-aminoadipic acid → -lysine + β-lactam

The &quot;Penicillium&quot; cells are grown using a technique called fed-batch culture, in which the cells are constantly subjected to stress, which is required for induction of penicillin production. While the usage of glucose as a carbon source represses penicillin biosynthesis enzymes, lactose does not exert any effect and alkaline pH levels override this regulation. Excess phosphate, available oxygen, and usage of ammonium as a nitrogen source repress penicillin production, while methionine can act as a sole nitrogen/sulfur source with stimulating effects.

The biotechnological method of directed evolution has been applied to produce by mutation a large number of &quot;Penicillium&quot; strains. These techniques include error-prone PCR, DNA shuffling, ITCHY, and strand-overlap PCR.

=== Biosynthesis ===
The biosynthetic gene cluster for penicillin was first cloned and sequenced in 1990. Overall, there are three main and important steps to the biosynthesis of penicillin G (benzylpenicillin).

* The first step is the condensation of three amino acids—-α-aminoadipic acid, -cysteine, -valine into a tripeptide. Before condensing into the tripeptide, the amino acid -valine must undergo epimerization to become -valine. The condensed tripeptide is named δ-(-α-aminoadipyl)--cysteine--valine (ACV). The condensation reaction and epimerization are both catalyzed by the enzyme δ-(-α-aminoadipyl)--cysteine--valine synthetase (ACVS), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase or NRPS.
* The second step in the biosynthesis of penicillin G is the oxidative conversion of linear ACV into the bicyclic intermediate isopenicillin N by isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS), which is encoded by the gene &quot;pcbC&quot;. Isopenicillin N is a very weak intermediate, because it does not show strong antibiotic activity.
* The final step is a transamidation by isopenicillin N N-acyltransferase, in which the α-aminoadipyl side-chain of isopenicillin N is removed and exchanged for a phenylacetyl side-chain. This reaction is encoded by the gene &quot;penDE&quot;, which is unique in the process of obtaining penicillins.

<text>Muhiddin Piri ( 1470 – 1553), better known as Piri Reis (), was an Ottoman cartographer, admiral, navigator, corsair, and geographer. He is primarily known today for his cartographic works, including his 1513 world map and the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot; (&quot;Book of the Sea&quot;), a book with detailed information on early navigational techniques as well as relatively accurate charts for their time, describing the ports and cities of the Mediterranean Sea.

He was born in Gallipoli—a major Ottoman naval base—and sailed from an early age with his uncle Kemal Reis. They fought as corsairs in the Western Mediterranean until they were brought into the Ottoman Navy. Piri Reis fought alongside Kemal Reis in the Ottoman–Venetian wars. When his uncle died in 1511, Piri Reis returned to Gallipoli to begin his cartographic works. He created his first world map and likely began drafting the charts and notes that would form the basis of the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;. By 1516, he returned to the navy and took part in the Ottoman conquest of Egypt. After their victory, he presented the world map to Sultan Selim I. When Suleiman the Magnificent became sultan, Piri Reis completed the first version of the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;, which he dedicated and gifted to the sultan by 1521. Several years later, he created a more elaborate version at the urging of Grand Vizier Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha. His final surviving work is a 1528 world map, of which only the northwest corner remains (showing Greenland, Labrador, Newfoundland, Florida, Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Central America).

In 1546, Piri Reis became &quot;Hind Kapudan-ı Derya&quot;, or grand admiral of the Ottoman Fleet in the Indian Ocean, as well as admiral of the fleet in Egypt. He expanded the Indian Ocean fleet, retook several ports, and pushed the Portuguese out of the Red Sea. In the 1550s, he began a campaign to capture the Portuguese-controlled Hormuz Island at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. He abandoned the siege of Hormuz after several weeks, sacked the city, and looted the nearby Qeshm Island, where wealthy residents of Hormuz had evacuated. For failing to capture Hormuz, he was executed in 1553 in Cairo.

His cartographic work received little appreciation during his own life. There is no evidence that the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot; circulated outside the royal palace before 1550. After his death, hundreds of copies of the book were likely made. Over 40 copies survive today, spanning several centuries. When his 1513 world map was unearthed at the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul, it drew international attention. The map relies on many sources, including a lost map of the Caribbean from Christopher Columbus. This sparked greater interest in the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;, and facsimiles of both were published. Piri Reis and his cartography have since become a point of national pride for Turkey.

== Biography ==
===Early life and piracy===
Little is known about Piri Reis&#x27; background and early life. He was likely born around 1470 in Gallipoli on the Dardanelles. At the time, Gallipoli was a major naval base for the Ottoman Empire. He was born Muhiddin Piri; &quot;Reis&quot; was a military rank equivalent to captain. His uncle was Kemal Reis. Little is known about his parents. Piri Reis gives his father&#x27;s name as Hacı Mehmed. It is not clear from historical records whether Piri was the son of Kemal Reis&#x27; brother or sister. Kemal Reis had a brother-in-law from Nafpaktos who was arrested and tortured in Venice for alleged spying during the Ottoman–Venetian wars. He was possibly Piri Reis&#x27; father.

By age 12, he began sailing with his uncle Kemal Reis. Kemal was a notable corsair, a type of pirate who acted with the approval of a sovereign state. Led by Kemal Reis, the Barbary pirates threatened European maritime traffic. Piri Reis wrote of his early years, &quot;We sailed on the Mediterranean and fought the enemies of our religion mercilessly.&quot; He sailed with his uncle on raids, mainly on the coasts of Italy and Spain. By 1490, they were operating out of Béjaïa, Algeria. As a corsair, Piri Reis captured many ships, a fortress near Mallorca, and Pianosa near Corsica. During the Granada War, Piri Reis transported Muslims and Jews from Spain to North Africa. During the winters, he and his uncle took shelter in favorable harbors on the Barbary Coast.

===Naval career and cartography===
Piri Reis sailed under his uncle and later Hayreddin Barbarossa in the Ottoman Navy. To bolster the empire&#x27;s navy, Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II recruited Barbary and Aegean corsairs, including Piri and Kemal. Before Barbarossa reorganized the navy, sultans commonly employed former pirates. The addition of experienced corsairs raised the Ottoman Navy&#x27;s competence in open-sea combat and knowledge of the Mediterranean.

In 1495, Kemal Reis was imprisoned on Euboea for piracy and brought to the capital, Constantinople. Rather than being sentenced, he was given an official position in the navy. Piri Reis was with his uncle through this and later documented it in the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;. In the empire&#x27;s navy, Kemal and Piri advocated taking the Venetian coastal fortresses of the Peloponnese and the small but strategically valuable island of Rhodes. In his &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;, Piri Reis reports that his uncle had told Sultan Bayezid II, &quot;Venice has two eyes: Her left eye is the [harbor] fortress of Modon. Her right eye is that of Corfu.&quot;

Piri Reis took part in the Ottoman–Venetian wars, including the First Battle of Lepanto (Battle of Zonchio), Second Battle of Lepanto (Battle of Modon), and 1501 conquest of Navarino. During the First Battle of Lepanto, Piri Reis was one of many corsairs in a fleet of about 270 ships that fought through the Venetian fleet and entered the Gulf of Corinth, forcing the governor to surrender. Kemal Reis led the Ottomans in the battles to take the fortresses at Modon and Navarino. After the Ottoman navy defeated the Venetian fleet at the Peloponnese, they began to take control of the Eastern Mediterranean. In the early 1500s, Kemal Reis led raids on the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, and Pianosa in the western Mediterranean. In one naval battle, Piri Reis and his uncle captured a Spaniard who had participated in Columbus&#x27;s voyages, and likely possessed an early map of the Americas that Piri Reis would use as a source for his maps.

When his uncle died in a 1511 shipwreck in the Mediterranean, Piri Reis returned to Gallipoli to work on his navigational studies. The finished manuscript of his first world map was dated to the month of Muharram in the Islamic year 919 AH, equivalent to March 1513 AD. This work included the recently explored shores of the Americas and Africa. Although he had never sailed the Atlantic, he compiled over twenty maps of Arab, Spanish, Portuguese, Indian and older Greek origins into a comprehensive representation of the known world of his era. At least by 1513, Piri Reis was sailing again for the Ottomans under Hayreddin Barbarossa along the coast of North Africa.

By 1516, Piri Reis returned to the navy as captain of a galley in the Ottoman fleet and took part in the 1516–17 Ottoman conquest of Egypt. He was the commander of the Turkish fleet that blockaded Alexandria. After the Ottoman victory, Piri Reis presented the 1513 world map to Sultan Selim I (). It is unknown how Selim used the map, if at all, as it vanished from history until its rediscovery centuries later. According to Venetian documents, Piri Reis was no longer with the Ottoman navy in 1518 and was engaging in piracy in the Aegean Sea.

Piri Reis advocated for and took part in Suleiman the Magnificent&#x27;s 1522 Siege of Rhodes. The first version of his &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;—a nautical atlas gifted and dedicated to Suleiman—included advice on conquering Rhodes. The island of Rhodes had a secure harbor and was off the coast of Anatolia. Controlled by an adversary, it could threaten maritime communication between the empire&#x27;s capital and Mediterranean ports. The Knights of St. John controlled the island, took Muslim captives, and provided shelter to Christian pirates. During the siege, the Knights&#x27; fleet of ten ships remained in the harbor rather than confront the larger Ottoman force. The Ottoman Navy conducted an amphibious operation, transporting many troops to the small island, and the island surrendered in December 1522. The Knights of St. John later relocated to Malta. The second version of the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;, completed after the conquest of Rhodes, only discusses the events in terms of the practical concerns of acquiring drinking water from Karabağ in Bodrum prior to the siege.

The longer second version of the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot; resulted from a conversation with the empire&#x27;s grand vizier. Suleiman&#x27;s reign was the beginning of a shift towards power concentrating in a group of viziers, advisers, governors, and royal family members, including Suleiman&#x27;s childhood friend Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha who rose to grand vizier of the empire. When putting down Hain Ahmed Pasha&#x27;s 1524 rebellion in Egypt, Ibrahim rode aboard the navy&#x27;s flagship, commanded by Piri Reis. Piri Reis said they discussed cartography after Ibrahim asked him about the maps and charts being consulted aboard the ship. Ibrahim commissioned Piri Reis to create an expanded version of the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;. He finished it and gifted it to the sultan by 1526. In later centuries, many copies were made of both versions of the book. Piri Reis completed a second world map in 1528 or 1529. According to Sevim Tekeli, the changes from the first world map demonstrate that Piri Reis was actively following European voyages of discovery.

In both the 1513 world map and the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot; preface, Piri Reis rhetorically undermines the significance of European discoveries by reframing them as the rediscovery of ancient knowledge. He invokes Alexander the Great when explaining the discoveries of Columbus. According to the Quran and Turkish literary tradition, Dhu al-Qarnayn—believed to be a Quranic reference to Alexander the Great—traveled to every corner of the world, thereby defining its limits. Marginal inscriptions on the world map mention &quot;charts drawn in the days of Alexander&quot; and a book that &quot;fell into the hands&quot; of Columbus describing lands &quot;at the end of the Western Sea&quot;. In the 1526 version of the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;, he explicitly credits European discoveries to lost works created during legendary voyages of Alexander, &quot;My friend, the Franks both read and write everything there is to know about the science of the sea. But do not suppose that they invented such knowledge on their own; and if you wish, I will explain why. During his time, the famous ruler Alexander traveled over all the seas, and whatever he saw and whatever he heard he had recorded, item by item, by a competent person.&quot;

Venice saw Piri Reis as an adversary and obstacle to their aims in the Middle East during the 1530s. In 1532, he fought back Dalmatian pirates in the Adriatic. He attacked the Venetian-held castle at Coron in 1533, captured a Venetian galley in 1536, and chased Venetian ships out of the eastern Mediterranean.

===Grand Admiral of the Indian Ocean Fleet===
After Sinan Reis died in 1546, Piri Reis took his position as , or grand admiral of the Ottoman Fleet in the Indian Ocean, as well as admiral of the fleet in Egypt. Portuguese ships had raided the Red Sea as far as Suez and taken the port city of Aden in Yemen. The Portuguese navy employed sailing ships capable of navigation and combat in open seas, while the Ottoman navy relied mainly on galleys, which were more effective along the coasts. This limited Ottoman naval warfare to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and narrow straits around Arabia. The empire focused on using its navy to continue land-based expansion into new areas for tax revenue and agriculture.

Using his fleet based out of Suez, Egypt, Piri Reis led campaigns in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. On 26 February 1548, he recaptured Aden from the Portuguese. Piri Reis subdued the local Bedouin rulers of Basra in 1547 and began building a Persian Gulf fleet. The fleet conducted annual expansions in the Indian Ocean, and some local rulers began to ally with the Portuguese. 

The sultan instructed Piri Reis to take the Portuguese-controlled Hormuz Island at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. Taking Bahrain Island was a secondary objective. In April 1552, Piri Reis left Suez with 25 galleys, 5 ships, and 850 soldiers. In 1552, the Turkish fleet took Muscat after a one-month siege. The expedition took control of coastal lands in Yemen, Oman, and Arabia. The Portuguese prepared for the attack on Hormuz by evacuating most of the island. Wealthy residents took refuge on the nearby island of Qeshm, and the soldiers and royal family retreated to the fortress. 

The Turkish soldiers took the City of Hormuz, but could not take the fortress. They besieged and bombarded the fortress for several weeks, but Piri Reis grew concerned about the Portuguese fleet attacking them during the siege. The Ottoman forces ran low on gunpowder, and Kubad Pasha the governor of Basra did not send supplies to the siege. On 9 October 1552, the Ottomans retreated. They sacked the city, looted Qeshm, and retreated into the gulf with over a million pieces of gold. The fleet arrived at Basra by 1553. A letter from the Portuguese governor inside the fortress, dated 31 October 1552, said that the walls had been near collapsing, but that the Ottomans had run low on &quot;munitions, gunpowder, and other war materials&quot; much of which they had lost when a galleon sank on the way to Hormuz. The Portuguese governor of India, organized a fleet of 40 ships led by his nephew Antão de Noronha that reached Hormuz in November 1552.

In his 80s, Piri Reis was executed following his retreat at Hormuz. After the expedition&#x27;s failure, Kubad Pasha denied Piri Reis rowers for his galleys. Piri Reis returned to Egypt in 1553 with only two ships, loaded with gold. The sultan had him beheaded in Cairo; the exact date of his execution is unknown. A letter—dated 15 November 1553—written from diplomats in Constantinople to Venice said that he had been &quot;charged with having raised the siege of the fortress of Hormuz&quot;. He was possibly survived by a son, Mehmed Reis, who is known only from a single portolan map of the Aegean.

== Works ==
Three of his cartographic works survive in some form to the present day. Fragments of his 1513 world map and his 1528 world map are kept in museums in Istanbul. Copies of the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;, a navigational atlas, are kept in many libraries and museums around the world, although the two created by Piri Reis himself are lost.

=== Piri Reis map of 1513 ===

The Piri Reis map of 1513 is a world map compiled from a range of contemporary and classical sources. Approximately one third of the map survives, housed in the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul. The finished manuscript was dated to the Islamic year 919 AH, equivalent to 1513 AD. After the empire&#x27;s 1517 conquest of Egypt, Piri Reis presented the 1513 world map to Ottoman Sultan Selim I (). It is unknown how Selim used the map, if at all, as it vanished from history until its rediscovery centuries later. When rediscovered in 1929, the remaining fragment garnered international attention for including a partial copy of an otherwise lost map by Christopher Columbus.

The map is a portolan chart with compass roses from which lines of bearing radiate. Designed for navigation via dead reckoning, portolan charts use a windrose network rather than a longitude and latitude grid. It contains extensive notes primarily in Ottoman Turkish. The colophon in Arabic is written in a different handwriting, likely that of Piri Reis himself. The depiction of South America is detailed and accurate for its time. The northwestern coast combines features of Central America and Cuba into a single body of land. Scholars attribute the peculiar arrangement of the Caribbean to a now-lost map from Columbus that merged Cuba into the Asian mainland and Hispaniola with Marco Polo&#x27;s description of Japan. This reflects Columbus&#x27;s erroneous claim that he had found a new route to Asia. The southern coast of the Atlantic Ocean is most likely a version of &quot;Terra Australis&quot;.

The map is visually distinct from European portolan charts, influenced by the Islamic miniature tradition. It was unusual in the Islamic cartographic tradition for incorporating many non-Muslim sources. Historian Karen Pinto has described the positive portrayal of legendary creatures from the edge of the known world in the Americas as breaking away from the medieval Islamic idea of an impassable &quot;Encircling Ocean&quot; surrounding the Old World. Piri Reis adapted the elements of iconography from the traditional maps—which illustrated well-known routes, cities, and peoples—to the portolan portrayals of newly discovered coasts.

There are conflicting interpretations of the map. Scholarly debate exists over the specific sources used in the map&#x27;s creation and the number of source maps. Many areas on the map have not been conclusively identified with real or mythical places. Some authors have noted visual similarities to parts of the Americas not officially discovered by 1513, but there is no textual or historical evidence that the map represents land south of present-day Cananéia. A disproven 20th-century hypothesis identified the southern landmass with an ice-free Antarctic coast.

=== &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot; ===

The &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot; (), or &quot;Book of the Sea&quot;, is a navigational atlas. Piri Reis compiled navigational charts and notes into the most detailed portolan atlas of the sixteenth century. The &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot; combines information from a range of sources and Piri Reis&#x27; personal experience. The coast of North Africa relies little on outside sources. 

There are two versions of the book. The first version was composed between 1511 and 1521. The second, expanded version was produced as a commission for Ottoman Grand Vizier Pargalı İbrahim Pasha, and completed in 1526.

Both versions begin with a preface and were dedicated to the sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (). The main part of both versions is a nautical guide to the Mediterranean Sea. Separate chapters cover different locations with corresponding portolan charts. Piri Reis says he composed an atlas because any single map has limited space for written details, and some &quot;knowledge cannot be known from maps; it must be explained.&quot; There are 130 chapters in the first version and 210 in the second. The chapters start at the Dardanelles and move counter-clockwise around the Mediterranean. The maps have compass roses indicating North for each page. Scale is indicated only in the textual descriptions, not with scale bars. Standard portolan symbols indicate hazards, like dots for shallow water and crosses for rocks. Written when Ottoman sailors relied on oar-driven galleys and galiots, the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot; reflects their needs and capabilities. It gives information on coastal waters, safe harbors, hazards, and sources of fresh water.

The second version begins with a longer introduction written in verse. This introduction offers information on storms, winds, navigating with a compass, navigating by the stars, reading portolan charts, and the oceans. It includes information on recent Portuguese and Spanish voyages including the voyages of Christopher Columbus to the Americas and Vasco da Gama&#x27;s discovery of a sea route to India. It offers the first detailed Ottoman description of the Indian Ocean, and gives special attention to Hormuz Island at the strait leading into the Persian Gulf.

The book achieved fame only after Piri Reis&#x27; death. The known surviving manuscripts are all copies created beginning in the later 1500s. At least some portion of the book has been translated into English, modern Turkish, Greek, French, German, and Italian.

=== 1528 world map ===
Piri Reis compiled a second world map in 1528. Only a fragment of the map—the northwest corner—remains. The parchment fragment is approximately square. As with the 1513 map, the 1528 map has calligraphic inscriptions in Ottoman-Turkish written in the Arabic alphabet. The colophon is in Arabic, likely handwritten by Piri Reis himself. According to the colophon, Piri Reis compiled the map in 1528 in Gallipoli. However, he may not have completed it until 1529.

The 1528 map was a portolan chart like his earlier works. It uses a windrose network radiating out from compass roses. The map does include one line of latitude, the Tropic of Cancer; it is slightly south of the correct position for Cuba and the Yucatan. The map uses standard portolan colors and symbols. Dots indicate shallow waters and sand banks. Crosses indicate rocks and reefs. The ships painted on the map are two caravels and a carrack. The scale bars indicate between the sections of the scales.

Based on the design of recently explored geographical features like Greenland, Newfoundland, and Florida, the map likely relied on Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian maps from the 1520s. Notes on the map cite recent Portuguese voyages to Labrador and Newfoundland. Hispaniola and Cuba are much more accurate compared to the 1513 world map. Cuba, labeled &quot;Isla di Vana&quot;, is now correctly positioned as an island in the Caribbean. In contrast to the 1513 map, Piri Reis leaves areas that have not been explored blank. Only the explored southern coasts of the Florida peninsula are on the map. The geography of Florida is left ambiguous as potentially an island or peninsula. The Spanish Empire&#x27;s master map, the &quot;Padrón Real&quot;, included this type of ambiguous Florida until 1520, and it influenced Italian cartography like the Freducci map.

== Legacy ==
During his own life, there was limited appreciation for Piri Reis&#x27; cartography. Historian Svat Soucek said of the cartographic works of Piri Reis, &quot;They show that although the Ottoman Empire had the potential to participate in the discoveries, its ruling elite spurned the attempt to blaze a trail in this direction&quot;. The 1513 world map disappeared from the historical record until its rediscovery centuries later. There is no evidence that either version of his atlas circulated outside the royal palace prior to 1550. The copies produced in the following centuries were often created for their aesthetic or artistic value. No Turkish school of cartography or navigation was established to build on his work. Murat Reis the Elder&#x27;s expedition to the Canary Islands and the 1586 Sack of Lanzarote were some of the few times when Piri Reis&#x27; Atlantic cartography was likely used by the Ottoman Navy. The empire&#x27;s navy—even during the Canary Islands expedition—remained largely composed of oar-driven galleys after the point where other naval powers were moving to sailing ships that were more suited to the open oceans. Ottoman scholar Kâtip Çelebi built on the &quot;Kitab-i Bahriye&quot; in his seventeenth-century work, &quot;Müntehab-ı Bahriyye&quot;. By the eighteenth century, major works of cartography from Western Europe were being translated into Turkish. 

When Piri Reis&#x27; world map was unearthed in 1929, it received international media attention for containing the surviving piece of an otherwise lost map of Christopher Columbus. Turkey&#x27;s first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, took an interest in the map and initiated projects to publish facsimiles and conduct research. Discovered during Atatürk&#x27;s reforms, the map was a point of national pride. Its rediscovery also sparked interest in the &quot;Kitab-ı Bahriye&quot;. A facsimile of the book&#x27;s second version was published by the Turkish Historical Society in 1935, and a four-volume facsimile with photographic quality was published in 1988. Several ships and submarines have been named after him, including the RV K. &quot;Piri Reis&quot; and TCG &quot;Pirireis&quot;. The Piri Reis University for maritime studies was founded in 2008. In the Turkish TV series &quot;&quot;, he is portrayed by actor Emir Benderlioğlu.

Piri Reis&#x27; 1513 world map is the target of various pseudoscientific claims and is sometimes invoked in broader pop culture as an unsolved mystery. Civil engineer Arlington Mallery, professor Charles Hapgood, and Hapgood&#x27;s students developed the hypothesis that the 1513 world map contained cartographic information, notably from an ice-free Antarctic coast, that exceeded the map-making abilities of the sixteenth century. In his 1966 book &quot;Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings&quot;, Hapgood claims islands along the map&#x27;s southern Atlantic shore to be ice-covered mountains in Antarctica&#x27;s Queen Maud Land region. Hapgood&#x27;s book was met with skepticism due to its lack of evidence and reliance on polar shift. According to geologist Paul Heinrich, the book also did not account for post-glacial rebound, and the 1949 survey initially cited by Mallery could not measure even one percent of the area drawn in the Piri Reis map. Subsequent studies have shown no significant similarities to Antarctica&#x27;s coast. Hapgood&#x27;s claims have been uncritically repeated by Erich von Däniken in support of ancient astronauts and by Graham Hancock in support of an advanced lost civilization. The map and polar shift were key plot elements in Allan W. Eckert&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;The HAB Theory&quot;. Piri Reis is a character in the &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; franchise. In the 2010 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood&quot;, a group of Italian Assassins sent from Rome to Constantinople by Ezio Auditore da Firenze infiltrates Piri Reis&#x27; shop to steal some of his maps detailing the New World, to match the Templars&#x27; expansion into the new lands. He appears in its 2011 sequel &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Revelations&quot;, set in early sixteenth-century Constantinople.

<doc id="23315" wikidata="Q39631" url="?curid=23315" title="Physician">
<text>A physician, medical practitioner (British English), medical doctor, or simply doctor is a health professional who practices medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients, and methods of treatment—known as specialities—or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communities—known as general practice. Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines, such as anatomy and physiology, underlying diseases, and their treatment, which is the science of medicine, and a decent competence in its applied practice, which is the art or craft of the profession.

Both the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world. Degrees and other qualifications vary widely, but there are some common elements, such as medical ethics requiring that physicians show consideration, compassion, and benevolence for their patients.

==Modern meanings==
===Specialist in internal medicine===

Around the world, the term physician refers to a specialist in internal medicine or one of its many sub-specialties (especially as opposed to a specialist in surgery). This meaning of physician conveys a sense of expertise in treatment by drugs or medications, rather than by the procedures of surgeons.

This term is at least nine hundred years old in English: physicians and surgeons were once members of separate professions, and traditionally were rivals. The &quot;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, third edition, gives a Middle English quotation making this contrast, from as early as 1400: &quot;O Lord, whi is it so greet difference betwixe a cirugian and a physician.&quot;

Henry VIII granted a charter to the London Royal College of Physicians in 1518. It was not until 1540 that he granted the Company of Barber-Surgeons (ancestor of the Royal College of Surgeons) its separate charter. In the same year, the English monarch established the Regius Professorship of Physic at the University of Cambridge. Newer universities would probably describe such an academic as a professor of internal medicine. Hence, in the 16th century, &quot;physic&quot; meant roughly what internal medicine does now.

Currently, a specialist physician in the United States may be described as an &quot;internist&quot;. Another term, &quot;hospitalist&quot;, was introduced in 1996, to describe US specialists in internal medicine who work largely or exclusively in hospitals. Such &#x27;hospitalists&#x27; now make up about 19% of all US &quot;general internists&quot;, who are often called &quot;general physicians&quot; in Commonwealth countries.

This original use, as distinct from surgeon, is common in most of the world including the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries (such as Australia, Bangladesh, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Zimbabwe), as well as in places as diverse as Brazil, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Ireland, and Taiwan. In such places, the more general English terms &quot;doctor&quot; or &quot;medical practitioner&quot; are prevalent, describing any practitioner of medicine (whom an American would likely call a physician, in the broad sense). In Commonwealth countries, specialist pediatricians and geriatricians are also described as specialist physicians who have sub-specialized by age of patient rather than by organ system.

===Physician and surgeon===

Around the world, the combined term &quot;physician and surgeon&quot; is used to describe either a general practitioner or any medical practitioner irrespective of specialty. This usage still shows the original meaning of physician and preserves the old difference between a physician, as a practitioner of &quot;physic&quot;, and a surgeon. The term may be used by state medical boards in the United States, and by equivalent bodies in Canadian provinces, to describe any medical practitioner.

===North America===
In modern English, the term &quot;physician&quot; is used in two main ways, with relatively broad and narrow meanings respectively. This is the result of history and is often confusing. These meanings and variations are explained below.

In the United States and Canada, the term &quot;physician&quot; describes all medical practitioners holding a professional medical degree. The American Medical Association, established in 1847, as well as the American Osteopathic Association, founded in 1897, both currently use the term &quot;physician&quot; to describe members. However, the American College of Physicians, established in 1915, does not: its title uses &quot;physician&quot; in its original sense.

====American physicians====
The vast majority of physicians trained in the United States have a Doctor of Medicine degree, and use the initials M.D. A smaller number attend osteopathic medical schools and have a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree and use the initials D.O. The World Directory of Medical Schools lists both MD and DO granting schools as &quot;medical schools&quot; located in the United States. After completion of medical school, physicians complete a residency in the specialty in which they will practice. Subspecialties require the completion of a fellowship after residency. Both MD and DO physicians participate in the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) and attend ACGME-accredited residencies and fellowships across all medical specialties to obtain licensure.

All boards of certification now require that physicians demonstrate, by examination, continuing mastery of the core knowledge and skills for a chosen specialty. Recertification varies by particular specialty between every seven and every ten years.

==== Primary care ====
Primary care physicians guide patients in preventing disease and detecting health problems early while they are still treatable. They are divided into two types: family medicine doctors and internal medicine doctors. Family doctors, or family physicians, are trained to care for patients of any age, while internists are trained to care for adults. Family doctors receive training in a variety of care and are therefore also referred to as general practitioners. Family medicine grew out of the general practitioner movement of the 1960s in response to the growing specialization in medicine that was seen as threatening to the doctor-patient relationship and continuity of care.

====Podiatry====
In the United States, the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) defines podiatrists as physicians and surgeons who treat the foot, ankle, and associated structures of the leg. Podiatrists undergo training with the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) degree. The American Medical Association (AMA), however, advocates for the definition of a &quot;physician&quot; as &quot;an individual possessing degree of either a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine.&quot; In the US, podiatrists are required to complete three to four years of podiatry residency upon graduating with a DPM degree. After residency, one to two years of fellowship programs are available in plastic surgery, foot and ankle reconstructive surgery, sports medicine, and wound care.

Podiatry residencies and/ or fellowships are not accredited by the ACGME. The overall scope of podiatric practice varies from state to state and is not similar to that of physicians holding an MD or DO degree. DPM is also available at one Canadian university, namely the ; students are typically required to complete an internship in New York prior to obtaining their professional degree. The World Directory of Medical Schools does not list US or Canadian schools of podiatric medicine as &quot;medical schools&quot; and only lists US-granted MD, DO, and Canadian MD programs as medical schools for the respective regions.

==Shortage==
Many countries in the developing world have the problem of too few physicians. In 2015, the Association of American Medical Colleges warned that the US will face a doctor shortage of as many as 90,000 by 2025. Long medical working hours, shift work and sleep deprivation contribute to medical errors.

==Social role and world view==
===Biomedicine===
Within Western culture and over recent centuries, medicine has become increasingly based on scientific reductionism and materialism. This style of medicine is now dominant throughout the industrialized world, and is often termed &quot;biomedicine&quot; by medical anthropologists. Biomedicine &quot;formulates the human body and disease in a culturally distinctive pattern&quot;, and is a world view learnt by medical students. Within this tradition, the medical model is a term for the complete &quot;set of procedures in which all doctors are trained&quot;, including mental attitudes. A particularly clear expression of this world view, currently dominant among conventional physicians, is evidence-based medicine. Within conventional medicine, most physicians still pay heed to their ancient traditions:

In this Western tradition, physicians are considered to be members of a learned profession, and enjoy high social status, often combined with expectations of a high and stable income and job security. However, medical practitioners often work long and inflexible hours, with shifts at unsociable times. Their high status is partly from their extensive training requirements, and also because of their occupation&#x27;s special ethical and legal duties. The term traditionally used by physicians to describe a person seeking their help is the word &quot;patient&quot; (although one who visits a physician for a routine check-up may also be so described). This word is an ancient reminder of medical duty, as it originally meant &#x27;one who suffers&#x27;. The English noun comes from the Latin word &quot;patiens&quot;, the present participle of the deponent verb, , meaning &#x27;I am suffering&#x27;, and akin to the Greek verb ( &quot;paschein&quot;, to suffer) and its cognate noun (, suffering).

Physicians in the original, narrow sense (specialist physicians or internists, see above) are commonly members or fellows of professional organizations, such as the American College of Physicians or the Royal College of Physicians in the United Kingdom, and such hard-won membership is itself a mark of status. 

===Alternative medicine===
While contemporary biomedicine has distanced itself from its ancient roots in religion and magic, many forms of traditional medicine and alternative medicine continue to espouse vitalism in various guises: &quot;As long as life had its own secret properties, it was possible to have sciences and medicines based on those properties&quot;. The US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) classifies complementary and alternative medicine therapies into five categories or domains, including: alternative medical systems, or complete systems of therapy and practice; mind-body interventions, or techniques designed to facilitate the mind&#x27;s effect on bodily functions and symptoms; biologically based systems including herbalism; and manipulative and body-based methods such as chiropractic and massage therapy.

In considering these alternate traditions that differ from biomedicine (see above), medical anthropologists emphasize that all ways of thinking about health and disease have a significant cultural content, including conventional western medicine.

Ayurveda, Unani medicine, and homeopathy are popular types of alternative medicine.

===Physicians&#x27; own health===
Some commentators have argued that physicians have duties to serve as role models for the general public in matters of health, for example by not smoking cigarettes. Indeed, in most western nations relatively few physicians smoke, and their professional knowledge does appear to have a beneficial effect on their health and lifestyle. According to a study of male physicians in the United States, life expectancy is slightly higher for physicians (73 years for white and 69 years for black) than lawyers or many other highly educated professionals. Causes of death which are less likely to occur in physicians than the general population include respiratory disease (including pneumonia, pneumoconioses, COPD, but excluding emphysema and other chronic airway obstruction), alcohol-related deaths, rectosigmoid and anal cancers, and bacterial diseases.

Physicians do experience exposure to occupational hazards, and there is a well-known aphorism that &quot;doctors make the worst patients&quot;. Causes of death that are shown to be higher in the physician population include suicide among doctors and self-inflicted injury, drug-related causes, traffic accidents, and cerebrovascular and ischaemic heart disease. Physicians are also prone to occupational burnout. This manifests as a long-term stress reaction characterized by poorer quality of care towards patients, emotional exhaustion, a feeling of decreased personal achievement, and others. A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reported that time pressure was the greatest cause of burnout; a survey from the American Medical Association reported that more than half of all respondents chose &quot;too many bureaucratic tasks&quot; as the leading cause of burnout.

==Education and training==
Medical education and career pathways for doctors vary considerably across the world.

===All medical practitioners===
In all developed countries, entry-level medical education programs are tertiary-level courses, undertaken at a medical school attached to a university. Depending on jurisdiction and university, entry may follow directly from secondary school or require pre-requisite undergraduate education. The former commonly takes five or six years to complete. Programs that require previous undergraduate education (typically a three- or four-year degree, often in science) are usually four or five years in length. Hence, gaining a basic medical degree may typically take from five to eight years, depending on jurisdiction and university.

Following the completion of entry-level training, newly graduated medical practitioners are often required to undertake a period of supervised practice before full registration is granted, typically one or two years. This may be referred to as an &quot;internship&quot;, as the &quot;foundation&quot; years in the UK, or as &quot;conditional registration&quot;. Some jurisdictions, including the United States, require residencies for practice.

Medical practitioners hold a medical degree specific to the university from which they graduated. This degree qualifies the medical practitioner to become licensed or registered under the laws of that particular country, and sometimes of several countries, subject to requirements for an internship or conditional registration.

===Specialists in internal medicine===
Specialty training is begun immediately following completion of entry-level training, or even before. In other jurisdictions, junior medical doctors must undertake generalist (un-streamed) training for one or more years before commencing specialization. Hence, depending on the jurisdiction, a specialist physician (internist) often does not achieve recognition as a specialist until twelve or more years after commencing basic medical training—five to eight years at university to obtain a basic medical qualification, and up to another nine years to become a specialist.

==Regulation==
In most jurisdictions, physicians (in either sense of the word) need government permission to practice. Such permission is intended to promote public safety, and often to protect government spending, as medical care is commonly subsidized by national governments.

In some jurisdictions such as in Singapore, it is common for physicians to inflate their qualifications with the title &quot;Dr&quot; in correspondence or namecards, even if their qualifications are limited to a basic (e.g., bachelor level) degree. In other countries such as Germany, only physicians holding an academic doctorate may call themselves doctor – on the other hand, the European Research Council has decided that the German medical doctorate does not meet the international standards of a PhD research degree.

===All medical practitioners===
Among the English-speaking countries, this process is known either as licensure as in the United States, or as registration in the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth countries, and Ireland. Synonyms in use elsewhere include &quot;colegiación&quot; in Spain, &quot;ishi menkyo&quot; in Japan, &quot;autorisasjon&quot; in Norway, &quot;Approbation&quot; in Germany, and in Greece. In France, Italy and Portugal, civilian physicians must be members of the Order of Physicians to practice medicine.

In some countries, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, the profession largely regulates itself, with the government affirming the regulating body&#x27;s authority. The best-known example of this is probably the General Medical Council of Britain. In all countries, the regulating authorities will revoke permission to practice in cases of malpractice or serious misconduct.

In the large English-speaking federations (United States, Canada, Australia), the licensing or registration of medical practitioners is done at a state or provincial level, or nationally as in New Zealand. Australian states usually have a &quot;Medical Board&quot;, which has now been replaced by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) in most states, while Canadian provinces usually have a &quot;College of Physicians and Surgeons&quot;. All American states have an agency that is usually called the &quot;Medical Board&quot;, although there are alternate names such as &quot;Board of Medicine&quot;, &quot;Board of Medical Examiners&quot;, &quot;Board of Medical Licensure&quot;, &quot;Board of Healing Arts&quot; or some other variation. After graduating from a first-professional school, physicians who wish to practice in the US usually take standardized exams, such as the USMLE for a Doctor in Medicine.

===Specialists in internal medicine===
Most countries have some method of officially recognizing specialist qualifications in all branches of medicine, including internal medicine. Sometimes, this aims to promote public safety by restricting the use of hazardous treatments. Other reasons for regulating specialists may include standardization of recognition for hospital employment and restriction on which practitioners are entitled to receive higher insurance payments for specialist services.

=== Performance and professionalism supervision ===
The issue of medical errors, drug abuse, and other issues in physician professional behavior received significant attention across the world, in particular following a critical 2000 report which &quot;arguably launched&quot; the patient-safety movement. In the US, as of 2006 there were few organizations that systematically monitored performance. In the US, only the Department of Veterans Affairs randomly drug tests physicians, in contrast to drug testing practices for other professions that have a major impact on public welfare. Licensing boards at the US state-level depend upon continuing education to maintain competence. Through the utilization of the National Practitioner Data Bank, Federation of State Medical Boards&#x27; disciplinary report, and American Medical Association Physician Profile Service, the 67 State Medical Boards continually self-report any adverse/disciplinary actions taken against a licensed physician in order that the other Medical Boards in which the physician holds or is applying for a medical license will be properly notified so that corrective, reciprocal action can be taken against the offending physician. In Europe, as of 2009 the health systems are governed according to various national laws, and can also vary according to regional differences similar to the United States.

<text>The pound or pound-mass is a unit of mass used in both the British imperial and United States customary systems of measurement. Various definitions have been used; the most common today is the international avoirdupois pound, which is legally defined as exactly , and which is divided into 16 avoirdupois ounces. The international standard symbol for the avoirdupois pound is lb; an alternative symbol (when there might otherwise be a risk of confusion with the pound-force) is lbm (for most pound definitions), # (chiefly in the U.S.), and  or ̶ (specifically for the apothecaries&#x27; pound).

The unit is descended from the Roman (hence the symbol &quot;lb&quot;, descended from the scribal abbreviation, &quot;&quot;). The English word &quot;pound&quot; comes from the Roman (&#x27;the weight measured in &#x27;), and is cognate with, among others, German , Dutch , and Swedish . These units are now designated as historical and are no longer in common usage, being replaced by the metric system.

Usage of the unqualified term &quot;pound&quot; reflects the historical conflation of mass and weight. This accounts for the modern distinguishing terms &quot;pound-mass&quot; and &quot;pound-force&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The word &#x27;pound&#x27; and its cognates ultimately derive from a borrowing into Proto-Germanic of the Latin expression (&#x27;the weight measured in &#x27;), in which the word is the ablative singular of the Latin noun (&#x27;weight&#x27;).

== Current use ==
The United States and the Commonwealth of Nations agreed upon common definitions for the pound and the yard. Since 1 July 1959, the international avoirdupois pound (symbol lb) has been defined as exactly .

In the United Kingdom, the use of the international pound was implemented in the Weights and Measures Act 1963.

An avoirdupois pound is equal to 16 avoirdupois ounces and to exactly 7,000 grains. The conversion factor between the kilogram and the international pound was therefore chosen to be divisible by 7 with a terminating decimal representation, and an (international) grain is thus equal to exactly .

In the United Kingdom, the process of metrication and European units of measurement directives were expected to eliminate the use of the pound and ounce, but in 2007 the European Commission abandoned the requirement for metric-only labelling on packaged goods there, and allowed for dual metric–imperial marking to continue indefinitely.

In the United States, the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 declared the metric system to be the &quot;preferred system of weights and measures&quot; but did not suspend use of United States customary units, and the United States is the only industrialised country where commercial activities do not predominantly use the metric system, despite many efforts to do so, and the pound remains widely used as one of the key customary units.

== Historical use ==

Historically, in different parts of the world, at different points in time, and for different applications, the pound (or its translation) has referred to broadly similar but not identical standards of mass or force.

=== Roman ===
The (Latin for &#x27;scale&#x27;/&#x27;balance&#x27;) is an ancient Roman unit of mass that is now equivalent to . It was divided into 12 (singular: ), or ounces. The is the origin of the abbreviation for pound, &quot;lb&quot;.

=== In Britain ===
A number of different definitions of the pound have historically been used in Britain. Among these are the avoirdupois pound, which is the common pound used for weights, and the obsolete tower, merchants&#x27; and London pounds. The troy pound and ounce remain in use only for the weight of precious metals, especially in their trade. The weights of traded precious metals, such as gold and silver, are normally quoted just in ounces (e.g. &quot;500 ounces&quot;) and, when the type of ounce is not explicitly stated, the troy system is assumed.

The pound sterling money system, which was introduced during the reign of King Offa of Mercia (757–96), was based originally on a Saxon pound of silver. After the Norman conquest the Saxon pound was known as the tower pound or moneyer&#x27;s pound. In 1528, during the reign of Henry VIII, the coinage standard was changed by parliament from the tower pound to the troy pound.

==== Avoirdupois pound ====

The avoirdupois pound, also known as the wool pound, first came into general use c. 1300. It was initially equal to 6,992 troy grains. The pound avoirdupois was divided into 16 ounces. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the avoirdupois pound was redefined as 7,000 troy grains. Since then, the grain has often been an integral part of the avoirdupois system. By 1758, two Elizabethan Exchequer standard weights for the avoirdupois pound existed, and when measured in troy grains they were found to be of 7,002 grains and 6,999 grains.

===== Imperial Standard Pound =====
In the United Kingdom, weights and measures have been defined by a long series of Acts of Parliament, the intention of which has been to regulate the sale of commodities. Materials traded in the marketplace are quantified according to accepted units and standards in order to avoid fraud. The standards themselves are legally defined so as to facilitate the resolution of disputes brought to the courts; only legally defined measures will be recognised by the courts. Quantifying devices used by traders (weights, weighing machines, containers of volumes, measures of length) are subject to official inspection, and penalties apply if they are fraudulent.

The Weights and Measures Act 1878 (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 49) marked a major overhaul of the British system of weights and measures, and the definition of the pound given there remained in force until the 1960s. The pound was defined thus (Section 4) &quot;The ... platinum weight ... deposited in the Standards department of the Board of Trade ... shall continue to be the imperial standard of ... weight ... and the said platinum weight shall continue to be the Imperial Standard for determining the Imperial Standard Pound for the United Kingdom&quot;. Paragraph 13 states that the weight of this standard shall be called the Imperial Standard Pound, and that all other weights mentioned in the act and permissible for commerce shall be ascertained from it alone. The first schedule of the act gave more details of the standard pound: it is a platinum cylinder nearly high, and diameter, and the edges are carefully rounded off. It has a groove about from the top, to allow the cylinder to be lifted using an ivory fork. It was constructed following the destruction of the Houses of Parliament by fire in 1834, and is stamped &quot;P.S. 1844, 1 lb&quot; (P.S. stands for &quot;Parliamentary Standard&quot;).

===== Redefinition in terms of the kilogram =====
The British Weights and Measures Act 1878 (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 49) said that contracts worded in terms of metric units would be deemed by the courts to be made according to the Imperial units defined in the Act, and a table of metric equivalents was supplied so that the Imperial equivalents could be legally calculated. This defined, in UK law, metric units in terms of Imperial ones. The equivalence for the pound was given as 1 lb = or 0.45359 kg, which made the kilogram equivalent to about . 

In 1883, it was determined jointly by the standards department of the British Board of Trade and the Bureau International that was a better approximation, and this figure, rounded to was given legal status by an Order in Council in May 1898.

In 1959, based on further measurements and international coordination, the International Yard and Pound Agreement defined an &quot;international pound&quot; as being equivalent to exactly . This meant that the existing legal definition of the UK pound differed from the international standard pound by . To remedy this, the pound was again redefined in the United Kingdom by the Weights and Measures Act 1963 to match the international pound, stating: &quot;the pound shall be 0.453 592 37 kilogramme exactly&quot;, a definition which remains valid to the present day.

The 2019 revision of the SI means that the pound is now defined precisely in terms of fundamental constants, ending the era of its definition in terms of physical prototypes.

==== Troy pound ====
A troy pound (abbreviated lb t) is equal to 12 troy ounces and to 5,760 grains, that is exactly grams. Troy weights were used in England by jewellers. Apothecaries also used the troy pound and ounce, but added the drachms and scruples unit in the apothecaries&#x27; system of weights.

Troy weight may take its name from the French market town of Troyes in France where English merchants traded at least as early as the early 9th century. The troy pound is no longer in general use or a legal unit for trade (it was abolished in the United Kingdom on 6 January 1879 by the Weights and Measures Act 1878), but the troy ounce, of a troy pound, is still used for measurements of gems such as opals, and precious metals such as silver, platinum and particularly gold.

==== Tower pound ====

A tower pound is equal to 12 tower ounces and to 5,400 troy grains, which equals around 350 grams. The tower pound is the historical weight standard that was used for England&#x27;s coinage. Before the Norman conquest in 1066, the tower pound was known as the Saxon pound. During the reign of King Offa (757–96) of Mercia, a Saxon pound of silver was used to set the original weight of a pound sterling. From one Saxon pound of silver (that is a tower pound) the king had 240 silver pennies minted. In the pound sterling monetary system, twelve pennies equaled a shilling and twenty shillings equaled a pound sterling.

The tower pound was referenced to a standard prototype found in the Tower of London. The tower system ran concurrently with the avoirdupois and troy systems until the reign of Henry VIII, when a royal proclamation dated 1526 required that the troy pound be used for mint purposes instead of the tower pound. No standards of the tower pound are known to have survived.

The tower pound was also called the moneyers&#x27; pound (referring to the Saxon moneyers before the Norman conquest); the easterling pound, which may refer to traders of eastern Germany, or to traders on the shore of the eastern Baltic sea, or dealers of Asiatic goods who settled at the London Steelyard wharf; and the Rochelle pound by French writers, because it was also in use at La Rochelle. An almost identical weight was employed by the Germans for weighing gold and silver.

The mercantile pound (1304) of 6750 troy grains, or 9600 Tower grains, derives from this pound, as 25 shilling-weights or 15 Tower ounces, for general commercial use. Multiple pounds based on the same ounce were quite common. In much of Europe, the apothecaries&#x27; and commercial pounds were different numbers of the same ounce.
==== Merchants&#x27; pound ====
The merchants&#x27; pound (&quot;mercantile pound&quot;, , or &quot;commercial pound&quot;) was considered to be composed of 25 rather than 20 Tower shillings of 12 pence. It was equal to 9,600 wheat grains (15 tower ounces or 6,750 grains) and was used in England until the 14th century for goods other than money and medicine (&quot;electuaries&quot;).

==== London pound ====

The London pound is that of the Hansa, as used in their various trading places. The London pound is based on 16 ounces, each ounce divided as the tower ounce. It never became a legal standard in England; the use of this pound waxed and waned with the influence of the Hansa itself.

A London pound was equal to 7,200 troy grains (16 troy ounces) or, equivalently, 10,240 tower grains (16 tower ounces).

=== In the United States ===
In the United States, the avoirdupois pound as a unit of mass has been officially defined in terms of the kilogram since the Mendenhall Order of 1893. That order defined the pound to be pounds to a kilogram. The following year, this relationship was refined as pounds to a kilogram, following a determination of the British pound.

In 1959, the United States National Bureau of Standards redefined the pound (avoirdupois) to be exactly equal to 0.453 592 37 kilograms, as had been declared by the International Yard and Pound Agreement of that year. According to a 1959 NIST publication, the United States 1894 pound differed from the international pound by approximately one part in 10 million. The difference is so insignificant that it can be ignored for almost all practical purposes.

=== Byzantine litra ===

The Byzantines used a series of measurements known as pounds (, ). The most common was the (, &quot;pound of account&quot;), established by Constantine the Great in 309/310. It formed the basis of the Byzantine monetary system, with one of gold equivalent to 72 . A hundred were known as a (, &quot;hundredweight&quot;). Its weight seems to have decreased gradually from the original to . Due to its association with gold, it was also known as the (, &quot;gold pound&quot;) or (, &quot;maritime pound&quot;), but it could also be used as a measure of land, equalling a fortieth of the .

The was specifically used for weighing olive oil or wood, and corresponded to 4/5 of the or . Some outlying regions, especially in later times, adopted various local measures, based on Italian, Arab or Turkish measures. The most important of these was the (, &quot;silver pound&quot;) of , found in Trebizond and Cyprus, and probably of Arab origin.

=== French livre ===
Since the Middle Ages, various pounds () have been used in France. Since the 19th century, a has referred to the &quot;metric pound&quot;, 500 g.

The is equivalent to about and was used between the late 9th century and the mid-14th century.

The or is equivalent to about and was used between the 1350s and the late 18th century. It was introduced by the government of John II.

The was set equal to the kilogram by the decree of between 1800 and 1812. This was a form of official metric pound.

The (customary unit) was defined as by the decree of 28 March 1812. It was abolished as a unit of mass effective 1 January 1840 by a decree of 4 July 1837, but is still used informally.

=== German and Austrian Pfund ===
Originally derived from the Roman libra, the definition varied throughout the Holy Roman Empire in the Middle Ages and onward. For example, the measures and weights of the Habsburg monarchy were reformed in 1761 by Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The unusually heavy Habsburg (civil) pound of 16 ounces was later defined in terms of . Bavarian reforms in 1809 and 1811 adopted essentially the same standard as the Austrian pound. In Prussia, a reform in 1816 defined a uniform civil pound in terms of the Prussian foot and distilled water, resulting in a Prussian pound of .

Between 1803 and 1815, all German regions west of the River Rhine were under French control, organised in the departements: Roer, Sarre, Rhin-et-Moselle, and Mont-Tonnerre. As a result of the Congress of Vienna, these regions again became part of various German states. However, many of these regions retained the metric system and adopted a metric pound of precisely . In 1854, the pound of 500 g also became the official mass standard of the German Customs Union and was renamed the , but local pounds continued to co-exist with the pound for some time in some German states. Nowadays, the term is sometimes still in use and universally refers to a pound of 500 g.

=== Russian ===
The Russian pound (, ) is an obsolete Russian unit of measurement of mass. It is equal to . In 1899, the was the basic unit of weight, and all other units of weight were formed from it; in particular, a was of a funt, and a was 40 .
The was a Scandinavian measurement that varied in weight between regions. From the 17th century onward, it was equal to in Sweden but was abandoned in 1889 when Sweden switched to the metric system.

In Norway, the same name was used for a weight of . In Denmark, it equaled .

In the 19th century, Denmark followed Germany&#x27;s lead and redefined the pound as .

=== Portuguese and ===
The Portuguese unit that corresponds to the pounds of different nations is the , equivalent to 16 ounces of , a variant of the Cologne standard. This was introduced in 1499 by Manuel I, king of Portugal. Based on an evaluation of bronze nesting weight piles distributed by Manuel I to different towns, the of Manuel I has been estimated to be of . In the early 19th century, the was evaluated at .

In the 15th century, the was of 14 ounces of or . The Portuguese was the same as 2 . There were also of 12.5 and 13 ounces and of 15 and 16 ounces. The or standard was also used.

=== Jersey pound ===
A Jersey pound is an obsolete unit of mass used on the island of Jersey from the 14th century to the 19th century. It was equivalent to about 7,561 grains (). It may have been derived from the French livre poids de marc.

=== Trone pound ===
The trone pound is one of a number of obsolete Scottish units of measurement. It was equivalent to between 21 and 28 avoirdupois ounces (about ).

=== Metric pound ===
In many countries, upon the introduction of a metric system, the pound (or its translation) became an historic and obsolete term, although some have kept it as an informal term without a specific value. In German, the term is , in French , in Dutch , in Spanish and Portuguese , in Italian , and in Danish and Swedish .

Though not from the same linguistic origin, the Chinese (, also known as the &quot;catty&quot;) in mainland China has a modern definition of exactly , divided into 10 (). Traditionally around , the has been in use for more than two thousand years varying in exact value from one period to another, serving the same purpose as &quot;pound&quot; for the common-use measure of weight. In Hong Kong, for the purposes of commerce and trade between Britain and Imperial China in the preceding centuries, three Chinese catties were equivalent to four British imperial pounds, defining one catty as in weight precisely. 

Hundreds of older pounds were replaced in this way. Examples of the older pounds are one of around in Spain, Portugal, and Latin America; one of in Norway; and several different ones in what is now Germany.

From the introduction of the kilogram scales and measuring devices are denominated only in grams and kilograms. A pound of product must be determined by weighing the product in grams as the use of the &quot;pound&quot; is not sanctioned for trade within the European Union.

== Use in weaponry ==

Smoothbore cannon and carronades are currently designated by the weight in imperial pounds of round solid iron shot of diameter to fit the barrel. A cannon that fires a six-pound ball, for example, is called a &quot;six-pounder&quot;. Standard sizes are 6, 12, 18, 24, 32, and 42 pounds; 60-pounders and 68-pounders also exist, along with other nonstandard weapons using the same scheme. Before the introduction of the metric system, countries that produced their own artillery generally used their national pound for these designations. See carronade.

A similar definition, using lead balls, exists for determining the gauge of shotguns and shotgun shells.

<doc id="23317" wikidata="Q2294" url="?curid=23317" title="Proton">
<text>A proton is a stable subatomic particle, symbol , H+, or 1H+ with a positive electric charge of +1 &quot;e&quot; (elementary charge). Its mass is slightly less than the mass of a neutron and approximately times the mass of an electron (the proton-to-electron mass ratio). Protons and neutrons, each with a mass of approximately one atomic mass unit, are jointly referred to as &quot;nucleons&quot; (particles present in atomic nuclei).

One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They provide the attractive electrostatic central force which binds the atomic electrons. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol &quot;Z&quot;). Since each element is identified by the number of protons in its nucleus, each element has its own atomic number, which determines the number of atomic electrons and consequently the chemical characteristics of the element.

The word &quot;proton&quot; is Greek for &quot;first&quot;, and the name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental or elementary particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.

Although protons were originally considered to be elementary particles, in the modern Standard Model of particle physics, protons are known to be composite particles, containing three valence quarks, and together with neutrons are now classified as hadrons. Protons are composed of two up quarks of charge +&quot;e&quot; each, and one down quark of charge −&quot;e&quot;. The rest masses of quarks contribute only about 1% of a proton&#x27;s mass. The remainder of a proton&#x27;s mass is due to quantum chromodynamics binding energy, which includes the kinetic energy of the quarks and the energy of the gluon fields that bind the quarks together. The root mean square charge radius of a proton is about 0.84–0.87 fm ( = ). In 2019, two different studies, using different techniques, found this radius to be 0.833 fm, with an uncertainty of ±0.010 fm.

Free protons occur occasionally on Earth: thunderstorms can produce protons with energies of up to several tens of MeV. At sufficiently low temperatures and kinetic energies, free protons will bind to electrons. However, the character of such bound protons does not change, and they remain protons. A fast proton moving through matter will slow by interactions with electrons and nuclei, until it is captured by the electron cloud of an atom. The result is a diatomic or polyatomic ion containing hydrogen. In a vacuum, when free electrons are present, a sufficiently slow proton may pick up a single free electron, becoming a neutral hydrogen atom, which is chemically a free radical. Such &quot;free hydrogen atoms&quot; tend to react chemically with many other types of atoms at sufficiently low energies. When free hydrogen atoms react with each other, they form neutral hydrogen molecules (H2), which are the most common molecular component of molecular clouds in interstellar space.

Free protons are routinely used for accelerators for proton therapy or various particle physics experiments, with the most powerful example being the Large Hadron Collider.

== Description ==
Protons are spin- fermions and are composed of three valence quarks, making them baryons (a sub-type of hadrons). The two up quarks and one down quark of a proton are held together by the strong force, mediated by gluons. A modern perspective has a proton composed of the valence quarks (up, up, down), the gluons, and transitory pairs of sea quarks. Protons have a positive charge distribution, which decays approximately exponentially, with a root mean square charge radius of about 0.8 fm.

Protons and neutrons are both nucleons, which may be bound together by the nuclear force to form atomic nuclei. The nucleus of the most common isotope of the hydrogen atom (with the chemical symbol &quot;H&quot;) is a lone proton. The nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons, respectively. All other types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers of neutrons.

== History ==
The concept of a hydrogen-like particle as a constituent of other atoms was developed over a long period. As early as 1815, William Prout proposed that all atoms are composed of hydrogen atoms (which he called &quot;protyles&quot;), based on a simplistic interpretation of early values of atomic weights (see Prout&#x27;s hypothesis), which was disproved when more accurate values were measured.
In 1886, Eugen Goldstein discovered canal rays (also known as anode rays) and showed that they were positively charged particles (ions) produced from gases. However, since particles from different gases had different values of charge-to-mass ratio (&quot;q&quot;/&quot;m&quot;), they could not be identified with a single particle, unlike the negative electrons discovered by J. J. Thomson. Wilhelm Wien in 1898 identified the hydrogen ion as the particle with the highest charge-to-mass ratio in ionized gases.

Following the discovery of the atomic nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1911, Antonius van den Broek proposed that the place of each element in the periodic table (its atomic number) is equal to its nuclear charge. This was confirmed experimentally by Henry Moseley in 1913 using X-ray spectra (More details in Atomic number under Moseley&#x27;s 1913 experiment).

In 1917, Rutherford performed experiments (reported in 1919 and 1925) which proved that the hydrogen nucleus is present in other nuclei, a result usually described as the discovery of protons. These experiments began after Rutherford observed that when alpha particles would strike air, Rutherford could detect scintillation on a zinc sulfide screen produced at a distance well beyond the distance of alpha-particle range of travel but instead corresponding to the range of travel of hydrogen atoms (protons). After experimentation, Rutherford traced the reaction to the nitrogen in air and found that when alpha particles were introduced into pure nitrogen gas, the effect was larger. In 1919, Rutherford assumed that the alpha particle merely knocked a proton out of nitrogen, turning it into carbon. After observing Blackett&#x27;s cloud chamber images in 1925, Rutherford realized that the alpha particle was absorbed. If the alpha particle were not absorbed, then it would knock a proton off of nitrogen creating 3 charged particles (a negatively charged carbon, a proton, and an alpha particle). It can be shown that the 3 charged particles would create three tracks in the cloud chamber, but instead only 2 tracks in the cloud chamber were observed. The alpha particle is absorbed by the nitrogen atom. After capture of the alpha particle, a hydrogen nucleus is ejected, creating a net result of 2 charged particles (a proton and a positively charged oxygen) which make 2 tracks in the cloud chamber. Heavy oxygen (17O), not carbon or fluorine, is the product. This was the first reported nuclear reaction, . Rutherford at first thought of our modern &quot;p&quot; in this equation as a hydrogen ion, .

Depending on one&#x27;s perspective, either 1919 (when it was seen experimentally as derived from another source than hydrogen) or 1920 (when it was recognized and proposed as an elementary particle) may be regarded as the moment when the proton was &#x27;discovered&#x27;.

Rutherford knew hydrogen to be the simplest and lightest element and was influenced by Prout&#x27;s hypothesis that hydrogen was the building block of all elements. Discovery that the hydrogen nucleus is present in other nuclei as an elementary particle led Rutherford to give the hydrogen nucleus a special name as a particle, since he suspected that hydrogen, the lightest element, contained only one of these particles. He named this new fundamental building block of the nucleus the &quot;proton&quot;, after the neuter singular of the Greek word for &quot;first&quot;, . However, Rutherford also had in mind the word &quot;protyle&quot; as used by Prout. Rutherford spoke at the British Association for the Advancement of Science at its Cardiff meeting beginning 24 August 1920. At the meeting, he was asked by Oliver Lodge for a new name for the positive hydrogen nucleus to avoid confusion with the neutral hydrogen atom. He initially suggested both &quot;proton&quot; and &quot;prouton&quot; (after Prout). Rutherford later reported that the meeting had accepted his suggestion that the hydrogen nucleus be named the &quot;proton&quot;, following Prout&#x27;s word &quot;protyle&quot;. The first use of the word &quot;proton&quot; in the scientific literature appeared in 1920.

==Occurrence==
One or more bound protons are present in the nucleus of every atom.
Free protons are found naturally in a number of situations in which energies or temperatures are high enough to separate them from electrons, for which they have some affinity. Free protons exist in plasmas in which temperatures are too high to allow them to combine with electrons. Free protons of high energy and velocity make up 90% of cosmic rays, which propagate through the interstellar medium. Free protons are emitted directly from atomic nuclei in some rare types of radioactive decay. Protons also result (along with electrons and antineutrinos) from the radioactive decay of free neutrons, which are unstable.

== Stability ==
The spontaneous decay of free protons has never been observed, and protons are therefore considered stable particles according to the Standard Model. However, some grand unified theories (GUTs) of particle physics predict that proton decay should take place with lifetimes between 1031 and 1036 years. Experimental searches have established lower bounds on the mean lifetime of a proton for various assumed decay products.

Experiments at the Super-Kamiokande detector in Japan gave lower limits for proton mean lifetime of for decay to an antimuon and a neutral pion, and for decay to a positron and a neutral pion.
Another experiment at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada searched for gamma rays resulting from residual nuclei resulting from the decay of a proton from oxygen-16. This experiment was designed to detect decay to any product, and established a lower limit to a proton lifetime of .

However, protons are known to transform into neutrons through the process of electron capture (also called inverse beta decay). For free protons, this process does not occur spontaneously but only when energy is supplied. The equation is:

The process is reversible; neutrons can convert back to protons through beta decay, a common form of radioactive decay. In fact, a free neutron decays this way, with a mean lifetime of about 15 minutes. A proton can also transform into a neutron through beta plus decay (β+ decay).

According to quantum field theory, the mean proper lifetime of protons formula_1 becomes finite when they are accelerating with proper acceleration formula_2, and formula_1 decreases with increasing formula_2. Acceleration gives rise to a non-vanishing probability for the transition . This was a matter of concern in the later 1990s because formula_1 is a scalar that can be measured by the inertial and coaccelerated observers. In the inertial frame, the accelerating proton should decay according to the formula above. However, according to the coaccelerated observer the proton is at rest and hence should not decay. This puzzle is solved by realizing that in the coaccelerated frame there is a thermal bath due to Fulling–Davies–Unruh effect, an intrinsic effect of quantum field theory. In this thermal bath, experienced by the proton, there are electrons and antineutrinos with which the proton may interact according to the processes: 
# and
Adding the contributions of each of these processes, one should obtain formula_1.

== Quarks and the mass of a proton ==
In quantum chromodynamics, the modern theory of the nuclear force, most of the mass of protons and neutrons is explained by special relativity. The mass of a proton is about 80–100 times greater than the sum of the rest masses of its three valence quarks, while the gluons have zero rest mass. The extra energy of the quarks and gluons in a proton, as compared to the rest energy of the quarks alone in the QCD vacuum, accounts for almost 99% of the proton&#x27;s mass. The rest mass of a proton is, thus, the invariant mass of the system of moving quarks and gluons that make up the particle, and, in such systems, even the energy of massless particles confined to a system is still measured as part of the rest mass of the system.

Two terms are used in referring to the mass of the quarks that make up protons: &quot;current quark mass&quot; refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while &quot;constituent quark mass&quot; refers to the current quark mass plus the mass of the gluon particle field surrounding the quark. These masses typically have very different values. The kinetic energy of the quarks that is a consequence of confinement is a contribution (see &quot;Mass in special relativity&quot;). Using lattice QCD calculations, the contributions to the mass of the proton are the quark condensate (~9%, comprising the up and down quarks and a sea of virtual strange quarks), the quark kinetic energy (~32%), the gluon kinetic energy (~37%), and the anomalous gluonic contribution (~23%, comprising contributions from condensates of all quark flavors).

The constituent quark model wavefunction for the proton is
formula_7

The internal dynamics of protons are complicated, because they are determined by the quarks&#x27; exchanging gluons, and interacting with various vacuum condensates. Lattice QCD provides a way of calculating the mass of a proton directly from the theory to any accuracy, in principle. The most recent calculations claim that the mass is determined to better than 4% accuracy, even to 1% accuracy (see Figure S5 in Dürr &quot;et al.&quot;). These claims are still controversial, because the calculations cannot yet be done with quarks as light as they are in the real world. This means that the predictions are found by a process of extrapolation, which can introduce systematic errors. It is hard to tell whether these errors are controlled properly, because the quantities that are compared to experiment are the masses of the hadrons, which are known in advance.

These recent calculations are performed by massive supercomputers, and, as noted by Boffi and Pasquini: &quot;a detailed description of the nucleon structure is still missing because ... long-distance behavior requires a nonperturbative and/or numerical treatment ...&quot;
More conceptual approaches to the structure of protons are: the topological soliton approach originally due to Tony Skyrme and the more accurate AdS/QCD approach that extends it to include a string theory of gluons, various QCD-inspired models like the bag model and the constituent quark model, which were popular in the 1980s, and the SVZ sum rules, which allow for rough approximate mass calculations. These methods do not have the same accuracy as the more brute-force lattice QCD methods, at least not yet.

== Charge radius ==
The CODATA recommended value of a proton&#x27;s charge radius is The radius of the proton is defined by a formula that can be calculated by quantum electrodynamics and be derived from either atomic spectroscopy or by electron–proton scattering. The formula involves a form-factor related to the two-dimensional parton diameter of the proton.

A value from before 2010 is based on scattering electrons from protons followed by complex calculation involving scattering cross section based on Rosenbluth equation for momentum-transfer cross section), and based on studies of the atomic energy levels of hydrogen and deuterium.
In 2010 an international research team published a proton charge radius measurement via the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen (an exotic atom made of a proton and a negatively charged muon). As a muon is 200 times heavier than an electron, resulting in a smaller atomic orbital, it is much more sensitive to the proton&#x27;s charge radius and thus allows a more precise measurement. Subsequent improved scattering and electron-spectroscopy measurements agree with the new small radius. Work continues to refine and check this new value.

=== Pressure inside the proton ===
Since the proton is composed of quarks confined by gluons, an equivalent pressure that acts on the quarks can be defined. The size of that pressure and other details about it are controversial.

In 2018 this pressure was reported to be on the order 1035 Pa, which is greater than the pressure inside a neutron star. It was said to be maximum at the centre, positive (repulsive) to a radial distance of about 0.6 fm, negative (attractive) at greater distances, and very weak beyond about 2 fm. These numbers were derived by a combination of a theoretical model and experimental 
Compton scattering of high-energy electrons. However, these results have been challenged as also being consistent with zero pressure and as effectively providing the pressure profile shape by selection of the model.

=== Charge radius in solvated proton, hydronium ===
The radius of the hydrated proton appears in the Born equation for calculating the hydration enthalpy of hydronium.

== Interaction of free protons with ordinary matter ==
Although protons have affinity for oppositely charged electrons, this is a relatively low-energy interaction and so free protons must lose sufficient velocity (and kinetic energy) in order to become closely associated and bound to electrons. High energy protons, in traversing ordinary matter, lose energy by collisions with atomic nuclei, and by ionization of atoms (removing electrons) until they are slowed sufficiently to be captured by the electron cloud in a normal atom.

However, in such an association with an electron, the character of the bound proton is not changed, and it remains a proton. The attraction of low-energy free protons to any electrons present in normal matter (such as the electrons in normal atoms) causes free protons to stop and to form a new chemical bond with an atom. Such a bond happens at any sufficiently &quot;cold&quot; temperature (that is, comparable to temperatures at the surface of the Sun) and with any type of atom. Thus, in interaction with any type of normal (non-plasma) matter, low-velocity free protons do not remain free but are attracted to electrons in any atom or molecule with which they come into contact, causing the proton and molecule to combine. Such molecules are then said to be &quot;protonated&quot;, and chemically they are simply compounds of hydrogen, often positively charged. Often, as a result, they become so-called Brønsted acids. For example, a proton captured by a water molecule in water becomes hydronium, the aqueous cation .

== Proton in chemistry ==

=== Atomic number ===
In chemistry, the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is known as the atomic number, which determines the chemical element to which the atom belongs. For example, the atomic number of chlorine is 17; this means that each chlorine atom has 17 protons and that all atoms with 17 protons are chlorine atoms. The chemical properties of each atom are determined by the number of (negatively charged) electrons, which for neutral atoms is equal to the number of (positive) protons so that the total charge is zero. For example, a neutral chlorine atom has 17 protons and 17 electrons, whereas a Cl− anion has 17 protons and 18 electrons for a total charge of −1.

All atoms of a given element are not necessarily identical, however. The number of neutrons may vary to form different isotopes, and energy levels may differ, resulting in different nuclear isomers. For example, there are two stable isotopes of chlorine: with 35 − 17 = 18 neutrons and with 37 − 17 = 20 neutrons.

=== Hydrogen ion ===


In chemistry, the term &quot;proton&quot; refers to the hydrogen ion, . Since the atomic number of hydrogen is 1, a hydrogen ion has no electrons and corresponds to a bare nucleus, consisting of a proton (and 0 neutrons for the most abundant isotope &quot;protium&quot; ). The proton is a &quot;bare charge&quot; with only about 1/64,000 of the radius of a hydrogen atom, and so is extremely reactive chemically. The free proton, thus, has an extremely short lifetime in chemical systems such as liquids and it reacts immediately with the electron cloud of any available molecule. In aqueous solution, it forms the hydronium ion, H3O+, which in turn is further solvated by water molecules in clusters such as [H5O2]+ and [H9O4]+.

The transfer of in an acid–base reaction is usually referred to as &quot;proton transfer&quot;. The acid is referred to as a proton donor and the base as a proton acceptor. Likewise, biochemical terms such as &quot;proton pump&quot; and &quot;proton channel&quot; refer to the movement of hydrated ions.

The ion produced by removing the electron from a deuterium atom is known as a &quot;deuteron&quot;, not a proton. Likewise, removing an electron from a tritium atom produces a &quot;triton&quot;.

=== Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) ===
Also in chemistry, the term &quot;proton NMR&quot; refers to the observation of hydrogen-1 nuclei in (mostly organic) molecules by nuclear magnetic resonance. This method uses the quantized spin magnetic moment of the proton, which is due to its angular momentum (or spin), which in turn has a magnitude of one-half the reduced Planck constant. (formula_8). The name refers to examination of protons as they occur in protium (hydrogen-1 atoms) in compounds, and does not imply that free protons exist in the compound being studied.

== Human exposure ==

The Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages (ALSEP) determined that more than 95% of the particles in the solar wind are electrons and protons, in approximately equal numbers.

Protons also have extrasolar origin from galactic cosmic rays, where they make up about 90% of the total particle flux. These protons often have higher energy than solar wind protons, and their intensity is far more uniform and less variable than protons coming from the Sun, the production of which is heavily affected by solar proton events such as coronal mass ejections.

Research has been performed on the dose-rate effects of protons, as typically found in space travel, on human health. To be more specific, there are hopes to identify what specific chromosomes are damaged, and to define the damage, during cancer development from proton exposure. Another study looks into determining &quot;the effects of exposure to proton irradiation on neurochemical and behavioral endpoints, including dopaminergic functioning, amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion learning, and spatial learning and memory as measured by the Morris water maze. Electrical charging of a spacecraft due to interplanetary proton bombardment has also been proposed for study. There are many more studies that pertain to space travel, including galactic cosmic rays and their possible health effects, and solar proton event exposure.

The American Biostack and Soviet Biorack space travel experiments have demonstrated the severity of molecular damage induced by heavy ions on microorganisms including Artemia cysts.

== Antiproton ==

CPT-symmetry puts strong constraints on the relative properties of particles and antiparticles and, therefore, is open to stringent tests. For example, the charges of a proton and antiproton must sum to exactly zero. This equality has been tested to one part in . The equality of their masses has also been tested to better than one part in . By holding antiprotons in a Penning trap, the equality of the charge-to-mass ratio of protons and antiprotons has been tested to one part in . The magnetic moment of antiprotons has been measured with an error of nuclear Bohr magnetons, and is found to be equal and opposite to that of a proton.

<text>Phosphorus is a chemical element with the symbol P and the atomic number 15. Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms, white phosphorus and red phosphorus, but because it is highly reactive, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth. It has an occurrence in the Earth&#x27;s crust of about 0.1%, generally occurring as phosphate in minerals.

Elemental phosphorus was first isolated as white phosphorus in 1669 by Hennig Brand and marked the first &quot;discovery&quot; of an element not known since Antiquity. The name phosphorus is a reference to the god of the Morning star in Greek mythology, inspired by the faint glow of white phosphorus when exposed to oxygen. This property is also at the origin of the term &quot;phosphorescence&quot;, meaning glow after illumination, although white phosphorus itself does not exhibit phosphorescence, but chemiluminescence caused by its oxidation. Phosphorus is a member of the pnictogens, together with nitrogen, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and moscovium, and consequently shares properties with them.

Phosphorus is an element essential to sustaining life largely through phosphates, compounds containing the phosphate ion, . Phosphates are a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids, complex compounds fundamental to cells. Elemental phosphorus was first isolated from human urine, and bone ash was an important early phosphate source. Phosphate mines contain fossils because phosphate is present in the fossilized deposits of animal remains and excreta. Low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in a number of plant ecosystems. The vast majority of phosphorus compounds mined are consumed as fertilisers. Phosphate is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil, and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population. Other applications include organophosphorus compounds in detergents, pesticides, and nerve agents.

==History==
===Discovery===

Phosphorus was the first element to be &quot;discovered&quot;, in the sense that it was not known since ancient times. The discovery is credited to the Hamburg alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669, who was attempting to create the fabled philosopher&#x27;s stone. To this end, he experimented with urine, which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism. By letting the urine rot (a step later discovered to be unnecessary), boiling it down to a paste, then distillating it at a high temperature and leading the resulting vapours through water, he obtained a white, waxy substance that glowed in the dark and burned brilliantly. He named it in . The word phosphorus itself () originates from Greek mythology, where it references the god of the morning star, also known as the planet Venus.

Brand at first tried to keep the method secret, but later sold the recipe for 200 thalers to from Dresden. Kraft toured much of Europe with it, including England, where he met with Robert Boyle. The crucial fact that the substance was made from urine was eventually found out, and Johann Kunckel was able to reproduce it in Sweden in 1678. In 1680, Boyle also managed to make phosphorus in London, and published the method of its manufacture. He was the first to use phosphorus to ignite sulfur-tipped wooden splints, forerunners of modern matches, and also improved the process by using sand in the reaction:
Boyle&#x27;s assistant Ambrose Godfrey-Hanckwitz later made a business of the manufacture of phosphorus.

===Bone ash===
Antoine Lavoisier recognized phosphorus as an element in 1777 after Johan Gottlieb Gahn and Carl Wilhelm Scheele showed in 1769 that calcium phosphate is found in bones by obtaining elemental phosphorus from bone ash. Bone ash subsequently became the primary industrial source of phosphorus and remained so until the 1840s. The process consisted of several steps. First, grinding up the bones into their constituent tricalcium phosphate and treating it with sulfuric acid:
Then, dehydrating the resulting monocalcium phosphate:
Finally, mixing the obtained calcium metaphosphate with ground coal or charcoal in an iron pot, and distilling phosphorus vapour out of a retort:
This way, two-thirds of the phosphorus was turned into white phosphorus while one-third remained in the residue as calcium orthophosphate. The carbon monoxide produced during the reaction process was burnt off in a flare stack.

===Guano===


In 1609 Inca Garcilaso de la Vega wrote the book &quot;Comentarios Reales&quot; in which he described many of the agricultural practices of the Incas prior to the arrival of the Spaniards and introduced the use of guano as a fertilizer. As Garcilaso described, the Incas near the coast harvested guano. In the early 1800s Alexander von Humboldt introduced guano as a source of agricultural fertilizer to Europe after having discovered it in exploitable quantities on islands off the coast of South America. It has been reported that, at the time of its discovery, the guano on some islands was over deep. The guano had previously been used by the Moche people as a source of fertilizer by mining it and transporting it back to Peru by boat. International commerce in guano did not start until after 1840. By the start of the 20th century guano had been nearly completely depleted and was eventually overtaken with the discovery of methods of production of superphosphate.

===Matches===

Early matches used white phosphorus in their composition, which was dangerous due to its toxicity. Exposure to the vapours gave match workers a severe necrosis of the bones of the jaw, known as &quot;phossy jaw&quot;. When a safe process for manufacturing red phosphorus was discovered, with its far lower flammability and toxicity, laws were enacted, under the Berne Convention (1906), requiring its adoption as a safer alternative for match manufacture. The toxicity of white phosphorus led to discontinuation of its use in matches.

===Phosphate rock===

Phosphate rock, which usually contains calcium phosphate, was first used in 1850 to make phosphorus. With the introduction of the submerged-arc furnace for phosphorus production by James Burgess Readman in 1888 (patented 1889), the use of bone-ash became obsolete. After the depletion of world guano sources about the same time, mineral phosphates became the major source of phosphate fertiliser production. Phosphate rock production greatly increased after World War II, and remains the primary global source of phosphorus and phosphorus chemicals today. Phosphate rock remains a feedstock in the fertiliser industry, where it is treated with sulfuric acid to produce various &quot;superphosphate&quot; fertiliser products.

===Incendiaries===
The electric furnace method allowed production to increase to the point where white phosphorus could be used in weapons of war. In World War I, it was used in incendiary ammunition, smoke screens and tracer ammunition. A special incendiary bullet was developed to shoot at hydrogen-filled Zeppelins over Britain (hydrogen being highly flammable).

During World War II, Molotov cocktails made of phosphorus dissolved in petrol were distributed in Britain to specially selected civilians as part of the preparations for a potential invasion. The United States also developed the M15 white-phosphorus hand grenade, a precursor to the M34 grenade, while the British introduced the similar No 77 grenade. These multipurpose grenades were mostly used for signaling and smoke screens, although they were also efficient anti-personnel weapons. The difficulty to extinguish burning phosphorus and the very severe burns it causes had a strong psychological impact on the enemy. Phosphorus incendiary bombs were used on a large scale, notably to destroy Hamburg, the place where the &quot;miraculous bearer of light&quot; was first discovered.

==Characteristics==
===Isotopes===

There are 22 known isotopes of phosphorus, ranging from to . Only is stable and is therefore present at 100% abundance. The half-integer nuclear spin and high abundance of 31P make phosphorus-31 NMR spectroscopy a very useful analytical tool in studies of phosphorus-containing samples.

Two radioactive isotopes of phosphorus have half-lives suitable for biological scientific experiments, and are used as radioactive tracers in biochemical laboratories. These are:
* , a beta-emitter (1.71 MeV) with a half-life of 14.3 days, which is used routinely in life-science laboratories, primarily to produce radiolabeled DNA and RNA probes, e.g. for use in Northern blots or Southern blots. 
* , a beta-emitter (0.25 MeV) with a half-life of 25.4 days. It is used in life-science laboratories in applications in which lower energy beta emissions are advantageous such as DNA sequencing.
The high-energy beta particles from penetrate skin and corneas and any ingested, inhaled, or absorbed is readily incorporated into bone and nucleic acids. For these reasons, personnel working with is required to wear lab coats, disposable gloves, and safety glasses, and avoid working directly over open containers. Monitoring personal, clothing, and surface contamination is also required. The high energy of the beta particles gives rise to secondary emission of X-rays via Bremsstrahlung (braking radiation) in dense shielding materials such as lead. Therefore, the radiation must be shielded with low density materials such as water, acrylic or other plastic.

===Allotropes===
Phosphorus has several allotropes that exhibit very diverse properties. The most useful and therefore common is white phosphorus, followed by red phosphorus. The two other main allotropes, violet and black phosphorus, have either a more fundamental interest or specialized applications. Many other allotropes have been theorized and synthesized, with the search for new materials an active area of research. Commonly mentioned &quot;yellow phosphorus&quot; is not an allotrope, but a result of the gradual degradation of white phosphorus into red phosphorus, accelerated by light and heat. This causes white phosphorus that is aged or otherwise impure (e.g. weapons-grade) to appear yellow.

====White phosphorus====
White phosphorus faintly glows green and blue due to oxidation when exposed to air, a phenomenon best visible in the dark. This reaction with oxygen takes place at the surface of the solid (or liquid) phosphorus, forming the short-lived molecules and that both emit visible light. However, in a pure-oxygen environment phosphorus does not glow at all, with the oxidation happening only in a range of partial pressures. Derived from this phenomenon, the terms &quot;phosphors&quot; and &quot;phosphorescence&quot; have been loosely used to describe substances that shine in the dark. However, phosphorus itself is not phosphorescent but chemiluminescent, since it glows due to a chemical reaction and not the progressive reemission of previously absorbed light.

White phosphorus is a soft, waxy molecular solid that is insoluble in water. It is also very toxic, highly flammable and pyrophoric, igniting at about . White phosphorus is composed of tetrahedra. The nature of bonding in a given tetrahedron can be described by spherical aromaticity or cluster bonding, that is the electrons are highly delocalized. This has been illustrated by calculations of the magnetically induced currents, which sum up to 29 nA/T, much more than in the archetypical aromatic molecule benzene (11 nA/T). The molecule in the gas phase has a P-P bond length of &quot;r&quot;g = 2.1994(3) Å as was determined by gas electron diffraction.

White phosphorus exists in two crystalline forms: α (alpha) and β (beta). The α-form is most stable at room temperature and has a cubic crystal structure. When cooled down to and below it transforms into the β-form, turning into an hexagonal crystal structure. These forms differ in terms of the relative orientations of the constituent tetrahedra. When heated up, the tetrahedral structure is conserved in liquid and gaseous state, before encountering thermal decomposition at into gaseous diphosphorus (). This molecule contains a triple bond and is analogous to ; it can also be generated as a transient intermediate in solution by thermolysis of organophosphorus precursor reagents. At still higher temperatures, dissociates into atomic P.

====Red phosphorus====
Red phosphorus is polymeric in structure. It can be viewed as a derivative of wherein one P-P bond is broken and one additional bond is formed with the neighbouring tetrahedron, resulting in chains of molecules linked by van der Waals forces. Red phosphorus may be formed by heating white phosphorus to or by exposing white phosphorus to sunlight. Phosphorus after this treatment is amorphous, before crystallising upon further heating. In this sense, red phosphorus is technically not an allotrope, but rather an intermediate phase between white and violet phosphorus, and consequently most of its properties have a range of values. Freshly prepared, bright red phosphorus is highly reactive and ignites at about . After prolonged heating or storage, the color darkens; the resulting product is more stable and does not spontaneously ignite in air.

====Violet phosphorus====
Violet phosphorus or α-metallic phosphorus can be produced by day-long annealing of red phosphorus above . In 1865, Johann Wilhelm Hittorf discovered that when phosphorus was recrystallised from molten lead, a red/purple form is obtained. Therefore, this form is sometimes known as &quot;Hittorf&#x27;s phosphorus&quot; .

====Black phosphorus====
Black phosphorus or β-metallic phosphorus is the least reactive allotrope and the thermodynamically stable form below . In appearance, properties, and structure, it resembles graphite, being black and flaky, a conductor of electricity, and having puckered sheets of linked atoms. It is obtained by heating white phosphorus under high pressures (about ). It can also be produced at ambient conditions using metal salts, e.g. mercury, as catalysts. Single-layer black phosphorus is called phosphorene, and is therefore predictably analogous to graphene.

==Compounds==
===Phosphorus(V)===

The most prevalent compounds of phosphorus are derivatives of phosphate (PO43−), a tetrahedral anion. Phosphate is the conjugate base of phosphoric acid, which is produced on a massive scale for use in fertilisers. Being triprotic, phosphoric acid converts stepwise to three conjugate bases:
:H3PO4 + H2O H3O+ + H2PO4−       &quot;K&quot;a1 = 7.25×10−3

:H2PO4− + H2O H3O+ + HPO42−       &quot;K&quot;a2 = 6.31×10−8

:HPO42− + H2O H3O+ +  PO43−        &quot;K&quot;a3 = 3.98×10−13

Phosphate exhibits a tendency to form chains and rings containing P-O-P bonds. Many polyphosphates are known, including ATP. Polyphosphates arise by dehydration of hydrogen phosphates such as HPO42− and H2PO4−. For example, the industrially important pentasodium triphosphate (also known as sodium tripolyphosphate, STPP) is produced industrially by the megatonne by this condensation reaction:
:2 Na2HPO4 + NaH2PO4 → Na5P3O10 + 2 H2O
Phosphorus pentoxide (P4O10) is the acid anhydride of phosphoric acid, but several intermediates between the two are known. This waxy white solid reacts vigorously with water.

With metal cations, phosphate forms a variety of salts. These solids are polymeric, featuring P-O-M linkages. When the metal cation has a charge of 2+ or 3+, the salts are generally insoluble, hence they exist as common minerals. Many phosphate salts are derived from hydrogen phosphate (HPO42−).

PCl5 and PF5 are common compounds. PF5 is a colourless gas and the molecules have trigonal bipyramidal geometry. PCl5 is a colourless solid which has an ionic formulation of PCl4+ PCl6−, but adopts the trigonal bipyramidal geometry when molten or in the vapour phase. PBr5 is an unstable solid formulated as PBr4+Br−and PI5 is not known. The pentachloride and pentafluoride are Lewis acids. With fluoride, PF5 forms PF6−, an anion that is isoelectronic with SF6. The most important oxyhalide is phosphorus oxychloride, (POCl3), which is approximately tetrahedral.

Before extensive computer calculations were feasible, it was thought that bonding in phosphorus(V) compounds involved &quot;d&quot; orbitals. Computer modeling of molecular orbital theory indicates that this bonding involves only s- and p-orbitals.

===Phosphorus(III)===
All four symmetrical trihalides are well known: gaseous PF3, the yellowish liquids PCl3 and PBr3, and the solid PI3. These materials are moisture sensitive, hydrolysing to give phosphorous acid. The trichloride, a common reagent, is produced by chlorination of white phosphorus:
:P4 + 6 Cl2 → 4 PCl3
The trifluoride is produced from the trichloride by halide exchange. PF3 is toxic because it binds to haemoglobin.

Phosphorus(III) oxide, P4O6 (also called tetraphosphorus hexoxide) is the anhydride of P(OH)3, the minor tautomer of phosphorous acid. The structure of P4O6 is like that of P4O10 without the terminal oxide groups.

Symmetric phosphorus(III) trithioesters (e.g. P(SMe)3) can be produced from the reaction of white phosphorus and the corresponding disulfide, or phosphorus(III) halides and thiolates. Unlike the corresponding esters, they do not undergo a variant of the Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction with electrophiles, instead reverting to another phosphorus(III) compound through a sulfonium intermediate.

===Phosphorus(I) and phosphorus(II)===

These compounds generally feature P–P bonds. Examples include catenated derivatives of phosphine and organophosphines. Compounds containing P=P double bonds have also been observed, although they are rare.

===Phosphides and phosphines===
Phosphides arise by reaction of metals with red phosphorus. The alkali metals (group 1) and alkaline earth metals can form ionic compounds containing the phosphide ion, P3−. These compounds react with water to form phosphine. Other phosphides, for example Na3P7, are known for these reactive metals. With the transition metals as well as the monophosphides there are metal-rich phosphides, which are generally hard refractory compounds with a metallic lustre, and phosphorus-rich phosphides which are less stable and include semiconductors. Schreibersite is a naturally occurring metal-rich phosphide found in meteorites. The structures of the metal-rich and phosphorus-rich phosphides can be complex.

Phosphine (PH3) and its organic derivatives (PR3) are structural analogues of ammonia (NH3), but the bond angles at phosphorus are closer to 90° for phosphine and its organic derivatives. Phosphine is an ill-smelling, toxic gas. Phosphorus has an oxidation number of −3 in phosphine. Phosphine is produced by hydrolysis of calcium phosphide, Ca3P2. Unlike ammonia, phosphine is oxidised by air. Phosphine is also far less basic than ammonia. Other phosphines are known which contain chains of up to nine phosphorus atoms and have the formula P&quot;n&quot;H&quot;n&quot;+2. The highly flammable gas diphosphine (P2H4) is an analogue of hydrazine.

===Oxoacids===
Phosphorus oxoacids are extensive, often commercially important, and sometimes structurally complicated. They all have acidic protons bound to oxygen atoms, some have nonacidic protons that are bonded directly to phosphorus and some contain phosphorus–phosphorus bonds. Although many oxoacids of phosphorus are formed, only nine are commercially important, and three of them, hypophosphorous acid, phosphorous acid, and phosphoric acid, are particularly important.

===Nitrides===
The PN molecule is considered unstable, but is a product of crystalline phosphorus nitride decomposition at 1100 K. Similarly, H2PN is considered unstable, and phosphorus nitride halogens like F2PN, Cl2PN, Br2PN, and I2PN oligomerise into cyclic polyphosphazenes. For example, compounds of the formula (PNCl2)&quot;n&quot; exist mainly as rings such as the trimer hexachlorophosphazene. The phosphazenes arise by treatment of phosphorus pentachloride with ammonium chloride:PCl5 + NH4Cl → 1/&quot;n&quot; (NPCl2)&quot;n&quot; + 4 HClWhen the chloride groups are replaced by alkoxide (RO−), a family of polymers is produced with potentially useful properties.

===Sulfides===

Phosphorus forms a wide range of sulfides, where the phosphorus can be in P(V), P(III) or other oxidation states. The three-fold symmetric P4S3 is used in strike-anywhere matches. P4S10 and P4O10 have analogous structures. Mixed oxyhalides and oxyhydrides of phosphorus(III) are almost unknown.

===Organophosphorus compounds===

Compounds with P-C and P-O-C bonds are often classified as organophosphorus compounds. They are widely used commercially. The PCl3 serves as a source of P3+ in routes to organophosphorus(III) compounds. For example, it is the precursor to triphenylphosphine:
:PCl3 + 6 Na + 3 C6H5Cl → P(C6H5)3 + 6 NaCl
Treatment of phosphorus trihalides with alcohols and phenols gives phosphites, e.g. triphenylphosphite:
:PCl3 + 3 C6H5OH → P(OC6H5)3 + 3 HCl
Similar reactions occur for phosphorus oxychloride, affording triphenylphosphate:
:OPCl3 + 3 C6H5OH → OP(OC6H5)3 + 3 HCl

==Occurrence==
===Universe===
In 2013, astronomers detected phosphorus in Cassiopeia A, which confirmed that this element is produced in supernovae as a byproduct of supernova nucleosynthesis. The phosphorus-to-iron ratio in material from the supernova remnant could be up to 100 times higher than in the Milky Way in general.

In 2020, astronomers analysed ALMA and ROSINA data from the massive star-forming region AFGL 5142, to detect phosphorus-bearing molecules and how they are carried in comets to the early Earth.

===Earth&#x27;s Crust===
Phosphorus has a concentration in the Earth&#x27;s crust of about one gram per kilogram (compare copper at about 0.06 grams). It is not found free in nature, but is widely distributed in many minerals, usually as phosphates. Inorganic phosphate rock, which is partially made of apatite, is today the chief commercial source of this element. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), about 50 percent of the global phosphorus reserves are in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. 85% of Earth&#x27;s known reserves are in Morocco with smaller deposits in China, Russia, Florida, Idaho, Tennessee, Utah, and elsewhere. Albright and Wilson in the UK and their Niagara Falls plant, for instance, were using phosphate rock in the 1890s and 1900s from Tennessee, Florida, and the Îles du Connétable (guano island sources of phosphate); by 1950, they were using phosphate rock mainly from Tennessee and North Africa.

==Production==

===Wet process===
Most phosphorus-bearing material is for agriculture fertilisers. In this case where the standards of purity are modest, phosphorus is obtained from phosphate rock by what is called the &quot;wet process.&quot; The minerals are treated with sulfuric acid to give phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid is then neutralized to give various phosphate salts, which comprise fertilizers. In the wet process, phosphorus does not undergo redox. About five tons of phosphogypsum waste are generated per ton of phosphoric acid production. Annually, the estimated generation of phosphogypsum worldwide is 100 to 280 Mt.

===Thermal process===
For the use of phosphorus in drugs, detergents, and foodstuff, the standards of purity are high, which led to the development of the thermal process. In this process, phosphate minerals are converted to white phosphorus, which can be purified by distillation. The white phosphorus is then oxidised to phosphoric acid and subsequently neutralised with a base to give phosphate salts. The thermal process is conducted in a submerged-arc furnace which is energy intensive. Presently, about of elemental phosphorus is produced annually. Calcium phosphate (as phosphate rock), mostly mined in Florida and North Africa, can be heated to 1,200–1,500 °C with sand, which is mostly , and coke to produce . The product, being volatile, is readily isolated:
: 

Side products from the thermal process include ferrophosphorus, a crude form of , resulting from iron impurities in the mineral precursors. The silicate slag is a useful construction material. The fluoride is sometimes recovered for use in water fluoridation. More problematic is a &quot;mud&quot; containing significant amounts of white phosphorus. Production of white phosphorus is conducted in large facilities in part because it is energy intensive. The white phosphorus is transported in molten form. Some major accidents have occurred during transportation.

===Peak phosphorus===
In 2017, the USGS estimated 68 billion tons of world reserves, where reserve figures refer to the amount assumed recoverable at current market prices; 0.261 billion tons were mined in 2016. Critical to contemporary agriculture, its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population. The production of phosphorus may have peaked before 2011 and some scientists predict reserves will be depleted before the end of the 21st century. Phosphorus comprises about 0.1% by mass of the average rock, and consequently, the Earth&#x27;s supply is vast, though dilute.

Peak phosphorus is a concept to describe the point in time when humanity reaches the maximum global production rate of phosphorus as an industrial and commercial raw material. The term is used in an equivalent way to the better-known term peak oil. The issue was raised as a debate on whether phosphorus shortages might be imminent around 2010, which was largely dismissed after USGS and other organizations increased world estimates on available phosphorus resources, mostly in the form of additional resources in Morocco. However, exact reserve quantities remain uncertain, as do the possible impacts of increased phosphate use on future generations. This is important because rock phosphate is a key ingredient in many inorganic fertilizers. Hence, a shortage in rock phosphate (or just significant price increases) might negatively affect the world&#x27;s food security. 

Phosphorus is a finite (limited) resource that is widespread in the Earth&#x27;s crust and in living organisms but is relatively scarce in concentrated forms, which are not evenly distributed across the Earth. The only cost-effective production method to date is the mining of phosphate rock, but only a few countries have significant commercial reserves. The top five are Morocco (including reserves located in Western Sahara), China, Egypt, Algeria and Syria. Estimates for future production vary significantly depending on modelling and assumptions on extractable volumes, but it is inescapable that future production of phosphate rock will be heavily influenced by Morocco in the foreseeable future.

Means of commercial phosphorus production besides mining are few because the phosphorus cycle does not include significant gas-phase transport. The predominant source of phosphorus in modern times is phosphate rock (as opposed to the guano that preceded it). According to some researchers, Earth&#x27;s commercial and affordable phosphorus reserves are expected to be depleted in 50–100 years and peak phosphorus to be reached in approximately 2030. Others suggest that supplies will last for several hundreds of years. As with the timing of peak oil, the question is not settled, and researchers in different fields regularly publish different estimates of the rock phosphate reserves.

====Background====
The peak phosphorus concept is connected with the concept of planetary boundaries. Phosphorus, as part of biogeochemical processes, belongs to one of the nine &quot;Earth system processes&quot; which are known to have boundaries. As long as the boundaries are not crossed, they mark the &quot;safe zone&quot; for the planet.

====Estimates of world phosphate reserves====
The accurate determination of peak phosphorus is dependent on knowing the total world&#x27;s commercial phosphate reserves and resources, especially in the form of phosphate rock (a summarizing term for over 300 ores of different origin, composition, and phosphate content). &quot;Reserves&quot; refers to the amount assumed recoverable at current market prices and &quot;resources&quot; refers to estimated amounts of such a grade or quality that they have reasonable prospects for economic extraction.

Unprocessed phosphate rock has a concentration of 1.7–8.7% phosphorus by mass (4–20% phosphorus pentoxide). By comparison, the Earth&#x27;s crust contains 0.1% phosphorus by mass, and vegetation 0.03–0.2%. Although quadrillions of tons of phosphorus exist in the Earth&#x27;s crust, these are currently not economically extractable.

US production of phosphate rock peaked in 1980 at 54.4 million metric tons. The United States was the world&#x27;s largest producer of phosphate rock from at least 1900, up until 2006, when US production was exceeded by that of China. In 2019, the US produced 10 percent of the world&#x27;s phosphate rock.

In 2023, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that economically extractable phosphate rock reserves worldwide are 72 billion tons, while world mining production in 2022 was 220 million tons. Assuming zero growth, the reserves would thus last for around 300 years. This broadly confirms a 2010 International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) report that global reserves would last for several hundred years. Phosphorus reserve figures are intensely debated. Gilbert suggest that there has been little external verification of the estimate. A 2014 review concluded that the IFDC report &quot;presents an inflated picture of global reserves, in particular those of Morocco, where largely hypothetical and inferred resources have simply been relabeled “reserves&quot;.

The countries with most phosphate rock commercial reserves (in billion metric tons): Morocco 50, China 3.2, Egypt 2.8, Algeria 2.2, Syria 1.8, Brazil 1.6, Saudi Arabia 1.4, South Africa 1.4, Australia 1.1, United States 1.0, Finland 1.0, Russia 0.6, Jordan 0.8.

Rock phosphate shortages (or just significant price increases) might negatively affect the world&#x27;s food security. Many agricultural systems depend on supplies of inorganic fertilizer, which use rock phosphate. Under the food production regime in developed countries, shortages of rock phosphate could lead to shortages of inorganic fertilizer, which could in turn reduce the global food production.

Economists have pointed out that price fluctuations of rock phosphate do not necessarily indicate peak phosphorus, as these have already occurred due to various demand- and supply-side factors.

===Conservation and recycling===
Reducing agricultural runoff and soil erosion can slow the frequency with which farmers have to reapply phosphorus to their fields. Agricultural methods such as no-till farming, terracing, contour tilling, and the use of windbreaks have been shown to reduce the rate of phosphorus depletion from farmland, though do not completely remove the need for periodic fertilizer application. Strips of grassland or forest between arable land and rivers can also greatly reduce losses of phosphate and other nutrients.

Sewage treatment plants that have a dedicated phosphorus removal step produce phosphate-rich sewage sludge that can then be treated to extract phosphorus from it. This is done by incinerating the sludge and recovering the resulting ash.. Another approach lies into the recovery of phosphorus-rich materials such as struvite from waste processing plants, which is done by adding magnesium to the waste. However, the technologies currently in use are not yet cost-effective, given the current price of phosphorus on the world market.

==Applications==
===Flame retardants and plasticisers===
Phosphorus compounds are used as flame retardants. Some of these, such as Tricresyl phosphate and 2-Ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate, are also plasticisers, making these two properties useful in the production of non-flammable plastic products and derivatives.

===Food additive===
Food-grade phosphoric acid (additive E338) is used to acidify foods and beverages such as various colas and jams, providing a tangy or sour taste. The phosphoric acid also serves as a preservative. Soft drinks containing phosphoric acid, including Coca-Cola, are sometimes called phosphate sodas or phosphates. Phosphoric acid in soft drinks has the potential to cause dental erosion, as well as contribute to the formation of kidney stones, especially in those who have had kidney stones previously. Phosphates are used to improve the characteristics of processed meat and cheese, in baking powder, and in toothpaste.

===Fertiliser===
Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient (the most often limiting nutrient, after nitrogen), and the bulk of all phosphorus production is in concentrated phosphoric acids for agriculture fertilisers, containing as much as 70% to 75% P2O5. That led to large increase in phosphate (PO43−) production in the second half of the 20th century. Artificial phosphate fertilisation is necessary because phosphorus is essential to all living organisms; it is involved in energy transfers, strength of root and stems, photosynthesis, the expansion of plant roots, formation of seeds and flowers, and other important factors effecting overall plant health and genetics. Heavy use of phosphorus fertilizers and their runoff have resulted in eutrophication (overenrichment) of aquatic ecosystems.

Natural phosphorus-bearing compounds are mostly inaccessible to plants because of the low solubility and mobility in soil. Most phosphorus is very stable in the soil minerals or organic matter of the soil. Even when phosphorus is added in manure or fertilizer it can become fixed in the soil. Therefore, the natural phosphorus cycle is very slow. Some of the fixed phosphorus is released again over time, sustaining wild plant growth, however, more is needed to sustain intensive cultivation of crops. Fertiliser is often in the form of superphosphate of lime, a mixture of calcium dihydrogen phosphate (Ca(H2PO4)2), and calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O) produced reacting sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate.

Processing phosphate minerals with sulfuric acid for obtaining fertiliser is so important to the global economy that this is the primary industrial market for sulfuric acid and the greatest industrial use of elemental sulfur.

===Metallurgical aspects===
Phosphorus is also an important component in steel production, in the making of phosphor bronze, and in many other related products. Phosphorus is added to metallic copper during its smelting process to react with oxygen present as an impurity in copper and to produce phosphorus-containing copper (CuOFP) alloys with a higher hydrogen embrittlement resistance than normal copper.
Phosphate conversion coating is a chemical treatment applied to steel parts to improve their corrosion resistance.

===Matches===
The first striking match with a phosphorus head was invented by Charles Sauria in 1830. These matches (and subsequent modifications) were made with heads of white phosphorus, an oxygen-releasing compound (potassium chlorate, lead dioxide, or sometimes nitrate), and a binder. They were poisonous to the workers in manufacture, sensitive to storage conditions, toxic if ingested, and hazardous when accidentally ignited on a rough surface. Production in several countries was banned between 1872 and 1925. The international Berne Convention, ratified in 1906, prohibited the use of white phosphorus in matches.

In consequence, phosphorous matches were gradually replaced by safer alternatives. Around 1900 French chemists Henri Sévène and Emile David Cahen invented the modern strike-anywhere match, wherein the white phosphorus was replaced by phosphorus sesquisulfide (P4S3), a non-toxic and non-pyrophoric compound that ignites under friction. For a time these safer strike-anywhere matches were quite popular but in the long run they were superseded by the modern safety match.

Safety matches are very difficult to ignite on any surface other than a special striker strip. The strip contains non-toxic red phosphorus and the match head potassium chlorate, an oxygen-releasing compound. When struck, small amounts of abrasion from match head and striker strip are mixed intimately to make a small quantity of Armstrong&#x27;s mixture, a very touch sensitive composition. The fine powder ignites immediately and provides the initial spark to set off the match head. Safety matches separate the two components of the ignition mixture until the match is struck. This is the key safety advantage as it prevents accidental ignition. Nonetheless, safety matches, invented in 1844 by Gustaf Erik Pasch and market ready by the 1860s, did not gain consumer acceptance until the prohibition of white phosphorus. Using a dedicated striker strip was considered clumsy.

===Military===
Though military uses of white phosphorus are constrained by modern international law, white phosphorus munitions are still used for military applications, such as incendiary bombs, smoke screens, smoke bombs, and tracer ammunition.

===Pesticides and nerve agents===
While many organic compounds of phosphorus are required for life, some are highly toxic. A wide range of organophosphorus compounds are used for their toxicity as pesticides and weaponised as nerve agents. Some notable examples include sarin, VX or Tabun. Fluorophosphate esters (like sarin) are among the most potent neurotoxins known.

===Water softening===
Sodium triphosphate is used in laundry detergents in some countries, but banned for this use in others. This compound softens the water to enhance the performance of the detergents and to prevent pipe and boiler tube corrosion.

===Drug production===
Phosphorus can reduce elemental iodine to hydroiodic acid, which is a reagent effective for reducing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine. For this reason, red and white phosphorus were designated by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration as List I precursor chemicals under 21 CFR 1310.02 effective on November 17, 2001. In the United States, handlers of red or white phosphorus are subject to stringent regulatory controls.

===Semiconductors===
Phosphorus is a dopant in N-type semiconductors used in high-power electronics and semiconductor detectors. In this context, phosphorus is not present at the start of the process, but rather created directly out of silicon during the manufacture of the devices. This is done by neutron transmutation doping, a method based on the conversion of the  into by neutron capture and beta decay as follows:
formula_1

In practice, the silicon is typically placed near or inside a nuclear reactor generating neutrons. As neutrons pass through the silicon, phosphorus atoms are produced by transmutation. This doping method is far less common than diffusion or ion implantation, but it has the advantage of creating an extremely uniform dopant distribution.

==Biological role==

Inorganic phosphorus in the form of the phosphate is required for all known forms of life. Phosphorus plays a major role in the structural framework of DNA and RNA. Living cells use phosphate to transport cellular energy with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), necessary for every cellular process that uses energy. ATP is also important for phosphorylation, a key regulatory event in cells. Phospholipids are the main structural components of all cellular membranes. Calcium phosphate salts assist in stiffening bones. Biochemists commonly use the abbreviation &quot;P&quot; to refer to inorganic phosphate.

Every living cell is encased in a membrane that separates it from its surroundings. Cellular membranes are composed of a phospholipid matrix and proteins, typically in the form of a bilayer. Phospholipids are derived from glycerol with two of the glycerol hydroxyl (OH) protons replaced by fatty acids as an ester, and the third hydroxyl proton has been replaced with phosphate bonded to another alcohol.

An average adult human contains about of phosphorus, about 85–90% in bones and teeth in the form of apatite, and the remainder in soft tissues and extracellular fluids. The phosphorus content increases from about 0.5% by mass in infancy to 0.65–1.1% by mass in adults. Average phosphorus concentration in the blood is about 0.4 g/L; about 70% of that is organic and 30% inorganic phosphates. An adult with healthy diet consumes and excretes about 1–3 grams of phosphorus per day, with consumption in the form of inorganic phosphate and phosphorus-containing biomolecules such as nucleic acids and phospholipids; and excretion almost exclusively in the form of phosphate ions such as and . Only about 0.1% of body phosphate circulates in the blood, paralleling the amount of phosphate available to soft tissue cells.

===Bone and teeth enamel===
The main component of bone is hydroxyapatite as well as amorphous forms of calcium phosphate, possibly including carbonate. Hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel. Water fluoridation enhances the resistance of teeth to decay by the partial conversion of this mineral to the still harder material fluorapatite:

===Phosphorus deficiency===
In medicine, phosphate deficiency syndrome may be caused by malnutrition, by failure to absorb phosphate, and by metabolic syndromes that draw phosphate from the blood (such as in refeeding syndrome after malnutrition) or passing too much of it into the urine. All are characterised by hypophosphatemia, which is a condition of low levels of soluble phosphate levels in the blood serum and inside the cells. Symptoms of hypophosphatemia include neurological dysfunction and disruption of muscle and blood cells due to lack of ATP. Too much phosphate can lead to diarrhoea and calcification (hardening) of organs and soft tissue, and can interfere with the body&#x27;s ability to use iron, calcium, magnesium, and zinc.

Phosphorus is an essential macromineral for plants, which is studied extensively in edaphology to understand plant uptake from soil systems. Phosphorus is a limiting factor in many ecosystems; that is, the scarcity of phosphorus limits the rate of organism growth. An excess of phosphorus can also be problematic, especially in aquatic systems where eutrophication sometimes leads to algal blooms.

===Nutrition===
The main food sources for phosphorus are the same as those containing protein, although proteins do not contain phosphorus. For example, milk, meat, and soya typically also have phosphorus. As a rule, if a diet has sufficient protein and calcium, the amount of phosphorus is probably sufficient.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for phosphorus in 1997. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead. The current EAR for phosphorus for people ages 19 and up is 580 mg/day. The RDA is 700 mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher-than-average requirements. RDA for pregnancy and lactation are also 700 mg/day. For people ages 1–18 years, the RDA increases with age from 460 to 1250 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of phosphorus, the UL is 4000 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States. For people ages 15 and older, including pregnancy and lactation, the AI is set at 550 mg/day. For children ages 4–10, the AI is 440 mg/day, and for ages 11–17 it is 640 mg/day. These AIs are lower than the U.S. RDAs. In both systems, teenagers need more than adults. EFSA reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was not sufficient information to set a UL.

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For phosphorus labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 1000 mg, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 1250 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.

==Precautions==
===External contact===
Elemental phosphorus poses by far the greatest danger in its white form, red phosphorus being relatively nontoxic. In the past, external exposure to white phosphorus was treated by washing the affected area with 2% copper(II) sulfate solution to form harmless compounds that are then washed away. According to 2009 United States Navy guidelines, &quot;Cupric (copper) sulfate has been used by U.S. personnel in the past and is still being used by some nations. However, copper sulfate is toxic and its use will be discontinued. Copper sulfate may produce kidney and cerebral toxicity as well as intravascular hemolysis.&quot; The manual suggests instead &quot;a bicarbonate solution to neutralise phosphoric acid, which will then allow removal of visible white phosphorus. Particles often can be located by their emission of smoke when air strikes them, or by their phosphorescence in the dark. In dark surroundings, fragments are seen as luminescent spots. Promptly debride the burn if the patient&#x27;s condition will permit removal of bits of WP (white phosphorus) that might be absorbed later and possibly produce systemic poisoning. DO NOT apply oily-based ointments until it is certain that all WP has been removed. Following complete removal of the particles, treat the lesions as thermal burns.&quot;

===Ingestion===
Because of its common use as a rodenticide, there are documented medical reports of white phosphorus ingestion and its effects, especially on children. These cases can present very characteristic symptoms, such as garlic-smelling, smoking and luminescent vomit and stool, the latter sometimes called &quot;Smoking Stool Syndrome&quot;. It is absorbed by both the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory mucosa, to whose it causes serious damage. The acute lethal dose has been estimated at around 1 mg/kg, the very small amount resulting in many cases proving fatal, either because of rapid cardiovascular arrest or through the following systemic toxicity.

===Passive exposure===
Chronic poisoning can lead to necrosis of the jaw. In the United States, exposure to 0.1 mg/m3 of white phosphorus over an 8-hour workday is set as the permissible exposure limit by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and as the recommended exposure limit by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. From 5 mg/m3, it is considered immediately dangerous to life or health.

<doc id="23319" wikidata="Q1089" url="?curid=23319" title="Palladium">
<text>Palladium is a chemical element; it has symbol Pd and atomic number 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1802 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas (formally 2 Pallas), which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs). They have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.

More than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into nontoxic substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor). Palladium is also used in electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applications, groundwater treatment, and jewelry. Palladium is a key component of fuel cells, in which hydrogen and oxygen react to produce electricity, heat, and water.

Ore deposits of palladium and other PGMs are rare. The most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the Bushveld Igneous Complex covering the Transvaal Basin in South Africa; the Stillwater Complex in Montana, United States; the Sudbury Basin and Thunder Bay District of Ontario, Canada; and the Norilsk Complex in Russia. Recycling is also a source, mostly from scrapped catalytic converters. The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest.

==Characteristics==
Palladium belongs to group 10 in the periodic table, but the configuration in the outermost electrons is in accordance with Hund&#x27;s rule. Electrons that by the Madelung rule would be expected to occupy the 5&quot;s&quot; instead fill the 4&quot;d&quot; orbitals, as it is more energetically favorable to have a completely filled 4d10 shell instead of the 5s2 4d8 configuration.
This 5s0 configuration, unique in period 5, makes palladium the heaviest element having only &quot;one&quot; incomplete electron shell, with all shells above it empty.

Palladium has the appearance of a soft silver-white metal that resembles platinum. It is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid, in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, and when finely ground, in hydrochloric acid. It dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia.

Palladium does not react with oxygen at standard temperature (and thus does not tarnish in air). Palladium heated to 800 °C will produce a layer of palladium(II) oxide (PdO). It may slowly develop a slight brownish coloration over time, likely due to the formation of a surface layer of its monoxide.

Palladium films with defects produced by alpha particle bombardment at low temperature exhibit superconductivity having &quot;T&quot;c = 3.2 K.

===Isotopes===

Naturally occurring palladium is composed of seven isotopes, six of which are stable. The most stable radioisotopes are 107Pd with a half-life of 6.5 million years (found in nature), 103Pd with 17 days, and 100Pd with 3.63 days. Eighteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from 90.94948(64) u (91Pd) to 122.93426(64) u (123Pd). These have half-lives of less than thirty minutes, except 101Pd (half-life: 8.47 hours), 109Pd (half-life: 13.7 hours), and 112Pd (half-life: 21 hours).

For isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope, 106Pd, the primary decay mode is electron capture with the primary decay product being rhodium. The primary mode of decay for those isotopes of Pd with atomic mass greater than 106 is beta decay with the primary product of this decay being silver.

Radiogenic 107Ag is a decay product of 107Pd and was first discovered in 1978 in the Santa Clara meteorite of 1976. The discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of iron-cored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a nucleosynthetic event. 107Pd versus Ag correlations observed in bodies, which have been melted since accretion of the Solar System, must reflect the presence of short-lived nuclides in the early Solar System. is also produced as a fission product in spontaneous or induced fission of . As it is not very mobile in the environment and has a relatively low decay energy, is usually considered to be among the less concerning of the long-lived fission products.

==Compounds==

Palladium compounds exist primarily in the 0 and +2 oxidation state. Other less common states are also recognized. Generally the compounds of palladium are more similar to those of platinum than those of any other element.
===Palladium(II)===
Palladium(II) chloride is the principal starting material for other palladium compounds. It arises by the reaction of palladium with chlorine. It is used to prepare heterogeneous palladium catalysts such as palladium on barium sulfate, palladium on carbon, and palladium chloride on carbon. Solutions of PdCl2 in nitric acid react with acetic acid to give palladium(II) acetate, also a versatile reagent. PdCl2 reacts with ligands (L) to give square planar complexes of the type PdCl2L2. One example of such complexes is the benzonitrile derivative PdCl2(PhCN)2.

The complex bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride is a useful catalyst.

===Palladium(0)===
Palladium forms a range of zerovalent complexes with the formula PdL4, PdL3 and PdL2. For example, reduction of a mixture of PdCl2(PPh3)2 and PPh3 gives tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0):

Another major palladium(0) complex, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3), is prepared by reducing sodium tetrachloropalladate in the presence of dibenzylideneacetone.

Palladium(0), as well as palladium(II), are catalysts in coupling reactions, as has been recognized by the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Richard F. Heck, Ei-ichi Negishi, and Akira Suzuki. Such reactions are widely practiced for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Prominent coupling reactions include the Heck, Suzuki, Sonogashira coupling, Stille reactions, and the Kumada coupling. Palladium(II) acetate, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4), and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) serve either as catalysts or precatalysts.

===Other oxidation states===
Although Pd(IV) compounds are comparatively rare, one example is sodium hexachloropalladate(IV), Na2[PdCl6]. A few compounds of palladium(III) are also known. Palladium(VI) was claimed in 2002, but subsequently disproven.

Mixed valence palladium complexes exist, e.g. Pd4(CO)4(OAc)4Pd(acac)2 forms an infinite Pd chain structure, with alternatively interconnected Pd4(CO)4(OAc)4 and Pd(acac)2 units.

When alloyed with a more electropositive element, palladium can acquire a negative charge. Such compounds are known as palladides, such as gallium palladide. Palladides with the stoichiometry RPd3 exist where R is scandium, yttrium, or any of the lanthanides.

==Occurrence==

As overall mine production of palladium reached 210,000 kilograms in 2022, Russia was the top producer with 88,000 kilograms, followed by South Africa, Canada, the U.S., and Zimbabwe. Russia&#x27;s company Norilsk Nickel ranks first among the largest palladium producers globally, accounting for 39% of the world&#x27;s production. 

Palladium can be found as a free metal alloyed with gold and other platinum-group metals in placer deposits of the Ural Mountains, Australia, Ethiopia, North and South America. For the production of palladium, these deposits play only a minor role. The most important commercial sources are nickel-copper deposits found in the Sudbury Basin, Ontario, and the Norilsk–Talnakh deposits in Siberia. The other large deposit is the Merensky Reef platinum group metals deposit within the Bushveld Igneous Complex South Africa. The Stillwater igneous complex of Montana and the Roby zone ore body of the Lac des Îles igneous complex of Ontario are the two other sources of palladium in Canada and the United States. Palladium is found in the rare minerals cooperite and polarite. Many more Pd minerals are known, but all of them are very rare.

Palladium is also produced in nuclear fission reactors and can be extracted from spent nuclear fuel (see synthesis of precious metals), though this source for palladium is not used. None of the existing nuclear reprocessing facilities are equipped to extract palladium from the high-level radioactive waste. A complication for the recovery of palladium in spent fuel is the presence of , a slightly radioactive long-lived fission product. Depending on end use, the radioactivity contributed by the might make the recovered palladium unusable without a costly step of isotope separation.

==Applications==
The largest use of palladium today is in catalytic converters. Palladium is also used in jewelry, dentistry, watch making, blood sugar test strips, aircraft spark plugs, surgical instruments, and electrical contacts. Palladium is also used to make some professional transverse (concert or classical) flutes. As a commodity, palladium bullion has ISO currency codes of XPD and 964. Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes, the others being gold, silver and platinum. Because it adsorbs hydrogen, palladium was a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments of the late 1980s.

===Catalysis===

When it is finely divided, as with palladium on carbon, palladium forms a versatile catalyst; it speeds heterogeneous catalytic processes like hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and petroleum cracking. Palladium is also essential to the Lindlar catalyst, also called Lindlar&#x27;s Palladium. A large number of carbon–carbon bonding reactions in organic chemistry are facilitated by palladium compound catalysts. For example:
* Heck reaction
* Suzuki coupling
* Tsuji-Trost reactions
* Wacker process
* Negishi reaction
* Stille coupling
* Sonogashira coupling

When dispersed on conductive materials, palladium is an excellent electrocatalyst for oxidation of primary alcohols in alkaline media. Palladium is also a versatile metal for homogeneous catalysis, used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations.

In 2010 the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded &quot;for palladium-catalyzed cross couplings in organic synthesis&quot; to Richard F. Heck, Ei-ichi Negishi and Akira Suzuki. A 2008 study showed that palladium is an effective catalyst for carbon–fluorine bonds.
Palladium catalysis is primarily employed in organic chemistry and industrial applications, although its use is growing as a tool for synthetic biology; in 2017, effective &quot;in vivo&quot; catalytic activity of palladium nanoparticles was demonstrated in mammals to treat disease.

===Electronics===
The primary application of palladium in electronics is in multi-layer ceramic capacitors in which palladium (and palladium-silver alloy) is used for electrodes. Palladium (sometimes alloyed with nickel) is or can be used for component and connector plating in consumer electronics and in soldering materials. The electronic sector consumed of palladium in 2006, according to a Johnson Matthey report.

===Technology===
Hydrogen easily diffuses through heated palladium, and membrane reactors with Pd membranes are used in the production of high purity hydrogen. Palladium is used in palladium-hydrogen electrodes in electrochemical studies. Palladium(II) chloride readily catalyzes carbon monoxide gas to carbon dioxide and is useful in carbon monoxide detectors.

===Hydrogen storage===

Palladium readily adsorbs hydrogen at room temperatures, forming palladium hydride PdHx with x less than 1. While this property is common to many transition metals, palladium has a uniquely high absorption capacity and does not lose its ductility until x approaches 1. This property has been investigated in designing an efficient and safe hydrogen fuel storage medium, though palladium itself is currently prohibitively expensive for this purpose. The content of hydrogen in palladium can be linked to magnetic susceptibility, which decreases with the increase of hydrogen and becomes zero for PdH0.62. At any higher ratio, the solid solution becomes diamagnetic.

Palladium is used for purification of hydrogen on a laboratory but not industrial scale.

===Dentistry===
Palladium is used in small amounts (about 0.5%) in some alloys of dental amalgam to decrease corrosion and increase the metallic lustre of the final restoration.

===Jewelry===
Palladium has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since 1939 as an alternative to platinum in the alloys called &quot;white gold&quot;, where the naturally white color of palladium does not require rhodium plating. Palladium, being much less dense than platinum, is similar to gold in that it can be beaten into leaf as thin as 100 nm ( in). Unlike platinum, palladium may discolor at temperatures above due to oxidation, making it more brittle and thus less suitable for use in jewelry; to prevent this, palladium intended for jewelry is heated under controlled conditions.

Prior to 2004, the principal use of palladium in jewelry was the manufacture of white gold. Palladium is one of the three most popular alloying metals in white gold (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is more expensive than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).

When platinum became a strategic resource during World War II, many jewelry bands were made out of palladium. Palladium was little used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty of casting. With the casting problem resolved the use of palladium in jewelry increased, originally because platinum increased in price while the price of palladium decreased. In early 2004, when gold and platinum prices rose steeply, China began fabricating volumes of palladium jewelry, consuming 37 tonnes in 2005. Subsequent changes in the relative price of platinum lowered demand for palladium to 17.4 tonnes in 2009. Demand for palladium as a catalyst has increased the price of palladium to about 50% higher than that of platinum in January 2019.

In January 2010, hallmarks for palladium were introduced by assay offices in the United Kingdom, and hallmarking became mandatory for all jewelry advertising pure or alloyed palladium. Articles can be marked as 500, 950, or 999 parts of palladium per thousand of the alloy.
Fountain pen nibs made from gold are sometimes plated with palladium when a silver (rather than gold) appearance is desired. Sheaffer has used palladium plating for decades, either as an accent on otherwise gold nibs or covering the gold completely.

Palladium is also used by the luxury brand Hermès as one of the metals plating the hardware on their handbags, most famous of which being Birkin.

===Photography===
In the platinotype printing process, photographers make fine-art black-and-white prints using platinum or palladium salts. Often used with platinum, palladium provides an alternative to silver.

==Effects on health==
===Toxicity===

Palladium is a metal with low toxicity as conventionally measured (e.g. LD50). Recent research on the mechanism of palladium toxicity suggests high toxicity if measured on a longer timeframe and at the cellular level in the liver and kidney. Mitochondria appear to have a key role in palladium toxicity via mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and depletion of the cellular glutathione (GSH) level. Until that recent work, it had been thought that palladium was poorly absorbed by the human body when ingested. Plants such as the water hyacinth are killed by low levels of palladium salts, but most other plants tolerate it, although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, growth is affected. High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic, though until the recent research cited above, no clear evidence indicated that the element harms humans.

===Precautions===
Like other platinum-group metals, bulk Pd is quite inert. Although contact dermatitis has been reported, data on the effects are limited. It has been shown that people with an allergic reaction to palladium also react to nickel, making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic.

Some palladium is emitted with the exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters. Between 4 and 108 ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food is estimated to be less than 2 μg per person a day. The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration, from which the uptake of palladium is estimated to be less than 15 μg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within three days.

The median lethal dose (LD50) of soluble palladium compounds in mice is 200 mg/kg for oral and 5 mg/kg for intravenous administration.

==History==
William Hyde Wollaston noted the discovery of a new noble metal in July 1802 in his lab book and named it palladium in August of the same year. He named the element after the asteroid 2 Pallas, which had been discovered two months earlier (and which was previously considered a planet). Wollaston purified a quantity of the material and offered it, without naming the discoverer, in a small shop in Soho in April 1803. After harsh criticism from Richard Chenevix, who claimed that palladium was an alloy of platinum and mercury, Wollaston anonymously offered a reward of £20 for 20 grains of synthetic palladium &quot;alloy&quot;. Chenevix received the Copley Medal in 1803 after he published his experiments on palladium. Wollaston published the discovery of rhodium in 1804 and mentions some of his work on palladium. He disclosed that he was the discoverer of palladium in a publication in 1805.

Wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from South America by dissolving the ore in aqua regia, neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide, and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride. He added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium(II) cyanide, which was heated to extract palladium metal.

Palladium chloride was at one time prescribed as a tuberculosis treatment at the rate of 0.065 g per day (approximately one milligram per kilogram of body weight). This treatment had many negative side-effects, and was later replaced by more effective drugs.

Most palladium is used for catalytic converters in the automobile industry. Catalytic converters are targets for thieves because they contain palladium and other rare metals. In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted; for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1 billion.

World demand for palladium increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300 tons in 2000. The global production of palladium from mines was 222 tonnes in 2006 according to the United States Geological Survey. Many were concerned about a steady supply of palladium in the wake of Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea, partly as sanctions could hamper Russian palladium exports; any restrictions on Russian palladium exports could have exacerbated what was already expected to be a large palladium deficit in 2014. Those concerns pushed palladium prices to their highest level since 2001. In September 2014 they soared above the $900 per ounce mark. In 2016 however palladium cost around $614 per ounce as Russia managed to maintain stable supplies. In January 2019 palladium futures climbed past $1,344 per ounce for the first time on record, mainly due to the strong demand from the automotive industry. Palladium reached on 6 January 2020, passing $2,000 per troy ounce the first time. The price rose above $3,000 per troy ounce in May 2021 and March 2022.

==Palladium as investment==
Global palladium sales were in 2017, of which 86% was used in the manufacturing of automotive catalytic converters, followed by industrial, jewelry, and investment usages. More than 75% of global platinum and 40% of palladium are mined in South Africa. Russia&#x27;s mining company, Norilsk Nickel, produces another 44% of palladium, with US and Canada-based mines producing most of the rest.

The price for palladium reached an all-time high of $2,981.40 per ounce on May 3, 2021, driven mainly on speculation of the catalytic converter demand from the automobile industry. Palladium is traded in the spot market with the code &quot;XPD&quot;. When settled in USD, the code is &quot;XPDUSD&quot;. A later surplus of the metal was caused by the Russian government selling stockpiles from the Soviet era, at a rate of about a year. The amount and status of this stockpile are a state secret.

During the Russo-Ukrainian War in March 2022, prices for palladium increased 13%, since the first of March. Russia is the primary supplier to Europe and the country supplies 37% of the global production.

===Palladium producers===
* Norilsk Nickel
* Sibanye-Stillwater
* Anglo American Platinum
* Impala Platinum
* Northam Platinum

=== Exchange-traded products ===
WisdomTree Physical Palladium () is backed by allocated palladium bullion and was the world&#x27;s first palladium ETF. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange as PHPD, Xetra Trading System, Euronext and Milan. ETFS Physical Palladium Shares () is an ETF traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

=== Bullion coins and bars ===

A traditional way of investing in palladium is buying bullion coins and bars made of palladium. Available palladium coins include the Canadian Palladium Maple Leaf, the Chinese Panda, and the American Palladium Eagle. The liquidity of direct palladium bullion investment is poorer than that of gold and silver because there is low circulation of palladium coins.

<doc id="23321" wikidata="Q1809" url="?curid=23321" title="Promethium">
<text>Promethium is a chemical element with symbol Pm and atomic number 61. All of its isotopes are radioactive; it is extremely rare, with only about 500–600 grams naturally occurring in the Earth&#x27;s crust at any given time. Promethium is one of the only two radioactive elements that are both preceded and followed in the periodic table by elements with stable forms, the other being technetium. Chemically, promethium is a lanthanide. Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of +3.

In 1902 Bohuslav Brauner suggested that there was a then-unknown element with properties intermediate between those of the known elements neodymium (60) and samarium (62); this was confirmed in 1914 by Henry Moseley, who, having measured the atomic numbers of all the elements then known, found that the element with atomic number 61 was missing. In 1926, two groups (one Italian and one American) claimed to have isolated a sample of element 61; both &quot;discoveries&quot; were soon proven to be false. In 1938, during a nuclear experiment conducted at Ohio State University, a few radioactive nuclides were produced that certainly were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium, but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced, and the discovery was not much recognized. Promethium was first produced and characterized at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1945 by the separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in a graphite reactor. The discoverers proposed the name &quot;prometheum&quot; (the spelling was subsequently changed), derived from Prometheus, the Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans, to symbolize &quot;both the daring and the possible misuse of mankind&#x27;s intellect&quot;. A sample of the metal was made only in 1963.

The two sources of natural promethium are rare alpha decays of natural europium-151 (producing promethium-147) and spontaneous fission of uranium (various isotopes). Promethium-145 is the most stable promethium isotope, but the only isotope with practical applications is promethium-147, chemical compounds of which are used in luminous paint, atomic batteries and thickness-measurement devices. Because natural promethium is exceedingly scarce, it is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium-235 (enriched uranium) with thermal neutrons to produce promethium-147 as a fission product.

==Properties==

===Physical properties===
A promethium atom has 61 electrons, arranged in the configuration Xe] 4f5 6s2. The seven 4f and 6s electrons are valence electrons. In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons and one 4f-electron, which belongs to an open subshell. The element&#x27;s atomic radius is the second largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the most notable exception to the general trend of the contraction of lanthanide atoms with the increase of their atomic numbers (lanthanide contraction). Many properties of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium. For example, the melting point, the first three ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and lower than those of samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm3+) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less than those of neodymium.

Promethium has a double hexagonal close packed (dhcp) structure and a hardness of 63 kg/mm2. This low-temperature alpha form converts into a beta, body-centered cubic (bcc) phase upon heating to 890 °C.

===Chemical properties and compounds===

Promethium belongs to the cerium group of lanthanides and is chemically very similar to the neighboring elements. Because of its instability, chemical studies of promethium are incomplete. Even though a few compounds have been synthesized, they are not fully studied; in general, they tend to be pink or red in color. In May 2024, a promethium coordination complex with neutral PyDGA ligands was characterized in aqueous solution. Treatment of acidic solutions containing ions with ammonia results in a gelatinous light-brown sediment of hydroxide, , which is insoluble in water. When dissolved in hydrochloric acid, a water-soluble yellow salt, , is produced; similarly, when dissolved in nitric acid, a nitrate results, . The latter is also well-soluble; when dried, it forms pink crystals, similar to . The electron configuration for is [Xe] 4f4, and the color of the ion is pink. The ground state term symbol is 5I4. The sulfate is slightly soluble, like the other cerium group sulfates. Cell parameters have been calculated for its octahydrate; they lead to conclusion that the density of is 2.86 g/cm3. The oxalate, , has the lowest solubility of all lanthanide oxalates.

Unlike the nitrate, the oxide is similar to the corresponding samarium salt and not the neodymium salt. As-synthesized, e.g. by heating the oxalate, it is a white or lavender-colored powder with disordered structure. This powder crystallizes in a cubic lattice upon heating to 600 °C. Further annealing at 800 °C and then at 1750 °C irreversibly transforms it to monoclinic and hexagonal phases, respectively, and the last two phases can be interconverted by adjusting the annealing time and temperature.

Promethium forms only one stable oxidation state, +3, in the form of ions; this is in line with other lanthanides. Promethium can also form the +2 oxidation state. Thermodynamic properties of Pm2+ suggests that the dihalides are stable, similar to NdCl2 and SmCl2.

===Isotopes===

Promethium is the only lanthanide and one of only two elements among the first 82 with no stable or long-lived (primordial) isotopes. This is a result of a rarely occurring effect of the liquid drop model and stabilities of neighbor element isotopes; it is also the least stable element of the first 84. The primary decay products are neodymium and samarium isotopes (promethium-146 decays to both, the lighter isotopes generally to neodymium via positron decay and electron capture, and the heavier isotopes to samarium via beta decay). Promethium nuclear isomers may decay to other promethium isotopes and one isotope (145Pm) has a very rare alpha decay mode to stable praseodymium-141.

The most stable isotope of the element is promethium-145, which has a specific activity of and a half-life of 17.7 years via electron capture. Because it has 84 neutrons (two more than 82, which is a magic number which corresponds to a stable neutron configuration), it may emit an alpha particle (which has 2 neutrons) to form praseodymium-141 with 82 neutrons. Thus it is the only promethium isotope with an experimentally observed alpha decay. Its partial half-life for alpha decay is about 6.3 years, and the relative probability for a 145Pm nucleus to decay in this way is 2.8 %. Several other promethium isotopes such as 144Pm, 146Pm, and 147Pm also have a positive energy release for alpha decay; their alpha decays are predicted to occur but have not been observed. In total, 41 isotopes of promethium are known, ranging from 126Pm to 166Pm.

The element also has 18 nuclear isomers, with mass numbers of 133 to 142, 144, 148, 149, 152, and 154 (some mass numbers have more than one isomer). The most stable of them is promethium-148m, with a half-life of 43.1 days; this is longer than the half-lives of the ground states of all promethium isotopes, except for promethium-143 to 147. In fact, promethium-148m has a longer half-life than its ground state, promethium-148.

==Occurrence==

In 1934, Willard Libby reported that he had found weak beta activity in pure neodymium, which was attributed to a half-life over 1012 years. Almost 20 years later, it was claimed that the element occurs in natural neodymium in equilibrium in quantities below 10−20 grams of promethium per one gram of neodymium. However, these observations were disproved by newer investigations, because for all seven naturally occurring neodymium isotopes, any single beta decays (which can produce promethium isotopes) are forbidden by energy conservation. In particular, careful measurements of atomic masses show that the mass difference between 150Nd and 150Pm is negative (−87 keV), which absolutely prevents the single beta decay of 150Nd to 150Pm.

In 1965, Olavi Erämetsä separated out traces of 147Pm from a rare earth concentrate purified from apatite, resulting in an upper limit of 10−21 for the abundance of promethium in nature; this may have been produced by the natural nuclear fission of uranium, or by cosmic ray spallation of 146Nd.

Both isotopes of natural europium have larger mass excesses than sums of those of their potential alpha daughters plus that of an alpha particle; therefore, they (stable in practice) may alpha decay to promethium. Research at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso showed that europium-151 decays to promethium-147 with the half-life of 5 years; later measurements gave the half-life as (4.62 ± 0.95(stat.) ± 0.68(syst.)) × 1018 years. It has been shown that europium is &quot;responsible&quot; for about 12 grams of promethium in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Alpha decays for europium-153 have not been found yet, and its theoretically calculated half-life is so high (due to low energy of decay) that this process will probably not be observed in the near future.

Promethium can also be formed in nature as a product of spontaneous fission of uranium-238. Only trace amounts can be found in naturally occurring ores: a sample of pitchblende has been found to contain promethium at a concentration of four parts per quintillion (4) by mass. Uranium is thus &quot;responsible&quot; for 560 g of promethium in Earth&#x27;s crust.

Promethium has also been identified in the spectrum of the star HR 465 in Andromeda; it also has been found in HD 101065 (Przybylski&#x27;s star) and HD 965. Because of the short half-life of promethium isotopes, they should be formed near the surface of those stars.

==History==

===Searches for element 61===
In 1902, Czech chemist Bohuslav Brauner found out that the differences in properties between neodymium and samarium were the largest between any two consecutive lanthanides in the sequence then known; as a conclusion, he suggested there was an element with intermediate properties between them. This prediction was supported in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having discovered that atomic number was an experimentally measurable property of elements, found that a few atomic numbers had no known corresponding elements: the gaps were 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87. With the knowledge of a gap in the periodic table several groups started to search for the predicted element among other rare earths in the natural environment.

The first claim of a discovery was published by Luigi Rolla and Lorenzo Fernandes of Florence, Italy. After separating a mixture of a few rare earth elements nitrate concentrate from the Brazilian mineral monazite by fractionated crystallization, they yielded a solution containing mostly samarium. This solution gave x-ray spectra attributed to samarium and element 61. In honor of their city, they named element 61 &quot;florentium&quot;. The results were published in 1926, but the scientists claimed that the experiments were done in 1924. Also in 1926, a group of scientists from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Smith Hopkins and Len Yntema published the discovery of element 61. They named it &quot;illinium&quot;, after the university. Both of these reported discoveries were shown to be erroneous because the spectrum line that &quot;corresponded&quot; to element 61 was identical to that of didymium; the lines thought to belong to element 61 turned out to belong to a few impurities (barium, chromium, and platinum).

In 1934, Josef Mattauch finally formulated the isobar rule. One of the indirect consequences of this rule was that element 61 was unable to form stable isotopes. From 1938, a nuclear experiment was conducted by H. B. Law et al. at the Ohio State University. Nuclides were produced in 1941 which were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium, and the name &quot;cyclonium&quot; was proposed, but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced and the discovery was not largely recognized.

===Discovery and synthesis of promethium metal===
Promethium was first produced and characterized at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Clinton Laboratories at that time) in 1945 by Jacob A. Marinsky, Lawrence E. Glendenin and Charles D. Coryell by separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in the graphite reactor; however, being too busy with military-related research during World War II, they did not announce their discovery until 1947. The original proposed name was &quot;clintonium&quot;, after the laboratory where the work was conducted; however, the name &quot;prometheum&quot; was suggested by Grace Mary Coryell, the wife of one of the discoverers. It is derived from Prometheus, the Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans and symbolizes &quot;both the daring and the possible misuse of the mankind intellect&quot;. The spelling was then changed to &quot;promethium&quot;, as this was in accordance with most other metals.

In 1963, promethium(III) fluoride was used to make promethium metal. Provisionally purified from impurities of samarium, neodymium, and americium, it was put into a tantalum crucible which was located in another tantalum crucible; the outer crucible contained lithium metal (10 times excess compared to promethium). After creating a vacuum, the chemicals were mixed to produce promethium metal:

:PmF3 + 3 Li → Pm + 3 LiF

The promethium sample produced was used to measure a few of the metal&#x27;s properties, such as its melting point.

In 1963, ion-exchange methods were used at ORNL to prepare about ten grams of promethium from nuclear reactor fuel processing wastes.

Promethium can be either recovered from the byproducts of uranium fission or produced by bombarding 146Nd with neutrons, turning it into 147Nd, which decays into 147Pm through beta decay with a half-life of 11 days.

==Production==

The production methods for different isotopes vary, and only those for promethium-147 are given because it is the only isotope with industrial applications. Promethium-147 is produced in large quantities (compared to other isotopes) by bombarding uranium-235 with thermal neutrons. The output is relatively high, at 2.6% of the total product. Another way to produce promethium-147 is via neodymium-147, which decays to promethium-147 with a short half-life. Neodymium-147 can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium-146 with thermal neutrons or by bombarding a uranium carbide target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator. Another method is to bombard uranium-238 with fast neutrons to cause fast fission, which, among multiple reaction products, creates promethium-147.

As early as the 1960s, Oak Ridge National Laboratory could produce 650 grams of promethium per year and was the world&#x27;s only large-volume synthesis facility. Gram-scale production of promethium was discontinued in the U.S. in the early 1980s, but will possibly be resumed after 2010 at the High Flux Isotope Reactor. In 2010, Russia was the only country producing promethium-147 on a relatively large scale.

==Applications==

Only promethium-147 has uses outside laboratories. It is obtained as the oxide or chloride, in milligram quantities. This isotope has a relatively long half-life, does not emit gamma rays, and its radiation has a relatively small penetration depth in matter.

Some signal lights use a luminous paint containing a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope does not cause aging of the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 was used for the purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). Promethium may be favored over tritium for nuclear safety.

In atomic batteries, the beta particles emitted by promethium-147 are converted into electric current by sandwiching a small promethium source between two semiconductor plates. These batteries have a useful lifetime of about five years. The first promethium-based battery was assembled in 1964 and generated &quot;a few milliwatts of power from a volume of about 2 cubic inches, including shielding&quot;.

Promethium is also used to measure the thickness of materials by measuring the amount of radiation from a promethium source that passes through the sample. It has possible future uses in portable X-ray sources, and as auxiliary heat or power sources for space probes and satellites (although the alpha emitter plutonium-238 has become standard for most space-exploration-related uses).

Promethium-147 is also used, albeit in very small quantities (less than 330nCi), in some Philips CFL (Compact Fluorescent Lamp) glow switches in the PLC 22W/28W 15mm CFL range.

==Precautions==
The element has no biological role. Promethium-147 can emit gamma rays, which are dangerous for all lifeforms, during its beta decay. Interactions with tiny quantities of promethium-147 are not hazardous if certain precautions are observed. In general, gloves, footwear covers, safety glasses, and an outer layer of easily removed protective clothing should be used.

It is not known what human organs are affected by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous to the environment and humans. If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.
