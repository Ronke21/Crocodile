<text>Nevis ( ) is an island in the Caribbean Sea that forms part of the inner arc of the Leeward Islands chain of the West Indies. Nevis and the neighbouring island of Saint Kitts constitute the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, a singular nation state. Nevis is located near the northern end of the Lesser Antilles archipelago about east-southeast of Puerto Rico and west of Antigua. Its area is and the capital is Charlestown.

Saint Kitts and Nevis are separated by The Narrows, a shallow channel. Nevis is roughly conical in shape with a volcano, Nevis Peak, at its centre. The island is fringed on its western and northern coastlines by sandy beaches composed of a mixture of white coral sand with brown and black sand eroded and washed down from the volcanic rocks that make up the island. The gently-sloping coastal plain ( wide) has natural freshwater springs as well as non-potable volcanic hot springs, especially along the western coast.

The island was named &quot;Oualie&quot;, translated as &quot;land of beautiful waters&quot;, by the Kalinago and &quot;Dulcina&quot; (&quot;Sweet Island&quot;) by the early British settlers. The name &quot;Nevis&quot; is derived from the Spanish phrase , which translates as Our Lady of the Snows; the name was given by the island&#x27;s Spanish discoverers and first appeared on maps in the 16th century. Nevis is also known by the sobriquet &quot;Queen of the Caribees&quot;, which it earned in the 18th century because of its many sugar plantations.

Nevis is both geographically smaller and less populous than Saint Kitts. It maintains significant autonomy within the federation, including a separate government headed by the premier of Nevis and a separate legislature. Nevis has twice voted – in 1977, in an unofficial referendum, and in 1998, in an official one – to secede from the federation, but neither attempt succeeded.

The majority of the approximately 12,000 Nevisians are of primarily African descent, with notable British, Portuguese, and Lebanese minority communities. English is the official language, and its literacy rate of 98 per cent is one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere.

==Etymology==

In 1498, Christopher Columbus gave the island the name &quot;San Martín&quot; (Saint Martin). However, the confusion of numerous poorly-charted small islands in the Leeward Island chain meant that this name ended up being accidentally transferred to another island, which is still known as Saint-Martin.

The current name &quot;Nevis&quot; was derived from the Spanish name by process of abbreviation and anglicisation. The Spanish name means Our Lady of the Snows. It is not known who chose this name for the island, but it is a reference to the story of a 4th-century Catholic miracle related to a snowfall on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. Presumably the white clouds that usually cover the top of Nevis Peak reminded someone of this story of a miraculous snowfall in a hot climate.

Nevis was part of the Spanish claim to the Caribbean islands, a claim pursued until the 1670 Treaty of Madrid, even though there were no Spanish settlements on the island. According to Vincent Hubbard, author of &quot;Swords, Ships &amp; Sugar: History of Nevis&quot;, the Spanish ruling caused many of the Arawak groups who were not ethnically Caribs to &quot;be redefined as Kalinago overnight&quot;. Records indicate that the Spanish enslaved large numbers of the native inhabitants on the more accessible of the Leeward Islands and sent them to Cubagua, Venezuela, to dive for pearls. Hubbard suggests that the reason the first European settlers found so few Kalinago on Nevis is that they had already been rounded up by the Spanish and shipped off to be used as slaves.

== History ==
===Amerindians===

Nevis had been settled for more than two thousand years by Amerindian peoples prior to having been sighted by Columbus in 1493. The indigenous people of Nevis during these periods belonged to the Leeward Island Amerindian groups popularly referred to as Arawaks and Kalinago, a complex mosaic of ethnic groups with similar culture and language. Dominican anthropologist Lennox Honychurch traces the European use of the term &quot;Carib&quot; to refer to the Leeward Island aborigines to Columbus, who picked it up from the Taínos on Hispaniola. It was not a name the Kalinago called themselves. &quot;Carib Indians&quot; was the generic name used for all groups believed involved in cannibalistic war rituals, more particularly, the consumption of parts of a killed enemy&#x27;s body.

The Amerindian name for Nevis was &quot;Oualie&quot;, land of beautiful waters. The structure of the Kalinago language has been linguistically identified as Arawakan.

===Colonial era===
Despite the Spanish claim, Nevis continued to be a popular stop over point for English and Dutch ships on their way to North America. Captain Bartholomew Gilbert of Plymouth visited the island in 1603, spending two weeks to cut 20 tons of lignum vitae wood. Gilbert sailed on to Virginia to seek out survivors of the Roanoke settlement in what is now North Carolina. Captain John Smith visited Nevis on his way to Virginia in 1607 on the voyage that founded Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in the New World.

On 30 August 1620, James I of England asserted sovereignty over Nevis by giving a Royal Patent for colonisation to the Earl of Carlisle. However, actual English settlement did not happen until 1628, when Anthony Hilton moved from nearby Saint Kitts following a murder plot against him. 80 English settlers accompanied him, soon boosted by a further 100 settlers from London who had initially hoped to settle Barbuda. Hilton became the first Governor of Nevis.

After the Treaty of Madrid between Spain and England, Nevis became a major part of the English West Indies and an admiralty court also sat in Nevis. Between 1675 and 1730, the island was the headquarters for the slave trade to the Leeward Islands, with approximately 6,000–7,000 enslaved West Africans passing through en route to other islands each year. The Royal African Company brought all its ships through Nevis. A 1678 census shows a community of Irish people – 22% of the population – existing as either indentured servants or freemen.

Due to the profitable slave trade and the high quality of Nevisian sugar cane, Nevis soon became a dominant source of wealth for the colonial slavocracy. When the Leeward Islands were separated from Barbados in 1671, Nevis became the seat of the Leeward Islands colony and was given the nickname &quot;Queen of the Caribees&quot;. It remained the colonial capital for the Leeward Islands until the seat was transferred to Antigua for military reasons in 1698. During this period, Nevis was the richest of the English Leeward Islands.

Nevis outranked larger islands like Jamaica in sugar production in the late 17th century. The planters&#x27; wealth on the island is evident in the tax records preserved at the Calendar State Papers in the Colonial Office&#x27;s Public Records, where the amount of tax collected on the Leeward Islands was recorded. The sums recorded for 1676 as &quot;head tax on slaves&quot;, a tax payable in sugar, amounted to 384,600 pounds in Nevis, as opposed to 67,000 each in Antigua and Saint Kitts, 62,500 in Montserrat, and 5,500 total in the other five islands.

The profits on sugar cultivation in Nevis was enhanced by the fact that the cane juice from Nevis yielded an unusually high amount of sugar. A gallon (3.79 litres) of cane juice from Nevis yielded 24 ounces (0.71 litres) of sugar, whereas a gallon from Saint Kitts yielded 16 ounces (0.47 litres). Twenty per cent of the English colonial empire&#x27;s total sugar production in 1700 was derived from Nevisian plantations. Exports from West Indian colonies like Nevis were worth more than all the exports from all the mainland Thirteen Colonies of North America combined at the time of the American Revolutionary War.

The enslaved families formed the large labour force required to work the sugar plantations. After the 1650s, the supply of white indentured servants began to dry up due to increased wages in England and less incentive to migrate to the colonies. By the end of the 17th century, the population of Nevis consisted of a small, wealthy planter elite in control, a marginal population of poor Whites, a great majority of African-descended slaves, and an unknown number of maroons, escaped slaves living in the mountains. In 1780, 90 per cent of the 10,000 people living on Nevis were Black. Some of the maroons joined with the few remaining Kalinago in Nevis. Memories of the Nevisian maroons&#x27; struggle under the plantation system are preserved in place names such as Maroon Hill, an early centre of resistance.

The great wealth generated by the colonies of the West Indies led to wars among the great powers of Europe. The formation of the United States can be said to be a partial by-product of these wars, and the strategic trade aims that often ignored North America. Three privateers (William Kidd being one of them) were employed by the Crown to help protect ships in Nevis&#x27; waters.

During the 17th century, the French, based on Saint Kitts, launched many attacks on Nevis, sometimes assisted by the Kalinago, who in 1667 sent a large fleet of canoes along in support. In the same year, a Franco-Dutch invasion fleet was repelled off Nevis by an English fleet. Letters and other records from the era indicate that colonists on Nevis hated and feared the Kalinago. In 1674 and 1683, they participated in attacks on Kalinago villages in Dominica and St. Vincent, despite a lack of official approval from the Crown for the attack. On Nevis, the English built Fort Charles and a series of smaller fortifications to aid in defending the island. This included Saddle Hill Battery, built in 1740 to replace a deodand on Mount Nevis.

===Emancipation===
In 1706, Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville, the French Canadian founder of Louisiana in North America, decided to drive the English out of Nevis and thus also stop pirate attacks on French ships; he considered Nevis the region&#x27;s headquarters for piracy against French trade. During d&#x27;Iberville&#x27;s invasion of Nevis, French buccaneers were used in the front line, infamous for being ruthless killers after the pillaging during the wars with Spain where they gained a reputation for torturing and murdering non-combatants. In the face of the invading force, the English militiamen of Nevis fled.

Some planters burned the plantations, rather than letting the French have them, and hid in the mountains. It was the enslaved Africans who held the French at bay by taking up arms to defend their families and the island. The slave quarters had been looted and burned as well, as the main reward promised the men fighting on the French side in the attack was the right to capture as many slaves as possible and resell them in Martinique.

During the fighting, 3,400 enslaved Nevisians were captured and sent off to Martinique, but about 1,000 more, poorly armed and militarily untrained, held the French troops at bay, by &quot;murderous fire&quot; according to an eyewitness account by an English militiaman. He wrote that &quot;the slaves&#x27; brave behaviour and defence there shamed what some of their masters did, and they do not shrink to tell us so.&quot; After 18 days of fighting, the French were driven off the island. Among the Nevisian men, women and children carried away on d&#x27;Iberville&#x27;s ships, six ended up in Louisiana, the first persons of African descent to arrive there.

One consequence of the French attack was a collapsed sugar industry and during the ensuing hardship on Nevis, small plots of land on the plantations were made available to the enslaved families in order to control the loss of life due to starvation. With less profitability for the absentee plantation owners, the import of food supplies for the plantation workers dwindled. Between 1776 and 1783, when the food supplies failed to arrive altogether due to the rebellion in North America, 300–400 enslaved Nevisians starved to death. On 1 August 1834, slavery was abolished in the British Empire. In Nevis, 8,815 slaves were freed. The first Monday in August is celebrated as Emancipation Day and is part of the annual Nevis Culturama festival.

A four-year apprenticeship programme followed the abolishment of slavery on the plantations. In spite of the continued use of the labour force, the Nevisian slave owners were paid over £150,000 in compensation from the British Government for the loss of property, whereas the enslaved families received nothing for 200 years of labour. One of the wealthiest planter families in Nevis, the Pinneys of Mountravers Plantation, claimed £36,396 () in compensation for the slaves on the family-owned plantations around the Caribbean.

Because of the early distribution of plots and because many of the planters departed from the island when sugar cultivation became unprofitable, a relatively large percentage of Nevisians already owned or controlled land at emancipation. Others settled on crown land. This early development of a society with a majority of small, landowning farmers and entrepreneurs created a stronger middle class in Nevis than in Saint Kitts, where the sugar industry continued until 2006. Even though the 15 families in the wealthy planter elite no longer control the arable land, Saint Kitts still has a large, landless working class population.

===1800 to the present day===
The population had reached 7,470 by 1842. Nevis was united with Saint Kitts and Anguilla in 1882, and they became an associated state with full internal autonomy in 1967, though Anguilla seceded in 1971. Together, Saint Kitts and Nevis became independent on 19 September 1983. On 10 August 1998, a referendum on Nevis to separate from Saint Kitts had 2,427 votes in favour and 1,498 against, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed.

Before 1967, the local government of Saint Kitts was also the government of Nevis and Anguilla. Nevis had two seats and Anguilla one seat in the government. The economic and infrastructural development of the two smaller islands was not a priority to the colonial federal government.

When the hospital in Charlestown was destroyed in a hurricane in 1899, planting of trees in the squares of Saint Kitts and refurbishing of government buildings, also in Saint Kitts, took precedence over the rebuilding of the only hospital in Nevis. After five years without any proper medical facilities, the leaders in Nevis initiated a campaign, threatening to seek independence from Saint Kitts. The British Administrator in Saint Kitts, Charles Cox, was unmoved. He stated that Nevis did not need a hospital since there had been no significant rise in the number of deaths during the time Nevisians had been without a hospital. Therefore, no action was needed on behalf of the government, and besides, Cox continued, the Legislative Council regarded &quot;Nevis and Anguilla as a drag on St. Kitts and would willingly see a separation&quot;.

A letter of complaint to the metropolitan British Foreign Office gave result and the federal government in Saint Kitts was ordered by their superiors in London to take speedy action. The Legislative Council took another five years to consider their options. The final decision by the federal government was to not rebuild the old hospital after all but to instead convert the old Government House in Nevis into a hospital, named Alexandra Hospital after Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII. A majority of the funds assigned for the hospital could thus be spent on the construction of a new official residence in Nevis.

After d&#x27;Iberville&#x27;s invasion in 1704, records show Nevis&#x27; sugar industry in ruins and a decimated population begging the English Parliament and relatives for loans and monetary assistance to stave off island-wide starvation. The sugar industry on the island never fully recovered and during the general depression that followed the loss of the West Indian sugar monopoly, Nevis fell on hard times and the island became one of the poorest in the region. The island remained poorer than Saint Kitts until 1991, when the fiscal performance of Nevis edged ahead of the fiscal performance of Saint Kitts for the first time since the French invasion.

Electricity was introduced in Nevis in 1954 when two generators were shipped in to provide electricity to the area around Charlestown. In this regard, Nevis fared better than Anguilla, where there were no paved roads, no electricity and no telephones until 1967. However, electricity did not become available island-wide on Nevis until 1971.

An ambitious infrastructure development programme was introduced in the early 2000s which included a transformation of the Charlestown port, construction of a new deep-water harbour, resurfacing and widening the Island Main Road, a new airport terminal and control tower, and a major airport expansion, which required the relocation of an entire village in order to make room for the runway extension.

Modernised classrooms and better-equipped schools, as well as improvements in the educational system, have contributed to a leap in academic performance on the island. The pass rate among the Nevisian students sitting for the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) exams, the Cambridge General Certificate of Education Examination (GCE) and the Caribbean Advance Proficiency Examinations is now consistently among the highest in the English-speaking Caribbean.

===Hurricanes===
* September 1989: there was a considerable amount of damage from Hurricane Hugo.
* September 1998, there was a great deal of damage from Hurricane Georges.
* November 1999: Nevis was hit by Hurricane Lenny, which caused some heavy damage to the island&#x27;s infrastructure on the western coast, because of the storm&#x27;s unusual track from west to east.
* October 2008: Nevis was brushed with the edge of Hurricane Omar. Among other establishments, The Four Seasons Resort Nevis was forced to close to undergo repairs. Hurricane Omar thus caused the loss of 600 jobs for over 2 years; the resort reopened on 15 December 2010.
* August 2010: there was some damage on Nevis from Hurricane Earl.
* September 2010, there was some damage from Hurricane Igor.
* September 2017, there was damage from Hurricane Irma.

== Geography ==

The formation of the island began in mid-Pliocene times, approximately 3.45 million years ago. Nine distinct eruptive centres from different geological ages, ranging from mid-Pliocene to Pleistocene, have contributed to the formation. No single model of the island&#x27;s geological evolution can, therefore, be ascertained.

Nevis Peak ( high) is the dormant remnant of one of these ancient stratovolcanoes. The last activity took place about 100,000 years ago, but active fumaroles and hot springs are still found on the island, the most recent formed in 1953. The composite cone of Nevis volcano has two overlapping summit craters that are partially filled by a lava dome, created in recent, pre-Columbian time. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows were deposited on the lower slopes of the cone simultaneously.

Nevis Peak is located on the outer crater rim. Four other lava domes were constructed on the flanks of the volcano, one on the northeast flank (Madden&#x27;s Mount), one on the eastern flank (Butlers Mountain), one on the northwest coast (Mount Lily) and one on the south coast (Saddle Hill, with a height of ). The southernmost point on the island is Dogwood Point which is also the southernmost point of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.

During the last ice age, when the sea level was 60 metres (200&#x27;) lower, the three islands of Saint Kitts, Nevis and Sint Eustatius (also known as Statia) were connected as one island. Saba, however, is separated from these three by a deeper channel.

There are visible wave-breaking reefs along the northern and eastern shorelines. To the south and west, the reefs are located in deeper water. The most developed beach on Nevis is the or Pinney&#x27;s Beach, on the western or Caribbean coast. There is sheltered swimming at Pinney, Nisbet, Lovers, and Oualie beaches. The eastern coast of the island faces into the Atlantic Ocean.

The colour of the sand on the beaches of Nevis is variable: on a lot of the bigger beaches the sand is a yellow-grey in colour, but some beaches on the southern coast have darker, reddish, or even black sand. Under a microscope it becomes clear that Nevis sand is a mixture of tiny fragments of coral, many foraminifera, and small crystals of the various mineral constituents of the volcanic rock of which the island is made.

===Geology===
Seven volcanic centers make up Nevis. These include Round Hill (3.43 Ma), Cades Bay (3.22 Ma), Hurricane Hill (2.7 Ma), Saddle Hill (1.8 Ma), Butlers Mountain (1.1 Ma), Red Cliff and Nevis Peak (0.98 Ma). These are mainly andesite and dacite lava domes, with associated block and ash flows, plus lahars. Nevis Peak has the highest elevation, at 984 m. Cades Bay and Farm Estate Soufriere are noted areas of hydrothermal activity.

Water has been piped since 1911 from a spring called the &quot;Source&quot;, located up the mountain, to storage tanks at Rawlins Village, and since 1912, to Butler&#x27;s Village. Additional drinking water comes from Nelson&#x27;s Spring near Cotton Ground and Bath Spring. Groundwater has been extracted since the 1990s, and mixed with the Source water.

===Colonial deforestation===

During the 17th and 18th centuries, massive deforestation was undertaken by the planters as the land was initially cleared for sugar cultivation. This intense land exploitation by the sugar and cotton industry lasted almost 300 years, and greatly changed the island&#x27;s ecosystem.

In some places along the windswept southeast or &quot;Windward&quot; coast of the island, the landscape is radically altered compared with how it used to be in pre-colonial times. Due to extreme land erosion, the topsoil was swept away, and in some places at the coast, sheer cliffs as high as have developed.

Thick forest once covered the eastern coastal plain, where the Amerindians built their first settlements during the Aceramic period, complementing the ecosystem surrounding the coral reef just offshore. It was the easy access to fresh water on the island and the rich food source represented by the ocean life sheltered by the reef that made it feasible for the Amerindians to settle this area around 600 BC. With the loss of the natural vegetation, the balance in runoff nutrients to the reef was disturbed, eventually causing as much as 80 per cent of the large eastern fringing reef to become inactive. As the reef broke apart, it, in turn, provided less protection for the coastline.

During times of maximum cultivation, sugar cane fields stretched from the coastline of Nevis up to an altitude at which the mountain slopes were too steep and rocky to farm. Nonetheless, once the sugar industry was finally abandoned, vegetation on the leeward side of the island regrew reasonably well, as scrub and secondary forest.

===Water resources===

Nevis has several natural freshwater springs, including Nelson&#x27;s Spring. The island also has numerous non-potable volcanic hot springs, including most notably the Bath Spring near Bath village, just south of the capital Charlestown.

After heavy rains, powerful rivers of rainwater pour down the numerous ravines, known as ghauts. When the water reaches the coastline, the corresponding coastal ponds, both freshwater and brackish, fill to capacity and beyond, spilling over into the sea.

With modern development, the existing freshwater springs are no longer enough to supply water to the whole island. The water supply now comes mostly from Government wells. The major source of potable water for the island is groundwater, obtained from 14 active wells. Water is pumped from the wells, stored and allowed to flow by gravity to the various locations.

===Climate===

The climate is tropical with little variation, tempered all year round (but particularly from December through February) by the steady north-easterly winds, called the trade winds. There is a slightly hotter and somewhat rainier season from May to November.

Nevis lies within the track area of tropical storms and occasional hurricanes. These storms can develop between June 1 and November 30. This time of year has the heaviest rainfalls.

Nevis also experiences many fires, including the devastating Nevisian Fire of 1876.

== Economy ==
The official currency is the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$), which is shared used by the eight member countries of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank.

The European Commission&#x27;s Delegation in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean estimates the annual per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on Nevis to be about 10 per cent higher than on St. Kitts.

===Tourism===
The major source of revenue for Nevis as of 2023 according to IMF is tourism. During the 2003–2004 season, approximately 40,000 tourists visited the island. A five-star hotel &quot;(The Four Seasons Resort Nevis, West Indies)&quot;, four exclusive restored plantation inns, and several smaller hotels including Oualie Beach Resort are currently in operation. Larger developments along the west coast have recently been approved and are in the process of being developed.

===Offshore banking===
The introduction of secrecy legislation has made offshore financial services a rapidly growing economic sector in Nevis. Incorporation of companies, international insurance and reinsurance, as well as several international banks, trust companies, asset management firms, have created a boost in the economy. During 2005, the Nevis Island Treasury collected $94.6 million in annual revenue, compared to $59.8 million during 2001.

In 1998, 17,500 international banking companies were registered in Nevis. Registration and annual filing fees paid in 1999 by these entities amounted to over 10 per cent of Nevis&#x27; revenues. The offshore financial industry gained importance during the financial disaster of 1999 when Hurricane Lenny damaged the major resort on the island, causing the hotel to be closed down for a year and 400 of the 700 employees to be laid off.

In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a blacklist of 35 nations which were said to be non-cooperative in the campaign against tax evasion and money laundering. At the time, the list included the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, although the country was subsequently removed following various reforms.

== Politics ==

The political structure for the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis is based on the Westminster Parliamentary system, but it is a unique structure in that Nevis has its own unicameral legislature, consisting of His Majesty&#x27;s representative (the Deputy Governor General) and members of the Nevis Island Assembly. Nevis has considerable autonomy in its legislative branch. The constitution actually empowers the Nevis Island Legislature to make laws that cannot be abrogated by the National Assembly.

Nevis has a constitutionally protected right to secede from the federation, should a two-thirds majority of the island&#x27;s population vote for independence in a local referendum. Section 113.(1) of the constitution states: &quot;The Nevis Island Legislature may provide that the island of Nevis shall cease to be federated with the island of Saint Christopher and accordingly that this Constitution shall no longer have effect in the island of Nevis.&quot;

Nevis has its own premier and its own government, the Nevis Island Administration. It collects its own taxes and has a separate budget, with a current account surplus. According to a statement released by the Nevis Ministry of Finance in 2005, Nevis had one of the highest growth rates in gross national product and per capita income in the Caribbean at that point.

===Elections===

Nevis elections are scheduled every five years. The Nevis elections of 2013, called on 23 January 2013, were won by the party in opposition, the Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM), led by Vance Amory. The CCM won three of the five seats in the Nevis Island Assembly, while the incumbent party, the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP), won two.

In the federal elections of 2010, the CCM won two of the three Nevis assigned Federal seats, while the NRP won one. Of the eight Saint Kitts assigned federal seats, the St Kitts-Nevis Labour Party won six and the People&#x27;s Action Movement (PAM) two.

===Movement for constitutional reform===
Joseph Parry, leader of the opposition, has indicated that he favours constitutional reform over secession for Nevis. His party, the NRP, has historically been the strongest and most ardent proponent for Nevis independence; the party came to power with secession as the main campaign issue. In 1975, the NRP manifesto declared that: &quot;The Nevis Reformation Party will strive at all costs to gain secession for Nevis from St. Kitts – a privilege enjoyed by the island of Nevis prior to 1882.&quot;

A cursory proposal for constitutional reform was presented by the NRP in 1999, but the issue was not prominent in the 2006 election campaign and it appears a detailed proposal has yet to be worked out and agreed upon within the party.

In &quot;Handbook of Federal Countries&quot; published by Forum of Federations, the authors consider the constitution problematic because it does not &quot;specifically outline&quot; the federal financial arrangements or the means by which the central government and Nevis Island Administration can raise revenue: &quot;In terms of the NIA, the constitution only states (in s. 108(1)) that &#x27;all revenues...raised or received by the Administration...shall be paid into and form a fund styled the Nevis Island Consolidated Fund.&#x27; [...] Section 110(1) states that the proceeds of all &#x27;takes&#x27; collected in St. Kitts and Nevis under any law are to be shared between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration based on population. The share going to the NIA, however, is subject to deductions (s. 110(2)), such as the cost of common services and debt charges, as determined by the Governor-General (s.110(3)) on the advice of the Prime Minister who can also take advice from the Premier of Nevis (s.110(4)).&quot;

According to a 1995 report by the Commonwealth Observer Group of the Commonwealth Secretariat, &quot;the federal government is also the local government of St Kitts and this has resulted in a perception among the political parties in Nevis that the interests of the people of Nevis are being neglected by the federal government which is more concerned with the administration of St Kitts than with the federal administration.&quot;

===Secession movement===
Simeon Daniel, Nevis&#x27; first Premier and former leader of the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP) and Vance Amory, Premier and leader of the Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM), made sovereign independence for Nevis from the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis part of their parties&#x27; agenda. Since independence from the United Kingdom in 1983, the Nevis Island Administration and the Federal Government have been involved in several conflicts over the interpretation of the new constitution which came into effect at independence. During an interview on Voice of America in March 1998, repeated in a government-issued press release headlined &quot;PM Douglas Maintains 1983 Constitution is Flawed&quot;, Prime Minister Denzil Douglas called the constitution a &quot;recipe for disaster and disharmony among the people of both islands&quot;.

A crisis developed in 1984 when the People&#x27;s Action Movement (PAM) won a majority in the Federal elections and temporarily ceased honouring the Federal Government&#x27;s financial obligations to Nevis. Consequently, cheques issued by the Nevis Administration were not honoured by the Bank, public servants in Nevis were not paid on time and the Nevis Island Administration experienced difficulties in meeting its financial obligations.

There is also substantial support in Nevis for British Overseas Territory status similar to Anguilla&#x27;s, which was formerly the third of the tri-state Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla colony.

====Legislative motivation for secession====
In 1996, four new bills were introduced in the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, one of which made provisions to have revenue derived from activities in Nevis paid directly to the treasury in Saint Kitts instead of to the treasury in Nevis. Another bill, The Financial Services Committee Act, contained provisions that all investments in Saint Kitts and Nevis would require approval by an investment committee in Saint Kitts. This was controversial, because ever since 1983 the Nevis Island Administration had approved all investments for Nevis, on the basis that the constitution vests legislative authority for industries, trades and businesses and economic development in Nevis to the Nevis Island Administration.

All three representatives from Nevis, including the leader of the opposition in the Nevis Island Assembly, objected to the introduction of these bills into the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, arguing that the bills would affect the ability of Nevis to develop its offshore financial services sector and that the bills would be detrimental to the Nevis economy. All the representatives in opposition in the National Assembly shared the conviction that the bills if passed into law, would be unconstitutional and undermine the constitutional and legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration, as well as result in the destruction of the economy of Nevis.

The constitutional crisis initially developed when the newly appointed Attorney General refused to grant permission for the Nevis Island Administration to assert its legal right in the Courts. After a decision of the High Court in favour of the Nevis Island Administration, the Prime Minister gave newspaper interviews stating that he &quot;refused to accept the decision of the High Court&quot;. Due to the deteriorating relationship between the Nevis Island Administration and the Federal Government, a Constitutional Committee was appointed in April 1996 to advise on whether or not the present constitutional arrangement between the islands should continue. The committee recommended constitutional reform and the establishment of an island administration for Saint Kitts, separate from the Federal Government.

The Federal Government in Saint Kitts fills both functions today and Saint Kitts does not have an equivalent to the Nevis Island Administration. Disagreements between the political parties in Nevis and between the Nevis Island Administration and the Federal Government have prevented the recommendations by the electoral committee from being implemented. The problematic political arrangement between the two islands, therefore, continues to date.

Nevis has continued developing its own legislation, such as The Nevis International Insurance Ordinance and the Nevis International Mutual Funds Ordinance of 2004, but calls for secession are often based on concerns that the legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration might be challenged again in the future.

====Fiscal motivation for secession====
The issues of political dissension between Saint Kitts and Nevis are often centred around perceptions of imbalance in the economic structure. As noted by many scholars, Nevisians have often referred to a structural imbalance in Saint Kitts&#x27; favour in how funds are distributed between the two islands and this issue has made the movement for Nevis secession a constant presence in the island&#x27;s political arena, with many articles appearing in the local press expressing concerns such as those compiled by Everton Powell in &quot;What Motivates Our Call for Independence&quot;: 
* Many of the businesses that operate in Nevis are headquartered in Saint Kitts and pay the corporate taxes to Saint Kitts, despite the fact that profits for those businesses are derived from Nevis.
* The vast majority of Nevisians and residents of Nevis depart the Federation from Saint Kitts. This meant that departure taxes are paid in Saint Kitts.
* The bulk of cargo destined for Nevis enters the Federation through Saint Kitts. Custom duties are therefore paid in Saint Kitts.
* The largest expenditure for Nevis, approximately 29 per cent of the Nevis Island Administration&#x27;s recurrent budget, is education and health services, but the Nevis Island Legislature has no power to legislate over these two areas.
* Police, defense and coast guard are a federal responsibility. Charlestown Police Station, which served as the Headquarters for police officers in Nevis, was destroyed by fire in December 1991. Police officers initially had to operate out of the ruin, until the Nevis Island Administration managed to raise the resources to re-house the police.
* Nevis experiences an economic disadvantage because of preferential treatment by the federal government for development of Saint Kitts. The division of foreign aid and various forms of international assistance toward development and infrastructure are especially contentious issues. Lists showing the disparities in sharing have been compiled by Dr. Everson Hull, a former Economics professor of Howard University, and are available online.

====1998 referendum====

A referendum on secession from the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis was held in 1998. Although 62% voted in favor of a secession, a two-thirds majority would have been necessary for the referendum to succeed.

== Administrative divisions ==
The island of Nevis is divided into five administrative subdivisions called parishes, each of which has an elected representative in the Nevis Island Assembly. The division of this almost round island into parishes was done in a circular sector pattern, so each parish is shaped like a pie slice, reaching from the highest point of Nevis Peak down to the coastline.

Some of the parishes have double names. For example, Saint George Gingerland&#x27;s first part of its name is the name of the patron saint of the parish church, and the second part of the name is the traditional common name of the parish. Often the parishes are referred to simply by their common names. The religious part of a parish name is sometimes written or pronounced in the possessive, as follows: Saint George&#x27;s Gingerland.

The five parishes of Nevis are:
* Saint George Gingerland
* Saint James Windward
* Saint John Figtree
* Saint Paul Charlestown
* Saint Thomas Lowland

== Culture ==

&quot;Culturama&quot;, the annual cultural festival of Nevis, is celebrated during the Emancipation Day weekend, the first week of August. The festivities include many traditional folk dances, such as the masquerade, the Moko jumbies on stilts, Cowboys and Indians, and Plait the Ribbon, a May pole dance. The celebration was given a more organised form in 1974, including a Miss Culture Show and a Calypso Competition, as well as drama performances, old fashion Troupes (including Johnny Walkers, Giant and Spear, Bulls, Red Cross and Blue Ribbon), arts and crafts exhibitions and recipe competitions. According to the Nevis Department of Culture, the aim is to protect and encourage indigenous folklore, in order to make sure that the uniquely Caribbean culture can &quot;reassert itself and flourish&quot;.

===Language===
The official language is English. Saint Kitts Creole is also spoken on Nevis and less so on the neighbouring island.

===Music, theatre and dance===
Nevisian culture has since the 17th century incorporated African, European, and East Indian cultural elements, creating a distinct Afro-Caribbean culture. Several historical anthropologists have done field research Nevis and in Nevisian migrant communities in order to trace the creation and constitution of a Nevisian cultural community. Karen Fog Olwig published her research about Nevis in 1993, writing that the areas where the Afro-Caribbean traditions were especially strong and flourishing relate to kinship and subsistence farming. However, she adds, Afro-Caribbean cultural impulses were not recognised or valued in the colonial society and were therefore often expressed through Euro-Caribbean cultural forms.

Examples of European forms appropriated to express Afro-Caribbean culture are the Nevisian and Kittitian &quot;Tea Meetings&quot; and &quot;Christmas Sports&quot;. According to anthropologist Roger D. Abrahams, these traditional performance art forms are &quot;Nevisian approximation of British performance codes, techniques, and patterns&quot;. He writes that the Tea Meetings were staged as theatrical &quot;battles between decorum and chaos&quot;, decorum represented by the ceremony chairmen and chaos the hecklers in the audience, with a diplomatic King or a Queen presiding over the battle to ensure fairness.

The Christmas Sports included a form of comedy and satire based on local events and gossip. They were historically an important part of the Christmas celebrations in Nevis, performed on Christmas Eve by small troupes consisting of five or six men accompanied by string bands from different parts of the island. One of the men in the troupe was dressed as a woman, playing all the female parts in the dramatisations. The troupes moved from yard to yard to perform their skits, using props, face paint and costumes to play the roles of well-known personalities in the community.

Examples of gossip about undesired behaviour that could surface in the skits for comic effect were querulous neighbours, adulterous affairs, planters mistreating workers, domestic disputes or abuse, crooked politicians and any form of stealing or cheating experienced in the society. Even though no names were mentioned in these skits, the audience would usually be able to guess who the heckling message in the troupe&#x27;s dramatised portrayals was aimed at, as it was played out right on the person&#x27;s own front yard. The acts thus functioned as social and moral commentaries on current events and behaviours in Nevisian society. This particular form is called &quot;Bazzarding&quot; by many locals. Abrahams theorises that Christmas Sports are rooted in the pre-emancipation Christmas and New Year holiday celebrations, when the enslaved population had several days off.

American folklorist and musicologist Alan Lomax visited Nevis in 1962 in order to conduct long-term research into the black folk culture of the island. His field trip to Nevis and surrounding islands resulted in the anthology &quot;Lomax Caribbean Voyage&quot; series. 
Among the Nevisians recorded were chantey-singing fishermen in a session organised in a rum shop in Newcastle; Santoy, the Calypsonian, performing calypsos by Nevisian ballader and local legend Charles Walters to guitar and cuatro; and string bands, fife players and drummers from Gingerland, performing quadrilles.

The island is also known for &quot;Jamband music&quot;, which is the kind of music performed by local bands during the &quot;Culturama Festival&quot; and is key to &quot;Jouvert&quot; dancing. The sounds of the so-called &quot;Iron Band&quot; are also popular within the culture; many locals come together using any old pans, sinks, or other kits of any sort; which they use to create sounds and music. This form of music is played throughout the villages during the Christmas and carnival seasons.

===Architecture===

A series of earthquakes during the 18th century severely damaged most of the colonial-era stone buildings of Charlestown. The Georgian stone buildings in Charlestown that are visible today had to be partially rebuilt after the earthquakes, and this led to the development of a new architectural style, consisting of a wooden upper floor over a stone ground floor; the new style resisted earthquake damage much more effectively.

Two important Nevisian buildings from the 18th century are Hermitage Plantation, built of lignum vitae wood in 1740, the oldest surviving wooden house still in use in the Caribbean today, and the Bath Hotel, the first hotel in the Caribbean, a luxury hotel and spa built by John Huggins in 1778. The soothing waters of the hotel&#x27;s hot spring and the lively social life on Nevis attracted Europeans including Antigua-based Admiral Nelson, and Prince William Henry, Duke of Clarence, (future William IV of the United Kingdom), who attended balls and private parties at the Bath Hotel. Today, the building serves as government offices, and there are two outdoor hot-spring bathing spots which were specially constructed in recent years for public use.

According to local folklore, a destructive 1680 or 1690 earthquake and tsunami destroyed the buildings of the original capital Jamestown on the west coast. Folk tales say that the town sank beneath the ocean, and the tsunami is blamed for the escape of (possibly fictional) pirate Red Legs Greaves. However, archaeologists from the University of Southampton who have done excavations in the area have found no evidence for such a tsunami. They state that this story may originate with an over-excited Victorian letter writer sharing somewhat exaggerated accounts of his exotic life in the tropical colony with a British audience back home.

One such letter recounts that so much damage was done to the town that it was completely evacuated, and was engulfed by the sea. Early maps do not, however, actually show a settlement called &quot;Jamestown&quot;, only &quot;Morton&#x27;s Bay&quot;, and later maps show that all that was left of Jamestown/Morton&#x27;s Bay in 1818 was a building labelled &quot;Pleasure House&quot;. Very old bricks that wash up on Pinney&#x27;s Beach after storms may have contributed to this legend of a sunken town; however, these bricks are thought to be dumped ballast from 17th and 18th century sailing ships.

In 2004 and 2018, &quot;Time&quot; included her on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world, and in 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; named her one of the greatest actors of the 21st century.

==Early life==
Nicole Mary Kidman was born on 20 June 1967, in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were temporarily in the United States on student visas. Her mother, Janelle Ann (Glenny), a nursing instructor and member of the Women&#x27;s Electoral Lobby, edited her husband&#x27;s books; her father, Antony Kidman, was a biochemist, clinical psychologist, and author. She has a younger sister, Antonia, who is a journalist and television presenter. Having been born in the US to Australian parents, Kidman holds dual Australian and US citizenship. She has English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. Being born in Hawaii, she was given the Hawaiian name &quot;Hōkūlani&quot; (), meaning &quot;heavenly star&quot;. The inspiration came from a baby elephant born around the same time at the Honolulu Zoo.

When Kidman was born, her father was a graduate student at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. He became a visiting fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health. While living in Washington, D.C., following Kidman&#x27;s birth during the Vietnam War, her parents participated in anti-Vietnam War protests. Her family eventually returned to Australia three years later. She grew up in Longueville, Sydney where she attended Lane Cove Public School and North Sydney Girls High School. She was enrolled in ballet at the age of three and showed her natural talent for acting during her primary and high school years.

Kidman has said she first aspired to become an actress upon watching Margaret Hamilton&#x27;s performance as the Wicked Witch of the West in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. She revealed that she was timid as a child, saying, &quot;I am very shy – really shy – I even had a stutter as a kid, which I slowly got over, but I still regress into that shyness. So I don&#x27;t like walking into a crowded restaurant by myself; I don&#x27;t like going to a party by myself.&quot; During her teenage years, she attended the Phillip Street Theatre, alongside fellow actress Naomi Watts, and the Australian Theatre for Young People, where she took up drama and mime as she found acting to be a refuge. Owing to her fair skin and naturally red hair, the sun drove her to rehearse in the halls of the theatre. A regular at the Phillip Street Theatre, she was encouraged to pursue acting full-time, which she did by dropping out of high school.

==Career==
===Early work and breakthrough (1983–1994)===
In 1983, 16-year-old Kidman made her film debut in a remake of the Australian holiday classic &quot;Bush Christmas&quot;. By the end of that year, she had a supporting role in the television series &quot;Five Mile Creek&quot;. In 1984, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, which caused Kidman to halt her acting work temporarily while she studied massage therapy to help her mother with physical therapy. She began gaining recognition during this decade after appearing in several Australian films, such as the action comedy &quot;BMX Bandits&quot; (1983) and the romantic comedy &quot;Windrider&quot; (1986). Throughout the rest of the 1980s, she appeared in various Australian television programs, including the 1987 miniseries &quot;Vietnam&quot;, for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award.

Kidman next appeared in the Australian film &quot;Emerald City&quot; (1988), based on the play of the same name, which earned her a second Australian Film Institute Award. She then starred alongside Sam Neill in the 1989 thriller &quot;Dead Calm&quot; as Rae Ingram, the wife of a naval officer who is menaced by a castaway at sea, played by Billy Zane. The film proved to be her breakthrough role, and was one of the first films for which she gained international recognition. Regarding her performance, &quot;Variety&quot; commented how &quot;throughout the film, Kidman is excellent. She gives the character of Rae real tenacity and energy.&quot; Meanwhile, critic Roger Ebert noted the excellent chemistry between the leads, stating, &quot;Kidman and Zane do generate real, palpable hatred in their scenes together.&quot; She followed that up with the Australian miniseries &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot; before moving on to star alongside her then-boyfriend and future ex-husband, Tom Cruise, in the 1990 sports action film &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, as a young doctor who falls in love with a NASCAR driver. Considered to be her international breakout film, it was among the highest-grossing films of the year.

In 1991, Kidman co-starred alongside Thandiwe Newton and former classmate Naomi Watts in the Australian independent film &quot;Flirting&quot;. They portrayed high school girls in this coming of age story, which won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film. That same year, her work in the film &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; earned Kidman her first Golden Globe Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actress. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in its film review, called her &quot;a beauty with, it seems, a sense of humor&quot;. The following year, she and Cruise re-teamed for Ron Howard&#x27;s Irish epic &quot;Far and Away&quot; (1992), which was a modest critical and commercial success. In 1993, she starred in the thriller &quot;Malice&quot;, opposite Alec Baldwin, and the drama &quot;My Life&quot;, opposite Michael Keaton.

=== Critical acclaim and worldwide recognition (1995–2003) ===
In 1995, Kidman played Dr. Chase Meridian, the damsel in distress, in the superhero film &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, opposite Val Kilmer as the film&#x27;s title character. That same year, she starred in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s critically acclaimed dark comedy &quot;To Die For&quot;, in which she played the murderous newscaster Suzanne Stone. Regarding her performance, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said &quot;[she] brings to the role layers of meaning, intention and impulse. Telling her story in close-up – as she does throughout the film – Kidman lets you see the calculation, the wheels turning, the transparent efforts to charm that succeed in charming all the same.&quot; For her performance in the film, she received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. In the following years, she appeared alongside Barbara Hershey and John Malkovich in &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1996), based on the novel of the same name, and starred in &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; (1997) as nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly, opposite George Clooney. The latter film grossed US$110 million worldwide. In 1998, she starred alongside Sandra Bullock in the romantic comedy &quot;Practical Magic&quot; as two witch sisters who face a threatening curse that prevents them from finding lasting love. While the film opened at the top of the charts during its North American opening weekend, it was a commercial failure at the box-office. She returned to the stage that same year for the David Hare play &quot;The Blue Room&quot;, which opened in London. For her performance, she received a Laurence Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress.

In 1999, Kidman reunited with then-husband Tom Cruise to portray a couple on a sexual odyssey in &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, their third film together and the final film of director Stanley Kubrick. It was subject to censorship controversies due to the explicit nature of its sex scenes. After a brief hiatus and a highly publicised divorce from Cruise, Kidman returned to the screen to play a mail-order bride in the British-American drama &quot;Birthday Girl&quot;. In 2001, she took on the role of cabaret actress and courtesan Satine in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s musical &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, opposite Ewan McGregor. Her performance and her singing received positive reviews; Paul Clinton of CNN called it her best work since &quot;To Die For&quot;, and wrote &quot;[she] is smoldering and stunning as Satine. She moves with total confidence throughout the film ... Kidman seems to specialize in &#x27;ice queen&#x27; characters, but with Satine, she allows herself to thaw, just a bit.&quot; She subsequently received her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, among several other awards and nominations, including her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Also in 2001, Kidman starred in Alejandro Amenábar&#x27;s psychological horror film &quot;The Others&quot; (2001) as Grace Stewart, a mother living in the Channel Islands during World War II who suspects her house is haunted. Grossing over US$210 million worldwide, her performance earned her several award nominations, including a Goya Award nomination for Best Actress, in addition to receiving her second BAFTA Award and fifth Golden Globe Award nominations. Roger Ebert commented that &quot;Alejandro Amenábar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation, and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; highlighted Kidman&#x27;s performance, writing that she &quot;embodies this unstable amalgam with a conviction that is in itself terrifying. The icy reserve that sometimes stands in the way of her expressive gifts here becomes the foundation of her most emotionally layered performance to date.&quot;

The following year, Kidman garnered critical acclaim for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry&#x27;s &quot;The Hours&quot;, co-starring alongside Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Kidman wore prosthetics, which were applied to her nose, to portray the author during 1920s England, making her look almost unrecognisable. The film was a critical success, earning several awards and nominations, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain.&quot; She won numerous critic and industry awards for her performance, including her first BAFTA Award, third Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first Australian to win the award. During her Oscar&#x27;s acceptance speech, she referenced the Iraq War which was occurring at the time when speaking about the importance of art saying, &quot;Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. And because you believe in what you do and you want to honour that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld.&quot; That same year, she was named the World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Person by &quot;People&quot; magazine.

Following her Oscar win, Kidman appeared in three distinctly different films in 2003. The first of those, a leading role in director Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Dogville&quot;, was an experimental film set on a bare soundstage. Though the film divided critics in the United States, Kidman earned praise for her performance. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated, &quot;Kidman gives the most emotionally bruising performance of her career in &quot;Dogville&quot;, a movie that never met a cliche it didn&#x27;t stomp on.&quot; The second film was an adaptation of Philip Roth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Human Stain&quot;, opposite Anthony Hopkins. Her third film that year was Anthony Minghella&#x27;s war drama &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, where she starred opposite Jude Law and Renée Zellweger, playing southerner Ada Monroe, a woman who falls in love with Law&#x27;s character, and they become separated by the American Civil War. Regarding her performance, &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Kidman takes strength from Ada&#x27;s plight and grows steadily, literally luminous. Her sculptural pallor gives way to warm radiance in the firelight.&quot; The film garnered several awards and nominations, most notably for the performances of the cast, with Kidman receiving her sixth Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress.

===Established actress (2004–2009)===
In 2004, Kidman starred in the drama film &quot;Birth&quot;, which sparked controversy over a scene in which she shares a bath with her co-star Cameron Bright, then aged ten. During a press conference at the 61st Venice International Film Festival, she addressed the controversy saying, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t that I wanted to make a film where I kiss a 10-year-old boy. I wanted to make a film where you understand love.&quot; For her performance, she received her seventh Golden Globe nomination. That same year, she starred alongside Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Christopher Walken and Glenn Close in the black comedy science-fiction film &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;, a remake of the 1975 film of the same name, directed by Frank Oz. The following year, she starred opposite Sean Penn in the Sydney Pollack thriller &quot;The Interpreter&quot;, playing UN translator Silvia Broome, and starred alongside Will Ferrell in the romantic comedy &quot;Bewitched&quot;, based on the 1960s TV sitcom of the same name. While neither film fared well in the United States, both were international successes. For the latter film, she and Ferrell earned the Razzie Award for Worst Screen Couple.

In conjunction with her success within the film industry, Kidman became the face of the Chanel No. 5 perfume brand. She starred in a campaign of television and print ads with Rodrigo Santoro, directed by &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; director Baz Luhrmann, to promote the fragrance during the holiday seasons of 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2008. &quot;No. 5 the Film&quot;, a three-minute commercial produced for Chanel No. 5, made Kidman the record holder for the most money paid per minute to an actor after she reportedly earned US$12 million for the three-minute advert. During this time, she was also featured as the 45th Most Powerful Celebrity on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ 2005 Celebrity 100 List. She made a reported US$14.5 million between 2004 and 2005. On &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 2005&#x27;s highest-paid actresses, Kidman came in second behind Julia Roberts, with a US$16–17 million per-film price tag.

In 2006, Kidman portrayed photographer Diane Arbus in the biographical film &quot;Fur&quot;, opposite Robert Downey Jr., and lent her voice to the animated film &quot;Happy Feet&quot;, which grossed over US$384 million worldwide, becoming her highest-grossing film at the time. The following year, she starred in the science-fiction film &quot;The Invasion&quot;, a remake of the 1956 &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;, directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, and starred opposite Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jack Black in Noah Baumbach&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Margot at the Wedding&quot;, which earned her a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actress – Musical or Comedy. Also in 2007, she starred as the main antagonist Marisa Coulter in the fantasy-adventure film &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, which grossed over US$370 million worldwide, also becoming one of her highest-grossing films to date.

The following year, Kidman reunited with &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; director Baz Luhrmann for the Australian period film &quot;Australia&quot; (2008), set in the remote Northern Territory during the Japanese attack on Darwin during World War II. Starring opposite Hugh Jackman, she played an Englishwoman feeling overwhelmed by the continent. Though the film received mixed reviews from critics, it turned out to be a box office success, grossing over $211 million worldwide against a budget of $130 million. In 2009, she appeared in the Rob Marshall musical &quot;Nine&quot;, portraying the muse Claudia Jenssen, alongside an ensemble cast consisting of Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Fergie, Kate Hudson and Sophia Loren. Kidman, whose screen time was brief in comparison to the other actresses, performed the musical number &quot;Unusual Way&quot; alongside Day-Lewis. The film received several Golden Globe Award and Academy Award nominations, with Kidman earning her fourth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, as part of the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture award.

===Biographical and independent films (2010–2016)===
Kidman began the 2010s by producing and starring in the film adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot;, alongside Aaron Eckhart. Her performance as a grieving mother coping with the death of her son earned her critical acclaim, and she received nominations for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress. The following year, she appeared with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston in Dennis Dugan&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Just Go with It&quot;, as a trophy wife, and subsequently starred alongside Nicolas Cage in director Joel Schumacher&#x27;s action-thriller &quot;Trespass&quot;, with the stars playing a married couple taken hostage.

In 2012, Kidman starred alongside Clive Owen in the HBO film &quot;Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn&quot;, which depicted the relationship between journalist couple Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn. For her performance as Gellhorn, she received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie. That same year, she portrayed death row groupie Charlotte Bless in Lee Daniels&#x27; adaptation of the Pete Dexter novel, &quot;The Paperboy&quot; (2012). The film competed at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and Kidman&#x27;s performance garnered her nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award and the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress, in addition to her second Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, her tenth nomination overall. Also in 2012, her audiobook recording of Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; was released through Audible. The following year she starred as an unstable mother in Park Chan-wook&#x27;s &quot;Stoker&quot;, which was released to positive reception and a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In April 2013, she was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2014, Kidman starred as the titular character in the biographical film &quot;Grace of Monaco&quot;, which chronicles the 1962 crisis in which Charles de Gaulle blockaded the tiny principality, angered by Monaco&#x27;s status as a tax haven for wealthy French subjects and Kelly&#x27;s contemplative Hollywood return to star in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Marnie&quot;. Opening out of competition at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, the film received largely negative reviews. She also starred in two films with Colin Firth that year, the first being the British-Australian historical drama &quot;The Railway Man&quot;, in which she played an officer&#x27;s wife. Katherine Monk of the Montreal Gazette said of Kidman&#x27;s performance, &quot;It&#x27;s a truly masterful piece of acting that transcends Teplitzky&#x27;s store-bought framing, but it&#x27;s Kidman who delivers the biggest surprise: For the first time since her eyebrows turned into solid marble arches, the Australian Oscar winner is truly terrific&quot;. Her second film with Firth was the British thriller film &quot;Before I Go to Sleep&quot;, portraying a car crash survivor with brain damage. Also in 2014, she appeared in the live-action animated comedy film &quot;Paddington&quot; as the film&#x27;s main antagonist.

In 2015, Kidman starred in the drama &quot;Strangerland&quot;, which opened at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, and the Jason Bateman-directed &quot;The Family Fang&quot;, produced by Kidman&#x27;s production company, Blossom Films, which premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. In her other 2015 film release, the biographical drama &quot;Queen of the Desert&quot;, she portrayed writer, traveller, political officer, administrator and archaeologist Gertrude Bell. That same year, she played a district attorney, opposite Julia Roberts and Chiwetel Ejiofor, in the film &quot;Secret in Their Eyes&quot;, a remake of the 2009 Argentine film of the same name, both based on the novel &quot;La pregunta de sus ojos&quot; by author Eduardo Sacheri. After more than 15 years, she returned to the West End in the UK premiere of &quot;Photograph 51&quot; at the Noël Coward Theatre. She starred as British scientist Rosalind Franklin, working for the discovery of the structure of DNA, in the production from 5 September to 21 November 2015, directed by Michael Grandage. The production was met with considerable praise from critics, particularly for Kidman, and her return to the West End was hailed a success. For her performance, she won an Evening Standard Theatre Award and received a second Laurence Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress.
In 2016&#x27;s &quot;Lion&quot;, Kidman portrayed Sue, the adoptive mother of Saroo Brierley, an Indian boy who was separated from his birth family, a role she felt connected to as she herself is the mother of adopted children. She received positive reviews for her performance, in addition to her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, her fourth nomination overall, and her eleventh Golden Globe Award nomination, among several others. Richard Roeper of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; thought that &quot;Kidman gives a powerful and moving performance as Saroo&#x27;s adoptive mother, who loves her son with every molecule of her being, but comes to understand his quest. It&#x27;s as good as anything she&#x27;s done in the last decade.&quot; Budgeted at US$12 million, &quot;Lion&quot; earned over US$140 million globally. She also gave a voice-over performance for the English version of the animated film &quot;The Guardian Brothers&quot;.

===Television expansion and continued acclaim (2017–2020)===
In 2017, Kidman returned to television for &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, a drama series based on Liane Moriarty&#x27;s novel of the same name, which premiered on HBO. She also served as executive producer alongside her co-star, Reese Witherspoon, and the show&#x27;s director, Jean-Marc Vallée. She played Celeste Wright, a former lawyer and housewife, who conceals an abusive relationship with her husband, played by Alexander Skarsgård. Matthew Jacobs of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; considered that she &quot;delivered a career-defining performance&quot;, while Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;Kidman belongs in the pantheon of great actresses&quot;. She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her performance, as well as the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series as a producer. She also received a Screen Actors Guild Award, two Critics&#x27; Choice Television Awards and two Golden Globe Awards for her work in the show.

Kidman next played Martha Farnsworth, the headmistress of an all-girls school during the American Civil War, in Sofia Coppola&#x27;s drama &quot;The Beguiled&quot;, a remake of the 1971 film of the same name, which premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, competing for the Palme d&#x27;Or. Both films were adaptations of a novel by Thomas P. Cullinan. The film was an arthouse success, and Katie Walsh of the &quot;Tribune News Service&quot; found Kidman &quot;particularly, unsurprisingly excellent in her performance as the steely Miss Martha. She is controlled and in control, unflappable. Her genteel manners and femininity co-exist easily with her toughness.&quot; Kidman had two other films premiere at the festival: the science-fiction romantic comedy &quot;How to Talk to Girls at Parties&quot;, reuniting her with director John Cameron Mitchell, and the psychological thriller &quot;The Killing of a Sacred Deer&quot;, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, which also competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or. Also in 2017, she played supporting roles in the BBC Two television series &quot;Top of the Lake: China Girl&quot; and in the comedy-drama &quot;The Upside&quot;, a remake of the 2011 French comedy &quot;The Intouchables&quot;, starring Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart.

In 2018, Kidman starred in two dramas, &quot;Destroyer&quot; and &quot;Boy Erased&quot;. In the former, she played a detective troubled by a case for two decades. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; and Brooke Marine of &quot;W&quot; both found her &quot;unrecognizable&quot; in the role and Debruge added that &quot;she disappears into an entirely new skin, rearranging her insides to fit the character&#x27;s tough hide&quot;, whereas Marine highlighted Kidman&#x27;s method acting. The latter film is based on Garrard Conley&#x27;s &quot;Boy Erased: A Memoir&quot;, and features Russell Crowe and Kidman as socially conservative parents who send their son (played by Lucas Hedges) to a gay conversion program. Richard Lawson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; credited all three performers for &quot;elevating the fairly standard-issue material to poignant highs&quot;. That same year, Kidman took on the role of Queen Atlanna, the mother of the title character, in the DC Extended Universe superhero film &quot;Aquaman&quot;, which grossed over US$1.1 billion worldwide, becoming her highest-grossing film to date. Also in 2018, she was interviewed for a BAFTA event &quot;A Life in Pictures&quot;, where she reflected on her extensive film career.

&quot;Forbes&quot; ranked her as the fourth highest-paid actress in the world in 2019, with an annual income of $34 million. Kidman kicked off 2019 by reprising her role in the second season of the hit series &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, which premiered in June. The second season not only drew a larger audience than the first but also became the most-watched night of viewing for an HBO original series that year. In September 2019, she took on the supporting part of a rich socialite in John Crowley&#x27;s drama &quot;The Goldfinch&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Donna Tartt, starring Ansel Elgort. Although it was poorly received, Owen Gleiberman commended Kidman for playing her part with &quot;elegant affection&quot;. She next co-starred alongside Charlize Theron and Margot Robbie in the drama &quot;Bombshell&quot;, a film depicting the scandal concerning the sexual harassment accusations against former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, in which she portrayed journalist Gretchen Carlson. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that despite lesser screen time than her two co-protagonists, Kidman successfully made Carlson &quot;ever-so-slightly ridiculous, adding a sharp sliver of comedy that underscores how self-serving and futile her rebellious gestures at the network are&quot;. For her performance, she received an additional Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role.
Kidman started off the 2020s with her role of Grace Fraser, a successful New York therapist, in the HBO psychological thriller miniseries &quot;The Undoing&quot;, based on the novel &quot;You Should Have Known&quot; by Jean Hanff Korelitz. She served as executive producer alongside the show&#x27;s director, Susanne Bier, and David E. Kelley, who previously adapted and produced &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;. Throughout its season, the series gained increasing momentum and broke records. HBO celebrated a historic achievement as the show became the network&#x27;s first original series to increase its viewership consistently week by week. The finale marked the most-watched night on HBO since the season 2 finale of &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;. Furthermore, the series surpassed &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; to become HBO&#x27;s most-watched show of 2020 based on audience numbers. For her performance, she received additional Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. Her only film release of 2020 was the musical comedy &quot;The Prom&quot;, based on the Broadway musical of the same name, starring alongside Meryl Streep, James Corden and Keegan-Michael Key.

===Television and independent films (2021–present)===
In August 2021, she starred and served as executive producer on the Hulu drama series &quot;Nine Perfect Strangers&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by Liane Moriarty. Despite receiving mixed reviews, it was reported that the premiere of the show became the most-watched Hulu original on its premiere day and continued to hold that title after five days on the service. That same year, she portrayed actress-comedian Lucille Ball alongside Javier Bardem as Ball&#x27;s husband, Desi Arnaz, in the biographical drama &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot;, directed by Aaron Sorkin. Despite unfavourable reactions in response to her casting as Ball, her portrayal was met with critical acclaim. She subsequently won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance, in addition to receiving nominations for the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, as well as her fourth Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, her fifth nomination overall.

In September 2021, Kidman starred in a commercial for AMC Theatres entitled &quot;We Make Movies Better&quot;, which would play before every film in the theatres owned by the chain beginning that month and Kidman&#x27;s sponsorship was later extended for another year in August 2022. The commercial and Kidman&#x27;s delivery of her speech proved popular with audiences who viewed it as a way to drive moviegoers back to seeing films theatrically in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. AMC&#x27;s CEO Adam Aron described Kidman&#x27;s viral ad as &quot;iconic and revered&quot; during a 2022 earnings call and CNN reported that the ad &quot;has inspired memes, homages and debate&quot; and became a &quot;cultural thing&quot;.
In April 2022, Kidman appeared in an episode of the anthology series &quot;Roar&quot;, based on Cecelia Ahern&#x27;s 2018 short story collection, in addition to serving as executive producer. The miniseries attracted mixed attention due to its unconventional and controversial feminist themes. That same month, she starred alongside her &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; co-star Alexander Skarsgård, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe in the historical drama &quot;The Northman&quot;, directed by Robert Eggers. The film was received with widespread acclaim upon its release.

In 2023, Kidman began starring in the Paramount+ television series &quot;Special Ops: Lioness&quot;, on which she also serves as an executive producer. The miniseries received mixed attention upon release and reviewer Anita Singh of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; criticised &quot;the one thing that lets the show down is Nicole Kidman as a CIA boss, whose frozen face these days is a total distraction&quot;. Initially, reviewer Mike Hale, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, remarked that the show resembled many other counterterrorism thrillers, noting its visceral action and somewhat artificial setting in the first episode. However, upon further reflection, he found that the show evolved into a moody, suspenseful, and intricately crafted genre piece with compelling characters. In December 2023, Kidman reprised the role of Queen Atlanna in the sequel to the 2018 superhero film &quot;Aquaman&quot;, titled &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&quot;.

In January 2024, Kidman starred in and served as executive producer of the drama television series &quot;Expats.&quot; Her performance garnered mixed reviews from critics. In June 2024, she reunited with her &quot;The Paperboy&quot; co-star Zac Efron in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;A Family Affair&quot;. Although it received mixed reviews from critics, the film was well received by audiences. It achieved the #1 spot among Netflix originals during its first weekend and maintained a strong position at #2 on the second weekend of its release. Kidman portrayed a high-ranking CEO in the A24 erotic thriller &quot;Babygirl&quot; written and directed by Halina Reijn. Robbie Collin of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; highlighted Kidman&#x27;s work as &quot;ferociously good, convincing utterly as this formerly level-headed careerist whose deeply buried, long-denied appetites are simultaneously proving her making and downfall.&quot; For her performance, she received the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 81st Venice International Film Festival. Kidman was absent from the ceremony due to the death of her mother. She was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and subsequently earned her first Best Actress win at National Board of Review Awards for her performance.

In September 2024, Kidman starred in, and served as executive producer on the Netflix series &quot;The Perfect Couple&quot;, based on Elin Hilderbrand&#x27;s novel. The series received mixed reviews from critics with many reviews criticizing Kidman for her constantly repeating herself. However, it became Netflix&#x27;s global hit leading the charts for two consecutive weeks before dropping but still maintaining strong positions for the following weeks. In October 2024, Kidman starred in the second season of the television series &quot;Lioness&quot;, on which she earned a nomination for Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and was executive producer. In November 2024, Kidman was voiced Queen Ellsmere in the animated fantasy film &quot;Spellbound&quot;. The film received mixed reviews mainly for its subject matter; however, it managed to place #3 and #2 position in Netflix&#x27;s top series for the first and second week since its release.

In March 2025, Kidman will star as Nancy, a teacher in Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Holland&quot; directed by Mimi Cave. Kidman is also set to star in, and serve as executive producer on, numerous projects, including the Australian television series &quot;The Last Anniversary&quot;, adapted from Liane Moriarty&#x27;s novel, and an Amazon Prime Video &quot;Scarpetta&quot; series based on Patricia Cornwell&#x27;s Kay Scarpetta novels. 

==Reception and legacy==
Kidman is often regarded to be among the finest actresses of her generation. She is also considered one of Hollywood’s bravest performers. She has been noted for seeking eccentric roles in risky projects helmed by auteurs, as well as for her volatile performances and versatile work, having appeared in a variety of eclectic films from several genres throughout her extensive career spanning nearly four decades. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; stated that, despite struggling with her personal life being publicly scrutinised by the media during the early years of her career, &quot;[Kidman] has shown herself to be a major talent, a remarkable actress who can get in there with the best of them, go toe-to-toe, and come out with her credibility intact. What&#x27;s more, she&#x27;s proved herself to be a star with a capital S, the one-in-a-generation kind who, like Elizabeth Taylor, is bigger than the Hollywood system, and is also unafraid to be human and real, which only makes her more popular.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;the plucky, disciplined indomitability she brings to her performances, even more than the artistry she displays within them, may be the secret of her appeal, the source of her bond with the audience.&quot; Emily Nussbaum of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; commented how &quot;in each role, there is something waxen and watchful and self-possessed about Kidman, so that, even when she&#x27;s smiling, she never seems liberated. While other actors specialize in transparency, Kidman has a different gift: she can wear a mask and simultaneously let you feel what it&#x27;s like to hide behind it.&quot; Kidman’s most remarkable accomplishment lies in her ability to consistently deliver surprising performances, often standing out as the highlight even in otherwise lackluster projects. She remains a captivating figure, sparking more conversation and strong opinions than nearly anyone else in the industry. Leila Latif of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that Kidman continuously proved again and again &quot;why she is one of Hollywood’s best and subtly ­most transgressive stars.&quot; In 2004 and 2018, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Kidman one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual &quot;Time&quot; 100 list. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked her fifth on its list of the greatest actors of the 21st century, and in a 2022 readers&#x27; poll by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, she was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time. In 2025, Kidman was named one of the Women of the Year of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Kidman continues to defy age-related stereotypes in Hollywood, thriving in an industry often criticized for its challenges for women over 50. Her ability to secure leading roles and produce compelling work highlights her resilience and determination, proving that age is no barrier to success in her career. Kidman’s journey inspires, challenging the industry’s norms and paving the way for other women in Hollywood.

Kidman is known to practice method acting for many of her roles. It has been noted that she oftentimes transforms herself physically, mentally and emotionally to resemble her characters, to the point where it has adversely affected her health. Mark Caro from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that &quot;to Nicole Kidman, acting isn&#x27;t a mere technical feat; it&#x27;s the art of transformation. To hear her tell it, the change can be as dramatic as a caterpillar-into-butterfly metamorphosis. She&#x27;ll be working and working to get under the skin of a character.&quot; &quot;W&quot; described her as a &quot;cipher&quot;, and pointed out how &quot;she gets under her character&#x27;s skin so thoroughly, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to distinguish the actress from the role. It&#x27;s why she has become so synonymous with a few key roles ... and why those films are so defined by Kidman&#x27;s presence in them.&quot;

Scholars have also commented on her acting style and approach to roles. Sharon Marie Carnicke, a professor of critical studies and acting at the USC School of Dramatic Arts, mentioned that &quot;Kidman&#x27;s [acting] choices are believable and natural as reactions to the specific circumstances in her world&quot; and described her work as &quot;kinetic&quot;. Dennis Bingham, a professor of English and director of film studies at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, stated that &quot;Kidman acts always a step or two outside the character, telegraphing her reactions, elongating the time she takes to articulate her decisions and conclusions. Even her emotional responses are presented as signs.&quot; Pam Cook, a professor of film at the University of Southampton, suggests in her biography of Kidman that &quot;her emphasis on artifice and technique points to a conception of screen acting that looks to cinematic expression rather than to the actor&#x27;s body and intentions for the realisation of character.&quot; Mary Luckhurst, a professor and head of the University of Bristol School of Arts with credentials in theatre and performance, stated how &quot;she has strategically pursued a high-risk mutability and versatility, and regularly traverses between naturalist and non-naturalist roles and artforms.&quot; She continues saying that &quot;she can continually test her own emotional limits, physical skills, politics, values and frames of reference&quot; and mentions how &quot;her conception of character acting involves metamorphosing gradually into something that she feels is so &#x27;other&#x27; that she frequently speaks of losing herself or getting lost in the role, and her preparedness to challenge herself in this respect has continually surprised other actors, directors and producers.&quot;

After nearly four decades in the industry and over 80 film and TV projects, Kidman emphasizes her acting approach, saying, &quot;I still approach acting like I’ve just come out of drama school.&quot;

Arte France released a 53-minute documentary in 2023, &quot;Nicole Kidman – Eyes Wide Open&quot;.

Kidman has also been described as a fashion icon. The chartreuse Dior gown she wore to the 1997 Academy Awards is regarded as one of the greatest dresses in Oscar history and has been credited with changing red carpet fashion forever. &quot;Vogue&quot; described how &quot;from her embroidered chartreuse John Galliano for Christian Dior gown in 1997, at the side of then-husband Tom Cruise, to that impeccable red Balenciaga moment at the 2007 Oscars, to the unforgettable Calvin Klein ballerina dress she wore to the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, the Australian native has mastered the art of red carpet dressing, always piquing our [interest] and taking risks while never overdoing it.&quot; &quot;Insider&quot; stated that &quot;over the years, Kidman has experimented with all sorts of trends, including bold colors, statement jewelry, and everything in between, making herself one of the most iconic celebrities when it comes to her fashion choices.&quot; In 2003, she received the Fashion Icon Award, which was awarded to her by the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Regarding her bestowal, Peter Arnold, executive director of the CFDA, said, &quot;Nicole Kidman&#x27;s style, both on and off the screen, has had an undeniable impact on fashion. As an actress, she has developed her many memorable characters with an innate understanding of the artistry of clothes. At the same time, she has elegantly established her personal style and own iconic presence worldwide.&quot;

==Working with female filmmakers==
In 2017, Kidman has pledged to collaborate with a female director every 18 months to address gender disparities in the film industry. This commitment has led to her involvement in numerous projects, including &quot;The Perfect Couple&quot; where she portrays Greer Garrison Winbury, a role reminiscent of her previous characters in &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; and &quot;The Undoing&quot;. Some critics argued that such choices resulted in repetitive portrayals, potentially diminishing the impact of her performances. 
Though Kidman’s recent roles often portray wealthy, sophisticated women, each character reveals unique emotional complexities. From hidden grief and buried secrets to self-sacrifice or the pursuit of personal desires, Kidman adds depth and nuance to these archetypes, demonstrating her range and versatility as an actress.
Despite criticisms, Kidman continues to support female filmmakers, contributing to increased representation in the industry and creating more jobs. As of November 2024, Kidman had worked with 15 female directors over the previous seven years.

In a February 2025 interview with &quot;Time&quot;, she reflected on her career, emphasizing the importance of humility, continuous learning, and taking risks in her craft. Kidman also highlighted her commitment to telling diverse stories and supporting female filmmakers, aiming to create more opportunities for women in the industry. Her efforts have elevated her career and inspired a new generation of talent, solidifying her legacy as both an artist and a trailblazer.

Halina Reijn, director of &quot;Babygirl&quot;, highlighted her experience with Kidman, stating, &quot;She is one of the few people who practices what she preaches when it comes to feminism and empowering women.&quot; Mimi Cave, director of &quot;Holland&quot;, reflected on working with Kidman, saying that she &quot;makes herself completely available to you as a director&quot; and praising her collaborative spirit. She added, &quot;She&#x27;s really incredible to watch and she&#x27;s someone I&#x27;ve learned a great deal from. It was a pretty magnificent experience for me,&quot; underscoring Kidman&#x27;s professionalism and the lasting impression she leaves on collaborators. Lulu Wang, director of &quot;Expats&quot;, praised Kidman, stating, &quot;Nicole, being able to support me, created this entire network and world of filmmakers, women, people of color who’ve never had the opportunity to be in this space.&quot; Jamie Lee Curtis, Kidman&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Scarpetta&quot;, shared that &quot;People work when Nicole works. I’m working because Nicole is working.&quot;

As of February 2025, Kidman has worked with 19 female directors, either in an acting or producing capacity, over the past eight years to champion gender equality in Hollywood.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships and family ===
Kidman met actor Tom Cruise in 1989 while working on the set of &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, a film in which both starred, and they married on Christmas Eve of 1990 in Colorado. While married, the couple adopted a daughter, Isabella (born 1992), and a son, Connor (born 1995). On 5 February 2001, the couple&#x27;s spokesperson announced their separation. Cruise filed for divorce two days later, and their marriage was dissolved later that year, with Cruise citing irreconcilable differences. In 2013, Kidman said their marriage failed because of her young age when they married. &quot;I was a child, really, when I got married,&quot; she said. &quot;And I needed to grow up.&quot; In a 2007 interview with &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, Kidman noted the incorrect reporting of a miscarriage early in her marriage: &quot;It was wrongly reported as miscarriage by everyone who picked up the story. So it&#x27;s huge news, and it didn&#x27;t happen. I had a miscarriage at the end of my marriage, but I had an ectopic pregnancy at the beginning of my marriage.&quot;

In the June 2006 issue of &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, Kidman revealed that she still loved Cruise despite their divorce: &quot;He was huge; still is. To me, he was just Tom, but to everybody else, he is huge. But he was lovely to me and I loved him. I still love him&quot;. In addition, she expressed shock about the divorce. In 2015, former Church of Scientology executive Mark Rathbun claimed in a documentary film that he was instructed to &quot;facilitate [Cruise&#x27;s] break-up with Nicole Kidman&quot;. Cruise&#x27;s auditor further claimed Kidman had been wiretapped on Cruise&#x27;s suggestion. In an interview with Tina Brown at the 2015 Women in the World conference, she expressed that the attention surrounding her at the time of her divorce from Cruise led to increased public attention to her career, stating, &quot;Out of my divorce came work that was applauded, so that was an interesting thing for me.&quot; She went on to receive an Academy Award in 2003, shortly after her divorce.

Prior to marrying Cruise, Kidman had been involved in relationships with Australian actor Marcus Graham and &quot;Windrider&quot; co-star Tom Burlinson. The film &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; brought rumours that an affair between Kidman and co-star Jude Law was responsible for the break-up of his marriage. Both denied the allegations, and Kidman won an undisclosed sum from the British tabloids that published the story. She began dating musician Lenny Kravitz in 2003. During an interview for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 2007, Kidman mentioned that she had been secretly engaged to someone, later revealed to have been Kravitz, but they ultimately decided to break off their engagement. However, they remain on good terms. Kravitz&#x27;s daughter, Zoë Kravitz, later said that Kidman was a loving potential stepmother to her. In 2003, she briefly dated A Tribe Called Quest rapper Q-Tip.

In January 2005, Kidman met Australian-American country singer Keith Urban at G&#x27;Day LA, an event honouring Australians. In May 2006, she revealed they were engaged. Kidman married Urban on 25 June 2006 at Cardinal Cerretti Memorial Chapel on the grounds of St Patrick&#x27;s Estate, Manly, in Sydney. For their honeymoon, they went to French Polynesia. In a 2015 interview, regarding her relationship with Urban, Kidman said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t really know each other – we got to know each other during our marriage.&quot; Urban has credited Kidman for helping him overcome his struggles with alcohol addiction. They maintain homes in Nashville (Tennessee, US), Beverly Hills (California, US), two apartments in Sydney (New South Wales, Australia), a farmhouse in Sutton Forest (New South Wales, Australia), and an apartment in Manhattan (New York, US). The couple&#x27;s first daughter (Sunday Rose) was born in 2008, in Nashville. In 2010, Kidman and Urban welcomed their second daughter (Faith Margaret) via gestational surrogacy at Nashville&#x27;s Centennial Women&#x27;s Hospital.

=== Religious beliefs and political views ===
Kidman was brought up in a Catholic family and remains practising. She attended Mary Mackillop Memorial Chapel and Museum in North Sydney. Following criticism by Catholic leaders regarding her role in &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; as anti-Catholic, Kidman told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that the source material had been &quot;watered down a little&quot; and that her religious beliefs would prevent her from taking a role in a film she perceived as anti-Catholic. Since her divorce from Tom Cruise, she has been reluctant to discuss Scientology.

A supporter of women&#x27;s rights, Kidman testified before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs to support the International Violence Against Women Act in 2009. In January 2017, she stated her support for the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Australia. Kidman has also donated to US Democratic party candidates.

Kidman was also appointed Goodwill ambassador of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) in 2006.

<text>Nucleotides are organic molecules composed of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar and a phosphate. They serve as monomeric units of the nucleic acid polymers – deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which are essential biomolecules within all life-forms on Earth. Nucleotides are obtained in the diet and are also synthesized from common nutrients by the liver.

Nucleotides are composed of three subunit molecules: a nucleobase, a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and a phosphate group consisting of one to three phosphates. The four nucleobases in DNA are guanine, adenine, cytosine, and thymine; in RNA, uracil is used in place of thymine.

Nucleotides also play a central role in metabolism at a fundamental, cellular level. They provide chemical energy—in the form of the nucleoside triphosphates, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), cytidine triphosphate (CTP), and uridine triphosphate (UTP)—throughout the cell for the many cellular functions that demand energy, including: amino acid, protein and cell membrane synthesis, moving the cell and cell parts (both internally and intercellularly), cell division, etc.. In addition, nucleotides participate in cell signaling (cyclic guanosine monophosphate or cGMP and cyclic adenosine monophosphate or cAMP) and are incorporated into important cofactors of enzymatic reactions (e.g., coenzyme A, FAD, FMN, NAD, and NADP+).

In experimental biochemistry, nucleotides can be radiolabeled using radionuclides to yield radionucleotides.

5-nucleotides are also used in flavour enhancers as food additive to enhance the umami taste, often in the form of a yeast extract.

== Structure ==
A nucleotide is composed of three distinctive chemical sub-units: a five-carbon sugar molecule, a nucleobase (the two of which together are called a nucleoside), and one phosphate group. With all three joined, a nucleotide is also termed a &quot;nucleoside &quot;mono&quot;phosphate&quot;, &quot;nucleoside &quot;di&quot;phosphate&quot; or &quot;nucleoside &quot;tri&quot;phosphate&quot;, depending on how many phosphates make up the phosphate group.

In nucleic acids, nucleotides contain either a purine or a pyrimidine base—i.e., the nucleobase molecule, also known as a nitrogenous base—and are termed &quot;ribo&quot;nucleotides if the sugar is ribose, or &quot;deoxyribo&quot;nucleotides if the sugar is deoxyribose. Individual phosphate molecules repetitively connect the sugar-ring molecules in two adjacent nucleotide monomers, thereby connecting the nucleotide monomers of a nucleic acid end-to-end into a long chain. These chain-joins of sugar and phosphate molecules create a &#x27;backbone&#x27; strand for a single- or double helix. In any one strand, the chemical orientation (directionality) of the chain-joins runs from the 5&#x27;-end to the 3&#x27;-end (&quot;read&quot;: 5 prime-end to 3 prime-end)—referring to the five carbon sites on sugar molecules in adjacent nucleotides. In a double helix, the two strands are oriented in opposite directions, which permits base pairing and complementarity between the base-pairs, all which is essential for replicating or transcribing the encoded information found in DNA.

Nucleic acids then are polymeric macromolecules assembled from nucleotides, the monomer-units of nucleic acids. The purine bases adenine and guanine and pyrimidine base cytosine occur in both DNA and RNA, while the pyrimidine bases thymine (in DNA) and uracil (in RNA) occur in just one. Adenine forms a base pair with thymine with two hydrogen bonds, while guanine pairs with cytosine with three hydrogen bonds.

In addition to being building blocks for the construction of nucleic acid polymers, singular nucleotides play roles in cellular energy storage and provision, cellular signaling, as a source of phosphate groups used to modulate the activity of proteins and other signaling molecules, and as enzymatic cofactors, often carrying out redox reactions. Signaling cyclic nucleotides are formed by binding the phosphate group twice to the same sugar molecule, bridging the 5&#x27;- and 3&#x27;- hydroxyl groups of the sugar. Some signaling nucleotides differ from the standard single-phosphate group configuration, in having multiple phosphate groups attached to different positions on the sugar. Nucleotide cofactors include a wider range of chemical groups attached to the sugar via the glycosidic bond, including nicotinamide and flavin, and in the latter case, the ribose sugar is linear rather than forming the ring seen in other nucleotides.


==Synthesis==
Nucleotides can be synthesized by a variety of means, both in vitro and in vivo.

In vitro, protecting groups may be used during laboratory production of nucleotides. A purified nucleoside is protected to create a phosphoramidite, which can then be used to obtain analogues not found in nature and/or to synthesize an oligonucleotide.

In vivo, nucleotides can be synthesized de novo or recycled through salvage pathways. The components used in de novo nucleotide synthesis are derived from biosynthetic precursors of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, and from ammonia and carbon dioxide. Recently it has been also demonstrated that cellular bicarbonate metabolism can be regulated by mTORC1 signaling. The liver is the major organ of de novo synthesis of all four nucleotides. De novo synthesis of pyrimidines and purines follows two different pathways. Pyrimidines are synthesized first from aspartate and carbamoyl-phosphate in the cytoplasm to the common precursor ring structure orotic acid, onto which a phosphorylated ribosyl unit is covalently linked. Purines, however, are first synthesized from the sugar template onto which the ring synthesis occurs. For reference, the syntheses of the purine and pyrimidine nucleotides are carried out by several enzymes in the cytoplasm of the cell, not within a specific organelle. Nucleotides undergo breakdown such that useful parts can be reused in synthesis reactions to create new nucleotides.

===Pyrimidine ribonucleotide synthesis===
The synthesis of the pyrimidines CTP and UTP occurs in the cytoplasm and starts with the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine and CO2. Next, aspartate carbamoyltransferase catalyzes a condensation reaction between aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form carbamoyl aspartic acid, which is cyclized into 4,5-dihydroorotic acid by dihydroorotase. The latter is converted to orotate by dihydroorotate oxidase. The net reaction is:

:(&quot;S&quot;)-Dihydroorotate + O2 → Orotate + H2O2

Orotate is covalently linked with a phosphorylated ribosyl unit. The covalent linkage between the ribose and pyrimidine occurs at position C1 of the ribose unit, which contains a pyrophosphate, and N1 of the pyrimidine ring. Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (PRPP transferase) catalyzes the net reaction yielding orotidine monophosphate (OMP):

:Orotate + 5-Phospho-α-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) → Orotidine 5&#x27;-phosphate + Pyrophosphate

Orotidine 5&#x27;-monophosphate is decarboxylated by orotidine-5&#x27;-phosphate decarboxylase to form uridine monophosphate (UMP). PRPP transferase catalyzes both the ribosylation and decarboxylation reactions, forming UMP from orotic acid in the presence of PRPP. It is from UMP that other pyrimidine nucleotides are derived. UMP is phosphorylated by two kinases to uridine triphosphate (UTP) via two sequential reactions with ATP. First, the diphosphate from UDP is produced, which in turn is phosphorylated to UTP. Both steps are fueled by ATP hydrolysis:

:ATP + UMP → ADP + UDP

:UDP + ATP → UTP + ADP

CTP is subsequently formed by the amination of UTP by the catalytic activity of CTP synthetase. Glutamine is the NH3 donor and the reaction is fueled by ATP hydrolysis, too:

:UTP + Glutamine + ATP + H2O → CTP + ADP + Pi

Cytidine monophosphate (CMP) is derived from cytidine triphosphate (CTP) with subsequent loss of two phosphates.

===Purine ribonucleotide synthesis===

The atoms that are used to build the purine nucleotides come from a variety of sources:

The de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides by which these precursors are incorporated into the purine ring proceeds by a 10-step pathway to the branch-point intermediate IMP, the nucleotide of the base hypoxanthine. AMP and GMP are subsequently synthesized from this intermediate via separate, two-step pathways. Thus, purine moieties are initially formed as part of the ribonucleotides rather than as free bases.

Six enzymes take part in IMP synthesis. Three of them are multifunctional:
* GART (reactions 2, 3, and 5)
* PAICS (reactions 6, and 7)
* ATIC (reactions 9, and 10)

The pathway starts with the formation of PRPP. PRPS1 is the enzyme that activates R5P, which is formed primarily by the pentose phosphate pathway, to PRPP by reacting it with ATP. The reaction is unusual in that a pyrophosphoryl group is directly transferred from ATP to C1 of R5P and that the product has the α configuration about C1. This reaction is also shared with the pathways for the synthesis of Trp, His, and the pyrimidine nucleotides. Being on a major metabolic crossroad and requiring much energy, this reaction is highly regulated.

In the first reaction unique to purine nucleotide biosynthesis, PPAT catalyzes the displacement of PRPP&#x27;s pyrophosphate group (PPi) by an amide nitrogen donated from either glutamine (N), glycine (N&amp;C), aspartate (N), folic acid (C1), or CO2. This is the committed step in purine synthesis. The reaction occurs with the inversion of configuration about ribose C1, thereby forming β-5-phosphorybosylamine (5-PRA) and establishing the anomeric form of the future nucleotide.

Next, a glycine is incorporated fueled by ATP hydrolysis, and the carboxyl group forms an amine bond to the NH2 previously introduced. A one-carbon unit from folic acid coenzyme N10-formyl-THF is then added to the amino group of the substituted glycine followed by the closure of the imidazole ring. Next, a second NH2 group is transferred from glutamine to the first carbon of the glycine unit. A carboxylation of the second carbon of the glycin unit is concomitantly added. This new carbon is modified by the addition of a third NH2 unit, this time transferred from an aspartate residue. Finally, a second one-carbon unit from formyl-THF is added to the nitrogen group and the ring is covalently closed to form the common purine precursor inosine monophosphate (IMP).

Inosine monophosphate is converted to adenosine monophosphate in two steps. First, GTP hydrolysis fuels the addition of aspartate to IMP by adenylosuccinate synthase, substituting the carbonyl oxygen for a nitrogen and forming the intermediate adenylosuccinate. Fumarate is then cleaved off forming adenosine monophosphate. This step is catalyzed by adenylosuccinate lyase.

Inosine monophosphate is converted to guanosine monophosphate by the oxidation of IMP forming xanthylate, followed by the insertion of an amino group at C2. NAD+ is the electron acceptor in the oxidation reaction. The amide group transfer from glutamine is fueled by ATP hydrolysis.

===Pyrimidine and purine degradation===
In humans, pyrimidine rings (C, T, U) can be degraded completely to CO2 and NH3 (urea excretion). That having been said, purine rings (G, A) cannot. Instead, they are degraded to the metabolically inert uric acid which is then excreted from the body. Uric acid is formed when GMP is split into the base guanine and ribose. Guanine is deaminated to xanthine which in turn is oxidized to uric acid. This last reaction is irreversible. Similarly, uric acid can be formed when AMP is deaminated to IMP from which the ribose unit is removed to form hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is oxidized to xanthine and finally to uric acid. Instead of uric acid secretion, guanine and IMP can be used for recycling purposes and nucleic acid synthesis in the presence of PRPP and aspartate (NH3 donor).

==Prebiotic synthesis of nucleotides==
Theories about the origin of life require knowledge of chemical pathways that permit formation of life&#x27;s key building blocks under plausible prebiotic conditions. The RNA world hypothesis holds that in the primordial soup there existed free-floating ribonucleotides, the fundamental molecules that combine in series to form RNA. Complex molecules like RNA must have arisen from small molecules whose reactivity was governed by physico-chemical processes. RNA is composed of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, both of which are necessary for reliable information transfer, and thus Darwinian evolution. Becker et al. showed how pyrimidine nucleosides can be synthesized from small molecules and ribose, driven solely by wet-dry cycles. Purine nucleosides can be synthesized by a similar pathway. 5&#x27;-mono- and di-phosphates also form selectively from phosphate-containing minerals, allowing concurrent formation of polyribonucleotides with both the purine and pyrimidine bases. Thus a reaction network towards the purine and pyrimidine RNA building blocks can be established starting from simple atmospheric or volcanic molecules.

==Unnatural base pair (UBP)==
An unnatural base pair (UBP) is a designed subunit (or nucleobase) of DNA which is created in a laboratory and does not occur in nature. Examples include d5SICS and dNaM. These artificial nucleotides bearing hydrophobic nucleobases, feature two fused aromatic rings that form a (d5SICS–dNaM) complex or base pair in DNA. &quot;E. coli&quot; have been induced to replicate a plasmid containing UBPs through multiple generations. This is the first known example of a living organism passing along an expanded genetic code to subsequent generations.

==Medical applications of synthetic nucleotides==
The applications of synthetic nucleotides vary widely and include disease diagnosis, treatment, or precision medicine. 

# Antiviral or Antiretroviral agents: several nucleotide derivatives have been used in the treatment against infection with Hepatitis and HIV. Examples of direct nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) include Tenofovir disoproxil, Tenofovir alafenamide, and Sofosbuvir. On the other hand, agents such as Mericitabine, Lamivudine, Entecavir and Telbivudine must first undergo metabolization via phosphorylation to become activated. 
# Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO): synthetic oligonucleotides have been used in the treatment of rare heritable diseases since they can bind specific RNA transcripts and ultimately modulate protein expression. Spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and primary hyperoxaluria type 1 are all amenable to ASO-based therapy. The application of oligonucleotides is a new frontier in precision medicine and management of conditions which are untreatable.
# Synthetic guide RNA (gRNA): synthetic nucleotides can be used to design gRNA which are essential for the proper function of gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9. 

== Length unit ==
Nucleotide (abbreviated &quot;nt&quot;) is a common unit of length for single-stranded nucleic acids, similar to how base pair is a unit of length for double-stranded nucleic acids.

== Abbreviation codes for degenerate bases ==

The IUPAC has designated the symbols for nucleotides. Apart from the five (A, G, C, T/U) bases, often degenerate bases are used especially for designing PCR primers. These nucleotide codes are listed here. Some primer sequences may also include the character &quot;I&quot;, which codes for the non-standard nucleotide inosine. Inosine occurs in tRNAs and will pair with adenine, cytosine, or thymine. This character does not appear in the following table, however, because it does not represent a degeneracy. While inosine can serve a similar function as the degeneracy &quot;H&quot;, it is an actual nucleotide, rather than a representation of a mix of nucleotides that covers each possible pairing needed.

<text>Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis (as distinguished from discrete mathematics). It is the study of numerical methods that attempt to find approximate solutions of problems rather than the exact ones. Numerical analysis finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, and in the 21st century also the life and social sciences like economics, medicine, business and even the arts. Current growth in computing power has enabled the use of more complex numerical analysis, providing detailed and realistic mathematical models in science and engineering. Examples of numerical analysis include: ordinary differential equations as found in celestial mechanics (predicting the motions of planets, stars and galaxies), numerical linear algebra in data analysis, and stochastic differential equations and Markov chains for simulating living cells in medicine and biology.

Before modern computers, numerical methods often relied on hand interpolation formulas, using data from large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead, but many of the same formulas continue to be used in software algorithms.

The numerical point of view goes back to the earliest mathematical writings. A tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection (YBC 7289), gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of the square root of 2, the length of the diagonal in a unit square.

Numerical analysis continues this long tradition: rather than giving exact symbolic answers translated into digits and applicable only to real-world measurements, approximate solutions within specified error bounds are used.

==Applications==
The overall goal of the field of numerical analysis is the design and analysis of techniques to give approximate but accurate solutions to a wide variety of hard problems, many of which are infeasible to solve symbolically:

* Advanced numerical methods are essential in making numerical weather prediction feasible.
* Computing the trajectory of a spacecraft requires the accurate numerical solution of a system of ordinary differential equations.
* Car companies can improve the crash safety of their vehicles by using computer simulations of car crashes. Such simulations essentially consist of solving partial differential equations numerically.
* In the financial field, (private investment funds) and other financial institutions use quantitative finance tools from numerical analysis to attempt to calculate the value of stocks and derivatives more precisely than other market participants.
* Airlines use sophisticated optimization algorithms to decide ticket prices, airplane and crew assignments and fuel needs. Historically, such algorithms were developed within the overlapping field of operations research.
* Insurance companies use numerical programs for actuarial analysis.

==History==
The field of numerical analysis predates the invention of modern computers by many centuries. Linear interpolation was already in use more than 2000 years ago. Many great mathematicians of the past were preoccupied by numerical analysis, as is obvious from the names of important algorithms like Newton&#x27;s method, Lagrange interpolation polynomial, Gaussian elimination, or Euler&#x27;s method. The origins of modern numerical analysis are often linked to a 1947 paper by John von Neumann and Herman Goldstine,
but others consider modern numerical analysis to go back to work by E. T. Whittaker in 1912.
To facilitate computations by hand, large books were produced with formulas and tables of data such as interpolation points and function coefficients. Using these tables, often calculated out to 16 decimal places or more for some functions, one could look up values to plug into the formulas given and achieve very good numerical estimates of some functions. The canonical work in the field is the NIST publication edited by Abramowitz and Stegun, a 1000-plus page book of a very large number of commonly used formulas and functions and their values at many points. The function values are no longer very useful when a computer is available, but the large listing of formulas can still be very handy.

The mechanical calculator was also developed as a tool for hand computation. These calculators evolved into electronic computers in the 1940s, and it was then found that these computers were also useful for administrative purposes. But the invention of the computer also influenced the field of numerical analysis, since now longer and more complicated calculations could be done.

The Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis was initiated in 1985 by the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.

==Key concepts==

===Direct and iterative methods===
Direct methods compute the solution to a problem in a finite number of steps. These methods would give the precise answer if they were performed in infinite precision arithmetic. Examples include Gaussian elimination, the QR factorization method for solving systems of linear equations, and the simplex method of linear programming. In practice, finite precision is used and the result is an approximation of the true solution (assuming stability).

In contrast to direct methods, iterative methods are not expected to terminate in a finite number of steps, even if infinite precision were possible. Starting from an initial guess, iterative methods form successive approximations that converge to the exact solution only in the limit. A convergence test, often involving the residual, is specified in order to decide when a sufficiently accurate solution has (hopefully) been found. Even using infinite precision arithmetic these methods would not reach the solution within a finite number of steps (in general). Examples include Newton&#x27;s method, the bisection method, and Jacobi iteration. In computational matrix algebra, iterative methods are generally needed for large problems.

Iterative methods are more common than direct methods in numerical analysis. Some methods are direct in principle but are usually used as though they were not, e.g. GMRES and the conjugate gradient method. For these methods the number of steps needed to obtain the exact solution is so large that an approximation is accepted in the same manner as for an iterative method.

As an example, consider the problem of solving

:3&quot;x&quot;3 + 4 = 28

for the unknown quantity &quot;x&quot;.

For the iterative method, apply the bisection method to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 3&quot;x&quot;3 − 24. The initial values are &quot;a&quot; = 0, &quot;b&quot; = 3, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = −24, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = 57.

From this table it can be concluded that the solution is between 1.875 and 2.0625. The algorithm might return any number in that range with an error less than 0.2.

===Conditioning===
Ill-conditioned problem: Take the function . Note that &quot;f&quot;(1.1) = 10 and &quot;f&quot;(1.001) = 1000: a change in &quot;x&quot; of less than 0.1 turns into a change in &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of nearly 1000. Evaluating &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) near &quot;x&quot; = 1 is an ill-conditioned problem.

Well-conditioned problem: By contrast, evaluating the same function near &quot;x&quot; = 10 is a well-conditioned problem. For instance, &quot;f&quot;(10) = 1/9 ≈ 0.111 and &quot;f&quot;(11) = 0.1: a modest change in &quot;x&quot; leads to a modest change in &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

===Discretization===
Furthermore, continuous problems must sometimes be replaced by a discrete problem whose solution is known to approximate that of the continuous problem; this process is called &#x27;discretization&#x27;. For example, the solution of a differential equation is a function. This function must be represented by a finite amount of data, for instance by its value at a finite number of points at its domain, even though this domain is a continuum.

==Generation and propagation of errors==

The study of errors forms an important part of numerical analysis. There are several ways in which error can be introduced in the solution of the problem.

===Round-off===
Round-off errors arise because it is impossible to represent all real numbers exactly on a machine with finite memory (which is what all practical digital computers are).

===Truncation and discretization error===
Truncation errors are committed when an iterative method is terminated or a mathematical procedure is approximated and the approximate solution differs from the exact solution. Similarly, discretization induces a discretization error because the solution of the discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem. In the example above to compute the solution of formula_1, after ten iterations, the calculated root is roughly 1.99. Therefore, the truncation error is roughly 0.01.

Once an error is generated, it propagates through the calculation. For example, the operation + on a computer is inexact. A calculation of the type is even more inexact.

A truncation error is created when a mathematical procedure is approximated. To integrate a function exactly, an infinite sum of regions must be found, but numerically only a finite sum of regions can be found, and hence the approximation of the exact solution. Similarly, to differentiate a function, the differential element approaches zero, but numerically only a nonzero value of the differential element can be chosen.

===Numerical stability and well-posed problems===
An algorithm is called &quot;numerically stable&quot; if an error, whatever its cause, does not grow to be much larger during the calculation. This happens if the problem is &quot;well-conditioned&quot;, meaning that the solution changes by only a small amount if the problem data are changed by a small amount. To the contrary, if a problem is &#x27;ill-conditioned&#x27;, then any small error in the data will grow to be a large error.
Both the original problem and the algorithm used to solve that problem can be well-conditioned or ill-conditioned, and any combination is possible.
So an algorithm that solves a well-conditioned problem may be either numerically stable or numerically unstable. An art of numerical analysis is to find a stable algorithm for solving a well-posed mathematical problem.

==Areas of study==
The field of numerical analysis includes many sub-disciplines. Some of the major ones are:

===Computing values of functions===
One of the simplest problems is the evaluation of a function at a given point. The most straightforward approach, of just plugging in the number in the formula is sometimes not very efficient. For polynomials, a better approach is using the Horner scheme, since it reduces the necessary number of multiplications and additions. Generally, it is important to estimate and control round-off errors arising from the use of floating-point arithmetic.

===Interpolation, extrapolation, and regression===
Interpolation solves the following problem: given the value of some unknown function at a number of points, what value does that function have at some other point between the given points?

Extrapolation is very similar to interpolation, except that now the value of the unknown function at a point which is outside the given points must be found.

Regression is also similar, but it takes into account that the data are imprecise. Given some points, and a measurement of the value of some function at these points (with an error), the unknown function can be found. The least squares-method is one way to achieve this.

===Solving equations and systems of equations===
Another fundamental problem is computing the solution of some given equation. Two cases are commonly distinguished, depending on whether the equation is linear or not. For instance, the equation formula_2 is linear while formula_3 is not.

Much effort has been put in the development of methods for solving systems of linear equations. Standard direct methods, i.e., methods that use some matrix decomposition are Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, Cholesky decomposition for symmetric (or hermitian) and positive-definite matrix, and QR decomposition for non-square matrices. Iterative methods such as the Jacobi method, Gauss–Seidel method, successive over-relaxation and conjugate gradient method are usually preferred for large systems. General iterative methods can be developed using a matrix splitting.

Root-finding algorithms are used to solve nonlinear equations (they are so named since a root of a function is an argument for which the function yields zero). If the function is differentiable and the derivative is known, then Newton&#x27;s method is a popular choice. Linearization is another technique for solving nonlinear equations.

===Solving eigenvalue or singular value problems===
Several important problems can be phrased in terms of eigenvalue decompositions or singular value decompositions. For instance, the spectral image compression algorithm is based on the singular value decomposition. The corresponding tool in statistics is called principal component analysis.

===Optimization===
Optimization problems ask for the point at which a given function is maximized (or minimized). Often, the point also has to satisfy some constraints.

The field of optimization is further split in several subfields, depending on the form of the objective function and the constraint. For instance, linear programming deals with the case that both the objective function and the constraints are linear. A famous method in linear programming is the simplex method.

The method of Lagrange multipliers can be used to reduce optimization problems with constraints to unconstrained optimization problems.

===Evaluating integrals===
Numerical integration, in some instances also known as numerical quadrature, asks for the value of a definite integral. Popular methods use one of the Newton–Cotes formulas (like the midpoint rule or Simpson&#x27;s rule) or Gaussian quadrature. These methods rely on a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; strategy, whereby an integral on a relatively large set is broken down into integrals on smaller sets. In higher dimensions, where these methods become prohibitively expensive in terms of computational effort, one may use Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo methods (see Monte Carlo integration), or, in modestly large dimensions, the method of sparse grids.

===Differential equations===
Numerical analysis is also concerned with computing (in an approximate way) the solution of differential equations, both ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations.

Partial differential equations are solved by first discretizing the equation, bringing it into a finite-dimensional subspace. This can be done by a finite element method, a finite difference method, or (particularly in engineering) a finite volume method. The theoretical justification of these methods often involves theorems from functional analysis. This reduces the problem to the solution of an algebraic equation.

==Software==
Since the late twentieth century, most algorithms are implemented in a variety of programming languages. The Netlib repository contains various collections of software routines for numerical problems, mostly in Fortran and C. Commercial products implementing many different numerical algorithms include the IMSL and NAG libraries; a free-software alternative is the GNU Scientific Library.

Over the years the Royal Statistical Society published numerous algorithms in its &quot;Applied Statistics&quot; (code for these &quot;AS&quot; functions is here); 
ACM similarly, in its &quot;Transactions on Mathematical Software&quot; (&quot;TOMS&quot; code is here).
The Naval Surface Warfare Center several times published its &quot;Library of Mathematics Subroutines&quot; (code here).

There are several popular numerical computing applications such as MATLAB, TK Solver, S-PLUS, and IDL as well as free and open-source alternatives such as FreeMat, Scilab, GNU Octave (similar to Matlab), and IT++ (a C++ library). There are also programming languages such as R (similar to S-PLUS), Julia, and Python with libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and SymPy. Performance varies widely: while vector and matrix operations are usually fast, scalar loops may vary in speed by more than an order of magnitude.

Many computer algebra systems such as Mathematica also benefit from the availability of arbitrary-precision arithmetic which can provide more accurate results.

Also, any spreadsheet software can be used to solve simple problems relating to numerical analysis. 
Excel, for example, has hundreds of available functions, including for matrices, which may be used in conjunction with its built in &quot;solver&quot;.

<text>The noosphere (alternate spelling noösphere) is a philosophical concept developed and popularized by the biogeochemist Vladimir Vernadsky and philosopher and Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Vernadsky defined the noosphere as the new state of the biosphere, and described it as the planetary &quot;sphere of reason&quot;. The noosphere represents the highest stage of biospheric development, that of humankind&#x27;s rational activities.

The word is derived from the Greek (&quot;nous, mind, reason&quot;) and (&quot;sphere&quot;), in lexical analogy to &quot;atmosphere&quot; and &quot;biosphere&quot;. The concept cannot be accredited to a single author. The founding authors Vernadsky and de Chardin developed two related but starkly different concepts, the former grounded in the geological sciences, and the latter in theology. Both conceptions of the noosphere share the common thesis that together human reason and scientific thought have created, and will continue to create, the next evolutionary geological layer. This geological layer is part of the evolutionary chain. Second-generation authors, predominantly of Russian origin, have further developed the Vernadskian concept, creating the related concepts: noocenosis and noocenology.

==Concept==

In the theory of Vernadsky, the noosphere is the third in a succession of phases of development of the Earth, after the geosphere (inanimate matter) and the biosphere (biological life). Just as the emergence of life fundamentally transformed the geosphere, the emergence of human cognition fundamentally transforms the biosphere. In contrast to the conceptions of the Gaia theorists, or the promoters of cyberspace, Vernadsky&#x27;s noosphere emerges at the point where humankind, through the mastery of nuclear processes, begins to create resources through the transmutation of elements. It is a study area of the Global Consciousness Project.

For de Chardin, the noosphere emerges through and is constituted by the interaction of human minds. The noosphere has grown in step with the organization of the human mass in relation to itself as it populates the Earth. As mankind organizes itself in more complex social networks, the higher the noosphere will grow in awareness. This concept extends Teilhard&#x27;s Law of Complexity/Consciousness, the law describing the nature of evolution in the universe. Teilhard argued the noosphere is growing towards an even greater integration and unification, culminating in the Omega Point - an apex of thought/consciousness - which he saw as the goal of history.
==Founding authors==
The term noosphere was first used in the publications of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in 1922 in his &quot;Cosmogenesis&quot;. Vernadsky was most likely introduced to the term by a common acquaintance, Édouard Le Roy, during a stay in Paris. Some sources claim Édouard Le Roy actually first proposed the term. Vernadsky himself wrote that he was first introduced to the concept by Le Roy in his 1927 lectures at the College of France, and that Le Roy had emphasized a mutual exploration of the concept with Teilhard de Chardin. According to Vernadsky&#x27;s own letters, he took Le Roy&#x27;s ideas on the noosphere from Le Roy&#x27;s article &quot;Les origines humaines et l’evolution de l’intelligence&quot;, part III: &quot;La noosphere et l’hominisation&quot;, before reworking the concept within his own field, biogeochemistry. The historian Bailes concludes that Vernadsky and Teilhard de Chardin were mutual influences on each other, as Teilhard de Chardin also attended Vernadsky&#x27;s lectures on biogeochemistry, before creating the concept of the noosphere.

An account stated that Le Roy and Teilhard were not aware of the concept of biosphere in their noosphere concept and that it was Vernadsky who introduced them to this notion, which gave their conceptualization a grounding on natural sciences. Both Teilhard de Chardin and Vernadsky base their conceptions of the noosphere on the term &#x27;biosphere&#x27;, developed by Edward Suess in 1875. Despite the differing backgrounds, approaches and focuses of Teilhard and Vernadsky, they have a few fundamental themes in common. Both scientists overstepped the boundaries of the natural sciences and attempted to create all-embracing theoretical constructions founded in philosophy, the social sciences and authorized interpretations of the evolutionary theory. Moreover, both thinkers were convinced of the teleological character of evolution. They also argued that human activity becomes a geological power and that the manner by which it is directed can influence the environment. There are fundamental differences in the two conceptions.

<text>Niccolò (or Nicolò) Paganini (; ; 27 October 178227 May 1840) was an Italian violinist and composer. He was the most celebrated violin virtuoso of his time, and left his mark as one of the pillars of modern violin technique. His 24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1 are among the best known of his compositions and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers.

Son of a ship chandler from Genoa, Paganini showed great gifts for music from an early age and studied under Alessandro Rolla, Ferdinando Paer and Gasparo Ghiretti. Accompanied by his father, he toured northern Italy extensively as a teenager. By 1805 he had come into the service of Napoleon&#x27;s sister, Elisa Bonaparte, who then ruled Lucca where Paganini was first violin. From 1809 on he returned to touring and achieved continental fame in the subsequent two and a half decades, developing a reputation for his technical brilliance and showmanship, as well as his extravagant, philandering lifestyle. Paganini ended his concert career in 1834 amid declining health, and the failure of his Paris casino left him in financial ruin. He retired to southern France and died in Nice in 1840 at the age of 57.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Niccolò Paganini was born in Genoa (then capital of the Republic of Genoa) on 27 October 1782, the third of the six children of Antonio and Teresa (née Bocciardo) Paganini. Antonio Paganini was an unsuccessful ship chandler, but he managed to supplement his income by working as a musician and by selling mandolins. At the age of five, Paganini started learning the mandolin from his father and moved to the violin by the age of seven. His musical talents were quickly recognized, earning him numerous scholarships for violin lessons. The young Paganini studied under various local violinists, including Giovanni Servetto and Giacomo Costa, but his progress quickly outpaced their abilities. Paganini and his father then traveled to Parma to seek further guidance from Alessandro Rolla. But upon listening to Paganini&#x27;s playing, Rolla immediately referred him to his own teacher, Ferdinando Paer and, later, Paer&#x27;s own teacher, Gasparo Ghiretti. 

=== Early career ===
The French invaded northern Italy in March 1796, and the political situation in Genoa became unstable. The Paganinis sought refuge in their country property in Romairone, near Bolzaneto. It was in this period that Paganini is thought to have developed his relationship with the guitar. He mastered the guitar, but preferred to play it in exclusively intimate, rather than public concerts. He later described the guitar as his &quot;constant companion&quot; on his concert tours. By 1800, Paganini and his father traveled to Livorno, where Paganini played in concerts and his father resumed his maritime work. In 1801, the 18-year-old Paganini was appointed first violin of the Republic of Lucca, but a substantial portion of his income came from freelancing. His fame as a violinist was matched only by his reputation as a gambler and philanderer.

In 1805, Lucca was annexed by Napoleonic France, and the region was ceded to Napoleon&#x27;s sister, Elisa Bonaparte. Paganini became a violinist for the Baciocchi court, while giving private lessons to Elisa&#x27;s husband, Felice for ten years. During this time, his wife and Paganini were also carrying on a romantic affair. In 1807, Baciocchi became the Grand Duchess of Tuscany and her court was transferred to Florence. Paganini was part of the entourage but, towards the end of 1809, he left Baciocchi to resume his freelance career.

=== Travelling virtuoso ===

For the next few years, Paganini returned to touring in the areas surrounding Parma and Genoa. Though he was very popular with the local audience, he was still not very well known in the rest of Europe. His first break came from an 1813 concert at La Scala in Milan. The concert was a great success. As a result, Paganini began to attract the attention of other prominent, though more conservative, musicians across Europe. His early encounters with Charles Philippe Lafont and Louis Spohr created intense rivalry.

In 1827, Pope Leo XII honoured Paganini with the Order of the Golden Spur. His fame spread across Europe with a concert tour that started in Vienna in August 1828, stopping in every major European city in Germany, Poland, and Bohemia until February 1831 in Strasbourg. This was followed by tours in Paris and Britain. His technical ability and his willingness to display it received much critical acclaim. In addition to his own compositions, theme and variations being the most popular, Paganini also performed modified versions of works (primarily concertos) written by his early contemporaries, such as Rodolphe Kreutzer and Giovanni Battista Viotti.

Paganini&#x27;s travels also brought him into contact with eminent guitar virtuosi of the day, including Ferdinando Carulli in Paris and Mauro Giuliani in Vienna.

===Late career and health decline===
Throughout his life, Paganini was no stranger to chronic illnesses. Although no definite medical proof exists, it has been later theorized that he might have been affected by Marfan syndrome or Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. His frequent concert schedule, as well as his extravagant lifestyle, may have affected his health. Paganini was diagnosed with syphilis as early as 1822, and his remedy, which included mercury and opium, came with serious physical and psychological side effects. In 1834, while still in Paris, he was treated for tuberculosis.

In September 1834, Paganini put an end to his concert career and returned to Genoa. Contrary to popular beliefs involving his wishing to keep his music and techniques secret, Paganini devoted his time to the publication of his compositions and violin methods. He accepted students, of whom two enjoyed moderate success: violinist Camillo Sivori and cellist Gaetano Ciandelli. Neither, however, considered Paganini helpful or inspirational. In 1835, Paganini returned to Parma, this time under the employ of Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria, Napoleon&#x27;s second wife. He was in charge of reorganizing her court orchestra, but he eventually conflicted with the players and court, so his visions never saw completion. In Paris, he befriended the 11-year-old Polish virtuoso Apollinaire de Kontski, giving him some lessons and a signed testimonial. It was widely put about, falsely, that Paganini was so impressed with de Kontski&#x27;s skills that he bequeathed him his violins and manuscripts.

===Final years, death, and burial===

In 1836, Paganini returned to Paris to set up a casino. Its immediate failure left him in financial ruin, and he auctioned off his personal effects, including his musical instruments, to recoup his losses. At Christmas of 1838, he left Paris for Marseille and, after a brief stay, traveled to Nice where his condition worsened. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the last rites. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused.

A week later, on 27 May 1840, the 57-year-old Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa. It took four years and an appeal to the Pope before the Church let his body be transported to Genoa, but it was still not buried. His body was finally buried in 1876, in a cemetery in Parma. In 1893, the Czech violinist František Ondříček persuaded Paganini&#x27;s grandson, Attila, to allow a viewing of the violinist&#x27;s body. After this episode, Paganini&#x27;s body was finally reinterred in a new cemetery in Parma in 1896.

==Personal life==

Though having no shortage of romantic conquests, Paganini was seriously involved with a singer named Antonia Bianchi from Como, whom he met in Milan in 1813. The two gave concerts together throughout Italy. They had a son, Achille Ciro Alessandro, born on 23 July 1825 in Palermo and baptized at San Bartolomeo&#x27;s. They never legalized their union and it ended around April 1828 in Vienna. Paganini brought Achille on his European tours, and Achille later accompanied his father until the latter&#x27;s death.

Throughout his career, Paganini also became close friends with composers Gioachino Rossini and Hector Berlioz. Rossini and Paganini met in Bologna in the summer of 1818. In January 1821, on his return from Naples, Paganini met Rossini again in Rome, just in time to become the substitute conductor for Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;Matilde di Shabran&quot;, upon the sudden death of the original conductor. Paganini&#x27;s efforts earned great gratitude from Rossini.

Paganini met Berlioz in Paris in 1833 and they continued to correspond. He commissioned a piece from the composer, but was not satisfied with the resultant four-movement piece for orchestra and viola obbligato, &quot;Harold en Italie&quot;. He never performed it; instead, it was premiered a year later by violist Christian Urhan. He did, however, write his own &quot;Sonata per Gran Viola&quot; Op. 35 (with orchestra or guitar accompaniment). Despite his alleged lack of interest in &quot;Harold&quot;, Paganini often referred to Berlioz as the resurrection of Beethoven and, towards the end of his life, he gave large sums to the composer. They shared an active interest in the guitar, which they both played and used in compositions. Paganini gave Berlioz a guitar, which they both signed on its sound box.

==Playing style==
===Instruments===

Paganini was in possession of a number of fine stringed instruments, including 11 Stradivari at the time of his death. More legendary than these were the circumstances under which he obtained (and lost) some of them. While Paganini was still a teenager in Livorno, a wealthy businessman named Livron lent him a violin, made by the master luthier Giuseppe Guarneri, for a concert. Livron was so impressed with Paganini&#x27;s playing that he refused to take it back. This particular violin came to be known as &quot;Il Cannone Guarnerius&quot; (&quot;The Cannon of Guarnieri&quot;) because of its powerful voice and resonance.
Other instruments associated with Paganini include the &quot;Antonio Amati&quot; 1600, the &quot;Nicolò Amati&quot; 1657, the &quot;Paganini-Desaint&quot; 1680 Stradivari, the Guarneri-filius &quot;Andrea&quot; 1706, the &quot;Le Brun&quot; 1712 Stradivari, the &quot;Vuillaume&quot; c. 1720 Bergonzi, the &quot;Hubay&quot; 1726 Stradivari, and the &quot;Comte Cozio di Salabue&quot; 1727 violins; the &quot;Countess of Flanders&quot; 1582 da Salò-di Bertolotti, and the &quot;Mendelssohn&quot; 1731 Stradivari violas; the &quot;Piatti&quot; 1700 Goffriller, the &quot;Stanlein&quot; 1707 Stradivari, and the &quot;Ladenburg&quot; 1736 Stradivari cellos; and the &quot;Grobert of Mirecourt&quot; 1820 (guitar).

Of his guitars, there is little evidence remaining of his various choices of instrument. The aforementioned guitar that he gave to Berlioz is a French instrument made by one Grobert of Mirecourt. The luthier made his instrument in the style of René Lacôte, a more well-known Paris-based guitar-maker. It is preserved and on display in the Musée de la Musique in Paris.

Of the guitars he owned through his life, there was an instrument by Gennaro Fabricatore that he had refused to sell even in his periods of financial stress, and was among the instruments in his possession at the time of his death.

===Violin technique===

The Israeli violinist Ivry Gitlis once referred to Paganini as a phenomenon rather than a development. Though some of the techniques frequently employed by Paganini were already present, most accomplished violinists of the time focused on intonation and bowing techniques. Arcangelo Corelli (1653–1713) was considered a pioneer in transforming the violin from an ensemble instrument to a solo instrument. Other notable violinists included Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741) and Giuseppe Tartini (1692–1770), who, in their compositions, reflected the increasing technical and musical demands on the violinist. Although the role of the violin in music drastically changed through this period, progress in violin technique was steady but slow.

Much of Paganini&#x27;s playing (and his violin composition) was influenced by two violinists, Pietro Locatelli (1693–1746) and August Duranowski (Auguste Frédéric Durand) (1770–1834). During Paganini&#x27;s study in Parma, he came across the 24 Caprices of Locatelli (entitled &quot;L&#x27;arte di nuova modulazione – Capricci enigmatici&quot; or &quot;The art of the new style – the enigmatic caprices&quot;). Published in the 1730s, they were shunned by the musical authorities for their technical innovations, and were forgotten by the musical community at large. Around the same time, Durand, a former student of Giovanni Battista Viotti (1755–1824), became a celebrated violinist. He was renowned for his use of harmonics, both natural and artificial (which had previously not been attempted in performance), and the left hand pizzicato in his performance. Paganini was impressed by Durand&#x27;s innovations and showmanship, which later also became the hallmarks of the young violin virtuoso. Paganini was instrumental in the revival and popularization of these violinistic techniques.

Another aspect of Paganini&#x27;s violin techniques concerned his flexibility. He had exceptionally long fingers and was capable of playing three octaves across four strings in a hand span, an extraordinary feat even by today&#x27;s standards.

==Compositions==

Paganini composed his own works to play exclusively in his concerts, all of which profoundly influenced the evolution of violin technique. His 24 Caprices were likely composed between 1805 and 1809, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court. Also during this period, he composed the majority of the solo pieces, duo-sonatas, trios, and quartets for the guitar, either as a solo instrument or with strings. These chamber works may have been inspired by the publication, in Lucca, of the guitar quintets of Boccherini. Many of his variations, including &quot;Le Streghe&quot;, &quot;The Carnival of Venice&quot;, and &quot;Nel cor più non-mi sento&quot;, were composed, or at least first performed, before his European concert tour. His six violin concertos were written between 1817 and 1830.

Generally speaking, Paganini&#x27;s compositions were technically imaginative, and the timbre of the instrument was greatly expanded as a result of these works. Sounds of different musical instruments and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled &quot;Il Fandango Spanolo&quot; (The Spanish Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was a solo piece &quot;Duetto Amoroso&quot;, in which the sighs and groans of lovers were intimately depicted on the violin. There survives a manuscript of the &quot;Duetto&quot;, which has been recorded. The existence of the &quot;Fandango&quot; is known only through concert posters.Eugène Ysaÿe criticized Paganini&#x27;s works for lacking characteristics of true polyphonism. Yehudi Menuhin, on the other hand, suggested that this might have been the result of Paganini&#x27;s reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition. The orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of the soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as Giovanni Paisiello, Gioachino Rossini, and Gaetano Donizetti, who were influenced by the guitar-song milieu of Naples during this period.

Paganini&#x27;s &quot;La Campanella&quot; and the A minor Caprice (No. 24) have inspired many composers, including Franz Liszt, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Boris Blacher, Andrew Lloyd Webber, George Rochberg, and Witold Lutosławski, all of whom wrote variations on these works.

===Memorials and other tributes===

In 1904 the Genoa Conservatory was renamed the &quot;Conservatorio Niccolò Paganini&quot; in honor of the composer. The conservatory is also host to the Paganini Competition (&quot;Premio Paganini&quot;); an international violin competition created in 1954.

In 1972 the State of Italy purchased a large collection of Niccolò Paganini manuscripts from the W. Heyer Library of Cologne. They are housed at the Biblioteca Casanatense in Rome.

In 1982 the city of Genoa commissioned a thematic catalogue of music by Paganini, edited by Maria Rosa Moretti and Anna Sorrento, hence the abbreviation &quot;MS&quot; assigned to his catalogued works.

A minor planet 2859 Paganini discovered in 1978 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Chernykh is named after him.

=== Fiorini daguerreotype ===
Although no photographs of Paganini are known to exist, in 1900 Italian violin maker Giuseppe Fiorini forged the now famous fake daguerreotype of the celebrated violinist. So well in fact, that even the great classical author and conversationalist Arthur M. Abell was led to believe it to be true, reprinting the image in the 22 January 1901 issue of the &quot;Musical Courier&quot;.

===Dramatic portrayals===

Paganini has been portrayed by a number of actors in film and television productions, including Stewart Granger in the 1946 biographical portrait &quot;The Magic Bow&quot;, Roxy Roth in &quot;A Song to Remember&quot; (1945), Klaus Kinski in &quot;Kinski Paganini&quot; (1989), and David Garrett in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Violinist&quot; (2013).

In the Soviet 1982 miniseries &quot;Niccolo Paganini&quot;, the musician was portrayed by the Armenian actor Vladimir Msryan. The series focuses on Paganini&#x27;s relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor, Armen Dzhigarkhanyan, played Paganini&#x27;s fictionalized arch-rival, an insidious Jesuit official. The information in the series is generally spurious, and it also plays to some of the myths and legends rampant during the musician&#x27;s lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini&#x27;s adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity. He did this by carefully filing notches into them to weaken them, so that they would break when in use.

In Don Nigro&#x27;s satirical comedy play &quot;Paganini&quot; (1995), the great violinist seeks vainly for his salvation, claiming that he unknowingly sold his soul to the Devil. &quot;Variation upon variation,&quot; he cries at one point, &quot;but which variation leads to salvation and which to damnation? Music is a question for which there is no answer.&quot; Paganini is portrayed as having killed three of his lovers and sinking repeatedly into poverty, prison, and drink. Each time he is &quot;rescued&quot; by the Devil, who appears in different guises, returning Paganini&#x27;s violin so he can continue playing. In the end, Paganini&#x27;s salvation—administered by a god-like Clockmaker—turns out to be imprisonment in a large bottle where he plays his music for the amusement of the public through all eternity. &quot;Do not pity him, my dear,&quot; the Clockmaker tells Antonia, one of Paganini&#x27;s murdered wives. &quot;He is alone with the answer for which there is no question. The saved and the damned are the same.&quot;

The musical &quot;Cross Road&quot;, premiered 2022 and revived 2024, features Niccolo Paganini as a main character, played by Hiroki Aiba (2022 and 2024), Kenta Mizue (2022), and Kento Kinouchi (2024). The story is about his making a contract with the Devil of Music, Amduscias, played by Akinori Nakagawa in both productions. The musical is by Bun-O Fujisawa, composed by Toshiyuki Muranaka. It was performed at Theater Creation in Tokyo, Japan, with a national tour in 2024.

Another musical about Paganini has been produced in South Korea, called &quot;Paganini&quot;. It focuses on his son, Achille.

<text>The North Atlantic Current (NAC), also known as North Atlantic Drift and North Atlantic Sea Movement, is a powerful warm western boundary current within the Atlantic Ocean that extends the Gulf Stream northeastward.

== Characteristics ==

The NAC originates from where the Gulf Stream turns north at the Southeast Newfoundland Rise, a submarine ridge that stretches southeast from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The NAC flows northward east of the Grand Banks, from 40°N to 51°N, before turning sharply east to cross the Atlantic. It transports more warm tropical water to northern latitudes than any other boundary current; more than 40 Sv () in the south and 20 Sv () as it crosses the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It reaches speeds of near the North American coast. Directed by topography, the NAC meanders heavily, but in contrast to the meanders of the Gulf Stream, the NAC meanders remain stable without breaking off into eddies.

The colder parts of the Gulf Stream turn northward near the &quot;tail&quot; of the Grand Banks at 50°W where the Azores Current branches off to flow south of the Azores. From there the NAC flows northeastward, east of the Flemish Cap (47°N, 45°W). Approaching the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, it then turns eastward and becomes much broader and more diffuse. It then splits into a colder northeastern branch and a warmer eastern branch. As the warmer branch turns southward, most of the subtropical component of the Gulf Stream is diverted southward, and as a consequence, the North Atlantic is mostly supplied by subpolar waters, including a contribution from the Labrador Current recirculated into the NAC at 45°N.

West of Continental Europe, it splits into two major branches. One branch goes southeast, becoming the Canary Current as it passes northwest Africa and turns southwest. The other major branch continues north along the coast of Northwestern Europe.
Other branches include the Irminger Current and the Norwegian Current. Driven by the global thermohaline circulation, the North Atlantic Current is part of the wind-driven Gulf Stream, which goes further east and north from the North American coast across the Atlantic and into the Arctic Ocean.

The North Atlantic Current, together with the Gulf Stream, have a long-lived reputation for having a considerable warming influence on European climate. However, the principal cause for differences in winter climate between North America and Europe seems to be winds rather than ocean currents (although the currents do exert influence at very high latitudes by preventing the formation of sea ice).

== Climate change ==
Unlike the AMOC, the observations of Labrador Sea outflow showed no negative trend from 1997 to 2009, and the Labrador Sea convection began to intensify in 2012, reaching a new high in 2016. As of 2022, the trend of strengthened Labrador Sea convection appears to hold, and is associated with observed increases in marine primary production. Yet, a 150-year dataset suggests that even this recently strengthened convection is anomalously weak compared to its baseline state.

Some climate models indicate that the deep convection in Labrador-Irminger Seas could collapse under certain global warming scenarios, which would then collapse the entire circulation in the North subpolar gyre. It is considered unlikely to recover even if the temperature is returned to a lower level, making it an example of a climate tipping point. This would result in rapid cooling, with implications for economic sectors, agriculture industry, water resources and energy management in Western Europe and the East Coast of the United States. Frajka-Williams et al. 2017 pointed out that recent changes in cooling of the subpolar gyre, warm temperatures in the subtropics and cool anomalies over the tropics, increased the spatial distribution of meridional gradient in sea surface temperatures, which is not captured by the AMO Index.

A 2021 study found that this collapse occurs in only four CMIP6 models out of 35 analyzed. However, only 11 models out of 35 can simulate North Atlantic Current with a high degree of accuracy, and this includes all four models which simulate collapse of the subpolar gyre. As the result, the study estimated the risk of an abrupt cooling event over Europe caused by the collapse of the current at 36.4%, which is lower than the 45.5% chance estimated by the previous generation of models In 2022, a paper suggested that previous disruption of subpolar gyre was connected to the Little Ice Age.

A 2022 Science Magazine review study on climate tipping points noted that in the scenarios where this convection collapses, it is most likely to be triggered by 1.8 degrees of global warming. However, model differences mean that the required warming may be as low as 1.1 degrees or as high as 3.8 degrees. Once triggered, the collapse of the current would most likely take 10 years from start to end, with a range between 5 and 50 years. The loss of this convection is estimated to lower the global temperature by up to 0.5 degrees, while the average temperature in certain regions of the North Atlantic decreases by around 3 degrees. There are also substantial impacts on regional precipitation.
A 2023 study warns that the collapse could already happen by mid century.

<text>North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is a deep water mass formed in the North Atlantic Ocean. Thermohaline circulation (properly described as meridional overturning circulation) of the world&#x27;s oceans involves the flow of warm surface waters from the southern hemisphere into the North Atlantic. Water flowing northward becomes modified through evaporation and mixing with other water masses, leading to increased salinity. When this water reaches the North Atlantic, it cools and sinks through convection, due to its decreased temperature and increased salinity resulting in increased density. NADW is the outflow of this thick deep layer, which can be detected by its high salinity, high oxygen content, nutrient minima, high 14C/12C, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

CFCs are anthropogenic substances that enter the surface of the ocean from gas exchange with the atmosphere. This distinct composition allows its path to be traced as it mixes with Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which in turn fills the deep Indian Ocean and part of the South Pacific. NADW and its formation is essential to the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which is responsible for transporting large amounts of water, heat, salt, carbon, nutrients and other substances from the Tropical Atlantic to the Mid and High Latitude Atlantic. 

In the conveyor belt model of thermohaline circulation of the world&#x27;s oceans, the sinking of NADW pulls the waters of the North Atlantic drift northward. However, this is almost certainly an oversimplification of the actual relationship between NADW formation and the strength of the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic drift.

NADW has a temperature of 2.0-3.5 °C with a practical salinity of &quot;S&quot;P = 34.9-35.0, found at a depth between 1500 and 4000m.

==Formation and sources==
The NADW is a complex of several water masses formed by deep convection and overflow of dense water across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge.

The upper layers are formed by deep open ocean convection during winter. Labrador Sea Water (LSW), formed in the Labrador Sea, can reach depths of 2000 m as dense water sinks downward. Classical Labrador Sea Water (CLSW) production is dependent on preconditioning of water in the Labrador Sea from the previous year and the strength of the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO).

During a positive NAO phase, conditions exist for strong winter storms to develop. These storms freshen the surface water, and their winds increase cyclonic flow, which allows denser waters to sink. As a result, the temperature, salinity, and density vary yearly. In some years these conditions do not exist and CLSW is not formed. CLSW has characteristic potential temperature of 3 °C, salinity of 34.88 psu, and density of 34.66.

Another component of LSW is the Upper Labrador Sea Water (ULSW). ULSW forms at a density lower than CLSW and has a CFC maximum between 1200 and 1500 m in the subtropical North Atlantic. Eddies of cold less saline ULSW have similar densities of warmer saltier water and flow along the DWBC, but maintain their high CFCs. The ULSW eddies erode rapidly as they mix laterally with this warmer saltier water.

The lower waters mass of NADW form from overflow of the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge. They are Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) and Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW). The overflows are a combination of dense Arctic Ocean water (18%), modified Atlantic water (32%), and intermediate water from the Nordic seas (20%), that entrain and mix with other water masses (contributing 30%) as they flow over the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge.

The formation of both of these waters involves the conversion of warm, salty, northward-flowing surface waters to cold, dense, deep waters behind the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge. Water flow from the North Atlantic current enters the Arctic Ocean through the Norwegian Current, which splits into the Fram Strait and Barents Sea Branch. Water from the Fram Strait recirculates, reaching a density of DSOW, sinks, and flows towards the Denmark Strait. Water flowing into the Barents Sea feeds ISOW.

ISOW enters the eastern North Atlantic over the Iceland-Scotland Ridge through the Faeroe Bank Channel at a depth of 850 m, with some water flowing over the shallower Iceland-Faeroe Rise. ISOW has a low CFC concentrations and it has been estimated from these concentrations that ISOW resides behind the ridge for 45 years. As the water flows southward at the bottom of the channel, it entrains surrounding water of the eastern North Atlantic, and flows to the western North Atlantic through the Charlie–Gibbs fracture zone, entraining with LSW. This water is less dense than DSOW and lays above it as it flows cyclonically in the Irminger Basin.

DSOW is the coldest, densest, and freshest water mass of NADW. DSOW formed behind the ridge flows over the Denmark Strait at a depth of 600m. The most significant water mass contributing to DSOW is Arctic Intermediate Water (AIW). Winter cooling and convection allow AIW to sink and pool behind the Denmark Strait. Upper AIW has a high amount of anthropogenic tracers due its exposure to the atmosphere. AIW&#x27;s tritium and CFC signature is observed in DSOW at the base of the Greenland continental slope. This also showed that the DSOW flowing 450 km to the south was no older than 2 years. Both the DSOW and ISOW flow around the Irminger Basin and Labrador Sea in a deep boundary current. Leaving the Greenland Sea with 2.5 Sv, its flow increases to 10 Sv south of Greenland. It is cold and relatively fresh, flowing below 3500 m in the DWBC and spreading inward the deep Atlantic basins.

==Spreading pathways==

The southward spread of NADW along the Deep Western Boundary current (DWBC) can be traced by its high oxygen content, high CFCs, and density.

ULSW is the major source of upper NADW. ULSW advects southward from the Labrador Sea in small eddies that mix into the DWBC. A CFC maximum associated with ULSW has been observed along 24°N in the DWBC at 1500 m. Some of the upper ULSW recirculates into the Gulf Stream, while some remains in the DWBC. High CFCs in the subtropics indicate recirculation in the subtropics.

ULSW that remains in the DWBC dilutes as it moves equatorward. Deep convection in the Labrador Sea during the late 1980s and early 1990s resulted in CLSW with a lower CFC concentration due to downward mixing. Convection allowed the CFCs to penetrate further downward to 2000m. These minima could be tracked, and were first observed in the subtropics in the early 1990s.

ISOW and DSOW flow around the Irminger Basin and DSOW entering the DWBC. These are the two lower portions of the NADW. Another CFC maximum is seen at 3500 m in the subtropics from the DSOW contribution to NADW. Some of the NADW recirculates with the northern gyre. To the south of the gyre, NADW flows under the Gulf Stream, where it continues along the DWBC until it reaches another gyre in the subtropics.

Lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW), originating in the Greenland and Norwegian seas, brings high salinity, oxygen, and freon concentrations towards to the Romanche Trench, an equatorial fracture zone in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Found at depths around , LNADW flow east through the trench over Antarctic Bottom Water—the trench is the only opening in the MAR where inter-basin exchange is possible for these two water masses.

==Variability==
It is believed that North Atlantic Deep Water formation has been dramatically reduced at times during the past (such as during the Younger Dryas or during Heinrich events), and that this might correlate with a decrease in the strength of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic drift, in turn cooling the climate of northwestern Europe.

There is concern that global warming might cause this to happen again. It is also hypothesized that during the Last Glacial Maximum, NADW was replaced with an analogous watermass that occupied a shallower depth known as Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water.

<text>Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology. Nanomedicine ranges from the medical applications of nanomaterials and biological devices, to nanoelectronic biosensors, and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology such as biological machines. Current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials (materials whose structure is on the scale of nanometers, i.e. billionths of a meter).

Functionalities can be added to nanomaterials by interfacing them with biological molecules or structures. The size of nanomaterials is similar to that of most biological molecules and structures; therefore, nanomaterials can be useful for both in vivo and in vitro biomedical research and applications. Thus far, the integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the development of diagnostic devices, contrast agents, analytical tools, physical therapy applications, and drug delivery vehicles.

Nanomedicine seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically useful devices in the near future. The National Nanotechnology Initiative expects new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems, new therapies, and in vivo imaging. Nanomedicine research is receiving funding from the US National Institutes of Health Common Fund program, supporting four nanomedicine development centers. The goal of funding this newer form of science is to further develop the biological, biochemical, and biophysical mechanisms of living tissues. More medical and drug companies today are becoming involved in nanomedical research and medications. These include Bristol-Myers Squibb, which focuses on drug delivery systems for immunology and fibrotic diseases; Moderna known for their COVID-19 vaccine and their work on mRNA therapeutics; and Nanobiotix, a company that focuses on cancer and currently has a drug in testing that increases the effect of radiation on targeted cells. More companies include Generation Bio, which specializes in genetic medicines and has developed the cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle, and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, which developed Vyxeos , a drug that treats acute myeloid leukemia, and concentrates on cancer and neuroscience. Cytiva is a company that specializes in producing delivery systems for genomic medicines that are non-viral, including mRNA vaccines and other therapies utilizing nucleic acid and Ratiopharm is known for manufacturing Pazenir, a drug for various cancers. Finally, Pacira specializes in pain management and is know for producing ZILRETTA for osteoarthritis knee pain, the first treatment without opioids. 

Nanomedicine sales reached $16 billion in 2015, with a minimum of $3.8 billion in nanotechnology R&amp;D being invested every year. Global funding for emerging nanotechnology increased by 45% per year in recent years, with product sales exceeding $1 trillion in 2013. In 2023, the global market was valued at $189.55 billion and is predicted to exceed $ 500 billion in the next ten years. As the nanomedicine industry continues to grow, it is expected to have a significant impact on the economy.

==Drug delivery==

 Nanotechnology has provided the possibility of delivering drugs to specific cells using nanoparticles. This use of drug delivery systems was first proposed by Gregory Gregoriadis in 1974, who outlined liposomes as a drug delivery system for chemotherapy. The overall drug consumption and side-effects may be lowered significantly by depositing the active pharmaceutical agent in the diseased region only and in no higher dose than needed. Targeted drug delivery is intended to reduce the side effects of drugs in tandem decreases in consumption and treatment expenses. Additionally, targeted drug delivery reduces the side effects of crude or naturally occurring drugs by minimizing undesired exposure to healthy cells. Drug delivery focuses on maximizing bioavailability both at specific places in the body and over a period of time. This can potentially be achieved by molecular targeting by nanoengineered devices. A benefit of using nanoscale for medical technologies is that smaller devices are less invasive and can possibly be implanted inside the body, plus biochemical reaction times are much shorter. These devices are faster and more sensitive than typical drug delivery. The efficacy of drug delivery through nanomedicine is largely based upon: a) efficient encapsulation of the drugs, b) successful delivery of drug to the targeted region of the body, and c) successful release of the drug. Several nano-delivery drugs were on the market by 2019.

Drug delivery systems, lipid- or polymer-based nanoparticles, can be designed to improve the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the drug. However, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanomedicine is highly variable among different patients. When designed to avoid the body&#x27;s defense mechanisms, nanoparticles have beneficial properties that can be used to improve drug delivery. Complex drug delivery mechanisms are being developed, including the ability to get drugs through cell membranes and into cell cytoplasm. Triggered response is one way for drug molecules to be used more efficiently. Drugs are placed in the body and only activate on encountering a particular signal. For example, a drug with poor solubility will be replaced by a drug delivery system where both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments exist, improving the solubility. Drug delivery systems may also be able to prevent tissue damage through regulated drug release; reduce drug clearance rates; or lower the volume of distribution and reduce the effect on non-target tissue. However, the biodistribution of these nanoparticles is still imperfect due to the complex host&#x27;s reactions to nano- and microsized materials and the difficulty in targeting specific organs in the body. Nevertheless, a lot of work is still ongoing to optimize and better understand the potential and limitations of nanoparticulate systems. While advancement of research proves that targeting and distribution can be augmented by nanoparticles, the dangers of nanotoxicity become an important next step in further understanding of their medical uses. The toxicity of nanoparticles varies, depending on size, shape, and material. These factors also affect the build-up and organ damage that may occur. Nanoparticles are made to be long-lasting, but this causes them to be trapped within organs, specifically the liver and spleen, as they cannot be broken down or excreted. This build-up of non-biodegradable material has been observed to cause organ damage and inflammation in mice. Delivering magnetic nanoparticles to a tumor using uneven stationary magnetic fields may lead to enhanced tumor growth. In order to avoid this, alternating electromagnetic fields should be used.

Nanoparticles are under research for their potential to decrease antibiotic resistance or for various antimicrobial uses. Nanoparticles might also be used to circumvent multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms.

=== Systems under research ===
Advances in lipid nanotechnology were instrumental in engineering medical nanodevices and novel drug delivery systems, as well as in developing sensing applications. Another system for microRNA delivery under preliminary research is nanoparticles formed by the self-assembly of two different microRNAs to possibly shrink tumors. One potential application is based on small electromechanical systems, such as nanoelectromechanical systems being investigated for the active release of drugs and sensors for possible cancer treatment with iron nanoparticles or gold shells. Another system of drug delivery involving nanoparticles is the use of aquasomes, self-assembled nanoparticles with a nanocrystalline center, a coating made of a polyhydroxyl oligomer, covered in the desired drug, which protects it from dehydration and conformational change.

== Applications ==
Some nanotechnology-based drugs that are commercially available or in human clinical trials include:
*Doxil was originally approved by the FDA for the use on HIV-related Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma. It is now being used to also treat ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma. The drug is encased in liposomes, which helps to extend the life of the drug that is being distributed. Liposomes are self-assembling, spherical, closed colloidal structures that are composed of lipid bilayers that surround an aqueous space. The liposomes also help to increase the functionality and it helps to decrease the damage that the drug does to the heart muscles specifically. 
*Onivyde, liposome encapsulated irinotecan to treat metastatic pancreatic cancer, was approved by FDA in October 2015.
*Rapamune is a nanocrystal-based drug that was approved by the FDA in 2000 to prevent organ rejection after transplantation. The nanocrystal components allow for increased drug solubility and dissolution rate, leading to improved absorption and high bioavailability.
*Cabenuva is approved by FDA as cabotegravir extended-release injectable nano-suspension, plus rilpivirine extended-release injectable nano-suspension. It is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine. This is the first FDA-approved injectable, complete regimen for HIV-1 infected adults that is administered once a month.

== Imaging ==
&quot;In vivo&quot; imaging is another area where tools and devices are being developed. Using nanoparticle contrast agents, images such as ultrasound and MRI have a better distribution and improved contrast. In cardiovascular imaging, nanoparticles have potential to aid visualization of blood pooling, ischemia, angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and focal areas where inflammation is present.

The small size of nanoparticles gives them with properties that can be very useful in oncology, particularly in imaging. Quantum dots (nanoparticles with quantum confinement properties, such as size-tunable light emission), when used in conjunction with MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), can produce exceptional images of tumor sites. Nanoparticles of cadmium selenide (quantum dots) glow when exposed to ultraviolet light. When injected, they seep into cancer tumors. The surgeon can see the glowing tumor, and use it as a guide for more accurate tumor removal. These nanoparticles are much brighter than organic dyes and only need one light source for activation. This means that the use of fluorescent quantum dots could produce a higher contrast image and at a lower cost than today&#x27;s organic dyes used as contrast media. The downside, however, is that quantum dots are usually made of quite toxic elements, but this concern may be addressed by use of fluorescent dopants, substances added to create fluorescence.

Tracking movement can help determine how well drugs are being distributed or how substances are metabolized. It is difficult to track a small group of cells throughout the body, so scientists used to dye the cells. These dyes needed to be excited by light of a certain wavelength in order for them to light up. While different color dyes absorb different frequencies of light, there was a need for as many light sources as cells. A way around this problem is with luminescent tags. These tags are quantum dots attached to proteins that penetrate cell membranes. The dots can be random in size, can be made of bio-inert material, and they demonstrate the nanoscale property that color is size-dependent. As a result, sizes are selected so that the frequency of light used to make a group of quantum dots fluoresce is an even multiple of the frequency required to make another group incandesce. Then both groups can be lit with a single light source. They have also found a way to insert nanoparticles into the affected parts of the body so that those parts of the body will glow showing the tumor growth or shrinkage or also organ trouble.

== Sensing ==
Nanotechnology-on-a-chip is one more dimension of lab-on-a-chip technology. Magnetic nanoparticles, bound to a suitable antibody, are used to label specific molecules, structures or microorganisms. Silica nanoparticles, in particular, are inert from a photophysical perspective and can accumulate a large number of dye(s) within their shells. Gold nanoparticles tagged with short DNA segments can be used to detect genetic sequences in a sample. Multicolor optical coding for biological assays has been achieved by embedding different-sized quantum dots into polymeric microbeads. Nanopore technology for analysis of nucleic acids converts strings of nucleotides directly into electronic signatures.

Sensor test chips containing thousands of nanowires, able to detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells, could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the early stages from a few drops of a patient&#x27;s blood. Nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscopes, which are pencil-sized devices that are used in surgeries with lights and cameras so surgeons can do the surgeries with smaller incisions. The smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients. It is also helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a strand of hair.

Research on nanoelectronics-based cancer diagnostics could lead to tests that can be done in pharmacies. The results promise to be highly accurate and the product promises to be inexpensive. They could take a very small amount of blood and detect cancer anywhere in the body in about five minutes, with a sensitivity that is a thousand times better a conventional laboratory test. These devices are built with nanowires to detect cancer proteins; each nanowire detector is primed to be sensitive to a different cancer marker. The biggest advantage of the nanowire detectors is that they could test for anywhere from ten to one hundred similar medical conditions without adding cost to the testing device. Nanotechnology has also helped to personalize oncology for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. It is now able to be tailored to each individual&#x27;s tumor for better performance. They have found ways that they will be able to target a specific part of the body that is being affected by cancer.

==Sepsis treatment==

In contrast to dialysis, which works on the principle of the size-related diffusion of solutes and ultrafiltration of fluid across a semi-permeable membrane, the purification using nanoparticles allows specific targeting of substances. Additionally, larger compounds which are commonly not dialyzable can be removed.

The purification process is based on functionalized iron oxide or carbon coated metal nanoparticles with ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic properties. Binding agents such as proteins, antibiotics, or synthetic ligands are covalently linked to the particle surface. These binding agents are able to interact with target species forming an agglomerate. Applying an external magnetic field gradient exerts a force on the nanoparticles, allowing them to be separated from the bulk fluid, thus removing contaminants. This can neutralize the toxicity of sepsis, but runs the risk of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity.

The small size (&lt; 100 nm) and large surface area of functionalized nanomagnets offer advantages properties compared to hemoperfusion, which is a clinically used technique for the purification of blood and is based on surface adsorption. These advantages include high loading capacity, high selectivity towards the target compound, fast diffusion, low hydrodynamic resistance, and low dosage requirements.

== Tissue engineering ==
Nanotechnology may be used as part of tissue engineering to help reproduce, repair, or reshape damaged tissue using suitable nanomaterial-based scaffolds and growth factors. If successful, tissue engineering if successful may replace conventional treatments like organ transplants or artificial implants. Nanoparticles such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are being used as reinforcing agents to fabricate mechanically strong biodegradable polymeric nanocomposites for bone tissue engineering applications. The addition of these nanoparticles to the polymer matrix at low concentrations (~0.2 weight %) significantly improves in the compressive and flexural mechanical properties of polymeric nanocomposites. These nanocomposites may potentially serve as novel, mechanically strong, lightweight bone implants.

For example, a flesh welder was demonstrated to fuse two pieces of chicken meat into a single piece using a suspension of gold-coated nanoshells activated by an infrared laser. This could be used to weld arteries during surgery.
Another example is nanonephrology, the use of nanomedicine on the kidney.

The full potential and implications of nanotechnology uses within the tissue engineering are not yet fully understood, despite research spanning the past two decades.

== Vaccine development ==

Today, a significant proportion of vaccines against viral diseases are created using nanotechnology. Solid lipid nanoparticles represent a novel delivery system for some vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). In recent decades, nanosized adjuvants have been widely used to enhance immune responses to targeted vaccine antigens. Inorganic nanoparticles of aluminum, silica and clay, as well as organic nanoparticles based on polymers and lipids, are commonly used adjuvants within modern vaccine formulations. Nanoparticles of natural polymers such as chitosan are commonly used adjuvants in modern vaccine formulations. Ceria nanoparticles appear very promising for both enhancing vaccine responses and mitigating inflammation, as their adjuvanticity can be adjusted by modifying parameters such as size, crystallinity, surface state, and stoichiometry.

In addition, virus-like nanoparticles are also being researched. These structures allow vaccines to self-assemble without encapsulating viral RNA, making them non-infectious and incapable of replication. These virus-like nanoparticles are designed to elicit a strong immune response by using a self-assembled layer of virus capsid proteins.

=== Neuro-Electronic Interfacing ===
Neuro-electronic interfacing is a visionary goal dealing with the construction of nanodevices that will permit computers to connect and interact with the nervous system. This idea requires the building of a molecular structure that will permit control and detection of nerve impulses by an external computer. A refuelable system implies energy is refilled continuously or periodically with external sonic, chemical, tethered, magnetic, or biological electrical sources, while a non-refuelable system implies that all power is drawn from internal energy storage, ceasing operation once the energy is depleted. A nanoscale enzymatic biofuel cell for self-powered nanodevices have been developed, using glucose from biofluids such as human blood or watermelons. One limitation to this innovation is the potential for electrical interference, leakage, or overheating due to power consumption. The wiring of the structure is extremely difficult because they must be positioned precisely in the nervous system. The structures that will provide the interface must also be compatible with the body&#x27;s immune system. Current research is developing nanoparticle coatings for the electrodes to allow for improved recording and reduce interference. 

===Cell repair machines===
Molecular nanotechnology is a speculative subfield of nanotechnology that explores the potential to engineer molecular assemblers—machines capable of reorganizing matter at a molecular or atomic scale. Nanomedicine would make use of these nanorobots, introduced into the body, to repair or detect damages and infections. Molecular nanotechnology is highly theoretical, seeking to anticipate what inventions nanotechnology might yield and to propose an agenda for future inquiry. The proposed elements of molecular nanotechnology, such as molecular assemblers and nanorobots are far beyond current capabilities. Future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. K. Eric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology, postulated cell repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular machines, in his 1986 book &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;, with the first technical discussion of medical nanorobots by Robert Freitas appearing in 1999. Raymond Kurzweil, a futurist and transhumanist, stated in his book &quot;The Singularity Is Near&quot; that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030. According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him () the idea of a &quot;medical&quot; use for Feynman&#x27;s theoretical micromachines (see nanotechnology). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) &quot;swallow the doctor&quot;. The idea was incorporated into Feynman&#x27;s 1959 essay &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.&quot;

== Regulatory Impacts ==
As the development of nanomedicine continues to develop and becomes a potential treatments for diseases, regulatory challenges have come to light. This section will highlight some of the regulatory considerations and challenges faced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicine Agency (EMA), and each manufacturing organization. The major challenges that companies are reproducible manufacturing processes, scalability, availability of appropriate characterization methods, safety issues, and poor understandings of disease heterogeneity and patient preselection strategies. Despite these challenges, several therapeutic nanomedicine products have been approved by the FDA and EMA. In order to be approved for market, these therapies are evaluated for biocompatibility, immunotoxicity, as well as undergo a preclinical assessment. 

The current scope of approved nanomedicine are mainly nano-drugs, but as the field continued to grow and more applications of nanomedicine progress to a marketable scale, more impacts and regulatory oversight will be needed.

<text>In mathematical analysis, a null set is a Lebesgue measurable set of real numbers that has [[Lebesgue measure|measure]] zero. This can be characterized as a set that can be covered by a countable union of intervals of arbitrarily small total length. 

The notion of null set should not be confused with the empty set as defined in set theory. Although the empty set has Lebesgue measure zero, there are also non-empty sets which are null. For example, any non-empty countable set of real numbers has Lebesgue measure zero and therefore is null.

More generally, on a given measure space formula_1 a null set is a set formula_2 such that formula_3

==Examples==

Every finite or countably infinite subset of the real numbers is a null set. For example, the set of natural numbers , the set of rational numbers and the set of algebraic numbers are all countably infinite and therefore are null sets when considered as subsets of the real numbers.

The Cantor set is an example of an uncountable null set. It is uncountable because it contains all real numbers between 0 and 1 whose ternary form decimal expansion can be written using only 0’s and 2’s, and it is null because it is constructed by beginning with the closed interval of real numbers from 0 to 1 and multiplying the length by 2/3 continuously.

==Definition==

Suppose formula_4 is a subset of the real line formula_5 such that for every formula_6 there exists a sequence formula_7 of open intervals (where interval formula_8 has length formula_9 such that
formula_10
then formula_4 is a null set, also known as a set of zero-content.

In terminology of mathematical analysis, this definition requires that there be a sequence of open covers of formula_4 for which the limit of the lengths of the covers is zero.

==Properties==

Let formula_13 be a measure space. We have:

* formula_14 (by definition of formula_15).
* Any countable union of null sets is itself a null set (by countable subadditivity of formula_15).
* Any (measurable) subset of a null set is itself a null set (by monotonicity of formula_15).

Together, these facts show that the null sets of formula_13 form a 𝜎-ideal of the 𝜎-algebra formula_19. Accordingly, null sets may be interpreted as negligible sets, yielding a measure-theoretic notion of &quot;almost everywhere&quot;.

==Lebesgue measure==

The Lebesgue measure is the standard way of assigning a length, area or volume to subsets of Euclidean space.

A subset formula_20 of formula_5 has null Lebesgue measure and is considered to be a null set in formula_5 if and only if:
: Given any positive number formula_23 there is a sequence formula_24 of intervals in formula_5 such that formula_20 is contained in the union of the formula_24 and the total length of the union is less than formula_28
This condition can be generalised to formula_29 using formula_30-cubes instead of intervals. In fact, the idea can be made to make sense on any manifold, even if there is no Lebesgue measure there.

For instance:
* With respect to formula_29 all singleton sets are null, and therefore all countable sets are null. In particular, the set formula_32 of rational numbers is a null set, despite being dense in formula_33
* The standard construction of the Cantor set is an example of a null uncountable set in formula_34 however other constructions are possible which assign the Cantor set any measure whatsoever.
* All the subsets of formula_35 whose dimension is smaller than formula_30 have null Lebesgue measure in formula_37 For instance straight lines or circles are null sets in formula_38
* Sard&#x27;s lemma: the set of critical values of a smooth function has measure zero.

If formula_39 is Lebesgue measure for formula_5 and π is Lebesgue measure for formula_41, then the product measure formula_42 In terms of null sets, the following equivalence has been styled a Fubini&#x27;s theorem: 
* For formula_43 and formula_44 formula_45

==Uses==

Null sets play a key role in the definition of the Lebesgue integral: if functions formula_46 and formula_47 are equal except on a null set, then formula_46 is integrable if and only if formula_47 is, and their integrals are equal. This motivates the formal definition of formula_50 spaces as sets of equivalence classes of functions which differ only on null sets.

A measure in which all subsets of null sets are measurable is &quot;complete&quot;. Any non-complete measure can be completed to form a complete measure by asserting that subsets of null sets have measure zero. Lebesgue measure is an example of a complete measure; in some constructions, it is defined as the completion of a non-complete Borel measure.

===A subset of the Cantor set which is not Borel measurable===

The Borel measure is not complete. One simple construction is to start with the standard Cantor set formula_51 which is closed hence Borel measurable, and which has measure zero, and to find a subset formula_52 of formula_53 which is not Borel measurable. (Since the Lebesgue measure is complete, this formula_52 is of course Lebesgue measurable.)

First, we have to know that every set of positive measure contains a nonmeasurable subset. Let formula_46 be the Cantor function, a continuous function which is locally constant on formula_56 and monotonically increasing on formula_57 with formula_58 and formula_59 Obviously, formula_60 is countable, since it contains one point per component of formula_61 Hence formula_60 has measure zero, so formula_63 has measure one. We need a strictly monotonic function, so consider formula_64 Since formula_47 is strictly monotonic and continuous, it is a homeomorphism. Furthermore, formula_66 has measure one. Let formula_67 be non-measurable, and let formula_68 Because formula_47 is injective, we have that formula_70 and so formula_52 is a null set. However, if it were Borel measurable, then formula_72 would also be Borel measurable (here we use the fact that the preimage of a Borel set by a continuous function is measurable; formula_73 is the preimage of formula_52 through the continuous function formula_75). Therefore formula_52 is a null, but non-Borel measurable set.

==Haar null==

In a separable Banach space formula_77 addition moves any subset formula_78 to the translates formula_79 for any formula_80 When there is a probability measure on the σ-algebra of Borel subsets of formula_81 such that for all formula_82 formula_83 then formula_4 is a Haar null set.

The term refers to the null invariance of the measures of translates, associating it with the complete invariance found with Haar measure.

Some algebraic properties of topological groups have been related to the size of subsets and Haar null sets.
Haar null sets have been used in Polish groups to show that when is not a meagre set then formula_85 contains an open neighborhood of the identity element. This property is named for Hugo Steinhaus since it is the conclusion of the Steinhaus theorem.

<text>In machine learning, a neural network (also artificial neural network or neural net, abbreviated ANN or NN) is a model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in animal brains.

A neural network consists of connected units or nodes called &quot;artificial neurons&quot;, which loosely model the neurons in the brain. Artificial neuron models that mimic biological neurons more closely have also been recently investigated and shown to significantly improve performance. These are connected by &quot;edges&quot;, which model the synapses in the brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons. The &quot;signal&quot; is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs, called the &quot;activation function&quot;. The strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a &quot;weight&quot;, which adjusts during the learning process.

Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the &quot;input layer&quot;) to the last layer (the &quot;output layer&quot;), possibly passing through multiple intermediate layers (&quot;hidden layers&quot;). A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least two hidden layers.

Artificial neural networks are used for various tasks, including predictive modeling, adaptive control, and solving problems in artificial intelligence. They can learn from experience, and can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.

==Training==
Neural networks are typically trained through empirical risk minimization. This method is based on the idea of optimizing the network&#x27;s parameters to minimize the difference, or empirical risk, between the predicted output and the actual target values in a given dataset. Gradient-based methods such as backpropagation are usually used to estimate the parameters of the network. During the training phase, ANNs learn from labeled training data by iteratively updating their parameters to minimize a defined loss function. This method allows the network to generalize to unseen data.

==History==
=== Early work ===

Today&#x27;s deep neural networks are based on early work in statistics over 200 years ago. The simplest kind of feedforward neural network (FNN) is a linear network, which consists of a single layer of output nodes with linear activation functions; the inputs are fed directly to the outputs via a series of weights. The sum of the products of the weights and the inputs is calculated at each node. The mean squared errors between these calculated outputs and the given target values are minimized by creating an adjustment to the weights. This technique has been known for over two centuries as the method of least squares or linear regression. It was used as a means of finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points by Legendre (1805) and Gauss (1795) for the prediction of planetary movement.

Historically, digital computers such as the von Neumann model operate via the execution of explicit instructions with access to memory by a number of processors. Some neural networks, on the other hand, originated from efforts to model information processing in biological systems through the framework of connectionism. Unlike the von Neumann model, connectionist computing does not separate memory and processing.

Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) considered a non-learning computational model for neural networks. This model paved the way for research to split into two approaches. One approach focused on biological processes while the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence.

In the late 1940s, D. O. Hebb proposed a learning hypothesis based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that became known as Hebbian learning. It was used in many early neural networks, such as Rosenblatt&#x27;s perceptron and the Hopfield network. Farley and Clark (1954) used computational machines to simulate a Hebbian network. Other neural network computational machines were created by Rochester, Holland, Habit and Duda (1956). 

In 1958, psychologist Frank Rosenblatt described the perceptron, one of the first implemented artificial neural networks, funded by the United States Office of Naval Research.
R. D. Joseph (1960) mentions an even earlier perceptron-like device by Farley and Clark: &quot;Farley and Clark of MIT Lincoln Laboratory actually preceded Rosenblatt in the development of a perceptron-like device.&quot; However, &quot;they dropped the subject.&quot;
The perceptron raised public excitement for research in Artificial Neural Networks, causing the US government to drastically increase funding. This contributed to &quot;the Golden Age of AI&quot; fueled by the optimistic claims made by computer scientists regarding the ability of perceptrons to emulate human intelligence.

The first perceptrons did not have adaptive hidden units. However, Joseph (1960) also discussed multilayer perceptrons with an adaptive hidden layer. Rosenblatt (1962) cited and adopted these ideas, also crediting work by H. D. Block and B. W. Knight. Unfortunately, these early efforts did not lead to a working learning algorithm for hidden units, i.e., deep learning.

=== Deep learning breakthroughs in the 1960s and 1970s===
Fundamental research was conducted on ANNs in the 1960s and 1970s. The first working deep learning algorithm was the Group method of data handling, a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in the Soviet Union (1965). They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression, or a generalization of Rosenblatt&#x27;s perceptron. A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method, which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis. Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set. Since the activation functions of the nodes are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, these were also the first deep networks with multiplicative units or &quot;gates.&quot;

The first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent was published in 1967 by Shun&#x27;ichi Amari. In computer experiments conducted by Amari&#x27;s student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes. Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique.

In 1969, Kunihiko Fukushima introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function. The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning.

Nevertheless, research stagnated in the United States following the work of Minsky and Papert (1969), who emphasized that basic perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. This insight was irrelevant for the deep networks of Ivakhnenko (1965) and Amari (1967).

In 1976 transfer learning was introduced in neural networks learning. 

Deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers and weight replication began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, though not trained by backpropagation.

=== Backpropagation ===
Backpropagation is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673 to networks of differentiable nodes. The terminology &quot;back-propagating errors&quot; was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt, but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context of control theory. In 1970, Seppo Linnainmaa published the modern form of backpropagation in his Master&#x27;s thesis (1970). G.M. Ostrovski et al. republished it in 1971. Paul Werbos applied backpropagation to neural networks in 1982 (his 1974 PhD thesis, reprinted in a 1994 book, did not yet describe the algorithm). In 1986, David E. Rumelhart et al. popularised backpropagation but did not cite the original work.

=== Convolutional neural networks ===
Kunihiko Fukushima&#x27;s convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture of 1979 also introduced max pooling, a popular downsampling procedure for CNNs. CNNs have become an essential tool for computer vision.

The time delay neural network (TDNN) was introduced in 1987 by Alex Waibel to apply CNN to phoneme recognition. It used convolutions, weight sharing, and backpropagation. In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition.
In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. created a CNN called LeNet for recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. Training required 3 days. In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN on optical computing hardware. In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation and breast cancer detection in mammograms. LeNet-5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32×32 pixel images.

From 1988 onward, the use of neural networks transformed the field of protein structure prediction, in particular when the first cascading networks were trained on &quot;profiles&quot; (matrices) produced by multiple sequence alignments.

=== Recurrent neural networks ===
One origin of RNN was statistical mechanics. In 1972, Shun&#x27;ichi Amari proposed to modify the weights of an Ising model by Hebbian learning rule as a model of associative memory, adding in the component of learning. This was popularized as the Hopfield network by John Hopfield (1982). Another origin of RNN was neuroscience. The word &quot;recurrent&quot; is used to describe loop-like structures in anatomy. In 1901, Cajal observed &quot;recurrent semicircles&quot; in the cerebellar cortex. Hebb considered &quot;reverberating circuit&quot; as an explanation for short-term memory. The McCulloch and Pitts paper (1943) considered neural networks that contains cycles, and noted that the current activity of such networks can be affected by activity indefinitely far in the past.

In 1982 a recurrent neural network with an array architecture (rather than a multilayer perceptron architecture), namely a Crossbar Adaptive Array, used direct recurrent connections from the output to the supervisor (teaching) inputs. In addition of computing actions (decisions), it computed internal state evaluations (emotions) of the consequence situations. Eliminating the external supervisor, it introduced the self-learning method in neural networks. 

In cognitive psychology, the journal American Psychologist in early 1980&#x27;s carried out a debate on relation between cognition and emotion. Zajonc in 1980 stated that emotion is computed first and is independent from cognition, while Lazarus in 1982 stated that cognition is computed first and is inseparable from emotion. In 1982 the Crossbar Adaptive Array gave a neural network model of cognition-emotion relation. It was an example of a debate where an AI system, a recurrent neural network, contributed to an issue in the same time addressed by cognitive psychology.

Two early influential works were the Jordan network (1986) and the Elman network (1990), which applied RNN to study cognitive psychology. 

In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep RNNs. To overcome this problem, in 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed the &quot;neural sequence chunker&quot; or &quot;neural history compressor&quot; which introduced the important concepts of self-supervised pre-training (the &quot;P&quot; in ChatGPT) and neural knowledge distillation. In 1993, a neural history compressor system solved a &quot;Very Deep Learning&quot; task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time.

In 1991, Sepp Hochreiter&#x27;s diploma thesis identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem and proposed recurrent residual connections to solve it. He and Schmidhuber introduced long short-term memory (LSTM), which set accuracy records in multiple applications domains. This was not yet the modern version of LSTM, which required the forget gate, which was introduced in 1999. It became the default choice for RNN architecture.

During 1985–1995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed by Terry Sejnowski, Peter Dayan, Geoffrey Hinton, etc., including the Boltzmann machine, restricted Boltzmann machine, Helmholtz machine, and the wake-sleep algorithm. These were designed for unsupervised learning of deep generative models.

=== Deep learning ===
Between 2009 and 2012, ANNs began winning prizes in image recognition contests, approaching human level performance on various tasks, initially in pattern recognition and handwriting recognition. In 2011, a CNN named &quot;DanNet&quot; by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella, and Jürgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3. It then won more contests. They also showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU improved performance significantly.

In October 2012, AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. Further incremental improvements included the VGG-16 network by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman and Google&#x27;s Inceptionv3.

In 2012, Ng and Dean created a network that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images. Unsupervised pre-training and increased computing power from GPUs and distributed computing allowed the use of larger networks, particularly in image and visual recognition problems, which became known as &quot;deep learning&quot;.

Radial basis function and wavelet networks were introduced in 2013. These can be shown to offer best approximation properties and have been applied in nonlinear system identification and classification applications.

Generative adversarial network (GAN) (Ian Goodfellow et al., 2014) became state of the art in generative modeling during 2014–2018 period. The GAN principle was originally published in 1991 by Jürgen Schmidhuber who called it &quot;artificial curiosity&quot;: two neural networks contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game, where one network&#x27;s gain is the other network&#x27;s loss. The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia&#x27;s StyleGAN (2018) based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al. Here, the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion. Image generation by GAN reached popular success, and provoked discussions concerning deepfakes. Diffusion models (2015) eclipsed GANs in generative modeling since then, with systems such as DALL·E 2 (2022) and Stable Diffusion (2022).

In 2014, the state of the art was training &quot;very deep neural network&quot; with 20 to 30 layers. Stacking too many layers led to a steep reduction in training accuracy, known as the &quot;degradation&quot; problem. In 2015, two techniques were developed to train very deep networks: the highway network was published in May 2015, and the residual neural network (ResNet) in December 2015. ResNet behaves like an open-gated Highway Net. 

During the 2010s, the seq2seq model was developed, and attention mechanisms were added. It led to the modern Transformer architecture in 2017 in &quot;Attention Is All You Need&quot;.
It requires computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. Jürgen Schmidhuber&#x27;s fast weight controller (1992) scales linearly and was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.
Transformers have increasingly become the model of choice for natural language processing. Many modern large language models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and BERT use this architecture.

==Models==

ANNs began as an attempt to exploit the architecture of the human brain to perform tasks that conventional algorithms had little success with. They soon reoriented towards improving empirical results, abandoning attempts to remain true to their biological precursors. ANNs have the ability to learn and model non-linearities and complex relationships. This is achieved by neurons being connected in various patterns, allowing the output of some neurons to become the input of others. The network forms a directed, weighted graph.

An artificial neural network consists of simulated neurons. Each neuron is connected to other nodes via links like a biological axon-synapse-dendrite connection. All the nodes connected by links take in some data and use it to perform specific operations and tasks on the data. Each link has a weight, determining the strength of one node&#x27;s influence on another, allowing weights to choose the signal between neurons.

===Artificial neurons ===

ANNs are composed of artificial neurons which are conceptually derived from biological neurons. Each artificial neuron has inputs and produces a single output which can be sent to multiple other neurons. The inputs can be the feature values of a sample of external data, such as images or documents, or they can be the outputs of other neurons. The outputs of the final &quot;output neurons&quot; of the neural net accomplish the task, such as recognizing an object in an image.

To find the output of the neuron we take the weighted sum of all the inputs, weighted by the &quot;weights&quot; of the &quot;connections&quot; from the inputs to the neuron. We add a &quot;bias&quot; term to this sum. This weighted sum is sometimes called the &quot;activation&quot;. This weighted sum is then passed through a (usually nonlinear) activation function to produce the output. The initial inputs are external data, such as images and documents. The ultimate outputs accomplish the task, such as recognizing an object in an image.

=== Organization ===
The neurons are typically organized into multiple layers, especially in deep learning. Neurons of one layer connect only to neurons of the immediately preceding and immediately following layers. The layer that receives external data is the &quot;input layer&quot;. The layer that produces the ultimate result is the &quot;output layer&quot;. In between them are zero or more &quot;hidden layers&quot;. Single layer and unlayered networks are also used. Between two layers, multiple connection patterns are possible. They can be &#x27;fully connected&#x27;, with every neuron in one layer connecting to every neuron in the next layer. They can be &quot;pooling&quot;, where a group of neurons in one layer connects to a single neuron in the next layer, thereby reducing the number of neurons in that layer. Neurons with only such connections form a directed acyclic graph and are known as &quot;feedforward networks&quot;. Alternatively, networks that allow connections between neurons in the same or previous layers are known as &quot;recurrent networks&quot;.

=== Hyperparameter ===

A hyperparameter is a constant parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. The values of parameters are derived via learning. Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate, the number of hidden layers and batch size. The values of some hyperparameters can be dependent on those of other hyperparameters. For example, the size of some layers can depend on the overall number of layers.

===Learning===
Learning is the adaptation of the network to better handle a task by considering sample observations. Learning involves adjusting the weights (and optional thresholds) of the network to improve the accuracy of the result. This is done by minimizing the observed errors. Learning is complete when examining additional observations does not usefully reduce the error rate. Even after learning, the error rate typically does not reach 0. If after learning, the error rate is too high, the network typically must be redesigned. Practically this is done by defining a cost function that is evaluated periodically during learning. As long as its output continues to decline, learning continues. The cost is frequently defined as a statistic whose value can only be approximated. The outputs are actually numbers, so when the error is low, the difference between the output (almost certainly a cat) and the correct answer (cat) is small. Learning attempts to reduce the total of the differences across the observations. Most learning models can be viewed as a straightforward application of optimization theory and statistical estimation.

==== Learning rate ====

The learning rate defines the size of the corrective steps that the model takes to adjust for errors in each observation. A high learning rate shortens the training time, but with lower ultimate accuracy, while a lower learning rate takes longer, but with the potential for greater accuracy. Optimizations such as Quickprop are primarily aimed at speeding up error minimization, while other improvements mainly try to increase reliability. In order to avoid oscillation inside the network such as alternating connection weights, and to improve the rate of convergence, refinements use an adaptive learning rate that increases or decreases as appropriate. The concept of momentum allows the balance between the gradient and the previous change to be weighted such that the weight adjustment depends to some degree on the previous change. A momentum close to 0 emphasizes the gradient, while a value close to 1 emphasizes the last change.

====Cost function====
While it is possible to define a cost function ad hoc, frequently the choice is determined by the function&#x27;s desirable properties (such as convexity) or because it arises from the model (e.g. in a probabilistic model the model&#x27;s posterior probability can be used as an inverse cost).

====Backpropagation====

Backpropagation is a method used to adjust the connection weights to compensate for each error found during learning. The error amount is effectively divided among the connections. Technically, backpropagation calculates the gradient (the derivative) of the cost function associated with a given state with respect to the weights. The weight updates can be done via stochastic gradient descent or other methods, such as &quot;extreme learning machines&quot;, &quot;no-prop&quot; networks, training without backtracking, &quot;weightless&quot; networks, and non-connectionist neural networks.

===Learning paradigms===

Machine learning is commonly separated into three main learning paradigms, supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Each corresponds to a particular learning task.

==== Supervised learning ====
Supervised learning uses a set of paired inputs and desired outputs. The learning task is to produce the desired output for each input. In this case, the cost function is related to eliminating incorrect deductions. A commonly used cost is the mean-squared error, which tries to minimize the average squared error between the network&#x27;s output and the desired output. Tasks suited for supervised learning are pattern recognition (also known as classification) and regression (also known as function approximation). Supervised learning is also applicable to sequential data (e.g., for handwriting, speech and gesture recognition). This can be thought of as learning with a &quot;teacher&quot;, in the form of a function that provides continuous feedback on the quality of solutions obtained thus far.

====Unsupervised learning====
In unsupervised learning, input data is given along with the cost function, some function of the data formula_1 and the network&#x27;s output. The cost function is dependent on the task (the model domain) and any &quot;a priori&quot; assumptions (the implicit properties of the model, its parameters and the observed variables). As a trivial example, consider the model formula_2 where formula_3 is a constant and the cost formula_4. Minimizing this cost produces a value of formula_3 that is equal to the mean of the data. The cost function can be much more complicated. Its form depends on the application: for example, in compression it could be related to the mutual information between formula_1 and formula_7, whereas in statistical modeling, it could be related to the posterior probability of the model given the data (note that in both of those examples, those quantities would be maximized rather than minimized). Tasks that fall within the paradigm of unsupervised learning are in general estimation problems; the applications include clustering, the estimation of statistical distributions, compression and filtering.

====Reinforcement learning====

In applications such as playing video games, an actor takes a string of actions, receiving a generally unpredictable response from the environment after each one. The goal is to win the game, i.e., generate the most positive (lowest cost) responses. In reinforcement learning, the aim is to weight the network (devise a policy) to perform actions that minimize long-term (expected cumulative) cost. At each point in time the agent performs an action and the environment generates an observation and an instantaneous cost, according to some (usually unknown) rules. The rules and the long-term cost usually only can be estimated. At any juncture, the agent decides whether to explore new actions to uncover their costs or to exploit prior learning to proceed more quickly.

Formally the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) with states formula_8 and actions formula_9. Because the state transitions are not known, probability distributions are used instead: the instantaneous cost distribution formula_10, the observation distribution formula_11 and the transition distribution formula_12, while a policy is defined as the conditional distribution over actions given the observations. Taken together, the two define a Markov chain (MC). The aim is to discover the lowest-cost MC.

ANNs serve as the learning component in such applications. Dynamic programming coupled with ANNs (giving neurodynamic programming) has been applied to problems such as those involved in vehicle routing, video games, natural resource management and medicine because of ANNs ability to mitigate losses of accuracy even when reducing the discretization grid density for numerically approximating the solution of control problems. Tasks that fall within the paradigm of reinforcement learning are control problems, games and other sequential decision making tasks.

====Self-learning====

Self-learning in neural networks was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning named &quot;crossbar adaptive array&quot; (CAA). It is a system with only one input, situation s, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. It has neither external advice input nor external reinforcement input from the environment. The CAA computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about encountered situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. Given the memory matrix, W =||w(a,s)||, the crossbar self-learning algorithm in each iteration performs the following computation:
 In situation s perform action a;
 Receive consequence situation s&#x27;;
 Compute emotion of being in consequence situation v(s&#x27;);
 Update crossbar memory w&#x27;(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s&#x27;).

The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is genetic environment, where from it initially and only once receives initial emotions about to be encountered situations in the behavioral environment. Having received the genome vector (species vector) from the genetic environment, the CAA will learn a goal-seeking behavior, in the behavioral environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.

==== Neuroevolution ====
Neuroevolution can create neural network topologies and weights using evolutionary computation. It is competitive with sophisticated gradient descent approaches. One advantage of neuroevolution is that it may be less prone to get caught in &quot;dead ends&quot;.

===Stochastic neural network===

Stochastic neural networks originating from Sherrington–Kirkpatrick models are a type of artificial neural network built by introducing random variations into the network, either by giving the network&#x27;s artificial neurons stochastic transfer functions , or by giving them stochastic weights. This makes them useful tools for optimization problems, since the random fluctuations help the network escape from local minima. Stochastic neural networks trained using a Bayesian approach are known as Bayesian neural networks.

===Topological deep learning===
Topological deep learning, first introduced in 2017, is an emerging approach in machine learning that integrates topology with deep neural networks to address highly intricate and high-order data. Initially rooted in algebraic topology, TDL has since evolved into a versatile framework incorporating tools from other mathematical disciplines, such as differential topology and geometric topology. As a successful example of mathematical deep learning, TDL continues to inspire advancements in mathematical artificial intelligence, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between AI and mathematics. 

===Other===
In a Bayesian framework, a distribution over the set of allowed models is chosen to minimize the cost. Evolutionary methods, gene expression programming, simulated annealing, expectation–maximization, non-parametric methods and particle swarm optimization are other learning algorithms. Convergent recursion is a learning algorithm for cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural networks.

==== Modes ====

Two modes of learning are available: stochastic and batch. In stochastic learning, each input creates a weight adjustment. In batch learning weights are adjusted based on a batch of inputs, accumulating errors over the batch. Stochastic learning introduces &quot;noise&quot; into the process, using the local gradient calculated from one data point; this reduces the chance of the network getting stuck in local minima. However, batch learning typically yields a faster, more stable descent to a local minimum, since each update is performed in the direction of the batch&#x27;s average error. A common compromise is to use &quot;mini-batches&quot;, small batches with samples in each batch selected stochastically from the entire data set.

== Types ==

ANNs have evolved into a broad family of techniques that have advanced the state of the art across multiple domains. The simplest types have one or more static components, including number of units, number of layers, unit weights and topology. Dynamic types allow one or more of these to evolve via learning. The latter is much more complicated but can shorten learning periods and produce better results. Some types allow/require learning to be &quot;supervised&quot; by the operator, while others operate independently. Some types operate purely in hardware, while others are purely software and run on general purpose computers.

Some of the main breakthroughs include: 

* Convolutional neural networks that have proven particularly successful in processing visual and other two-dimensional data; where long short-term memory avoids the vanishing gradient problem and can handle signals that have a mix of low and high frequency components aiding large-vocabulary speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and photo-real talking heads; 
* Competitive networks such as generative adversarial networks in which multiple networks (of varying structure) compete with each other, on tasks such as winning a game or on deceiving the opponent about the authenticity of an input.

== Network design ==
Using artificial neural networks requires an understanding of their characteristics.
* Choice of model: This depends on the data representation and the application. Model parameters include the number, type, and connectedness of network layers, as well as the size of each and the connection type (full, pooling, etc. ). Overly complex models learn slowly.
* Learning algorithm: Numerous trade-offs exist between learning algorithms. Almost any algorithm will work well with the correct hyperparameters for training on a particular data set. However, selecting and tuning an algorithm for training on unseen data requires significant experimentation.
* Robustness: If the model, cost function and learning algorithm are selected appropriately, the resulting ANN can become robust.

Neural architecture search (NAS) uses machine learning to automate ANN design. Various approaches to NAS have designed networks that compare well with hand-designed systems. The basic search algorithm is to propose a candidate model, evaluate it against a dataset, and use the results as feedback to teach the NAS network. Available systems include AutoML and AutoKeras. scikit-learn library provides functions to help with building a deep network from scratch. We can then implement a deep network with TensorFlow or Keras.

Hyperparameters must also be defined as part of the design (they are not learned), governing matters such as how many neurons are in each layer, learning rate, step, stride, depth, receptive field and padding (for CNNs), etc. 

== Applications ==
Because of their ability to reproduce and model nonlinear processes, artificial neural networks have found applications in many disciplines. These include:
* Function approximation, or regression analysis, (including time series prediction, fitness approximation, and modeling)
* Data processing (including filtering, clustering, blind source separation, and compression)
* Nonlinear system identification and control (including vehicle control, trajectory prediction, adaptive control, process control, and natural resource management)
* Pattern recognition (including radar systems, face identification, signal classification, novelty detection, 3D reconstruction, object recognition, and sequential decision making)
* Sequence recognition (including gesture, speech, and handwritten and printed text recognition)
* Sensor data analysis (including image analysis)
* Robotics (including directing manipulators and prostheses)
* Data mining (including knowledge discovery in databases)
* Finance (such as ex-ante models for specific financial long-run forecasts and artificial financial markets)
* Quantum chemistry
* General game playing
* Generative AI
* Data visualization
* Machine translation
* Social network filtering
* E-mail spam filtering
* Medical diagnosis

ANNs have been used to diagnose several types of cancers and to distinguish highly invasive cancer cell lines from less invasive lines using only cell shape information.

ANNs have been used to accelerate reliability analysis of infrastructures subject to natural disasters and to predict foundation settlements. It can also be useful to mitigate flood by the use of ANNs for modelling rainfall-runoff. ANNs have also been used for building black-box models in geoscience: hydrology, ocean modelling and coastal engineering, and geomorphology. ANNs have been employed in cybersecurity, with the objective to discriminate between legitimate activities and malicious ones. For example, machine learning has been used for classifying Android malware, for identifying domains belonging to threat actors and for detecting URLs posing a security risk. Research is underway on ANN systems designed for penetration testing, for detecting botnets, credit cards frauds and network intrusions.

ANNs have been proposed as a tool to solve partial differential equations in physics and simulate the properties of many-body open quantum systems. In brain research ANNs have studied short-term behavior of individual neurons, the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems. Studies considered long-and short-term plasticity of neural systems and their relation to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level.

It is possible to create a profile of a user&#x27;s interests from pictures, using artificial neural networks trained for object recognition.

Beyond their traditional applications, artificial neural networks are increasingly being utilized in interdisciplinary research, such as materials science. For instance, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their capability in scaling deep learning for the discovery of new stable materials by efficiently predicting the total energy of crystals. This application underscores the adaptability and potential of ANNs in tackling complex problems beyond the realms of predictive modeling and artificial intelligence, opening new pathways for scientific discovery and innovation.

==Theoretical properties==
===Computational power===
The multilayer perceptron is a universal function approximator, as proven by the universal approximation theorem. However, the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required, the network topology, the weights and the learning parameters.

A specific recurrent architecture with rational-valued weights (as opposed to full precision real number-valued weights) has the power of a universal Turing machine, using a finite number of neurons and standard linear connections. Further, the use of irrational values for weights results in a machine with super-Turing power.

===Capacity===
A model&#x27;s &quot;capacity&quot; property corresponds to its ability to model any given function. It is related to the amount of information that can be stored in the network and to the notion of complexity.
Two notions of capacity are known by the community. The information capacity and the VC Dimension. The information capacity of a perceptron is intensively discussed in Sir David MacKay&#x27;s book which summarizes work by Thomas Cover. The capacity of a network of standard neurons (not convolutional) can be derived by four rules that derive from understanding a neuron as an electrical element. The information capacity captures the functions modelable by the network given any data as input. The second notion, is the VC dimension. VC Dimension uses the principles of measure theory and finds the maximum capacity under the best possible circumstances. This is, given input data in a specific form. As noted in, the VC Dimension for arbitrary inputs is half the information capacity of a Perceptron. The VC Dimension for arbitrary points is sometimes referred to as Memory Capacity.

===Convergence===
Models may not consistently converge on a single solution, firstly because local minima may exist, depending on the cost function and the model. Secondly, the optimization method used might not guarantee to converge when it begins far from any local minimum. Thirdly, for sufficiently large data or parameters, some methods become impractical.

Another issue worthy to mention is that training may cross some Saddle point which may lead the convergence to the wrong direction.

The convergence behavior of certain types of ANN architectures are more understood than others. When the width of network approaches to infinity, the ANN is well described by its first order Taylor expansion throughout training, and so inherits the convergence behavior of affine models. Another example is when parameters are small, it is observed that ANNs often fits target functions from low to high frequencies. This behavior is referred to as the spectral bias, or frequency principle, of neural networks. This phenomenon is the opposite to the behavior of some well studied iterative numerical schemes such as Jacobi method. Deeper neural networks have been observed to be more biased towards low frequency functions.

===Generalization and statistics===

Applications whose goal is to create a system that generalizes well to unseen examples, face the possibility of over-training. This arises in convoluted or over-specified systems when the network capacity significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. Two approaches address over-training. The first is to use cross-validation and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-training and to select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error.

The second is to use some form of &quot;regularization&quot;. This concept emerges in a probabilistic (Bayesian) framework, where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models; but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over two quantities: the &#x27;empirical risk&#x27; and the &#x27;structural risk&#x27;, which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting.
Supervised neural networks that use a mean squared error (MSE) cost function can use formal statistical methods to determine the confidence of the trained model. The MSE on a validation set can be used as an estimate for variance. This value can then be used to calculate the confidence interval of network output, assuming a normal distribution. A confidence analysis made this way is statistically valid as long as the output probability distribution stays the same and the network is not modified.

By assigning a softmax activation function, a generalization of the logistic function, on the output layer of the neural network (or a softmax component in a component-based network) for categorical target variables, the outputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities. This is useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications.

The softmax activation function is:

:formula_13
&lt;section end=&quot;theory&quot; /&gt;

==Criticism==

===Training ===
A common criticism of neural networks, particularly in robotics, is that they require too many training samples for real-world operation.
Any learning machine needs sufficient representative examples in order to capture the underlying structure that allows it to generalize to new cases. Potential solutions include randomly shuffling training examples, by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the network connections following an example, grouping examples in so-called mini-batches and/or introducing a recursive least squares algorithm for CMAC.
Dean Pomerleau uses a neural network to train a robotic vehicle to drive on multiple types of roads (single lane, multi-lane, dirt, etc.), and a large amount of his research is devoted to extrapolating multiple training scenarios from a single training experience, and preserving past training diversity so that the system does not become overtrained (if, for example, it is presented with a series of right turns—it should not learn to always turn right).

===Theory===

A central claim of ANNs is that they embody new and powerful general principles for processing information. These principles are ill-defined. It is often claimed that they are emergent from the network itself. This allows simple statistical association (the basic function of artificial neural networks) to be described as learning or recognition. In 1997, Alexander Dewdney, a former &quot;Scientific American&quot; columnist, commented that as a result, artificial neural networks have a &quot;something-for-nothing quality, one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness and a distinct lack of curiosity about just how good these computing systems are. No human hand (or mind) intervenes; solutions are found as if by magic; and no one, it seems, has learned anything&quot;. One response to Dewdney is that neural networks have been successfully used to handle many complex and diverse tasks, ranging from autonomously flying aircraft to detecting credit card fraud to mastering the game of Go.

Technology writer Roger Bridgman commented:

Although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult, it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network. Moreover, recent emphasis on the explainability of AI has contributed towards the development of methods, notably those based on attention mechanisms, for visualizing and explaining learned neural networks. Furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering generic principles that allow a learning machine to be successful. For example, Bengio and LeCun (2007) wrote an article regarding local vs non-local learning, as well as shallow vs deep architecture.

Biological brains use both shallow and deep circuits as reported by brain anatomy, displaying a wide variety of invariance. Weng argued that the brain self-wires largely according to signal statistics and therefore, a serial cascade cannot catch all major statistical dependencies.

===Hardware===
Large and effective neural networks require considerable computing resources. While the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons, simulating even a simplified neuron on von Neumann architecture may consume vast amounts of memory and storage. Furthermore, the designer often needs to transmit signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons which require enormous CPU power and time.

Some argue that the resurgence of neural networks in the twenty-first century is largely attributable to advances in hardware: from 1991 to 2015, computing power, especially as delivered by GPGPUs (on GPUs), has increased around a million-fold, making the standard backpropagation algorithm feasible for training networks that are several layers deeper than before. The use of accelerators such as FPGAs and GPUs can reduce training times from months to days.

Neuromorphic engineering or a physical neural network addresses the hardware difficulty directly, by constructing non-von-Neumann chips to directly implement neural networks in circuitry. Another type of chip optimized for neural network processing is called a Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU.

===Practical counterexamples ===
Analyzing what has been learned by an ANN is much easier than analyzing what has been learned by a biological neural network. Furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful. For example, local vs. non-local learning and shallow vs. deep architecture.

===Hybrid approaches===
Advocates of hybrid models (combining neural networks and symbolic approaches) say that such a mixture can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind.

=== Dataset bias ===
Neural networks are dependent on the quality of the data they are trained on, thus low quality data with imbalanced representativeness can lead to the model learning and perpetuating societal biases. These inherited biases become especially critical when the ANNs are integrated into real-world scenarios where the training data may be imbalanced due to the scarcity of data for a specific race, gender or other attribute. This imbalance can result in the model having inadequate representation and understanding of underrepresented groups, leading to discriminatory outcomes that exacerbate societal inequalities, especially in applications like facial recognition, hiring processes, and law enforcement. For example, in 2018, Amazon had to scrap a recruiting tool because the model favored men over women for jobs in software engineering due to the higher number of male workers in the field. The program would penalize any resume with the word &quot;woman&quot; or the name of any women&#x27;s college. However, the use of synthetic data can help reduce dataset bias and increase representation in datasets.

== Recent advancements and future directions ==
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have undergone significant advancements, particularly in their ability to model complex systems, handle large data sets, and adapt to various types of applications. Their evolution over the past few decades has been marked by a broad range of applications in fields such as image processing, speech recognition, natural language processing, finance, and medicine.

=== Image processing ===
In the realm of image processing, ANNs are employed in tasks such as image classification, object recognition, and image segmentation. For instance, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been important in handwritten digit recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This demonstrates the ability of ANNs to effectively process and interpret complex visual information, leading to advancements in fields ranging from automated surveillance to medical imaging.

=== Speech recognition ===
By modeling speech signals, ANNs are used for tasks like speaker identification and speech-to-text conversion. Deep neural network architectures have introduced significant improvements in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, outperforming traditional techniques. These advancements have enabled the development of more accurate and efficient voice-activated systems, enhancing user interfaces in technology products.

=== Natural language processing ===
In natural language processing, ANNs are used for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. They have enabled the development of models that can accurately translate between languages, understand the context and sentiment in textual data, and categorize text based on content. This has implications for automated customer service, content moderation, and language understanding technologies.

=== Control systems ===
In the domain of control systems, ANNs are used to model dynamic systems for tasks such as system identification, control design, and optimization. For instance, deep feedforward neural networks are important in system identification and control applications.

=== Finance ===

ANNs are used for stock market prediction and credit scoring: 
*In investing, ANNs can process vast amounts of financial data, recognize complex patterns, and forecast stock market trends, aiding investors and risk managers in making informed decisions. 
*In credit scoring, ANNs offer data-driven, personalized assessments of creditworthiness, improving the accuracy of default predictions and automating the lending process. 
ANNs require high-quality data and careful tuning, and their &quot;black-box&quot; nature can pose challenges in interpretation. Nevertheless, ongoing advancements suggest that ANNs continue to play a role in finance, offering valuable insights and enhancing risk management strategies.

=== Medicine ===
ANNs are able to process and analyze vast medical datasets. They enhance diagnostic accuracy, especially by interpreting complex medical imaging for early disease detection, and by predicting patient outcomes for personalized treatment planning. In drug discovery, ANNs speed up the identification of potential drug candidates and predict their efficacy and safety, significantly reducing development time and costs. Additionally, their application in personalized medicine and healthcare data analysis allows tailored therapies and efficient patient care management. Ongoing research is aimed at addressing remaining challenges such as data privacy and model interpretability, as well as expanding the scope of ANN applications in medicine.

=== Content creation ===
ANNs such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) and transformers are used for content creation across numerous industries. This is because deep learning models are able to learn the style of an artist or musician from huge datasets and generate completely new artworks and music compositions. For instance, DALL-E is a deep neural network trained on 650 million pairs of images and texts across the internet that can create artworks based on text entered by the user. In the field of music, transformers are used to create original music for commercials and documentaries through companies such as AIVA and Jukedeck. In the marketing industry generative models are used to create personalized advertisements for consumers. Additionally, major film companies are partnering with technology companies to analyze the financial success of a film, such as the partnership between Warner Bros and technology company Cinelytic established in 2020. Furthermore, neural networks have found uses in video game creation, where Non Player Characters (NPCs) can make decisions based on all the characters currently in the game.

<doc id="21525" wikidata="Q2138622" url="?curid=21525" title="Nutrition">
<text>Nutrition is the biochemical and physiological process by which an organism uses food to support its life. It provides organisms with nutrients, which can be metabolized to create energy and chemical structures. Failure to obtain the required amount of nutrients causes malnutrition. Nutritional science is the study of nutrition, though it typically emphasizes human nutrition.

The type of organism determines what nutrients it needs and how it obtains them. Organisms obtain nutrients by consuming organic matter, consuming inorganic matter, absorbing light, or some combination of these. Some can produce nutrients internally by consuming basic elements, while some must consume other organisms to obtain pre-existing nutrients. All forms of life require carbon, energy, and water as well as various other molecules. Animals require complex nutrients such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, obtaining them by consuming other organisms. Humans have developed agriculture and cooking to replace foraging and advance human nutrition. Plants acquire nutrients through the soil and the atmosphere. Fungi absorb nutrients around them by breaking them down and absorbing them through the mycelium.

== History ==

Scientific analysis of food and nutrients began during the chemical revolution in the late 18th century. Chemists in the 18th and 19th centuries experimented with different elements and food sources to develop theories of nutrition. Modern nutrition science began in the 1910s as individual micronutrients began to be identified. The first vitamin to be chemically identified was thiamine in 1926, and vitamin C was identified as a protection against scurvy in 1932. The role of vitamins in nutrition was studied in the following decades. The first recommended dietary allowances for humans were developed to address fears of disease caused by food deficiencies during the Great Depression and the Second World War. Due to its importance in human health, the study of nutrition has heavily emphasized human nutrition and agriculture, while ecology is a secondary concern.

== Nutrients ==

Nutrients are substances that provide energy and physical components to the organism, allowing it to survive, grow, and reproduce. Nutrients can be basic elements or complex macromolecules. Approximately 30 elements are found in organic matter, with nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus being the most important. Macronutrients are the primary substances required by an organism, and micronutrients are substances required by an organism in trace amounts. Organic micronutrients are classified as vitamins, and inorganic micronutrients are classified as minerals. Nutrients can also be classified as essential or nonessential, with essential meaning the body cannot synthesize the nutrient on its own.

Nutrients are absorbed by the cells and used in metabolic biochemical reactions. These include fueling reactions that create precursor metabolites and energy, biosynthetic reactions that convert precursor metabolites into building block molecules, polymerizations that combine these molecules into macromolecule polymers, and assembly reactions that use these polymers to construct cellular structures.

=== Nutritional groups ===

Organisms can be classified by how they obtain carbon and energy. Heterotrophs are organisms that obtain nutrients by consuming the carbon of other organisms, while autotrophs are organisms that produce their own nutrients from the carbon of inorganic substances like carbon dioxide. Mixotrophs are organisms that can be heterotrophs and autotrophs, including some plankton and carnivorous plants. Phototrophs obtain energy from light, while chemotrophs obtain energy by consuming chemical energy from matter. Organotrophs consume other organisms to obtain electrons, while lithotrophs obtain electrons from inorganic substances, such as water, hydrogen sulfide, dihydrogen, iron(II), sulfur, or ammonium. Prototrophs can create essential nutrients from other compounds, while auxotrophs must consume preexisting nutrients.

=== Diet ===
In nutrition, the diet of an organism is the sum of the foods it eats. A healthy diet improves the physical and mental health of an organism. This requires ingestion and absorption of vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids from protein and essential fatty acids from fat-containing food. Carbohydrates, protein and fat play major roles in ensuring the quality of life, health and longevity of the organism. Some cultures and religions have restrictions on what is acceptable for their diet.

=== Nutrient cycle ===
A nutrient cycle is a biogeochemical cycle involving the movement of inorganic matter through a combination of soil, organisms, air or water, where they are exchanged in organic matter. Energy flow is a unidirectional and noncyclic pathway, whereas the movement of mineral nutrients is cyclic. Mineral cycles include the carbon cycle, sulfur cycle, nitrogen cycle, water cycle, phosphorus cycle, and oxygen cycle, among others that continually recycle along with other mineral nutrients into productive ecological nutrition.

Biogeochemical cycles that are performed by living organisms and natural processes are water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycles. Nutrient cycles allow these essential elements to return to the environment after being absorbed or consumed. Without proper nutrient cycling, there would be risk of change in oxygen levels, climate, and ecosystem function.

=== Foraging ===
Foraging is the process of seeking out nutrients in the environment. It may also be defined to include the subsequent use of the resources. Some organisms, such as animals and bacteria, can navigate to find nutrients, while others, such as plants and fungi, extend outward to find nutrients. Foraging may be random, in which the organism seeks nutrients without method, or it may be systematic, in which the organism can go directly to a food source. Organisms are able to detect nutrients through taste or other forms of nutrient sensing, allowing them to regulate nutrient intake. Optimal foraging theory is a model that explains foraging behavior as a cost–benefit analysis in which an animal must maximize the gain of nutrients while minimizing the amount of time and energy spent foraging. It was created to analyze the foraging habits of animals, but it can also be extended to other organisms. Some organisms are specialists that are adapted to forage for a single food source, while others are generalists that can consume a variety of food sources.

== Nutrient deficiency ==

Nutrient deficiencies, known as malnutrition, occur when an organism does not have the nutrients that it needs. This may be caused by suddenly losing nutrients or the inability to absorb proper nutrients. Not only is malnutrition the result of a lack of necessary nutrients, but it can also be a result of other illnesses and health conditions. When this occurs, an organism will adapt by reducing energy consumption and expenditure to prolong the use of stored nutrients. It will use stored energy reserves until they are depleted, and it will then break down its own body mass for additional energy.

A balanced diet includes appropriate amounts of all essential and non-essential nutrients. These can vary by age, weight, sex, physical activity levels, and more. A lack of just one essential nutrient can cause bodily harm, just as an overabundance can cause toxicity. The Daily Reference Values keep the majority of people from nutrient deficiencies. DRVs are not recommendations but a combination of nutrient references to educate professionals and policymakers on what the maximum and minimum nutrient intakes are for the average person. Food labels also use DRVs as a reference to create safe nutritional guidelines for the average healthy person.

== In organisms ==

=== Animal ===
Animals are heterotrophs that consume other organisms to obtain nutrients. Herbivores are animals that eat plants, carnivores are animals that eat other animals, and omnivores are animals that eat both plants and other animals. Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose, while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize. Animals generally have a higher requirement of energy in comparison to plants. The macronutrients essential to animal life are carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids.

All macronutrients except water are required by the body for energy, however, this is not their sole physiological function. The energy provided by macronutrients in food is measured in kilocalories, usually called Calories, where 1 Calorie is the amount of energy required to raise 1 kilogram of water by 1 degree Celsius.

Carbohydrates are molecules that store significant amounts of energy. Animals digest and metabolize carbohydrates to obtain this energy. Carbohydrates are typically synthesized by plants during metabolism, and animals have to obtain most carbohydrates from nature, as they have only a limited ability to generate them. They include sugars, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. Glucose is the simplest form of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates are broken down to produce glucose and short-chain fatty acids, and they are the most abundant nutrients for herbivorous land animals. Carbohydrates contain 4 calories per gram.

Lipids provide animals with fats and oils. They are not soluble in water, and they can store energy for an extended period of time. They can be obtained from many different plant and animal sources. Most dietary lipids are triglycerides, composed of glycerol and fatty acids. Phospholipids and sterols are found in smaller amounts. An animal&#x27;s body will reduce the amount of fatty acids it produces as dietary fat intake increases, while it increases the amount of fatty acids it produces as carbohydrate intake increases. Fats contain 9 calories per gram.

Protein consumed by animals is broken down to amino acids, which would be later used to synthesize new proteins. Protein is used to form cellular structures, fluids, and enzymes (biological catalysts). Enzymes are essential to most metabolic processes, as well as DNA replication, repair, and transcription. Protein contains 4 calories per gram.

Much of animal behavior is governed by nutrition. Migration patterns and seasonal breeding take place in conjunction with food availability, and courtship displays are used to display an animal&#x27;s health. Animals develop positive and negative associations with foods that affect their health, and they can instinctively avoid foods that have caused toxic injury or nutritional imbalances through a conditioned food aversion. Some animals, such as rats, do not seek out new types of foods unless they have a nutrient deficiency.

==== Human ====

Early human nutrition consisted of foraging for nutrients, like other animals, but it diverged at the beginning of the Holocene with the Neolithic Revolution, in which humans developed agriculture to produce food. The Chemical Revolution in the 18th century allowed humans to study the nutrients in foods and develop more advanced methods of food preparation. Major advances in economics and technology during the 20th century allowed mass production and food fortification to better meet the nutritional needs of humans. Human behavior is closely related to human nutrition, making it a subject of social science in addition to biology. Nutrition in humans is balanced with eating for pleasure, and optimal diet may vary depending on the demographics and health concerns of each person.

Humans are omnivores that eat a variety of foods. Cultivation of cereals and production of bread has made up a key component of human nutrition since the beginning of agriculture. Early humans hunted animals for meat, and modern humans domesticate animals to consume their meat and eggs. The development of animal husbandry has also allowed humans in some cultures to consume the milk of other animals and process it into foods such as cheese. Other foods eaten by humans include nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables. Access to domesticated animals as well as vegetable oils has caused a significant increase in human intake of fats and oils. Humans have developed advanced methods of food processing that prevent contamination of pathogenic microorganisms and simplify the production of food. These include drying, freezing, heating, milling, pressing, packaging, refrigeration, and irradiation. Most cultures add herbs and spices to foods before eating to add flavor, though most do not significantly affect nutrition. Other additives are also used to improve the safety, quality, flavor, and nutritional content of food.

Humans obtain most carbohydrates as starch from cereals, though sugar has grown in importance. Lipids can be found in animal fat, butterfat, vegetable oil, and leaf vegetables, and they are also used to increase flavor in foods. Protein can be found in virtually all foods, as it makes up cellular material, though certain methods of food processing may reduce the amount of protein in a food. Humans can also obtain energy from ethanol, which is both a food and a drug, but it provides relatively few essential nutrients and is associated with nutritional deficiencies and other health risks.

In humans, poor nutrition can cause deficiency-related diseases, such as blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and cretinism, or nutrient-excess conditions, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. Other conditions possibly affected by nutrition disorders include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Undernutrition can lead to wasting in acute cases, and stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition.

==== Domesticated animal ====
In domesticated animals, such as pets, livestock, and working animals, as well as other animals in captivity, nutrition is managed by humans through animal feed. Fodder and forage are provided to livestock. Specialized pet food has been manufactured since 1860, and subsequent research and development have addressed the nutritional needs of pets. Dog food and cat food in particular are heavily studied and typically include all essential nutrients for these animals. Cats are sensitive to some common nutrients, such as taurine, and require additional nutrients derived from meat. Large-breed puppies are susceptible to overnutrition, as small-breed dog food is more energy dense than they can absorb.

=== Plant ===
Most plants obtain nutrients through inorganic substances absorbed from the soil or the atmosphere. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur are essential nutrients that make up organic material in a plant and allow enzymic processes. These are absorbed ions in the soil, such as bicarbonate, nitrate, ammonium, and sulfate, or they are absorbed as gases, such as carbon dioxide, water, oxygen gas, and sulfur dioxide. Phosphorus, boron, and silicon are used for esterification. They are obtained through the soil as phosphates, boric acid, and silicic acid, respectively. Other nutrients used by plants are potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, chlorine, iron, copper, zinc, and molybdenum.

Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. Although nitrogen is plentiful in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, very few plants can use this directly. Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a nitrogen fixation process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.

As these nutrients do not provide the plant with energy, they must obtain energy by other means. Green plants absorb energy from sunlight with chloroplasts and convert it to usable energy through photosynthesis.

=== Fungus ===

Fungi are chemoheterotrophs that consume external matter for energy. Most fungi absorb matter through the root-like mycelium, which grows through the organism&#x27;s source of nutrients and can extend indefinitely. The fungus excretes extracellular enzymes to break down surrounding matter and then absorbs the nutrients through the cell wall. Fungi can be parasitic, saprophytic, or symbiotic. Parasitic fungi attach and feed on living hosts, such as animals, plants, or other fungi. Saprophytic fungi feed on dead and decomposing organisms. Symbiotic fungi grow around other organisms and exchange nutrients with them.

=== Protist ===
Protists include all eukaryotes that are not animals, plants, or fungi, resulting in great diversity between them. Algae are photosynthetic protists that can produce energy from light. Several types of protists use mycelium similar to those of fungi. Protozoa are heterotrophic protists, and different protozoa seek nutrients in different ways. Flagellate protozoa use a flagellum to assist in hunting for food, and some protozoa travel via infectious spores to act as parasites. Many protists are mixotrophic, having both phototrophic and heterotrophic characteristics. Mixotrophic protists will typically depend on one source of nutrients while using the other as a supplemental source or a temporary alternative when its primary source is unavailable.

=== Prokaryote ===
Prokaryotes, including bacteria and archaea, vary greatly in how they obtain nutrients across nutritional groups. Prokaryotes can only transport soluble compounds across their cell envelopes, but they can break down chemical components around them. Some lithotrophic prokaryotes are extremophiles that can survive in nutrient-deprived environments by breaking down inorganic matter. Phototrophic prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria and Chloroflexia, can engage in photosynthesis to obtain energy from sunlight. This is common among bacteria that form in mats atop geothermal springs. Phototrophic prokaryotes typically obtain carbon from assimilating carbon dioxide through the Calvin cycle.

Some prokaryotes, such as &quot;Bdellovibrio&quot; and &quot;Ensifer&quot;, are predatory and feed on other single-celled organisms. Predatory prokaryotes seek out other organisms through chemotaxis or random collision, merge with the organism, degrade it, and absorb the released nutrients. Predatory strategies of prokaryotes include attaching to the outer surface of the organism and degrading it externally, entering the cytoplasm of the organism, or by entering the periplasmic space of the organism. Groups of predatory prokaryotes may forgo attachment by collectively producing hydrolytic enzymes.

<doc id="21527" wikidata="Q12479" url="?curid=21527" title="Number theory">
<text>Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and arithmetic functions. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) said, &quot;Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics.&quot; Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of mathematical objects constructed from integers (for example, rational numbers), or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers).

Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (Diophantine geometry). Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of analytical objects (for example, the Riemann zeta function) that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion (analytic number theory). One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers; for example, as approximated by the latter (Diophantine approximation).

The older term for number theory is &quot;arithmetic&quot;. By the early twentieth century, it had been superseded by &quot;number theory&quot;. (The word &quot;arithmetic&quot; is used by the general public to mean elementary calculations; it has also acquired other meanings in mathematical logic, as in &quot;Peano arithmetic&quot;, and computer science, as in &quot;floating-point arithmetic&quot;.) The use of the term &quot;arithmetic&quot; for &quot;number theory&quot; regained some ground in the second half of the twentieth century, arguably in part due to French influence. In particular, &quot;arithmetical&quot; is commonly preferred as an adjective to &quot;number-theoretic&quot;.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
==== Dawn of arithmetic ====

The earliest historical find of an arithmetical nature is a fragment of a table: the broken clay tablet Plimpton 322 (Larsa, Mesopotamia, c. 1800 BC) contains a list of &quot;Pythagorean triples&quot;, that is, integers formula_1 such that formula_2.
The triples are too many and too large to have been obtained by brute force. The heading over the first column reads: &quot;The &quot;takiltum&quot; of the diagonal which has been subtracted such that the width...&quot;

The table&#x27;s layout suggests that it was constructed by means of what amounts, in modern language, to the identity

:formula_3

which is implicit in routine Old Babylonian exercises. If some other method was used, the triples were first constructed and then reordered by formula_4, presumably for actual use as a &quot;table&quot;, for example, with a view to applications.

It is not known what these applications may have been, or whether there could have been any; Babylonian astronomy, for example, truly came into its own only later. It has been suggested instead that the table was a source of numerical examples for school problems.

While evidence of Babylonian number theory is only survived by the Plimpton 322 tablet, some authors assert that Babylonian algebra was exceptionally well developed and included the foundations of modern elementary algebra. Late Neoplatonic sources state that Pythagoras learned mathematics from the Babylonians. Much earlier sources state that Thales and Pythagoras traveled and studied in Egypt.

In book nine of Euclid&#x27;s Elements, propositions 21–34 are very probably influenced by Pythagorean teachings; it is very simple material (&quot;odd times even is even&quot;, &quot;if an odd number measures [= divides] an even number, then it also measures [= divides] half of it&quot;), but it is all that is needed to prove that formula_5
is irrational. Pythagorean mystics gave great importance to the odd and the even.
The discovery that formula_5 is irrational is credited to the early Pythagoreans (pre-Theodorus). By revealing (in modern terms) that numbers could be irrational, this discovery seems to have provoked the first foundational crisis in mathematical history; its proof or its divulgation are sometimes credited to Hippasus, who was expelled or split from the Pythagorean sect. This forced a distinction between &quot;numbers&quot; (integers and the rationals—the subjects of arithmetic), on the one hand, and &quot;lengths&quot; and &quot;proportions&quot; (which may be identified with real numbers, whether rational or not), on the other hand.

The Pythagorean tradition spoke also of so-called polygonal or figurate numbers. While square numbers, cubic numbers, etc., are seen now as more natural than triangular numbers, pentagonal numbers, etc., the study of the sums of triangular and pentagonal numbers would prove fruitful in the early modern period (seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries).

The Chinese remainder theorem appears as an exercise in &quot;Sunzi Suanjing&quot; (between the third and fifth centuries). (There is one important step glossed over in Sunzi&#x27;s solution: it is the problem that was later solved by Āryabhaṭa&#x27;s Kuṭṭaka – see below.) The result was later generalized with a complete solution called &quot;Da-yan-shu&quot; () in Qin Jiushao&#x27;s 1247 &quot;Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections&quot; which was translated into English in early nineteenth century by British missionary Alexander Wylie.

There is also some numerical mysticism in Chinese mathematics, but, unlike that of the Pythagoreans, it seems to have led nowhere.

==== Classical Greece and the early Hellenistic period ====
Aside from a few fragments, the mathematics of Classical Greece is known to us either through the reports of contemporary non-mathematicians or through mathematical works from the early Hellenistic period. In the case of number theory, this means, by and large, &quot;Plato&quot; and &quot;Euclid&quot;, respectively.

While Asian mathematics influenced Greek and Hellenistic learning, it seems to be the case that Greek mathematics is also an indigenous tradition.

Eusebius, PE X, chapter 4 mentions of Pythagoras:

&quot;In fact the said Pythagoras, while busily studying the wisdom of each nation, visited Babylon, and Egypt, and all Persia, being instructed by the Magi and the priests: and in addition to these he is related to have studied under the Brahmans (these are Indian philosophers); and from some he gathered astrology, from others geometry, and arithmetic and music from others, and different things from different nations, and only from the wise men of Greece did he get nothing, wedded as they were to a poverty and dearth of wisdom: so on the contrary he himself became the author of instruction to the Greeks in the learning which he had procured from abroad.&quot;

Aristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans, and Cicero repeats this claim: (&quot;They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean&quot;).

Plato had a keen interest in mathematics, and distinguished clearly between arithmetic and calculation. (By &quot;arithmetic&quot; he meant, in part, theorising on number, rather than what &quot;arithmetic&quot; or &quot;number theory&quot; have come to mean.) It is through one of Plato&#x27;s dialogues—namely, &quot;Theaetetus&quot;—that it is known that Theodorus had proven that formula_7 are irrational. Theaetetus was, like Plato, a disciple of Theodorus&#x27;s; he worked on distinguishing different kinds of incommensurables, and was thus arguably a pioneer in the study of number systems. (Book X of Euclid&#x27;s Elements is described by Pappus as being largely based on Theaetetus&#x27;s work.)

Euclid devoted part of his &quot;Elements&quot; to prime numbers and divisibility, topics that belong unambiguously to number theory and are basic to it (Books VII to IX of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;). In particular, he gave an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers (the Euclidean algorithm; &quot;Elements&quot;, Prop. VII.2) and the first known proof of the infinitude of primes (&quot;Elements&quot;, Prop. IX.20).

In 1773, Lessing published an epigram he had found in a manuscript during his work as a librarian; it claimed to be a letter sent by Archimedes to Eratosthenes. The epigram proposed what has become known as
Archimedes&#x27;s cattle problem; its solution (absent from the manuscript) requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation (which reduces to what would later be misnamed Pell&#x27;s equation). As far as it is known, such equations were first successfully treated by the Indian school. It is not known whether Archimedes himself had a method of solution.

==== Diophantus ====
Little is known about Diophantus of Alexandria; he probably lived in the third century AD, that is, about five hundred years after Euclid. Six out of the thirteen books of Diophantus&#x27;s &#x27; survive in the original Greek and four more survive in an Arabic translation. The &#x27; is a collection of worked-out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations, usually of the form formula_8 or formula_9. In modern parlance, Diophantine equations are polynomial equations to which rational or integer solutions are sought.

==== Āryabhaṭa, Brahmagupta, Bhāskara ====
While Greek astronomy probably influenced Indian learning, to the point of introducing trigonometry, it seems to be the case that Indian mathematics is otherwise an indigenous tradition; in particular, there is no evidence that Euclid&#x27;s Elements reached India before the eighteenth century.

Āryabhaṭa (476–550 AD) showed that pairs of simultaneous congruences formula_10, formula_11 could be solved by a method he called &quot;kuṭṭaka&quot;, or &quot;pulveriser&quot;; this is a procedure close to (a generalisation of) the Euclidean algorithm, which was probably discovered independently in India. Āryabhaṭa seems to have had in mind applications to astronomical calculations.

Brahmagupta (628 AD) started the systematic study of indefinite quadratic equations—in particular, the misnamed Pell equation, in which Archimedes may have first been interested, and which did not start to be solved in the West until the time of Fermat and Euler. Later Sanskrit authors would follow, using Brahmagupta&#x27;s technical terminology. A general procedure (the chakravala, or &quot;cyclic method&quot;) for solving Pell&#x27;s equation was finally found by Jayadeva (cited in the eleventh century; his work is otherwise lost); the earliest surviving exposition appears in Bhāskara II&#x27;s Bīja-gaṇita (twelfth century).

Indian mathematics remained largely unknown in Europe until the late eighteenth century; Brahmagupta and Bhāskara&#x27;s work was translated into English in 1817 by Henry Colebrooke.

==== Arithmetic in the Islamic golden age ====


In the early ninth century, the caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun ordered translations of many Greek mathematical works and at least one Sanskrit work (the &quot;Sindhind&quot;, which may or may not be Brahmagupta&#x27;s Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta).
Diophantus&#x27;s main work, the &quot;Arithmetica&quot;, was translated into Arabic by Qusta ibn Luqa (820–912).
Part of the treatise &quot;al-Fakhri&quot; (by al-Karajī, 953 – c. 1029) builds on it to some extent. According to Rashed Roshdi, Al-Karajī&#x27;s contemporary Ibn al-Haytham knew what would later be called Wilson&#x27;s theorem.

==== Western Europe in the Middle Ages ====
Other than a treatise on squares in arithmetic progression by Fibonacci—who traveled and studied in north Africa and Constantinople—no number theory to speak of was done in western Europe during the Middle Ages. Matters started to change in Europe in the late Renaissance, thanks to a renewed study of the works of Greek antiquity. A catalyst was the textual emendation and translation into Latin of Diophantus&#x27; &quot;Arithmetica&quot;.
=== Early modern number theory ===
==== Fermat ====
Pierre de Fermat (1607–1665) never published his writings; in particular, his work on number theory is contained almost entirely in letters to mathematicians and in private marginal notes. In his notes and letters, he scarcely wrote any proofs—he had no models in the area.

Over his lifetime, Fermat made the following contributions to the field:
* One of Fermat&#x27;s first interests was perfect numbers (which appear in Euclid, &quot;Elements&quot; IX) and amicable numbers; these topics led him to work on integer divisors, which were from the beginning among the subjects of the correspondence (1636 onwards) that put him in touch with the mathematical community of the day.
* In 1638, Fermat claimed, without proof, that all whole numbers can be expressed as the sum of four squares or fewer.
* Fermat&#x27;s little theorem (1640): if &quot;a&quot; is not divisible by a prime &quot;p&quot;, then formula_12
* If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are coprime, then formula_13 is not divisible by any prime congruent to −1 modulo 4; and every prime congruent to 1 modulo 4 can be written in the form formula_13. These two statements also date from 1640; in 1659, Fermat stated to Huygens that he had proven the latter statement by the method of infinite descent.
* In 1657, Fermat posed the problem of solving formula_15 as a challenge to English mathematicians. The problem was solved in a few months by Wallis and Brouncker. Fermat considered their solution valid, but pointed out they had provided an algorithm without a proof (as had Jayadeva and Bhaskara, though Fermat was not aware of this). He stated that a proof could be found by infinite descent.
* Fermat stated and proved (by infinite descent) in the appendix to &quot;Observations on Diophantus&quot; (Obs. XLV) that formula_16 has no non-trivial solutions in the integers. Fermat also mentioned to his correspondents that formula_17 has no non-trivial solutions, and that this could also be proven by infinite descent. The first known proof is due to Euler (1753; indeed by infinite descent).
* Fermat claimed (Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem) to have shown there are no solutions to formula_18 for all formula_19; this claim appears in his annotations in the margins of his copy of Diophantus.

==== Euler ====
The interest of Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) in number theory was first spurred in 1729, when a friend of his, the amateur Goldbach, pointed him towards some of Fermat&#x27;s work on the subject. This has been called the &quot;rebirth&quot; of modern number theory, after Fermat&#x27;s relative lack of success in getting his contemporaries&#x27; attention for the subject. Euler&#x27;s work on number theory includes the following:
* &quot;Proofs for Fermat&#x27;s statements.&quot; This includes Fermat&#x27;s little theorem (generalised by Euler to non-prime moduli); the fact that formula_20 if and only if formula_21; initial work towards a proof that every integer is the sum of four squares (the first complete proof is by Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1770), soon improved by Euler himself); the lack of non-zero integer solutions to formula_22 (implying the case &quot;n=4&quot; of Fermat&#x27;s last theorem, the case &quot;n=3&quot; of which Euler also proved by a related method).
* &quot;Pell&#x27;s equation&quot;, first misnamed by Euler. He wrote on the link between continued fractions and Pell&#x27;s equation.
* &quot;First steps towards analytic number theory.&quot; In his work of sums of four squares, partitions, pentagonal numbers, and the distribution of prime numbers, Euler pioneered the use of what can be seen as analysis (in particular, infinite series) in number theory. Since he lived before the development of complex analysis, most of his work is restricted to the formal manipulation of power series. He did, however, do some very notable (though not fully rigorous) early work on what would later be called the Riemann zeta function.
* &quot;Quadratic forms&quot;. Following Fermat&#x27;s lead, Euler did further research on the question of which primes can be expressed in the form formula_23, some of it prefiguring quadratic reciprocity.
* &quot;Diophantine equations&quot;. Euler worked on some Diophantine equations of genus 0 and 1. In particular, he studied Diophantus&#x27;s work; he tried to systematise it, but the time was not yet ripe for such an endeavour—algebraic geometry was still in its infancy. He did notice there was a connection between Diophantine problems and elliptic integrals, whose study he had himself initiated.
==== Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss ====
Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813) was the first to give full proofs of some of Fermat&#x27;s and Euler&#x27;s work and observations—for instance, the four-square theorem and the basic theory of the misnamed &quot;Pell&#x27;s equation&quot; (for which an algorithmic solution was found by Fermat and his contemporaries, and also by Jayadeva and Bhaskara II before them.) He also studied quadratic forms in full generality (as opposed to formula_24)—defining their equivalence relation, showing how to put them in reduced form, etc.

Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752–1833) was the first to state the law of quadratic reciprocity. He also conjectured what amounts to the prime number theorem and Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions. He gave a full treatment of the equation formula_25 and worked on quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully by Gauss. In his old age, he was the first to prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for formula_26 (completing work by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, and crediting both him and Sophie Germain).

In his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; (1798), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) proved the law of quadratic reciprocity and developed the theory of quadratic forms (in particular, defining their composition). He also introduced some basic notation (congruences) and devoted a section to computational matters, including primality tests. The last section of the &quot;Disquisitiones&quot; established a link between roots of unity and number theory:
The theory of the division of the circle...which is treated in sec. 7 does not belong by itself to arithmetic, but its principles can only be drawn from higher arithmetic.

In this way, Gauss arguably made a first foray towards both Évariste Galois&#x27;s work and algebraic number theory.

=== Maturity and division into subfields ===

Starting early in the nineteenth century, the following developments gradually took place:
* The rise to self-consciousness of number theory (or &quot;higher arithmetic&quot;) as a field of study.
* The development of much of modern mathematics necessary for basic modern number theory: complex analysis, group theory, Galois theory—accompanied by greater rigor in analysis and abstraction in algebra.
* The rough subdivision of number theory into its modern subfields—in particular, analytic and algebraic number theory.

Algebraic number theory may be said to start with the study of reciprocity and cyclotomy, but truly came into its own with the development of abstract algebra and early ideal theory and valuation theory; see below. A conventional starting point for analytic number theory is Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions (1837), whose proof introduced L-functions and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable. The first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually goes back to Euler (1730s), who used formal power series and non-rigorous (or implicit) limiting arguments. The use of &quot;complex&quot; analysis in number theory comes later: the work of Bernhard Riemann (1859) on the zeta function is the canonical starting point; Jacobi&#x27;s four-square theorem (1839), which predates it, belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory (modular forms).

The history of each subfield is briefly addressed in its own section below; see the main article of each subfield for fuller treatments. Many of the most interesting questions in each area remain open and are being actively worked on.

== Main subdivisions ==
=== Elementary number theory ===
The term &quot;elementary&quot; generally denotes a method that does not use complex analysis. For example, the prime number theorem was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by Erdős and Selberg. The term is somewhat ambiguous: for example, proofs based on complex Tauberian theorems (for example, Wiener–Ikehara) are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary, in spite of using Fourier analysis, rather than complex analysis as such. Here as elsewhere, an &quot;elementary&quot; proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a non-elementary one.

Number theory has the reputation of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson. At the same time, the proofs of these results are not particularly accessible, in part because the range of tools they use is, if anything, unusually broad within mathematics.

=== Analytic number theory ===

&quot;Analytic number theory&quot; may be defined
* in terms of its tools, as the study of the integers by means of tools from real and complex analysis; or
* in terms of its concerns, as the study within number theory of estimates on size and density, as opposed to identities.

Some subjects generally considered to be part of analytic number theory, for example, sieve theory, are better covered by the second rather than the first definition: some of sieve theory, for instance, uses little analysis, yet it does belong to analytic number theory.

The following are examples of problems in analytic number theory: the prime number theorem, the Goldbach conjecture (or the twin prime conjecture, or the Hardy–Littlewood conjectures), the Waring problem and the Riemann hypothesis. Some of the most important tools of analytic number theory are the circle method, sieve methods and L-functions (or, rather, the study of their properties). The theory of modular forms (and, more generally, automorphic forms) also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory.

One may ask analytic questions about algebraic numbers, and use analytic means to answer such questions; it is thus that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define prime ideals (generalizations of prime numbers in the field of algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This question can be answered by means of an examination of Dedekind zeta functions, which are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function, a key analytic object at the roots of the subject. This is an example of a general procedure in analytic number theory: deriving information about the distribution of a sequence (here, prime ideals or prime numbers) from the analytic behavior of an appropriately constructed complex-valued function.

=== Algebraic number theory ===
An &quot;algebraic number&quot; is any complex number that is a solution to some polynomial equation formula_27 with rational coefficients; for example, every solution formula_28 of formula_29 (say) is an algebraic number. Fields of algebraic numbers are also called &quot;algebraic number fields&quot;, or shortly &quot;number fields&quot;. Algebraic number theory studies algebraic number fields. Thus, analytic and algebraic number theory can and do overlap: the former is defined by its methods, the latter by its objects of study.

It could be argued that the simplest kind of number fields (viz., quadratic fields) were already studied by Gauss, as the discussion of quadratic forms in &quot;Disquisitiones arithmeticae&quot; can be restated in terms of ideals and
norms in quadratic fields. (A &quot;quadratic field&quot; consists of all
numbers of the form formula_30, where
formula_31 and formula_32 are rational numbers and formula_33
is a fixed rational number whose square root is not rational.)
For that matter, the eleventh-century chakravala method amounts—in modern terms—to an algorithm for finding the units of a real quadratic number field. However, neither Bhāskara nor Gauss knew of number fields as such.

The grounds of the subject were set in the late nineteenth century, when &quot;ideal numbers&quot;, the &quot;theory of ideals&quot; and &quot;valuation theory&quot; were introduced; these are three complementary ways of dealing with the lack of unique factorisation in algebraic number fields. (For example, in the field generated by the rationals
and formula_34, the number formula_35 can be factorised both as formula_36 and
formula_37; all of formula_38, formula_39, formula_40 and
formula_41
are irreducible, and thus, in a naïve sense, analogous to primes among the integers.) The initial impetus for the development of ideal numbers (by Kummer) seems to have come from the study of higher reciprocity laws, that is, generalisations of quadratic reciprocity.

Number fields are often studied as extensions of smaller number fields: a field &quot;L&quot; is said to be an &quot;extension&quot; of a field &quot;K&quot; if &quot;L&quot; contains &quot;K&quot;.
(For example, the complex numbers &quot;C&quot; are an extension of the reals &quot;R&quot;, and the reals &quot;R&quot; are an extension of the rationals &quot;Q&quot;.)
Classifying the possible extensions of a given number field is a difficult and partially open problem. Abelian extensions—that is, extensions &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot; such that the Galois group Gal(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;) of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot; is an abelian group—are relatively well understood.
Their classification was the object of the programme of class field theory, which was initiated in the late nineteenth century (partly by Kronecker and Eisenstein) and carried out largely in 1900–1950.

An example of an active area of research in algebraic number theory is Iwasawa theory. The Langlands program, one of the main current large-scale research plans in mathematics, is sometimes described as an attempt to generalise class field theory to non-abelian extensions of number fields.

=== Diophantine geometry ===
The central problem of &quot;Diophantine geometry&quot; is to determine when a Diophantine equation has solutions, and if it does, how many. The approach taken is to think of the solutions of an equation as a geometric object.

For example, an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane. More generally, an equation or system of equations in two or more variables defines a curve, a surface, or some other such object in -dimensional space. In Diophantine geometry, one asks whether there are any &quot;rational points&quot; (points all of whose coordinates are rationals) or
&quot;integral points&quot; (points all of whose coordinates are integers) on the curve or surface. If there are any such points, the next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed. A basic question in this direction is whether there are finitely
or infinitely many rational points on a given curve or surface.

An example here may be helpful. Consider the Pythagorean equation formula_42
one would like to know its rational solutions; that is, its solutions
formula_43 such that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are both rational. This is the same as asking for all integer solutions
to formula_44; any solution to the latter equation gives us a solution formula_45, formula_46 to the former. It is also the
same as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve described by formula_47 (a circle of radius 1 centered on the origin).

The rephrasing of questions on equations in terms of points on curves is felicitous. The finiteness or not of the number of rational or integer points on an algebraic curve (that is, rational or integer solutions to an equation formula_48, where formula_49 is a polynomial in two variables) depends crucially on the genus of the curve. A major achievement of this approach is Wiles&#x27;s proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, for which other geometrical notions are just as crucial.

There is also the closely linked area of Diophantine approximations: given a number formula_28, determine how well it can be approximated by rational numbers. One seeks approximations that are good relative to the amount of space required to write the rational number: call formula_51 (with formula_52) a good approximation to formula_28 if formula_54, where formula_55 is large. This question is of special interest if formula_28 is an algebraic number. If formula_28 cannot be approximated well, then some equations do not have integer or rational solutions. Moreover, several concepts (especially that of height) are critical both in Diophantine geometry and in the study of Diophantine approximations. This question is also of special interest in transcendental number theory: if a number can be approximated better than any algebraic number, then it is a transcendental number. It is by this argument that  and e have been shown to be transcendental.

Diophantine geometry should not be confused with the geometry of numbers, which is a collection of graphical methods for answering certain questions in algebraic number theory. &quot;Arithmetic geometry&quot;, however, is a contemporary term for much the same domain as that covered by the term &quot;Diophantine geometry&quot;. The term &quot;arithmetic geometry&quot; is arguably used most often when one wishes to emphasize the connections to modern algebraic geometry (for example, in Faltings&#x27;s theorem) rather than to techniques in Diophantine approximations.

== Other subfields ==
The areas below date from no earlier than the mid-twentieth century, even if they are based on older material. For example, as explained below, algorithms in number theory have a long history, arguably predating the formal concept of proof. However, the modern study of computability began only in the 1930s and 1940s, while computational complexity theory emerged in the 1970s.

=== Probabilistic number theory ===
Probabilistic number theory starts with questions such as the following ones: Take an integer at random between one and a million. How likely is it to be prime? (this is just another way of asking how many primes there are between one and a million). How many prime divisors will have on average? What is the probability that it will have many more or many fewer divisors or prime divisors than the average?

Much of probabilistic number theory can be seen as an important special case of the study of variables that are almost, but not quite, mutually independent. For example, the event that a random integer between one and a million be divisible by two and the event that it be divisible by three are almost independent, but not quite.

It is sometimes said that probabilistic combinatorics uses the fact that whatever happens with probability greater than formula_58 must happen sometimes; one may say with equal justice that many applications of probabilistic number theory hinge on the fact that whatever is unusual must be rare. If certain algebraic objects (say, rational or integer solutions to certain equations) can be shown to be in the tail of certain sensibly defined distributions, it follows that there must be few of them; this is a very concrete non-probabilistic statement following from a probabilistic one.

At times, a non-rigorous, probabilistic approach leads to a number of heuristic algorithms and open problems, notably Cramér&#x27;s conjecture.

=== Arithmetic combinatorics ===
Arithmetic combinatorics starts with questions like the following ones: Does a fairly &quot;thick&quot; infinite set formula_59 contain many elements in arithmetic progression: formula_31,
formula_61, say? Should it be possible to write large integers as sums of elements of formula_59?

These questions are characteristic of &quot;arithmetic combinatorics&quot;. This is a presently coalescing field; it subsumes &quot;additive number theory&quot; (which concerns itself with certain very specific sets formula_59 of arithmetic significance, such as the primes or the squares) and, arguably, some of the &quot;geometry of numbers&quot;, together with some rapidly developing new material. Its focus on issues of growth and distribution accounts in part for its developing links with ergodic theory, finite group theory, model theory, and other fields. The term &quot;additive combinatorics&quot; is also used; however, the sets formula_59 being studied need not be sets of integers, but rather subsets of non-commutative groups, for which the multiplication symbol, not the addition symbol, is traditionally used; they can also be subsets of rings, in which case the growth of formula_65 and formula_59·formula_59 may be compared.

=== Computational number theory ===
While the word &quot;algorithm&quot; goes back only to certain readers of al-Khwārizmī, careful descriptions of methods of solution are older than proofs: such methods (that is, algorithms) are as old as any recognisable mathematics—ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Vedic, Chinese—whereas proofs appeared only with the Greeks of the classical period.
An early case is that of what is now called the Euclidean algorithm. In its basic form (namely, as an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor) it appears as Proposition 2 of Book VII in &quot;Elements&quot;, together with a proof of correctness. However, in the form that is often used in number theory (namely, as an algorithm for finding integer solutions to an equation formula_68, or, what is the same, for finding the quantities whose existence is assured by the Chinese remainder theorem) it first appears in the works of Āryabhaṭa (fifth to sixth centuries) as an algorithm called &quot;kuṭṭaka&quot; (&quot;pulveriser&quot;), without a proof of correctness.

There are two main questions: &quot;Can this be computed?&quot; and &quot;Can it be computed rapidly?&quot; Anyone can test whether a number is prime or, if it is not, split it into prime factors; doing so rapidly is another matter. Fast algorithms for testing primality are now known, but, in spite of much work (both theoretical and practical), no truly fast algorithm for factoring.

The difficulty of a computation can be useful: modern protocols for encrypting messages (for example, RSA) depend on functions that are known to all, but whose inverses are known only to a chosen few, and would take one too long a time to figure out on one&#x27;s own. For example, these functions can be such that their inverses can be computed only if certain large integers are factorized. While many difficult computational problems outside number theory are known, most working encryption protocols nowadays are based on the difficulty of a few number-theoretical problems.

Some things may not be computable at all; in fact, this can be proven in some instances. For instance, in 1970, it was proven, as a solution to Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem, that there is no Turing machine which can solve all Diophantine equations. In particular, this means that, given a computably enumerable set of axioms, there are Diophantine equations for which there is no proof, starting from the axioms, of whether the set of equations has or does not have integer solutions. (i.e., Diophantine equations for which there are no integer solutions, since, given a Diophantine equation with at least one solution, the solution itself provides a proof of the fact that a solution exists. It cannot be proven that a particular Diophantine equation is of this kind, since this would imply that it has no solutions.)

== Applications ==
The number-theorist Leonard Dickson (1874–1954) said &quot;Thank God that number theory is unsullied by any application&quot;. Such a view is no longer applicable to number theory. In 1974, Donald Knuth said &quot;virtually every theorem in elementary number theory arises in a natural, motivated way in connection with the problem of making computers do high-speed numerical calculations&quot;.
Elementary number theory is taught in discrete mathematics courses for computer scientists. It also has applications to the continuous in numerical analysis.

Number theory has now several modern applications spanning diverse areas such as:
* Cryptography: Public-key encryption schemes such as RSA are based on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors.
* Computer science: The fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, which is used to efficiently compute the discrete Fourier transform, has important applications in signal processing and data analysis.
* Physics: The Riemann hypothesis has connections to the distribution of prime numbers and has been studied for its potential implications in physics.
* Error correction codes: The theory of finite fields and algebraic geometry have been used to construct efficient error-correcting codes.
* Communications: The design of cellular telephone networks requires knowledge of the theory of modular forms, which is a part of analytic number theory.
* Study of musical scales: the concept of &quot;equal temperament&quot;, which is the basis for most modern Western music, involves dividing the octave into 12 equal parts. This has been studied using number theory and in particular the properties of the 12th root of 2.

== Prizes ==
The American Mathematical Society awards the &quot;Cole Prize in Number Theory&quot;. Moreover, number theory is one of the three mathematical subdisciplines rewarded by the &quot;Fermat Prize&quot;.

== Further reading ==
Two of the most popular introductions to the subject are:
* 

Hardy and Wright&#x27;s book is a comprehensive classic, though its clarity sometimes suffers due to the authors&#x27; insistence on elementary methods (Apostol 1981).
Vinogradov&#x27;s main attraction consists in its set of problems, which quickly lead to Vinogradov&#x27;s own research interests; the text itself is very basic and close to minimal. Other popular first introductions are:

<text>Nitroglycerin (NG) (alternative spelling nitroglycerine), also known as trinitroglycerol (TNG), nitro, glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), or 1,2,3-trinitroxypropane, is a dense, colorless or pale yellow, oily, explosive liquid most commonly produced by nitrating glycerol with white fuming nitric acid under conditions appropriate to the formation of the nitric acid ester. Chemically, the substance is a nitrate ester rather than a nitro compound, but the traditional name is retained. Discovered in 1846 by Ascanio Sobrero, nitroglycerin has been used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives, namely dynamite, and as such it is employed in the construction, demolition, and mining industries. It is combined with nitrocellulose to form double-based smokeless powder, used as a propellant in artillery and firearms since the 1880s. 

As is the case for many other explosives, nitroglycerin becomes more and more prone to exploding (i.e. spontaneous decomposition) as the temperature is increased. Upon exposure to heat above 218 °C at sea-level atmospheric pressure, nitroglycerin becomes extremely unstable and tends to explode. When placed in vacuum, it has an autoignition temperature of 270 °C instead. With a melting point of 12.8 °C, the chemical is almost always encountered as a thick and viscous fluid, changing to a crystalline solid when frozen. Although the pure compound itself is colorless, in practice the presence of nitric oxide impurities left over during production tends to give it a slight yellowish tint. 

Due to its high boiling point and consequently low vapor pressure (0.00026 mmHg at 20 °C), pure nitroglycerin has practically no odor at room temperature, with a sweet and burning taste when ingested. Unintentional detonation may ensue when dropped, shaken, lit on fire, rapidly heated, exposed to sunlight and ozone, subjected to sparks and electrical discharges, or roughly handled. Its sensitivity to exploding is responsible for numerous devastating industrial accidents throughout its history. The chemical&#x27;s characteristic reactivity may be reduced through the addition of desensitizing agents, which makes it less likely to explode. Clay (diatomaceous earth) is an example of such an agent, forming dynamite, a much more easily handled composition. Addition of other desensitizing agents give birth to the various formulations of dynamite. 

Nitroglycerin has been used for over 130 years in medicine as a potent vasodilator (causing dilation of the vascular system) to treat heart conditions, such as angina pectoris and chronic heart failure. Though it was previously known that these beneficial effects are due to nitroglycerin being converted to nitric oxide, a potent venodilator, the enzyme for this conversion was only discovered to be mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) in 2002. Nitroglycerin is available in sublingual tablets, sprays, ointments, and patches.

== History ==
Nitroglycerin was the first practical explosive produced that was stronger than black powder. It was synthesized by the Italian chemist Ascanio Sobrero in 1846, working under Théophile-Jules Pelouze at the University of Turin. Sobrero initially called his discovery &quot;pyroglycerine&quot; and warned vigorously against its use as an explosive.

Nitroglycerin was adopted as a commercially useful explosive by Alfred Nobel, who experimented with safer ways to handle the dangerous compound after his younger brother, Emil Oskar Nobel, and several factory workers were killed in an explosion at the Nobels&#x27; armaments factory in 1864 in Heleneborg, Sweden.

One year later, Nobel founded Alfred Nobel and Company in Germany and built an isolated factory in the Krümmel hills of Geesthacht near Hamburg. This business exported a liquid combination of nitroglycerin and gunpowder called &quot;Blasting Oil&quot;, but this was extremely unstable and difficult to handle, as evidenced in numerous catastrophes. The buildings of the Krümmel factory were destroyed twice.

In April 1866, several crates of nitroglycerin were shipped to California, three of which were destined for the Central Pacific Railroad, which planned to experiment with it as a blasting explosive to expedite the construction of the Summit Tunnel through the Sierra Nevada Mountains. One of the remaining crates exploded, destroying a Wells Fargo company office in San Francisco and killing 15 people. This led to a complete ban on the transportation of liquid nitroglycerin in California. The on-site manufacture of nitroglycerin was thus required for the remaining hard-rock drilling and blasting required for the completion of the First transcontinental railroad in North America.

On Christmas Day 1867, an attempt to dispose of nine canisters of Blasting Oil that had been illegally stored at the White Swan Inn in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne resulted in an explosion on the Town Moor that killed eight people. In June 1869, two one-ton wagons loaded with nitroglycerin, then known locally as Powder-Oil, exploded in the road at the North Wales village of Cwm-y-glo. The explosion led to the loss of six lives, many injuries and much damage to the village. Little trace was found of the two horses. The UK Government was so alarmed at the damage caused and what could have happened in a city location (these two tons were part of a larger load coming from Germany via Liverpool) that they soon passed the Nitro-Glycerine Act of 1869. Liquid nitroglycerin was widely banned elsewhere, as well, and these legal restrictions led to Alfred Nobel and his company&#x27;s developing dynamite in 1867. This was made by mixing nitroglycerin with diatomaceous earth (&quot;&quot;Kieselguhr&quot; in German) found in the Krümmel hills. Similar mixtures, such as &quot;dualine&quot; (1867), &quot;lithofracteur&quot; (1869), and &quot;gelignite&quot; (1875), were formed by mixing nitroglycerin with other inert absorbents, and many combinations were tried by other companies in attempts to get around Nobel&#x27;s tightly held patents for dynamite.

Dynamite mixtures containing nitrocellulose, which increases the viscosity of the mix, are commonly known as &quot;gelatins&quot;.

Following the discovery that amyl nitrite helped alleviate chest pain, the physician William Murrell experimented with the use of nitroglycerin to alleviate angina pectoris and to reduce the blood pressure. He began treating his patients with small diluted doses of nitroglycerin in 1878, and this treatment was soon adopted into widespread use after Murrell published his results in the journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1879. A few months before his death in 1896, Alfred Nobel was prescribed nitroglycerin for this heart condition, writing to a friend: &quot;Isn&#x27;t it the irony of fate that I have been prescribed nitro-glycerin, to be taken internally! They call it Trinitrin, so as not to scare the chemist and the public.&quot; The medical establishment also used the name &quot;glyceryl trinitrate&quot; for the same reason.

=== Wartime production rates ===
Large quantities of nitroglycerin were manufactured during World War I and World War II for use as military propellants and in military engineering work. During World War I, HM Factory, Gretna, the largest propellant factory in the United Kingdom, produced about 800 tonnes of cordite RDB per week. This amount required at least 336 tonnes of nitroglycerin per week (assuming no losses in production). The Royal Navy had its own factory at the Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath, in Dorset, England. A large cordite factory was also built in Canada during World War I. The Canadian Explosives Limited cordite factory at Nobel, Ontario, was designed to produce of cordite per month, requiring about 286 tonnes of nitroglycerin per month.

== Instability and desensitization ==
In its undiluted form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive, with physical shock causing it to explode. If it has not been adequately purified during manufacture it can degrade over time to even more unstable forms. This makes nitroglycerin highly dangerous to transport or use. In its undiluted form, it is one of the world&#x27;s most powerful explosives, comparable to the more recently developed RDX and PETN.

Early in its history, liquid nitroglycerin was found to be &quot;desensitized&quot; by freezing it at a temperature below depending on its purity. Its sensitivity to shock while frozen is somewhat unpredictable: &quot;It is more insensitive to the shock from a fulminate cap or a rifle ball when in that condition but on the other hand it appears to be more liable to explode on breaking, crushing, tamping, etc.&quot; Frozen nitroglycerin is much less energetic than liquid, and so must be thawed before use. Thawing it out can be extremely sensitizing, especially if impurities are present or the warming is too rapid. Ethylene glycol dinitrate or another polynitrate may be added to lower the melting point and thereby avoid the necessity of thawing frozen explosive.

Chemically &quot;desensitizing&quot; nitroglycerin is possible to a point where it can be considered about as &quot;safe&quot; as modern high explosives, such as by the addition of ethanol, acetone, or dinitrotoluene. The nitroglycerin may have to be extracted from the desensitizer chemical to restore its effectiveness before use, for example by adding water to draw off ethanol used as a desensitizer.

== Detonation ==
When nitroglycerin explodes, the products after cooling are given by:
:2 → 6 + 5 + 3 + 

The heat released can be calculated from the heats of formation. Using −371 kJ/mol for the heat of formation of condensed phase nitroglycerin gives 1414 kJ/mol released if forming water vapor, and 1524 if forming liquid water.

The detonation velocity of nitroglycerin is 7820 meters per second, which is about 113% the speed of TNT. Accordingly, nitroglycerin is considered to be a high-brisance explosive, which is to say, it has excellent shattering ability. The heat liberated during detonation raises the temperature of the gaseous byproducts to about . With a standard enthalpy of explosive decomposition of −1414 kJ/mol and a molecular weight of 227.0865 g/mol, nitroglycerin has a specific explosive energy density of 1.488 kilocalories per gram, or 6.23 kJ/g, making nitroglycerin 49% more energetic on a mass basis than the standard definitional value assigned to TNT (precisely 1 kcal/g).

== Manufacturing ==

Nitroglycerin can be produced by acid-catalyzed nitration of glycerol (glycerin).

The industrial manufacturing process often reacts glycerol with a nearly 1:1 mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid. This can be produced by mixing white fuming nitric acid—a quite expensive pure nitric acid in which the oxides of nitrogen have been removed, as opposed to red fuming nitric acid, which contains nitrogen oxides—and concentrated sulfuric acid. More often, this mixture is attained by the cheaper method of mixing fuming sulfuric acid, also known as oleum—sulfuric acid containing excess sulfur trioxide—and azeotropic nitric acid (consisting of about 70% nitric acid, with the rest being water).

The sulfuric acid produces protonated nitric acid species, which are attacked by glycerol&#x27;s nucleophilic oxygen atoms. The nitro group is thus added as an ester C−O−NO2 and water is produced. This is different from an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction in which nitronium ions are the electrophile.

The addition of glycerol results in an exothermic reaction (i.e., heat is produced), as usual for mixed-acid nitrations. If the mixture becomes too hot, it results in a runaway reaction, a state of accelerated nitration accompanied by the destructive oxidation of organic materials by the hot nitric acid and the release of poisonous nitrogen dioxide gas at high risk of an explosion. Thus, the glycerin mixture is added slowly to the reaction vessel containing the mixed acid (not acid to glycerin). The nitrator is cooled with cold water or some other coolant mixture and maintained throughout the glycerin addition at about , hot enough for esterification to occur at a fast rate but cold enough to avoid runaway reaction. The nitrator vessel, often constructed of iron or lead and generally stirred with compressed air, has an emergency trap door at its base, which hangs over a large pool of very cold water and into which the whole reaction mixture (called the charge) can be dumped to prevent an explosion, a process referred to as drowning. If the temperature of the charge exceeds about (actual value varying by country) or brown fumes are seen in the nitrator&#x27;s vent, then it is immediately drowned.

== Use as an explosive and a propellant ==

Nitroglycerin is an oily liquid that explodes when subjected to heat, shock, or flame. The main use of nitroglycerin, by tonnage, is in explosives such as dynamite and in propellants as an ingredient. However, its sensitivity has limited the usefulness of nitroglycerin as a military explosive; less sensitive explosives such as TNT, RDX, and HMX have largely replaced it in munitions.

Alfred Nobel developed the use of nitroglycerin as a blasting explosive by mixing nitroglycerin with inert absorbents, particularly &quot;Kieselgur&quot;, or diatomaceous earth. He named this explosive dynamite and patented it in 1867. It was supplied ready for use in the form of sticks, individually wrapped in greased waterproof paper. Dynamite and similar explosives were widely adopted for civil engineering tasks, such as in drilling highway and railroad tunnels, for mining, for clearing farmland of stumps, in quarrying, and in demolition work. Likewise, military engineers have used dynamite for construction and demolition work.

Nitroglycerin has been used in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing, a process used to recover oil and gas from shale formations. The technique involves displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in natural or hydraulically induced fracture systems, or displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in hydraulically induced fractures followed by wellbore shots using pelletized TNT.

Nitroglycerin has an advantage over some other high explosives that on detonation it produces practically no visible smoke. Therefore, it is useful as an ingredient in the formulation of various kinds of smokeless powder.

Alfred Nobel then developed ballistite, by combining nitroglycerin and guncotton. He patented it in 1887. Ballistite was adopted by a number of European governments, as a military propellant. Italy was the first to adopt it. The British government and the Commonwealth governments adopted cordite instead, which had been developed by Sir Frederick Abel and Sir James Dewar of the United Kingdom in 1889. The original Cordite Mk I consisted of 58% nitroglycerin, 37% guncotton, and 5.0% petroleum jelly. Ballistite and cordite were both manufactured in the form of &quot;cords&quot;.

Smokeless powders were originally developed using nitrocellulose as the sole explosive ingredient. Therefore, they were known as single-base propellants. A range of smokeless powders that contains both nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, known as double-base propellants, were also developed. Smokeless powders were originally supplied only for military use, but they were also soon developed for civilian use and were quickly adopted for sports. Some are known as sporting powders. Triple-base propellants contain nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, and nitroguanidine, but are reserved mainly for extremely high-caliber ammunition rounds such as those used in tank cannons and naval artillery. Blasting gelatin, also known as gelignite, was invented by Nobel in 1875, using nitroglycerin, wood pulp, and sodium or potassium nitrate. This was an early, low-cost, flexible explosive.

== Medical use ==

Nitroglycerin belongs to a group of drugs called nitrates, which includes many other nitrates like isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil) and isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur, Ismo, Monoket). These agents all exert their effect by being converted to nitric oxide in the body by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), and nitric oxide is a potent natural vasodilator.

In medicine, nitroglycerin is probably most commonly prescribed for angina pectoris, a painful symptom of ischemic heart disease caused by inadequate flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and as a potent antihypertensive agent. Nitroglycerin corrects the imbalance between the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart and the heart&#x27;s energy demand. There are many formulations on the market at different doses. At low doses, nitroglycerin dilates veins more than arteries, thereby reducing preload (volume of blood in the heart after filling); this is thought to be its primary mechanism of action. By decreasing preload, the heart has less blood to pump, which decreases oxygen requirement since the heart does not have to work as hard. Additionally, having a smaller preload reduces the ventricular transmural pressure (pressure exerted on the walls of the heart), which decreases the compression of heart arteries to allow more blood to flow through the heart. At higher doses, it also dilates arteries, thereby reducing afterload (decreasing the pressure against which the heart must pump). An improved ratio of myocardial oxygen demand to supply leads to the following therapeutic effects during episodes of angina pectoris: subsiding of chest pain, decrease of blood pressure, increase of heart rate, and orthostatic hypotension. Patients experiencing angina when doing certain physical activities can often prevent symptoms by taking nitroglycerin 5 to 10 minutes before the activity. Overdoses may generate methemoglobinemia.

Nitroglycerin is available in tablets, ointment, solution for intravenous use, transdermal patches, or sprays administered sublingually. Some forms of nitroglycerin last much longer in the body than others. Nitroglycerin as well as the onset and duration of action of each form is different. The sublingual or tablet spray of nitroglycerin has a two minute onset and twenty five minute duration of action. The oral formulation of nitroglycerin has a thirty five minute onset and a duration of action of 4–8 hours. The transdermal patch has an onset of thirty minutes and a duration of action of ten to twelve hours. Continuous exposure to nitrates has been shown to cause the body to stop responding normally to this medicine. Experts recommend that the patches be removed at night, allowing the body a few hours to restore its responsiveness to nitrates. Shorter-acting preparations of nitroglycerin can be used several times a day with less risk of developing tolerance. Nitroglycerin was first used by William Murrell to treat angina attacks in 1878, with the discovery published that same year.

== Industrial exposure ==
Infrequent exposure to high doses of nitroglycerin can cause severe headaches known as &quot;NG head&quot; or &quot;bang head&quot;. These headaches can be severe enough to incapacitate some people; however, humans develop a tolerance to and dependence on nitroglycerin after long-term exposure. Although rare, withdrawal can be fatal;symptoms include chest pain and other heart problems. These symptoms may be relieved with re-exposure to nitroglycerin or other suitable organic nitrates.

For workers in nitroglycerin (NTG) manufacturing facilities, the effects of withdrawal sometimes include &quot;Sunday heart attacks&quot; in those experiencing regular nitroglycerin exposure in the workplace, leading to the development of tolerance for the venodilating effects. Over the weekend, the workers lose the tolerance, and when they are re-exposed on Monday, the drastic vasodilation produces a fast heart rate, dizziness, and a headache. This is referred to as &quot;Monday disease.&quot;

People can be exposed to nitroglycerin in the workplace by breathing it in, skin absorption, swallowing it, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for nitroglycerin exposure in the workplace as 0.2 ppm (2 mg/m3) skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit of 0.1 mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 75 mg/m3, nitroglycerin is immediately dangerous to life and health.

<text>A navy, naval force, military maritime fleet, war navy, or maritime force is the branch of a nation&#x27;s armed forces principally designated for naval and amphibious warfare; namely, lake-borne, riverine, littoral, or ocean-borne combat operations and related functions. It includes anything conducted by surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne aviation, as well as ancillary support, communications, training, and other fields.

The strategic offensive role of a navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country&#x27;s shores (for example, to protect sea-lanes, deter or confront piracy, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or shore installations). The strategic defensive purpose of a navy is to frustrate seaborne projection-of-force by enemies. The strategic task of a navy also may incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Naval operations can be broadly divided between riverine and littoral applications (brown-water navy), open-ocean applications (blue-water navy), and something in between (green-water navy), although these distinctions are more about strategic scope than tactical or operational division.

== Etymology and meanings ==

First attested in English in the early 14th century, the word &quot;navy&quot; came via Old French &quot;navie&quot;, &quot;fleet of ships&quot;, from the Latin &quot;navigium&quot;, &quot;a vessel, a ship, bark, boat&quot;, from &quot;navis&quot;, &quot;ship&quot;. The word &quot;naval&quot; came from Latin &quot;navalis&quot;, &quot;pertaining to ship&quot;; cf. Greek (&quot;naus&quot;), &quot;ship&quot;, (&quot;nautes&quot;), &quot;seaman, sailor&quot;. The earliest attested form of the word is in the Mycenaean Greek compound word , &quot;na-u-do-mo&quot; (*), &quot;shipbuilders&quot;, written in Linear B syllabic script.

The word formerly denoted fleets of both commercial and military nature. In modern usage &quot;navy&quot; used alone always denotes a military fleet, although the term &quot;merchant navy&quot; for a commercial fleet still incorporates the non-military word sense. This overlap in word senses between commercial and military fleets grew out of the inherently dual-use nature of fleets; centuries ago, nationality was a trait that unified a fleet across both civilian and military uses. Although nationality of commercial vessels has little importance in peacetime trade other than for tax avoidance, it can have greater meaning during wartime, when supply chains become matters of patriotic attack and defense, and when in some cases private vessels are even temporarily converted to military vessels. The latter was especially important, and common, before 20th-century military technology existed, when merely adding artillery and naval infantry to any sailing vessel could render it fully as martial as any military-owned vessel. Such privateering has been rendered obsolete in blue-water strategy since modern missile and aircraft systems grew to leapfrog over artillery and infantry in many respects; but privateering nevertheless remains potentially relevant in littoral warfare of a limited and asymmetric nature.

== History ==

Naval warfare developed when humans first fought from water-borne vessels. Before the introduction of the cannon and ships with enough capacity to carry them, navy warfare primarily involved ramming and boarding actions. In the time of ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, naval warfare centered on long, narrow vessels powered by banks of oarsmen (such as triremes and quinqueremes) designed to ram and sink enemy vessels or come alongside the enemy vessel so its occupants could be attacked hand-to-hand. Naval warfare continued in this vein through the Middle Ages until the cannon became commonplace and capable of being reloaded quickly enough to be reused in the same battle. 

In ancient China, large naval battles were known since the Qin dynasty (&quot;also see&quot; Battle of Red Cliffs, 208), employing the war junk during the Han dynasty. However, China&#x27;s first official standing navy was not established until the Southern Song dynasty in the 12th century, a time when gunpowder was a revolutionary new application to warfare. The Chola Dynasty in Southern India had a navy composed of trade ships transporting armies overseas. The Chola Navy reached its peak under Rajendra I, and was most notably used in invasions of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.

Nusantaran thalassocracies made extensive use of naval power and technologies. This enabled the seafaring local people (either Malays of Srivijaya or Javanese of Mataram) to attack as far as the coast of Tanzania and Mozambique with 1000 boats and attempted to take the citadel of Qanbaloh, about 7,000 km to their West, in 945–946 AD. In 1350 AD Majapahit launched its largest military expedition, the invasion of Pasai, with 400 large jong and innumerable smaller vessels. The second largest military expedition, invasion of Singapura in 1398, Majapahit deployed 300 jong with no less than 200,000 men. The average jong used by Majapahit would be about 76.18–79.81 m LOA, carrying 600–700 men, with 1200–1400 tons deadweight.

The mass and deck space required to carry a large number of cannon made oar-based propulsion impossible, and ships came to rely primarily on sails. Warships were designed to carry increasing numbers of cannon and naval tactics evolved to bring a ship&#x27;s firepower to bear in a broadside, with ships-of-the-line arranged in a line of battle.

The development of large capacity, sail-powered ships carrying cannon led to a rapid expansion of European navies, especially the Spanish and Portuguese navies that dominated in the 16th and early 17th centuries, and helped propel the Age of Discovery and colonialism. The repulsion of the Spanish Armada (1588) by the English fleet revolutionized naval warfare by the success of a guns-only strategy and caused a major overhaul of the Spanish Navy, partly along English lines, which resulted in even greater dominance by the Spanish. From the beginning of the 17th century the Dutch cannibalized the Portuguese Empire in the East and, with the immense wealth gained, challenged Spanish hegemony at sea. From the 1620s, Dutch raiders seriously troubled Spanish shipping and, after a number of battles that went both ways, the Dutch Navy finally broke the long dominance of the Spanish Navy in the Battle of the Downs (1639).

England emerged as a major naval power in the mid-17th century in the first Anglo-Dutch war with a technical victory. Successive decisive Dutch victories in the second and third Anglo-Dutch Wars confirmed the Dutch mastery of the seas during the Dutch Golden Age, financed by the expansion of the Dutch Empire. The French Navy won some important victories near the end of the 17th century but a focus upon land forces led to the French Navy&#x27;s relative neglect, which allowed the Royal Navy to emerge with an ever-growing advantage in size and quality, especially in tactics and experience, from 1695. As a response to growing naval influence of the navies of Portuguese, the warrior king of the Marathas, Shivaji laid the foundation of the Maratha navy in 1654.

Throughout the 18th century the Royal Navy gradually gained ascendancy over the French Navy, with victories in the War of Spanish Succession (1701–1714), inconclusive battles in the War of Austrian Succession (1740–1748), victories in the Seven Years&#x27; War (1754–1763), a partial reversal during the American War of Independence (1775–1783), and consolidation into uncontested supremacy during the 19th century from the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. These conflicts saw the development and refinement of tactics that came to be called the line of battle.

The next stage in the evolution of naval warfare was the introduction of metal plating along the hull sides. The increased mass required steam-powered engines, resulting in an arms race between armor and weapon thickness and firepower. The first armored vessels, the French and British , made wooden vessels obsolete. Another significant improvement came with the invention of the rotating turrets, which allowed the guns to be aimed independently of ship movement. The battle between and during the American Civil War (1861–1865) is often cited as the beginning of this age of maritime conflict. The Russian Navy was considered the third strongest in the world on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War, which turned to be a catastrophe for the Russian military in general and the Russian Navy in particular. Although neither party lacked courage, the Russians were defeated by the Japanese in the Battle of Port Arthur, which was the first time in warfare that mines were used for offensive purposes. The warships of the Baltic Fleet sent to the Far East were lost in the Battle of Tsushima. A further step change in naval firepower occurred when the United Kingdom launched in 1906, but naval tactics still emphasized the line of battle.

The first practical military submarines were developed in the late 19th century and by the end of World War I had proven to be a powerful arm of naval warfare. During World War II, Nazi Germany&#x27;s submarine fleet of U-boats almost starved the United Kingdom into submission and inflicted tremendous losses on U.S. coastal shipping. The , a sister ship of , was almost put out of action by miniature submarines known as X-Craft. The X-Craft severely damaged her and kept her in port for some months.

A major paradigm shift in naval warfare occurred with the introduction of the aircraft carrier. First at Taranto in 1940 and then at Pearl Harbor in 1941, the carrier demonstrated its ability to strike decisively at enemy ships out of sight and range of surface vessels. The Battle of Leyte Gulf (1944) was arguably the largest naval battle in history; it was also the last battle in which battleships played a significant role. By the end of World War II, the carrier had become the dominant force of naval warfare.

World War II also saw the United States become by far the largest naval power in the world. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the United States Navy possessed over 70% of the world&#x27;s total numbers and total tonnage of naval vessels of 1,000 tons or greater. Throughout the rest of the 20th century, the United States Navy would maintain a tonnage greater than that of the next 17 largest navies combined. During the Cold War, the Soviet Navy became a significant armed force, with large numbers of large, heavily armed ballistic missile submarines and extensive use of heavy, long-ranged antisurface missiles to counter the numerous United States carrier battle groups. Only two nations, the United States and France, presently operate CATOBAR carriers of any size, while Russia, China and India operate sizeable STOBAR carriers (although all three are originally of Russian design). The United Kingdom is also operating two carriers, which are the largest STOVL vessels in service, and India is currently building one aircraft carrier, , and considering another. France is also looking at a new carrier, probably using a CATOBAR system and possibly based on the British &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; design.

== Operations ==
A navy typically operates from one or more naval bases. The base is a port that is specialized in naval operations, and often includes housing, a munitions depot, docks for the vessels, and various repair facilities. During times of war temporary bases may be constructed in closer proximity to strategic locations, as it is advantageous in terms of patrols and station-keeping. Nations with historically strong naval forces have found it advantageous to obtain basing rights in other countries in areas of strategic interest.

Navy ships can operate independently or with a group, which may be a small squadron of comparable ships, or a larger naval fleet of various specialized ships. The commander of a fleet travels in the flagship, which is usually the most powerful vessel in the group. Before radio was invented, commands from the flagship were communicated by means of flags. At night signal lamps could be used for a similar purpose. Later these were replaced by the radio transmitter, or the flashing light when radio silence was needed.

A &quot;blue water navy&quot; is designed to operate far from the coastal waters of its home nation. These are ships capable of maintaining station for long periods of time in deep ocean, and will have a long logistical tail for their support. Many are also nuclear powered to save having to refuel. By contrast a &quot;brown water navy&quot; operates in the coastal periphery and along inland waterways, where larger ocean-going naval vessels can not readily enter. Regional powers may maintain a &quot;green water navy&quot; as a means of localized force projection. Blue water fleets may require specialized vessels, such as minesweepers, when operating in the littoral regions along the coast.

== Traditions ==


A basic tradition is that all ships commissioned in a navy are referred to as ships rather than vessels, with the exception of destroyers and submarines, which are known as boats. The prefix on a ship&#x27;s name indicates that it is a commissioned ship.

An important tradition on board naval vessels of some nations has been the ship&#x27;s bell. This was historically used to mark the passage of time, as warning devices in heavy fog, and for alarms and ceremonies.

The ship&#x27;s captain, and more senior officers are &quot;piped&quot; aboard the ship using a Boatswain&#x27;s call.

In the United States, the First Navy Jack is a flag that has the words, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot; on the flag.

By English tradition, ships have been referred to as a &quot;she&quot;. However, it was long considered bad luck to permit women to sail on board naval vessels. To do so would invite a terrible storm that would wreck the ship. The only women that were welcomed on board were figureheads mounted on the prow of the ship.

Firing a cannon salute partially disarms the ship, so firing a cannon for no combat reason showed respect and trust. As the tradition evolved, the number of cannons fired became an indication of the rank of the official being saluted.

== Naval organization ==
=== Ships ===

Historically, navy ships were primarily intended for warfare. They were designed to withstand damage and to inflict the same, but only carried munitions and supplies for the voyage (rather than merchant cargo). Often, other ships that were not built specifically for warfare, such as the galleon or the armed merchant ships in World War II, did carry armaments. In more recent times, navy ships have become more specialized and have included supply ships, troop transports, repair ships, oil tankers and other logistics support ships as well as combat ships.

Modern navy combat ships are generally divided into seven main categories: aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, and amphibious assault ships. There are also support and auxiliary ships, including the oiler, minesweeper, patrol boat, hydrographic and oceanographic survey ship and tender. During the age of sail, the ship categories were divided into the ship of the line, frigate, and sloop-of-war.

Naval ship names are typically prefixed by an abbreviation indicating the national navy in which they serve. For a list of the prefixes used with ship names (HMS, USS, LÉ, etc.) see ship prefix.

Today&#x27;s warships are significantly faster than in years past, thanks to much improved propulsion systems. Also, the efficiency of the engines has improved, in terms of fuel, and of how many sailors it takes to operate them. In World War II, ships needed to refuel very often. However, today ships can go on very long journeys without refueling. Also, in World War II, the engine room needed about a dozen sailors to work the many engines, however, today, only about four or five are needed (depending on the class of the ship). Today, naval strike groups on longer missions are always followed by a range of support and replenishment ships supplying them with anything from fuel and munitions, to medical treatment and postal services. This allows strike groups and combat ships to remain at sea for several months at a time.

=== Boats ===
The term &quot;boat&quot; refers to small craft limited in their use by size and usually not capable of making lengthy independent voyages at sea. The old navy adage to differentiate between ships and boats is that boats are capable of being carried by ships. (Submarines by this rule are ships rather than boats, but are customarily referred to as boats reflecting their previous smaller size.)

Navies use many types of boat, ranging from dinghies to landing craft. They are powered by either diesel engines, out-board gasoline engines, or waterjets. Most boats are built of aluminum, fiberglass, or steel. Rigid-hulled inflatable boats are also used.

Patrol boats are used for patrols of coastal areas, lakes and large rivers.

Landing craft are designed to carry troops, vehicles, or cargo from ship to shore under combat conditions, to unload, to withdraw from the beach, and to return to the ship. They are rugged, with powerful engines, and usually armed. There are many types in today&#x27;s navies including hovercraft. They will typically have a power-operated bow ramp, a cargo well and after structures that house engine rooms, pilot houses, and stowage compartments. These boats are sometimes carried by larger ships.

Special operations craft are high-speed craft used for insertion and extraction of special forces personnel and some may be transportable (and deployed) by air.

Boats used in non-combat roles include lifeboats, mail boats, line handling boats, buoy boats, aircraft rescue boats, torpedo retrievers, explosive ordnance disposal craft, utility boats, dive boats, targets, and work boats. Boats are also used for survey work, tending divers, and minesweeping operations. Boats for carrying cargo and personnel are sometimes known as launches, gigs, barges or shore party boats.

=== Units ===
Naval forces are typically arranged into units based on the number of ships included, a single ship being the smallest operational unit. Ships may be combined into squadrons or flotillas, which may be formed into fleets. The largest unit size may be the whole Navy or Admiralty.

A task force can be assembled using ships from different fleets for an operational task.
=== Personnel ===
Despite their acceptance in many areas of naval service, female sailors were not permitted to serve on board U.S. submarines until the U.S. Navy lifted the ban in April 2010. The major reasons historically cited by the U.S. Navy were the extended duty tours and close conditions which afford almost no privacy. The United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy has had similar restrictions. Australia, Canada, Norway, and Spain previously opened submarine service to women sailors.

=== Ranks ===
A navy will typically have two sets of ranks, one for enlisted personnel and one for officers.

Typical ranks for commissioned officers include the following, in ascending order (Commonwealth ranks are listed first on each line; USA ranks are listed second in those instances where they differ from Commonwealth ranks):
* Midshipman / Ensign / Corvette Lieutenant
* Sub Lieutenant / Lieutenant Junior Grade / Frigate Lieutenant
* Lieutenant (Commonwealth &amp; US)/ Ship-of-the-Line Lieutenant / Captain Lieutenant
* Lieutenant Commander (Commonwealth &amp; US)/ Corvette Captain
* Commander (Commonwealth &amp; US)/ Frigate Captain
* Captain (Commonwealth &amp; US)/ Ship-of-the-Line Captain
* Commodore / Flotilla Admiral (in US only: Rear Admiral (lower half))
* Rear Admiral (in US only: Rear Admiral (upper half))
* Vice Admiral (Commonwealth &amp; US)
* Admiral (Commonwealth &amp; US)
* Admiral of the Fleet (Commonwealth) / Fleet Admiral (US) / Grand Admiral

&quot;Flag officers&quot; include any rank that includes the word &quot;admiral&quot; (or commodore in services other than the US Navy), and are generally in command of a battle group, strike group or similar flotilla of ships, rather than a single ship or aspect of a ship. However, commodores can also be temporary or honorary positions. For example, during World War II, a Navy captain was assigned duty as a convoy commodore, which meant that he was still a captain, but in charge of all the merchant vessels in the convoy.

The most senior rank employed by a navy will tend to vary depending on the size of a navy and whether it is wartime or peacetime, for example, few people have ever held the rank of Fleet Admiral in the U.S. Navy, the chief of the Royal Australian Navy holds the rank of Vice Admiral, and the chief of the Irish Naval Service holds the rank of Commodore.

== Naval infantry ==

Naval infantry, commonly known as marines, are a category of infantry that form part of a state&#x27;s naval forces and perform roles on land and at sea, including amphibious operations, as well as other, naval roles. They also perform other tasks, including land warfare, separate from naval operations.

During the era of the Roman empire, naval forces included marine legionaries for maritime boarding actions. These were troops primarily trained in land warfare, and did not need to be skilled at handling a ship. Much later during the age of sail, a component of marines served a similar role, being ship-borne soldiers who were used either during boarding actions, as sharp-shooters, or in raids along shorelines.

The Spanish &quot;Infantería de Marina&quot; was formed in 1537, making it the oldest, current marine force in the world. The British Royal Marines combine being both a ship-based force and also being specially trained in commando frogman-style operations and tactics, operating in some cases separately from the rest of the Royal Navy. The Royal Marines also have their own special forces unit.

In the majority of countries, the marine force is an integral part of the navy but there are variations such as the French Troupes de marine, which is actually part of the French Army. The United States Marine Corps is a separate armed service within the United States Department of the Navy, with its own leadership structure.

== Naval aviation ==

Naval aviation is the application of military air power by navies, whether from warships that embark aircraft, or land bases.

In World War I, several navies used floatplanes and flying boats – mainly for scouting. By World War II, aircraft carriers could carry bomber aircraft capable of attacking naval and land targets, as well as fighter aircraft for defence. Since World War II helicopters have been embarked on smaller ships in roles such as anti-submarine warfare and transport. Some navies have also operated land-based aircraft in roles such as maritime patrol and training.

Naval aviation forces primarily perform naval roles at sea. However, they are also used in a variety of other roles.

<text>In mathematics, a normed vector space or normed space is a vector space over the real or complex numbers on which a norm is defined. A norm is a generalization of the intuitive notion of &quot;length&quot; in the physical world. If formula_1 is a vector space over formula_2, where formula_2 is a field equal to formula_4 or to formula_5, then a norm on formula_1 is a map formula_7, typically denoted by formula_8, satisfying the following four axioms:

#Non-negativity: for every formula_9,formula_10.
#Positive definiteness: for every formula_11, formula_12 if and only if formula_13 is the zero vector.
# Absolute homogeneity: for every formula_14 and formula_9,formula_16
# Triangle inequality: for every formula_9 and formula_18,formula_19

If formula_1 is a real or complex vector space as above, and formula_21 is a norm on formula_1, then the ordered pair formula_23 is called a normed vector space. If it is clear from context which norm is intended, then it is common to denote the normed vector space simply by formula_1.

A norm induces a distance, called its , by the formula
formula_25
which makes any normed vector space into a metric space and a topological vector space. If this metric space is complete then the normed space is a Banach space. Every normed vector space can be &quot;uniquely extended&quot; to a Banach space, which makes normed spaces intimately related to Banach spaces. Every Banach space is a normed space but converse is not true. For example, the set of the finite sequences of real numbers can be normed with the Euclidean norm, but it is not complete for this norm. 

An inner product space is a normed vector space whose norm is the square root of the inner product of a vector and itself. The Euclidean norm of a Euclidean vector space is a special case that allows defining Euclidean distance by the formula
formula_26

The study of normed spaces and Banach spaces is a fundamental part of functional analysis, a major subfield of mathematics.

==Definition==
A normed vector space is a vector space equipped with a norm. A is a vector space equipped with a seminorm.

A useful variation of the triangle inequality is
formula_27 
for any vectors formula_13 and formula_29

This also shows that a vector norm is a (uniformly) continuous function.

Property 3 depends on a choice of norm formula_30 on the field of scalars. When the scalar field is formula_31 (or more generally a subset of formula_32), this is usually taken to be the ordinary absolute value, but other choices are possible. For example, for a vector space over formula_33 one could take formula_30 to be the formula_35-adic absolute value.

==Topological structure==

If formula_36 is a normed vector space, the norm formula_37 induces a metric (a notion of &quot;distance&quot;) and therefore a topology on formula_38 This metric is defined in the natural way: the distance between two vectors formula_39 and formula_40 is given by formula_41 This topology is precisely the weakest topology which makes formula_37 continuous and which is compatible with the linear structure of formula_1 in the following sense:

#The vector addition formula_44 is jointly continuous with respect to this topology. This follows directly from the triangle inequality.
#The scalar multiplication formula_45 where formula_46 is the underlying scalar field of formula_47 is jointly continuous. This follows from the triangle inequality and homogeneity of the norm.

Similarly, for any seminormed vector space we can define the distance between two vectors formula_39 and formula_40 as formula_41 This turns the seminormed space into a pseudometric space (notice this is weaker than a metric) and allows the definition of notions such as continuity and convergence.
To put it more abstractly every seminormed vector space is a topological vector space and thus carries a topological structure which is induced by the semi-norm.

Of special interest are complete normed spaces, which are known as . 
Every normed vector space formula_1 sits as a dense subspace inside some Banach space; this Banach space is essentially uniquely defined by formula_1 and is called the of formula_38

Two norms on the same vector space are called if they define the same topology. On a finite-dimensional vector space (but not infinite dimensional vector spaces), all norms are equivalent (although the resulting metric spaces need not be the same) And since any Euclidean space is complete, we can thus conclude that all finite-dimensional normed vector spaces are Banach spaces.

A normed vector space formula_1 is locally compact if and only if the unit ball formula_55 is compact, which is the case if and only if formula_1 is finite-dimensional; this is a consequence of Riesz&#x27;s lemma. (In fact, a more general result is true: a topological vector space is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional. The point here is that we don&#x27;t assume the topology comes from a norm.)

The topology of a seminormed vector space has many nice properties. Given a neighbourhood system formula_57 around 0 we can construct all other neighbourhood systems as
formula_58
with
formula_59

Moreover, there exists a neighbourhood basis for the origin consisting of absorbing and convex sets. As this property is very useful in functional analysis, generalizations of normed vector spaces with this property are studied under the name locally convex spaces. 

A norm (or seminorm) formula_60 on a topological vector space formula_61 is continuous if and only if the topology formula_62 that formula_60 induces on formula_64 is coarser than formula_65 (meaning, formula_66), which happens if and only if there exists some open ball formula_67 in formula_68 (such as maybe formula_69 for example) that is open in formula_61 (said different, such that formula_71).

== Normable spaces ==

A topological vector space formula_61 is called normable if there exists a norm formula_73 on formula_64 such that the canonical metric formula_75 induces the topology formula_65 on formula_77
The following theorem is due to Kolmogorov:

Kolmogorov&#x27;s normability criterion: A Hausdorff topological vector space is normable if and only if there exists a convex, von Neumann bounded neighborhood of formula_78

A product of a family of normable spaces is normable if and only if only finitely many of the spaces are non-trivial (that is, formula_79). Furthermore, the quotient of a normable space formula_64 by a closed vector subspace formula_81 is normable, and if in addition formula_64&#x27;s topology is given by a norm formula_83 then the map formula_84 given by formula_85 is a well defined norm on formula_86 that induces the quotient topology on formula_87

If formula_64 is a Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space then the following are equivalent:

# formula_64 is normable.
# formula_64 has a bounded neighborhood of the origin.
# the strong dual space formula_91 of formula_64 is normable.
# the strong dual space formula_91 of formula_64 is metrizable.

Furthermore, formula_64 is finite dimensional if and only if formula_96 is normable (here formula_96 denotes formula_98 endowed with the weak-* topology).

The topology formula_65 of the Fréchet space formula_100 as defined in the article on spaces of test functions and distributions, is defined by a countable family of norms but it is a normable space because there does not exist any norm formula_60 on formula_102 such that the topology that this norm induces is equal to formula_103 

Even if a metrizable topological vector space has a topology that is defined by a family of norms, then it may nevertheless still fail to be normable space (meaning that its topology can not be defined by any norm). 
An example of such a space is the Fréchet space formula_100 whose definition can be found in the article on spaces of test functions and distributions, because its topology formula_65 is defined by a countable family of norms but it is a normable space because there does not exist any norm formula_60 on formula_102 such that the topology this norm induces is equal to formula_103 
In fact, the topology of a locally convex space formula_64 can be a defined by a family of on formula_64 if and only if there exists continuous norm on formula_77

==Linear maps and dual spaces==

The most important maps between two normed vector spaces are the continuous linear maps. Together with these maps, normed vector spaces form a category.

The norm is a continuous function on its vector space. All linear maps between finite dimensional vector spaces are also continuous.

An &quot;isometry&quot; between two normed vector spaces is a linear map formula_112 which preserves the norm (meaning formula_113 for all vectors formula_40). Isometries are always continuous and injective. A surjective isometry between the normed vector spaces formula_1 and formula_116 is called an &quot;isometric isomorphism&quot;, and formula_1 and formula_116 are called &quot;isometrically isomorphic&quot;. Isometrically isomorphic normed vector spaces are identical for all practical purposes.

When speaking of normed vector spaces, we augment the notion of dual space to take the norm into account. The dual formula_119 of a normed vector space formula_1 is the space of all &quot;continuous&quot; linear maps from formula_1 to the base field (the complexes or the reals) — such linear maps are called &quot;functionals&quot;. The norm of a functional formula_122 is defined as the supremum of formula_123 where formula_40 ranges over all unit vectors (that is, vectors of norm formula_125) in formula_38 This turns formula_119 into a normed vector space. An important theorem about continuous linear functionals on normed vector spaces is the Hahn–Banach theorem.

==Normed spaces as quotient spaces of seminormed spaces==

The definition of many normed spaces (in particular, Banach spaces) involves a seminorm defined on a vector space and then the normed space is defined as the quotient space by the subspace of elements of seminorm zero. For instance, with the formula_128 spaces, the function defined by
formula_129
is a seminorm on the vector space of all functions on which the Lebesgue integral on the right hand side is defined and finite. However, the seminorm is equal to zero for any function supported on a set of Lebesgue measure zero. These functions form a subspace which we &quot;quotient out&quot;, making them equivalent to the zero function.

==Finite product spaces==

Given formula_130 seminormed spaces formula_131 with seminorms formula_132 denote the product space by
formula_133
where vector addition defined as
formula_134
and scalar multiplication defined as
formula_135

Define a new function formula_136 by
formula_137
which is a seminorm on formula_77 The function formula_139 is a norm if and only if all formula_140 are norms.

More generally, for each real formula_141 the map formula_136 defined by 
formula_143
is a semi norm. 
For each formula_35 this defines the same topological space.

A straightforward argument involving elementary linear algebra shows that the only finite-dimensional seminormed spaces are those arising as the product space of a normed space and a space with trivial seminorm. Consequently, many of the more interesting examples and applications of seminormed spaces occur for infinite-dimensional vector spaces.

<text>The Nicene Creed, also called the Creed of Constantinople, is the defining statement of belief of Nicene Christianity and in those Christian denominations that adhere to it.

The original Nicene Creed was first adopted at the First Council of Nicaea in 325. According to the traditional view, forwarded by the Council of Chalcedon of 451, the Creed was amended in 381 by the First Council of Constantinople as &quot;consonant to the holy and great Synod of Nice.&quot; However, many scholars comment on these ancient Councils saying &quot;there is a failure of evidence&quot; for this position since no one between the years of 381–451 thought of it in this light. Further, a creed &quot;almost identical in form&quot; was used as early as 374 by St. Epiphanius of Salamis. Nonetheless, the amended form is presently referred to as the Nicene Creed or the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. 

J.N.D. Kelly, who stands among historians as an authority on creedal statements, disagrees with the aforementioned assessment. He argues that since the First Council of Constantinople was not considered ecumenical until the council of Chalcedon in 451, therefore the absence of documentation during this period does not logically necessitate rejecting the amended creed as an expansion of the original Nicene Creed of 325.

The Nicene Creed is part of the profession of faith required of those undertaking important functions within the Orthodox, Catholic and Lutheran Churches. Nicene Christianity regards Jesus as divine and &quot;begotten of the Father&quot;. Various conflicting theological views existed before the fourth century and these spurred the ecumenical councils which eventually developed the Nicene Creed, and various non-Nicene beliefs have emerged and re-emerged since the fourth century, all of which are considered heresies by adherents of Nicene Christianity.

In Western Christianity, the Nicene Creed is in use alongside the less widespread Apostles&#x27; Creed and Athanasian Creed. However, part of it can be found as an &quot;Authorized Affirmation of Faith&quot; in the main volume of the &quot;Common Worship&quot; liturgy of the Church of England published in 2000. In musical settings, particularly when sung in Latin, this creed is usually referred to by its first word, . On Sundays and solemnities, one of these two creeds is recited in the Roman Rite Mass after the homily. In the Byzantine Rite, the Nicene Creed is sung or recited at the Divine Liturgy, immediately preceding the Anaphora (eucharistic prayer) is also recited daily at compline.

== History ==
The purpose of a creed is to provide a doctrinal statement of correct belief among Christians amid controversy. The creeds of Christianity have been drawn up at times of conflict about doctrine: acceptance or rejection of a creed served to distinguish believers and heretics, particularly the adherents of Arianism. For that reason, a creed was called in Greek a , which originally meant half of a broken object which, when fitted to the other half, verified the bearer&#x27;s identity. The Greek word passed through Latin into English &quot;symbol&quot;, which only later took on the meaning of an outward sign of something.

The Nicene Creed was adopted to resolve the Arian controversy, whose leader, Arius, a clergyman of Alexandria, &quot;objected to Alexander&#x27;s (the bishop of the time) apparent carelessness in blurring the distinction of nature between the Father and the Son by his emphasis on eternal generation&quot;. Emperor Constantine called the Council at Nicaea to resolve the dispute in the church which resulted from the widespread adoption of Arius&#x27; teachings, which threatened to destabilize the entire empire. Following the formulation of the Nicene Creed, Arius&#x27; teachings were henceforth marked as heresy.

The Nicene Creed of 325 explicitly affirms the Father as the &quot;one God&quot; and as the &quot;Almighty,&quot; and Jesus Christ as &quot;the Son of God&quot;, as &quot;begotten of[...] the essence of the Father,&quot; and therefore as &quot;consubstantial with the Father,&quot; meaning, &quot;of the same substance&quot; as the Father; &quot;very God of very God.&quot; The Creed of 325 does mention the Holy Spirit but not as &quot;God&quot; or as &quot;consubstantial with the Father.&quot; The 381 revision of the creed at Constantinople (i.e., the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed), which is often simply referred to as the &quot;Nicene Creed,&quot; speaks of the Holy Spirit as worshipped and glorified with the Father and the Son.

The Athanasian Creed, formulated about a century later, which was not the product of any known church council and not used in Eastern Christianity, describes in much greater detail the relationship between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The earlier Apostles&#x27; Creed, apparently formulated before the Arian controversy arose in the fourth century, does not describe the Son or the Holy Spirit as &quot;God&quot; or as &quot;consubstantial with the Father.&quot;

Thomas Aquinas stated that the phrase &quot;for us men, and for our salvation&quot; was to refute the error of Origen, &quot;who alleged that by the power of Christ&#x27;s Passion even the devils were to be set free.&quot; He also stated that the phrases stating Jesus was made &quot;incarnate by the Holy Spirit&quot; was to refute the Manicheans &quot;so that we may believe that He assumed true flesh and not a phantastic body,&quot; and &quot;He came down from Heaven&quot; was to refute the error of Photinus, &quot;who asserted that Christ was no more than a man.&quot; Furthermore, the phrase &quot;and He was made man&quot; was to &quot;exclude the error of Nestorius, according to whose contention the Son of God ... would be said to dwell in man [rather] than to be man.&quot;

=== Original Nicene Creed of 325 ===
The original Nicene Creed was first adopted at the First Council of Nicaea, which opened on 19 June 325. The text ends with anathemas against Arian propositions, preceded by the words: &quot;We believe in the Holy Spirit&quot; which terminates the statements of belief.

F. J. A. Hort and Adolf von Harnack argued that the Nicene Creed was the local creed of Caesarea (an important center of Early Christianity) recited in the council by Eusebius of Caesarea. Their case relied largely on a very specific interpretation of Eusebius&#x27; own account of the council&#x27;s proceedings. More recent scholarship has not been convinced by their arguments. The large number of secondary divergences from the text of the creed quoted by Eusebius make it unlikely that it was used as a starting point by those who drafted the conciliar creed. Their initial text was probably a local creed from a Syro-Palestinian source into which they inserted phrases to define the Nicene theology. The Eusebian Creed may thus have been either a second or one of many nominations for the Nicene Creed.

The 1911 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; says that, soon after the Council of Nicaea, the church composed new formulae of faith, most of them variations of the Nicene Symbol, to meet new phases of Arianism, of which there were at least four before the Council of Sardica (341), at which a new form was presented and inserted in its acts, although the council did not accept it.

=== Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed ===
What is known as the &quot;Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed&quot; or the &quot;Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed&quot;, received this name because it was adopted at the Second Ecumenical Council held in Constantinople in 381 as a modification of the original Nicene Creed of 325. In that light, it also came to be very commonly known simply as the &quot;Nicene Creed&quot;. It is the only authoritative &quot;&quot; statement of the Christian faith accepted by the Catholic Church (with the addition of the Filioque), the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Church of the East, and much of Protestantism including the Anglican communion. (The Apostles&#x27; and Athanasian creeds are not as widely accepted.)

It differs in a number of respects, both by addition and omission, from the creed adopted at the First Council of Nicaea. The most notable difference is the additional section:

Since the end of the 19th century, scholars have questioned the traditional explanation of the origin of this creed, which has been passed down in the name of the council, whose official acts have been lost over time. A local council of Constantinople in 382 and the Third Ecumenical Council (Council of Ephesus of 431) made no mention of it, with the latter affirming the 325 creed of Nicaea as a valid statement of the faith and using it to denounce Nestorianism. Though some scholarship claims that hints of the later creed&#x27;s existence are discernible in some writings, no extant document gives its text or makes explicit mention of it earlier than the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451. Many of the bishops of the 451 council themselves had never heard of it and initially greeted it skeptically, but it was then produced from the episcopal archives of Constantinople, and the council accepted it &quot;not as supplying any omission but as an authentic interpretation of the faith of Nicaea&quot;. In spite of the questions raised, it is considered most likely that this creed was in fact introduced at the 381 Second Ecumenical Council.

On the basis of evidence both internal and external to the text, it has been argued that this creed originated not as an editing of the original Creed proposed at Nicaea in 325, but as an independent creed (probably an older baptismal creed) modified to make it more like the Nicene Creed. Some scholars have argued that the creed may have been presented at Chalcedon as &quot;a precedent for drawing up new creeds and definitions to supplement the Creed of Nicaea, as a way of getting round the ban on new creeds in Canon 7 of Ephesus&quot;. It is generally agreed that the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed is not simply an expansion of the Creed of Nicaea, and was probably based on another traditional creed independent of the one from Nicaea.

The Third Ecumenical Council (Ephesus) reaffirmed the original 325 version of the Nicene Creed and declared that &quot;it is unlawful for any man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a different () faith as a rival to that established by the holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nicaea&quot; (i.e., the 325 creed). The word is more accurately translated as used by the council to mean &quot;different&quot;, &quot;contradictory&quot;, rather than &quot;another&quot;. This statement has been interpreted as a prohibition against changing this creed or composing others, but not all accept this interpretation. This question is connected with the controversy whether a creed proclaimed by an ecumenical council is definitive in excluding not only excisions from its text but also additions to it.

In one respect, the Eastern Orthodox Church&#x27;s received text of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed differs from the earliest text, which is included in the acts of the Council of Chalcedon of 451: The Eastern Orthodox Church uses the singular forms of verbs such as &quot;I believe&quot;, in place of the plural form (&quot;we believe&quot;) used by the council. Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches use exactly the same form of the creed, since the Catholic Church teaches that it is wrong to add &quot;and the Son&quot; to the Greek verb &quot;&quot;, though correct to add it to the Latin , which does not have precisely the same meaning. The form generally used in Western churches does add &quot;and the Son&quot; and also the phrase &quot;God from God&quot;, which is found in the original 325 Creed.

=== Comparison between creed of 325 and creed of 381 ===
The following table, which indicates by square brackets the portions of the 325 text that were omitted or moved in 381, and uses to indicate what phrases, absent in the 325 text, were added in 381, juxtaposes the earlier (AD 325) and later (AD 381) forms of this creed in the English translation given in Philip Schaff&#x27;s compilation &quot;The Creeds of Christendom&quot; (1877).

=== Filioque controversy ===

In the late 6th century, some Latin-speaking churches added the word (&quot;and the Son&quot;) to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, in what many Eastern Orthodox Christians have at a later stage argued is a violation of Canon VII of the Third Ecumenical Council, since the words were not included in the text by either the Council of Nicaea or that of Constantinople. This was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014. eventually became one of the main causes for the East-West Schism in 1054, and the failures of the repeated union attempts.

=== Views on the importance of this creed ===
The view that the Nicene Creed can serve as a touchstone of true Christian faith is reflected in the name &quot;symbol of faith&quot;, which was given to it in Greek and Latin, when in those languages the word &quot;symbol&quot; meant a &quot;token for identification (by comparison with a counterpart)&quot;.

In the Roman Rite mass, the Latin text of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, with (God from God) and (and from the Son), phrases absent in the original text, was previously the only form used for the &quot;profession of faith&quot;. The Roman Missal now refers to it jointly with the Apostles&#x27; Creed as &quot;the Symbol or Profession of Faith or Creed&quot;, describing the second as &quot;the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles&#x27; Creed&quot;.

Some evangelical and other Christians consider the Nicene Creed helpful and to a certain extent authoritative, but not infallibly so in view of their belief that only Scripture is truly authoritative. Non-Trinitarian groups, such as the Church of the New Jerusalem, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, explicitly reject some of the statements in the Nicene Creed.

== Ancient liturgical versions ==
There are several designations for the two forms of the Nicene Creed, some with overlapping meanings:
* Nicene Creed or the Creed of Nicaea is used to refer to the original version adopted at the First Council of Nicaea (325), to the revised version adopted by the First Council of Constantinople (381), to the Latin version that includes the phrase and , and to the Armenian version, which does not include &quot;and from the Son&quot;, but does include &quot;God from God&quot; and many other phrases.
* Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed can stand for the revised version of Constantinople (381) or the later Latin version or various other versions.
* Icon/Symbol of the Faith is the usual designation for the revised version of Constantinople 381 in the Orthodox churches, where this is the only creed used in the liturgy.
* Profession of Faith of the 318 Fathers refers specifically to the version of Nicaea 325 (traditionally, 318 bishops took part at the First Council of Nicaea).
* Profession of Faith of the 150 Fathers refers specifically to the version of Constantinople 381 (traditionally, 150 bishops took part at the First Council of Constantinople).

This section is not meant to collect the texts of all liturgical versions of the Nicene Creed, and provides only three, the Greek, the Latin, and the Armenian, of special interest. Others are mentioned separately, but without the texts. All ancient liturgical versions, even the Greek, differ at least to some small extent from the text adopted by the First Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople. The Creed was originally written in Greek, owing among other things to the location of the two councils.

Although the councils&#x27; texts have (&quot; believe[...] confess[...] await&quot;), the creed that the Churches of Byzantine tradition use in their liturgy has (&quot; believe[...] confess[...] await&quot;), accentuating the personal nature of recitation of the creed. The Latin text, as well as using the singular, has two additions: (God from God) and (and from the Son). The Armenian text has many more additions, and is included as showing how that ancient church has chosen to recite the creed with these numerous elaborations of its contents.

An English translation of the Armenian text is added; English translations of the Greek and Latin liturgical texts are given at English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use.

=== Greek liturgical text ===
=== Latin liturgical version ===
The Latin text adds and to the Greek. On the latter see The Filioque Controversy above. Inevitably also, the overtones of the terms used, such as a and , differ ( meaning ruler of all; meaning omnipotent, almighty). The implications of the difference in overtones of and was the object of the study &quot;The Greek and the Latin Traditions regarding the Procession of the Holy Spirit&quot; published by the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity in 1996.

Again, the terms and , translated as &quot;of one being&quot; or &quot;consubstantial&quot;, have different overtones, being based respectively on Greek (stable being, immutable reality, substance, essence, true nature), and Latin (that of which a thing consists, the being, essence, contents, material, substance).

, which in classical Latin is used with the accusative case of the thing held to be true (and with the dative of the person to whom credence is given), is here used three times with the preposition &quot;in&quot;, a literal translation of the Greek (), and once in the classical preposition-less construction ().

=== Armenian liturgical text ===

==== English translation of the Armenian version ====
=== Other ancient liturgical versions ===
The version in the Church Slavonic language, used by several Eastern Orthodox churches is practically identical with the Greek liturgical version.

This version is used also by some Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches. Although the Union of Brest excluded addition of the Filioque, this was sometimes added by Ruthenian Catholics, whose older liturgical books also show the phrase in brackets, and by Ukrainian Catholics. Writing in 1971, the Ruthenian scholar Casimir Kucharek noted, &quot;In Eastern Catholic Churches, the may be omitted except when scandal would ensue. Most of the Eastern Catholic Rites use it.&quot; However, in the decades that followed 1971 it has come to be used more rarely.

The versions used by Oriental Orthodoxy and the Church of the East may differ from the Greek liturgical version in having &quot;We believe&quot;, as in the original text, instead of &quot;I believe&quot;.

==Indulgence==
In the Roman Catholic Church, to obtain the plenary indulgence once a day, it is necessary to visit a church or oratory to which the indulgence is attached and the recitation of the Sunday prayers, &quot;Creed&quot; and &quot;Hail Mary&quot;.

Recitation of the &quot;Apostles&#x27; Creed&quot; or the &quot;Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed&quot; is required to obtain a partial indulgence&quot;.

== English translations ==

The version found in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; is still commonly used by some English speakers, but more modern translations are now more common. The International Consultation on English Texts (later known as English Language Liturgical Consultation (ELLC)) published an English translation of the Nicene Creed, first in 1970 and then in successive revisions in 1971 and 1975. These texts were adopted by several churches.

The Roman Catholic Church in the United States adopted the 1971 version in 1973. The Catholic Church in other English-speaking countries adopted the 1975 version in 1975. They continued to use them until 2011, when it replaced them with the version in the &quot;Roman Missal third edition&quot;. The 1975 version was included in the 1979 Episcopal Church (United States) &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, but with one variation: in the line &quot;For us men and for our salvation&quot;, it omitted the word &quot;men&quot;.

<text>Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei (for example, nuclei of hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium), combine to form one or more atomic nuclei and neutrons. The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of energy. This difference in mass arises as a result of the difference in nuclear binding energy between the atomic nuclei before and after the fusion reaction. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers active or main-sequence stars and other high-magnitude stars, where large amounts of energy are released.

A nuclear fusion process that produces atomic nuclei lighter than iron-56 or nickel-62 will generally release energy. These elements have a relatively small mass and a relatively large binding energy per nucleon. Fusion of nuclei lighter than these releases energy (an exothermic process), while the fusion of heavier nuclei results in energy retained by the product nucleons, and the resulting reaction is endothermic. The opposite is true for the reverse process, called nuclear fission. Nuclear fusion uses lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, which are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as uranium, thorium and plutonium, are more fissionable. Elements heavier than nickel are produced in supernovae and kilonovae via the non-fusion r-process.

Applications of fusion include fusion power, thermonuclear weapons, and boosted fission weapons.

==History==
=== Theory ===

American chemist William Draper Harkins was the first to propose the concept of nuclear fusion in 1915. Francis William Aston&#x27;s 1919 invention of the mass spectrometer allowed the discovery that four hydrogen atoms are heavier than one helium atom. Thus in 1920, Arthur Eddington correctly predicted fusion of hydrogen into helium could be the primary source of stellar energy. 

Quantum tunneling was discovered by Friedrich Hund in 1927, with relation to electron levels. In 1928, George Gamow was the first to apply tunneling to the nucleus, first to alpha decay, then to fusion as an inverse process. From this, in 1929, Robert Atkinson and Fritz Houtermans made the first estimates for stellar fusion rates. 

In 1938, Hans Bethe worked with Charles Critchfield to enumerate the proton–proton chain that dominates Sun-type stars. In 1939, Bethe published the discovery of the CNO cycle common to higher-mass stars. 

=== Early experiments ===

During the 1920s, Patrick Blackett made the first conclusive experiments in artificial nuclear transmutation at the Cavendish Laboratory. There, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton built their generator on the inspiration of Gamow&#x27;s paper. In April 1932, they published experiments on the reaction: 

: + p → → 2 
where the intermediary nuclide was later confirmed to be the extremely short-lived beryllium-8. This has a claim to the first artificial fusion reaction. 

In papers from July and November 1933, Ernest Lawrence et. al. at the University of California Radiation Laboratory, in some of the earliest cyclotron experiments, accidentally produced the first deuterium-deuterium fusion reactions: 
: + → + p

The Radiation Lab, only detecting the resulting protons and neutrons, misinterpreted the source as some disintegration of the deuterons. In May 1934, Mark Oliphant, Paul Harteck, and Ernest Rutherford published an intentional deuterium fusion experiment, and made the discovery of both tritium and helium-3. This is widely considered the first experimental demonstration of fusion.

In 1938, Arthur Ruhlig at the University of Michigan made the first observation of deuterium–tritium fusion and its characteristic 14 MeV neutrons, now known as the most favourable reaction: 
In 1943, this work was reproduced at Purdue University under the direction of the Manhattan Project.

=== Weaponization ===

Research into fusion for military purposes began in the early 1940s as part of the Manhattan Project. The first artificial thermonuclear fusion reaction occurred during the 1951 US Greenhouse George nuclear test, using a small amount of deuterium–tritium gas. This produced the largest yield to date, at 225 kt, 15 times that of Little Boy. The first &quot;true&quot; thermonuclear weapon detonation i.e. a two-stage device, was the 1952 Ivy Mike test of a liquid deuterium-fusing device, yielding over 10 Mt. The key to this jump was the full utilization of the fission blast by the Teller-Ulam design.

The Soviet Union had begun their focus on a hydrogen bomb program earlier, and in 1953 carried out the RDS-6s test. This had international impacts as the first air-deliverable bomb using fusion, but yielded 400 kt and was limited by its single-stage design. The first Soviet two-stage test was RDS-37 in 1955 yielding 1.5 Mt, using an independently-reached version of the Teller-Ulam design.

Modern devices benefit from the usage of solid lithium deuteride with an enrichment of lithium-6. This is due to the Jetter cycle involving the exothermic reaction:
During thermonuclear detonations, this provides tritium for the highly energetic DT reaction, and benefits from its neutron production, creating a closed neutron cycle.

=== Fusion energy ===
While fusion bomb detonations were loosely considered for energy production, the possibility of controlled and sustained reactions remained the scientific focus for peaceful fusion power. Research into developing controlled fusion inside fusion reactors has been ongoing since the 1930s, with Los Alamos National Laboratory&#x27;s Scylla I device producing the first laboratory thermonuclear fusion in 1958, but the technology is still in its developmental phase.

The US National Ignition Facility, which uses laser-driven inertial confinement fusion, was designed with a goal of achieving a fusion energy gain factor (Q) of larger than one; the first large-scale laser target experiments were performed in June 2009 and ignition experiments began in early 2011. On 13 December 2022, the United States Department of Energy announced that on 5 December 2022, they had successfully accomplished break-even fusion, &quot;delivering 2.05 megajoules (MJ) of energy to the target, resulting in 3.15 MJ of fusion energy output.&quot;

Prior to this breakthrough, controlled fusion reactions had been unable to produce break-even (self-sustaining) controlled fusion. The two most advanced approaches for it are magnetic confinement (toroid designs) and inertial confinement (laser designs). Workable designs for a toroidal reactor that theoretically will deliver ten times more fusion energy than the amount needed to heat plasma to the required temperatures are in development (see ITER). The ITER facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2025. It will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in 2025, but is not expected to begin full deuterium–tritium fusion until 2035.

Private companies pursuing the commercialization of nuclear fusion received $2.6 billion in private funding in 2021 alone, going to many notable startups including but not limited to Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Helion Energy Inc., General Fusion, TAE Technologies Inc. and Zap Energy Inc.

One of the most recent breakthroughs to date in maintaining a sustained fusion reaction occurred in France&#x27;s WEST fusion reactor. It maintained a 90 million degree plasma for a record time of six minutes. This is a tokamak style reactor which is the same style as the upcoming ITER reactor.

==Process==

The release of energy with the fusion of light elements is due to the interplay of two opposing forces: the nuclear force, a manifestation of the strong interaction, which holds protons and neutrons tightly together in the atomic nucleus; and the Coulomb force, which causes positively charged protons in the nucleus to repel each other. Lighter nuclei (nuclei smaller than iron and nickel) are sufficiently small and proton-poor to allow the nuclear force to overcome the Coulomb force. This is because the nucleus is sufficiently small that all nucleons feel the short-range attractive force at least as strongly as they feel the infinite-range Coulomb repulsion. Building up nuclei from lighter nuclei by fusion releases the extra energy from the net attraction of particles. For larger nuclei, however, no energy is released, because the nuclear force is short-range and cannot act across larger nuclei.

Fusion powers stars and produces virtually all elements in a process called nucleosynthesis. The Sun is a main-sequence star, and, as such, generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. In its core, the Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen and makes 616 million metric tons of helium each second. The fusion of lighter elements in stars releases energy and the mass that always accompanies it. For example, in the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei to form helium, 0.645% of the mass is carried away in the form of kinetic energy of an alpha particle or other forms of energy, such as electromagnetic radiation.

It takes considerable energy to force nuclei to fuse, even those of the lightest element, hydrogen. When accelerated to high enough speeds, nuclei can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and be brought close enough such that the attractive nuclear force is greater than the repulsive Coulomb force. The strong force grows rapidly once the nuclei are close enough, and the fusing nucleons can essentially &quot;fall&quot; into each other and the result is fusion; this is an exothermic process.

Energy released in most nuclear reactions is much larger than in chemical reactions, because the binding energy that holds a nucleus together is greater than the energy that holds electrons to a nucleus. For example, the ionization energy gained by adding an electron to a hydrogen nucleus is —less than one-millionth of the released in the deuterium–tritium (D–T) reaction shown in the adjacent diagram. Fusion reactions have an energy density many times greater than nuclear fission; the reactions produce far greater energy per unit of mass even though &quot;individual&quot; fission reactions are generally much more energetic than &quot;individual&quot; fusion ones, which are themselves millions of times more energetic than chemical reactions. Via the mass–energy equivalence, fusion yields a 0.7% efficiency of reactant mass into energy. This can be only be exceeded by the extreme cases of the accretion process involving neutron stars or black holes, approaching 40% efficiency, and antimatter annihilation at 100% efficiency. (The complete conversion of one gram of matter would release of energy.)

==In astrophysics==
Fusion is responsible for the astrophysical production of the majority of elements lighter than iron. This includes most types of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and stellar nucleosynthesis. Non-fusion processes that contribute include the s-process and r-process in neutron merger and supernova nucleosynthesis, responsible for elements heavier than iron.

=== Stars ===


An important fusion process is the stellar nucleosynthesis that powers stars, including the Sun. In the 20th century, it was recognized that the energy released from nuclear fusion reactions accounts for the longevity of stellar heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in a star, starting from its initial hydrogen and helium abundance, provides that energy and synthesizes new nuclei. Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass of the star (and therefore the pressure and temperature in its core).

Around 1920, Arthur Eddington anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper &quot;The Internal Constitution of the Stars&quot;. At that time, the source of stellar energy was unknown; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein&#x27;s equation . This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy had not yet been discovered, nor even that stars are largely composed of hydrogen (see metallicity). Eddington&#x27;s paper reasoned that:

# The leading theory of stellar energy, the contraction hypothesis, should cause the rotation of a star to visibly speed up due to conservation of angular momentum. But observations of Cepheid variable stars showed this was not happening.
# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. 
# Francis Aston had also recently shown that the mass of a helium atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom (according to the then-prevailing theory of atomic structure which held atomic weight to be the distinguishing property between elements; work by Henry Moseley and Antonius van den Broek would later show that nucleic charge was the distinguishing property and that a helium nucleus, therefore, consisted of two hydrogen nuclei plus additional mass). This suggested that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.
# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (It is now known that most &#x27;ordinary&#x27; stars are usually made of around 70% to 75% hydrogen)
# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the &quot;crucible&quot; in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their atomic masses nothing more could be said at the time.

All of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.

The primary source of solar energy, and that of similar size stars, is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium (the proton–proton chain reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four protons into one alpha particle, with the release of two positrons and two neutrinos (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the CNO cycle and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs when a more massive star undergoes a violent supernova at the end of its life, a process known as supernova nucleosynthesis.

=== Black hole accretion disks ===
Similar to stellar fusion, extreme conditions within black hole accretion disks can allow fusion reactions. Calculations show the most energetic reactions occur around lower stellar mass black holes, below 10 solar masses, compared to those above 100. Beyond five Schwarzschild radii, carbon-burning and fusion of helium-3 dominates the reactions. Within this distance, around lower mass black holes, fusion of nitrogen, oxygen, neon, and magnesium can occur. In the extreme limit, the silicon-burning process can begin with the fusion of silicon and selenium nuclei.

=== Big Bang ===

From the period approximately 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang, the universe cooled from over 100 keV to 1 keV. This allowed the combination of protons and neutrons in deuterium nuclei, and beginning a rapid fusion chain into tritium and helium-3 and ending in predominantly helium-4, with a minimal fraction of lithium, beryllium, and boron nuclei.

==Requirements==
A substantial energy barrier of electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one another because of the repulsive electrostatic force between their positively charged protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the quantum effect in which nuclei can tunnel through coulomb forces.

When a nucleon such as a proton or neutron is added to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it to all the other nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but primarily to its immediate neighbors due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface-area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the nuclear force generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is important to keep in mind that nucleons are quantum objects. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.

The electrostatic force, on the other hand, is an inverse-square force, so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion from &quot;all&quot; the other protons in the nucleus. The electrostatic energy per nucleon due to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei atomic number grows.

The net result of the opposing electrostatic and strong nuclear forces is that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements iron and nickel, and then decreases for heavier nuclei. Eventually, the binding energy becomes negative and very heavy nuclei (all with more than 208 nucleons, corresponding to a diameter of about 6 nucleons) are not stable. The four most tightly bound nuclei, in decreasing order of binding energy per nucleon, are , , , and . Even though the nickel isotope, , is more stable, the iron isotope is an order of magnitude more common. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way for stars to create through the alpha process.

An exception to this general trend is the helium-4 nucleus, whose binding energy is higher than that of lithium, the next heavier element. This is because protons and neutrons are fermions, which according to the Pauli exclusion principle cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron&#x27;s energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons (it is a doubly magic nucleus), so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states. Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single quantum mechanical particle in nuclear physics, namely, the alpha particle.

The situation is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come close enough for long enough so the strong attractive nuclear force can take over and overcome the repulsive electrostatic force. This can also be described as the nuclei overcoming the so-called Coulomb barrier. The kinetic energy to achieve this can be lower than the barrier itself because of quantum tunneling.

The Coulomb barrier is smallest for isotopes of hydrogen, as their nuclei contain only a single positive charge. A diproton is not stable, so neutrons must also be involved, ideally in such a way that a helium nucleus, with its extremely tight binding, is one of the products.

Using deuterium–tritium fuel, the resulting energy barrier is about 0.1 MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an electron from hydrogen is 13.6 eV. The (intermediate) result of the fusion is an unstable 5He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1 MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining 4He nucleus is 3.5 MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6 MeV. This is many times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.

The reaction cross section (σ) is a measure of the probability of a fusion reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei. If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, e.g. a thermal distribution, then it is useful to perform an average over the distributions of the product of cross-section and velocity. This average is called the &#x27;reactivity&#x27;, denoted . The reaction rate (fusions per volume per time) is times the product of the reactant number densities:

:formula_1

If a species of nuclei is reacting with a nucleus like itself, such as the DD reaction, then the product formula_2 must be replaced by formula_3.

formula_4 increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of 10–100 keV. At these temperatures, well above typical ionization energies (13.6 eV in the hydrogen case), the fusion reactants exist in a plasma state.

The significance of formula_4 as a function of temperature in a device with a particular energy confinement time is found by considering the Lawson criterion. This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current advanced technical state.

== Artificial fusion ==
=== Thermonuclear fusion ===

Thermonuclear fusion is the process of atomic nuclei combining or &quot;fusing&quot; using high temperatures to drive them close enough together for this to become possible. Such temperatures cause the matter to become a plasma and, if confined, fusion reactions may occur due to collisions with extreme thermal kinetic energies of the particles. There are two forms of thermonuclear fusion: &quot;uncontrolled&quot;, in which the resulting energy is released in an uncontrolled manner, as it is in thermonuclear weapons (&quot;hydrogen bombs&quot;) and in most stars; and &quot;controlled&quot;, where the fusion reactions take place in an environment allowing some or all of the energy released to be harnessed for constructive purposes.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles, so by heating the material it will gain energy. After reaching sufficient temperature, given by the Lawson criterion, the energy of accidental collisions within the plasma is high enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier and the particles may fuse together.

In a deuterium–tritium fusion reaction, for example, the energy necessary to overcome the Coulomb barrier is 0.1 MeV. Converting between energy and temperature shows that the 0.1 MeV barrier would be overcome at a temperature in excess of 1.2 billion kelvin.

There are two effects that are needed to lower the actual temperature. One is the fact that temperature is the &quot;average&quot; kinetic energy, implying that some nuclei at this temperature would actually have much higher energy than 0.1 MeV, while others would be much lower. It is the nuclei in the high-energy tail of the velocity distribution that account for most of the fusion reactions. The other effect is quantum tunnelling. The nuclei do not actually have to have enough energy to overcome the Coulomb barrier completely. If they have nearly enough energy, they can tunnel through the remaining barrier. For these reasons fuel at lower temperatures will still undergo fusion events, at a lower rate.

&quot;Thermonuclear&quot; fusion is one of the methods being researched in the attempts to produce fusion power. If thermonuclear fusion becomes favorable to use, it would significantly reduce the world&#x27;s carbon footprint.

===Beam–beam or beam–target fusion===
Accelerator-based light-ion fusion is a technique using particle accelerators to achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient to induce light-ion fusion reactions.

Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and can be done in an efficient manner—requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The system can be arranged to accelerate ions into a static fuel-infused target, known as &quot;beam–target&quot; fusion, or by accelerating two streams of ions towards each other, &quot;beam–beam&quot; fusion. The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross-sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting bremsstrahlung radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube neutron generators are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves.

A number of attempts to recirculate the ions that &quot;miss&quot; collisions have been made over the years. One of the better-known attempts in the 1970s was Migma, which used a unique particle storage ring to capture ions into circular orbits and return them to the reaction area. Theoretical calculations made during funding reviews pointed out that the system would have significant difficulty scaling up to contain enough fusion fuel to be relevant as a power source. In the 1990s, a new arrangement using a field-reversed configuration (FRC) as the storage system was proposed by Norman Rostoker and continues to be studied by TAE Technologies . A closely related approach is to merge two FRC&#x27;s rotating in opposite directions, which is being actively studied by Helion Energy. Because these approaches all have ion energies well beyond the Coulomb barrier, they often suggest the use of alternative fuel cycles like p-11B that are too difficult to attempt using conventional approaches.

===Muon-catalyzed fusion===
Muon-catalyzed fusion is a fusion process that occurs at ordinary temperatures. It was studied in detail by Steven Jones in the early 1980s. Net energy production from this reaction has been unsuccessful because of the high energy required to create muons, their short 2.2 μs half-life, and the high chance that a muon will bind to the new alpha particle and thus stop catalyzing fusion.

===Other principles===
Some other confinement principles have been investigated.

* Antimatter-initialized fusion uses small amounts of antimatter to trigger a tiny fusion explosion. This has been studied primarily in the context of making nuclear pulse propulsion, and pure fusion bombs feasible. This is not near becoming a practical power source, due to the cost of manufacturing antimatter alone.
* Pyroelectric fusion was reported in April 2005 by a team at UCLA. The scientists used a pyroelectric crystal heated from , combined with a tungsten needle to produce an electric field of about 25 gigavolts per meter to ionize and accelerate deuterium nuclei into an erbium deuteride target. At the estimated energy levels, the D–D fusion reaction may occur, producing helium-3 and a 2.45 MeV neutron. Although it makes a useful neutron generator, the apparatus is not intended for power generation since it requires far more energy than it produces. D–T fusion reactions have been observed with a tritiated erbium target.
* Nuclear fusion–fission hybrid (hybrid nuclear power) is a proposed means of generating power by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by Hans Bethe during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to the delays in the realization of pure fusion.
* Project PACER, carried out at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in the mid-1970s, explored the possibility of a fusion power system that would involve exploding small hydrogen bombs (fusion bombs) inside an underground cavity. As an energy source, the system is the only fusion power system that could be demonstrated to work using existing technology. However, it would also require a large, continuous supply of nuclear bombs, making the economics of such a system rather questionable.
* Bubble fusion also called sonofusion was a proposed mechanism for achieving fusion via sonic cavitation which rose to prominence in the early 2000s. Subsequent attempts at replication failed and the principal investigator, Rusi Taleyarkhan, was judged guilty of research misconduct in 2008.

==Confinement in thermonuclear fusion==
The key problem in achieving thermonuclear fusion is how to confine the hot plasma. Due to the high temperature, the plasma cannot be in direct contact with any solid material, so it has to be located in a vacuum. Also, high temperatures imply high pressures. The plasma tends to expand immediately and some force is necessary to act against it. This force can take one of three forms: gravitation in stars, magnetic forces in magnetic confinement fusion reactors, or inertial as the fusion reaction may occur before the plasma starts to expand, so the plasma&#x27;s inertia is keeping the material together.

=== Gravitational confinement ===

One force capable of confining the fuel well enough to satisfy the Lawson criterion is gravity. The mass needed, however, is so great that gravitational confinement is only found in stars—the least massive stars capable of sustained fusion are red dwarfs, while brown dwarfs are able to fuse deuterium and lithium if they are of sufficient mass. In stars heavy enough, after the supply of hydrogen is exhausted in their cores, their cores (or a shell around the core) start fusing helium to carbon. In the most massive stars (at least 8–11 solar masses), the process is continued until some of their energy is produced by fusing lighter elements to iron. As iron has one of the highest binding energies, reactions producing heavier elements are generally endothermic. Therefore, significant amounts of heavier elements are not formed during stable periods of massive star evolution, but are formed in supernova explosions. Some lighter stars also form these elements in the outer parts of the stars over long periods of time, by absorbing energy from fusion in the inside of the star, by absorbing neutrons that are emitted from the fusion process.

All of the elements heavier than iron have some potential energy to release, in theory. At the extremely heavy end of element production, these heavier elements can produce energy in the process of being split again back toward the size of iron, in the process of nuclear fission. Nuclear fission thus releases energy that has been stored, sometimes billions of years before, during stellar nucleosynthesis.

=== Magnetic confinement ===

Electrically charged particles (such as fuel ions) will follow magnetic field lines (see Guiding centre). The fusion fuel can therefore be trapped using a strong magnetic field. A variety of magnetic configurations exist, including the toroidal geometries of tokamaks and stellarators and open-ended mirror confinement systems.

=== Inertial confinement ===

A third confinement principle is to apply a rapid pulse of energy to a large part of the surface of a pellet of fusion fuel, causing it to simultaneously &quot;implode&quot; and heat to very high pressure and temperature. If the fuel is dense enough and hot enough, the fusion reaction rate will be high enough to burn a significant fraction of the fuel before it has dissipated. To achieve these extreme conditions, the initially cold fuel must be explosively compressed. Inertial confinement is used in the hydrogen bomb, where the driver is x-rays created by a fission bomb. Inertial confinement is also attempted in &quot;controlled&quot; nuclear fusion, where the driver is a laser, ion, or electron beam, or a Z-pinch. Another method is to use conventional high explosive material to compress a fuel to fusion conditions. The UTIAS explosive-driven-implosion facility was used to produce stable, centred and focused hemispherical implosions to generate neutrons from D-D reactions. The simplest and most direct method proved to be in a predetonated stoichiometric mixture of deuterium-oxygen. The other successful method was using a miniature Voitenko compressor, where a plane diaphragm was driven by the implosion wave into a secondary small spherical cavity that contained pure deuterium gas at one atmosphere.

===Electrostatic confinement ===

There are also electrostatic confinement fusion devices. These devices confine ions using electrostatic fields. The best known is the fusor. This device has a cathode inside an anode wire cage. Positive ions fly towards the negative inner cage, and are heated by the electric field in the process. If they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse. Ions typically hit the cathode, however, creating prohibitory high conduction losses. Also, fusion rates in fusors are very low due to competing physical effects, such as energy loss in the form of light radiation. Designs have been proposed to avoid the problems associated with the cage, by generating the field using a non-neutral cloud. These include a plasma oscillating device, a Penning trap and the polywell. The technology is relatively immature, however, and many scientific and engineering questions remain.

The most well known Inertial electrostatic confinement approach is the fusor. Starting in 1999, a number of amateurs have been able to do amateur fusion using these homemade devices. Other IEC devices include: the Polywell, MIX POPS and Marble concepts.

==Important reactions==

===Stellar reaction chains===
At the temperatures and densities in stellar cores, the rates of fusion reactions are notoriously slow. For example, at solar core temperature (&quot;T&quot; ≈ 15 MK) and density (160 g/cm3), the energy release rate is only 276 μW/cm3—about a quarter of the volumetric rate at which a resting human body generates heat. Thus, reproduction of stellar core conditions in a lab for nuclear fusion power production is completely impractical. Because nuclear reaction rates depend on density as well as temperature, and most fusion schemes operate at relatively low densities, those methods are strongly dependent on higher temperatures. The fusion rate as a function of temperature (exp(−&quot;E&quot;/&quot;kT&quot;)), leads to the need to achieve temperatures in terrestrial reactors 10–100 times higher than in stellar interiors: &quot;T&quot; ≈ .

===Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions===

In artificial fusion, the primary fuel is not constrained to be protons and higher temperatures can be used, so reactions with larger cross-sections are chosen. Another concern is the production of neutrons, which activate the reactor structure radiologically, but also have the advantages of allowing volumetric extraction of the fusion energy and tritium breeding. Reactions that release no neutrons are referred to as &quot;aneutronic&quot;.

To be a useful energy source, a fusion reaction must satisfy several criteria. It must:

;Be exothermic: This limits the reactants to the low &quot;Z&quot; (number of protons) side of the curve of binding energy. It also makes helium the most common product because of its extraordinarily tight binding, although and also show up.
;Involve low atomic number (&quot;Z&quot;) nuclei: This is because the electrostatic repulsion that must be overcome before the nuclei are close enough to fuse ( Coulomb barrier ) is directly related to the number of protons it contains – its atomic number.
;Have two reactants: At anything less than stellar densities, three-body collisions are too improbable. In inertial confinement, both stellar densities and temperatures are exceeded to compensate for the shortcomings of the third parameter of the Lawson criterion, ICF&#x27;s very short confinement time.
;Have two or more products: This allows simultaneous conservation of energy and momentum without relying on the electromagnetic force.
;Conserve both protons and neutrons: The cross sections for the weak interaction are too small.

Few reactions meet these criteria. The following are those with the largest cross sections:


For reactions with two products, the energy is divided between them in inverse proportion to their masses, as shown. In most reactions with three products, the distribution of energy varies. For reactions that can result in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.

Some reaction candidates can be eliminated at once. The D–6Li reaction has no advantage compared to p+– because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially more neutrons through – side reactions. There is also a p+– reaction, but the cross section is far too low, except possibly when &quot;T&quot;&quot;i&quot; &gt; 1 MeV, but at such high temperatures an endothermic, direct neutron-producing reaction also becomes very significant. Finally there is also a p+– reaction, which is not only difficult to burn, but can be easily induced to split into two alpha particles and a neutron.

In addition to the fusion reactions, the following reactions with neutrons are important in order to &quot;breed&quot; tritium in &quot;dry&quot; fusion bombs and some proposed fusion reactors:

The latter of the two equations was unknown when the U.S. conducted the Castle Bravo fusion bomb test in 1954. Being just the second fusion bomb ever tested (and the first to use lithium), the designers of the Castle Bravo &quot;Shrimp&quot; had understood the usefulness of 6Li in tritium production, but had failed to recognize that 7Li fission would greatly increase the yield of the bomb. While 7Li has a small neutron cross-section for low neutron energies, it has a higher cross section above 5 MeV. The 15 Mt yield was 150% greater than the predicted 6 Mt and caused unexpected exposure to fallout.

To evaluate the usefulness of these reactions, in addition to the reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the nuclear cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product required for ignition is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to (see Lawson criterion). (A plasma is &quot;ignited&quot; if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.

Note that many of the reactions form chains. For instance, a reactor fueled with and creates some , which is then possible to use in the – reaction if the energies are &quot;right&quot;. An elegant idea is to combine the reactions (8) and (9). The from reaction (8) can react with in reaction (9) before completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton, which in turn undergoes reaction (8) before thermalizing. Detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work well, but it is a good example of a case where the usual assumption of a Maxwellian plasma is not appropriate.

=== Abundance of the nuclear fusion fuels ===

=== Neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density ===
Any of the reactions above can in principle be the basis of fusion power production. In addition to the temperature and cross section discussed above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion products &quot;E&quot;fus, the energy of the charged fusion products &quot;E&quot;ch, and the atomic number &quot;Z&quot; of the non-hydrogenic reactant.

Specification of the – reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must average over the two branches (2i) and (2ii). More difficult is to decide how to treat the and products. burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to extract from the plasma. The – reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at the optimum – temperature may be low. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume the but not the gets burned up and adds its energy to the net reaction, which means the total reaction would be the sum of (2i), (2ii), and (1):

:5 → + 2 n0 + + p+, &quot;E&quot;fus = 4.03 + 17.6 + 3.27 = 24.9 MeV, &quot;E&quot;ch = 4.03 + 3.5 + 0.82 = 8.35 MeV.

For calculating the power of a reactor (in which the reaction rate is determined by the D–D step), we count the – fusion energy &quot;per D–D reaction&quot; as &quot;E&quot;fus = (4.03 MeV + 17.6 MeV) × 50% + (3.27 MeV) × 50% = 12.5 MeV and the energy in charged particles as &quot;E&quot;ch = (4.03 MeV + 3.5 MeV) × 50% + (0.82 MeV) × 50% = 4.2 MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may be quite different from 3.5 MeV, so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0 MeV (a specific energy of about 225 million MJ per kilogram of deuterium).

Another unique aspect of the – reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.

With this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important reactions

The last column is the neutronicity of the reaction, the fraction of the fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator of the magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is calculated as . For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal equilibrium.

Of course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total pressure is fixed, this means that particle density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of the hydrogenic ion by a factor . Therefore, the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the values of . On the other hand, because the – reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a more efficient reaction.

Thus there is a &quot;penalty&quot; of for non-hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require more electrons, which take up pressure without participating in the fusion reaction. (It is usually a good assumption that the electron temperature will be nearly equal to the ion temperature. Some authors, however, discuss the possibility that the electrons could be maintained substantially colder than the ions. In such a case, known as a &quot;hot ion mode&quot;, the &quot;penalty&quot; would not apply.) There is at the same time a &quot;bonus&quot; of a factor 2 for – because each ion can react with any of the other ions, not just a fraction of them.

We can now compare these reactions in the following table.

The maximum value of is taken from a previous table. The &quot;penalty/bonus&quot; factor is that related to a non-hydrogenic reactant or a single-species reaction. The values in the column &quot;inverse reactivity&quot; are found by dividing by the product of the second and third columns. It indicates the factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than the – reaction under comparable conditions. The column &quot;Lawson criterion&quot; weights these results with &quot;E&quot;ch and gives an indication of how much more difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the difficulty for the – reaction. The next-to-last column is labeled &quot;power density&quot; and weights the practical reactivity by &quot;E&quot;fus. The final column indicates how much lower the fusion power density of the other reactions is compared to the – reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.

===Bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas===

The ions undergoing fusion in many systems will essentially never occur alone but will be mixed with electrons that in aggregate neutralize the ions&#x27; bulk electrical charge and form a plasma. The electrons will generally have a temperature comparable to or greater than that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit x-ray radiation of 10–30 keV energy, a process known as Bremsstrahlung.

The huge size of the Sun and stars means that the x-rays produced in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They are said to be opaque to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be optically thin for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a reactor&#x27;s shield). This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.
The ratio of fusion power produced to x-ray radiation lost to walls is an important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the previous subsection). The following table shows estimates of the optimum temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several reactions:

The actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be significantly lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves &quot;must&quot; remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and &quot;will&quot; remain for some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.

The temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung are in every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value of the fusion triple product. This will not change the optimum operating point for – very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative to – is even lower and the required confinement even more difficult to achieve. For – and –, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive problem. For –, p+– and p+– the Bremsstrahlung losses appear to make a fusion reactor using these fuels with a quasineutral, isotropic plasma impossible. Some ways out of this dilemma have been considered but rejected. This limitation does not apply to non-neutral and anisotropic plasmas; however, these have their own challenges to contend with.

== Mathematical description of cross section ==

=== Fusion under classical physics ===

In a classical picture, nuclei can be understood as hard spheres that repel each other through the Coulomb force but fuse once the two spheres come close enough for contact. Estimating the radius of an atomic nuclei as about one femtometer, the energy needed for fusion of two hydrogen is:

:formula_6

This would imply that for the core of the sun, which has a Boltzmann distribution with a temperature of around 1.4 keV, the probability hydrogen would reach the threshold is formula_7, that is, fusion would never occur. However, fusion in the sun does occur due to quantum mechanics.

=== Parameterization of cross section ===

The probability that fusion occurs is greatly increased compared to the classical picture, thanks to the smearing of the effective radius as the de Broglie wavelength as well as quantum tunneling through the potential barrier. To determine the rate of fusion reactions, the value of most interest is the cross section, which describes the probability that particles will fuse by giving a characteristic area of interaction. An estimation of the fusion cross-sectional area is often broken into three pieces:
:formula_8
where formula_9 is the geometric cross section, is the barrier transparency and is the reaction characteristics of the reaction.

formula_9 is of the order of the square of the de Broglie wavelength formula_11 where formula_12 is the reduced mass of the system and formula_13 is the center of mass energy of the system.

 can be approximated by the Gamow transparency, which has the form: formula_14 where formula_15 is the Gamow factor and comes from estimating the quantum tunneling probability through the potential barrier.

 contains all the nuclear physics of the specific reaction and takes very different values depending on the nature of the interaction. However, for most reactions, the variation of formula_16 is small compared to the variation from the Gamow factor and so is approximated by a function called the astrophysical S-factor, formula_17, which is weakly varying in energy. Putting these dependencies together, one approximation for the fusion cross section as a function of energy takes the form:

:formula_18

More detailed forms of the cross-section can be derived through nuclear physics-based models and R-matrix theory.

=== Formulas of fusion cross sections ===
The Naval Research Lab&#x27;s plasma physics formulary gives the total cross section in barns as a function of the energy (in keV) of the incident particle towards a target ion at rest fit by the formula:

:formula_19 with the following coefficient values:

Bosch-Hale also reports a R-matrix calculated cross sections fitting observation data with Padé rational approximating coefficients. With energy in units of keV and cross sections in units of millibarn, the factor has the form:

:formula_20, with the coefficient values: 

where formula_21

===Maxwell-averaged nuclear cross sections===

In fusion systems that are in thermal equilibrium, the particles are in a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, meaning the particles have a range of energies centered around the plasma temperature. The sun, magnetically confined plasmas and inertial confinement fusion systems are well modeled to be in thermal equilibrium. In these cases, the value of interest is the fusion cross-section averaged across the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. The Naval Research Lab&#x27;s plasma physics formulary tabulates Maxwell averaged fusion cross sections reactivities in formula_22.

For energies formula_23 the data can be represented by:

:formula_24

:formula_25
with in units of keV.
